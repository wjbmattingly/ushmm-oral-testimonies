And it\u2122s like an -- like we\u2122d call here ROTC. And I reported to the -- to an artillery regiment, which was an exclusive regiment at that time, and my uncle helped me. And served for three months, going in in January 1938. And I was out of town on maneuvers, and March the 14th we -- there were rumors that the Germans may take over Austria, Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12, 2002 15and Chancellor chus -- Schuschnigg at that time said that he does not want to see any blood flowing in the streets of Vienna, or for Austria, or the entire country. And he would not issue any -- any orders to fight or anything. Those were the initial orders given, and of course we, as a military unit, we were prepared. Suddenly, over -- it was a weekend, Saturday to Sunday, when the invasion started. And of course my commanding officer knew that the -- I -- a-as a matter of fact, I think I was the only Jew in the whole regiment. And he imme diately notified me that I could go take the next train back to Vienna to see my parents. And that he would see me again in the barracks back in Vienna, because they were packing up and ready to go back to Vienna. And that was one sight I will never forget. When I arrived at the railroad station in Vienna, I was in uniform, in the Austrian uniform, military uniform. When I arrived in Vienna, got off, got out on the street, I couldn\u2122t believe that I -- I wa s in -- in a city where I not only was born, but raised and went to school. It was a completely stra nge atmosphere. First of all, there were people on the streets. Everybody had either a flag or an armband, Nazi armband. Flags all over the place, which never occurred during my lifetime in Vienna. And I took the streetcar, go home, and I noticed of course at -- at that time, at th -- at this particular moment I didn\u2122t know that they were all Jews who were down on their knees scrubbing the sidewalks. And I just couldn\u2122t -- couldn\u2122t believe, couldn\u2122t see Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12, 2002 16it. And I got home and met my parents. And my father -- that was on a Sunday when I arrived, my father went to the office the next day on Monday, and when he got -- got there, there were two Gestapo men waiting in front of his office. And they introduced themselves and said that they were here to transfer the business over to the German banks. And as a matter of fact it was -- I think it was like a contract, that he would be safe under their control until September the first of 1938. And they were more or less watching ever y move he made durin g that period, and in the meantime, my -- my mother contacted my fa mily in the -- in the United States and started procedure, getting an affi davit to get me out. At that time we also unfortunately found out that as far as I\u2122m concerned, I could leave Vienna without any problems as a -- soon as I got my visa. But my parents, unfortunately, my father was under the Russian quota and my mother came under the Polish quota. Both of those quotas were -- were closed, and they just could not get a visa to get to United States , so naturally -- we had contacts in Yugoslavia and other places and my parents were able to arrange -- leave here now to go first to Yugoslavia . But going back to -- to myself, on Monday morning I got back to the barracks, to my barracks, and believe me or not, I got into my room and I couldn\u2122t find any of the -- my personal belongings . And, as a matter of fact, the whole regiment couldn\u2122t find anythi ng of their own belongings. And what we found out is Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12, 2002 17the German -- Germans moved in. As a matter of fact when I arrived in the barracks, I saw the Germans drilling on -- on -- on the field, just like it was theirs."

And you were telling me about the barracks, coming back to your barracks and what you found there. And if you would, please continue.",
            "answer": "As I said, when I came back into the barracks, I couldn\u2122t find my personal belongings and we later fo und out that the Germans just took over and threw everything down into the cellar of the barra cks. So we all had to scramble and find our things. I eventually did. I immediat ely contacted my commanding officer about the situation, that my parents a-are going to get me out as quick ly as possible. And so he said don\u2122t worry about it. Of course, I also explained to my commanding officer that I couldn\u2122t leave Vienna until I get my mili -- mil -- military passport, because those are requirements to get the visa. So he said don\u2122t worry about it, I\u2122ll Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12, 2002 18take care of everything. I was in the Austrian uniform for almost two weeks -- over two weeks, as a matter of fact, which he lped me considerably, moving around the city without any fear. And so the day when the commanding officer had the military passport for me, he called me in the office and said, now here\u2122s the passport, but I won\u2122t give it to you. I said, why won\u2122t you give it? He said, because I want to make sure that you\u2122re gonna deposit th -- in the American embassy, where it belongs. I said, well then, let -- take it out, I\u2122m going to the embassy right now. He said, no, I\u2122m going to call a taxi fo r you, put you in the taxi and -- and you -- you take it. Which I did, and I went to the embassy directly from the barracks and deposited a passport in the embassy and then went home. Of course, after that I had to take off my military uniform because I was not in the military any more, I was discharged; although I was, up until 1956, I was considered a reserve officer in the Austrian army, wa -- at that time of course, in the German army. And as a matter of fact, I still have my military passport with me. And so a -- twice -- we -- we lived in a -- an apartment building and [indecipherable] apartment building near the American -- well, wi -- American embassy as a m -- as a matter of fact, a new American embassy after the war is located within a block, walking distance from where I used to live. And w -- our concierge was very cognizant of the situation and always informed us whenev er the Gestapo came by to inquire about Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12, 2002 19the Jewish residents, to notify us that they were here. And so whenever that happened, my parents of course were safe because my father had the contract with the Germans to be in his office until September the first, but for me, I had to leave the city twice. And just went to the far -- far suburbs of do -- Vienna, and stayed there for about a week, then I came back again. Well, fina lly I received my visa in June of 1938 and packed everything up, wh-what I wanted. And of course I could not leave Vienna with more than eight dollars in my pocket to go to United States . And of course my father, being in a ba nk, he arranged prior, long prior, my -- before my departure, to have mo ney picked up in -- in twa -- in Paris when I arrived there from Vienna, which I did, was very lucky. Of course, everything -- before I left Vienna, my passage was completely paid and taken care of from France to the United States. And of course I was concerned about my parents, what -- what will happen to them, but luckily they were -- they got the visa to Yugoslavia . It\u2122s only for about I think six weeks. And then they traveled to Italy and from Italy they went to France . And in the meantime, my uncle who had -- who lived in Philadelphia, and he had contacts with the State department, and arrangements were made that my parent s take a -- buy a round trip ticket -- of course sh -- that\u2122s the only thing they could buy, a round trip ticket to the West Indies, a cruise to the West Indies and arrive in Cuba. And so naturally my Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12, 2002 20parents bought s-some cruise tickets in Paris, and they left France on that cruise ship in 1940. And they cruised and of -- when they arrived in -- in ha -- in Santiago de Cuba, the port, the representative of the American embassy in -- in Havana that greeted them and took them off the ship. And my parents stayed in Havana for -- until April of 1941, when they finally got their visa to enter the United States, they came. So that is my story."

Apparently they needed some translators. So I went up there, was -- had an interview at nine o\u2122clock in the morning and we had a very pleasant meeting. And the last ques tion he asked me, he said to me, are you a citizen of the United States? I said no, but I -- I already -- already applied for my -- for my second papers. I do -- I do have them. So he said to me, I don\u2122t care. And he pounded his fist on his table and said I don\u2122t care if even President Roosevelt is going to ask me to give you a job, I will not. That was that. That was my experience, my first experience trying for a job in -- in the United States. So I Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12, 2002 33went back home and I told my -- my uncle about it. He says well, let me call Mr. Sharfson , and he called him. So the guy says to him, well, don\u2122t worry about it, I\u2122ll get him an -- a job. And sure enough, two days later I had an interview in the Litz department store in Philadelphia in the advertising department. And so I -- I - I worked there until I went to the service in February of \u212241. And thit -- the what I did is, since I was musically inclined and knowledgeable in a way, I -- the department store had, every Sunday morni ng, a two hour classical music -- a -- a music hour, two hours. And I was in charge to arrange the program every Sunday morning. So that was a nice, interesting job for me to do. And of course I had to be careful, using the -- the time properly with -- with the commercials and so on.

And I\u2122d also like you to tell me if you were drafted, or if you volunteered.",
            "answer": "Well, so as I -- as I was saying, I was proud to make my ow -- have my own money and do as I pleased. And in the mean -- also, I continued taking my lessons, singing lessons at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia. And then in Octob -- was it October or November of 1940, Congress drafted th-the bill for conscriptions. And at that time when -- you had to go to th e draft board and report, and -- and they gave you a number when you -- when -- the numb -- yeah, the number was a number -- if you had a low number that m eans that you -- they would call you for duty in a -- in a short time. An-And unfortunately, I -- I had an -- well f -- actually fortunately I had a low number. And it was, of course, winter of \u212240 - \u212241, and in those days, of course, you only served for one year. That -- that\u2122s the time period. So I liked having had the experience in the military in Austria. Of course, I was Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12, 2002 35aware that the summertime, especially the summertime in the Amer -- in the American camps, I -- I found out were located, most of them in -- in the beginning of the -- the war, in -- in the south. So -- and I always hated hot weather. So I figured well, if I can -- since I have a low number, I found out when they\u2122re going to call me, which I did and they told me, well, your number would indicate that you probably will -- will be called in April or May. So I said, April or May? I said -- so I asked him, would -- could they take me now if I -- if I decide? But of course, I have to check with my boss first. He sa id well, if you want -- want to volunteer, we\u2122ll take you in right now if you want to. Said no, le-let\u2122s wait. I went back to my job and I talked to the boss and he said fine, go. If you feel -- if you want to go now, go ahead and go into the service. We\u2122ll keep the job for you. When you come back, I guarantee you, you will have your job back. So with that, I felt good about it. I went back to the draft board. That was about -- must have been about January and I volunteered for a year, and February 18 th of 1941, I went to the service. I was taken to Fort Dix in New Jersey and I had my physical a nd I had interviews. I had the intelligence test and during the intelligence test they asked me, do you have any special -- special unit you would like to join? So I said, well I really -- I really don\u2122t care. So the -- the interviewer says, well, you have engineering background and you wa -- do -- what-what else di d he say? Don\u2122t -- don\u2122t remember. Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12, 2002 36Engineering background and what was the other one? Oh, the military service, of course, in the Austrian Army. So wha-what would you lik e, engineering? I said, I really don\u2122t care. I\u2122ll just go in and finish my year and that\u2122s all I\u2122m interested. So they sent me to Fort Bell wa -- which is -- which is an engineer camp, and -- and I went there and they put me into mapmaking. And of cour se, that\u2122s my -- my forte. I like geography and of course, in my e ngineering ground -- background helped me to learn quickly how to make maps. My ma th and -- and geology is included in -- in that. And I -- I started out as a private in 1941, and shortly I became promoted and my commanding officer and the executive officer of the battalion which I-I was attached to, came over to the drafting room every morning for inspection. And as I was sitting in my drafting table and so my commanding officer and my b -- company officer st-stayed th -- I -- I was the only table, always stopped, talking to me. At the other tables they just passed by. He says well, how\u2122s my little refugee feel today? You gained some more weight . And so came -- was in November, or -- or must have been end of November or early December, that was December seventh. Yeah, it was December seventh, of course. Was December seventh, it was in a Sunday. A friend of mine, we took off. I got a pass to go into town. We went to Washington and the reason was that th-the [indecipherable] choir gave a concert the Constitution Hall at three o\u2122clock in the afternoon. Well, in those days, Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12, 2002 37before the war s -- before the United States was involved in the war, of course, they -- they didn\u2122t care too much for the soldiers. And -- so we went to the Constitution Hall and it was all sold out, no ti ckets available. Otherwise in the -- in the later days, after the war started, well they gave you free tickets and everything was available for the -- for the u -- United States soldier. So we wound up in the -- went to the Library of Congress to play some chess. But five o\u2122clock was the time for the Library of Congress to close, so we returned the chess set, and the guy behind the counter said, okay, good luck boys, won\u2122t see you any more. I said, what -- what do you mean, won\u2122t see you a ny more? That was five o\u2122clock in the afternoon, December 7th, 1941. So he said, well don\u2122t you know that Pearl Harbor was -- was bombed? Pearl Harbor was bombed? What? We went out -- well, it was really chaos in -- in the city of Washington . There were army trucks all over, picking up all the soldiers from th -- on the streets and taking them back to the camps. Well, we decided we\u2122re not going to get caught. We went through side streets and though alleys and we wound up at Basil\u2122s delicatessen on Pennsylvania Avenue and E Street, and we figured we\u2122ll have the last good Jewish meal. And we came back -- we took the bus back to the camp, to Fort Belvoir and my God, everybody was packin g, everybody was ready to go. But Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12, 2002 38luckily our outfit was attached to general headquarters in Washington, so -- and of course we were not involved in that . So that\u2122s -- that\u2122s my story."

We -- I myself put in anywhere from 10 to 12 hours a day to prepare all the maps necessary for the -- for north Africa especially at that -- at that time. And in 1942, when things became more and more involved for the United States , our general headquarters decided to send us overseas to be attached to a general headquarters in Europe. And at that time also there was -- they started to prepare for the European invasion, and that would be a good location to do what we ha ve to do. Unfortunately, or fortunately, whichever, I was still not a citizen, and even though my commanding officer did his utmost to take me along, the war de partment -- at that time war department would not allow me to go because it was too dangerous if I were captured as a -- I was still, more or less I -- an Austrian, or an enemy, anyway. And so they kept me here and they formed a new cadre for a new battalion for mapmaking, because they needed more than one, so of course I wa s left back in the United States and we formed a new ou-outfit. And -- and we -- we put all these newcomers through basic training like I used to go through, in th e beginning. And -- and we worked. We\u2122re still attached to general headquarters in th -- Washington . And then come 1940 -- \u212243 -- of course I was a citizen in April, but in November of 1943, our out -- the new outfit was sent to north Africa, and that\u2122s where I left for overseas in November of 1943. A nd I stayed in north Africa for about a year. We took over a Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12, 2002 40little French si -- town, little ti -- cher -- Cherchell. And we set up shop there and did a lot of work for th e invasion of southern France with the seventh army, and also worked for General Mark Clark in -- in Italy. And started preparing, as a matter of fact, started preparing to work -- make military maps of Austria. And of course, I was in charge, naturally. But we did not finish it because we were asked to be sent back to United States and back to the Pacific, and we went to Hawaii . We attached to Pacific Ocean headquarters and started to work on all the invasion maps of the islands and Japan and so on. And as a matter of fact, on -- on V -- not so V -- no. Yeah, V-J day, that\u2122s when the -- when Japan finally gave up. On V-J day the war didn\u2122t end for our outfit, because it just so happened that we worked on Tokyo bay and General mar -- MacArthur would not move in with the Missouri into the bay, unless he has all the information available to him. He just didn\u2122t trust these guys, naturally. And so we -- for us the war wasn\u2122t over until two weeks after V-J day. And we finally were finished and that was in \u212245. And I was dischar -- discharged in November of 1945 . And when my wife picked me up from Fort Mead , she told me that there was a letter from the war department waiting for me. And of course, I -- at that point I did not have any idea what I\u2122m going to do. And I -- I would not go back to Philadelphia because my wife is a Washingtonian Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12, 2002 41and she has all her family and friends here and so I decided we\u2122re going to raise a family here, in Washington area."

The streetcars are numbered, they go in the same places I\u2122m used to, the buses, nothing has change d. And I was glad to see that, although Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12, 2002 51the people were a little bit sour. I don\u2122t know why. Just because I was there, maybe, I don\u2122t know. But anyway, the second visit we had is when my granddaughter spent her college semester in -- in Florence , and we all visited then. And that was really a -- the best time I\u2122ve had with my children and grandchildren, when we went to Vienna. We met them -- we visited the first -- well, we went to o -- Vienna first and then my daughter and he r husband and their three daughters joined us in Vienna when they came up from Florence. And we spent eight days in Vienna and I took them through the whole city, and I took them to the elementary school where I used to go to. But -- this is the nice thing about Vienna is -- compared to the United States , they\u2122d rather destroy and build new in the United States, but in Vienna they -- they\u2122re trying to -- to keep it the way it is and maintain it properly. But anyway, [indecipherable] elementary school and my youngest granddaughter was a -- I think ab out seven or eight years old, and of course she just enjoyed it. I took her to the classroom where I was sitting for my -- my sec -- my second grade. And as a matter of fact it was a Saturday afternoon. Of course, school are still there Saturday -- Saturday morning, half d -- half day school on Saturday, so we just arrived there wh en the children left, and I was waiting until they are all out, and then I walked in with my family and took them into the school building. And in the classroom, one of the classroom the teacher was still there and Interview with Norbert Hilsberg August 12, 2002 52says, I told her, but she just couldn't belie ve it. She couldn\u2122t believe it. And I took her to the apartment where we used to live and of course that was a really high moment in my life, because I -- I noticed the children in my family were so interested in seeing where I grew up. And -- and the third time was in 1990. We took a talk tour to ma -- eastern Europe and we wound up in Vienna for the third time. And as a matter of fact, I did visit Auschwitz when I was in Poland and it was devastating really, even now. And I was in Krak\u00f3w and I was in [indecipherable] Budapest and then I would up in Vienna. And in those -- as a matter of fact, I didn\u2122t mention that in the second visit to Vienna with my family, I -- that was in -- in ninet -- in 1990 and that was a complete turnaround as far as being a visitor there. People seemed to be very polite, very helpful, very pleasant and it was almost like being in any other city in the United States , really. But if course, in the back of -- of our head there was still -- still the past, naturally. And bif -- the third time, just a few years ago, and it was the same. I enjoyed it while I was there for about three days. And that\u2122s it."
