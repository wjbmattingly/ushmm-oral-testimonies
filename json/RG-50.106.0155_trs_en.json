            "answer": "Well, that\u2019s a good question, because as I graduate the college, I also had to have -- had to serve three months in the military. And it\u2019s like an -- like we\u2019d call here ROTC. And I reported to the -- to an artillery regiment, which was an exclusive regiment at that time, and my uncle helped me. And served for three months, going in in January 1938. And I was out of town on maneuvers, and March the 14\" we -- there were rumors that the Germans may take over Austria, Interview with Norbert Hilsberg : August 12, 2002 and Chancellor chus -- Schuschnigg at that time said that he does not want to see any blood flowing in the streets of Vienna, or for Austria, or the entire country. And he would not issue any -- any orders to fight or anything. Those were the initial orders given, and of course we, as a military unit, we were prepared. Suddenly, over -- it was a weekend, Saturday to Sunday, when the invasion started. And of course my commanding officer knew that the -- I -- a-as a matter of fact, I think I was the only Jew in the whole regiment. And he immediately notified me that I could go take the next train back to Vienna to see my parents. And that he would see me again in the barracks back in Vienna, because they were packing up and ready to go back to Vienna. And that was one sight I will never forget. When I arrived at the railroad station in Vienna, I was in uniform, in the Austrian uniform, military uniform. When I arrived in Vienna, got off, got out on the street, I couldn\u2019t believe that I -- I was in -- in a city where I not only was born, but raised and went to school. It was a completely strange atmosphere. First of all, there were people on the streets. Everybody had either a flag or an armband, Nazi armband. Flags all over the place, which never occurred during my lifetime in Vienna. And I took the streetcar, go home, and I noticed of course at -- at that time, at th -- at this particular moment I didn\u2019t know that they were all Jews who were down on their knees scrubbing the sidewalks. And I just couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t believe, couldn\u2019t see Interview with Norbert Hilsberg ie August 12, 2002 it. And I got home and met my parents. And my father -- that was on a Sunday when I arrived, my father went to the office the next day on Monday, and when he got -- got there, there were two Gestapo men waiting in front of his office. And they introduced themselves and said that they were here to transfer the business over to the German banks. And as a matter of fact 1t was -- I think it was like a contract, that he would be safe under their control until September the first of 1938. And they were more or less watching every move he made during that period, and in the meantime, my -- my mother contacted my family in the -- in the United States and started procedure, getting an affidavit to get me out. At that time we also unfortunately found out that as far as I\u2019m concerned, I could leave Vienna without any problems as a -- soon as I got my visa. But my parents, unfortunately, my father was under the Russian quota and my mother came under the Polish quota. Both of those quotas were -- were closed, and they just could not get a visa to get to United States, so naturally -- we had contacts in Yugoslavia and other places and my parents were able to arrange -- leave here now to go first to Yugoslavia. But going back to -- to myself, on Monday morning I got back to the barracks, to my barracks, and believe me or not, I got into my room and I couldn\u2019t find any of the -- my personal belongings. And, as a matter of fact, the whole regiment couldn\u2019t find anything of their own belongings. And what we found out is Interview with Norbert Hilsberg \" August 12, 2002 the German -- Germans moved in. As a matter of fact when I arrived in the barracks, I saw the Germans drilling on -- on -- on the field, just like it was theirs."

And you were telling me about the barracks, coming back to your barracks and what you found there. And if you would, please continue.",
            "answer": "As I said, when I came back into the barracks, I couldn\u2019t find my personal belongings and we later found out that the Germans just took over and threw everything down into the cellar of the barracks. So we all had to scramble and find our things. I eventually did. I immediately contacted my commanding officer about the situation, that my parents a-are going to get me out as quickly as possible. And so he said don\u2019t worry about it. Of course, I also explained to my commanding officer that I couldn\u2019t leave Vienna until I get my mili -- mil -- military passport, because those are requirements to get the visa. So he said don\u2019t worry about it, I'll Interview with Norbert Hilsberg \" August 12, 2002 take care of everything. I was in the Austrian uniform for almost two weeks -- over two weeks, as a matter of fact, which helped me considerably, moving around the city without any fear. And so the day when the commanding officer had the military passport for me, he called me in the office and said, now here\u2019s the passport, but I won\u2019t give it to you. I said, why won\u2019t you give it? He said, because I want to make sure that you\u2019re gonna deposit th -- in the American embassy, where it belongs. I said, well then, let -- take it out, I\u2019m going to the embassy right now. He said, no, I\u2019m going to call a taxi for you, put you in the taxi and -- and you- you take it. Which I did, and I went to the embassy directly from the barracks and deposited a passport in the embassy and then went home. Of course, after that I had to take off my military uniform because I was not in the military any more, I was discharged; although I was, up until 1956, I was considered a reserve officer in the Austrian army, wa -- at that time of course, in the German army. And as a matter of fact, I still have my military passport with me. And so a -- twice -- we -- we lived in a -- an apartment building and [indecipherable] apartment building near the American -- well, wi -- American embassy as a m -- as a matter of fact, a new American embassy after the war is located within a block, walking distance from where I used to live. And w -- our concierge was very cognizant of the situation and always informed us whenever the Gestapo came by to inquire about Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Norbert Hilsberg \u00a9 August 12, 2002 the Jewish residents, to notify us that they were here. And so whenever that happened, my parents of course were safe because my father had the contract with the Germans to be in his office until September the first, but for me, I had to leave the city twice. And just went to the far -- far suburbs of do -- Vienna, and stayed there for about a week, then I came back again. Well, finally I received my visa in June of 1938 and packed everything up, wh-what I wanted. And of course I could not leave Vienna with more than eight dollars in my pocket to go to United States. And of course my father, being in a bank, he arranged prior, long prior, my -- before my departure, to have money picked up in -- in twa -- in Paris when I arrived there from Vienna, which I did, was very lucky. Of course, everything -- before I left Vienna, my passage was completely paid and taken care of from France to the United States. And of course I was concerned about my parents, what -- what will happen to them, but luckily they were -- they got the visa to Yugoslavia. It\u2019s only for about I think six weeks. And then they traveled to Italy and from Italy they went to France. And in the meantime, my uncle who had -- who lived in Philadelphia, and he had contacts with the State department, and arrangements were made that my parents take a -- buy a round trip ticket -- of course sh -- that\u2019s the only thing they could buy, a round trip ticket to the West Indies, a cruise to the West Indies and arrive in Cuba. And so naturally my Interview with Norbert Hilsberg \u201c August 12, 2002 parents bought s-some cruise tickets in Paris, and they left France on that cruise ship in 1940. And they cruised and of -- when they arrived in -- in ha -- in Santiago de Cuba, the port, the representative of the American embassy in -- in Havana that greeted them and took them off the ship. And my parents stayed in Havana for -- until April of 1941, when they finally got their visa to enter the United States, they came. So that is my story."

He says well, let me call Mr. Sharfson, and he called him. So the guy says to him, well, don\u2019t worry about it, Pll get him an -- a job. And sure enough, two days later I had an interview in the Litz department store in Philadelphia in the advertising department. And so I -- I - | worked there until I went to the service in February of \u201941. And thit -- the what I did is, since I was musically inclined and knowledgeable in a way, I -- the department store had, every Sunday morning, a two hour classical music -- a -- a music hour, two hours.

            "answer": "Well, so as I -- as I was saying, I was proud to make my ow -- have my own money and do as I pleased. And in the mean -- also, I continued taking my lessons, singing lessons at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia. And then in Octob -- was it October or November of 1940, Congress drafted th-the bill for conscriptions.

And it was, of course, winter of \u201940 - \u201941, and in those days, of course, you only served for one year. That -- that\u2019s the time period. So I liked having had the experience in the military in Austria. Of course, I was Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Norbert Hilsberg * August 12, 2002 aware that the summertime, especially the summertime in the Amer -- in the American camps, I -- I found out were located, most of them in -- in the beginning of the -- the war, in -- in the south. So -- and I always hated hot weather. So I figured well, if I can -- since I have a low number, I found out when they\u2019re going to call me, which I did and they told me, well, your number would indicate that you probably will -- will be called in April or May. So I said, April or May? I said- so I asked him, would -- could they take me now if I -- if I decide? But of course, I have to check with my boss first.

So with that, I felt good about it. | went back to the draft board. That was about -- must have been about January and I volunteered for a year, and February 18\" of 1941, I went to the service. I was taken to Fort Dix in New Jersey and I had my physical and I had interviews. I had the intelligence test and during the intelligence test they asked me, do you have any special -- special unit you would like to join? So I said, well I really -- I really don\u2019t care. So the -- the interviewer says, well, you have engineering background and you wa -- do -- what-what else did he say? Don\u2019t -- don\u2019t remember. Interview with Norbert Hilsberg *\u00b0 August 12, 2002 Engineering background and what was the other one? Oh, the military service, of course, in the Austrian Army. So wha-what would you like, engineering? I said, I really don\u2019t care. I\u2019Il just go in and finish my year and that\u2019s all I\u2019m interested. So they sent me to Fort Bell wa -- which is -- which is an engineer camp, and -- and | went there and they put me into mapmaking. And of course, that\u2019s my -- my forte. I like geography and of course, in my engineering ground -- background helped me to learn quickly how to make maps. My math and -- and geology 1s included in -- in that. And I -- I started out as a private in 1941, and shortly I became promoted and my commanding officer and the executive officer of the battalion which I-I was attached to, came over to the drafting room every morning for inspection. And as I was sitting in my drafting table and so my commanding officer and my b -- company officer st-stayed th -- I -- I was the only table, always stopped, talking to me. At the other tables they just passed by. He says well, how\u2019s my little refugee feel today? You gained some more weight. And so came -- was in November, or -- or must have been end of November or early December, that was December seventh. Yeah, it was December seventh, of course. Was December seventh, it was in a Sunday. A friend of mine, we took off. I got a pass to go into town. We went to Washington and the reason was that th-the [indecipherable] choir gave a concert the Constitution Hall at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon. Well, in those days, Interview with Norbert Hilsberg 7 August 12, 2002 before the war s -- before the United States was involved in the war, of course, they -- they didn\u2019t care too much for the soldiers. And -- so we went to the Constitution Hall and it was all sold out, no tickets available. Otherwise in the -- in the later days, after the war started, well they gave you free tickets and everything was available for the -- for the u -- United States soldier. So we wound up in the -- went to the Library of Congress to play some chess. But five o\u2019clock was the time for the Library of Congress to close, so we returned the chess set, and the guy behind the counter said, okay, good luck boys, won\u2019t see you any more. I said, what -- what do you mean, won\u2019t see you any more? That was five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, December 7\", 1941. So he said, well don\u2019t you know that Pearl Harbor was -- was bombed? Pearl Harbor was bombed? What? We went out -- well, it was really chaos in -- in the city of Washington. There were army trucks all over, picking up all the soldiers from th -- on the streets and taking them back to the camps. Well, we decided we\u2019re not going to get caught. We went through side streets and though alleys and we wound up at Basil\u2019s delicatessen on Pennsylvania Avenue and E Street, and we figured we\u2019ll have the last good Jewish meal. And we came back -- we took the bus back to the camp, to Fort Belvoir and my God, everybody was packing, everybody was ready to go. But Interview with Norbert Hilsberg . August 12, 2002 luckily our outfit was attached to general headquarters in Washington, so -- and of course we were not involved in that. So that\u2019s -- that\u2019s my story."

We -- I myself put in anywhere from 10 to 12 hours a day to prepare all the maps necessary for the -- for north Africa especially at that -- at that time. And in 1942, when things became more and more involved for the United States, our general headquarters decided to send us overseas to be attached to a general headquarters in Europe. And at that time also there was -- they started to prepare for the European invasion, and that would be a good location to do what we have to do. Unfortunately, or fortunately, whichever, I was still not a citizen, and even though my commanding officer did his utmost to take me along, the war department -- at that time war department would not allow me to go because it was too dangerous if I were captured as a -- I was still, more or less I -- an Austrian, or an enemy, anyway. And so they kept me here and they formed a new cadre for a new battalion for mapmaking, because they needed more than one, so of course I was left back in the United States and we formed a new ou-outfit.

And then come 1940 -- \u201943 -- of course I was a citizen in April, but in November of 1943, our out -- the new outfit was sent to north Africa, and that\u2019s where I left for overseas in November of 1943. And I stayed in north Africa for about a year. We took over a Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Norbert Hilsberg \u201d August 12, 2002 little French si -- town, little ti -- cher -- Cherchell. And we set up shop there and did a lot of work for the invasion of southern France with the seventh army, and also worked for General Mark Clark in -- in Italy.

But we did not finish 1t because we were asked to be sent back to United States and back to the Pacific, and we went to Hawaii.

And I was dischar -- discharged in November of 1945. And when my wife picked me up from Fort Mead, she told me that there was a letter from the war department waiting for me.

They -- they seemed to feel that th -- we\u2019re Jewish. They did not go out of their way to help us or talk to us, give us service and so on. But I also must say that I left in \u00b038 and I came back in \u201971, that the city itself has not changed a bit. Everything 1s the same. The streetcars are numbered, they go in the same places I\u2019m used to, the buses, nothing has changed.

We met them -- we visited the first -- well, we went to o- Vienna first and then my daughter and her husband and their three daughters joined us in Vienna when they came up from Florence. And we spent eight days in Vienna and [| took them through the whole city, and I took them to the elementary school where I used to go to. But -- this 1s the nice thing about Vienna is -- compared to the United States, they\u2019d rather destroy and build new in the United States, but in Vienna they -- they\u2019re trying to -- to keep it the way it is and maintain it properly. But anyway, [indecipherable] elementary school and my youngest granddaughter was a -- I think about seven or eight years old, and of course she just enjoyed it. I took her to the classroom where I was sitting for my -- my sec -- my second grade. And as a matter of fact 1t was a Saturday afternoon. Of course, school are still there Saturday -- Saturday morning, half d -- half day school on Saturday, so we just arrived there when the children left, and I was waiting until they are all out, and then I walked in with my family and took them into the school building.

She couldn\u2019t believe it. And I took her to the apartment where we used to live and of course that was a really high moment in my life, because I -- I noticed the children in my family were so interested in seeing where I grew up. And -- and the third time was in 1990. We took a talk tour to ma -- eastern Europe and we wound up in Vienna for the third time. And as a matter of fact, I did visit Auschwitz when I was in Poland and it was devastating really, even now. And I was in Krakow and I was in [indecipherable] Budapest and then I would up in Vienna. And in those -- as a matter of fact, I didn\u2019t mention that in the second visit to Vienna with my family, I- that was in -- in ninet -- in 1990 and that was a complete turnaround as far as being a visitor there. People seemed to be very polite, very helpful, very pleasant and it was almost like being 1n any other city in the United States, really. But if course, in the back of -- of our head there was still -- still the past, naturally. And bif -- the third time, just a few years ago, and it was the same.

It\u2019s very possible that they -- they felt bad about it, too, but after all, they had to survive, and they had to do whatever they had to do. I do have one experience myself.
