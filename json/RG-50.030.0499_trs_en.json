I was smart enough, I was not -- I didn\u2019t have a mental delusion. I was looking for what it is. Here I was -- my father was working his rear end to go ahead and send me to school, my only preoccupation was to make a decent grade, which I tried to do a little bit by studying, but a lot by cheating. And I become a expert -- 1f I would study so hard as I study how to cheat to pass a test, I'd be a genius. Innovation that you -- is unbelievable. I don\u2019t know if that interested you, but I want to tell you, the -- my math -- can I imagine I\u2019m studying architectural engineering, I\u2019m trying to cheat on math. I mean to tell you, it\u2019s mind boggling. But my professor of math, he liked me a lot. He took such a personal interest in me, that if I would ditch classes, he would take a Como paper and see what movie I\u2019d be hiding, and actually after classes, he would come in the movie, dig me out and give me a big speech, aren\u2019t you ashamed, your father is working on the bicycle selling the soap from one little town to the other so you can go to the school, and -- and he flunked me. And he tutor me the whole summer for free. You cannot be engineer if you don\u2019t know the math. Til the last test. Now, we already know we have to leave for America, so we figure out I\u2019m going to get at least the paper in order so I can continue in the States to get my degree. And I know I can never do it, because I know it would be a very difficult test. So the friend of mine who was really [indecipherable] in math, and we had at the same time a German test, so he was Italian guy who di -- his father had a visual optical audio store. So I told you what- tell you what I do. You help me to get me two hearing aids, and I will help you with the German test. So he brought me bunch of wire, I sit in the last row and I run a wire through my sleeve, through the steam pipe down in the basement, and I had a little mike in my hand, and my fa -- my friend down in the boiler room. So as soon as he wrote the -- our test on the blackboard, I wrote it -- you know, I -- I -- whispered to my friend down in the boiler room, it took him exactly 10 minutes to develop the test. And I was so delighted that I copied it, now is a problem to get out of this gizmo that I got. So I took a knife, I cut the wire -- because I was wired clear down to the basement, and once you go ahead and -- and I was so excited that I send my -- instead of hanging to the paper and breaking my head, blah, blah, blah, I turn it to him. And then my pr -- my fres -- my professor, and he looked at me, he says, \u201cZdenko, are you sure you\u2019re done?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah I\u2019m done.\u201d He se -- he let me go. Rest of them took additional hours. Now ca -- we come back to the class and he says, \u201cYou know, guys, I\u2019m embarrassed. You took one hour, two hours, here Mr. Bergl, 45 minutes. Now Mr. Bergl is a smart guy, he\u2019s going to come to the blackboard and show us how he done it.\u201d That\u2019s the end of the show. Flunked me. There were made a -- make up exam in September, and one month later, was November we were on the way for America. But he -- he helped me enough to pass the test. Now fast forward 25 years later, \u2019m coming to Como. I invite my professor for lunch with my father and my mother. Meet my wife. And my professor tell me, he says, \u201cZdenko, I\u2019m teaching there for 45 years, I know the kids cheat. Please, how did you do it?\u201d And then I told him."

That was my mother, Winkler\u2019s mother, Evie\u2019s mother, and all that, that in front of the building they were living is a little park with the benches. So all those ladies in their leisure time, under these pine trees, they were observing the traffic, who is coming, who is coming, who is waiting, who -- who 1s cheating on who. They were like a executive committee. And Evie, of course was always -- her mother keep a very close eye on her, where she is going. And I was hanging with Evie\u2019s brother, with this Winkler and all of them. And my only job in Cinecitta is make to Evie miserable. And we -- like we went to a beach, and Evie\u2019s laying on the beach with clothes on. I went to kiss her, she went ballistic. And I didn\u2019t kiss her in any romantic way, I just know that she\u2019s going to be pissed, and it worked. And you know, as long as we were in Cinecitta, I absolutely was romantic. Only later when Evie left for America, after I was already going to school in Como, and I never thought that we are going to make a connection again. It happened purely accidentally because when we arrive in New York, week before Thanksgiving, or few days before, of 1949, Evie said that -- I don\u2019t know how she tell the story how we met. The fact it is the \u201cNew York Times,\u201d ran a picture of my family in the front page, like an [indecipherable] with the valise, cardboard valise, the refugee for Naples, because most of refugee coming to New York were from Bremenhaven. We were from Naples. So they have us there, it just purely accidental. And Evie\u2019s mother saw the picture, and then she start calling Jewish services, and we didn\u2019t continue for Kansas City because my Uncle Radon was living already in New York. So we were his houseguests for two weeks. And as soon as she find out that we are living in Manhattan, Heinz, Evie\u2019s brother come to pick us up and the first Thanksgiving in America, we passed it with Evie and his family. And then I went to the army. Now, when I went to the army, and I didn\u2019t keep in touch with them -- I visited them occasionally, New York with her brother, but nothing, nothing, nothing to do with Evie. When I was drafted, like year and half later, and I\u2019m in Fort Lee, Virginia, in the desert training, every weekend we go -- jumped 1n the car -- matter of fact, you know, in army post you have this Saturday morning parade, and I figure a way how to beat this parade. Was a Brooklyn Jewish kid, his name was Marda from Brooklyn, he had the car. So Marda we go to Brooklyn, I get a ride, he says, you get a ride if you go to the first sergeant and you get a pass for me. And I come very good with the first sergeant, he -- he -- his name was Ara Bernasconi. Italian guy. So I was kind of -- got thick with him, and I didn\u2019t have no problem getting passes. Problem it was get out of the parade Saturday morning so you could not leave til noon. And if you leave Saturday noon for New York, Saturday\u2019s gone. So I started a limp -- you know, during the -- I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with the parade, it\u2019s so funny. When you go in front of the review stand and the guy say, eyes right, so everybody start eyes right, and you do too, I start limping. So I broke the whole cadence, can you imagine? All the guys going the step, I start limping. So the viewing general told the camp commander, so he said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s kid is sick, why you make him march?\u201d So he talked to my first sergeant. He said, \u201cOkay, sir, I will fix it up, I\u2019m not going to let him march no more.\u201d I was out. You know?"

Because when most of Jews who were dead, Hungarian were still in Budapest til 1945. So they come on too late. It is true they paid a dear price, because Hitler had to get rid of them very fast. Now, the other Jews, if they young and strong, they had a chance to work in the camp, or some labor. But Hungarian Jews, he was trying to kill them fast as he can because Hitler was running out of time. But when those Hungarian Jews who didn\u2019t go to the camp was pick up by the Holocaust -- Holocaust, and explained the horror of it, and didn\u2019t experience it, they are hypocrite.

But that\u2019s a different chapter, because they were never -- they never any -- any idea. But I would never be presumptuous enough to explain the horror of the camp, because I were not there. 4"

I wouldn\u2019t say more than 15 percent was in group like me, working or learning -- but not big enterprise, some more, some less. Some of them immensely successful. But what I\u2019m trying to bring a point about the welfare. We all went to the school from first day we arrive, to learn English, working at nighttime. I restrain from any group coming in the United States want to change the system, or improve the different language in our educational system. I don\u2019t care from what country you come.

I don\u2019t care what work they performed. They were very, very successful what they were doing. 7 Never on welfare. I don\u2019t know a single Jewish in Kansas City that\u2019s went on welfare. They accepted from Jewish community to get started only, but every one of them was very anxious to go on. I don\u2019t know anybody who did not send their kids to college. I never see -- every si -- every one of our friends, the kids have. And some of them from prestigious universities. So it is something in willingness to work. Jews are not lazy people.
