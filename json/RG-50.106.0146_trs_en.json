You\u2122re writing three letters to me? Do you think we have nothing better to do than that? I feel like sending you to a concentration camp. And -- and then he said a few more words I forgot, and then he let me go. But I d -- I didn\u2122t know whether it was okayed or not. About five days later I got the paper and -- and he -- I had asked for. Interview with F red Goldman November 19, 2001 28It was sent to me by mail.
