The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. Could you just start by saying your name a nd where we are today?",
            "answer": "Yeah, yes, okay. It\u2122s -- My name is Adam Starkopf. I was born, raised, and educated in Warsaw, Poland, also the capital of Poland. And my parents -- I had one brother, four years older. I was born in 1914, he was born in 1910. My parent were -- not because I am their s -- their son, but th-the most wonderful people, but my mother was not very well in the last years before the war, didn\u2122t feel good in general, had high blood pressure, you know. We used to think that she\u2122 s a very old women, in those days she was only 54, or 53, you know, at the -- in the war. Anyway, I was married after graduating Warsaw University. I was 22 years old when I was married, in 1936. My wife was [indecipherable] Warsaw University [indecipherable] she wa -- she was my age. And so, you can imagine we were married in 1936. Actually now, May 31st would be 63 years. My wife died March eight. Now, when the war broke out, Se ptember first, 1939, and the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 3 Germans, you know, Nazi Germany attacked Po land, they were bombing Poland day and night. I was that time 25 years old already, and my wife, because we were married three years before the war, in 1936. And actua lly, it was such a sudden war, you know, they called it a blitzkrieg, you know, that\u2122s [indeci pherable] nobody expected it. And there I was expected, you know, I was expecting to be recruited into the army. Now, unfortunately, the Polish government, the army, they didn\u2122t have not only enough uniforms to -- for recruiting young people with military age, but they also didn\u2122t have even -- they didn\u2122t have any arms, and few days after the war started, in the beginning of September, the Polish government, including th e president, escaped to Romania, was neighboring -- neighboring with Polan-Poland. But, on September -- September the fourth, over the radios, there were announcements that all military age men should leave Warsaw, and recruit in a certain city near the Russian border, in the eastern par -- eastern part of Poland. And it was about 120 miles away from Warsaw, and we should walk, you know, and report there [indecipherable]. Now, we were day and na -- na -- two nights were discussing this with, you know, my -- my in-laws, and my parents, and my -- now wa -- a-and we decided, you know, with my nayb -- our neighbors Warsaw, and we decided that I -- I said, \ufb01I have to fight them. Wi -- I have to leave.\ufb02 And I -- September the sixth, 1939, six day after the war started, I left at five o\u2122clock in the morning, my wife, my mother prepared me few things to take with me only, you know, to carry. And I left ate -- they walk with me to the -- to the end of, you know, the near -- actually walk USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 4 over with me, you know, all the way up to the -- we have a river [indecipherable] divided at -- suburb of Warsaw. So they walk with me up to that suburb, you see? And then -- And then I just embraced them, and sa -- my wife was crying, my -- my wife was crying, my mother tried to feel -- make her feel bette r, tried to smile, you know, he will be okay. And they walk away. And when I looked back after them, I saw how my wife, you know, gently taking [indecipherable] bracing my wife , and walking away. Now, what can I tell you? The walking was undescribable, the ma rching to the highways. They were bombing -- the planes were over our heads, almost. And so far the not -- even from machine guns, they were, you know, sh-shooting to the -- there was a lot of people, you know, thou -- hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of people, and -- and some vans with ho-horses. Anyway, we were running away from the highways into the field houses, you know, trying to escape from it. It took us over nine da ys to walk this 115 - 117 miles, can you imagine? Now I, not far already from theles city, I was wounded. A piece of shrapnel from one of the bombs hit my f -- right foot. And in the field, you know, there was some, you know pe -- pe -- not ambulances, but there was some still f -- y-you know, army pl -- da -- vents, and so on. Anyway, they cut off in the -- without anesthetic, my toe had to be chopped off in my right foot, and I had only four toes, and that hole, like, you know, in my foot -- in the right foot."

            "answer": "The -- The se -- The second toe, like this. The second from the -- the right toe from the -- from the large toe, the second toe. But it didn\u2122t mean a thing to me, you know, and I just -- I was pretty strong to -- to take it, and we walked farther, and we came to a city of Kleck, K-l-e-c-k-, and this city was very close to the Russian border. And the first night, we were sleeping in a very clean barn. It was the -- really the first night that we peacefully could sleep, of course, in our clothes, you know, torn clothes, whatever it was. Well, you know they -- when they cut off my toe, you know, they took a piece of my shirt, you know, cut off for band -- to bandage it. And then we -- So -- But when we sleep in there, we woke up at five o\u2122clock in the morning. We heard some noises outside, you know, tanks coming, trucks, and so on. We ran out, the Russian army was coming in. Now, I want you also to mention that some of the boys that left from our building, my age, some were much younger even, together with me, some of them went back. They couldn\u2122t -- you know, they just said -- decide d no, we will not make it. And because a lot of the -- were killed people too, you know, on the highways. So they said we -- they -- we\u2122ll go back, and they left us. And the -- I went with just few that I knew. Anyway -- And this was the Russian army. You -- You know about the problems that in -- in that time actually. I thought it [indecipherable] when I saw the Russian, you know, th-the -- the Russian trucks and tanks, I was happy, first I thought they come as our allies. But then I found out that they are allies of Germany, and they divided to this -- to this -- to -- they decided with -- you know Stalin and Hitler signed a non-aggression pact, you see. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 6 And what they did, they divided Poland in to two zones. The western part of Poland occupied by Germany, and th e eastern part of Poland was occupied by -- by Russia, Soviet Russia."

            "question": "But you didn\u2122t know about the pact between Hitler and Stalin before this, huh?",
            "answer": "Before I didn\u2122t know nothing, but I found out there. Yeah -- No, before I nothing -- it\u2122s never [indecipherable] to the country, I thought that it will be now close to the Russian border, even if we\u2122ll not be recruited, at least we\u2122ll be safer there. Anyway, I, as a young boy I remember it even that onc e you are under Russian occupation, or something, it\u2122s not easy to get away from this country. So, I was scared that I will not be able to see my family again, so I decided to escape from there. And I perf -- I met a Polish peasant, you know, who had the rowboat, because the divided -- now, the division between -- th-the border between the eastern and -- and the -- and the western part of Poland, was the river Bug, B-u-g. Bouk, we pronounce it in Polish, and -- you see. So anyway, I decided to escape, I -- I didn\u2122t have money enough, I gave him my watch -- to the peasant, and for this he took me in a rowboat over the river, and we somehow were able to omit, you know, the border patrols, the Russian and German border patrol, and I took a train back to Warsaw. And when I arrive in Warsaw, I can tell you one thing, I was just amazed, because I -- I hardly could -- could recognize it, you know, some building, they\u2122re so completely you know already, yo u know [indecipherable] and in German, cars and trucks and Germans, all over, all ove r everywhere. I was running towards our USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 7 building and it -- it\u2122s a miracle how our building was not destroyed, in one piece, and I met the janitor of our building. It was a four story building. In those days, you know, in Poland, not like here, you know sky -- you know sky rise buildings, this -- the -- the tall rise building was seven story building. And anyway, I met the janitor, ask him how -- in the -- right at the gate, \ufb01Tell me, how -- ho w is my family, how\ufb02-- \ufb01Oh, everybody ex-except your mother, your mother is dead.\ufb02 I was shocked, and I run upstairs, you know, we had no elevator, you know run upstairs to the third floor, open the door, you could see my wife, my parents, and my in-laws, were very happy to -- to see me, and crying, told me what happened. You see, during the bombing of Warsaw, everyone was instructed to run into -- you know, the build ings had cellars, you see? So everybody was running down into the cellars to avoid the bombs, you see?, and she was there, my mother, one night when they were bombing Warsaw. And some of the boys that left with us, and came back, they were say -- telling people that oh, we\u2122re so glad that we came back because none of the others, probably, is alive. And my mother turned in to my wife, and my father, and said, \ufb01Oh my God, if Adam is not alive, I will not live.\ufb02 And she got a stroke, right there. She got high -- very high blood pressure, you know, yungbe -- even before the war. And she got right there, in the -- and that\u2122s how I found out that she died. Now, I also didn\u2122t mention my -- to you -- my wife had parents, father and mother, and a brother. The brother was only 19 years old, grad uated Warsaw. He graduated Hebrew high USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 8 school, you know, and just was going the firs t year to the university. Very bright, very nice, handsome boy. Now, what my wife did, you see --"

It was -- I\u2122m sorry, it was December, and you know -- 1939, and th-the snow was up to our knees. But anyway, we walked all the time through, and we came back to Warsaw. And then, of course, we told my in-laws and my father, that he is probably on the way to Palestine. And even -- They never, until the day that they went to the concentration camp, they never knew that he is -- you know, that he is dead. Now -- And then, we\u2122re supposed to settle, you know, whatever it was, you know, to settle down, you know, under the conditions there were in Warsaw. But, in 1940 -- this was -- I -- s -- I told you there was [indecipherable] 1939. In 1940, Hitler decided in order to lift -- li -- see, they used to have the conferences in Germany, I understood -- I found out, and they decided to annihilate all the Jews from the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 16 wer -- western Europe. Now, you know that to have a very easy access to those people, he had to concentrate it, you see, in certain s pots. So, he established ghettos, and in s -- in Warsaw, which was the capital of Poland, was the largest ghetto. Now, what he did, you see, he took wat section of Warsaw, and an y person -- and ki -- family that was not Jewish, they were forced to move out from there, but they we re allowed to take all their belongings, everything. Now, Jewish people that lived out of that section, were forced to get into that ghetto section, but they were not allowed to carry nothing with them, just the way they were standing. And we were forced, those people that happened to live in that ar-area, like -- like we, and my in-laws, everyone was forced to take several people into the apartments. Like, let\u2122s say i -- on the average apartment was two bedroom apartment, one bedroom apartment, they had to have at least six more people, seven people, to take everybody. There were rations, one and a kilogra -- one and a half kilogram of bread every [indecipherable] day, and so on, fo r a family, and it was terrible. Now, what happened, they built a wall between 10 - 11 feet high w -- brick walls around the ghetto, and on top of the wall there were barb wires, you know, cemented into the top of the wall, of the brick wall, so people couldn\u2122 t jump over it, you kn ow. And there were ghettos, there were several ghettos -- several gates in the ghetto, and they were guarded by the Gestapo, which is the -- the Nazi military police. Now, we -- what I was doing, try just to help my father, my in-laws, and my wife, I looked like a typical Polish guy when I was young. I was blonde, you know, blue ey e. I looked like a very good Polish boy. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 17 Yeah, there was an ordinance that time, in -- in Warsaw, that every Jewish person has to wear a white arm band, on his right arm, with a Jewish star of David, from material, you know, piece of material. Anyone that caught without it, would be shot right away, or imprisoned. Now, what I was doing, I had so me connections with the i -- with some Polish friends on the other side of Warsaw ghe tto, so I was -- I got a spot in one of the -- spot far away from the -- from the gates. You see, I was pulling out -- I broke some few bricks, taking off my arm band, I smuggled out myself into the other side, where I could bring a little bit some better nourishment for my family. Then, in 1940, in May, my wife walk over to me, crying. \ufb01Adam, you will not believe me, I am pregnant.\ufb02 Now, I have to mention to you -- you -- you know -- you know, I\u2122m told you before, we\u2122re married three years before the war, and like more parents, you know, her parents, my parents were dreaming about a grandchild, but we were told that my wife can never have children. Some -- You know, some woman that -- she can never have children. The doctors were -- to-told us, many doctors. Because for three year -- three years before the war -- it was already almost three and a half years, you know, and there I would never bring a child, with my wife, into a world like this. But, knowing that she never can have children, you know, that is different story. So, anyway, we decided we wanted to have abortion. We want to do something not to bring the child, but in those days you listened to your parents, you know, even if you were married. And my in-laws, and my father said oh no, you have to have a child, and you -- every child has -- anyway, in 1941 in January, my -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 18 the child was born on a table lik e this table, a wooden tabl e, you know? And without a doctor\u2122s help, just a neighbor helped to deliver her. And my wife was very sick also that time, had all kind of other sicknesses, you know.

And I somehow -- what I saw what they were doing to children in ghetto, I p-p-pledged that I would see to it that they wouldn\u2122t put a finger on this child. You know, just I -- I\u2122ll do everything. And then , what started, you know, I was going back and out, you know, for the child also bring a little milk, or something, to feed her, you know, and -- and in -- I was caught by [indecipherable] on the way back, I was caught by the Gestapo, an d I was imprisoned, and you know, the conditions in those prisons that time were terrible, of course. You had to -- Now, not a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 19 single criminal in Warsaw ghetto was in prison. Doctors, lawyers, accountants, you know, business people, but all Jewish people we re in prison. Now, my father met a Polish policeman, of German descent. You see, there were just like in United States, somebody may be American citizen that has grandfather or great-grandfather was German. So, they call it [indecipherable] of German descent. We had this man of German descent, and he found out that he had some connection. He a ll -- called up to him, he said, \ufb01Look, I don\u2122t have any cash, but we have a beautiful bedr oom set in hiding by Polish friends, that we gave the set to our children when they were married. We will give you the bedroom set if you to -- see to it to release me from prison. And he did. But he wo rk out, you know. It was a deal that he -- he -- he -- he knew probably somebody there. Anyway, they release me from the prison, and we -- when I came back, of course how happy they were, but later again, at night, they came and they took me back. Now, what he did, undoubted -- that\u2122s -- that\u2122s the way we -- we assumed they -- I\u2122m sure, he probably told them, \ufb01Look, I can get my bedroom set if you let him out . Later, you ca -- any time you want to, you can get him back.\ufb02 They came at night, at -- at -- at our apartment, knock at the door, and took me back to prison. I was in prison that time, let me tell you this way, 26 men in one cell. You can\u2122t imagine the conditions. In the morning, at five o\u2122clock, the door would open, the two German Gestapo men, with the German Shepherd. When they were pointing a finger at one of the prisoners, s -- and say Juda, which means in German language Jew, the German Shepherd was traine d to jump at this Juda, you know, and to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 20 tear him apart. Every second cell they were like this, every second, they open, you know, and they were killing, like murdering three or four ki -- men, and then later replacing them, so always 26. But then, this was already 1942, and I found a -- i-i -- in -- in -- in June, I found out that they liquidate -- liquidating the Warsaw ghetto. Liquidating it means they are going to take the people into concentration camp. Now, in order to have again access to all those people, they surrounded first old age homes, nursing homes, hospitals, some orphanages, or whatever, you know, they got children in, and also prisoners. Anyone in relatively good health was taken -- loaded into trucks, taken to the cattle cars, -- you know, trains, and taken to the concentration camp, Treblinka concentration camp was -- I call the destructi on camp, was about 80 or 90 miles away from Warsaw. 1,000,000 Jews were ki -- destroyed there. Now, anyone that was -- let\u2122s say children, or teenagers, or people older that were not, you know, in -- in the best health, they were taking to Jewish cemetery, which was outside of the Warsaw ghetto, was too big to be in ghetto, and they were executed there, and thrown into mass graves. The mass graves that time, had approximately 300 - 350 bodies, each grave. And the -- Some of the children were half -- not yet dead after they shoot, you know, or a little breathing, or so, they still were thrown into the graves. Now, when they surrounded the prison, we\u2122re all -- open the doors , wi -- every one of us had to go down to the courtyard, you know, out and loaded -- tol -- they woul d load us into the trucks. And there was tremendous chaos als-also that time, there wa s just hundreds and hundreds, you know, of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 21 the -- anyway, I was able to escape from the prison, together with few other men. We had no prison uniforms, just to -- you know, just old clothes to -- I ran home, you can imagine how my wife, and my parents, and in -laws, how they saw me. My father, [indecipherable] my in-laws, how they saw me, how hap py they were. And I told them, look, what they were doing to children, what I saw, and so on, I -- you are not go -- I -- I am going to do -- work out something. I had connections with some people from the Polish underground. I work out forged documen ts that were Polish people. My wife, the baby and I are Roman Catholics. She also was blonde, looks like Polish. And the -- the -- the ka -- you know, the documents that we had, the forged documents, the stamp, swastika, I took a potato, a regular potato, cut out the pot ato, made a stamp out of it, you know? To make the first -- the swastika pi -- stamp. And that\u2122s was our document. If they would look closely, that -- at it, they proba bly would realize, but you know, ju-just to have it. Anyway, and I arrange an escape, ho w I arrange the escape. Our child was that time -- this was -- we planned everything, afte r everything was organized, I planned, you know, the place, far -- to far -- about seven -- 80 miles away from Warsaws, everything. It took us, you know, close, you know, all t-the June and July. And I plan, on July 31st, 1942, I plan the escape. Now, a friend of mine, a young doctor that was there also wun, he injected her, put her to sleep, the baby. She was about one and a half years old at the time."

My wife -- Men couldn\u2122t do it, men couldn\u2122t be -- wouldn\u2122t be allowed to follow. My wife followed the funeral -- I mean, funeral, it was just a van with the horse, you know, and the horseman, and the -- and -- and the casket on top. She put on a piece of black material, she put on [indecipherable] on her head, and she walk aw -- and she went th rough. When she went -- came to the gate, the Gestapo gate, they wanted she -- they sh -- that they -- the horseman should open the ga -- the casket, to see, maybe some smuggling going on, or something. But my wife said to -- to the man, that she died from typhus fever. You see, in -- in ghetto, because of the conditions, very bad con -- the -- thousands and thousands of people died from typhus fever. So my wife said -- and so here -- wu -- th-those -- those be -- they were like, you know, th-they were very brave with harmless people, with children, with it, but they were scared of -- to death of contagious diseases , so he moved away from it, from the casket, and she went through to the cemetery. The gravediggers wanted to pick up the baby, throw in the mass grave. My wife screamed out, \ufb01She\u2122s alive, don\u2122t touch her.\ufb02 They can\u2122t believe their eyes, they couldn\u2122t believe it. But you see, here again, I thought everything in advance. On Jewish cemeteries, in Pola nd, on Jewi -- only Jewish gravediggers were working. Not others, like here, let\u2122s say or so, you see? So, like here, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 23 when my wife was buried, in Shalom Memorial Park, here in Chicago, you know, in the suburb of Chicago, three months ago, you know, there were not -- not Jewish gravediggers. Now, we got [indecipherable] th ey -- I wasn\u2122t afraid of any betrayal. So they -- anyway, they took out the baby, with my wife, and they too -- put them in a room, where before the war they used to wash the bodies, prepare for regular, you know, burials, you know, normal funerals, and they were waiting for me over there. In the evening, I again, like always, slipped out to the other side, and I went to the cemetery, met her at close to 10 o\u2122clock in the evening, with the baby. Now, with -- you see, the Jewish cemetery had -- they were -- adjoining Polish cemetery, and Tartar cemetery, there were brick walls in between. I made -- work out with the Tartar cemetery -- Tartar cemeter -- cemetery, the caretaker that I will knock at the wall with a stone, and he will drop a stepladder, and we will go on the other side, and we gave him something for it, you know. And would go out, a nd we\u2122ll be on the other -- and then we\u2122ll escape. And I knock at the wall with a stone, he let out the stepladder, went on the other side, and took a streetcar to a place where we slept the first night -- nobody would suspect that we are such, you know, idiots. We slept in a building where -- si -- there was -- the building was, I think, six or seven story, I don\u2122t remembe r, but up to the third floor, there was Gestapo po -- railroad police, above the regular apartments. And we slept there one night. The man that wa -- he was a member of Polish underground, but he didn\u2122t know that we are Jewish, and we slept the first night there. In the morning we took a train, at seven USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 24 o\u2122clock, six o\u2122clock in the morning, a train, and this was -- I prepared a place, about 75 - 80 miles away from Warsaw, where I would -- there was a lumber yard. I would work in the lumber yard as a laborer there, and then, my wife with the baby would be there, I would took a room, and --from a peasant -- p -- the pe -- the Polish peasants, the tiny little room, you know, with the w -- iron stove -- st ove with the pipe, and it -- one bed. Three of us would sleep in the one bed. Now, it\u2122 s a -- it\u2122s a -- a wooden -- you know, s-story -- it\u2122s a one story house, small. Now, I prepared there a very ground -- very deep cellar for my father and my in-laws, they could not be in the open, you know, as Gentile people. So I prepared a -- a spot, a very low do -- very deep cellar. They would be , during the day, in the cellar there, in hiding. At night, we\u2122d take them out, feed them, and they would go back to the cellar. And after three days, I went to get my father and my in-laws. After three days, when I came there, unfortunately, was fire, and most of the buildings were on the fire, I couldn\u2122t get even to our building. And my father and my in-laws were taken away into a concentration camp. So actually, none from our families, both families, nobody alive."

But I would -- if you want to know, there were look tha -- like all over the world, there all kind of people, you see of the same na -- the same nationality even, you know. And [indecipherable] religion, [indecipherable] look, there were some Polish people, there\u2122s -- you see, there was an ordinance, that anyone that is hiding a Jew, if the Ge-Germans will find it, they would be executed together with the Jews, the whole family. There were some, they were risking their lives. There was a pro -- a Dr. Chizevitch in Warsaw. He, in his apartment, broke a wall to other room, and put an artificial wall, they build special artificial wall that wouldn\u2122t recognize it\u2122s another room, you kno w?

Now, yo u can imagine he was in that room in his USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 27 apartment. If they would -- he risking -- he was risking his life, and he was risking you know, th-the -- the whole family\u2122s life. And yet, he did it. And there were many like this. There was one Polish -- a younger man with a wife, they got no children, he was hiding, there was a somew -- not far from Warsaw, in a little town, they was hiding in the attic six people, family, grandmother and so on, six people. But there wa -- th-there was -- it came to a point that already, you know, they run out of money, also, p-pay them to, the wife of this man said, \ufb01Look, no use to risk any more our life, let\u2122s give them up.\ufb02 He took out a gun, he said, \ufb01If you give them up, I kill you, then myself, but I will never give them up.\ufb02 And he saved them.

I told you I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 30 went there to get them, I came back, told my -- I had to tell my wife about it. You can fi -- riz -- realize how she felt about it, but we decided one thing, we\u2122re going to live for no other reason, to save the child. Do everything in our power to save the child, both of us. And we did it, we worked. My wife was goi ng every week to church on Sundays. At night, in the evening, before we\u2122re going to sleep you know, sh e used to, very loud at the wall, pray for the night, so the neighbor, you know, the one that we ri -- renting the room from, she would hear it, you see? And that\u2122s -- nobody would suspect us, you see, that we are Jewish. And, of course, we were raising the child, and we were very, very poor that -- I mean, I was working, I was getting rations in the lumber yard, as a laborer, nothing. But that was -- we were going through all kind of different times, and I also had to watch, you see, very carefully, you know, that shouldn\u2122t sometime recognize, or something like this. There was one -- one boy that was a clerk there, not a laborer like I, was v -- 18 years old. Very delicate, very gentle, good looking, and a blonde boy, and he always [indecipherable] he saw me to -- picking up a big piece of lumber, let\u2122s say, you know, to put away, he said, \ufb01Mr. Podalski,\ufb02 -- I was already in comparison old man, I was in my -- you know, 20\u2122s, he said, \ufb01Let me help you.\ufb02 And I said to my wife many times when I was coming to the -- where I -- walking distance from the lumber yard, I said, \ufb01You know, there is working one boy, I am very suspicious about him, he is too delicate, he is too gentle. He\u2122s ats -- I don\u2122t know, he\u2122s not an average,\ufb02 you know. And I want -- I said, \ufb01I\u2122m going to find out.\ufb02 And I walk over one day to him, I said, \ufb01Look, Wally, how about USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 31 to go with me Sunday to the church?\ufb02 I didn\u2122t go like my wife was going, I didn\u2122t, but you know, I said Sunday to the church. He says, \ufb01Okay, why not?\ufb02 And the church was about three kilometers away from the lumberyard, you have to walk on the highways, and on bo -- on the highway, on both sides of the highway were forests -- woods were. I walked with him, I said to him, \ufb01You know, Wally,\ufb02 -- in Polish, of course, \ufb01what would -- wis t -- what should we do if some Jewish people were hiding in the woods, would run out and attack us?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Mr. Podalski, I don\u2122t think there are any, but if they are, they are happy they will li -- that they are left alone. They\u2122re trying to be in hiding. They wouldn\u2122t torture, they wouldn\u2122t hurt us.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Wally, I am Jewish, how about are you?\ufb02 And he embraced me, he started to cry, the boy. He was Jewish, too. He was [indecipherable]. I wri -- I wrote about him, and that whole story, in my book, you know. So, you know, he was Jewish, too, he was killed later. Anyway, we -- so we had all kind our tol -- our dow -- our daughter while we were there. One day, she devel -- she got sick, she got very high fever, and my wife went with her by train to Warsaw, to the children\u2122s hospital, to check with the doctors. They check her, they said, \ufb01Oh my God, she has tuberculosis.\ufb02 And the only way we could sa ve her would have -- she has a hole in her lung, the left lung. The only way we could help, if you could have gold injections, so we could, you know, cover the -- w ith the gold injections, the -- the hole in the lung, and she would be saved -- you know, got rid of the bi -- tuberculos is. We didn\u2122t -- We couldn\u2122t -- We wouldn\u2122t have a penny, we couldn\u2122t drea m about gold injections. But then we had an USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 32 idea. We had a very close friend, a Greek, Stamatos Kokinikis. He used to have in Warsaw, a factory of Halivah, you know, making . It was business, very good. And I used to -- I was an accountant. My wife gradua ted law school. I -- You know, and I, like a -- you know, like here, you know, accountant si -- let\u2122s say, you know, public, or a peer -- a regular accountant. Anyway, and I was taking care of his books, so my wife went to him. And I -- Later I found out that he was arrested few times even, because he was helping Jewish people. But he had connections with the Italian embassy in Warsaw, because Italy -- Hitler and Mussolini were allies. So he said -- My wife told him about the gold injections. He said, \ufb01Don\u2122t worry, I get it for you.\ufb02 And he got it through the Italian consulate. He got injections and he gave it, he save our child. And when she was in the hospital, his -- he had a maid, a Polish woman, who knew about it. She used to come to the hospital to bring her goo -- you know, so me good food and things, you know, to -- to give the child, you know, the -- well, you kn ow, she a Polish woman, you see, she was doing it for her. So, anyway, and then sh -- when she was later okay, our daughter, and there were times when we -- you know, were s -- were scared all the time, because we still had to watch ourselves and so on, but somehow, you know, we\u2122re through -- the whole t-time, or like this, and nobody could recognize us, you know. But one day, when the -- the Jewish boy was killed, you see, i -- had -- I write a -- i-i-in the book about his family, and how they were -- why they were killed, and so on, but you know, we were scared that they may [indecipherable] because they knew that I was close already, you USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 33 know, always with the boy -- go nice with the boy, and that I was -- his parents were there, living not far. So anyway, I put our daughter in a sanitorium, because you know, to -- altogether that she should be, you know, well taken care of, and so on. And we were watching, and so on, and one day -- and I f -- the -- the Germans trucks surrounded the -- the lumber yard, looking -- I di -- that time I found out, looking for his fa -- the boy\u2122s parents. Now, what I found out -- not for his, but they looking for the more Jews there. What I found out anyway, that his father -- you see, they were from a different city, not from Warsaw, and he -- they were very well-to-do people, very well off, he had a big factory, and so on. But his fath er in the -- they all pretend, three of them also, that they are, you know, Polish. But his fa ther, in order to operate with the peasants, that they -- together he was making -- they were making whiskey, you know, in many -- the some -- in the villages some, you know, home made whiskey, and he was with them. And -- And I understood that -- that something came out that he probably was in there drunk, or something, that they suspe -- you know, that they called the Gestapo, that we think that they are Jewish people. And they came one night there, and they killed him, and th -- th -- the -- the parents. But after this, you know, we were already shaken, we were very scared. So one day, there was a man working in the -- a laborer, but he was working in the room where they had all kind of things there, you know, in the lumberyard, but anyway, a Polish man, and he came over there to our little room that we lived there, and he said, \ufb01You know, I had to get drunk to tell you, because I didn\u2122t have never spoke to you. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0046 34 Somebody here asked whether you are also Jewish. And I wouldn\u2122t like this should happen to you, what happened to the [indeciph erable] -- to the other one.\ufb02 Listen to this. And he said, \ufb01But my wife said to me, \u201aYou see, it\u2122s all your fault, especially that there was that.\u2122\ufb02 She says, \ufb01Y-You trying to, as a Po lish officer, you\u2122re trying to do everything, you know, for the [indecipherable] and th-th-then they call you here, they think that you are Jewish.\ufb02 You know what I mean? She just made it so that -- and he said, \ufb01Oh my God, I am so -- I love you,\ufb02 he said, \ufb01I,\ufb02 -- you know, changed completely. And [indecipherable] but we already scared. And then there was occasion I wrote about in the book, I left the [indecipherable] and got the job in another place on the railroad, you know, and somehow we survived like this, that in 1944, in August, were liberated by the Russian army. And you know that i-i-in \u212241, they started -- they became enemies, you know, Russia and Germany, in 1941. So, for two years they were allies, and later they were enemies. So that\u2122s what it was, and they were liberated that time. And so you go on farther, what you want more?"
