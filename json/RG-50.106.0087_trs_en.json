            "answer": "Yes. My parents were living in Iwonicz, which is a spa in the mountains. My father was a physician, and he and my mother had been married for two years when I was born. They were very happy together, they were looking forward to my birth, and things were pretty idyllic. In 1939, the war broke out in Poland. The Germans invaded Poland, and my father, being a physician, had to join the Polish Army. Before he left for wherever he was going to be sent, he went to say good-bye to his parents, who were living in Lwow. At that time Poland was partitioned, and Lwow was  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And when he tried to get back to us, he was taken as a prisoner of war to Siberia. When he didn't come back, my mother became very worried. But she was a very strong and resourceful woman, and so what she did was she sold everything she could in the little town, because I think we were probably one of the few Jewish families; there may have been one or two others. And she went to Tarnow, and Tarnow was where her mother was living. And so where does a young woman who doesn't have a husband with a small child, go? Back to her own mother, and we lived in Tarnow. And when I did the show interview, I didn't know that we were in a ghetto, but I found some papers of my mother's which said that we were ina ghetto. Part of the time we lived in Tarnow with my grandmother, and then we were taken to the ghetto. And my mother was allowed to go out and work for the Germans. My mother was a pharmacist, but I don't know if that's what she was working as. Iremember when they took my grandmother. I was probably about three years old, I remember when she went. And from my mother's papers I learned that she was concerned that they were going to do another transport with young children. And so because she was able to go out, she had connections, and she found someone who sold her Christian papers, so that we went to a place called Milanowek Potashawol (phonetic). I think it was probably around 1943."

And at times I lived upstairs with my mother, at times I lived in the basement. I was usually drugged when I was put in the basement because it was a dangerous time and my mother had access, I guess, to medication. At times I was allowed to play outside, and my best friend at that time was Wisia, and Wisia was the younger daughter who was nine years older than I, so she was probably 14 or so, give or take, and she was my best friend, and I'm still in contact with Wisia."

People were coming and people were going. It was also the headquarters for the Polish Underground, and there were little eagles on the windows, and when it was safe, they flashed certain colors, and there was a cupboard with a false back. I mean, this was a very exciting place in which to be. But I thought I was Christian. I went to church; my mother never went to church. I never questioned that."

And the Germans were there and everybody hated the Germans, and there were secrets, but in those days, unlike now, children didn't question. Ifthe parents said this is what's going to happen, that was it. Sometimes my mother would go away for days at a time, and I never questioned. If I asked Wisia, she would say I think your mother's working in a different town, or the Germans are looking for people, and she was hiding, or whatever.

You know, if you had food, you shared it with other people; if they had food, they shared it with you. I remember being hungry. There wasn't always enough food, but we grew vegetables, and we had milk that was brought in, and we did the best we could. But everybody shared, and it was war, and there were bombs falling. There was very little meat, because all the  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

            "answer": "Oh, absolutely, absolutely. And there were times when my mother would put me to bed and she would tie up my throat, and she would put carbolic acid around, because the Germans -- that was a smell that you used in hospitals, that was a smell that you used to disinfect. And they would come and she would say krank, meaning sick, and she said we'll pretend that you're sick. Period. And if they asked me questions about my father, I knew my father was in Siberia, and that was a positive thing, because obviously if he were in Siberia, he was pro-German, and we were, you know, just a good Christian family whose father had been taken away by the Russians. Then after the war ended, and the Russians came in to liberate us, then my mother said now we can't tell the Russians that Daddy is in Siberia."

            "answer": "Oh, yes, because the bombs were falling, and for years afterwards when I saw planes, I would expect bombs to come. Even when I was -- you know, after we had left Poland, I was very, very scared of bombs and the noise and planes going over, because that's what planes did in Poland during the war, they dropped bombs."

            "answer": "Sometimes, also sometimes when they were looking for Jews, and my mother looked very Jewish. I guess I didn't, although when I talked to Wisia when I did the show interview, she told me that one of the things she was supposed to do was to keep me dirty, and so when I played outside with all the children, I was always covered with mud because I wasn't blond, and everybody else was blond. And that was fun, too. I mean, imagine being a little kid and your big sister puts mud on you and your mother doesn't say anything about it, everybody thinks it's cool.

And I remember when the Germans were leaving as the Russians were coming, and everybody was cheering because they were leaving. And there had been some German children in the neighborhood that were pretty nasty, and they were fleeing with their families, and that was kind of nice, too, because they were doing what we had been doing, and now we were sort of on top and they weren't.

Yes, there's -- we come on different days, so I don't really know them, but there's a woman who translates French, and there's another woman who translates Polish, and she goes to the Linthicum, which is the warehouse for the collections department where we have a lot of the artifacts there, too, and she translates. She just doesn't like to come downtown, so she prefers to go to Linthicum."

We play bridge with the same six couples for 25 years, we play duplicate bridge, we meet at each other's homes, and we're sort of a tight group. And then I have friends from my early days, from college, and a lot of my sorority sisters are living in this area. And in fact it's kind of cute, but one of the young women in the collections department is a sorority sister, you know, 30 years apart, but still we laugh about it that we were in sorority together."

            "answer": "Well, I'm very -- I'm Jewish. I'm Jewish. I get -- I still get a fuzzy, nice fuzzy feeling when I go into a church, and I've gone to weddings and I'm very comfortable in a Catholic church. But I'm Jewish and my children are Jewish and my son-in-law is Jewish. When my daughter was married, I had no family at the wedding, obviously, so I really maintain my husband's family. He comes from a very large family with lots of cousins and aunts and uncles, and I maintain that relationship. And my daughter's in-laws are really fantastic people. Their name's Herskowitz, and they've sorted of adopted me so I feel like I do have a family, which is very important. And I wonder what would have happened if there had been no war and if I had lived in my cocoon in Poland. My parents came from well-to-do families. We had lots of servants. We had, you know, everything that we could desire, and we lost everything."

Probably would have traveled, probably would have gone skiing in Switzerland or whatever, and I wouldn't have had these experiences, so I guess everything happens for a reason. But my mother was a very strong woman, obviously, because she saved us, and my mother always said if you have something, 1f you have money or whatever, you need to spend it, because if you don't, the devil comes and takes it. So you really need to enjoy if you have things.  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

That's very important because it's family, you know, it's more than just observing a holiday, it's family. You don't have to go to synagogue, you can just feel it in your heart."

            "answer": "I didn't -- you know, I didn't even think about it. Having children was such a special miraculous kind of a thing, and watching them grow and do all the things, and taking pictures of them and just enjoying everything they did. I did -- you know, I didn't really compare. You know, they went to Hebrew school and they had Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, and they grew up to be nice people. That's the most important thing. The past is sort of a prelude to the future, I guess. You can't dwell on it because you can't undo it, you can't do anything about it. I think it's made me a stronger person, but if I could change it, I would have rather not had that kind of a past."
