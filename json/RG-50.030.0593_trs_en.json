I-I think even my grandparents, my paternal grandparents, who were Jewish, I don\u2019t think they practiced their religion either, which was not unusual for a lot of German Jews. But I did go to Sunday school. I went to German Lutheran Sunday school, and I think I just, you know, went once a week and it was just part of my growing up, I guess. And then when I came to the United States in 1940, I became a member of the congregational church, which apparently is not too dissimilar from the German Lutheran church."

            "question": "Okay. So, did you experience any anti-Semitism when you were growing up?",
            "answer": "Not really. It seems that Stuttgart was rather late in having anti-Semitism visible. I did know that \u2014 I think in 1938 perhaps, I was no longer allowed to go to Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Erica Kanter \u00b0 October 15, 2010 the swimming pool. But I stayed in school, I think until early in 1939. However, in 1938, my father lost his medical license, and on Kristallnacht he was arrested and he was sent to Dachau. Now, in those days, apparently, you could still get out after a fo \u2014 short period. And he was there for a month, and the requirements for leaving at that time, as far as I know, were that you had already applied for a visa to leave Germany, and that you had served in the German army in World War I. And my father was in the German army as a medic in World War I, but he was sent to Dachau. And then, we\u2019re not a hundred percent sure if the story is true, but I was told that the police chief in Stuttgart had a six year old son, and my father was the family doctor, and they say that my father saved the child\u2019s life. And that when this police chief heard that my father was in Dachau, and had already applied for a visa and had served in the army in World War I, he also helped him. So my father got out of Dachau after a month, after he had to have surgery which was caused by his stay in Dachau, where they ruined his sinuses. He left through Switzerland and then went to England. And he came to England in September of 1939. My brother, my sister and I were sent to England in, I think April of 1939, on the Kindertransport."

Do you remember anything else happening at \u2014 you know, your father losing his practice, but I mean, did children treat you differently at school?",
            "answer": "No, no. No one treated me differently while I was still in school. My teacher didn\u2019t, my friends didn\u2019t. So it really didn\u2019t affect me too much. And I was probably doing something very silly, I\u2014 my mother did let me have English lessons for a short while.

And they had twin daughters who were about six months older than I, Joyce and Kathleen. And the day that I arrived, and we went to Marple, my English family had a high tea in my honor. And I was very surprised, because I thought my foster mother spoke fluent German, I thought this is very easy to understand. And then when it was bedtime, the woman I thought was my foster mother disappeared. Turns out that my foster parents had invited the German teacher from the high school to come for the day and make my transition less traumatic. But from then on, I was on my own. But they were wonderful. And I am still in touch with them, and in 2008 I went to England for the twins 80\" birthday.

            "answer": "Well, the one that I remember \u2014 and at \u2014 at this time, you could still write to Germany from England. My English foster mother always gave me tea, like everyone else in the family, but I refused to have milk in it, and she thought that that might not be good for me, so she wrote to my mother and asked whether it was all right for me to have tea without milk in it. And my mother said, oh yes, she has tea at home all the time. Well, what my mother didn\u2019t realize is that English tea is very strong and very dark, whereas in Germany tea is fairly weak. And so my mother said no, it\u2019s fine. So I learned to drink English tea, but was not very fond of it. And I wasn\u2019t too fond of mutton either, although I did like Shepherd\u2019s pie, which is ground mutton with mashed potatoes and gravy."

I think they were probably a year ahead of me in school. And I remember loving my school.

And then a year later he passed the medical exam and then he moved to Massachusetts with us. And the reason we went to Massachusetts is there were very few states where you could practice medicine without being a citizen, and Massachusetts was one of them. So we moved to Braintree, Massachusetts, which is just outside Boston, and he started his practice again, and after a beginning struggle, he became very successful and eventually taught at Tufts Medical School, and put all three of us through college."

My mother, when she was still able to send me packages from Germany had sent me a box of cherries from our Bing cherry tree Interview with Erica Kanter \" October 15, 2010 in Stuttgart. And one night we were to take a bath, and it was my turn to take a bath first. And the bathroom was quite chilly, but there was a nice little cabinet or closet where the hot water heater was, and it was quite warm in there, and you usually dried yourself in there. And I was in there drying myself when I heard one of the twins come up for her bath. And I thought that it was Kathleen, who was the very outgoing twin, and I thought, now wouldn\u2019t it be fun to close the cabinet door and then open it and suddenly say boo. Well, I had made a mistake and it was not Kathleen, it was Joyce, who was a little more nervous. And of course, she cried and shrieked and Uncle Cornish(ph), my foster father, sent me to my room for what I considered just fun, but apparently he was concerned because one of the twins was crying. So I remember sitting on my bed on my beautiful new quilt, opening my box of cherries, and I ate every cherry one by one and I kept muttering to myself, and you won\u2019t have any, I will eat them all by myself. And then in 1980, when I went back to England for my foster mother\u2019s 80\" birthday, I told him the story and he couldn\u2019t remember it at all. But that\u2019s about the only traumatic experience I had. And the only other one was in New York, when I was in school for a few weeks. I remember standing up at my desk to answer a question, and the little boy behind me was measuring the length of my dress with a ruler. And apparently my German dresses had gotten a little short as I got a year Interview with Erica Kanter October 15, 2010 older, and I remember him measuring the length of my skirt.

And the only thing \u2014 you asked whether my parents were able to save anything. The only thing that they were able to save \u2014 and this is a\u2014 a rather unique story, a good friend of theirs was Emma Goering, who was a distant cousin of Goering\u2019s, who was, of course, one of the biggest Nazis. She was very anti-Nazi, and very outspoken, but they never arrested her or bothered here, I guess because she was related to him. But she was a good friend of my parents. And when my mother was getting everything ready, Interview with Erica Kanter \u00b0 October 15, 2010 packed to go to the United States, you were not supposed to take any jewelry or silver, you had to declare that and give it to the government. Well, my mother didn't want to do that. And Emma Goering suggested that she \u2014 my mother give it to her and she would bury it in her garden, in a box, which she did. And during the war, my brother was in the army for four years, and toward the end he was on a leave, and he went to visit Emma Goering, to see if she was still al-alive. And Emma Goering said to him, I have something that belongs to your mother. And they went into her garden, dug up the box, and because he was already a US. citizen and a serviceman, he was allowed to send it to the United States. So my mother got back all of the jewelry that she had inherited from her grandmother and great-grandmother, her German silverware. And then several years later Emma Goering visited my husband and me in New York City, and she was a charming, charming lady.

My uncle, who was an entomologist, left Germany in 1933, went first to Palestine for a few years, then to Venezuela, and eventually ended up in Mexico City, where he became a professor at University of Mexico, as an entomologist. My aunt, whose husband had factories that manufactured felt for printing in both Germany and Italy, left in 1936 and moved to Italy, and a farmer hid him as a farm helper during the war. And my aunt and my three cousins were saved by Italian nuns, who took them to a nunnery. So anyway, these are pictures of my father, and these are pictures of my mother in her childhood."
