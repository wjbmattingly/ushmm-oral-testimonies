The first German request from the hospital for so many people, he had a separate section for syphilitics. So, you don\u2122t play God, but you try to do something. So the first German request got the syphilitics."

The Germans didn\u2122t know that they were syphilitics, but they -- that\u2122s what Germans received, syphilitics. And that was his idea all the time, to save whatever he can. He believed, which was really very strange, he told to teach the ch ildren Hebrew. And the population was aghast, what for? What do they need the Hebrew for, they\u2122re going to die. So he said, they may die, and they may survive. If they survive, where do you think th ey\u2122ll want to stay, in Vilnius? It\u2122s -- it\u2122s -- that\u2122s you -- you know, place of their families? They\u2122ll want to go to Israel. They should stop talking in Jewish, they should learn Hebrew, so if a day comes and God willing they are s -- living, they can integrate themselves into the Israeli society. See, he had different ideas from the others. He discussed with the rabbinical committ ee in -- in ghetto, about how he is doing it. Because naturally they say you cannot play God. But he told them, look, I am giving, for example, 20 li -- li -- documents for life for th e hospital doctors. And I don\u2122t know these doctors 79 in person, they were all Polish doctors. I lined them up in line and I tell the youngest ones, which in my opinion, by face and by the physique, look the youngest ones, I tell the 20 come forward. So he says to my mother, how would you thi nk, Elenka? Should I sa ve a young doctor who may survive and have children, or should I pick out a famous professor who is 80 years old? Now what would you do in my place? And you know, I was right there during the conversation. Mama said, you know, I -- I cannot tell you how to be have. But it\u2122s very difficult for my father to pick out who lives, who doesn\u2122t live. But in a way, he had his opinion about it, that the strongest will survive, whether survive in ghetto or whether later on in the forest, but you have to give them a chance. Now, what chance can you give an 80 year old professor? See, that was how he was -- how he would [inaudible]"

There was no hatred such in Lithuania per se, there was no hatred. We receive d our independence from the Polish -- from the Russian Tsars regime. Russia is famous. The fi rst pogroms were in Russia. We didn't have a word pogrom in our language per se, we didn\u2122t use that word. We never had pogroms in our country. The Russians were not able to switch that ugly behavior of theirs in our territory. But the seeds probably remained. On one side they lived as neighbors, very well together. Again, please -- I remember that during the Russian Tsar s time, the Jewish people were not allowed to own land. And the reason they all went into busin ess was not because they wanted to be business people, they were not allowed to work the land. So one came with the other. So naturally, if he was, say, a tailor or shoemaker or he was br inging in his drosken kucher, some kind of merchandise to the farmers, that was the only way to survive. So after so many years of Russian occupation, the first one, the Tsaristic occupation, that remains. Now naturally, if you are a poor 84 farmer and you work from four o\u2122clock in the morni ng til late at night, and ri -- next door your Jewish tailor is doing a good business sewing and this and that and he doesn\u2122t have to get up and milk his cows and maybe that brought some kind of a jealousy?

So that \u2122s how he started the administration, and you see, Kaunas and Vilnius had the completely different histories. Kaunas had barbed wire and Germans inside and at the gates. Vilnius had no barbed wire, because everything was boarded up. Vilnius had one Lithuanian policemen. If you\u2122ve seen pict ures of the ghetto gate, there is one police -- little booth where the policemen stood and saluted my father. So he tried to avoid the fate of Kaunas ghetto by having Germans stand at the gate , because Kaunas didn\u2122t have forests. Vilnius had big forests in the vicinity and very many Jewi sh survivors were hiding in those forests. And when finally it was little bit quieter in ghetto, and people weren\u2122t taken constantly to be shot, these people started to come back to ghetto to survive, because it seemed that it\u2122s nice and 90 peaceful. And people didn\u2122t realize that we used to get ration cards only for official number of inhabitants. And the unofficial people had to be fed. And how would you feed unofficial people when it\u2122s not enough for official people? So Viln ius had a completely different situation. Now, through my father\u2122s connection with Lietukis --"

And she was a very sensitive person, nervous tension. And she could predict, in a way, things. And my father was aware of her knowing what is going to happen. In 1939, I believe, there was a reunion of Lithuanian officers in Vilnius. And my father knew that Mama wanted to see a Talmudist in Vilnius, b ecause in Kaunas everybody was speaking, there is a famous Talmudist in Vilnius.

They didn\u2122t say the word Germans, but he described the awful th ings that are going to happen and he told her that in a couple of years after that, she\u2122ll lose her husband. Talmudist had no idea who she is, who my father is, that her hus band is Jewish. Absolutely no idea. He read Talmud.

Telling you\u2122re going to die, telling you\u2122re going to live. That\u2122s easy on a person? They show in those plays, they show a scene, they describe a scene. Father standing at the gate, and the German is letting father, mother in to children. And he sees a family coming with three children and he sees a family coming with one child. And he grabs a kid from the three, throws them into the family with one, hits the father on the shoulder with his stick and yells at him, what do you do? You left your child behind. Well that story is all over the plays, the books and so on. His mind had to work in all directions. If he wouldn\u2122t have noticed that one has one child and the other has three children, the one would go through and they would take another third child from the next. He had to see everything. It\u2122s not so simple. And it\u2122s not so simple to -- to ha ve conversations with the Germans when you have 133 human blood to count. As I told you, they want 5,000, you offer a thousand. They go down to four, you go up to one -- 1500. These are people, these aren\u2122t just marionettes, and you have to deal with it. So I would like those people who have harsh words to try to be in his skin and see how they would like to do it. That\u2122s why I say I couldn\u2122t care less at all, cause I\u2122ve seen my father\u2122s reaction and I\u2122ve seen his tremendous effort to do whatever is possible. And he -- in the certain way the effort worked out, quite a bit survived. Not necessarily -- not necessarily in Vilnius but they survived in Dachau, they survived in Auschwitz. Some survived. So, you know, it\u2122s difficult -- difficult to make a judgment. And now what can people -- they judge harsh -- harsh behavior at the gate. I explained to you the gate. Kaunas had completely different situation. Vilnius had completely different situation. Kaunas didn\u2122t have to feed the people, we had to feed the people. So, you do something to do it. He ha d Polish people around, which he didn\u2122t trust. Kaunas didn\u2122t have it, Kaunas had Lithuanian people. So he had here the Germans on one side and he had untrustworthy Poles on the other side. So h-he\u2122s -- find the gold medium. You were afraid of the Polish population, which was not friendly at all, not friendly at all. He had an agreement with Gestapo. The Jewish person ha d a Polish family, friends. The Jewish person would leave his gold for the Polish family to save for him. And then one day they would agree that the Jewish person somehow will come in th e dark to get some of the gold. And the Polish person would call the Gestapo, and the Jewish person would come i n, and pick up the Jew, here we go to Luki\u0131ks. And that happened time and again, time and again. So Father made the plan. He offered Gestapo 50 - 50. I\u2122ll tell you where the gold is, you take 50, I take 50 percent. No Jew goes to Luki\u0131ks, no Jew is shot in Paneriai. You have your share, I have my share for the ghetto. You had to buy food. Food was at exorbitant prices, you needed money. So you figured, what I\u2122m losing? One way or the other, the Pole wi ll call Gestapo to get the Jew, the gold will go 134 hundred percent to Gestapo. This way at least I\u2122ll have 50 percent for Jewish ghetto. And the treasury in ghetto will not be bare, will have something. Well these people -- these people don\u2122t know it, see? He had to -- it was a Machia velli scheme, but it worked. Everybody was happy. Gestapo was happy, and Jewish treasury was happy."

And we had in each location, a Polish repatriating committee. So repatriating committee would check your Polish ancestry, but then Lithuanian KGB had to stamp it. So it wasn\u2122t so simple. So Mama -- we went to many places in the area of Vilnius, where nobody knew who Mama is. And we tried the Polish committees, to talk to them. They said fine, we\u2122ll do it.

So, I don\u2122t know who was the person to help us, but we went through Polish committee legally, absolutely. Now there was a question of getting Lithuanian exit stamps.

I\u2122ll try to go to the west zone and see if I can get into that camp. Because it was too dangerous. We made through so much, so that suddenly, you know -- and I went to the camp, an d I figured it\u2122s no sense to talk to some employee. The director was American General Ta ylor, not the famous Ta ylor, another General Taylor and asked his -- I asked his secretary that I would like to talk to the director.

I sat in the waiting room, finally he saw me. And you know what, it was nothing to hide. I couldn\u2122t lie. I told him the truth. I told him about my father. I told the Jewish aliyah has do -- supported us as far as Berlin, but now we are stuck. We cannot get Jewish I.D.. So the first reaction he said to me, you know young lady, this all sounds like a fairy tale. I said, it sounds like a fairy tale, but this is truth. Because there was no way out. We were sitting in Soviet zone of occupation. So he said, don\u2122t worry at all. Here are the two stickers. Go and get your mother, get her to the camp and here you go, we\u2122ll transport you through Hanover to American zone and that\u2122s th e end of your problems. Now I come back to the Jewish house. My mother is half alive. The ladies are putting her cold compresses on her head because I didn\u2122t return for so many hours. Mother thought that maybe the-the Russian soldiers got me, or whatever.

I\u2122ll attach you as UNRRA officer to the Australians to travel around that area, the whole French zone of occupation. And then that\u2122ll help you -- open you the doors in Australia. So I talked to my mother, I went to Munich back, and M-Mama said, you know what? Your quota is so far away and we\u2122re sitting so close to Russian zone of occupation, why don\u2122t we go to Australia and that\u2122s it. And then, later on if we decide that we wa nt to go to America, the quota will follow you. And the Estonian girl, she came back, she said no, my fa mily is not interested to go to Australia, we\u2122ll stay in here until our American priority date comes in.
