I know much more -- when my cousin of the -- the Uncle Ephrain\u2019s daughter, when they finally eve -- returned from Vorkuta and when he found his family and when she came to visit me, she knew nothing about Jewish customs or anything.

The Germans didn\u2019t know that they were syphilitics, but they -- that\u2019s what Germans received, syphilitics. And that was his idea all the time, to save whatever he can. He believed, which was really very strange, he told to teach the children Hebrew. And the population was aghast, what for? What do they need the Hebrew for, they\u2019re going to die.

And others -- even if not those particular soldiers, others who took other people away. And some of them robbed them as they were doing it, and pocketed the jewelry and so on.

There was no hatred such in Lithuania per se, there was no hatred. We received our independence from the Polish -- from the Russian Tsars regime. Russia is famous. The first pogroms were in Russia. We didn't have a word pogrom in our language per se, we didn\u2019t use that word. We never had pogroms in our country. The Russians were not able to switch that ugly behavior of theirs in our territory. But the seeds probably remained. On one side they lived as neighbors, very well together. Again, please -- I remember that during the Russian Tsars time, the Jewish people were not allowed to own land. And the reason they all went into business was not because they wanted to be business people, they were not allowed to work the land. So one came with the other. So naturally, if he was, say, a tailor or shoemaker or he was bringing in his drosken kucher, some kind of merchandise to the farmers, that was the only way to survive. So after so many years of Russian occupation, the first one, the Tsaristic occupation, that remains. Now naturally, if you are a poor This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But the opinion in ghetto was awful, look at that. There were not many, I would say no more than 30 people attending, and it was just for the administrative apparatus.

Especially in ghetto conditions. Was a very good symphony orchestra until Luba Levitska was int -- killed. She was a very good singer, and the drama actors were very good.

That\u2019s the influence ended. Oh well, what can you do it? Otherwise, they always conferred, they always discussed. Whatever was going on, they always discussed. Mama was a very intelligent and clever person, and she -- she felt his pain, and she felt his inability to do more than he can do. And for a wife to watch her husband being torn to all sides, it\u2019s very difficult. On one of those awful nights of Oshmena, Mama woke up in the morning, her hands were covered with a -- like a scale, from nervous tension. Both hands were covered. And she was a very sensitive person, nervous tension. And she could predict, in a way, things. And my father was aware of her knowing what 1s going to happen. In 1939, I believe, there was a reunion of Lithuanian officers in Vilnius. And my father knew that Mama wanted to see a Talmudist in Vilnius, because in Kaunas everybody was speaking, there 1s a famous Talmudist in Vilnius.

When he returned from the conference, he had one look at my mother and he said, you didn\u2019t listen to me. You went to see the Talmudist. Now, I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but the Talmudist told my mother everything that happened. They didn\u2019t say the word Germans, but he described the awful things that are going to happen and he told her that in a couple of years after that, she\u2019ll lose her husband. Talmudist had no idea who she 1s, who my father is, that her husband is Jewish. Absolutely no idea. He read Talmud. So when Father returned home from the conference, looked at my mother, he knew right away. And Mother lived with that heavy burden on her chest all these years, from 39 to 43."

The lady was telling me later, said she hasn\u2019t seen a sight like that in her life. Because it was shock plus she finally realized what happened. She didn\u2019t take too much activity in ghetto. First of all, Mama -- I wasn\u2019t afraid, Mama was afraid of the Germans, that can get caught in there. And she would spend time with Grandmother, with Uncle, and we had very many friends in ghetto, so she would visit. But she didn\u2019t take part in any administrative or anything because, as I say, nobody from German part knew that we exist. But she would attend, like I show you the picture, I showed the picture.

So I would like those people who have harsh words to try to be in his skin and see how they would like to do it. That\u2019s why I say I couldn\u2019t care less at all, cause ve seen my father\u2019s reaction and I\u2019ve seen his tremendous effort to do whatever is possible. And he -- in the certain way the effort worked out, quite a bit survived. Not necessarily -- not necessarily in Vilnius but they survived in Dachau, they survived in Auschwitz. Some survived. So, you know, it\u2019s difficult -- difficult to make a judgment. And now what can people -- they judge harsh -- harsh behavior at the gate. I explained to you the gate. Kaunas had completely different situation. Vilnius had completely different situation. Kaunas didn\u2019t have to feed the people, we had to feed the people. So, you do something to do it. He had Polish people around, which he didn\u2019t trust. Kaunas didn\u2019t have it, Kaunas had Lithuanian people. So he had here the Germans on one side and he had untrustworthy Poles on the other side. So h-he\u2019s -- find the gold medium. You were afraid of the Polish population, which was not friendly at all, not friendly at all. He had an agreement with Gestapo. The Jewish person had a Polish family, friends. The Jewish person would leave his gold for the Polish family to save for him. And then one day they would agree that the Jewish person somehow will come in the dark to get some of the gold. And the Polish person would call the Gestapo, and the Jewish person would come in, and pick up the Jew, here we go to Lukiske\u00e9s. And that happened time and again, time and again. So Father made the plan. He offered Gestapo 50 - 50. I'll tell you where the gold is, you take 50, I take 50 percent. No Jew goes to LukiSke\u00e9s, no Jew is shot in Paneriai. You have your share, I have my share for the ghetto. You had to buy food. Food was at exorbitant prices, you needed money. So you figured, what I\u2019m losing?

You stay here. I\u2019ll try to go to the west zone and see if I can get into that camp. Because it was too dangerous. We made through so much, so that suddenly, you know -- and I went to the camp, and I figured it\u2019s no sense to talk to some employee. The director was American General Taylor, not the famous Taylor, another General Taylor and asked his -- I asked his secretary that I would like to talk to the director. And she looked at me, said well, young lady, you can sit and wait. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019Il be able to see you, but at least you can wait. I did wait probably three hours. I sat in the waiting room, finally he saw me. And you know what, it was nothing to hide. I couldn\u2019t lie. I told him the truth. I told him about my father. I told the Jewish alityah has do -- supported us as far as Berlin, but now we are stuck. We cannot get Jewish I.D.. So the first reaction he said to me, you know young lady, this all sounds like a fairy tale. I said, it sounds like a fairy tale, but this 1s truth. Because there was no way out. We were sitting in Soviet zone of occupation. So he said, don\u2019t worry at all. Here are the two stickers. Go and get your mother, get her to the camp and here you go, we\u2019 ll transport you through Hanover to American zone and that\u2019s the end of your problems. Now I come back to the Jewish house. My mother is half alive. The ladies are putting her cold compresses on her head because I didn\u2019t return for so many hours. Mother thought that maybe the-the Russian soldiers got me, or whatever. She is half dead. And I walk in, I says, Mama, don\u2019t say anything. We didn\u2019t have much, I had a rucksack and she had a rucksack, it\u2019s all we had. I said, take your rucksack, get slowly dressed and we\u2019re getting out from here. She said, where to? I said, we\u2019re all set, we\u2019re going to that refugee camp. So, they didn\u2019t see us walk out, you know, somehow you find a moment when people are in another room, we walked out. And we got to the western Berlin and we got into the camp. Naturally the first thing they did was put a DDT behind your clothes, but they gave us food, place to live and everything. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.
