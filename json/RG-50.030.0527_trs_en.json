The Germans didn\u2019t know that they were syphilitics, but they -- that\u2019s what Germans received, syphilitics. And that was his idea all the time, to save whatever he can. He believed, which was really very strange, he told to teach the children Hebrew. And the population was aghast, what for? What do they need the Hebrew for, they\u2019re going to die. So he said, they may die, and they may survive. If they survive, where do you think they\u2019Il want to stay, in Vilnius? It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- that\u2019s you -- you know, place of their families? They\u2019ll want to go to Israel. They should stop talking in Jewish, they should learn Hebrew, so if a day comes and God willing they are s -- living, they can integrate themselves into the Israeli society. See, he had different ideas from the others. He discussed with the rabbinical committee in -- in ghetto, about how he is doing it. Because naturally they say you cannot play God. But he told them, look, I am giving, for example, 20 li -- li -- documents for life for the hospital doctors. And I don\u2019t know these doctors in person, they were all Polish doctors. I lined them up 1n line and I tell the youngest ones, which in my opinion, by face and by the physique, look the youngest ones, I tell the 20 come forward. So he says to my mother, how would you think, Elenka? Should I save a young doctor who may survive and have children, or should I pick out a famous professor who is 80 years old? Now what would you do in my place? And you know, I was right there during the conversation. Mama said, you know, I -- I cannot tell you how to behave. But it\u2019s very difficult for my father to pick out who lives, who doesn\u2019t live. But in a way, he had his opinion about it, that the strongest will survive, whether survive in ghetto or whether later on in the forest, but you have to give them a chance. Now, what chance can you give an 80 year old professor? See, that was how he was -- how he would [inaudible]"

And Panana Simait\u00e9 like us, had a permission to enter ghetto from Major Bourakas, another officer. And he gave her permission to enter ghetto as if she\u2019s studying the Jewish old literature. And we met her in ghetto. She was hiding a group of Jewish people in the attic of Vilnius University library. In summer it wasn\u2019t so bad, but in winter it was awfully cold.

There was no hatred such in Lithuania per se, there was no hatred. We received our independence from the Polish -- from the Russian Tsars regime. Russia is famous. The first pogroms were in Russia. We didn't have a word pogrom in our language per se, we didn\u2019t use that word. We never had pogroms in our country. The Russians were not able to switch that ugly behavior of theirs in our territory. But the seeds probably remained. On one side they lived as neighbors, very well together. Again, please -- I remember that during the Russian Tsars time, the Jewish people were not allowed to own land. And the reason they all went into business was not because they wanted to be business people, they were not allowed to work the land. So one came with the other. So naturally, if he was, say, a tailor or shoemaker or he was bringing in his drosken kucher, some kind of merchandise to the farmers, that was the only way to survive. So after so many years of Russian occupation, the first one, the Tsaristic occupation, that remains. Now naturally, if you are a poor farmer and you work from four o\u2019clock in the morning til late at night, and ri -- next door your Jewish tailor is doing a good business sewing and this and that and he doesn\u2019t have to get up and milk his cows and maybe that brought some kind of a jealousy?

So that\u2019s how he started the administration, and you see, Kaunas and Vilnius had the completely different histories. Kaunas had barbed wire and Germans inside and at the gates. Vilnius had no barbed wire, because everything was boarded up. Vilnius had one Lithuanian policemen. If you\u2019ve seen pictures of the ghetto gate, there is one police -- little booth where the policemen stood and saluted my father. So he tried to avoid the fate of Kaunas ghetto by having Germans stand at the gate, because Kaunas didn\u2019t have forests. Vilnius had big forests in the vicinity and very many Jewish survivors were hiding in those forests. And when finally it was little bit quieter in ghetto, and people weren\u2019t taken constantly to be shot, these people started to come back to ghetto to survive, because it seemed that it\u2019s nice and peaceful. And people didn\u2019t realize that we used to get ration cards only for official number of inhabitants. And the unofficial people had to be fed. And how would you feed unofficial people when it\u2019s not enough for official people? So Vilnius had a completely different situation. Now, through my father\u2019s connection with Lietukis --"

And she was a very sensitive person, nervous tension. And she could predict, in a way, things. And my father was aware of her knowing what 1s going to happen. In 1939, I believe, there was a reunion of Lithuanian officers in Vilnius. And my father knew that Mama wanted to see a Talmudist in Vilnius, because in Kaunas everybody was speaking, there 1s a famous Talmudist in Vilnius. And he told her look, I\u2019m going to the conference, don\u2019t you dare 4 to go and see that Talmudist. Don\u2019t you dare. Cause Father was not one of those people that, you know, believes in this or that. When he returned from the conference, he had one look at my mother and he said, you didn\u2019t listen to me. You went to see the Talmudist. Now, I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but the Talmudist told my mother everything that happened. They didn\u2019t say the word Germans, but he described the awful things that are going to happen and he told her that in a couple of years after that, she\u2019ll lose her husband. Talmudist had no idea who she 1s, who my father is, that her husband is Jewish. Absolutely no idea. He read Talmud.

But he never complained, he never blamed, he just took it in stride, whatever the life was throwing at him. And he had a very easy way not to do it. The Lithuanian officers had the place for him. It was a estate of Pulkanika Skorupskas. Just go and stay there. Nobody would know, that\u2019s why Mama was begging him, don\u2019t get any official place. We have a place for you, we\u2019ll wait until the end of the war, and that\u2019s it.

            "answer": "You want to know my answer? I couldn\u2019t care less. That\u2019s my answer, I couldn\u2019t care less. I would like to have them just sit in his skin and do what he did. Telling you\u2019re going to die, telling you\u2019re going to live. That\u2019s easy on a person? They show in those plays, they show a scene, they describe a scene. Father standing at the gate, and the German is letting father, mother in to children. And he sees a family coming with three children and he sees a family coming with one child. And he grabs a kid from the three, throws them into the family with one, hits the father on the shoulder with his stick and yells at him, what do you do? You left your child behind. Well that story is all over the plays, the books and so on. His mind had to work in all directions. If he wouldn\u2019t have noticed that one has one child and the other has three children, the one would go through and they would take another third child from the next. He had to see everything. It\u2019s not so simple. And it\u2019s not so simple to -- to have conversations with the Germans when you have 3 human blood to count. As I told you, they want 5,000, you offer a thousand. They go down to four, you go up to one -- 1500. These are people, these aren\u2019t just marionettes, and you have to deal with it. So I would like those people who have harsh words to try to be in his skin and see how they would like to do it. That\u2019s why I say I couldn\u2019t care less at all, cause ve seen my father\u2019s reaction and I\u2019ve seen his tremendous effort to do whatever is possible. And he -- in the certain way the effort worked out, quite a bit survived. Not necessarily -- not necessarily in Vilnius but they survived in Dachau, they survived in Auschwitz. Some survived. So, you know, it\u2019s difficult -- difficult to make a judgment. And now what can people -- they judge harsh -- harsh behavior at the gate. I explained to you the gate. Kaunas had completely different situation. Vilnius had completely different situation. Kaunas didn\u2019t have to feed the people, we had to feed the people. So, you do something to do it. He had Polish people around, which he didn\u2019t trust. Kaunas didn\u2019t have it, Kaunas had Lithuanian people. So he had here the Germans on one side and he had untrustworthy Poles on the other side. So h-he\u2019s -- find the gold medium. You were afraid of the Polish population, which was not friendly at all, not friendly at all. He had an agreement with Gestapo. The Jewish person had a Polish family, friends. The Jewish person would leave his gold for the Polish family to save for him. And then one day they would agree that the Jewish person somehow will come in the dark to get some of the gold. And the Polish person would call the Gestapo, and the Jewish person would come in, and pick up the Jew, here we go to Lukiske\u00e9s. And that happened time and again, time and again. So Father made the plan. He offered Gestapo 50 - 50. I'll tell you where the gold is, you take 50, I take 50 percent. No Jew goes to LukiSke\u00e9s, no Jew is shot in Paneriai. You have your share, I have my share for the ghetto. You had to buy food. Food was at exorbitant prices, you needed money. So you figured, what I\u2019m losing? One way or the other, the Pole will call Gestapo to get the Jew, the gold will go 4 hundred percent to Gestapo. This way at least P\u2019ll have 50 percent for Jewish ghetto. And the treasury in ghetto will not be bare, will have something. Well these people -- these people don\u2019t know it, see? He had to -- it was a Machiavelli scheme, but it worked. Everybody was happy. Gestapo was happy, and Jewish treasury was happy."

So you see, things like this, they are not in the books. People who wrote all those articles were happy to have food. And they were happy when they saw Commandant werk -- walking around the street aw -- in a good -- in a mood. They were happy at that time.

I speak Polish perfectly, but I am not Polish and everybody in Kaunas knows who I am. So he said, well, try to think of something. And we had in each location, a Polish repatriating committee. So repatriating committee would check your Polish ancestry, but then Lithuanian KGB had to stamp it. So it wasn\u2019t so simple. So Mama- we went to many places in the area of Vilnius, where nobody knew who Mama is. And we tried the Polish committees, to talk to them. They said fine, we\u2019ll do it. Because Mama had perfect documents from her high school and from work at the Polish refugee committee from the first war. And they said -- another thing was, I spoke perfect Polish. So, no Lithuanians in those years spoke Polish. So she -- he -- she would tell, look at my daughter. We\u2019re Polish people. But they said, what about the Lithuanian? You will not go through the Lithuanian KGB. So Mama came back to Kaunas and said, I don\u2019t know what to do. There is no way to get official papers, and there is no way af-after he unlocks his [indecipherable] and goes to Poland that they will keep me there. So, I don\u2019t know who was the person to help us, but we went through Polish committee legally, absolutely. Now there was a question of getting Lithuanian exit stamps. Somebody took the papers, somebody did the work and somebody got paid. And in our transport were all the workers of Kaunas theater. Ballerinas and drama, everybody was from the theater. At that time my uncle and his wife were still with us, and Mama said Froizim, how about we try the same for you? And he answered, Elenka, there is no way. I am too -- too -- I -- I would show in between those people, I would stand out. I cannot risk. I went through so much, I cannot risk 7 to be caught at the border.

Why did we go to Torun? We went -- when we left Lodz, we went to Torun. During the German occupation, when it was quiet in Vilnius, when they didn\u2019t round up, you know, the young people, I used to take English lessons from a Polish lady. And then you were -- we got very friendly. Her father was a director of a theater in Toruni. And somehow she\u2019s jokingly told -- said, you know, Ada what -- if you ever happen to be in Poland, if you ever happen to be close to Torun, come and stay with us. I used to help them a lot.

We\u2019re sitting with the Feigenbergs already two months. How much longer can we sit? They were very nice to us. In the meantime, they discovered that Mrs. Feigenberg\u2019s deported parents survived Siberia and are on the way back to Poland to join them. So we went to Torun and we started to ask where is the theater. We found the theater and we asked, by any chance is Mr. such and such with the theater? They say sure, he returned back to his regular director of the theater. So we went to see -- to see them and we stayed with them for awhile. See, sometimes, you know --"

I said, do you have anybody from Lithuania, from Vilnius in here? They said no, we don\u2019t. So there was no way to say that I am Gens widow and daughter and so on, per -- they didn\u2019t know anything. So when we 2 came back I said, Mama, you know what? You stay here. I\u2019ll try to go to the west zone and see if I can get into that camp. Because it was too dangerous. We made through so much, so that suddenly, you know -- and I went to the camp, and I figured it\u2019s no sense to talk to some employee. The director was American General Taylor, not the famous Taylor, another General Taylor and asked his -- I asked his secretary that I would like to talk to the director. And she looked at me, said well, young lady, you can sit and wait. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019Il be able to see you, but at least you can wait. I did wait probably three hours. I sat in the waiting room, finally he saw me. And you know what, it was nothing to hide. I couldn\u2019t lie. I told him the truth. I told him about my father. I told the Jewish alityah has do -- supported us as far as Berlin, but now we are stuck. We cannot get Jewish I.D.. So the first reaction he said to me, you know young lady, this all sounds like a fairy tale. I said, it sounds like a fairy tale, but this 1s truth. Because there was no way out. We were sitting in Soviet zone of occupation. So he said, don\u2019t worry at all. Here are the two stickers. Go and get your mother, get her to the camp and here you go, we\u2019 ll transport you through Hanover to American zone and that\u2019s the end of your problems. Now I come back to the Jewish house. My mother is half alive. The ladies are putting her cold compresses on her head because I didn\u2019t return for so many hours. Mother thought that maybe the-the Russian soldiers got me, or whatever. She is half dead. And I walk in, I says, Mama, don\u2019t say anything. We didn\u2019t have much, I had a rucksack and she had a rucksack, it\u2019s all we had. I said, take your rucksack, get slowly dressed and we\u2019re getting out from here. She said, where to? I said, we\u2019re all set, we\u2019re going to that refugee camp. So, they didn\u2019t see us walk out, you know, somehow you find a moment when people are in another room, we walked out. And we got to the western Berlin and we got into the camp. Naturally the first thing they did was put a DDT behind your clothes, but they gave us food, place to live and everything. 3"

Couple of days after, I get another letter. Two days after, I get a cable. So Mama said to me, look, said, she started with 20 marks like you -- we did. She already paid for the cable, she paid for two letters. So get a ticket, go over there, explain to them that you\u2019re not able to take the job, you never worked in your life. And you\u2019ll see the world and you come back. I -- I come over and they -- they tell me the picture. The secretary of communications was expecting a baby in two months. The father of the baby to be was a director of YMCA, Polish nobleman. So now the situation is awful. The lady can\u2019t bend down any more, the rumors that the father is a director of YMCA, they want to get rid of her as soon as possible.

Whatever you can do, do. Whatever you cannot, not. At least stay until we find somebody to fill that place. So that it -- that\u2019s -- that what happened. I started 7 to work, I started to work and then I figured there\u2019s nothing to it. I handled the correspondence. I handed the director his correspondence, I can handle correspondence to the others. I see what has to be done and I accept, you know, instructions from Geneva in -- in English, I sort them out. What\u2019s there a -- what\u2019s there to be afraid? And you know, I started to work, I started to work and very soon I received an army uniform, and I -- I am a lieutenant of the French army, official. So, my girl -- my lady -- my girlfriend who got me, she was always a civilian, so she can say look, you just came. I\u2019m already here several months and I\u2019m a civilian and you\u2019re [indecipherable] army officer. So anyway, I stayed there and one day the director called two of us. He said, look, the Australian military mission is coming to round up refugees for Australia. Talk to your families and see if any one of you 1s interested to go to Australia. Pll attach you as UNRRA officer to the Australians to travel around that area, the whole French zone of occupation. And then that\u2019!l help you -- open you the doors in Australia. So I talked to my mother, I went to Munich back, and M-Mama said, you know what? Your quota is so far away and we\u2019re sitting so close to Russian zone of occupation, why don\u2019t we go to Australia and that\u2019s it. And then, later on if we decide that we want to go to America, the quota will follow you. And the Estonian girl, she came back, she said no, my family is not interested to go to Australia, we\u2019 ll stay in here until our American priority date comes in.
