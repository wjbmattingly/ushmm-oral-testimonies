I was born in Almozd, but we didn\u2019t live in Almozd. We moved from there to Debrecen, which is about the third largest city in Hungary. That was the center for the Protestant section of Hungary, because basically Hungary is a Catholic country. Only the northern part of Hungary was basically Protestant, and their center was in Debrecen and that\u2019s where we lived."

I guess it was just better for the family, you know, more centrally located. I would assume that because the village where we were born, didn\u2019t even have a train come through there. You had to go with a horse and buggy from that town to the train station, which was, you know, about ten klicks (ph), which was about five miles away. So there was absolutely nothing there. It was strictly agriculture, you know, and so my grandparents had some land there and all that. But I would assume that\u2019s the main reason. He still traveled down to all the villages and bought the skins and all that stuff, but basically his warehouse and all that was in the city, and, you know, where they process the stuff. That\u2019s as far as I can remember."

And so it was, I would assume it was considered a public school, but it was a Jewish, ran by the Jewish community. And basically all the children in the school were Jewish kids. But whether it was, you know, sanctioned, whether the Hungarian educational system was part of it or not, I... but it wasn\u2019t religious. It was secular and did basically, read, write, arithmetic, you know, geography, all that other stuff you learn in a normal school. That\u2019s what we learned, but it was basically, all Jewish children went there."

We were already living in Debrecen, so I could not tell you when we actually moved there. I just know that I was born in \u201835 and I know we were in Almozd then, that\u2019s where I was born.

And when we went to the Temple, we prayed in Hebrew. Because it was basically memorized rote, you know. I went to school, separate religious school to learn to read in Hebrew from the Bible.

At the time you just had to wear, you didn\u2019t have to, 1t wasn\u2019t until the Germans came in that they moved us into ghettos. But by then you already had to sew on the yellow stars and all that stuff. And the Christian friends all of a sudden disappeared [laughing]. They didn\u2019t know you anymore. Even if they wanted to probably their parents told them, you know, \u201cStay away from them, don\u2019t play with them,\u201d and such and such. So, yeah. It started actually in \u00b043, but it really didn\u2019t get serious until \u201844, then when the Germans... and that I remember vividly, because it was Passover. We went down to my mother\u2019s parents. We were going to spend Passover with them. And so we all traveled down there. I remember it was Passover night or the night thereafter, I\u2019m not sure which, but the policeman from the village came in from Almozd. He came in and said that all Jews must go back to where they lived. \u201cSo, your daughter,\u201d he told my grandfather, \u201cyour daughter and her children must return immediately to Debrecen.\u201d And so in the middle of the night we had to get a buggy and horses and go back to the train station and catch a train back to Debrecen. From there they told us that we have to move into the ghetto. And so they set aside a square, I don\u2019t know, about two or three square blocks, which they put wooden gates up on each end of the 5 street, blocked it off. And then windows that were looking outside from the ghetto, they bricked them in, so basically you had an enclosed area of so many houses. A couple of streets, basically is what it amounted to. And they herded everybody in there."

            "answer": "Well basically they told us you have so much time to, you know, to gather whatever you could carry, belongings, whatever you could carry and, you know, and move in there. So, we moved in. And they allocated, you know, for each family a room or whatever. I don\u2019t remember now. Space. And stayed there and from there they took the men to work. I don\u2019t know whatever kind of work they were doing. And they would come and take them off in the morning with shovels and stuff and then come back at night. My dad wasn\u2019t there, because he was already taken to labor camp where, they called it... for the Army, basically they were in the service, but they were labor battalions for the Hungarian Army which was already fighting the Russians. And I guess they were digging trenches for them and that kind of stuff. So he was already taken. Back in \u201843 he was already gone. He wasn\u2019t at home. So, he wasn\u2019t there when we were moved into the ghetto, just my mother and us four children."

Basically the Jewish Community was divvying up food, whatever... I really don\u2019t know where the food was coming from. How the allocation went and all that kind of stuff. But we had food to eat, I mean, during that time anyway, we didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t remember being hungry or anything like that.

I was seven and a half years old, eight years old? I\u2019m paying not much attention to that. She used to give me a piece of bread with butter on it, sprinkled with a little sugar. That was my snack. [Laughing.] Tasted good to me. So as far as I know, normal food that she would normally prepare, you know, that\u2019s what we had. I don\u2019t remember... now thinking back at it, I really don\u2019t remember what we ate. What kind of food. But we weren\u2019t there that long, because once they got everybody together, 6 they started cleaning out that place. Load people up and they went to Auschwitz. The only reason I\u2019m sitting here talking to you right now is because the fact that my father was American. He was born in New York City and he never accepted citizenship, Hungarian citizenship. So consequently we were protected by the Swiss Embassy. So they put us in a separate house from the rest of the ghetto. There were some other families there, who were foreign nationals or considered foreign nationals. And they were protected by the Hungarian police and not by the Germans. And so once the whole ghetto got emptied, because we didn\u2019t know where they were taking them. We were taken on train, we were taken to Budapest. And they put us there in a, what they called a protective house. Basically it was a prison, but, and part of the wing there, they even had American flyers there. They were shot down. Because we seen them exercise. We had no direct contact with them. But they were shot down, you know, they were bombing Budapest and the planes were shot down and they got captured. That\u2019s where they kept them, too. So, that\u2019s were they kept us till December 1944."

And so we always had to go down to the shelter. I don\u2019t remember being afraid, to be perfectly honest with you. Sounds crazy, but if I was, I do not remember it as such, as being afraid. I guess at that age, you really... do not comprehend, you know, what was going on. Was no reason, really, in my mind there was no reason to be afraid. But no, I do not remember being afraid.

[Laughing.] There was a place they called Nagy Erd6 which 1s basically a little forest area and they had a big pond there and row boats. And I remember my brother taking me there, you know, for going on the pond with a row boat ride. That kind of stuff I remember. We did things together, I mean we were close family.

So there was, space-wise there wasn\u2019t a whole lot. And we had a window that opened up on the courtyard. But it was all in four with the one gate you could come in or out. It was like enclosed.

December of \u201844, I guess the Russian were getting too close, and then they just moved everybody out in the street. Said, \u201cEverybody out, pick up whatever you can carry.\u201d And this was in December, cold, snow on the ground. And they lined us up in the street and my brother, when he heard that they started hollering \u201cEverybody out\u201d and all that, he ran down underneath to the basement and opened the door for the bomb shelter to the street and he got out there. I followed him. And he told me to go back. I would have been with him, but he didn\u2019t go to the concentration camps. 8 He took off. But he was already fifteen, obviously he couldn\u2019t worry about me. He told me to go back to mom and dad, so I went back and he took off. So he managed to escape. So he did not come with us.

I don\u2019t even know what I was feeling. I really didn\u2019t know what was going... I guess I was just trying to survive. My main motive was, in the cattle car if you don\u2019t watch it you will be trampled to death there. There were people who died in the camp, I mean in the car going there. And I don\u2019t know how long we traveled in the car. But honestly, I really can\u2019t tell you that I actually felt scared, no afraid. Now, I\u2019m not saying that I wasn\u2019t, but I do not remember that kind of feeling. Because maybe that was because of my age, you know, and all that. It just didn\u2019t dawn on me that I\u2019m supposed to be afraid. I don\u2019t know. Matter of fact, my sister tells me and I could not verify it for you, because I don\u2019t know. Because I\u2019m not remembering. But once we were in Ravensbriick, it was like they had appell, basically like reveille in the morning in the Army. Everybody had to fall out of the barracks and line up and had roll call, you know, account for everybody. And whoever was sick had to go, that whole camp was nothing but women and children. Basically women, there were a few children, but not too many. My mother had a real terrible headache and she asked for some medication or something and the German whipped her with... he had one of those riding, you know?"

That tells you I wasn\u2019t afraid for my own personal. I don\u2019t remember doing it, to be honest with you. But that\u2019s what my sister told me that I did. I personally cannot remember that I personally was afraid. From when we arrived at the camp everybody got taking all the clothes and everything away from them. And my mother had sewed gold coins and stuff into each one of our, because we didn\u2019t know, you know, so she divvied up what we had and sewed into our overcoats just 1n case, you know, we could use it. Maybe the whole family could have been saved. My dad got hold of the farmer one of the nights when we stopped overnight and talked to the farmer. And he had sewed in his overcoat, a big diamond ring and he told the farmer he was going to give him the diamond ring if he hides us, the four of us, the four kids and him and my mom. And he agreed, so it must have been a pretty good 11 diamond ring, you know pretty big diamond. But my mom wouldn\u2019t go. She said that he might kill us himself for the rest of the stuff.

They had a cart that you threw it on. Afternoon they walk you back to the camp. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s all. There might have been other stuff, other people picked, maybe because the younger one, the weak and all, the weaker people they took to the easier, where the beets weren\u2019t that heavy.

And at the time my sister, Miriam, she was very sick and they had her in the dispensary over there. So started marching us toward the rail head and I remember Mama hollering, \u201cMiriam, Miriam!\u201d She didn\u2019t want to leave her. [Weeping.] Anyway, they loaded us back up again and my sister stayed behind. From there they took us to Bergen-Belsen. We arrived at Bergen-Belsen and they took us in where the crematorium was and maybe because I was just a little child, but there was a mountain, nothing but dead corpses piled on top of each other. And the smell and everything else, and stayed over there overnight. The next day they took us and put us in the barracks. There was no beds or anything. They had some straw. And give you a sack to fill up with straw. That was your bed. So, basically you laid on concrete in the winter. No food. My mother died there. Then in May, \u201945, we got liberated. The British and Canadian troops actually liberated Bergen-Belsen. And then the Red Cross took us from where they found us, took us to hospital. We stayed there and the Swedish Red Cross took us from there to 12 Sweden. I stayed about a year in hospital. They nursed me back to health.

I guess picking up whoever was still living. Matter of fact they took us to the German hospital. I guess they cleaned it out whoever was in there. Anyway they took it over and that\u2019s where they were taking us. Then they put up big, old hospital tents. That\u2019s where the children, they brought the children to, we were in a hospital, a big hospital tent. I remember that. And I guess they started feeding us slowly, slowly because we had hardly any stomach left. That\u2019s what killed a lot of people, I understand, is they gave them too much food too soon. Got diarrhea and all that, they couldn\u2019t handle it on their bodies. So anyway, wasn\u2019t much left of me by that time. But anyway from there the Swedish Red Cross came and picked up all the children without any family and everything and took us to Sweden.

There was a woman who was a cook there, who was basically supposed to look after me. Look over me. And they enrolled me in a Swedish school, so now I had to learn Swedish. [Laughing.] You know.

As far as I know. I didn\u2019t have the money to pay for it, so they gave me the ticket and I went. I think, basically what they did, I flew from Sweden to France, and in France the Agency picked me up and took me to a DP camp, I guess. And from there they loaded us up on a boat. By that time it wasn\u2019t illegal anymore. The British were gone. And they took us with a boat to Haifa. And we arrived and my brother was waiting on me. We arrived like today and that evening he was already there, my older brother. "

And they just have joint, the milk processing and the equipment, the major equipment and stuff 1s jointly owned, but each one got his own land and his own farm that he works, that\u2019s a Moshav. So anyway, that\u2019s where he took me. The family\u2019s name was Lillieh (ph), they were German Jews, who escaped before, during the Kristallnacht back in \u201839. They got out of Germany and came to Israel. So, they are the ones who, he was with them before, when he first came to Israel. And so anyway that\u2019s the family, and I worked half a day and went to school half a day. So again I had to learn a new language to go to school.

You\u2019re talking about... dunam (ph), I guess, I don\u2019t know how to compare it with acres. But I would say he had no more than maybe fifteen acres of land. And so he had to raise alfalfa to feed the cows. One thing he didn\u2019t have to worry about, 1s that like here you have to cut hay and put it away and all that, so that you would have food for the winter. Over there it grows year-round, semi-tropic, so you don\u2019t have to worry about not having feed for them. You just have to make sure that... but we grew hay, you know, alfalfa for... and cut hay to feed the cows, and all that.

First time I ever, well beside Yad Vashem, you know, when we got interviewed, but that was with both my sisters there and they did most of the talking. And last year, the Jewish Community Center here in Louisville asked me to join them on Yom Ha... Remembrance, Day of Remembrance and all that, to tell my story. So I reluctantly agreed that I would tell them whatever I remember. And so I did. I went up there and said my piece. And that was, beside this here, that\u2019s about the only time. I don\u2019t talk about it. And matter of fact, Professor Dickstein wanted me to go to one of the high schools and speak to the children about my experience and I declined. I said I just can\u2019t handle it. I\u2019m not going to constantly dig it out, dig it up. I just can\u2019t live like that. I\u2019m just not willing to constantly put myself through that.

I just, I think probably the main thing that motivated me on that is I read in places where, especially where they had the trial in Britain about people saying it never happened and all that stuff, 1t\u2019s somebody\u2019s fantasies. And I\u2019m here to tell you that it did happen. And I guess that\u2019s probably the main reason that I agreed to talk about it, is that, you know, people are trying to change history. And if you don\u2019t learn nothing, you don\u2019t learn no lesson from what happened, it can happen again. That was my biggest motivation of joining the US Army, is I felt that the Russians weren\u2019t that much better than the Nazis were. They had the gulags, they had the camps. May not have been prosecuting Jews per se, but they were prosecuting human beings. That\u2019s basically what decided, probably the only force in the world 17 during this period of time that could prevent something like that happening is the U.S. Armed Forces. And so that was my main reasoning for joining the Service. I served in the Israeli Army. I fought in the Sinai Desert in \u201856. And so I\u2019ve been through the wringer. But that wouldn\u2019t affect Israel, doesn\u2019t affect the world. And probably the only force in the world at this time of human history who can make a difference is the United States and the U.S. Armed Forces. So, that was my main motivation of joining the Service."

But I\u2019m wondering about whether you, you were questioning or whether you understood why you and your family and others had been singled out for this, for this horrible persecution. Did you have any understanding of what...?",
            "answer": "Yeah, I understood that it was basically based on my religion, basically that\u2019s the only thing that... you know. And then as I got older and I read. I\u2019m not educated very well. I finished high school GED and I got some college behind me, about sixty-eight credit hours. But basically I read a lot, and my understanding that the foundation for this disaster has been laid a long, long time and is basically... I don\u2019t blame any particular faith, but basically they were teaching in churches and stuff that the Jews killed Jesus and this and that and always had limitation on what Jews can do. They always kept them outside of the mainstream society. And they were prohibited to be in certain trades and they were always prohibited in doing certain things. So they were always kept like foreigners, you know, strangers or foreigners, whatever you want to call them. And then the church teaching basically demonized them. So, I don\u2019t think it was too hard for somebody like Hitler to come along and demagogue the issue to the point where people didn\u2019t, didn\u2019t care. Because it\u2019s supposed to be that most of them were Christians, supposedly supposed to love thy brother and turn the other cheek and all that stuff, they\u2019re teaching. But I guess that wasn\u2019t what, what actually happened. I\u2019ve seen them take a little baby and smash him against, his head against the wall. Kill him. And what human being would do something like that? And then they go to church to pray? I mean, you look back at most of the wars in this world today, most of the time, most of it is based on religion. Take a look right now. Sudan, got a Muslim against the Christians. Northern Ireland, Catholics against the Protestants. You go to India, you got the... Sri Lanka, you got one sect fighting another and again it\u2019s religion. Iraq, Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims. So every place you look at, to me anyway, from what I read and seen, the biggest disaster in this world is religion. That\u2019s my view."

Because I\u2019m not looking at it as religion, okay? I look at it as a homeland for a people. Because you can take the Bible as a religion or you can take the Old Testament as a history of a people. And \u2019'm Jewish and the Bible, the Old Testament to me is the history of my people, and as such every people need a homeland. And that\u2019s what motivated me. But I always consider myself American, which is really funny, that even before the war, my dad always told me that he was American, so I considered myself American. And he was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1906. 18 And he always told me that he is American and one of these days we\u2019re going to go back to the United States.

And they lived here, matter of fact, I got an aunt, who was born here and never left here. She\u2019s passed away now in Houston. But her whole life, she was born in the United States, lived in the United States and passed away in the United States. So, they lived here, I guess in New York and either during the Depression, or early, they decided that they would be better off and went back. That\u2019s my understanding as to what happened. And then my father was still, wasn\u2019t... his sister was old enough that she said no, she\u2019s not going back with them, she\u2019s staying. My father probably wasn\u2019t old enough, you know, to be on his own, so his father took him back with him to Hungary. That\u2019s my understanding, you know, is what happened.

But I didn\u2019t expect that, it was just the way things worked out. I got no complaints personally. If there\u2019s some people that say they were discriminated against, might have been. I have not, my personal, maybe because my brother was already there, you know. He served in the Palmach, which was their elite troops in those days in Israel.

So, they woke me up, and they said \u201cWe need to get out of here.\u201d But they protected me. I mean I got no complaints. I wasn\u2019t afraid. And sure enough, not long after my boss came with a pick-up truck to pick me up and get me out of there. They had some problems, infiltrators. So, anyway. I had my adventures. I helped build the phosphate pools down in the Dead Sea. We built big pools filled up with water and then the sun would evaporate the water and leave the salt. You made a lot of different product out of that. The salt is, they got potassium and they got iodine and they got all kind of stuff in it. They make all kinds of chemicals from that. So I helped build the pools down there for that. I helped build the first highway to Elath.

And then during \u201856, during the Sinai Campaign, the US Embassy came looking for me, they were going to evacuate me. But I was already down in the Sinai, fighting, so, you know. And then they thought that I got killed, so they notified my father that I got killed. I come home and I check back with the Embassy to find out what the status... because I was waiting for a visa. The reason it took me until \u201859 to get to the United States, was because there was no visas. You had to wait. Right now, all this illegal aliens and all this stuff, and everybody says, \u201cWell, poor guys...\u201d Well, that\u2019s not so, because every time you got illegal alien coming in here that means that somebody who is waiting legally, wants to come in, you know, he can\u2019t come in.

So, they increased the number of visas and all that stuff for the Hungarian refugees, and so that\u2019s the reason why about \u201859 I got, managed to get to the United States.

And so anyway, so basically we breached the road and opened it for the armor to get through and we went through. And basically, the Egyptians didn\u2019t want to fight. We found tanks, they were still operational, the engine running, just left them. They just jumped out and ran out barefoot into the desert. Just left their equipment there. So... they\u2019re poor , their officers were partying somewhere and they left them there in the trenches. So anyway, the Egyptian Army in those days anyway, weren\u2019t very strong. And anyway. We lost some people, sure we did. Took a hundred hours for the whole, it took the whole Sinai Desert one hundred hours, that\u2019s all, so. I did my job, whatever I was supposed to have done. I did mine and everybody else. And to understand the Israeli Army you have to realize that they didn\u2019t even have transportation. And guys who missed their units, they hitchhiked to get to their units, to join them. You know, in those days anyway, I don\u2019t know about now, but in those days, people knew their duty and you didn\u2019t have to tell them. They knew what they had to do and it got done. So, it wasn\u2019t like an experience, sure it wasn\u2019t no pleasant experience. I came back, I had a beard [Laughing.]. And when everybody else came back, because Eisenhower forced, you know, the Israelis to withdraw from the Sinai. And since I was in the Engineers, I stayed behind. And what we did, we plowed up all the roads coming back from Sinai, this a-way, and we plowed up all the roads, destroyed all the tracks, train tracks. We took the train tracks, blew them up and all the bridges, anything to slow them down. To slow the Egyptian Army from coming back in. And so we were the last ones out of Sinai. I guess that\u2019s the reason maybe they thought that I was dead, you know. [Laughing.] I didn\u2019t come home. Most everybody was coming home. I was still down there. We were the last ones out.

He served in the Second World War as a flight engineer on one of them Dakota airplanes. He flew mission over the hump in Burma. So, he was a Second World War veteran. He\u2019s passed away now. And my uncle, he served in the Second World War. My aunt\u2019s husband. He was with the CB\u2019s, construction battalion. I arrived in May of \u201859. My dad said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to move down to Florida.\u201d He had a \u201856 Ford, and so we drove down to Florida. We towed a U-Haul thing behind us. And went to work there in... well when I was up in New York I worked for, within a week, I had job, I had work. Work no problem. I have never had problem finding work. I worked for a chemical company, Ephart Fiber and Rubber Company. We were making erasers in a factory. Worked for them and then father said we\u2019re going to move down to Florida. I said, okay. We moved down to Florida, that was toward the end of \u201859, the winter season. He worked as a waiter and I worked as a busboy in a hotel down on the beach. Name of the hotel was Sterling Hotel."

I felt that if 1 wanted to become a citizen of the United States it\u2019s my obligation to serve, you know, I felt, my country. I had no problems with that. So the only problem I really had was, you know, to me, basic training and all that was no big deal. I been through all that. [Laughing.] So, that was no big deal for me. But anyway, language, I wasn\u2019t speaking that well English during those days yet. I had a good friend, went to basic training together, his name was James B. Smith, J.B. He was from North Carolina. And he basically took me under his wings and he was teaching me English. Anytime I was saying something that wasn\u2019t right, he would usually correct me and all that stuff. He was like, Mutt and Jeff? He was tall, skinny guy, you know, and I was short, stocky. And you didn\u2019t have to look far, 1f you seen one of us there the other one wasn\u2019t too far away, was somewhere nearby. So we became really close friends. I\u2019m a godfather to one of his daughters. Even today we still keep in touch. So we really been good friends. That was when I first, you know, got in. The only thing I didn\u2019t like about it, after basic training and advanced individual training. We both were straight leg Infantry and they sent us to Germany. [Laughing.] Sent me right back to Germany, so that\u2019s the only part, that was kind of rough on me, you know. I got over it anyway."

You got everything on post that you would need. So for a long time I didn\u2019t go downtown. After a while I said, well, you know, go downtown and look around, whatever, you know. You can\u2019t lock yourself away. Don\u2019t have to be friends with anybody, but you can\u2019t... and after a while you can\u2019t blame a whole nation for what happened, it just doesn\u2019t make sense. So I mean I don\u2019t love them. [Laughing.] God knows I don\u2019t love them. But I have no particular hate for the Germans. You can\u2019t hate a whole... if you had a specific individual that you knew was... you could hate them. But to me, don\u2019t make no sense to hate a whole nation.

I mean Monday morning, you put your gear on and you marched out to the training area and you trained all week out in the training area. And then you came back Thursday night, sometimes late at night and then you cleaned your weapons and stuff after midnight before you even got to bed. And the next morning you had PT, you had classes, you had this and that and then you had, Saturday morning you had a full field inspection. So you had Saturday afternoon and Sunday, that\u2019s all you had. Then Monday you went back to the field. So, day and a half, I mean you had to ask who wants to go running around? There were a whole lot of other guys who didn\u2019t go a whole lot. Some ran around out to the night, the guesthouses and stuff, looking for German girls and all that kind of stuff. But you know, it wasn\u2019t unusual for guys not to go out. You only had about a day and a half to rest and relax. So, I don\u2019t think it was anything particular."

I mean they didn\u2019t bother me personally, but I heard them talking, you know. I guess some didn\u2019t know I was Jewish initially. Jewish jokes and this and that. But that, it didn\u2019t bother me any, and once they knew who I was, they won\u2019t do it in front of me. Once they knew I was Jewish they did not tell jokes in front of me or anything like that. I don\u2019t know whether out of respect for me or they knew if they did then me and him going to go to Fist City. I don\u2019t know which. [Laughing.] Anyway they did not. So, I personally I really can\u2019t tell, say that... I wasn\u2019t prosecuted or anything. I wasn\u2019t threatened or anything in that sense. Insensitivity? Sure, but, you know, that\u2019s everyday life. Doesn\u2019t bother me any. Once they knew I was Jewish, then I don\u2019t ever, never remember a guy twice telling jokes in front of me. And if he was a buddy of mine, then fine. I got a Jewish joke for you. I says, \u201cThat\u2019s okay, let\u2019s hear it.\u201d But that was friendly banter not out of malicious, you know, hurtful type of thing. So that\u2019s quite different. No, I can\u2019t, honestly can\u2019t say that I was in any way discriminated or treated unfairly or differently because I\u2019m Jewish while I was in the Service. I really, honestly can\u2019t say that. I don\u2019t know maybe I was just fortunate, you know, the units that I was with. Or you know, what I can answer... matter of fact, once I had a Jewish Ist Sergeant. I had a Jewish guy working for me later on when I got up in the grades."

            "answer": "No, that was before me. I mean integration started before I got into the Service. The integration started with Truman during the Korean War. Prior to the Korean War he ordered the Army to integrate its units. Because before you had separate black, separate... but we had a lot of racial problems even when I first got into the Service in the sixties. As a matter of fact, we had a race riot and we had fights, racial fights and that kind of stuff. Because, you know, for me, since I did not, wasn\u2019t raised with black, first time I ever seen blacks was when I got to the United States. I had no prejudice. I wasn\u2019t raised with any kind of preyudice against anybody. So, I basically, as I always, I would take an individual for himself. You know, I rate an individual for the individual. If he deserve respect, he got respect. If I didn\u2019t care for him, whether it\u2019s white, black, whatever, then I didn\u2019t care for him. It wasn\u2019t because of his race. It\u2019s because I didn\u2019t care for his character or his behavior or, you now. That\u2019s the way, you know, it was for me. But when I got in in 1960, you had a Brown Boot Army. I don\u2019t know if you understand what a Brown Boot Army was. But Brown Boot Army, you had... basically, we had, like, our Company, we had a room that was empty. There wasn\u2019t a stitch of furniture, anything, it was an empty room. If you had any problem with anybody, you and him just went into the room and settled your business with your fists. That\u2019s the way things were done. We had a Platoon Sergeant, his name was Cooper. He was half Indian and half Irish. And he was about 64\u201d and weighed about two hundred thirty, somewhere around there. And you messed up and he\u2019d take you into the room there and put you through the woodshed. So he had a very well behaved 26 Platoon. Everybody worked together. You can\u2019t legislate away prejudice. That\u2019s something that you learn at home from your parents, from your society, from your parents, whatever, church, whatever. What you can do with the Army 1s, you force civility. Regardless of whether you like him or not, while you are 1n the unit and while you are in the Army, you treat him the way you expect to be treated. And later on when I became a Platoon Sergeant, whatever, that was my guiding principle. I didn\u2019t care whether... I say, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you like him or not. That\u2019s neither here nor there. You two work together, perform the job, be civil to each other. Once you get to know each other maybe you like him.\u201d You know what I\u2019m saying? That\u2019s all you can expect. You can\u2019t legislate love or you can\u2019t legislate racial prejudice away. That\u2019s silly to even think about it. Just like now, all this silly thing about the gays and all that stuff. I don\u2019t hate gays. Bible says that\u2019s wrong, but I would want to know if anybody in my unit was gay that I had to fight with. I might have to, he might have to give me mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Or I had to go to the shower with him, if I know he is gay I would be uncomfortable. Not a question that I hate him. That question doesn\u2019t make no sense, because in the Service you live so close together, you know? There is no little shower stall where you go in in your privacy. They got one big room with a bunch of shower heads where everybody takes showers. And guys just feel uncomfortable when they know somebody is gay. And that\u2019s the problem, not that anybody has anything against gays. In my view anyway. And you got AIDS, you don\u2019t want to have to deal with somebody out in the battlefield if you get shot if you know he is gay. You\u2019re going to deal with it, try to patch his wound, which you have to do. And then catch AIDS from him, you know. Those are the issues that people don\u2019t think about when they condemn the Armed Forces, well they\u2019re preyudice or whatever. There\u2019s a lot more to it than that."

I was draftee, so when I finished my two years I got out and went home, back to Miami and looked around and decided I was going to go into heating and air conditioning. And so I went to school and then I had to work. And I said, \u201cWell this ain\u2019t going to get it.\u201d No time for myself or anything else. Went to school, from school you went to work and next morning got up, went to school, went to work. You had no time for yourself, nothing. So I said, \u201cWell I\u2019m going to go back into the Army, this time voluntarily. I\u2019ll make the Army a career.\u201d Because I liked the Service, its purpose. And during that time we went up to a place called L.Z. X-Ray, which is now longer classified anyway. But it was up on the Czechoslovakian border and there was a bridge there that was mined. And you went up there, pulled your duty for a month at a time. And if the balloon ever would go up, or the East Germans would attack the West, the job was to blow up the bridge. It was all mined and all that. So then I realized, I seen the border and all that, I realized that this whole, back basically, the Russians were back to where the Nazis were. Plus I read, I don\u2019t know then or a little later, Solzhenitsyn\u2019s book about the gulags and all that. And I said, heck, they\u2019re no better than the Germans were. So anyway I decided I was going to go back into the Service. So, I re-enlisted and lo and behold they went and sent me back to Germany. [Laughing.] That was my second tour in Germany. We were sent to Kaiserslautern and spent three years there. It was an Army Depot. I went into the maintenance field there. Then I came back, went to the 18\" Airborne Corps in Bragg, North Carolina. And from Bragg, North Carolina there was a little altercation in 28 the Dominican Republic. There was a Leftist uprising and they had to send in the 82\u2122 Airborne and I was with the 556 Light Maintenance Company and we were in there for support. My platoon went in to support the 82\u2122 in their operation in the Dominican Republic. That was \u201865. Came back from there, our unit was declared D-1, which means that we were alerted that we were going to get shipped to \u2018Nam. So we had to pack everything, all the equipment of the unit and all that stuff. That was going on, the deadline rates which means the equipment, inoperability of a lot of the equipment on post at Fort Bragg got so big that they told us to unpack our stuff and go back to work. [Laughing.] So, we went back to work and then they started taking individuals. Like me, they took me, not me, but from the unit just individuals and shipped them to Vietnam. So 1966, I was sent to Vietnam. I was there in the Central Highlands for a year. And say well I\u2019m just going to go back to the States and get shipped back here again, so I might as well extend. So, I extended, got promoted and was sent to the Korean Tiger Division, support of the Korean Tiger Division, along Highway 1, between Bomber 2 and Elza English (ph)*. Anytime the Korean Tiger went out on a sweep and destroy, we went with them in support of them. In \u201868 I came back to, from \u201866 through \u201868, I was in Vietnam. I came back from Vietnam in, I think it was November \u201868 and was assigned to Fort Knox. I reported in, in December \u201868 to Fort Knox and I became an instructor in the Armor School."

            "answer": "No, I was all for the war. I believe we did the right thing. And I still believe we did the right thing, actually. Except you can\u2019t fight a war when the people are not with you. To me that was the thing, because we were justified in what we were doing. I mean the North Koreans were attacking the South and it proved, I mean, it shamefully, the reporters and everything, they all twisted everything to suit their views. But in fact, we were right. The North Koreans basically, if not for us, they probably would have gobbled up all of Southeast Asia, the Communists. They wound up, years later, they took over Cambodia. Laos, they already controlled. So basically the dominant theory was right, even though the reporters disputed it. So, we stood up against the Communists. And that\u2019s eventually after Reagan, finally they collapsed. But we basically contained them and that was Truman\u2019s policy, containing the Communists from spreading. If we wouldn\u2019t have opposed them, heck probably over two-thirds of the world today would have been all in the communist top. You know, so, in my view we did the right thing. I know a lot of people opposed it. And I got called a baby killer when I came back on leave from \u2018Nam. After my first year there I extended, so they gave me thirty days\u2019 leave. So I came in, in Fort Lewis, Washington and everybody said, \u201cChange clothes. Get in civilian clothes, don\u2019t go out in the airport in the clothes.\u201d I said, \u201cI fought for this country in these clothes, it was my uniform.

And I just kept walking. Don\u2019t call me no baby killer. I never killed no baby. I came home in my uniform, and I hauled back to \u2018Nam after a month leave, but on my uniform and went back. I believe firmly in, you know, I\u2019m not hiding. I think we did the ? Schlisser was with E-Co 43\" Sig BN, in the Binh Dinh mountains of the Central Highlands. 29 right thing. I know a lot of people disagree. But it\u2019s not true. We didn\u2019t lose a single battle in \u2018Nam. Nota single, they can\u2019t point to one single engagement that the United States Army or the Marine Corps, the United States Forces lost. Not a single one. Every battle that we fought against the North Vietnamese we won. But they made it out that we lost, and we didn\u2019t. The people who lost is the comm... the politicians here in Washington. Because they first of all tied one hand behind your back and said you can only fight with one hand. And you don\u2019t go to war that way. It\u2019s ridiculous. So anyway, so yeah, I thought it was justified. I was for the Vietnam War and I still say it was justified. Everything we found out up to now it just reinforces my view that we were justified in doing it. Not the way we did it. Now, I agree we should never have fought the way we did. We should have gone in with the purpose of winning and we should have won. The way you did that is you gone into North Vietnam and kicked their butt and got it over with. Instead of just, you know, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t get into Cambodia, you can\u2019t bomb this, you can\u2019t do that.\u201d You can\u2019t fight no war that a-way and win. Crazy. Just like, you know, I was interviewed by WAVE 3 TV. They wanted to know about Kosovo, what my views were. I told them, I said, \u201cWell I\u2019m not talking for the Jewish community. You want my view, I'll talk for myself. My view.\u201d And I said, \u201cFirst of all, anybody said that is a genocide 1s a liar. There was no genocide in Kosovo.\u201d And now it\u2019s proved out, it\u2019s true. There wasn\u2019t any. Sure, I\u2019m not saying there wasn\u2019t atrocities. But there\u2019s a big difference between atrocities and genocide. I told them, \u201cI wish they would have taken my family and put them on a passenger train and take them to the border and put us off. All of us would have been together.\u201d You know. I don\u2019t call that genocide. Sure they killed some here, killed there, but that\u2019s atrocities they did to scare the population so they would run. That\u2019s a long ways from genocide. Now Cambodia, that was genocide. Did anybody open their mouth and say anything or do anything, where it really counted? No, they didn\u2019t. You know. To me, we have no business in Kosovo, that stuff been going on now for hundreds of years. And even while we sitting there, you know, they killing each other. The minute we move out of there, we be there a hundred years from now, we be still sitting there to keep them apart. They need to settle themselves. And same thing in Bosnia. Bosnia, I don\u2019t care what anybody says. The minute European forces get out of there, United States and NATO get out of Bosnia, they\u2019Il be right at each other\u2019s throat. And they say Kosovo, you know, ethnic cleansing. Well, where were we when Croatia forced out over half a million Serbs? We didn\u2019t say a word, so what 1s the difference here? The Croats I hate. They were with the Nazis. I mean they were allies to the Nazis. We caused, the United States caused most of the stuff that\u2019s going on in Balkan now. It\u2019s our fault. Okay? When Croatia, when Tito died and Croatia was the first one to declare that they are, their independence. Without asking any questions, anything, right away we jumped in and recognized them as independent country. Okay? Well, they murdered a quarter of a million Serbs during the Second World War, including, plus Jews. The Croats. Okay? You think that the last of the Serbs are going, who live there, are going to agree to come again under the rule of the Croats? You got to be crazy. I mean, you got to know the history of the world before you meddle. And if you don\u2019t understand what the history 1s, they got no business meddling in there where you don\u2019t know what the hell you're doing. That\u2019s my view anyway. I\u2019m very upset about it, because I don\u2019t think that, you know, we had any business in there at all. But anyway, when they asked me I told them, I said there was no, you know, genocide there. There might have been atrocities, but there\u2019s no genocide from what I consider, you know. They were comparing it to the Holocaust."

In other words, even as a, when I was, right after the war in Sweden, you know. And some of the children in the orphanage, whatever, they were for the Russians, the communists, Left inclination. We always had big argument, even as a little boy then, and I was always defending the United States, because I felt, you know with my dad being from, born here and everything, I felt, you know, as an American, [Laughing.] even though I had never been here.

I have no problem with somebody like Joan Baez and all the other ones who opposed the war. That\u2019s why we fought. I mean, they have the right to speak their view. They\u2019re Americans and I respect their views. I might not agree with it, but I respect it. I cannot expect, accept somebody like Jane Fonda, who went to North Vietnam, you know, with North Vietnamese troops and there was prisoners of war in the Hanoi Hilton and stuff. And they went in to look at them. Any show that she is in, that is not on my TV. I will not. Pll turn the station. I will not have anything that Jane Fonda has played in, movie, whatever.

I\u2019m not setting any alterior motives. It might have been very noble motives for them to oppose it. I\u2019m not condemning anybody. I respect Muhammad Ali. He opposed the Vietnam War, but he had the courage of his convictions. He stayed in this country. He said I won\u2019t fight because I\u2019m not, you know, whatever. And was willing to go to jail if he had to for what he believed in. I respect that. I cannot respect someone like Clinton, you know, who did everything he could to stay out and then he lies about it.

So, I said, \u201cYou know what? All these months you\u2019ve been asking me to go with you home and all that, so Pll take you home this weekend.\u201d And we come back... I worked with him on his car, trying to get it fixed. We couldn\u2019t get it fixed in time. So, I said, \u201cWell, Pll take you home.\u201d That\u2019s the way it went.

I respect everybody else\u2019s faith as long as he practices and don\u2019t expect somebody else to do it. You understand what I\u2019m saying? Don\u2019t force, don\u2019t try to push iton me. Your faith is your faith and I respect you, you and your faith. But that\u2019s your faith and don\u2019t try to convert me or push me or get me to... you know. 36"

            "question": "Was there ever a point where you felt it would be important to you to marry a Jewish woman? Where your Jewish identity was important enough to you that you felt like you had to do whatever you could to carry on the tradition?",
            "answer": "That\u2019s a tough one. I guess at one time, at one time, yes. I guess at one time that occurred to me, okay. But... I shouldn\u2019t say this, but anyway. While I was in the military in Israel, okay, we were on duty in the Jerusalem sector. It wasn\u2019t a war, it was after. The Jordanians still had the old city. And to go to our post we had to go through a section of Jerusalem called Mea Shearim, which means \u201ca hundred gates,\u201d which was the ultra, ultra, Orthodox. And every time we had to go through there to switch reliefs, you know, we had to go through their section, their neighborhood. And on Sabbath we used to go through there with a vehicle. They used to stone us. Okay? So I looked at this and I said to myself, what\u2019s the difference between the fanatics, the Jewish fanatics and the Ayatollah fanatics and all the other fanatics? There\u2019s not one iota difference between them. They\u2019re all zealots for whatever their faith is. So, I reverted back to what I told you initially. I believe in Israel, beneath the country, for no other reason is the Jewish people as a nation have a homeland. But for me, not for religious purposes. There\u2019s, like I was there visiting my sister in, you know for Passover this year. And there\u2019s such a conflict between the real religious and the non-religious there, you know. It\u2019s crazy. You believe in your faith, practice it. Leave the other people alone. If they believe in... my sister is like me. She doesn\u2019t bang her head against the wall. She believes in God and she holds basically all the Jewish holidays. She has to because it\u2019s national holidays. But she\u2019s not religious, goes to Temple all the time and all that stuff. Everybody has a right to live their own life the way they see it\u2019s fit. And that\u2019s what I believe in. I believe in everybody should do, if I respect you... my neighbor here is a very religious Baptist guy. A wonderful guy, wonderful friend. He\u2019s been friend with me now for thirty years, since we\u2019ve been here. We\u2019ve been real close friends. We help each other. Anything I got he\u2019s welcome to it and the same with him. Anything I need, if I needed help, he\u2019d be there. I know he would. That\u2019s how good of friends we are. And I respect him. He goes to church on Wednesdays. He goes to church on Sundays. He\u2019s a church elder. I respect, I respect my brother-in-law, you know. It\u2019s their faith, it\u2019s fine. He never try to force, you know, push his stuff on me. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. Everybody should... and I believe if you have a faith, you should live it. Not go to church on Sunday and then cheat people on Monday. That\u2019s my principle, that\u2019s me. What you hear, what I say is what I mean. That\u2019s always been my, I don\u2019t say something that I don\u2019t mean. If I tell you I was going to do something, you can put in the bank that I was going to do it. Except if I\u2019m dead or laying there paralyzed where I can\u2019t move. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. If I promised to do something, I will do it. My word is my bond, basically. With me, you can shake hands with me, that\u2019s just like a contract. If I say something I was going to do, I\u2019m going to do it. And that\u2019s all there 1s to it."

Don\u2019t think I am stupid. I\u2019m not. You know, I might not have book learning to the max or get a certificate. But I made up for that by reading a lot and getting my education in the school of hard knocks, is what taught me. They 37 knew wherever the job needed to get done, as long as... turn me loose, tell me what you want done, give me the resources to do it with and I will get it done. That was me. [Laughing. |"

            "answer": "I really couldn\u2019t tell you. Something inner, something inside of me drove me and what it was I really couldn\u2019t put it into words. If I would say any particular thing... I mean, you got to take each one on its own merit. You can\u2019t just lump them all together. The war in Israel was a question of survival for the country. Because they closed the Suez Canal down. The lifeline for Israel, because the oil must come in. At the time there was no pipeline from the Red Sea, so all the oil was coming through the Suez Canal and it was delivered to Haifa to the refineries there, okay? So I didn\u2019t make the decision to go to war. I was just a guy who was in the Reserves. I was already out of the Service in Israel. And we had a password and when you heard your password, you packed your bags and you reported to your unit. You had a specific location where you met. It was a civilian mobilization of the Army and you went and did what you were supposed to have done. I guess duty, if anything that drove me I guess was duty, responsibility, duty to what I believe was right. If there was anything to define. Now as far as \u2018Nam, again, I didn\u2019t... 1t was the United States Government decision to have, to go to the aid of the South Vietnamese. It wasn\u2019t mine. I just, again it was duty. I was in the Service, I was a career soldier. Why would you be a career soldier? What, you\u2019re going to run when the fighting starts? That\u2019s what you train for all the time. To when the nation calls you, then you be there to do your... you know, and do your duty. And I hope anyway, that I was instrumental in saving some guy\u2019s life, because with my experience, you know, I helped guide a lot of other guys to maybe, if I wasn\u2019t there maybe somebody who had less experience would have got him killed. I\u2019m not saying that would have been the case, but basically the professional guys in the Service, the non- commissioned officers, who had experience from the Korean War and then served in \u2018Nam, they\u2019re basically who trained the new guys, you know, and got them understand what a war is all about. How to survive. If anything I guess, duty is the main, main theme here, I think, from what you\u2019re asking. Why I joined the Service, why I volunteered and stayed in the Service, that\u2019s a different story. That had a lot to do with economy and all this stuff. Plus I had an opportunity to use my talent, my God-given talents that I had in the best way and advance my own career was in the military instead of the civilian life. But as far as when the war started, I think the main thing was duty. I mean duty to do your job. 38"

            "question": "Were you in a combat unit while you were in \u2018Nam? Or what were you?",
            "answer": "I was actually in the Signal outfit. The first time I was there I was in a place called Binh Dinh Mountain, which was a seven thousand foot mountain. And it was about, I guess twenty miles from Dalat. There was no road in or out. All our supplies had to come by air. We got re- supplied. And up there we had a relay, communication relay station to the North side, North Vietnam and part of South Vietnam, the north part and the south part. Plus we had Air Force up there, who were relaying instructions to the B-52 Bombers. So we\u2019re sitting on a seven thousand foot mountain, and jungle all the way around us. Charlie was down there. We lived in bunkers. We got attacked by mortars, you know, and that kind of that stuff. We didn\u2019t have no direct confrontation. Then from there I moved to a place called Phu Ti Valley\u2019 which is not far from Nha Trang and there we were with the Korean Tiger Division. That is an Infantry Division, who were actually doing the combat. We were supporting them and going out to, when they went out for a sweep and destroy mission, we went out to provide them communication. So, we got shot at, but we weren\u2019t involved in direct, you know, face-to-face, grunt job. The Koreans did that. So, but I was running Highway One between Ban Me Thuot, and every morning before you even got on there, you had to wait for them to clear all the mines out of there. So you never knew from one minute to the next when you\u2019re going to get ona mine. And then the Vietnamese had this nice little trick, they would have this little hot pot, motorcycle-type tax1 cabs. And you would come around with your truck and they would pull out in front of you to slow you down, like ina curve. And you had to stop down to not run over them. And when you slowed down, they would ambush you and start shooting you, at you from the side. So what you define \u201ccombat\u201d? In Vietnam there wasn\u2019t any really... no, I wasn\u2019t in the infantry unit. But in our base camp, we got attacked. We killed nine guys there and the stetchel (ph)charged us. One of them was our base barber that we killed. He was a Viet Cong. So you never knew who your, I mean who was your friend, who was your enemy. It was a weird kind of a war. There was no front line, like in Korea or Second World War. You didn\u2019t know who was your friend or who was your foe, besides your own buddies in your own unit. Because all Vietnamese could have been Viet Cong. We had to go to this and we had to lock down our gas caps on our trucks. What they would do if you didn\u2019t have the locks on them, they would take a hand grenade, put a rubber band around it, pull the pin, drop it inside your gas tank. Then the gas would eat away the rubber band, pop the thing and blow you to smithereens. So, you had to actually lock down with a lock, you had to lock your caps so they couldn\u2019t stick nothing in there. Children were, they would hawk on the side of the road. They would try to sell you coke. Well if you\u2019re stupid enough and you bought that coke, a lot of them had ground glass in it. If you drank that stuff it tore your guts up inside with shreds, slivers of glass. [Laughing.] So it was a different kind of war. It wasn\u2019t the type of war where you could say who was a combat guy and who wasn\u2019t. But no, I wasn\u2019t... you know, I was on sweep and destroy missions with the Koreans. I took convoys from the seven thousand-foot mountain down to the air field about twenty miles away to pick up our rations and water, drinking water and all that stuff. We got ambushed periodically on the road and all that. Well, you call that combat? I would call that combat, but I wasn\u2019t one of those guys that were crawling down those tunnels, tunnel rats or anything like that. I wasn\u2019t in the Infantry outfit fighting. I got a good friend who works with me as a volunteer, he was Special Forces. He was on long range patrol. They went out to search Charlie. Now I would say he was in the trenches more than I was. I just reacted when Charlie attacked me. He went 3 Also called Rok Valley. 39 out looking for him, that\u2019s different. But I did whatever was assigned me. I came to \u2018Nam. I was supposed to go to a direct support unit. Not even get close to where the combat was. I was supposed to work on repairing vehicles and stuff. I got to Cam Ranh Bay and they said, \u201cEh, you are now, guess what. You are now a 6-3 Charlie. You are a motor sergeant. You are going up in the Central Highlands.\u201d Instead of staying right there in Nha Trang. Believe me, two years in \u2018Nam and I never seen Saigon. I don\u2019t know what Saigon looks like. I never been there. All my time was up in the Central Highlands. I took two R&R tours, one I went to Australia and one I went to Hong Kong. Get away from it to relax."
