I guess picking up whoever was still living. Matter of fact they took us to the German hospital. I guess they cleaned it out whoever was in there. Anyway they took it over and that\u2122s where they were taking us. Then they put up big, old hospital tent s. That\u2122s where the children, they brought the children to, we were in a hospital, a big hospital tent. I remember that.

There was a woman who was a cook there, who was basically supposed to look after me. Look over me. And they enrolled me in a Swedish school, so now I had to learn Swedish. [Laughing.] You know. And went to school in Sweden. Now I went to one grade in Hungary and what little schooling I got there at the orphanage. And from there they started me off\u2013 I think in sixth, according to my age, which was sixth grade or so mething like that. Sixth, seventh grade. And obviously it wasn\u2122t easy.

As a matter of fact, you\u2122re probably only about the second or third person I ever talked about, talked about it at all. First time I ever, well beside Yad Vashem, you know, when we got interviewed, but that was with both my sisters there and they did most of the talking. And last year, the Jewish Commun ity Center here in Louisville asked me to join them on Yom Ha\u2013 Remembran ce, Day of Remembrance and all that, to tell my story. So I reluctantly agreed that I would tell them whatever I remember. And so I did. I went up there and said my piece. And that was, be side this here, that\u2122s about the only time. I don\u2122t talk about it. And matter of fact, Professo r Dickstein wanted me to go to one of the high schools and speak to the children about my experien ce and I declined.

So, I don\u2122t, normally don\u2122t talk about it. I want to put it behind me, not in front of me."

            "answer": "Well, I really don\u2122t know. I just, I think probabl y the main thing that motivated me on that is I read in places where, especially where they had the trial in Britain about people saying it never happened and all that stuff, it\u2122s somebody\u2122s fantas ies. And I\u2122m here to tell you that it did happen. And I guess that\u2122s probably the main reas on that I agreed to talk about it, is that, you know, people are trying to change history. And if you don\u2122t learn nothing, you don\u2122t learn no lesson from what happened, it can happen again. Th at was my biggest motivation of joining the US Army, is I felt that the Russi ans weren\u2122t that much better than the Nazis were. They had the gulags, they had the camps. May not have b een prosecuting Jews per se, but they were prosecuting human beings. That\u2122s basically what decided, probably the only force in the world USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0014 18 18during this period of time that could prevent so mething like that happening is the U.S. Armed Forces. And so that was my main reasoning for join ing the Service. I served in the Israeli Army. I fought in the Sinai Desert in \u201a56. And so I\u2122ve been through the wringer. But that wouldn\u2122t affect Israel, doesn\u2122t affect the world. And probably the only force in the world at this time of human history who can make a difference is the United States and the U.S. Armed Forces.

But I\u2122m wondering about whether you, you were questioning or whether you understood why you and your family and others had been singled out for this, for this horrible persecution. Did you have any understanding of what\u2013?",
            "answer": "Yeah, I understood that it was basically based on my religion, basically that\u2122s the only thing that\u2013 you know. And then as I got older and I read. I\u2122m not educated very well. I finished high school GED and I got some college behind me, about sixty-eight credit hours. But basically I read a lot, and my understandi ng that the foundation for this disaster has been laid a long, long time and is basically\u2013 I don\u2122t blam e any particular faith, but basically they were teaching in churches and stuff that the Jews killed Jesus an d this and that and always had limitation on what Jews can do. They always kept them outside of the mainstream society. And they were prohibited to be in certain trades and they were always prohibited in doing certain things. So they were always kept like foreigners, you know, strangers or foreigners, whatever you want to call them. And then the church teaching basica lly demonized them. So, I don\u2122t think it was too hard for somebody like Hitler to come along and demagogue the issue to the point where people didn\u2122t, didn\u2122t care. Because it\u2122s supposed to be that most of th em were Christians, supposedly supposed to love thy brother and turn the other cheek and all that stuff, they\u2122re teaching. But I guess that wasn\u2122t what, what actually happened. I\u2122ve seen them take a little baby and smash him against, his head against the wall. Kill him. And what human being would do something like that? And then they go to church to pray? I mean, you look back at most of the wars in this world today, most of the time, most of it is based on religion. Take a look right now. Sudan, got a Muslim against the Christians. Northern Irelan d, Catholics against the Pr otestants. You go to India, you got the\u2013 Sri Lanka, you got one sect fighting another and again it\u2122s religion. Iraq, Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims. So every plac e you look at, to me anyway, from what I read and seen, the biggest disaster in this world is religion. That\u2122s my view."

Because you can take the Bible as a religion or you can take the Old Testament as a history of a people.

And they lived here, matter of fact, I got an aunt, who was born here and never left here. She\u2122s passed away now in Houston.

Took a hundred hours for the whole, it took the whole Sinai Desert one hundred hours, that\u2122s all, so. I did my job, whatever I wa s supposed to have done. I did mine and everybody else. And to understand the Israeli Army you have to realize that they didn\u2122t even have transportation. And guys who missed their units, they hitchhiked to get to their units, to join them. You know, in those days anyway, I don\u2122t know about now, but in those days, people knew their duty and you didn\u2122t have to tell them. They knew what they had to do and it got done.

And when everybody else came back, because Eisenhower forced, you know, the Israelis to withdraw from the Si nai. And since I was in the Engineers, I stayed behind. And what we did, we plowed up all the roads coming b ack from Sinai, this a-way, and we plowed up all the roads, destroyed all the tracks, train tracks. We took the train tracks, blew them up and all the bridges, anything to slow them down. To slow the Egyptian Army from coming back in. And so we were the last ones out of Sinai.

I felt that if I wanted to become a citizen of the United States it\u2122s my obligation to serve, you kno w, I felt, my country. I had no problems with that. So the only problem I really had was, you know, to me, basi c training and all that was no big deal. I been through all that. [Laughing.] So, that was no big deal for me. But anyway, language, I wasn\u2122t speaking that well English during those days yet. I had a good friend, went to basic training together, his name was James B. Smith, J.B. He was from North Carolina. And he basically took me under his wings and he wa s teaching me English. Anytime I was saying something that wasn\u2122t right, he would usually correct me and all that stuff. He was like, Mutt and Jeff? He was tall, skinny guy, you know, and I was short, stocky. And you didn\u2122t have to look far, if you seen one of us there the other one wasn\u2122t too far away, was somewhere nearby. So we became really close friends. I\u2122m a godfather to one of his daughters. Even today we still keep in touch. So we really been good friends. That was when I first, you know, got in. The only thing I didn\u2122t like about it, after basic training and advanced individual training. We both were straight leg Infantry and they sent us to Germany. [Laughing.] Sent me right back to Germany, so that\u2122s the only part, that was kind of rough on me, you know. I got over it anyway."

            "answer": "No, that was before me. I mean integration star ted before I got into the Service. The integration started with Truman during the Korean War. Pr ior to the Korean War he ordered the Army to integrate its units. Because before you had separate black, separate\u2013 but we had a lot of racial problems even when I first got into the Service in th e sixties. As a matter of fact, we had a race riot and we had fights, racial fights and that kind of stuff. B ecause, you know, for me, since I did not, wasn\u2122t raised with black, first time I ever s een blacks was when I got to the United States. I had no prejudice. I wasn\u2122t raised with any kind of prejudice against anybody. So, I basically, as I always, I would take an individual for himself. You know, I rate an individual for the individual. If he deserve respect, he got respect. If I didn\u2122t care for him, whether it\u2122s white, black, whatever, then I didn\u2122t care for him. It wa sn\u2122t because of his race. It\u2122s because I didn\u2122t care for his character or his behavior or, you now. That\u2122s the way, you know, it was for me. But when I got in in 1960, you had a Brown Boot Army. I don\u2122t know if you understand what a Brown Boot Army was. But Brown Boot Army, you had\u2013 basically, we had, like, our Company, we had a room that was empty. There wasn\u2122t a stitch of furniture, anything, it was an empty room. If you had any problem with anybo dy, you and him just went into the room and settled your business with your fists. That\u2122s the way things were done. We had a Platoon Sergeant, his name was Cooper. He was half Indi an and half Irish. And he was about 6\u21224\ufb02 and weighed about two hundred thirty, somewhere ar ound there. And you messed up and he\u2122d take you into the room there and put you through the woodshed. So he had a very well behaved USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0014 27 27Platoon. Everybody worked together. You can\u2122t legislate away prejudice. That\u2122s something that you learn at home from your parents, from your society, from your parents, whatever, church, whatever. What you can do with the Army is, you force civility. Regardless of whether you like him or not, while you are in the unit and while you are in the Army, you treat him the way you expect to be treated. And later on when I became a Platoon Sergeant, whatever, that was my guiding principle. I didn\u2122t care whethe r\u2013 I say, \ufb01I don\u2122t care if you like him or not. That\u2122s neither here nor there. You two work together, perform the job, be civil to each other. Once you get to know each other maybe you like him.\ufb02 You know what I\u2122m saying? That\u2122s all you can expect. You can\u2122t legislate love or you can\u2122t legislate racial prejudice away. That\u2122s silly to even think about it. Just like now, all this silly thing about the gays and all that stuff. I don\u2122t hate gays. Bible says that\u2122s wrong, but I would want to know if anybody in my unit was gay that I had to fight with. I might have t o, he might have to give me mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Or I had to go to the shower with him, if I know he is gay I would be uncomfortable. Not a question that I hate him. That question doesn\u2122t make no sense, because in the Service you live so close together, you know? Th ere is no little shower stall where you go in in your privacy. They got one big room with a bunch of show er heads where everybody takes showers. And guys just feel uncomfortable when they know somebody is gay. And that\u2122s the problem, not that anybody has anything against ga ys. In my view anyway. And you got AIDS, you don\u2122t want to have to deal with somebody out in the battlefield if you get shot if you know he is gay. You\u2122re going to deal with it, try to patch his wound, which you have to do. And then catch AIDS from him, you know. Those are the issues that people don\u2122t think about when they condemn the Armed Forces, well they\u2122re prejudice or whatever. There\u2122s a lot more to it than that."

And so I went to school and then I had to work. And I said, \ufb01Well this ain\u2122t going to get it.\ufb02 No time for myself or anything else.

So I said, \ufb01Well I\u2122m going to go back into the Arm y, this time voluntarily. I\u2122ll make the Army a career.\ufb02 Because I liked the Service, its purpo se. And during that time we went up to a place called L.Z. X-Ray, which is now longer classified anyway. But it was up on the Czechoslovakian border and there was a bridge there that was mined. And you went up there, pulled your duty for a month at a time. And if the balloon ev er would go up, or the East Germans would attack the West, the job was to blow up the bridge. It was all mined and all that. So then I realized, I seen the border and all that, I realized that this whole, back basically, the Russians were back to where the Nazis were. Plus I read, I don\u2122t know then or a little later, Solzhenitsyn\u2122s book about the gulags and all that. And I said, heck, they\u2122re no better than the Germans were. So anyway I decided I was going to go back into the Service. So, I re-enlisted and lo and behold they went and sent me back to Germany. [Laughing.] That was my second tour in Germany. We were sent to Kaiserslautern and spent three years there. It was an Army Depot. I went into the maintenance field there. Then I came back, went to the 18 th Airborne Corps in Bragg, North Carolina. And from Bragg, North Carolina there was a little altercation in USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0014 29 29the Dominican Republic. There was a Leftist uprising and they had to send in the 82nd Airborne and I was with the 556 Light Maintenance Compa ny and we were in there for support. My platoon went in to support the 82nd in their operation in the Domi nican Republic. That was \u201a65. Came back from there, our unit was declared D1, which means that we were alerted that we were going to get shipped to \u201aNam. So we had to pack everything, all the equipment of the unit and all that stuff. That was going on, the deadline rates which means the equipment, inoperability of a lot of the equipment on post at Fo rt Bragg got so big that they told us to unpack our stuff and go back to work. [Laughing.] So, we went back to work and then they started taking individuals. Like me, they took me, not me, but from the un it just individuals and shipped them to Vietnam. So 1966, I was sent to Vietna m. I was there in the Central Highlands for a year. And say well I\u2122m just going to go back to the States and get shipped back here again, so I might as well extend. So, I extended, got promoted and was sent to the Korean Tiger Division, support of the Korean Tiger Division, along Highway 1, between Bomber 2 and Elza English (ph) 2. Anytime the Korean Tiger went out on a sweep and destroy, we went with them in support of them. In \u201a68 I came back to, from \u201a66 through \u201a68, I was in Vietnam. I came back from Vietnam in, I think it was November \u201a68 and was assigned to Fort Knox. I reported in, in December \u201a68 to Fort Knox and I became an instructor in the Armor School."

And how did you feel about the cause in Vietnam? By that point were you, were you\u2013?",
            "answer": "No, I was all for the war. I believe we did th e right thing. And I still believe we did the right thing, actually. Except you can\u2122t fight a war when the people are not with you. To me that was the thing, because we were justified in what we were doing. I mean the North Koreans were attacking the South and it proved, I mean, it shamefully, the reporters and everything, they all twisted everything to suit their views. But in fact, we were right. The North Koreans basically, if not for us, they probably would have gobbled up all of Southeast Asia, the Communists. They wound up, years later, they took over Cambodia. La os, they already controlled. So basically the dominant theory was right, even though the repo rters disputed it. So, we stood up against the Communists. And that\u2122s eventually after Reagan, finally they collapsed. But we basically contained them and that was Truman\u2122s policy, co ntaining the Communists from spreading. If we wouldn\u2122t have opposed them, heck probably over twothirds of the world today would have been all in the communist top. You know, so, in my view we did the right thing. I know a lot of people opposed it. And I got called a baby killer when I came back on leave from \u201aNam. After my first year there I extended, so they gave me thir ty days\u2122 leave. So I came in, in Fort Lewis, Washington and everybody said, \ufb01Change clothes. Get in civilian clothes, don\u2122t go out in the airport in the clothes.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I fought for this country in these clothes, it was my uniform. I\u2122ll be doggone if I\u2122m going to change clothes. I\u2122 m going home in uniform.\ufb02 \ufb01Oh, you\u2122re crazy, you\u2122re crazy.\ufb02 \ufb01That\u2122s okay.\ufb02 Anyway I went and I went to Seattle to th e airport and there were Hare Krishna and all them other ones. And, \ufb01Baby killer!\ufb02 I went and punched him in the mouth and knocked him down. [Laughing.] A cop was standing there looking, he didn\u2122t, he just smiled, he didn\u2122t say nothing. And I just kept wa lking. Don\u2122t call me no baby killer. I never killed no baby. I came home in my uniform, and I hauled back to \u201aNam after a month leave, but on my uniform and went back. I believe firmly in, you know, I\u2122m not hiding. I think we did the 2 Schlisser was with E-Co 43 rd Sig BN, in the Binh Dinh mountains of the Central Highlands. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0014 30 30right thing. I know a lot of people disagree. But it\u2122s not true. We didn\u2122t lose a single battle in \u201aNam. Not a single, they can\u2122t point to one sing le engagement that the United States Army or the Marine Corps, the United States Forces lost. Not a single one. Every battle that we fought against the North Vietnamese we won. But they made it out that we lost, and we didn\u2122t. The people who lost is the comm\u2013 the politicians here in Washington. Because th ey first of all tied one hand behind your back and said you can only fight with one hand. And you don\u2122t go to war that way. It\u2122s ridiculous. So anyway, so yeah, I thought it was justified. I was for the Vietnam War and I still say it was justified. Everything we found out up to now it just reinforces my view that we were justified in doing it. Not the way we did it. Now, I agree we should never have fought the way we did. We should have gone in with the purpose of winning and we should have won. The way you did that is you gone into North Vietnam and kicked their butt and got it over with. Instead of just, you know, \ufb01Well, you can\u2122t get into Cambodia, you can\u2122t bomb this, you can\u2122t do that.\ufb02 You can\u2122t fight no war that a-way and win. Crazy. Just like, you know, I was interviewed by WAVE 3 TV. They wanted to know about Kosovo, what my views were. I told them, I said, \ufb01Well I\u2122m not talking for th e Jewish community. You want my view, I\u2122ll talk for myself. My view.\ufb02 And I sai d, \ufb01First of all, anybody said that is a genocide is a liar. There was no genocide in Kosovo.\ufb02 And now it\u2122s proved out, it\u2122s true. There wasn\u2122t any. Sure, I\u2122m not saying there wasn\u2122t atrocities. But there\u2122s a big difference be tween atrocities and genocide. I told them, \ufb01I wish they would have taken my family and put them on a passenger train and take them to the border and put us off. All of us w ould have been together.\ufb02 You know. I don\u2122t call that genocide. Sure they killed some here, killed there, but that\u2122s atrocities they did to scare the population so they would run. That\u2122s a long ways from genocide. Now Cambodia, that was genocide. Did anybody open their mouth and sa y anything or do anything, where it really counted? No, they didn\u2122t. You know. To me, we have no business in Kosovo, that stuff been going on now for hundreds of years. And even while we sitting there, you know, they killing each other. The minute we move out of there, we be there a hundred years from now, we be still sitting there to keep them apart. They need to settle themselves. And same thing in Bosnia. Bosnia, I don\u2122t care what anybody says. The minu te European forces get out of there, United States and NATO get out of Bosnia, they\u2122ll be right at each other\u2122s throat. And they say Kosovo, you know, ethnic cleansing. Well, where were we when Croatia forced out over half a million Serbs? We didn\u2122t say a word, so what is the difference here? The Cr oats I hate. They were with the Nazis. I mean they were a llies to the Nazis. We caused, the United States caused most of the stuff that\u2122s going on in Balkan now. It\u2122s our faul t. Okay? When Croatia, when Tito died and Croatia was the first one to declare that they are, their independence. Without asking any questions, anything, right away we jumped in and recognized them as independent country. Okay? Well, they murdered a quarter of a million Serbs during the Second World War, including, plus Jews. The Croats. Okay? You think that the last of the Serbs are going, who live there, are going to agree to come again under the rule of the Croats? You got to be crazy. I mean, you got to know the history of the worl d before you meddle. And if you don\u2122t understand what the history is, they got no business meddling in there where you don\u2122t know what the hell you\u2122re doing. That\u2122s my view anyway. I\u2122m ve ry upset about it, because I don\u2122t think that, you know, we had any business in there at all. But anyway, when they asked me I told them, I said there was no, you know, genocide there. There might have been atro cities, but there\u2122s no genocide from what I consider, you know. They were comparing it to the Holocaust."

All these months you\u2122ve been asking me to go with you home and all that, so I\u2122ll take you home this weekend.\ufb02 And we come back\u2013 I worked with him on his car, trying to get it fixed.

That\u2122s the exact way it happened. So we got there and then Helen was, that evening, we got there late in the evening, late in the afternoon. That evening went out to the VFW Club to dance and drink. Anyway, she was there. And then, that was April, and I think a week or ten days later or two weeks later was the Kentucky Derby. So, Ray\u2122s wife was going to come up here, so Helen said, \ufb01Well, I\u2122ll come with you.\ufb02 You know, so, \ufb01Okay,\ufb02 so, one thing led to another. So that\u2122s how we met.

They used to stone us. Okay? So I looked at this and I said to myself, what\u2122s the differe nce between the fanatics, the Jewish fanatics and the Ayatollah fanatics an d all the other fanatics? There\u2122s not one iota difference between them. They\u2122re all zealots for wh atever their faith is. So, I reverted back to what I told you initially. I believe in Israel, beneath the country, for no other reason is the Jewish people as a nation have a homeland. But for me, not for religious purposes. There\u2122s, like I was there visiting my sister in, you know for Passover th is year. And there\u2122s such a conflict between the real religious and the non-religious there, you know. It\u2122s crazy. You believe in your faith, practice it. Leave the other people alone. If they believe in\u2013 my sister is like me. She doesn\u2122t bang her head against the wall. She believes in God and she holds basically all the Jewish holidays. She has to because it\u2122s national holiday s. But she\u2122s not religious, goes to Temple all the time and all that stuff. Everybody has a right to live their own life the way they see it\u2122s fit. And that\u2122s what I believe in. I believe in everybody should do, if I respect you\u2013 my neighbor here is a very religious Baptist guy. A wonderful guy, wonderful friend. He\u2122s been friend with me now for thirty years, since we \u2122ve been here. We\u2122ve been real close friends. We help each other. Anything I got he\u2122s welcome to it and the same with him. Anything I need, if I needed help, he\u2122d be there. I know he would. That\u2122s how good of friends we are. And I respect him. He goes to church on Wednesdays. He goes to church on Sundays. He\u2122s a church elder. I respect, I respect my brother-in-law, you know. It\u2122s their faith, it\u2122s fine. He never try to force, you know, push his stuff on me. That\u2122s all I\u2122m saying. Everybody should\u2013 and I believe if you have a faith, you should live it. Not go to church on Sunday and then cheat people on Monday. That\u2122s my principle, that\u2122s me. What you hear, wh at I say is what I mean. That\u2122s always been my, I don\u2122t say something that I don\u2122t mean. If I tell you I was going to do something, you can put in the bank that I was going to do it. Except if I\u2122m dead or laying there paralyzed where I can\u2122t move. That\u2122s what I\u2122m going to do. If I pr omised to do something, I will do it. My word is my bond, basically. With me, you can shake hands with me, that\u2122s just lik e a contract. If I say something I was going to do, I\u2122m going to do it. And that\u2122s all there is to it."

            "answer": "I really couldn\u2122t tell you. Something inner, so mething inside of me drove me and what it was I really couldn\u2122t put it into words. If I would say any particular thing\u2013 I mean, you got to take each one on its own merit. You can\u2122t just lump them all together. The war in Israel was a question of survival for the country. Because they closed the Suez Canal down. The lifeline for Israel, because the oil must come in. At the time there was no pipeline from the Red Sea, so all the oil was coming through the Suez Canal and it was delivered to Haifa to the refineries there, okay? So I didn\u2122t make the decision to go to war. I was just a guy who was in the Reserves. I was already out of the Service in Israel. And we had a password and when you heard your password, you packed your bags and you reported to your unit. You had a specific location where you met. It was a civilian mobilization of the Army and you went and did what you were supposed to have done. I guess duty, if anything that drove me I guess was duty, responsibility, duty to what I believe was right. If there was anything to define. Now as far as \u201aNam, again, I didn\u2122t\u2013 it was the United States Government d ecision to have, to go to the aid of the South Vietnamese. It wasn\u2122t mine. I just, again it was duty. I was in the Service, I was a career soldier. Why would you be a career soldier? What , you\u2122re going to run when the fighting starts? That\u2122s what you train for all the time. To wh en the nation calls you, then you be there to do your\u2013 you know, and do your duty. And I hope anyway, that I was instrumental in saving some guy\u2122s life, because with my experience, you know, I helped guide a lot of other guys to maybe, if I wasn\u2122t there maybe somebody who had less expe rience would have got him killed. I\u2122m not saying that would have been the case, but basically the professional guys in the Service, the non-commissioned officers, who had experience from the Korean War and then served in \u201aNam, they\u2122re basically who trained the new guys, you know, and got them understand what a war is all about. How to survive. If anything I guess, duty is the main, main theme here, I think, from what you\u2122re asking. Why I joined the Service, why I volunteered and stayed in the Service, that\u2122s a different story. That had a lot to do with economy and all this stuff. Plus I had an opportunity to use my talent, my God-given talents that I had in the best way and advance my own career was in the military inst ead of the civilian life. But as far as when the war started, I think the main thing was duty. I mean duty to do your job. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0014 39 39"

            "question": "Were you in a combat unit while you were in \u201aNam? Or what were you?",
            "answer": "I was actually in the Signal outfit. The firs t time I was there I was in a place called Binh Dinh Mountain, which was a seven thousand foot mounta in. And it was about, I guess twenty miles from Dalat. There was no road in or out. All our supplies had to come by air. We got re supplied. And up there we had a relay, communicat ion relay station to the North side, North Vietnam and part of South Vietnam, the north part and the south part. Plus we had Air Force up there, who were relaying instructions to the B-52 Bombers. So we\u2122re sitting on a seven thousand foot mountain, and jungle all th e way around us. Charlie was down there. We lived in bunkers. We got attacked by mortars, you know, and that ki nd of that stuff. We didn\u2122t have no direct confrontation. Then from there I moved to a place called Phu Ti Valley 3 which is not far from Nha Trang and there we were with the Korean Tiger Division. That is an Infantry Division, who were actually doing the combat. We were suppor ting them and going out to, when they went out for a sweep and destroy mission, we went out to provide them communicati on. So, we got shot at, but we weren\u2122t involved in direct, you know, face-to-face, grunt job. The Koreans did that. So, but I was running Highway One between Ban Me Thuot, and every morning before you even got on there, you had to wait for them to clear all the mines out of there. So you never knew from one minute to the next when you\u2122re going to get on a mine. And then the Vietnamese had this nice little trick, they would have this little hot pot, motorcycle-type taxi cabs. And you would come around with your truc k and they would pull out in front of you to slow you down, like in a curve. And you had to stop down to not run over them. And when you slowed down, they would ambush you and start shooting you, at you from the side. So what you define \ufb01combat\ufb02? In Vietnam there wasn\u2122t any really\u2013 no, I wasn\u2122t in the infantry unit. But in our base camp, we got attacked. We kill ed nine guys there and the stetchel (ph) charged us. One of them was our base barber that we killed. He was a Viet Cong. So you never knew who your, I mean who was your friend, who was your enemy. It was a weird kind of a war. There was no front line, like in Korea or Second World War. You didn\u2122t know who was your friend or who was your foe, besides your own buddies in your ow n unit. Because all Vietnamese could have been Viet Cong. We had to go to this and we had to lock down our gas caps on our trucks. What they would do if you didn\u2122t have the locks on them, they would take a hand grenade, put a rubber band around it, pull the pin, drop it inside your gas tank. Then the gas would eat away the rubber band, pop the thing and blow you to smithereen s. So, you had to actually lock down with a lock, you had to lock your caps so they couldn\u2122t stick nothing in there. Children were, they would hawk on the side of the road. They would try to sell you coke. Well if you\u2122re stupid enough and you bought that coke, a lot of them had ground glass in it. If you drank that stuff it tore your guts up inside with shreds, slivers of glass. [Laughing.] So it was a different kind of war. It wasn\u2122t the type of war where you could say who was a combat guy and who wasn\u2122t. But no, I wasn\u2122t\u2013 you know, I was on sweep and destroy missions with the Koreans. I took convoys from the seven thousand-foot mountain down to the air field about twenty miles away to pick up our rations and water, drinking water and all that stuff. We got ambushed periodically on the road and all that. Well, you call that combat? I would call that combat, but I wasn\u2122t one of those guys that were crawling down those tunnels, tunnel rats or anything like that. I wasn\u2122t in the Infantry outfit fighting. I got a good friend who works with me as a volunteer, he was Special Forces. He was on long range patrol. They went out to search Charlie. Now I would say he was in the trenches more than I was. I just reacted when Charlie attacked me. He went 3 Also called Rok Valley. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0014 40 40out looking for him, that\u2122s differe nt. But I did whatever was assigned me. I came to \u201aNam. I was supposed to go to a direct support unit. Not even get close to where the combat was. I was supposed to work on repairing vehicles and stuff. I got to Cam Ranh Bay and they said, \ufb01Eh, you are now, guess what. You are now a 6-3 Charlie. You are a motor sergeant. You are going up in the Central Highlands.\ufb02 Instead of staying right there in Nha Trang. Believe me, two years in \u201aNam and I never seen Saigon. I don\u2122t know what Saigon looks like. I never been there. All my time was up in the Central Highlands. I took two R&R tours, one I went to Australia and one I went to Hong Kong. Get away from it to relax."
