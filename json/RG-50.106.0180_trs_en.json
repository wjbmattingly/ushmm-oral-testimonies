            "question": "Okay. So let\u2122s talk now, what happened after that. What \u0152 where did you go after liberation?",
            "answer": "After the liberation, there was a small group of women, and we were liberated by the Russians. They took very good care of us, they supplied us with food, with clothes, because we were almost clothes-less. Nothing that we had on was a sack. No shoes, no nothing. The Russians supplied us with everything they could, but it didn\u2122t take us long \u0152 w-we stayed in a group, maybe eight or 10 women \u0152 girls mostly, young women. And must be we ate too much food, or the dirt, because we were invaded by \u0152 by lice, and two days, three days after, everybody fell sick. And by being sick, the Russians were afraid to come near us, and we didn\u2122t know what Interview with Helen Schwartz March 1, 2010 4 was wrong with us, because we probably had high temperature, and none of the girls was probably normal, and didn\u2122t know what happening. But when the Russians didn\u2122t come near us, we kept on asking, why don\u2122t we get any help, or anything, to make us well? And we were told, either there were nurses, or they were \u0152 I \u0152 I s \u0152 to this day I don\u2122t know who the people were who took care of us, that we have typhus fever. And nobody want to come near us, because they were afraid, the military, that they might get sick, too. There was one woman who had a daughter my age."

            "answer": "Yes, I was 20 years old at the time, yes, I \u0152 and there was one woman, as I say, and she spoke a little Russian. She ran out to get help, so we can go to a hospital. Soon after, a wagon with a German came, horse and wagon, and they put us all on a wagon, and supposingly we went to a hospital. But it wasn\u2122t a hospital, it was a school converted into a hospit al , because there were many other women from other areas, which I \u0152 I \u0152 I still don\u2122t know where they came from. And they put hay on the floor, and we were laying on the hay, with no pillows, with no nothing, but all we wanted is help. The Russians did a lot for us."

            "question": "A-Are you still near Gdansk , still, at the time?",
            "answer": "Yeah, that was, yes, near the area where I was liberated. I can\u2122t account the time, but after a while, they took us to another place, which was better than the hospital, Interview with Helen Schwartz March 1, 2010 5 the school hospital. And at that time we saw already Russian doctors, Russian nurses. But the Russians were so bitter, so upset, that they couldn\u2122t even \u0152 even stand if a German ca \u0152 if German woman or man came to help, to be on the same floor at the time when they were there. Because the Russians suffered a lot too, from the Germans. And supposingly , I have no idea, but we tried to figure out why the Russians were so mad at the Germans, that after, when we came back to ourselves, when we \u0152 we \u0152 we were sick for two months. So I cannot count the time when we felt better, but I assume maybe a month, maybe six weeks. We kept on asking why the Russians are so mad at the Germans. And they said, they killed our parents, our sisters, our brothers, just as much as they killed your sisters and brothers. But, after two months, we were released, and we were told \u0152 we were asked where we want to go. So I said, I want to go back to L\u00f3dz to find out who survived. And Red Cross took us over at the time, and they brought us back to L\u00f3dz . L\u00f3dz was just as bad as the place we came from, which, I don\u2122t know the name of the place, but was near Gdansk . We didn\u2122t have anybody, but I found a place which was for me to stay, with some other people. And every day we went to check the list of the people who survived, and who came from L\u00f3dz . So I found my sister and my brother also survived. But my sister came after to L\u00f3dz , but my brother remained in Germany because he was liberated by the Americans, and that Interview with Helen Schwartz March 1, 2010 6 was German territory. And where we were liberated was the Russian territory, because England , Russia , everybody took a p \u0152 a \u0152 a part of, I think the country. Shortly after I was reunited with my sister, because knowing \u0152 she probably checked the list where she was, I checked the list where I was, and we got reunited, so I was with my sister shortly after."

            "answer": "And that was still in L\u00f3dz, yes, and we couldn\u2122t get in touch with my brother, but people who I don\u2122t know what \u0152 they were not sick, or they were hiding, used to com \u0152 communicate, go places. So we sent the message, through this person, to my brother, who was in Ainring , near Feldafing , in Germany , that we both survive. We are only two sisters, and we survive. So he sent back a message with somebody, not letters, because at that time that was too early for mail, and it was such a mix-up that it\u2122s hard to describe, but everybody just want to know who survived. That was the most important thing. So the brother sent back the message, and he said, I survived and I am in this particular place, which was Ainring , by Freilassing . If you could, come back to Germany , so we can be all together. Shortly, when we felt we can travel, and the travel wasn\u2122t that you took a ticket and you went on the train, or \u0152 or airplane. What \u0152 travel, you had to find somebody who took you from one place to another, until we reached the border of Poland and Germany , and then Interview with Helen Schwartz March 1, 2010 7 somebody else would \u0152 took us to the place where my brother was. We \u0152 we \u0152 we did survive the trip, and we came back to Germany , which nobody liked to be in Germany , but we had no other choice, because we couldn\u2122t stay in pol \u0152 in portla \u0152 in \u0152 I\u2122m sorry, in portla \u0152 we couldn\u2122t stay in L\u00f3dz because nobody was there. And the place which we lived was torn down, because di \u0152 the place where we used to live was very close to the gates where the ghetto started in L\u00f3dz. So we reunited, and we stayed in Ainring , with my brother and my sister. We stayed there from \u212245 til I came to the United States in \u212249. There I met my husband, a nd we got married. My sister met her husband in the four years, and my brother got married. So we all got married in Germany , and from Germany , the first chance anybody had, they want to go away from Germany . So we all registered to America , to \u0152 to Canada , to Israel, and whichever came first, we \u0152 we went."

And he went to Canada . And we were supposed to go shortly after. Then, my sister and her husband went to Israel . And when they came to Israel, they came right into the war, because they came in \u212248, from \u0152 from the ship, my brother-in-law was taken to the army, and my sister was left all by herself, and very, very sick and discouraged, because we left one war, and came right into another war.

            "question": "But your brother and sister were older than you, or \u0152",
            "answer": "Yes, I was the youngest in the family, but I had a child the first. My child was born in \u212247. I married in \u212246, a year later I had my daughter. And with children, nobody was very happy to take. Israel didn\u2122t want anybody with children. They took only young people, because there was a war, and they wanted people to go to war with no children. And by that time, my brother was already in Canada . And he said, be patient, wait, and I\u2122m trying to get you to Canada . That was my brother. Meantime, there was a opening to the United States . And we were very happy. At the time, it was HIAS who was working to \u0152 to bring the people to the United States . But there was a nice family in Portland , Maine, which at that time I didn\u2122t even know what Maine was, and they needed somebody to work in a clothing factory, and my husband signed up as a tailor. So, we were chosen to go to Interview with Helen Schwartz March 1, 2010 9 Portland , Maine, and we were very, very happy. Came to Portland with a two and a half year old child. And the man who signed up for us to come to Portland , I \u0152 was one of the nicest people. He supplied us with an apartment. My husband was right away paid 40 some dollars a week, which I thought I am a millionaire, because 40 \u0152 40 some dollars at \u0152 in \u0152 in \u212249 was a lot of money. And we were very happy to be in America . So my sister was in Israel , my brother was in Canada , and I was in America . We were not happy about it, because we want to be together. So I was the one who was saying, I\u2122m going to start doing something. Maybe I can bring you to America . My sister said, oh I would like you to come to Israel, and my brother said, you \u0152 I would like you to be in Canada . But, it took a long time, and everybody already had settled in the places where they were, so my husband didn\u2122t want to leave Portland , Maine, and my sister didn\u2122t want to leave Israel , and my brother didn\u2122t want to leave Canada , so we were all separated. In Portland , I had a beautiful life. The people were so nice, and they were not all Jewish. Even the Gentile people, they accepted us like we were somebody special. They came \u0152 they was quite a few families who came to Portland , but they didn\u2122t stay on, because at that time, the people who came to Portland , they were single people. And for single people there wasn\u2122t really much to do in Portland . And the majority left, after a while. But three, four \u0152 four families were left in Portland, who had Interview with Helen Schwartz March 1, 2010 10 children. And I came in \u212249, in \u212251 my \u0152 my son was born in Portland . And I already had two children, and life was beautiful. And I realized what a beautiful place is to be in America . And as the years went by, I had another son, who was born in \u212257, and this was that, and we were all settled in Portland . After my \u0152 after five years, my husband worked for thi s ma n who signed it up for us. In gratitude, he didn\u2122t want to leave him, but he always want to be on his own. So, after five years, pay him back what this man did for us in Portland , we opened a little shop for ourselves, which was a tailoring, clothing, like Mom and Pop shop. And I helped my husband, and we were there for \u0152 for almost 40 years, until my husband took sick, and my husband died in 2000. After when I \u0152 and my kids, meantime got married and moved away from Portland . After 2000, I was left by myself, and very few friends in Portland . I stayed on for another year in Portland , in Maine, and my daughter who lived in Virginia at the time, said \u0152 and my son settled in New Jersey , and already had families, and my daughter had families. They ask me, where do I want to go to be again together? So I decide I\u2122m gonna come near my daughter. And near my daughter, I didn\u2122t want to be in a single home again, so I have chosen to be in Leisure World , which I have no regrets, I\u2122m very happy, and I made some new friends and I been living \u0152 it\u2122s been nine years since I came to live Interview with Helen Schwartz March 1, 2010 11 in Leisure World , and I hope, God willing, that I will h ave a few more years, and enjoy life in Leisure World ."

But before I was liberated, there were Poles who went \u0152 oh, I forget the name \u0152 which the Poles converted into Germans.

And I knew, I \u0152 I used to say, oh they speak Polish \u0152 because you expect the Germans to speak German. And at the very end, they said, whoever can f \u0152 hide, this was the last hide."
