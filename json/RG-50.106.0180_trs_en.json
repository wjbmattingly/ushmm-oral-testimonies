This is a post-Holocaust interview, and so | just wanted to give out some of your information first. You were born Hela Kirschner, April 8\", 1925, in L\u00e9dz, Poland. You were in the L\u00e9dz ghetto from 1939 to August 1944. Then you were in Auschwitz from August 1944, and then to Stutthof, to Proust, and many other places. And when you were on the march, towards the end of the war, you were liberated March, 1945, near Gdansk.",

            "question": "Okay. So let\u2019s talk now, what happened after that. What \u2014 where did you go after liberation?",
            "answer": "After the liberation, there was a small group of women, and we were liberated by the Russians. They took very good care of us, they supplied us with food, with clothes, because we were almost clothes-less. Nothing that we had on was a sack. No shoes, no nothing. The Russians supplied us with everything they could, but it didn\u2019t take us long \u2014 w-we stayed in a group, maybe eight or 10 women \u2014 girls mostly, young women. And must be we ate too much food, or the dirt, because we were invaded by \u2014 by lice, and two days, three days after, everybody fell sick. And by being sick, the Russians were afraid to come near us, and we didn\u2019t know what http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Helen Schwartz * March 1, 2010 was wrong with us, because we probably had high temperature, and none of the girls was probably normal, and didn\u2019t know what happening. But when the Russians didn\u2019t come near us, we kept on asking, why don\u2019t we get any help, or anything, to make us well? And we were told, either there were nurses, or they were \u2014 I\u2014 Is \u2014 to this day I don\u2019t know who the people were who took care of us, that we have typhus fever. And nobody want to come near us, because they were afraid, the military, that they might get sick, too. There was one woman who had a daughter my age."

            "answer": "Yes, I was 20 years old at the time, yes, I \u2014 and there was one woman, as I say, and she spoke a little Russian. She ran out to get help, so we can go to a hospital. Soon after, a wagon with a German came, horse and wagon, and they put us all ona wagon, and supposingly we went to a hospital. But it wasn\u2019t a hospital, it was a school converted into a hospital, because there were many other women from other areas, which I \u2014 I \u2014I still don\u2019t know where they came from. And they put hay on the floor, and we were laying on the hay, with no pillows, with no nothing, but all we wanted is help. The Russians did a lot for us."

            "question": "A-Are you still near Gdansk, still, at the time?",
            "answer": "Yeah, that was, yes, near the area where I was liberated. I can\u2019t account the time, but after a while, they took us to another place, which was better than the hospital, http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Helen Schwartz \u00b0 March 1, 2010 the school hospital. And at that time we saw already Russian doctors, Russian nurses. But the Russians were so bitter, so upset, that they couldn\u2019t even \u2014 even stand if a German ca \u2014 if German woman or man came to help, to be on the same floor at the time when they were there. Because the Russians suffered a lot too, from the Germans. And supposingly, I have no idea, but we tried to figure out why the Russians were so mad at the Germans, that after, when we came back to ourselves, when we \u2014 we \u2014 we were sick for two months. So I cannot count the time when we felt better, but I assume maybe a month, maybe six weeks. We kept on asking why the Russians are so mad at the Germans. And they said, they killed our parents, our sisters, our brothers, just as much as they killed your sisters and brothers. But, after two months, we were released, and we were told \u2014 we were asked where we want to go. So I said, I want to go back to Lodz to find out who survived. And Red Cross took us over at the time, and they brought us back to Lodz. L6\u00e9dz was just as bad as the place we came from, which, I don\u2019t know the name of the place, but was near Gdansk. We didn\u2019t have anybody, but I found a place which was for me to stay, with some other people. And every day we went to check the list of the people who survived, and who came from L\u00e9dz. So I found my sister and my brother also survived. But my sister came after to Lodz, but my brother remained in Germany because he was liberated by the Americans, and that http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Helen Schwartz \u00b0 March 1, 2010 was German territory. And where we were liberated was the Russian territory, because England, Russia, everybody took a p \u2014 a \u2014a part of, I think the country. Shortly after I was reunited with my sister, because knowing \u2014 she probably checked the list where she was, I checked the list where I was, and we got reunited, so I was with my sister shortly after."

So we sent the message, through this person, to my brother, who was in Ainring, near Feldafing, in Germany, that we both survive. We are only two sisters, and we survive. So he sent back a message with somebody, not letters, because at that time that was too early for mail, and 1t was such a mix-up that it\u2019s hard to describe, but everybody just want to know who survived. That was the most important thing. So the brother sent back the message, and he said, I survived and I am in this particular place, which was Ainring, by Freilassing. If you could, come back to Germany, so we can be all together. Shortly, when we felt we can travel, and the travel wasn\u2019t that you took a ticket and you went on the train, or \u2014 or airplane. What \u2014 travel, you had to find somebody who took you from one place to another, until we reached the border of Poland and Germany, and then http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Helen Schwartz ' March 1, 2010 somebody else would \u2014 took us to the place where my brother was. We \u2014 we \u2014 we did survive the trip, and we came back to Germany, which nobody liked to be in Germany, but we had no other choice, because we couldn\u2019t stay in pol \u2014 in portla \u2014 in \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, in portla \u2014 we couldn\u2019t stay in Lodz because nobody was there. And the place which we lived was torn down, because di \u2014 the place where we used to live was very close to the gates where the ghetto started in L6dz. So we reunited, and we stayed in Ainring, with my brother and my sister. We stayed there from \u201945 til I came to the United States in \u201949. There I met my husband, and we got married. My sister met her husband in the four years, and my brother got married. So we all got married in Germany, and from Germany, the first chance anybody had, they want to go away from Germany. So we all registered to America, to \u2014 to Canada, to Israel, and whichever came first, we \u2014 we went."

            "answer": "Yes, I was the youngest in the family, but I had a child the first. My child was born in \u00b047. I married in \u201946, a year later I had my daughter. And with children, nobody was very happy to take. Israel didn\u2019t want anybody with children. They took only young people, because there was a war, and they wanted people to go to war with no children. And by that time, my brother was already in Canada. And he said, be patient, wait, and I\u2019m trying to get you to Canada. That was my brother. Meantime, there was a opening to the United States. And we were very happy. At the time, it was HIAS who was working to \u2014 to bring the people to the United States. But there was a nice family in Portland, Maine, which at that time I didn\u2019t even know what Maine was, and they needed somebody to work in a clothing factory, and my husband signed up as a tailor. So, we were chosen to go to Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Helen Schwartz \u201d March 1, 2010 Portland, Maine, and we were very, very happy. Came to Portland with a two and a half year old child. And the man who signed up for us to come to Portland, I \u2014 was one of the nicest people. He supplied us with an apartment. My husband was right away paid 40 some dollars a week, which I thought I am a millionaire, because 40 \u2014 40 some dollars at \u2014 in \u2014 in 49 was a lot of money. And we were very happy to be in America. So my sister was in Israel, my brother was in Canada, and I was in America. We were not happy about it, because we want to be together. So I was the one who was saying, I\u2019m going to start doing something. Maybe I can bring you to America. My sister said, oh I would like you to come to Israel, and my brother said, you \u2014 I would like you to be in Canada. But, it took a long time, and everybody already had settled in the places where they were, so my husband didn\u2019t want to leave Portland, Maine, and my sister didn\u2019t want to leave Israel, and my brother didn\u2019t want to leave Canada, so we were all separated. In Portland, I had a beautiful life. The people were so nice, and they were not all Jewish. Even the Gentile people, they accepted us like we were somebody special. They came \u2014 they was quite a few families who came to Portland, but they didn\u2019t stay on, because at that time, the people who came to Portland, they were single people. And for single people there wasn\u2019t really much to do in Portland. And the majority left, after a while. But three, four \u2014 four families were left in Portland, who had Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Helen Schwartz \" March 1, 2010 children. And I came in \u00b049, in \u201951 my \u2014 my son was born in Portland. And I already had two children, and life was beautiful. And I realized what a beautiful place is to be in America. And as the years went by, I had another son, who was born in \u201957, and this was that, and we were all settled in Portland. After my \u2014 after five years, my husband worked for this man who signed it up for us. In gratitude, he didn\u2019t want to leave him, but he always want to be on his own. So, after five years, pay him back what this man did for us in Portland, we opened a little shop for ourselves, which was a tailoring, clothing, like Mom and Pop shop. And I helped my husband, and we were there for \u2014 for almost 40 years, until my husband took sick, and my husband died in 2000. After when I \u2014 and my kids, meantime got married and moved away from Portland. After 2000, I was left by myself, and very few friends in Portland. I stayed on for another year in Portland, in Maine, and my daughter who lived in Virginia at the time, said \u2014 and my son settled in New Jersey, and already had families, and my daughter had families. They ask me, where do I want to go to be again together? So I decide I\u2019m gonna come near my daughter. And near my daughter, I didn\u2019t want to be in a single home again, so I have chosen to be in Leisure World, which I have no regrets, I\u2019m very happy, and I made some new friends and I been living \u2014 it\u2019s been nine years since I came to live Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Helen Schwartz \" March 1, 2010 in Leisure World, and I hope, God willing, that I will have a few more years, and enjoy life in Leisure World."

That\u2019s why Poles \u2014 and my husband felt the same way, Poles were just as bad as the Germans, maybe even worse in it \u2014 in some instances. But before I was liberated, there were Poles who went \u2014 oh, I forget the name \u2014 which the Poles converted into Germans. And they went \u2014 and they were helping the Germans, and they were soldiers. So I had a \u2014 a easy time before the liberation, that one of the Poles \u2014 and I knew, because I could hear the Polish language from far away. We never were close to anybody. And I knew, I \u2014 I used to say, oh they speak Polish \u2014 because you expect the Germans to speak German. And at the very end, they said, whoever can f \u2014 hide, this was the last hide."

So, they said in Polish, whoever can hide, well, it won\u2019t do any good to say it in Polish, but they said it. And that\u2019s all I heard about them, but they were worse.
