And they said, you know, if you have a \u0152 a child, just, you know, throw her out, like bring her out. So I remembered like they picked me up physically and brought me to the gate. By that time the Germans were already \u0152 they were on their way to come to liquidate the ghetto. And she was waiting for me, she took me by the hand like this, and we st arted walking, just walking. And I \u0152 I don\u2122t know, I was just very pliable, I guess, and this time I just went with her. And in fact, on the way \u0152 on the way, as we were walking, we were caught by the Ukrainian police, and we were taken into a pla \u0152 a room, and I remember sitting with her, just like today, like she was sitting and I was sitting. And the policeman was called away for some reason. There was a woman scrubbing the floor and she said, what are you sitting here? Go. He\u2122s not here, get out of here.

We came to her brother, and I remember she put me up like in a part where, you know, nobody could see me. And I was there for maybe a week or so, I don\u2122t know how long either, because I ha ve no \u0152 I had no perception of time whatsoever.
