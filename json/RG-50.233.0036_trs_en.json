So the Jews had to wear the Jewish stars, even children. And then the non-Jews were not allowed to sell to Jews or aid them in any way. You see they gave, when the Germans came already, Pll tell you, I don\u2019t blame the non, at that time, you know I read now, I know there were some very righteous non-Jews that really, what they did, I don\u2019t know if I would do it today when I have children and grandchildren because would they aid a Jew, they would be taken away to a concentration camp. So the punishment was so tremendous of aiding a Jew that he himself wasn\u2019t safe. I\u2019m talking the non-Jew wasn\u2019t safe. That was by the Germans, by the Germans."

But, the living quarters, the ghetto was a brick factory, they emptied out a brick factory, it was big. There were no beds or kitchens in a brick factory, so we brought some blankets with us, you know we carried certain things and they gave us a little place there in the ghetto where we stayed, where we had our little place on the floor.

It was like this, and it says \u201cArbeit macht das Leben suss\u201d\u2019, and that means in English, work makes life sweet. So, but still the smell was terrible, the smell was terrible and there was a big fire, like a big building or something was on fire. You could see far in from the tracks, but they didn\u2019t open up the wagons until it got completely dark, I mean it was dark, dark. All of a sudden floodlights came on the train and we saw these SS there on the platform, you know, and dogs, dogs. And they opened up the doors and started screaming, \u201cHeraus! Heraus! Heraus!\u201d\u2019 And, you know from that trip a lot of people died because they threw in sick people and old people and so whoever could run out from this train, they were going out. If not you were beaten up. So they rushed so that they shouldn\u2019t get beaten, but a lot of them that stayed there they just carried them out and put them on the truck. There was a truck, a big open truck, was right there, you know, not far from the platform. Everybody tried taking out the few things that they had for them, not that it was anything but, everybody is trying to survive, so they think they\u2019 ll be needing it.  So there was a ditch and they were yelling at the people they should throw away the luggage, and people didn\u2019t want to part with it. One was screaming \u201cI don\u2019t have the name on it!\u201d They were worrying that they\u2019Il never find their luggage 13 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection because they don\u2019t have the name on it. So there was sort of a commotion, so they were hitting on the people and they got beaten up, they threw away those few little things that they had there. But, with my grandfather he didn\u2019t want it, he was getting beaten up, but he wouldn\u2019t part with it. And so, you know what they did to him. Should I repeat, should I say it again?"

And what I remember seeing 1s that they just took my grandfather and they threw him on the truck because he couldn\u2019t get up anymore and the Torah, the Ten Commandments were in the ditch.

So, they were beating on my mother, she fell and she was crawling and pleading with the SS, \u201cPlease let me go to my kid! Please let me go to my kid!\u201d\u2019 So, finally after she was on the floor and pleading with him and, I don\u2019t know, change of heart, he kicked her and she went to the left. You know, he kicked her and she sort of moved to the left. She ran to my brother and she got a hold of him, and, you know, my brother cried anyway because he saw my mother so beaten up. And they walked off, Pll tell you the truth, you know, when I think if, sometimes, moments I said, I bet my mother would survive. But, right after the war I knew she would have not survived anyway, so I say to myself maybe a good thing that happened, you know there were so many kids they went to their death so frightened, so scared because they didn\u2019t have their parents with them. Now, the little infants, they didn\u2019t know, but the four, five, six year old child, it was dark, it was dark. In the beating, you know, they were hitting on children. You would think they would leave children alone. If the child, let\u2019s say didn\u2019t obey what they said, if 1t wanted to go here or there they were they were hitting on kids like they hit on adults. And why they needed to do that I don\u2019t understand, why they needed to hit on kids. And, so I say to myself, maybe she was a comfort to another child there, I\u2019m sure. You know, she had seven kids and, so ---- so that\u2019s how my mother left to her death.  14 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

She would do a lot of work for me that, you know, I could not work so hard, she just --- But, in the end, I remember in the end, you know, she said she\u2019s not going to leave me here alone. She would get angry at me, she would get angry at me because I say, \u201cI\u2019m going to die\u201d. You know, to her it was a threat.
