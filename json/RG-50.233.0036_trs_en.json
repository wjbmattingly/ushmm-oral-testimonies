When we stopped in Auschwitz they didn\u2122t open up the door, we didn\u2122t know where we were. We just saw a big si gn that said, you know, a round sign. It was like this, and it says \ufb01Arbeit macht das Le ben suss\ufb02, and that means in English, work makes life sweet. So, but still the smell was terrible, the smell was terrible and there was a big fire, like a big building or something was on fire. You could see far in from the tracks, but they didn\u2122t open up the wagons until it got completely dark, I mean it was dark, dark. All of a sudden floodlights came on the train and we saw these SS there on the platform, you know, and dogs, dogs. And they opened up the doors and started screaming, \ufb01Heraus! Heraus! Heraus!\ufb02 And, you know from that trip a lot of pe ople died because they threw in sick people and old people and so whoever could run out from this train, they were going out. If not you were beaten up. So they rushed so that they shouldn\u2122t get beaten, but a lot of them that stayed ther e they just carried them out and put them on the truck. There was a truck, a big open truck, was right there, you know, not far from the platform. Everybody tried taki ng out the few things that they had for them, not that it was anything but, everybody is trying to survive, so they think they\u2122ll be needing it. So there was a ditch and they were yelling at the people they should throw away the luggage, and people didn\u2122t want to part with it. One was screaming \ufb01I don\u2122t have the name on it!\ufb02 They were worryi ng that they\u2122ll never find their luggage 14because they don\u2122t have the name on it. So there was sort of a commotion, so they were hitting on the people and they got beaten up, they threw away those few little things that they had there. But, with my grandfather he didn\u2122t want it, he was getting beaten up, but he wouldn\u2122t part with it. And so, you know what they did to him. Should I repeat, should I say it again?"

Throw it away!\ufb02 He didn\u2122t want to do it, so they beat him, they kicked him and then he could no longer get up. He was there and then they were beating on us to go to the right, to the left. And what I remember seeing is that they just took my grandfather and they threw him on the truck because he couldn\u2122t get up anymore and the Torah, the Ten Commandme nts were in the ditch. And me and my sister they put us to ride with my mother and my mother held on to my brother, she wouldn\u2122t let go of him."

But, she didn\u2122t know that they\u2122re going to put him to the left, that they\u2122re going to put him on the other side and my brother sc reamed and cried and there were other cries from other children. But, she sort of, she must have recognized his cry so she looked back and, you know, he was trying to go to my mother, so they were hitting on him and so my mother ran to hi m from the right to the left and they wouldn\u2122t let her go to the left. So, they were beating on my mother, she fell and she was crawling and pleading with the SS, \ufb01Please let me go to my kid! Please let me go to my kid!\ufb02 So, finally after she was on the floor and pleading with him and, I don\u2122t know, change of heart, he kicked her and she went to the left. You know, he kicked her and she sort of moved to the left. She ran to my brother and she got a hold of him, and, you know, my brother cried anyway because he saw my mother so beaten up. And they wa lked off, I\u2122ll tell you the truth, you know, when I think if, sometimes, moments I said, I bet my mother would survive. But, right after the war I knew she would have not survived anyway, so I say to myself maybe a good thing that happened, you know there were so many kids they went to their death so frightened, so scared b ecause they didn\u2122t have their parents with them. Now, the little infants, they di dn\u2122t know, but the four, five, six year old child, it was dark, it was dark. In the beating, you know, they were hitting on children. You would think they would leave children alone. If the child, let\u2122s say didn\u2122t obey what they said, if it wanted to go here or there they were they were hitting on kids like they hit on adults. And why they needed to do that I don\u2122t understand, why they needed to hit on kids. And, so I say to myself, maybe she was a comfort to another child there, I\u2122m sure. You know, she had seven kids and, so ---- so that\u2122s how my mother left to her death. 15"

You never saw them again, they probably, you know, we just never ---nobody asked. We never saw them again. They probably just did aw ay with them. So, I would want to do that and she would lift me up and she shook me in the morning. She dragged me out, but it was cold, you see where we we re in Germany it was very cold and, here, you know, we had these wooden shoes and the one dress. So, she would drag me out to stay there for an hour, you know, and she would encourage me, she would give me, you know half a slice of her half slice of bread so that I should just go on, go on. She would do a lot of work for me that, you know, I could not work so hard, she just --- Bu t, in the end, I remember in the end, you know, she said she\u2122s not going to leave me here alone. She would get angry at me, she would get angry at me because I say, \ufb01I\u2122m going to die\ufb02. You know, to her it was a threat. To me it was real, me ntally, with me In think my mental stage gave up so ---you know, I don\u2122t care anymore, so if not for her I probably wouldn\u2122t be sitting here and talking."
