He had no fear of death because he was so religious. He felt he goes to, you know. I remember in the ghetto when they took him to the square. More older people that had beards. He had a long beard, not just a small beard, but a long beard. He never got cut his beard because of religion. So, they got these old men on the square and they were cutting their beards with scissors and they were beating on him. So um, you know he was bloody and my mother was the daughter, so my mother finally got to him. You couldn\u2019t go to rescue him because you would get shot. I mean you wouldn\u2019t get beaten up, you would get shot. So she couldn\u2019t go rescue, but when they were finished beating him up and cutting his beard, we brought him home and he was just crying terribly and we thought he was crying because he was full of pain. You know, his face was bloody and black and after a few days the man just couldn\u2019t stop crying so, uh we told him we understand he must be in terrible pain from the blows he got. He says no, he doesn\u2019t cry out of pain but he, it\u2019s not him, he felt so humiliated. So my mother took a scarf and she put around his face and tied it on the top and put 2 his hat on, he wore a black hat and somehow that made him feel better. He stopped crying. So, so. And that\u2019s how he went to Auschwitz a few days later."

But, the living quarters, the ghetto was a brick factory, they emptied out a brick factory, it was big. There were no beds or kitchens in a brick factory, so we brought some blankets with us, you know we carried certain things and they gave us a little place there in the ghetto where we stayed, where we had our little place on the floor. Then they gave us rations, soup, you know, in the morning coffee, and at night soup. Of course the living quarters were horrible, there was no place to wash and the kids, there were no bathrooms.

When we stopped in Auschwitz they didn\u2019t open up the door, we didn\u2019t know where we were. We just saw a big sign that said, you know, a round sign. It was like this, and it says \u201cArbeit macht das Leben suss\u201d\u2019, and that means in English, work makes life sweet. So, but still the smell was terrible, the smell was terrible and there was a big fire, like a big building or something was on fire. You could see far in from the tracks, but they didn\u2019t open up the wagons until it got completely dark, I mean it was dark, dark. All of a sudden floodlights came on the train and we saw these SS there on the platform, you know, and dogs, dogs. And they opened up the doors and started screaming, \u201cHeraus! Heraus! Heraus!\u201d\u2019 And, you know from that trip a lot of people died because they threw in sick people and old people and so whoever could run out from this train, they were going out. If not you were beaten up. So they rushed so that they shouldn\u2019t get beaten, but a lot of them that stayed there they just carried them out and put them on the truck. There was a truck, a big open truck, was right there, you know, not far from the platform. Everybody tried taking out the few things that they had for them, not that it was anything but, everybody is trying to survive, so they think they\u2019 ll be needing it. So there was a ditch and they were yelling at the people they should throw away the luggage, and people didn\u2019t want to part with it. One was screaming \u201cI don\u2019t have the name on it!\u201d They were worrying that they\u2019Il never find their luggage 13 because they don\u2019t have the name on it. So there was sort of a commotion, so they were hitting on the people and they got beaten up, they threw away those few little things that they had there. But, with my grandfather he didn\u2019t want it, he was getting beaten up, but he wouldn\u2019t part with it. And so, you know what they did to him. Should I repeat, should I say it again?"

And what I remember seeing 1s that they just took my grandfather and they threw him on the truck because he couldn\u2019t get up anymore and the Torah, the Ten Commandments were in the ditch. And me and my sister they put us to ride with my mother and my mother held on to my brother, she wouldn\u2019t let go of him."

But, she sort of, she must have recognized his cry so she looked back and, you know, he was trying to go to my mother, so they were hitting on him and so my mother ran to him from the right to the left and they wouldn\u2019t let her go to the left. So, they were beating on my mother, she fell and she was crawling and pleading with the SS, \u201cPlease let me go to my kid! Please let me go to my kid!\u201d\u2019 So, finally after she was on the floor and pleading with him and, I don\u2019t know, change of heart, he kicked her and she went to the left. You know, he kicked her and she sort of moved to the left. She ran to my brother and she got a hold of him, and, you know, my brother cried anyway because he saw my mother so beaten up. And they walked off, Pll tell you the truth, you know, when I think if, sometimes, moments I said, I bet my mother would survive. But, right after the war I knew she would have not survived anyway, so I say to myself maybe a good thing that happened, you know there were so many kids they went to their death so frightened, so scared because they didn\u2019t have their parents with them. Now, the little infants, they didn\u2019t know, but the four, five, six year old child, it was dark, it was dark. In the beating, you know, they were hitting on children. You would think they would leave children alone. If the child, let\u2019s say didn\u2019t obey what they said, if 1t wanted to go here or there they were they were hitting on kids like they hit on adults. And why they needed to do that I don\u2019t understand, why they needed to hit on kids. And, so I say to myself, maybe she was a comfort to another child there, I\u2019m sure. You know, she had seven kids and, so ---- so that\u2019s how my mother left to her death. 14"

So, I didn\u2019t want to get up in the morning and these people, that they didn\u2019t get up in the morning, they were left in the barracks when we worked. You never saw them again, they probably, you know, we just never ---nobody asked. We never saw them again. They probably just did away with them. So, I would want to do that and she would lift me up and she shook me in the morning. She dragged me out, but 1t was cold, you see where we were in Germany it was very cold and, here, you know, we had these wooden shoes and the one dress. So, she would drag me out to stay there for an hour, you know, and she would encourage me, she would give me, you know half a slice of her half slice of bread so that I should just go on, go on. She would do a lot of work for me that, you know, I could not work so hard, she just --- But, in the end, I remember in the end, you know, she said she\u2019s not going to leave me here alone. She would get angry at me, she would get angry at me because I say, \u201cI\u2019m going to die\u201d. You know, to her it was a threat. To me it was real, mentally, with me In think my mental stage gave up So ---you know, I don\u2019t care anymore, so if not for her I probably wouldn\u2019t be sitting here and talking."
