What happened after that and at that point, did you know where the rest of your family was and did you have any contact with them?",
            "answer": "My family was, my whole fa mily was in Hamburg. My brothe r who had run away from Bremen had also come to Hamburg. My sister, as I mentioned before, had been working with the family in Hamburg, so they we re all in Hamburg."

            "answer": "My father was also in Hamburg. After, about a week or so after the Shiva, my father and I returned to Bremen and we were living in the same house where we had lived before. We were searching the house and we found the bullet which had killed my mother and we found everything upside-down, we put the wh ole house in order and we were livi ng there and repairing as much as possible. In addition we tried to emigrate and find a place where to emigrate."

            "question": "And what were the re sults of that effort?",
            "answer": "We had written to several people before, but the answers were usually, we have no money, we have no place, we like to help you, but we can' t. Now after Kristallnacht, which was on November ninth to the 10th, 1938 of November , we wrote again to these people and we told them about my mother and especially my father 's cousin, who was living in York town(ph), Saskatchewan, if he could do anything about it. This time we got a lett er from him, that he woul d talk to the member of Parliament in Canada and find how to get us specia l permission. And he woul d then send us what is called a landing card, that we were allowed to land. After a few w eeks, we got this landing card. 2 Now the question was to leave Germany. You needed fi rst of all, permissi on from the German government and they would be there when we would pack our things. But first of all we had to get tickets to go to Canada. My father went to the Norstorchalloit(ph) , which is a shipping company in Germany, and they said, since the Germans wanted us to take a German comp any, they told us they were all booked up for two years. We did not want to wait for two years, so my father went to Hamburg again and Hamburg had th at, Hamburg had a connection with British Airline, with the British, not airline, with the British shipping line, the Koolnot(ph) Whitestar(p h) line and he met a man from there and he said he would get us passag e to Canada. However, to get there, we needed first to go by ferry boat, from Hamburg to England and from E ngland to Southampton, we would take a boat to Canada. When the landing cart came, we gave it to him and he prepared us and he arranged for all the necessary things in order for us to travel to Canada. We were traveling five people, my father, myself, my two brothers and my sister. But we needed money for the tickets. In order to do this, we had to sell our house. Now there was one woma n, ____ woman, who the Nazi's had planted into our house, she wanted to buy it. Of course she bo ught it with very little money, just enough money to pay for the tic kets. So we had the tickets and we set our date, I mean in fact the date was set by the shipping company, for May 31, 1939. On that day we would leave Germany with the ferry boat. Many other things happened between December and May, 1939. For instance, one thing which happened was in January, 1939. On the 18th of January, which was the Kaiser's birthday, before Hitler came to power, I got it, I was visiting a friend of ours, the family Greenberg(ph) and just about 10 o'clock I got a telegram which sa id, \"Come to Berlin.\" I didn't know originally from whom it ca me, but it came from a friend of mine who was working with a Jewish organization, the same I had been working for and I knew that I would go to Berlin and go to this organization. He said to me, my, the family I was working, I was visiting, said to me, \"Go there 3 right away.\" So it was 10 o'clock in the evening, I went to the train station and the next train was going at 12 at night, so I took that night train. But it was a very uncomfortable trip because there were the Nazis walking in and out and I didn't want to be recognized as a Jew at that time, so I walked around the train. It was what we call a expr ess train, where there is a hallway at the side and then there are cabins in there. So next morning, about seven o'clock, I arrived in Berlin, it wasn't my first time in Berlin. It was a very rainy day an d a dark day and I just started to walk. I came to the Brandenberger(ph) gate, which I had not seen for, at all, only in pictures before and there was a sign that Jews enter this at their own risk and Je ws are forbidden to enter this, but I walked very quickly through, there was no one re ally watching me and I walked to this pl ace of our organization, I came to the fourth floor and I saw some friends of mine, they said yes, thank you for coming, we are waiting you, the Nazis have told us that if we make out certain affidavits, which were fake of course, that our friends, young pe ople you see, would have a chance to go to Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, to the Baltic states and they would go there on Hashera(ph), Hashera(ph) means preparation for emigration to Israel. Then they would recognize us and they wo uld go there. So the whole day we were typing out, with the type machine, of course they had no electric typing machines at that time, we were typing ou t letters with names and birthdays and we said that they had permission, they were accepted to the Hashera(ph) in Latvia, I still have some letters in my files, and we gave them to the Nazis, about 200 people or so were fr eed from concentration camp and they came out. However, not everyone of these 200 people or so survived, becaus e afterwards the Nazis conquered Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania a nd you see and then they came into their hands, but some of them might have. So that was in January."

            "answer": "It was a Jewish organization ca lled Agoutis(ph) Israel and they were trying, like everyone else, trying to get Jews out. Sometimes you could fi nd a Nazi who was a little bit softer and her would accept such a fake document, you see they knew that it was fake, everyone kn ew it was fake, because especially the South Amer ican countries, Latin American countries were working very much with fake and with money, bribes and so forth, becau se I went to the South American diplomats very many times and they said to me, \"Giv e us 400 dollars or so on, so much and we will let you out.\" So I went, oh we d on't do it, go to that company, to that country and they were all working together. Many times that's what happene d and you know this from your history, people went out and they were not permitted in that country because they said we don't, these are illegal certificates, and they had to be sent back, like it happened with many coun tries. But the Nazi's were very smart and they recogni zed the Jew, as I mentioned once before, in the class you see, either by the nose, or by the ears or by the color of the hair or by th e form of the he ad, because they measured them all."

They had such an organization in Bremen, where I was living at th at time, you see and it was at first a Zionist organization with which I was affiliated, however, I separated from them, because of religious reasons and then there was a special teacher in Bremen, who taught us, a Hebrew teacher and he was from this organization, from Ag outis(ph) Israel and I joined him. So I was already affiliated with this organization."

It was a question of assim ilation. It was a question of assimilation, emancipation. That's why the Zionist organizations, they were more of the type of uniting with the others and of so forth, where as this one was mo re individualized, by themselves."

            "question": "So you went back to Bremen?",
            "answer": "I went back to Bremen. Now one day it ha ppened, we were always afraid, especially at nighttime that they may knock at the door and take us away and it ha ppened one day, I think in, also in January one day they came, an ominous knock at the door in the middle of the night. My brother who were, had, one of my brothers , who had remained in Hamburg and they had sent him to the Jewish hospital in Hamburg. First he was in Sachsenhausen and from Sa chsenhausen, somehow, they arranged with the Hamburg, I don't know who, how, but he was in the Jewish hospital in Hamburg. So one night, they knocked at the d oor and I looked out of the window and I made myself not known, but they contin ued knocking and I said, \"What ca n I lose?\" I go downstairs, I open up. I didn't want to disturb my father, so I went downstairs, I opened up and he came in, not in Nazi uniform, but in plain uniform, civil uniform an d he said to him, we have here a search warrant for your brother, Benu(ph) , his name. I said to them, \"Don't y ou know that he is in the hospital in Hamburg?\" He made as if he didn't know anythin g, see, but come in and look through. They came through, they put upside-down the be ds and this and they're all corn er and then in the end I said, \"You should have known that he is in Hamburg in the hospital.\" He said, \"Yeah, excuse me\" and they left. But they came in and they made a person scared, yo u know. They could always come in, 8 middle of the night and knock at th e door. I went every morning, about six or seven o'clock, with a bicycle, we had a bicycle, to the synagogue, which was about, by bicycle, 15 minutes away, 20 minutes away and sometimes Nazis saw me, but I di dn't mind. So this was 1939, in January. In February, the congregation in Bremen, the Jewish congregation in Bremen, organized itself again and they had a temporary president, vice-president an d, but they had no place any more to live, so there was this one family, I mentioned before th is family Greenberg(ph) that was a different, a brother of this Greenberg and they had a house in Bremen and they had alre ady left this house in September 1938 and they had sold it, not even sold it, they had given it as a donation to the Bremen congregation. I met him later on in New York. But this was a house in the old city and there were maybe 20 families living in this house now, besides that's the office of the congre gation, was also in this house and we organized it. So we re-organ ized it, the congregation, you made a few things. Number one, I worked with the HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society a nd made translations, I knew a little bit of Englis h, not too much. Number two, we organized some courses for women in sewing and other things like this. Number three, there was a neighborhood congregation in Weisaminda(ph), which is near Bremerhaven(ph), that wanted some people to come and talk to them, so I went there sometimes a nd talked to them. Number four , we wanted to make a Jewish school again because the children did not go to schoo l. I can speak about this later. And, besides this, number five, they wanted a person from the Jewish community to be a contact ____, going to the Gestapo maybe once, twice, or maybe thre e times a week and tell them about what was happening in the congre gation, so I was elected, appointed. So I we nt there many times."

            "question": "Were you and your father living in this Jewish house, comm unity house now?",
            "answer": "No, we did not live in this Jewish community house, we lived in our own house, but many people had no house any more, especially people from the small communities outside, you see. 9 Many people in Germany, most people, most Jews in Germany, did not live in the big cities, they lived in small hamlets, how do you call it, villages and they came then to the bigger cities to be safer. So they appointed me a nd I went to the Gestapo and I never knew whether I would come out because _____ Gestapo was a big building which had no sign outside. You didn't know that it was a Gestapo building. It was in a section of Bremen , they had and Bremen was a medieval city and it had a trench around it and around the trench was a street which was called Amvahl(ph), it means _____ in the war, there used to be war in medi eval Germany, the cities had a wall around it and when I came there I had to push a button on top and the door would open and I would go in. And when I went in, there was a big picture, a man with two fingers on his lips that said silence, schweigne(ph), quiet. And then someone would tell me, \"Come upstai rs.\" I didn't know who it was, but I went upstairs. So I went upstairs, I went into this office and it was all clattered around with all kinds of things and this man was sitti ng there and his name was Mr. Parchman, I still remember that P-a-r-c-h-m-a-n and he was nobod y, an illiterate person _____. And he said to me, \"Sit down.\" Of course they addre ss the Jews as Uder(ph) in German and they were very, very rude. Sit down. Then he took out and I remember the first time I came, he took out a bunch of pictures and papers and he said to me, \"These are the pictures and pape rs which we rescued from your house.\" Rescued, you know. Was not rescued, they confiscated it. I said, \"Can I have them?\" So he gave me a little bit, not everything."

            "num": 20,
            "question": "Why were th ey so nice?",
            "answer": "They did not want to be comp lete, you see, every person, even the worst person in the world, sometimes has a soft moment. So he also had a soft moment at one ti me. He gave me a little bit, but what I asked him then, most of the time when I went to him, I asked him, \"Can you get this person and this person,\" I've got a few names of people from the Jewish congregation who were in 10 concentration camp, \"I want this person to get out , can you get him out, will you let him out?\" And that was the main purpose in the fi rst part of my contacts with them, to save people, to let them out of concentration camps. Someti mes he let them out, but not very many times, he said, \"What's he going to do, where's he going to go,\" so forth. The second part of my contact with the Gestapo was to have permission to make a Jewish school, because the children didn't have any more school, they were forbidden to go in German school, even in Jewi sh school, no schools. So what do we want to teach them in the schools? I want to teach th em how to leave Germany as quick as possible, because that's what you want. So what would he teach them ? I will teach them English and geography and certain things which they might be able to use afte r the emigrate and also I will teach, I will give them a little bit of exercise, gymnastics or so, you see th ey have to be strong when they leave. So they went on, they said, \"We have no place fo r German children and besides,\" says, \"when do you want to te ach the children?\" In the morning you are not allowed to teach them, he told me, because then German child ren are being taught and German children cannot be taught at the same time when Jewish children are being taught and the other way around. So I, I negotiated with him for a long time and he didn' t want to give us a Je wish school or a place, then I said to him, \"What about a place,\" and I found a place, \"near, near that hotel there, no one is there, it's not a school building, but it could be used as a schoo l building and we can use it in the afternoon.\" \"When do you want to teach the ch ildren, what time? Because th e German children go to school until three-thirty in the afternoon, you can only teach them from four until ab out six or six-thirty.\" I said, \"Okay.\" So finally he agreed and we had this place to take the Jewish children. Now I made a list of Jewish children, we had abou t 40 Jewish children at that time, boys and girls in all ages, up to 15 or 16 years of age and some of them came from smal l villages outside. But the question was teachers, we had no teachers. So I knew some merchant s, you see and I said to them, you teach him 11 this, you teach him this and I'll tell you what to do. So we, we had a few te achers, you see and they were not trained teachers, but I said the school shou ld not be like a very slow, a very low elementary school, but more like a middle school or so, like a little bit higher school and that's what it was. So the school opened on April 12th, 1939. We left Germany in May 1939, end of May, May 31, 1939, so I was there just two months, but during that time, I hired a teacher, one of my, one of my colleagues from ______ seminary, wh ere he was, had learned to be a teacher and he became my successor and the school stayed until about 1941, I think, when all the Jews were in Bremen, were sent to Minsk and Pinsk, in concentration camps."

That's why all the time, they were still a little bit reluctant to do things so openly, because they didn't want the worl d, the press to know about that, that they do do it openly. They wanted the world to know and to fear that whatever they did is by law. Therefore they made a law, Jews cannot go to school any more. They ma de a law, lawyers cannot have practice in here any more and things like th is, they wanted to do everything by law."

Some people tried to slip in certain things, but I was afraid to put in anything else. I wanted to put in some newspapers from Germany, where they spoke about the Nazis, one paper I put in, about there was a law that Jews we re only allowed to have certain names and my name was not Jewish enough and therefore I had to add the name Isra el. Girls and women, who had no Jewish name, a ccording to them it was not a Jewish name, had to put in Sarah. My sister Elisa(ph), Elisa(ph) Sarah. My br other's name, Abraham was not a Jewish name, Abraham Israel.

You sign in and you sign out. You sign out, so you had to sign out before you left Germany and go to the police and fill out that you signe d out. So I went to the police and I said, we are leaving on May 31st, I want to sign out. He said to me, \"Fill out this form.\" Filled out the form and he said, \"But y ou didn't fill out your addres s where you're going to move to.\" I said to him, \"I don't know it yet.\" So he said to me, \"Never mind, we Nazis will soon conquer the whole world and we will find you th ere anyhow.\" And they were really sure of themselves, that that would happen, you see?

After that time, we all got se asick, especially me, 21 because the North Sea is a very rough sea and we were supposed to be there on, when was it, Thursday evening, but we didn't ge t there until Friday morning. And we landed, we landed in a little village in England, Grimsby, Grimsby, G-r-i-m-s-b-y, it's a little bay, Grimsby Bay, it's in central Britain, I think and we went there, we landed there and the, the company, the ship company had made arrangements that from there they would pick us up by train and bring us to London over the weekend and a Sunday we would continue from Southampton. We landed in Grimsby, England and we went out and I think we took a hack out, spent our fi rst money and then we took the, we were late to a train, British train and very fast, went all the way do wn to London and in London, the current Whitestar(ph) line had a bus for us, I th ink us and other passenge rs who would be going from Southampton and showed us around London, saw the tower, the financial district, etcetera. And then they brought us to a hote l, a kosher hotel, this was the fi rst time since 1933 that we had meat again, because the meat was forbidden in Ge rmany. _____, the ____ was forbidden, right? One of the first laws that Hitler made in 1933. So and we had a good meal there, in the hotel and also there was a synagogue nearby , which was bombed out later, on th e ____, it's called the Great Synagogue and we saw that at that time. And on the day of Sabbath, the Shabbat, we went for a walk, it was in east end in London, east end I think it's called and no t far from the tower bridge, we went to the tower bridge and we maybe walked over there, I don't remember.

So we left at three o'clock, I even made a poem about it, May 31st of 1939, the sky wa s clear and heaven fine, to make believe here governs right, but it was not so. So we went on this boat and it was su pposed to be 10 days to come to Montreal, Canada, but it took 14 or 15 days becau se in summer, the boat goes further north and that's a shorter way, supposed to be, on the globe, but about in a few days later, we came into the section of the icebergs, because we went too far north and the boa t was standing still for two or three days in the ocean, in the Atlantic Ocean and we saw many things, we c ouldn't go up any more, because there were fish jumping over the boat, all right, that's not of importance, but we were all a little bit seasick, not as much as on the North Sea and then we came to, finall y, passing by Labrador and ... End of Tape 1 23 Tape 2 ",
                " I just talked about our trip from England to Canada and that we were kept for three days in the ocean, because of nearing the icebergs. So finall y we came to, past Newfoundland, Labrador, we came into the Saint Lawrence River, the big river in Canada, to bring us to Montreal. We first stopped in Quebec and in Quebec, so meone came to the, to the ship in, from a Jewish agency and told us that he would expect us in Montreal and th en bring us directly to our destinatio n. Now most of the other Jewish people who we re on the boat, knew where they w ould be going, they knew they would be going to relatives whom they knew al ready, in Montreal, or not far away. And these relatives would be there to expect them and they would be arriving. The trip on the Saint Lawrence River was a very wonderful trip an d we enjoyed it. Continuing, we came finally to Montreal, but the trip was very slow and instead of coming there in the afternoon as we had expected, we came there in the evening about nine o'clock. And there is a certain regulation that if a ship comes to port after nine o'clock, I don't know if this is in all co untries, but were there, if a ship comes after nine o'clock, then the passe ngers can either depart, go off or stay on the boat until the next morning. The others, most of the others had relatives waiting ther e, but we didn't know any one in Montreal and so we preferred to stay on the boat. Next morning, we got ready to disembar k and the man came again from the, from the JIAS, it's ca lled, the Jewish Immigrant Aid Society and he said to us he would take us and he would first bring us to a little hotel, not hotel, to a little restaurant for breakfast and then he would bring us straight to the train station and where we would leave by train to our destination. Our destination was Yorktown, Sask atchewan, that's where our cousin was living. However, it was a Friday morning and we wanted to st ay in Montreal if at a ll possible, at least over the Sabbath and we asked him, so he said no, that can't be done, because we have strict orders from the Canadian government, that all the refugees, greenhorns, they are called at that time, greenhorns, 24 I don't know from where the name greenhorn comes. Maybe green as the ____ is green. So what happened? So the greenhorns have first to be, have, cannot stay wher e they want to stay, they must go to their destination, because there's an affidavit that these people guaranteed that they would take care of them and the gove rnment will not take care of them, the Canadian government did not want to take care of them, they just wanted them out as much as possible, because Canada was not so friendly to the greenhorns, beca use I know about internment camp s in Canada, where people from England were sent to and stayed there for many years. Okay, so my father and we, and we children, all left and he brought us to a small restaurant an d we had breakfast there and then he brought us to the train station. Now the train in Canada at that time was a Canadian Pacific Train, railroad company I think it was and it was a small shack, I wouldn't call it mo re than a shack. It was a small shack and it was in June, on June 15 th and it was very ho t in Canada, we never had such heat before in Germany, was very hot and winter's very cold, summer's very hot. And we were sitting there and he, I don't know if he gave us a ticket, or some how we stayed there, it was about 10 o'clock in the morning. So we thought of how, what can we do in order to remain in Mo ntreal, so we remembered one thing, that we had written to relatives in Montreal, my father had a cousin from Ekatarinaslav(ph) in Russia, who was a tailor and who had moved to Montreal and we had written them, but the letter had come back to Germany, addr essee not found. So we said, maybe he's, he's still living there, my father said and he was sure that he was still living. Maybe we can find out, but how can we find out? So about 10:30 I think it was, there was a desk in the train station and two nuns came in, because Canada, Quebec is Catholic, yo u see and two nuns came in and they put on a light and the light said, traveler's aid. So my fath er said, \"Maybe these nuns can find out if this family's still living here.\" So he went over to the nuns, but the nuns di dn't speak English and we didn't speak French. So what language are you speaking in. So they knew Russian, my father 25 spoke Russian to them and he told th em that we think there is a family living here, if they knew that we would be here, they would certainly take us in and we wouldn't have to go to Yorktown(ph), Saskatchewan. So the nuns said, but what's thei r name? Said Kaplan. There are many Kaplans, come to find out, Caplan with a C, Kaplan with a K. What 's the first name? Burr(ph) Kaplan. What's his profession? He was a ta ilor. What's his mother's, his wi fe's name? Bebe(ph), I think. So they came and they took the telephone book I think, or address bo ok that they had at that time and they went through it and they called up all these people and they called up and people came to the the phone and they said, no, I' m not from Ekatarinaslav(ph), I'm not a tailor, etcetera, etcetera. So they called up 15, 16 people, then they called up someon e and there came a young boy at that time, of my age, from the phone and he said, I don't know, but I'll call my mother, so he called his mother, his mother says, \"Yes, my husband's name is Burr(ph), he's a tailor, he came from Ekatarinaslav(ph), what are you calling about?\" They said, \"There are some people who are claim you are relatives and they want to talk to you.\" Ok ay, so made my father talk to them and my father right away recognized him, he seen him, he, not he, his wife, they ha dn't seen each other for, at that time I mean, 15, 20 years and she said, \"What? You're here? I have a son who is a pharmacist, his name is Jackie, so I call him and have come right over and we take you in to our house.\" So we waited about 15 or 20 minutes and th en he came and he came and he took us all and we went to, we went to the Kaplan's and we stay ed there for a few days and in th e mean time we di d not go to, to Canada. But, what happ ened was this, in the mean time, about 11 o'cl ock, we had received a telegram, I don't know how it came to us, it came to the JIAS, probably, because the JIAS had sent them a telegram that your refuge e, your family is here and we are going to send them right on to you, so they had sent a telegram, Western Union, I still have the cert ificate and they said to them, \"Stay where you are, we cannot suppo rt you here because we had drou ghts for several years.\" They 26 were farmers and I was supposed to be a farmer and the young fellow at that time, who was about my age, I would be his farmer, you see and I never had seen the family , just recently, last year only, I met him. Now he is 72 years old. At that time he was 20. So what happened is, stay there. So he said to us, the man from the JIAS said to us, that doesn't matter because he promised to let you stay there and the Canadian government made us promise them that we will send them all back there, but this is ____ how we stay ed there, through Ameri ca, because the _____ out about it. I don't know what happened to the tickets , but we stayed there, so we stayed in Montreal. "

So we were living there for a few days and then they got us an apartment, not an apartment, a room, I think for 18 dollars a month, a month and it was a shaky room, but anyhow we were staying at and in the mean time, to get settled there, we needed a job and other things like this. My brother got a job right away. My brother got a job in a hardware store because and because he worked with toys and he invented certain toys at that time, you see. He got a job right away. My sister, was very hard for her to get a job, so sh e kept the house for us for the time being and my younger brother went to school there or something like this and my father, who was a bicycle mechanic couldn't find a job here and I couldn't find a job here, but, but somehow there was an employment agency, the Baron de Hirsch(ph) Institute in, in there and I got a job, we got a job the first time, I got a job to bring fl owers, like carrying flowers, brin g, like a messenger. Bring flowers 27 from here to here. Second time I got a job in a ki nd of a bicycle store to clean up the cellar, they had had a fire, but they had a fire after us too, so we had to leav e again, I don't know. How much did they pay, they paid one dollar a day, one Canadian dollar a day, that was a lot of money then. Then finally I got a job in a chicken factory, no t chicken factory, chicke n business and I didn't like the smell, didn't want to go there. Besides this, at that time, they wanted you to work every day and I didn't want to work on the Sh abbat, ____ want, couldn't get the job. Then I went again to, there was a Jewish newspaper in Montreal which was called The Eagle, the Atler(ph).

Saskatoon is in Saskatchewan. Very good paying job, 15 dollars a week. That was very much because what mo st people, 10 dollars a week was the average. So I went to, I said to them, \"Okay, what do I ha ve to do there?\" They said, \"You have to do this, and have to do that and you have to be a man of everything , you have to be their hausen(ph) cantor(ph), you have to read the Torah, you have to teach them, you have to do everything, for 15 dollars a week.\" I think I took it at that time, I said to them, \"I will, I will think it over\", but in fact I didn't want it.

His name was Fevel(ph) Pastillnik(ph) and Fevel(ph) Pastillnik(ph), he was already a little bit older, not too old he wasn't, only like 50, 60 years old. So he came over to us and he said to me, \"You went to Wurzburg, to the seminary, as a te acher, you see and you were in _____, go to the United States. That's the only, because in Cana da there isn't much Yiddishgad( ph),\" Jewishness, \"you go United States.\" And at that time, just at that time, they closed it. Up to that time students could come very easily to the United States, but it was closed in 1938 or 1939, that you needed more than just this, you needed a reason, other things. So, I didn't thi nk much of it and I said , \"What can you do?\" But one day he called us up, this Fevel(ph) and said, \"I saw in a Jewish paper, there was a Yiddish paper, written in Yiddish, it's for the Americana, the American and it said on the front page of this,\" unfortunately I don't have that paper any more, I had it for _____. \"On the fr ont page of this paper is a big picture of refugees, who came to Baltimo re and some of them ca me from Wurzburg\", from where I had studied, and he said he wants to show it to me and if I recognized any of them. I had no interest in that, but I said to myself, \"What can you lose? Go to him and look at it.\" So I went to him one day, it was in August, I think it was in August and, and he showed me the picture and I recognized a few people on these pictures, I recognized them. Besides this I read the article and it mentioned a certain Kalibar(ph), Rabbi Kalibar(ph), not that Kalibar(ph), related to them. And he said to me what I do is, what I should do is, I should write to this yeshiva(ph) near Israel ____ College in Baltimore, it's still existing. And I should tell them about this and see what's happening. So I wrote to them, it's in here, and I got an answer right away and the answer sa id, \"We will accept you. We will accept you. We will give you an affidavit and just co me in. Go to the Consul and have it verified.\" Now at th at time, to get permission to go from Canada to Britain ... 29"

Then it was independent of Britain, but at that ti me it was still dependent on Britain. So I said to the Consul, I told them my story and he was very receiving, accepting it and he said to me, \"But you don't ha ve a valid passport, number one, num ber two, it's not so easy for students to get to the United Stat es now, number two, you don't have citizenship at all, you are not even a Canadian domiciled person, because you lived here less than six months, because we came in June 15th and this was August. You lived here less than... and you only gained citizenship, domicile in Canada, after six mont hs, so you are not domiciled perso n, so I cannot let you go.\" I said, \"But I promise that I will come back, because my family is here.\" He said, \"Still.\" So he said, \"I will do something special,\" he said. \"I will call my consul togeth er and discuss it with them and then you come before this consul and they can make a decision.\" So he made a, he called his people together, I don't know who was his high officials and I talked to them about the story and they said to me, finally and they, and they sent me out and then they called me back and said, \"We made a decision, we made a decision that we will let you go, as a student, until February, because you're, that means 60 days before your passport expires. Your passport ex pires in April 21st, we will let you go until February 21st, under the condition that when you come to Montreal, when you come to 30 Baltimore, you will have your passport extended by the Germans.\" I said okay. So I made the arrangements, and so I had the permission here now to go to Canada, to go to Baltimore, however, how will I get there? So I went again to the JIAS and I had no money and the JIAS gave me 30 dollars, I think. That was the amount of the trip. I went with Greyhound bus from Montreal to Baltimore."

I, all ri ght, when we came to the border, to the American bor der, they examined all my luggage and I had Tosefa Torah, which I spoke to you before, with me. They didn't know what it was, but I explained it to them. So we came then, to New York, first we come from, we stopped in New York and we stopped in New York in the middle of the night, 11 , 12 o'clock at night. And my fa ther had told me that he had a friend in New York, Eiseman(ph), whom he had onc e saved in Germany, he was in the prison and he had given him an affidavit and he was able to leave Germany and he went to the United States already, in the 20's . And he had sent us an affidavit at that time, we could have gone to United States in the 20's, but my mother didn't want to go beca use she had all the relatives in Germany. So we missed up on that opportunity. But when I came to New York, I said, \"I'm going to call up this person.\" I didn't know very mu ch about New York, we, we, at the Madison Square Garden, I think, we, there was a Greyhound station. So I called him up in the middle of the night, of course, I didn't know very much. So then I said I have to wait until the morning. Then in the morning I called up again, six or seven o'clock now and at that time th ey didn't, not everyone had a telephone, there was 32 probably one telephone for the w hole apartment house and people had to be called and come down to that place. It's a lit tle bit of history. So I call them and I sai d, \"Is there a Mr. Eiseman(ph) living in this building?\" and the woman said, \"Yes, yes ther e are, I'll call him, I' ll call him.\" And he came down to the phone and he heard me and when he heard me, he said, \"W here are you? You are going to stay here for a fe w days, I want you to stay here for a few days'\" and he will come and see me. \"So where do you li ve?\" This Mr. Eiseman(ph) lived in Brooklyn and I was in Manhattan and I didn't know the distances here, I thought maybe in half an hour he can come over, he said, \"No, it takes me at least two and a half hours.\" Long dist ances. And it was 1939, they had the World's Fair in New York at that time, I don' t know if you remember. So he said and he wants to show me the World's Fair. So I waite d there in the Greyhound station and finally he came over, his wife was home, I think and his daughter, they came and they came and they picked me up at 10 o'clock or so and we went to a kosher restaurant there and then he took me to the ____ and I stayed with him maybe at least overnight, one night, I don't rememb er any more how long a nd then next morning, I continued to Baltimore."

            "question": "In an Orthodox congregation?",
            "answer": "Yeah, different congreg ations in New York, but they were mu ch later. Because I stayed in Baltimore from 1939 to 1945 and in 1944, I was ordained as a rabbi and I learned there many years, with many other people and during the war, I can tell you, during the war, even in the United States, I was considered an alien, what do they call it? Enemy alien and I had to get permission to go from Baltimore to New York, each time, from the Attorney General, it wa s a woman, I went to her many times, put a stamp in the passpor t or so, something like this, ga ve me a special card. When I traveled from Baltimore to Yonkers, near New York, I also needed sp ecial permission. And I needed every year, an extension of my passport. So no w that comes to this point. All right, they had told me in Montreal, when you come there, ge t your passport extended, yeah? I go, I'm there. So I said to myself, wh o can extend it, it was made out by the German government, go to the German consulate. At that time, 1939, yeah, Cana da entered the war, I left, I left Canada on the fifth or sixth of September, Canada entered the wa r at, on the seventh of September, September, day after. So I came there, the Ge rman consulate, at that time, Am erica was not at war yet, so the Germans still had the consulate here. But I had no money to go there b ecause it was 15 cents 40 already at that time, a bu s in Washington, Baltimore . In New York was five cents a subway. So I got the money, I went to the consul and I said to myself, \"I have to be very careful when I go to these people.\" So I went up ther e. So they, so it was lunchtime. I didn't know that they have lunchtime in America and that there is such long lunchtime and they go out and no one is there. But there was someone there, so I said to him I wanted my passport extended if they can extend it. They said, \"Yes, leave the passport with us.\" I said to my self, \"No, I don't leave anything here.\" I take it with me and said, \"I come back another time.\" I never came back. I went to the Canadian consul, because I came from Canada and I said to him, \"I cannot get th is passport extended, but I only have permission here until February 21st, so if he cannot get perm ission for me, ex tension of the passport.\" So he said to me, you see, and this is interesting that he made a mistake and that saved me. He said to me, about, he did not ask me about domicile, he just said I came from Canada and he gave me permission to stay until June. Did he give me pe rmission? Then I had no more permission and he said he cannot give me permis sion any more because I wa sn't in Canada and he has no longer authority to do this. So I go to Wa shington and I told them, \"I came here on this passport that cannot be extended and I'm studying, I came here as a student and I cannot return to Canada because I didn't gain domic ile and I cannot return to Germany because they are at war\" and if I can stay here longer. So he gave me, Washington gave me permission for one more year and they waived my passport requirements and every year, only every ye ar I had to write to them for another year extension and that I did until the end of the war. And then at the end of the war, I made a, during the war I made a request to become a citizen. It was 1943, but I couldn't become a citizen at that time because it was the height of the war, Stalingrad. He said, \"Did you do anything for the war effort?\" So what could I do, I wasn't in the army, but I bought war bo nds, but that wasn't enough, so they said, \"No, you cannot become a citi zen now, but after six mo nths, you can reapply.\" 41 So I reapplied again after six mont hs and the situation got better, th en I got the FBI to help me and finally, in 1945, I got what's calle d first papers. At that time th ere were first papers and second papers, now you can right away become a citizen. Anyhow I had to wait five years in between and then in 1951, I became a citizen. When I became a citiz en, I changed my name. Why did I change my name? First of all, my wife didn't lik e this name, in the meantime I got married, 1948, so."

The middle is Wein and I don't like one name, one syllable names, so make it Weiner, so they make my name Weiner. It's in my naturalization papers. During the war, I tried to do many things.

I wa s working also with the Agoutis(ph) Historic movement there and I, groups of childr en and to others and I send children to camps in summer and so forth, I did this all there and I instituted someth ing in Baltimore, three things I instituted there because I thou ght, it is in the American heir that they are a little bit, so big, at least it was at that time, to be a little bit more distant. So I wanted the people in the Yeshiva to be a little bit 42 closer, so I arranged something, they had only a lo an fund, so I said, \"The re are some people who cannot pay back a loan, we make it the charity fund and give out forthwith, money.\" Number two, I made arrangements with the doctors who would gi ve free service to the Yeshiva boys.

And then, afterwards, I mean the McCarthy hearings and so forth, the un-Ame rican committee, see that it's not American again, not too much American. I mean that was a, a leftover, I would say, from what the thinking was here in the beginning of the 40's. Is means that they very much believed in, in pure American and anything which came from outside of America, like Ru ssia, and the Communists and so forth, was considered, you cannot live with it and you have to fight it.

I don't know if this is the right answer, there is no right answer to it."

At one point, at one point I could have gotten a job, I was even offered a job already, in Portland Oregon, I was offered a job, in 19, 1956 and I got the contract in and everything like this and I thought everyt hing would be okay and I would be able to do this, to go there, to start a school and certain other things and I discussed it wi th some of the friends he re and some intelligent 50 people, if this is country that's reliable, if I can believe it and they said, \"Yes.\" But what happened is, I made already arrangements for the plane to go there and the condition was, my condition, that I would go there for three m onths on trial and if I like it, I stay, if I don't, and fulfill the complete contract, if not I would come back. But just th e day before I was leaving, I was told that they changed their mind there and they don't want to make a school there, they want to make some kind of a social program or who knows what there and I had already given up my job, which I had here. I had two jobs, I had the job in the Hebrew school and I had the job in the burlap factory. And fortunately, the burlap factory, they took me back right away, even though I had canceled with them, the Jewish school did not take me back, but I di dn't mind and the Por tland, the one who had signed the contract gave me 50 dollars, which was not very much for the w hole contract, which they signed, so then I decide d, I'm not going into this field any more, because you cannot believe them and I wanted to go on something which was safer. Then I found out about the city of New York and I went into the Social Work Sy stem with the city of New York."

Some input, not just just on the receiving end. This is unfortunate ly, naturally, people like to be se rved, but that's not how we can build up something. So that's just the kind of input, and when I came here, for instance, that 51 synagogue, they didn't have a certain class, so I instituted a class there. When I came here, they didn't have a certain kind of information sheet, so I instituted an information sheet. When I came to Wurzburg, they did not have a news letter all the time, so we instituted a newsletter and ____ to the _____ and we told them some stor ies about, I would like some input.

You can say, I have done what I do, what I've wa nted to do and I have done this and that's how it will go, it will be, it will be. Things may change, things change all the time. The only constant in this world is change. So it will constantly change and I don't think that anti-Semitism will ever stop. Because I see it, whether it's in Israel, whether it's all over, you see, there are always people who are ve ry self-centered and they want ju st what they want and they do whatever is necessary in order to get what they want without thinking about other people, hurting other people or harming or killing other people. So therefore, I can only feel safe in the way, what I'm doing. If you believe in a certain thing, you believe in this and then you feel safe."

You can only be, be vigilant in your own approach and what you are doing yourself, not vigilant in respect to, in regard to other pe ople, that will not help very much. Because one war brings upon another war ____, like it wa s in, in Germany. First the war of 1870 brought about the war of 1914, 52 brought about the war 1939 and so forth.

If someone has a belief, then he knows something, then he, then he, then he feels safe.

The Germans were always loyal to their leader, not only were they loyal to their leader, also they wanted to be on top of everybody. And they believed in the Darwin theory, the survival of the fittest, we have to be the fittest, the Germans said. Now if ever yone thinks I'm the fittest and he will always subdue other ones and have weaker ones whom he destroys and that's what I want to end with. Th e teacher once, once asked me, he brought it out in a class an d he said, \"The Germans are supe rior and all the other races are inferior, because we are the strongest, we are the tallest, we are the blondest, we have the bluest eyes,\" and so forth. A nd, and he said to me, this was a Nazi teacher, \"What do you think about it?\" I said to him, \"There is nothing in this world superi or or inferior, everyone can rise to a high level, everyone can go low. But there is one thing in this world which the Nazis don't recognize and that's that every person's different and you don't real ize the difference between one person, everyone contributes something you see and you cannot pu t him down because he's different and him down because he's different in this way and he's diff erent in that way.\" Same thing like happens in America now. Everyone's different, they can all contribute and as lo ng as they contrib, as long as someone thinks I am superior and you are inferior, I am a majority and you are a mi nority. Once a person in my office told me, \"The Jews are not a minority,\" he said to me. \"Not in New York, \" I said, but maybe another thing. So I asked him, \"When does a minor ity stop to be a minority? I 61 asked him. He couldn't answer that. But some one's, if someone works under the logical thinking that he's a minority, then he will always strive to be a majority, we always strive to majority and there will always be a fight going on, but the only time someone thinks I'm different , I have certain things which you don't have and you have certain things which I don't have, then they will live together in peace."

            "answer": "I think I made a mistake, it should not be calle d Nazi school, but German school. Because when Hitler came to power, all the previous directors and teachers were either asked to become members of the Nazi party, or leave the school. So the di rector in my school, wher e I went, the _______, had been with the Social Democrat party and he was dismissed. An d from then on, there were two kinds of teachers, the teachers who were members of the party from long time ago, the early numbers, all the early numbers had priority or a later number. But they came all in with the Nazi emblem, which was like a lifesaver and there was written NASDP , National Socialist Democratic Workers Party, that's how they called themselves, with a swastika in the middle and one teacher came in with a Nazi uniform and whenever a teacher came in, the students get up and says Heil Hitler, when the teacher leaves the classroom, Heil Hitler, they all stand up. But that was, that was already before that they would st and up, but that was respect for th e teacher, because you were, you were supposed to have respect for the teacher, the teacher wa s a high official in Germany."

I didn't have to lift my hand, but then on the other hand, some people who didn't know it, would beat you up if you didn't do it."

But I tell you, I saw a boy on a bicycle, he met a Nazi and he lifted his hand and he fell from his bike, so they said on the bike, you don't have to lift your hand, just make, sit up straight. But this teacher came in and one of these teachers who was from Strasbourg, AlsaceLorraine, which was French and German again, he called me over, his son wa s in my own, in my class, in my class, same class as I am. He said to me privately, \"You know, I am not actually anti-Semitic,\" he said, \"but in order to keep my job, I have to put this life saver on,\" he said to me. And, and this other teacher I told you about, he gave a course in Assencunder(p h), it means knowledge of the races."

            "answer": "I had to take it. The only thing is, afterwards they changed, that I didn 't go on Shabbat any more to school, so this teacher was an older teacher, he was 65 at that time, he called me over and he said to me, \"If you don't come to school on Saturday, I'm going to teach Hitler's Kampf, Mein Kampf, the book on Saturday, so you do, are not there. And if y ou miss anything, I will gi ve you the, I will tell some student to give you the homework,\" see there, but still, some teachers of, from the older class, you see. But they had to be members, you see and if yo u had and if not, they could be dismissed. Now him they probably left, he was going anyhow, retir ement age 65 there, he left. That's okay, but, but I help as a te acher, you see, when he gave this kind, so I asked a question, what makes it _____. Why does he know everything? So they taught th at he has intuition that comes 63 from himself Hitler does not believe in manifest ation from above, becaus e there's no one above him. No God, no nothing, he didn't believe in God, even thou gh he was Catholic. So there's no manifestation from above, everything comes from the blood and soil and it goes up to him and he knows it by intuition. What they ca ll a, I forget already the word in German, but it's something like a combination of blood and soil."

            "answer": "They taught me similar things and they also taught me that the German race is superior. Why? Because when God created the world in he interprets the bible, but not the correct way of course, he created man and then they believe in Darwin's theory, that the fittest survive, only the survival of the fittest, so that mean s the fittest survive and we ar e the fittest. The Jews ar e not fit, that's why they have to be eradicated. And about this, what I me ntioned before about inferiority and superiority and which I don't believe in, I believe in the same thing, you see, but di fference, differency, differentiation, but I don't believe in superior and th is other thing. And fina lly, oh, not about that. I was the only student of 700 in that school, that was a big school."
