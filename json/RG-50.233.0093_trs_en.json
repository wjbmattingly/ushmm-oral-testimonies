There is three girls from my hometown and then there\u2019s me. Because I was sixteen. So you had to be a certain age and a certain weight and a certain shape -- too fat and they wouldn\u2019t -- you went right away if you were too fat. And then finally when you made it and after six months in Auschwitz you had to be -- you couldn\u2019t be too skinny, you couldn\u2019t have any pimples on you -- you know? It\u2019s unbelievable."

As I told you a while ago -- I made up my mind, I am not going to run to and I am not going to run away. Where God will put me, that is where I am going to go. And that is what I did. I didn\u2019t run to and I didn\u2019t run from. Like they used to say, they\u2019re picking from this block or that block and they ran to that block to be picked or ran away from our block so that they shouldn\u2019t be picked. I let God\u2019s hands and then I never believed ... Oh -- this you must hear too. In the labor camp, I have -- I happened to have a mechanical mind. So they put me to work -- to do a man\u2019s machine -- work a man\u2019s machine. So because I understand machinery."

            "answer": "Right, yes. So, some of the girls -- now here, I worked between all the men -- and some of the girls used to flirt with the men --they used to meet them in the hallway and flirt with them and I wouldn\u2019t. I said like this -- if I\u2019m going to burn- there will be less of me to burn. If they give you a slice of bread, an apple -- I don\u2019t need that. If I\u2019m going to burn, there will be less of me to burn. If I am going to survive then I have a conscience I want to live with my conscience -- that is not to sell my soul for a piece of bread or for a piece of apple. And I didn\u2019t get anything from them, but I did the delivery -- the food, the mail back and forth. That is another thing -- I am very proud of myself that I was young and yet I had my principles."

Would you believe they\u2019re going to let you survive and tell the world what happened? I never believed. The only thing I hoped was for the bombs to come. So then I said, if they put me in the crematorium, I will burn quicker if there is less fat on me. So that is my morals."
