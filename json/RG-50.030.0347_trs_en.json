However, Poland went through a cataclysm, they always got the wars because they was in the middle between Russia and Germany and Austria, all the borders.

My father give away a lot of charity to Jewish organizations and Gentile organizations, alike. And about myself, I went to Yeshiva. This means Orthodox school. Later when I got older, I went to a Gentile school. I graduate from high school. After I graduate, my parents and myself, they try to send me to law school which I attended two years. After school, I was sitting in courthouse, and listen cases. I could not accomplish my mission because the Germans, they came and they destroy our life, our country, our families. For a while, I saved my parents, my brothers and sisters, before the war they left to France. And I was myself home, try to work older brother, with two older brothers, with Gustav and Baruch. Later the Nazis came, they occupied, because Szczecin was a strategic point close to the borders, the German borders. From us to Germany could be 15 minutes. Some areas was written, signs in stores was written in two languages: Polish and German. So tight we was close to the German borders. On September 8, I was in a spot they called this Chachiramia (ph). This was a street by the name like Beverly Hills, and all of a sudden -- I walk with a Gentile person, with our neighbor's son, and all of a sudden, came about approximately in my estimation is about 2 or 4,000 airplanes in the air. Very low and below was maybe 10,000 motorcycles on the bottom. And the airplanes, they tried to protect those motorcycles if maybe the opponents, they will fight back immediately. Nothing happened. They went through. In three days or four days, they occupied all Poland. Later they -- Poland was divided. The Germans, they divided Poland in ghettos, in camps, and they make Lodz was the biggest ghetto in the United States. Excuse me, in Poland. Pardon me, in Poland. Later they open up ghettos in every city, approximately in every city. A ghetto, to inform you better, is like this: They select six, seven streets, big streets, and they close up on both sides. And they concentrate all those people in this particular street, in those streets. And they have to live inside, sleep, and do work, undernourished. The minimum, very minimum amount food. And everything under terror. Mostly they got bottles would send and water. Bottles, regular bottles. If he don't like you face or he don't like you, he just bend you in half with a bottle of water or they send. You be dead on the spot. Maybe they take you out and they throw you away, we don't know where they put those people. This was the most barbarian time in 3,000 years. Never was something, what I saw for my own eyes."

So they put in a Star of David, a yellow Star of David, and this was the recognition, this you a Jew. Because I was a different Jew myself. A different Jew means some Jewish people, they gave up.

The next will be France.\" In his speech, this phrase. And I was standing arm and shoulder and shoulder in the middle. Nobody. As a matter of fact, some Germans, they just mumbling against those speeches. Those speech, what he was holding. They cannot talk. If he talk right away, he be in jail for 15 years or they shoot him on the spot, whatever it is. Or this is a Gentle, or Jew, whatever it is. This was their policy, nobody can be against me or against our system or against our program."

            "num": 14,
            "question": "What did it feel like being in this crowd?",
            "answer": "The feeling is just like they take somebody to the electric chair in a civilized country, and ten minutes before he get electrocuted they ask him, \"What is your wish?\" One guy said, \"I'd like to hear a symphony.\" Another guy, he said, \"I'd like to have a better meal,\" or whatever it is. What his desire is. My desire is to see how the Germans get back what they deserve, what they did to that civilized people all over the world. Anyhow, I tried to protect my one brother and his family. I lost everybody, they went to France and later I got no contact with them. I tried to help out because my brother, he was six feet and two inches tall, and he got four kids. And included my parents, my father and my mother, try put them in a separate spot. And I tried to hidden them maybe for nine months after I put them in a spot, in a room, of course. And I paid a Gentile money not to, you know. And I brought them food and whatever they need the most. And after this I got no choice no more. So I did before I lost them, there was big house, a big home with a big yard you could take in about 2,000 people. So they put in 2,000 Jewish families, singles, whatever it is, Jewish people, included my father. Got caught and they got them inside. My brother got inside. So I went -- let's see, this 1s the area over here where they concentrated 2,000. And the neighbor wall, so I work about night time between one and three o'clock in the morning, nobody knows. And I took out bricks -- you know, Europe houses, they build from bricks. So I took out the bricks, brick by brick, until I make a big hole. And I went inside and I put on Yuder, the Star of David. Because without a star, I could not go in. Not in, because not through the front doorwell, everybody can go in and out. So I make a hole, and I was inside. And you can imagine for your own eyes what's going on inside with those people. People automatically lost their mind. They lost their faith in life. They got nothing for one minute in mind, they will survive or they can live, or they let them live. So I took my father because every dead person who dies inside, they took them out in like a pushcart. So I took my father and make believe he's dead on the pushcart, and I got him out from the house. And I locate him in a spot; later I came to my brother, and I tried to get him out. And my brother, he was a very strong person. And I said, \"Come on, I take you out. I got a spot, I take you out.\" He said, \"I gave up. I gave up.\" And there was not too much time to convince him, \"What are you doing?\" And I got my father out, and him, he don't want to go out. And he was a big smoker, smoking. He said, \"The only thing what you can do for me, bring me a cigarette. Bring me a cigarette, please. You save my life, bring me a cigarette.\" I said, \"Come on out. I give you ten packages cigarette. Come on out.\" I try again and again and again. I could not convince him. And I got out my father, and I got out his wife with the kids. And he, no way; I could not convince him. And people so when I took out all those, my father and my sister-in-law with the kids, so they tried to do the same thing to get out from this. After this happened, I run away. Of course, let them do. The first three, four people I helped them out, to get out. Later I don't want to risk my head, and I went and I brought food for my sister-in-law with the kids and for my father with my mother. My mother start tobe... [Interview stops here] End of Tape 1.

From Funfteichen, I tried to escape, and one time I run away from the camp was between according to imagination was approximately 6 o'clock European time. And I walk, I never got shave. I look, you know, like a rabbi, and I wear stripes. This was -- I forgot. I give you a correction. Between a camp, Funfteichen -- between Funfteichen, grows rows and things like this. In Funfteichen, 1n Marx-Stadt, you wear clothing, plain clothing -- any clothing. When you went to concentration camp to Funfteichen, you went a uniform. They give you a uniform to recognize you, you a prisoner. You understand? Because we was builders, and over here in concentration already. This was the difference, the uniform, stripes. They called this a possack (ph), stripes blue and white, whatever it is. Now, where Iam now? About run away. I run away 6 o'clock in the evening, and I came to a spot by myself. I came to a spot north, south, east, west, and I'm in the middle. And I said to myself, \"What the hell should I do with myself? Where should I go?\" Go this way, maybe I get caught over here. Maybe go south, they catch me over here. Till I see a little light, like from the mountains. You see a little light like a candle, candlelight. And I said to myself, \"I take a chance. I go where the light is.\". When I came to the light, close to the light, so I knocked the door where the light is. Was an old lady, and she was knitting a sweater or whatever it is, and I ask her in this part they speak German. And I speak German, so I ask her, \"Can you tell me where the police is over here?\" When I asked her police, so she know I am not a criminal. Do you understand what I am talking to you? I ask her where are the police is over here, and they told me the police, you have to go over here two miles is the police, or three miles. I don't remember exactly. She give me direction how to go. Wherever she go, I went the opposite. That road to the police, to get caught. When I went when she opened the door for me and she gave me the direction, so I asked her, \"Maybe you have something to eat.\" She said, \"I have no bread.\" I asked her for bread, and she said, \"I have cake.\" Mostly, in Europe they bake, you know, cake. They call this in Czechish, the call this moksha (ph). In this area, they speak German and Czech, Slovakish. She said, \" \" \"T have cake.\" I said, \"Okay.\" I never saw cake for five years. And she give me the cake. When she give me the cake, I said, \"Can I have some water?\" Everybody give you water. And I got water and cake. Later I start to be too fresh and I ask if she can give me a razor blade to just cut it up, the whole thing, and to run away further. She give me a razor blade, she was by herself. Later she got -- she was so nice to me. God should remember this woman. Later she said to me a story what happened with her. Her daughter's husband, he was an SS man, and he went to the army. All the families, they're for four years, five years in the army, and she hated Germans. You never believe it, they called this -- we was originally I was Sudeten-Deutschland. This is between Czechs and Germany. And they speak, you know, both languages. I spoke with her, and she was very nice. She give me a razor blades and everything. Later I said to myself, \"I got a piece cake, and I got water, and I got a razor blade. The only solution to the problem, you better go back to the camp, because I get killed, I know.\" So I want you to listen with both ears this situation. All of a sudden, two more boys, they are run away from the camp, and I met those two guys. Till there was three; three is no good. Too many is no good. There was three. And all of a sudden, we came close, came a -- they called this an SI -- they got SS, they got the black over here, the storm troopers. And the other one was SA, was the yellow uniforms, a different uniform. And the guy came was just in yellow, a local guy. He came, \"What the hell you guys doing over here? Where do you come from?\" Told him we get out, we bandits. They got all -- I got shaved; they don't.

When he came to me, I said, \"I am a Jew.\" You have to excuse me, the guy who said Lithuanian, he said, \"Put on the pants. Open the pants, put it on. I want to see are you circumcised.\" He wants to see, he knows they are Jewish people, they circumcised. When he did this, he saw the guys, they was circumcised. So they both, they told him a lie. He said he's a Ukrainian, or whatever it 1s, and I said I'm a Jew. So he said to the guys, \"Open your mouth.\" He killed them on the spot, both. Both they got killed. After the liberation, I went to looking for. Are they still, or they put him away? And because I told the truth, I am a Jew, I survived. They let me live because I don't lie to them."

            "answer": "You know, this is a very long story to tell you how instinct. When you came to a situation, every creature, every human being, everything what is life, take a look at the guy got shot down with the airplane. The guy, for five days, he ate worms. Did you hear what the guy said on television? He ate worms, he got no food. He survived. Later they pick him up and they found him, and they brought him back. When you came to a situation like this, is no diplomacy. Is no knowledge, is no study. You could be educated, you could be the biggest idiot in -- the instinct for yourself dictate you what you should do. And this is life, nothing else. Not because I was smart or smarter than those two guys. I told him I am a Jew, I am not ashamed I am a Jew. In Marx-Stadt, I go back to Marx-Stadt, to my boss where I went to work, Dr. Visner. Till we got one foreman, a German, from the company, from Dr. Visner's company. He got a two-by-four stick, two-by-four, he could grab it, you know, and this. And one time he came to me. He said, \"You was talking politic,\" to me. He slapped me in the face, and he report me and hit me in the head over here. You see over here? Can you see where he hit me? It was bloody, blood and everything, okay. Try to why he hit me, and I figured out forget it. Those work this way. In Marx-Stadt when you was -- our group was about, let's see, what we were productive is we make those cinder blocks. So was maybe eight or ten, a small group. In the morning when we left the gate, the guy put on number 1180. Numbers, you are number, not a name. Just a number. They put on the numbers. When you come back, you get the numbers back. And he registered, he see all the registered the same amount people, they don't run away or whatever it is. So the same guy who hit me with the two-by-fours, he report to the Ustachi (ph). Ustachi means the leader from the camp in Marx-Stadt."

But this guy came, so this guy who hit me with the two-by-four, he report to the Ustachi. All the complaints go to the Ustachi, to this guy. So he got guys, kapos, whatever they receive complaints, they take them in and they put them on a bench. When I came in and the Ustachi, this guy, the first thing. Guilty or not guilty? No way, you are not going. First he slapped me in the face. I fall on the floor. The guy was a husky, strong guy. When I fell on the floor, he said -- I don't to mention the language what he said translate into English, because I will be embarrassed for a lady to say what he said. Something extraordinary language. So he said to those kapos, he said, \"Pull down the pants. Open the pants. Pull down the pants. Lay down on the bench.\" They got a bench like this. And they gave me 50, how should I say it? I lost my language, my vocabulary. Fifty punches on my hinter. For your information, on the end I could not stand up. So he throw me down on the floor, lie down like a dog. They will not do this to a dog. And later he said, \"Stand up, you bitch,\" you know. He said, \"Stand up. Stand up. Stand up.\" And I can stand up and I stand up. My hinter, you have to excuse me, was -- how should I give you a description how it was? Ink, red ink, the whole thing. He said, you know, \"Come tomorrow to work. You go on the company \"This means on the phylactery, you know, they got a room. Lay down in the bed, and from this bed people who don't go to work, they send to Auschwitz, for your information. Because they need over here people to go to work, because this is a working camp, not a concentration camp. A working camp. So I was two days -- a miracle was they don't send me to Auschwitz, and I went to work the third day. I was praying to God to go to work. When I came to work and the same guy who hit me with the two-by- four, he said, \"You know what you did? You was listen illegal radio, news about the Germans, that they lost the war.\" I said, \"I never -- how you got that idea? You could not even explain? You can't even talk?\" He said he had to listen, nothing else. So this was the two experiences the direction run away and got killed two guys, and I survived. The guy, he came, he said I was listening to illegal radio about the war."

The Russian, Americans, they don't let them breathe; 24 hours a day, every day 2 o'clock in the morning, you can see for yourself the lights. Because we was in shelters, but they bombard.

And everybody dance in the street, because Theresienstadt, they planning to make -- the Germans was planning to make oven like in Auschwitz, but they don't got the time to build this. They stop with soldiers. So after liberation on every corner like in the depression year, do you remember the American war was, in 1929 in the depression? On every corner they stand -- they give away soup with the bread, you know, to the people. They got no jobs and everything. This remind me of this. On every corner they're putting soup and bread and food after liberation. And a little boy, I saw from 12 years, he got a group maybe 800 Germans, they got caught. And he said to me -- command, a boy with a stick like a baseball bat and he said to them, \"Open your shoes. One shoe wear and one shoe barefoot.\" So they went with one shoe, and he given the command and every guy who said one word, right away he hit him so badly this little guy, little boy. And I said, \"Isn't this not a miracle?\" Is a miracle how six days I was looking how they march, and all of a sudden, they dead forever. Later we came, the Americans came this way on ships. The Russians came this way. They kiss each other, embrace each other. And they brothers and sisters, and everybody dance in the streets and everything. Because Theresienstadt was a group mostly German Jews, primarily. They concentrate because they speak Germany, and the most intellectuals from all over the world, they sent like from Buchenwald and to Theresienstadt.

We were with a group, and the group was -- this group was half Jews and half Gentiles. Mixed marriages. She was Jewish, he was a Gentile. She was a Gentile, he was Jewish. Groups like this. Maybe five couples. The one lady who the Nazis beat them up and kill them, and she and her mother and a son, they live in Theresienstadt. Not in the camp. I was at the camp. I considered I met this woman, and she got really a crush on me. She liked to marry me. I -- you know, those days is my mind was all mine, to see my brothers and sisters and maybe some from the family. And who got in health is something in my mind. But she was an extraordinary, cultured person. Very educated. She was playing the piano and I played the piano. So we was playing the piano together, she invite me to her mother -- to her mother's house in Theresienstadt. And her mother, she just speak Czechoslovak. In Czech, I am good, I am not so good, but I understand every conversation I could have with her mother. And her mother, she was to me like a mother, honest, the old lady. I am talking about Lena. Anyhow, my friend, he said he was crazy about her. And she was a person to be really crazy, believe me, she was a very nice person. And she told me the story about what happened with her husband, Jewish husband. The Nazis came and they know he is Jewish, and they start up with him and they kill him. They take him away, and they got a son, Peter, and Peter camel she came with her son. So I said to her, \"You know, Lena,\" her name was Lena. So I said to Lena, \"If I go to the United States, you go with me. You cannot go without us.\" And they came to the United States. She came to the United States and her son. Her son went into the Air Force, he was in the Air Force. And she was -- she did fashion design, very creative person. And my friend, he die for her, and he married her. When he marry her, the mother, she was in Czechoslovakia. She left her mother. Later she promised by any situation, maybe we take the mother over here to the United States. She was in, let's see, about in the '70s. Maybe a little better. And Lena, she visited her mother twice, and came back to the United States. And her mother, she said she will stay in Czechoslovakia, in Theresienstadt. Peter, her son, we was ready to adopt him. He was so nice, as my son. Honest, what a kid that he was. It was unbelievable. But when I was in Theresienstadt and she told me what the Nazis did to him. So I said, Give me the names. I get even with those guys who did to your husband.\" She said, \"They got arrested before.\" Some neighbors, Gentile neighbors, they pointed out this guy, he was another Hitler, a guy, type like this. And I don't know what, they took him away and I went, \"Okay.\" Later this was Lena, this story. Later I went to the kazzam, it was a Hungarian kazzam. Hungarians, they have a language like Gypsies. Very yak, yak, yak, yak -- is very, very tough language. I walk in and they told me. I said, \"What kind of language you speak over here?\" They said, \" \"I said, \"They got to be Hungarian.\" Nobody else. I asked and they told me they're Hungarian. They all almost naked after liberation."

And like , without her, I met few women and ask, \"Do you have son at Polish lady by your name, Esther?\" She said -- one woman said, \"I met a Polish woman over here.\" \"Can you bring the woman over here?\" She said, \"Yes.\" Because I could not even go in. My heart was broken how those people after liberation. Few days, few days she brought and this was my godmother. I almost got a heart attack. In those days, they didn't even know what a heart attack means. Today I can assure you, I got a heart attack when this happen. And I see my mother, how she look. I said, \"What a fighter. You sit over here. I will be back in an hour. I bring you clothing, dresses and everything.\" So asked Lena in Czechoslovakian, in Theresienstadt in the city who was in the haberdasher stores, who was in the clothing. Who was this, who was this? And she told me this woman, they was in the clothing business. They have dresses, ladies' dresses. Everything 1s hidden. Everything, you know, after the war, they put us in cellars, in the walls of the building, whatever it is. So I go in, I said, \"Lady, I would like to have two, four dresses.\" She said, \"God forbid. My God, . We have nothing. We lost everything. We poor people. We got nothing.\" And she said, \" \"She's a 10 percent Jewish, she told me. Everybody after the war, they start to be Jewish. Everybody was. I said, \"Look, I am talking to you nice. You got hidden the dresses. If you don't give me four or five dresses, I can assure you'll be dead over here in 10 minutes from now. Right now, I want the dresses.\" She listened -- dead. She said, \"Maybe I look, maybe I can find it. Maybe I can look.\" She goes downstairs in the cellar. Loaded with clothing, boxes with this hidden in this here. She give me five dresses. Then I want underwear. She brought me everything what a woman need. Panties and these, whatever it is. And I brought it to my mother, and I said, \"Go at.\" Later I talk with here. \"How do you survive? In this age, how you survive?\" And she told me, \"You know, Dave, what I did? I tell how I survive? I took a brick, brick from the house. And take two bricks and make powder and put in a rouge on my face to look 20 years younger. And I make this and I make this.\" And she explained to me. I said, \"Look, I don't you be over here, not even one minute. You go with me right now.\" I took her out, and she rest a week. Later she went to the kitchen to work in the kitchen as a manager. She worked as a supervisor/manager, they don't know manager. Supervise in the kitchen. So she work for a while until we got established, because Lena, the lady, she was a local person. And she knows very well, later they establish rules and regulations, you could not say you kill if you don't give me this. This was in the beginning. Later I expect my brother. My brother, my older brother, he got life. After the liberation, I went to friends, and they told me is living, he is in Morocco. When he came back and I left him, a sign, your brother we never knew each other almost. I was a little kid, and he was the older brother. So he say he came to me. Later we went to Landsberg am Lech, we all the group let them go to hell. We will stay over here. The whole thing is with blood, with tears, whatever they -- so we went to Landsberg am Lech where Hitler wrote his Mein Kampf, the book. Are you familiar with this? You know what I'm talking? He wrote Mein Kampf, the book, Hitler. In Landsberg am Lech, I went to the chaplain in Germany, and I said, \"Chaplain, I would like to have a place to live. I got my mother over here. I got my mother's daughter, my godmother's daughter with me. I got Lena, I got a bunch, a group with names and everything.\" So he give me two bedrooms and a kitchen and a house and maybe 25 feet -- maybe 50 feet where they put old Goering, Goebbels, all those to death. They got shot in Landsberg am Lech. Where they took the group and they kill them, and we was almost see how they did to them."

Everybody who go in in Abraham's house, he got a meal and clothing and dress and everything. Our house was Abraham's house. Everybody came, we feed them, we dress them. We do everything what we can do. This was in Landsberg am Lech. Landsberg am Lech, I'll give you the translation. Landsberg is the city, the name. Landsberg. On the Elbe, on the lake. So when I was after the liberation, I just butt in right now into something else. After liberation I was looking for my family in Germany. In Germany I could not find them, nobody. So I went to France, because I knew my family live in France. So my brother was in a camp -- my two brothers were in camp. My sister was in camp, the younger sister. And after the liberation, she died, and those two brothers, they survived. My brother, the older brother, he was a doctor. And the other brother, he was in the financing business as far as I remember in mind what is. So I left a note with a guy, so I came to France in the name Metz, M-e-t-z in Ludwigshafen. This is between the German border and the French borders. I came, I took a trip, was a long trip. Maybe 24 hours, and I go in and was a guy, a shoe shine man who, you know, who shines shoes. In the street, they got a stand. And he block hats, he finish up hats. In Europe, they use hats, men. So I go up to the guy and I said, \"Monsieur, 2\" He said, \"You can speak to me German, because your French is broken.\" I said, \"I get by with my French. I just start up with you. Do you know a family in Metz, Morris Davidovicz?\" He said, \"Morris Davidovicz, they were richest people in the Metz.\" My brother -- which is true. He know my brother, all the brothers and the sisters, this guy. They always took shoe shines with the guys. They know everything, you know, those guys. So I was not successful. I said, \"Do you me a favor. I give you my name and address and telephone in Germany where I was located, where I am now. I am in Landsberg am Lech. If they return, with God's will, I want you to tell them to come. I do everything for them. I pay them everything what they wanted in this.\" He came. When he came back about, let's see, about six weeks later, my brother came to my godmother's house. And they came and everybody, we was in Landsberg. There was about maybe 4,000 Jews, a Jewish camp, a free camp. Like bungalows, they got bungalows, they have mobile homes. You know, people live private. No more on the Nazis', you know, stuff free. And they said to me, \"Dave, your brother's over here from France.\" I said, \"You're crazy. What?\" And we was on the second floor, a two-story building. I don't know how I went. I think I fly, how I came down. I don't remember I walk with the steps, so anxious I was to see my brother. I look on my brother, he look like my mother. One piece, I don't him. I really don't know him. I really don't know him. Maybe I was maybe four years old. How can I recognize a person so many years? I said, \"Morris, what language you speak?\" He said, \"Three languages. I speak French, I speak Jewish and I speak Germany.\" And I start talking to him, and he said to me, \"Who survived from the mishpocha, from the family?\" Mishpocha is in Hebrew. \"Who survive from the family?\" He said, \"Me and Gustav.\" \"What happened my sisters, Bella, Frencha, Freda? What happened with them?\" At the last minute, the Nazis, they send them to a concentration camp. They never show up back. We cry with this and this. So he said to me, \"Dave, I want you do for me one thing. One thing. I need a pair of glasses. I cannot see. I'm looking on the look. I lost my vision and everything.\" I said, \"I give you a pair of glasses.\" I went to people who tipped me off who was the optometrist, whatever it is, in the eyeglasses' business. They have the Germans. They don't have nothing, nothing. They cry we have nothing. I said, \"Look, don't you go out and tell me you don't have nothing. I know you got in cellar, and you better give it to me right away.\" And I went down and the guy came, and he give. He went and when he put on the glasses, he said, \"God, you bring me new eyes. I never forget you.\""

They make five dozens; I make 15 dozens, what I did. So right away, I got guts to go into the boss. I said, \"I cannot work for 50 cents an hour. I got a little baby, and I got a wife.\" He said, \"I give you 75.\" And he start up, you know, the guy speak Jewish, was a Jewish foreman.

Two weeks later, I want a dollar, because I know I deserve. He said, \"It's too bad. If you cannot make by this.\" They like to make me foreman. They offer me $5 an hour in this place. Can you imagine this? In eight months. I accept. Later I look for a different job. Culture job, job what I know best. I was in printing lithography and four-color separation. War is the biggest criminal for people who make the war. They should be punished because they provoke and they organize the wars, is the number one. After this what happened in Hitler's time, after 50 years, no improvement. We got the Ku Klux Klan. We got militias. They kill senators, congressmen, policeman, everybody. Is no law and order and they don't get what they deserve. We have to bring America to culture, to rehabilitate those criminals to make them people. All the jails, they full with criminals with raping, no respect for women, no respect for kids. Women classified as second citizens. They never was in the history in a country, what they do. And this has to be stopped once forever. We don't want no more concentration camps. We don't -- we have to go to basic to bring America -- and history, if they bring America to this tradition what America is supposed to be, there will be no more concentration camp. The history will recognize American -- what America supposed to be and what our Constitution said what the citizen, every citizen, should benefit from America because everybody deserve the same thing.
