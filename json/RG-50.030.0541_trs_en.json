There were a lot of other things I probably didn\u2122t have, but he \u0152 i \u0152 he \u0152 hi-his Interview with Lili Brody-Carmosino October 15, 2009 39responsibility \u0152 death would have gotten to him unless he to \u0152 his job was to take care of me. And he did as be st as I could, but I remember getting into fights, which was not my nature. But the kids, I guess, were making fun of \u0152 I couldn\u2122t \u0152 I could speak all these other languages, and the te acher, of course, all loved me. Couldn\u2122t be \u0152 didn\u2122t \u0152 didn\u2122t know where to place me, because so much school was missed. And somebody called me, I don\u2122t know if it was dirty Jew or something, and I-I just jumped on her, oh, I \u0152 I wa \u0152 i-it wa \u0152 just wasn\u2122t \u0152 the anger came out of me like an animal, and I remember my brother peeling me off of this girl. And I remember going to the principal\u2122s office, or somebody. And they \u0152 I couldn \u2122t speak to them, I couldn\u2122t tell them. And, the [indecipherable] came down, and he said, why did you do it? And I remember yelling, I\u2122m Jewish, I\u2122m Jewish. And that\u2122s the only part I remember is, I\u2122m Jewish. But the girl didn\u2122t do it because I was Jewish, but I couldn\u2122t understand why she was picking on me, and making fun and laughing. So the answer, it did, it hardened me. And even though my brother was to look after me, I realized that it\u2122s time to look after myse lf, this is going to happen. And I\u2122ll just have to fill my own shoes, because he\u2122s two years older, he\u2122s now in another grade, and this is life. This is life, and we\u2122re very lucky, and you know, I can\u2122t be his responsibility and actually it started to take hold, and I made my own friends and learned the language faster then, and skip ped two, three grades. Fortunately, I guess Interview with Lili Brody-Carmosino October 15, 2009 40I had a brain because it start \u0152 they didn\u2122t know where to put me. They started off with first grade, and then I think the last was third grade. And then fourth \u0152 by fourth grade, I remember by then I was speaking English, made my friends, gave my brother a breathing room where he could go with his friends. But it made me bitter. Bitter, not \u0152 definitely bitter against the Germans, which, they weren\u2122t \u0152 it made me very \u0152 to this day I have no love, and you can\u2122t blame th e whole, and I mean, I hate the language. And ironically enough, even as I got a job in public health nursing and put myself through school, I used the German lan \u0152 I had to use the German language to be in a clinic, to interpret to German refugees in Toronto, Canada , of what to do with their babies. And a couple of times, I literally messed up, and I knew I messed up, and I didn\u2122t even, God forg ive me, resent it. I really didn't \u0152 I didn't feel bad about \u0152 not that I told her th e wrong thing, I just said to her, in \u0152 in German, can\u2122t understand, na \u0152 na [German] fa \u0152 you know, mixing Jewish with \u0152 and they \u0152 it\u2122s like I \u0152 I guess my best way of inter \u0152 I mixed the ger \u0152 Jewish with the German deliberately. I wanted them to know I\u2122m a Jew, and I\u2122m helping you speak this language for your baby. What did you do for us? That\u2122s where I was wrong.

And I applied to Manpower or something, and my typing was excellent. A nd ended up doing typing. And then my languages opened up doors again.

And because of my languages, a friend called and says, Lili, you know how speak Yiddish fluently, and German and a little bit of Russian and Polish. There\u2122s a job opening at the Jewish center for the hot lunch program that consis ts of like 150 people. You have to do programming, it\u2122s quite involved.

The other two were in sc hool, and I\u2122ll work around the kids. And ironically enough, I went to sign her up, and I was sitting on the floor, reading her a book til I could get the director. And I had three or four kids on my lap, a couple on my back, and I\u2122m reading these books and these kids are all over me, and I think, what the heck? And she says to me, would you \u0152 well, what\u2122d you come here for? Interview with Lili Brody-Carmosino October 15, 2009 60And I says, to sign up my daughter. And sh e says, well, I\u2122ve got a better idea. You come work for us. You see? So I ended up having a full time job, my daughter got in free, and I started to work for the daycare.

But, my husband decided it\u2122s \u0152 it \u0152 that\u2122s enough. It was every eat \u0152 when I worked for the Jewish Center, I was in the paper, because I was talking to governors and mayors and what have you. Whether that threat ened him, I don\u2122t know, and I was in the paper, and then when I ope \u0152 started with this adaptive clothing for the handicapped, again it was, you know, ribbon cutting, and that did it, it was just \u0152 I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m exposed, and there\u2122s just too much. So then, I think there was another job I was applying to, and that was \u0152 there were \u0152 I loved physical fitness and people, so I applied at, I remember, the YMCA in Hamden, Connecticut. And I thought, there\u2122s no way I\u2122m gonna get it, I mean, this is director for \u0152 and he says, I\u2122m very interested. And I came home to tell my husband that I\u2122m going to possibly \u0152 you know, I \u0152 I interviewed and there\u2122s a good chance, that was the end of my married life, and what have you, and he says, no you\u2122re not, you\u2122re coming to work at Brody Printing Company. If you\u2122re so great, you can prove it to me. And that was a bad move, because I found the things \u0152 this was not the man I was married to, and Interview with Lili Brody-Carmosino October 15, 2009 62working for him was not the things to do because the way he talked to people and handled people is the way he hated other people handling him, not to get involved. And the marriage fell apart. And you ready? I was there with well, not three, because my daughter moved out, my oldest daughter, and she went to college, and so did the middle one. And the marriage \u0152 we went to Israel, my treat. The only way the kids went on vacation is if I paid for it. And this was a wealthy man, who really didn\u2122t like kids, but he wasn\u2122t a bad father, he just wasn\u2122t around, so I was basically a single mom anyway. The reason I\u2122m saying this, and there is where the Holocaust, and my experience is making me what I am, I\u2122m grateful for. What does a woman do with no credit cards, two children, three to take care of, had a beautiful home, went on vacations, now I\u2122m alone, beca use the silence was deafening, the relationship fell apart, and I kept on saying \u0152 you know, I \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I go on vacations, I have a beautiful home, three beautiful children, what\u2122s going on, why am I unhappy? There was no conv ersation, it was \u0152 everything fell apart. There was no interaction, and I was going into depressi on and I ended up div \u0152 taking the family, the last hurrah, to Israel, where I met the cousin who split my head. And there were, I think, 12 of us at a table, and because my husband was well off at the time \u0152 and I treated, with 7,000 dolla rs for that trip, and the best trip ever. And we got \u0152 the kids got to see Israel. I met my \u0152 the family that was left over. And that \u0152 that was it, Interview with Lili Brody-Carmosino October 15, 2009 631985, I went on my own. When we came back, the marriage was over, unbeknownst to me, there was somebody else for 15 years."
