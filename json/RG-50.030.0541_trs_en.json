And he did as best as I could, but I remember getting into fights, which was not my nature. But the kids, I guess, were making fun of \u2014 I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I could speak all these other languages, and the teacher, of course, all loved me. Couldn\u2019t be \u2014 didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t know where to place me, because so much school was missed. And somebody called me, I don\u2019t know if it was dirty Jew or something, and I-I just jumped on her, oh, I \u2014 I wa \u2014 1-1t wa \u2014 just wasn\u2019t \u2014 the anger came out of me like an animal, and I remember my brother peeling me off of this girl. And I remember going to the principal\u2019s office, or somebody. And they \u2014 I couldn\u2019t speak to them, I couldn\u2019t tell them. And, the [indecipherable] came down, and he said, why did you do it? And I remember yelling, I\u2019m Jewish, I\u2019m Jewish. And that\u2019s the only part I remember is, I\u2019m Jewish. But the girl didn\u2019t do 1t because I was Jewish, but I couldn\u2019t understand why she was picking on me, and making fun and laughing. So the answer, it did, it hardened me. And even though my brother was to look after me, I realized that it\u2019s time to look after myself, this 1s going to happen. And I\u2019Il just have to fill my own shoes, because he\u2019s two years older, he\u2019s now in another grade, and this is life. This is life, and we\u2019re very lucky, and you know, I can\u2019t be his responsibility and actually it started to take hold, and I made my own friends and learned the language faster then, and skipped two, three grades. Fortunately, I guess Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Lili Brody-Carmosino \u201d October 15, 2009 I had a brain because it start \u2014 they didn\u2019t know where to put me. They started off with first grade, and then I think the last was third grade. And then fourth \u2014 by fourth grade, I remember by then I was speaking English, made my friends, gave my brother a breathing room where he could go with his friends. But 1t made me bitter. Bitter, not \u2014 definitely bitter against the Germans, which, they weren\u2019t \u2014 it made me very \u2014 to this day I have no love, and you can\u2019t blame the whole, and I mean, I hate the language. And ironically enough, even as I got a job in public health nursing and put myself through school, I used the German lan \u2014 I had to use the German language to be in a clinic, to interpret to German refugees in Toronto, Canada, of what to do with their babies. And a couple of times, I literally messed up, and I knew I messed up, and I didn\u2019t even, God forgive me, resent it. I really didn't \u2014 I didn't feel bad about \u2014 not that I told her the wrong thing, I just said to her, in \u2014 in German, can\u2019t understand, na \u2014 na [German] fa \u2014 you know, mixing Jewish with \u2014 and they \u2014 it\u2019s like I\u2014 I guess my best way of inter \u2014 I mixed the ger \u2014 Jewish with the German deliberately. I wanted them to know I\u2019m a Jew, and I\u2019m helping you speak this language for your baby. What did you do for us? That\u2019s where I was wrong.

And I would go to different schools, and there was one, you know, some kids were wheelchair bound, couldn\u2019t talk, one was sign language. And I would work one on one \u2014 one on one with them. That was another job. After that 1t was a multitude of incredible jobs, I don\u2019t know how I got them. Dad had to go, because now the kids were all in school, and I thought, well, it\u2019s time to go on. I believe, if I\u2019m not mistaken, I worked for a bank. And that was again up to three o\u2019clock, and be home for the kids. From the bank, I thought, well, let\u2019s see what else I can do, I love people. I went to work for, happened to be two Jewish ladies, physical therapy. I was a wer \u2014 answered the phone. It\u2019s \u2014 and I ended up giving physical therapy, which I didn\u2019t want to do, but she says, you\u2019ve got some nursing background. I ended up doing physical therapy, which I shouldn\u2019t have done. And then, next thing I know is this friend of theirs wanted to open up this thing, adaptive clothing for the handicapped. And she had \u2014 that\u2019s when Velcro first came in."

            "question": "Right. Interview with Lili Brody-Carmosino \" October 15, 2009",
            "answer": "And she said, what do you think, Lili? So the one who owned the physical, she says, I want you to meet this woman who came in, I think it was either Las Vegas, or I-I\u2019m not even sure where she lived, califor \u2014 someplace. She was a wonderful lady, we hit it off immediately. And she says, will you work with me on this, and we\u2019 ll \u2014 somehow or other I got involved with her, and we opened up this thing. But, my husband decided it\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 that\u2019s enough. It was every eat \u2014 when I worked for the Jewish Center, I was in the paper, because I was talking to governors and mayors and what have you. Whether that threatened him, I don\u2019t know, and I was in the paper, and then when I ope \u2014 started with this adaptive clothing for the handicapped, again it was, you know, ribbon cutting, and that did it, it was just \u2014 ?m\u2014I\u2019m exposed, and there\u2019s just too much. So then, I think there was another job I was applying to, and that was \u2014 there were \u2014 I loved physical fitness and people, so I applied at, I remember, the YMCA in Hamden, Connecticut. And I thought, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m gonna get it, I mean, this 1s director for \u2014 and he says, I\u2019m very interested. And I came home to tell my husband that I\u2019m going to possibly \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I interviewed and there\u2019s a good chance, that was the end of my married life, and what have you, and he says, no you\u2019re not, you\u2019re coming to work at Brody Printing Company. If you\u2019re so great, you can prove it to me. And that was a bad move, because I found the things \u2014 this was not the man I was married to, and Interview with Lili Brody-Carmosino \u00b0* October 15, 2009 working for him was not the things to do because the way he talked to people and handled people is the way he hated other people handling him, not to get involved. And the marriage fell apart. And you ready? I was there with well, not three, because my daughter moved out, my oldest daughter, and she went to college, and so did the middle one. And the marriage \u2014 we went to Israel, my treat. The only way the kids went on vacation 1s if I paid for it. And this was a wealthy man, who really didn\u2019t like kids, but he wasn\u2019t a bad father, he just wasn\u2019t around, so I was basically a single mom anyway. The reason I\u2019m saying this, and there is where the Holocaust, and my experience 1s making me what I am, I\u2019m grateful for. What does a woman do with no credit cards, two children, three to take care of, had a beautiful home, went on vacations, now I\u2019m alone, because the silence was deafening, the relationship fell apart, and I kept on saying \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I \u2014I\u2014I go on vacations, I have a beautiful home, three beautiful children, what\u2019s going on, why am I unhappy? There was no conversation, it was \u2014 everything fell apart. There was no interaction, and I was going into depression and I ended up div \u2014 taking the family, the last hurrah, to Israel, where I met the cousin who split my head. And there were, I think, 12 of us at a table, and because my husband was well off at the time \u2014 and I treated, with 7,000 dollars for that trip, and the best trip ever. And we got \u2014 the kids got to see Israel. I met my \u2014 the family that was left over. And that \u2014 that was it, Interview with Lili Brody-Carmosino \u201c October 15, 2009 1985, I went on my own. When we came back, the marriage was over, unbeknownst to me, there was somebody else for 15 years."
