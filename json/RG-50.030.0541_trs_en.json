My father never did cold cuts, ne \u2014 my mother never really worked, other than tailoring. And oh how he hated it. It was not his trade. And then it actually became comical, because the little bit they made, half of his salary, say if he got 10 dollars, five had to go back to the Jewish Federation. We know for a fact the clothes were donations. And I\u2019m not putting down the Jewish fe \u2014 but every single paycheck, they had to pay back. And we wore hand-me-down clothes. I do remember this wonderful, wonderful teacher, and we moved \u2014 we had SIX moves in one year, til they managed to save some money.

And I applied to Manpower or something, and my typing was excellent. And ended up doing typing. And then my languages opened up doors again. My children were born and then I stopped working, and my husband was in the printing business. And because of my languages, a friend called and says, Lili, you know how speak Yiddish fluently, and German and a little bit of Russian and Polish. There\u2019s a job opening at the Jewish center for the hot lunch program that consists of like 150 people. You have to do programming, it\u2019s quite involved. I said, I don\u2019t know, because my husband didn\u2019t want me to work. Went down, I applied, got the job, was able to take \u2014 I was not allowed to work unless I brought \u2014 til my kids were in school, home for the kids after school, those were the rules. And that was fine. So I brought my little one, which is my youngest, Stacey with me, and I remember loving work, just loving it. Prior to that \u2014 oh, after that, I remember \u2014 I thought, okay, I did that, she came with me. Now it\u2019s time to put her in a daycare and I will put her in a daycare and get myself a job. The other two were in school, and Ill work around the kids. And ironically enough, I went to sign her up, and I was sitting on the floor, reading her a book til I could get the director. And I had three or four kids on my lap, a couple on my back, and I\u2019m reading these books and these kids are all over me, and I think, what the heck? And she says to me, would you \u2014 well, what\u2019d you come here for? This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And she says, well, I\u2019ve got a better idea. You come work for us. You see? So I ended up having a full time job, my daughter got in free, and I started to work for the daycare. After that, I just loved working, and I end \u2014 from there, I went to work for special ed, as an aide. And because of my grades and what have you, I found myself working one on one, and I absolutely loved it. And I would go to different schools, and there was one, you know, some kids were wheelchair bound, couldn\u2019t talk, one was sign language. And I would work one on one \u2014 one on one with them. That was another job. After that 1t was a multitude of incredible jobs, I don\u2019t know how I got them. Dad had to go, because now the kids were all in school, and I thought, well, it\u2019s time to go on. I believe, if I\u2019m not mistaken, I worked for a bank. And that was again up to three o\u2019clock, and be home for the kids. From the bank, I thought, well, let\u2019s see what else I can do, I love people. I went to work for, happened to be two Jewish ladies, physical therapy. I was a wer \u2014 answered the phone. It\u2019s \u2014 and I ended up giving physical therapy, which I didn\u2019t want to do, but she says, you\u2019ve got some nursing background. I ended up doing physical therapy, which I shouldn\u2019t have done. And then, next thing I know is this friend of theirs wanted to open up this thing, adaptive clothing for the handicapped. And she had \u2014 that\u2019s when Velcro first came in."

She was a wonderful lady, we hit it off immediately. And she says, will you work with me on this, and we\u2019 ll \u2014 somehow or other I got involved with her, and we opened up this thing.

And the marriage \u2014 we went to Israel, my treat. The only way the kids went on vacation 1s if I paid for it. And this was a wealthy man, who really didn\u2019t like kids, but he wasn\u2019t a bad father, he just wasn\u2019t around, so I was basically a single mom anyway.
