Can you talk a little bit more about, I mean, obviously that\u2122s how you survived, right?",
            "answer": "W as because we were not betrayed. I need to stress, I, what, what my sense about Holland during the war was based on, based on history, basically, data and in retrospect, is that there was a small percentage perhaps five, five percent, if that many who act ively tried to help Jews if, I\u2122m not sure there were that many, who were, who risked their own lives. And they were truly the noble, the very noble people, because it\u2122s hard to ask people to do that for others. So, about five percent perhaps that, I\u2122m no t even sure it was, were that many, that actually, actively did something. My feeling is that 80 percent didn\u2122t care. I\u2122m not saying that they would have betrayed but also that they didn\u2122t care. But we had a significant, I would say fifty to twenty per cent who were traitors. A huge percentage that were part of the, they belonged to the NS Bay(ph) which is the National Socialist Party, actively, who actively worked with the, with the Nazis, with the Germans and betrayed Jews. Most Dutch Jews probably were betrayed by Dutch rather than those were in hiding. I think they, they said something like 35,000 were in hiding, 15,000 were betrayed. Anita Frank 4 [Date not labeled] Page 4 That\u2122s a significant number. Probably mostly by the Dutch. Dutch people who got a few dollars for it, a few gui lders which the Dutch thing. They got guilders so each person had a, had a monetary value attached. And Holland only now is coming to terms with the fact that as a, as a people, they were not, they were not all that, I hate to say this, they were not al l that different from the German people in that a lot of them just turned their heads. Most just turned their heads, let it happen."

Our, my, my mother, because she came from a very wealthy family had, had, we\u2122d lived Anita Frank 12 [Date not labeled] Page 12 in this house and my mother had all these gorgeous things which were all mostly taken away, also by Dutch people who didn\u2122t r eturn them to us after the war. \ufb01After all,\ufb02 they said, \ufb01you gave them to us.\ufb02 And so, like my parents knew who had taken the, the bedroom set, which was a gorgeous bedroom set, people absolutely refused to return these things to us. It\u2122s hard to believ e that Dutch people, _______ support from what they called the __________ Commission or something like that so we got a little bit of money but that was not until I think a year afterwards which allowed my parents to buy some furniture. We never got any r eparation, we were never got a penny for what happened to us during the war. Not from the Nazis, not from the, not from the Germans, we call them Nazis, not from the Germans, not from the Dutch government, except a, a little bit that allowed my parents to buy some furniture. And, and the reason we survived the war was not because my parents had any money but my, my aunt and uncle in, in Ossin(ph), my father\u2122s sister and her husband who had been very close to my parents. They made money available to us a nd their two daughters survived the war. One is the, and one tragically killed herself after the war. Another, another consequence of the war. And, and, and, they in effect allowed my parents to survive because my parents did have to pay for us. Not much, but they paid the Bookas(ph), I saw the, I saw the records, they paid the Bookas(ph) to have us stay there. And of course they had to live themselves. But that was made possible because my aunt and uncle who tragically were taken out of, they were b oth very ill and taken out of the hospital and put in cattle cars and died before they got to, to Poland. And that, and so that money was gone by the end of Anita Frank 13 [Date not labeled] Page 13 the war and it was, it was very rough financially, there was no money until my father sort of got back into selling some stuff and so we lived carefully. And, and then when he got his new job, he did okay, he did, actually remember one year we actually made enough on commissions that we had a little bit of extra which allowed me to go to Paris, in 1940. I was fifteen so that must have been 1951, before we came to America. One of the soldiers who had been in the Liberation Army in Lindbergh(ph), a wonderful young man, Jewish, and we had stayed in touch with him and he\u2122d gone back to America, married a journalist. And they went to Paris. They, and they lived in Paris and invited one of us, and as the oldest girl I had privilege, to come and spend six weeks in Paris. And I remember, finally, my parents having little bit of extra money they could affo rd the train fare to, to Paris. It was a big adventure and it was the same summer they were able to rent a, a cabin on the beach. So I remember there was the one summer that we had a little bit of money.

My mother was, she had some help and my aunt, my mother\u2122s only sister, they had gotten her out of Germany in 1936 so she lived with us for awhile and my parents, and my mother\u2122s parents lived with us. So I think my mother\u2122s mother did much of the cooking until she died in 1938. But it was the Dutch eat potatoes and the, the staples really were bread and potatoes and a littl e bit of meat, porridge, food like that, vegetables. But meat was very Anita Frank 14 [Date not labeled] Page 14 expensive. Eggs were very expensive so you didn\u2122t have much of that so it was mostly the carbohydrates. And then during the war, I remember very clearly getting minute portions of butter, it was margarine, just like perhaps two tablespoons of butter, that, the margarine had to last us the whole week. So, I, I, what I remember were the, the extreme small rations we had and how you had to just be so careful that you just took a littl e bit and put that on your bread. And, and again, mostly what we ate were bread, potatoes. That, that was most of our staples. It was, I think severe vitamin I think we lacked, had severe vitamin deficiency. Not, probably not protein, not, protein yes but not calorie deficiency but certainly vitamin deficiencies which manifested itself in me when I was in 1943, we went to visit our parents for Christmas. It was the first time we went to see them and we were hit by a sleigh. We were watching people com ing down the hill and we were hit by a sleigh and it made a huge gash in my leg and it got horrendously infected and that infection lasts from Christmas to Easter. And I remember Betty taking me to the doctor every week. I just had sores all over my legs and I just didn\u2122t heal. And I think that had to do with, just deficiencies, vitamin deficiencies, more susceptible to illness. And then after the war, there were severe shortages again so really the whole time that I was in Holland until \u212252, things were rationed. I can remember seeing my first orange, getting it from the Americans, as first orange. Seeing my first pineapple in 1949 or so, in a store which was just sort of put there prominently and I not knowing what a pineapple was, so very simple foods after the war when, after things became, Holland was in horrendous shape because of the war. And it took a long time and Anita Frank 15 [Date not labeled] Page 15 that\u2122s where the Marshall Plan was so incredibly helpful. It took a long time for the economies of Europe to begin to recover from the horrors. And I can remember, we would have meat once a week. And we\u2122d have one chicken which we\u2122d divide and we\u2122d get just a little piece and we\u2122d have an egg if we were lucky once a week.

Okay, so these, these, the feelings and that, that, so that involved fear and also it was because during the war, I, I had this real sense that I had to be perfect, that I couldn\u2122t make any mistakes, that I couldn\u2122t do anything wrong, I mean that was, as long as I just stayed perfect, that wouldn\u2122t, I wouldn\u2122t be killed. I mean, I woul dn\u2122t betray myself, or even more so, as long as I stayed perfect, nobody would betray me to the Germans, nobody would think I was a bad person and, and betray me to the Germans. And that sense of having to be this perfect child became part of who I, who I , I was after the war. And it meant that I couldn\u2122t assert myself. I was afraid of, I was afraid of asserting myself. And I remember having a feeling of, crazy, that I saw other children doing, doing bad, quote, bad things, not terribly bad but being disobedient or being rude and I can remember thinking, and I was about 11 years old. I can remember thinking, why can\u2122t I be like that? Why can\u2122t I be a little bit bad? So, so, clearly, there was, there remained an overriding fear in me that I had to be, I had to be good, I had to be perfect, otherwise something bad was going to happen to me. But there was also something in me already that said why can\u2122t I be like other children? And, and that, that need to please others, that need not to disagree with o thers stayed with me. And then, I remember one occasion. We were playing ball on the street. Tennis balls, we had tennis balls. And a woman Anita Frank 17 [Date not labeled] Page 17 was riding her bicycle and she, she hit one of the balls and she fell and she was pregnant. And she, she ripped her stockings. And I can remember, she came and she was really angry at us and I can remember saying to her, \ufb01Well, you should have looked out,\ufb02 or something like that. I was being rude and it was like, it was almost like something in me said, now is your opportunity to be rude and it was most inappropriate really. I mean I chose the wrong person and then, but she came into our house. My mother was very felt, was very apologetic and paid for new stockings and stuff like that. And thank heavens the bab y wasn\u2122t harmed. But, but I can remember that was my one moment of rudeness. But the way, the way this came out was, and I mentioned that, was that I became immobilized in school. I stopped learning. It was just like something in me got just so blocke d is, the ability to be who I really was. And I\u2122m not saying I\u2122m a a bad person or I wanted to be rude, but I, this, this sort of need to, to, to speak up for what you think or what you want didn\u2122t have, I, I just couldn\u2122t do that so that sort of came out then in school where I just became emotionally, just horrendously blocked. I couldn\u2122t, couldn\u2122t study, couldn\u2122t work and there, not being this perfect person, not being this top student which I always have been, I, I, that was just something I had no con trol over, I felt, so, I, I felt very bad about it because I knew I disappointed my father because he had such high expectations of me. But at least I felt I had no control over that."

            "answer": "It, what was key was that after , after coming to America and having my ego totally destroyed, I feel, no, that\u2122s nonsense. Having my ego severely damaged even further by Henry Coster(ph) who, I, I think I told that story where, basically he, when I, when I was promised I could go to the opening of the rope(ph) and then was told to stay home with Peter because he was sick and, I, I dared, here, for the first time, I dared complain. I dared express some of my needs and that was literally the first time I\u2122d done that. Since, since the war because I had been so careful, I have no needs. I just, I just managed, I just coped. I had no needs. So there, I, first time that I remember basically going to Peggy Coster(ph) and saying, \ufb01I\u2122m really sad, I really, I really had been looking forward to this and I\u2122m really unhappy.\ufb02 And then Peggy telling Henry Coster(ph) that I had complained and Henry Coster(ph) calling me in and telling me I had no right to do that. That devastated me. That absolutely confirmed the fact that I had no right. I ha d no right to complain. I had no right to express my feelings or express my needs and it, that stayed with me for years and years and years and make me feel I had no value. Until I went to the Soviet Union and with, and Elizabeth Dixon(ph) was there on the second exhibit, no it was the first exhibit, and where in effect she seemed to really like me. And she was lonely there and she was a real friend to me and I, she provided me with a home and I remember very distinctly thinking she is a person of value. She values me so there must be some value to me. I, I absolutely went through those thought processes. And then that, that was enormous boost to me, that she\u2122d really cared about me, the first person in this country to really do so. And that was a lon g time after I\u2122d been here, Anita Frank 20 [Date not labeled] Page 20 that was in 1962. That was ten years, ten years after I\u2122d come to this country, that, that\u2122s, that\u2122s when I really began to feel there had to be something worthwhile in me."

Because eventually allowed me to come, become the person who I am today. Tragically, he, so there I\u2122m very grateful to him. But tragically, he was, he\u2122s part of this Hollywood garbage dump. And, and what a fake life those people lead. Nothing i s real, nothing is authentic. I\u2122m exaggerating as usual. But very little is authentic and, and, even, na\u00efve and innocent as I was when I came to California, living in this fake environment, even I knew that these people weren\u2122t real. Even I knew that these expressions of interest meant nothing. And so he, he did not, and I\u2122m not blaming him, but he clearly and neither did Peggy, I think, Peggy is a, was a sweet, she was always very sweet, I need to stress that. But, but Henry ruled the roost. And I do n\u2122t think he had any sense of what was going on with me at all. And I don\u2122t know whether I can blame him for that or not. I don\u2122t blame because I don\u2122t hold him, he did what he knew how. But you know, you live, you grow up in that world of fakery and yo u grow up in that, you live in that world where all these people play pretend and so little is real and people don\u2122t even know what is real and what is not real. And I gather there now, there\u2122s a group now, stars that may have a somewhat stronger grip on reality. But in those days, it was just about as fake as Anita Frank 21 [Date not labeled] Page 21 you could imagine.

Again, they never had an opportun ity to talk about anything so they, like the rest of us, they just did what was expected of them. And they came to America for us and so my father, my mother who had never worked outside the house, took these job, first job was in a handbag, handbag facto ry. My father worked in a paint factory, got horrendous paint, lead poisoning there, practically died. They never did anything for him there. They had, cheap(ph) job as custodians, I mean, they had these, my mother worked as a nurse\u2122s aide in a hospital . Horrible jobs. Horrible jobs. Never complained. Never complained. Never even regretted having left Holland because even though that, it must have been just so hard for them to totally shift focus. They did it. They were totally remarkable and, and what, they did it for us. And they, I think all of us, perhaps all of us felt a strong obligation to our parents. That was never ever lost throughout that lifetime that, that we, we also made sure that when we became adults and we were capable, we took care of them.

Nice little house for about, until from 1965 until 1971, I think. And then my sister came with her husband. They, she had been in the Air Force in Thailand, and then they moved my parents, lock, stock and barrel to , to Florida. And then they lived with my sister there for 20 Anita Frank 25 [Date not labeled] Page 25 years.

Basically, what it meant to Europe. And, and the interviewer went to an ethnic restaurant, a German ethnic, in Chicago I think it was and talked to this woman and said, well they were celebrating, they were celebrating the wall coming dow n. And this interviewer saying to this woman, \ufb01Well, what do you think? There are some people who are deeply concerned about this wall coming down, about, in terms of what it means for a united Germany?\ufb02 And her response was, \ufb01Ahh, why can\u2122t they just forget it?\ufb02 I wanted to kill her.

Even though they\u2122d lost distant relatives, they were able to come with their families and build and have this wonderful extended family and how I envy them because they have got, they\u2122ve got the cousins and the aunts and the uncles. We don\u2122t. We had to start from scratch. We\u2122re starting with our little family and I must say, we lost more than most. We lost most, my father had seven brothers and sisters and only he and the older brother survived with some cousins. My mother had just one si ster and her daughter and they were murdered so, that, that leaves very little family. And so you come here and you start from scratch. _________ you start from scratch without your, but you also, you have the memories, you don\u2122t, you don\u2122t forget that. You live with that. I, there, rarely a day I don\u2122t think about my, my aunt or my cousins who were murdered. I just, that\u2122s not something you forget and every thing that reminds you of them makes, and those people who were killed in the concentration camps, those are not strangers, that\u2122s family. So you don\u2122t forget, you can\u2122t forget and you shouldn\u2122t forget. Anita Frank 30 [Date not labeled] Page 30"

                " Well, that\u2122s, that\u2122s sort of the million dollar question. The way I look at it is that, I think historically... End of Tape 1. Anita Frank 32 [Date not labeled] Page 32 Tape 2 ",
                " Well, you asked, you asked why, how, how was Hitler possible and, and I just, as I said we had answers to that, we \u2122d know better. But I mean I, when I put in context is, is we have had two years, two thousand years, perhaps that\u2122s a little bit, no, really two thousand of unmitigated anti -Semitism in, in, in Europe, perhaps 1500. But, certainly, the Crusades, the, th e Inquisition in Spain, I mean, blaming Jews for the plague. I mean it, all you have to do is go through European history and if you look at the Bible, this increasing anti -Semitism, this, this hatred of Jews. You see that developing in the Bible, it was n\u2122t, that was not the original, the original disciples were not, they were Jews themselves. But you see, as, as Rome became Christian, they of course had to, to blame Jesus\u2122 death, not on the, the, the, the Romans but they had to blame it on the Jews. And you see this shift, this shift in the Bible itself to an increasingly more anti -Semitic perspective about Jews as Christ killers. And that became the great montra(ph) in, in European Christianity. Both Catholicism, Lutheranism is Jews the Christ killer s, Jews the blood -suckers, the Jews the Damned, Jews are not gonna go to heaven, it\u2122s only the select Christians who somehow have got the one right answer who are gonna go, who are gonna go to heaven. And so you have the dominant religion which of course Christianity is, in, in Europe. You\u2122ve got the dominant religion saying of another group of people that they\u2122re damned and they\u2122re gonna go to hell and they\u2122re, they suck the blood of Christian children. It becomes, they become the, the Jews, the dirty Jews, the ones, the dangerous people and then of course with the, with the Christians curtailing the Anita Frank 33 [Date not labeled] Page 33 Jewish, the Jewish, the possibility for Jews, jobs, professions and so on, were in a, in effect, Jews can only be, they could lend money because it was dirt y for Christians to lend money. So they could do the dirty jobs. And then Jews become successful there, they\u2122re being killed because they did. They became the money lenders and you have Shakespeare and Merchant of Venice and Charlotan(ph), that perpetra ting those horrors. And, and so you\u2122ve got a whole culture of anti -Semitism which was, you have it in France with the Dryfuss(ph) Affair, I mean you have it all through Europe. In, in eastern Europe with the progroms, you have it all through Europe throu ghout with intermittent periods where in effect certain rulers(ph) who\u2122d be tolerant of the Jews because they could use them. So it wasn\u2122t unmitigated, I mean it wasn\u2122t totally consistent but it certainly was consistent over time with periods of, of, of s ome, of some allowance to, to let Jews live their lives and flourish. And I must say that\u2122s where Holland has had us, on the whole, a, a better history, not perfect but certainly a better history of tolerance for Jews because they did allow the Sofottic(p h) Jews with the Inquisition to come to Holland and Holland has had a relatively, extraodinarily wonderful history of, of religious freedom. And has allowed its Jews to live in relative peace. But in Germany, Germany with all of its, its effort that beco ming a nation -state which it didn\u2122t become until Bismarck with all of its in -fighting and then, and, and a population which is the same as in Holland, this, this, a population that has as its dogma the Christian belief that if you just, the Calvinistic belief if, if you just do everything right and you follow God\u2122s word and you do it, then good things are gonna come to you. And that basically, you obey. It\u2122s very Anita Frank 34 [Date not labeled] Page 34 important to do what you\u2122re told, not to question this sort of authoritarian, sort of ethic of, of, of children must listen to their parents, children must obey, children must not question. Father knows best. So you\u2122ve got this, this sort of a cultural pattern of not questioning what goes on, a religious pattern of, if something bad happens to people, they deserve it. And then a historical pattern of extreme anti -Semitism, then you\u2122ve got this great combination that when things go bad, as of course Hitler came to power after this horrendous inflation, well, first the defeat for Germany in World War I which was a horrendous blow to their morale and then, this, this terrible inflation that impoverished millions of people. What you do is you find a scapegoat. And Hitler, Hitler was always a rabid anti -Semite. But people become very vulnerable to, becoming comfortable to, yes, it\u2122s all the Jews\u2122 fault. Blame somebody else, I mean we do it in this country all the time, is blaming somebody else. Blame the immigrants. Blame, blame the illegal aliens. Blame everybody. Even blame outside terrorists when we\u2122re breeding our own terrorists. We have the militia who is so dangerous here. So you blame, you start blaming others. And then everybody else is doing it and it becomes really comfortable and then you obey orders and you don\u2122t question and you become self -satisfied and smug because things are getting better. It\u2122s not, not difficult then to understand the Jews, the traditional scapegoat in Europe became an obvious scapegoat here. And then with German propaganda, they did an unbelievable job of painting Jews as rats. As vermin. Destroying the fiber of the great Aryan nation. And that propaganda is, is staggering, you see some of those propaganda films. So you put all that together, it\u2122s Anita Frank 35 [Date not labeled] Page 35 not surprising. It\u2122s not difficult to make people hate o thers. And that\u2122s why for me, questioning, always questioning, never accepting what people tell you without really examining the validity of any of it and never allowing others to dictate your moral stands. It\u2122s just so vital. "

My son is involved with a lovely young woman who is Catholic and she wanted to, she decided she was gonna be Catholic, she wanted to be the best Catholic possible so she thought of becoming a nun. And then she said, \ufb01Well the n I better really go and know, read the Bible.\ufb02 And she said she started reading the Bible. And the more she read the Bible, the more she began to see the internal contradictions that, that the Bible is full of because she\u2122s a real scholar. She\u2122s a real intellect. And she said, she said, then she said she went to her friends and said, \ufb01Please convince me how to be a good Catholic,\ufb02 and none of her friends could convince her. And because basically, in order to be a good anything, you can\u2122t read, read th e Bible from a scholarly perspective. So I discussed it with some very lovely, lovely young people who are also devout, devoted Christians and I said, \ufb01Well, how do you deal with this? That the innumerable contradictions in the Bible.\ufb02 And they Anita Frank 41 [Date not labeled] Page 41 said, \ufb01Well, basically, it\u2122s important to study it but you can\u2122t go too far because what you need to have is you need to have faith that basically what the Bible tells you is correct. So you can\u2122t,\ufb02 they said, their words were, \ufb01the theologians who really examine the Bible carefully, they just, they just go too far.\ufb02 So there is a limit to what you, you can read the Bible but don\u2122t read the Bible too far and I gather in Catholicism this has been the thing. That\u2122s why you had the catechism because the catechism gives you the one correct line. Yes, and then this whole issue of control. As long as I tell what the right way is and if there\u2122s only one right way. and if you question, you\u2122re gonna be damned.

They\u2122ve, they\u2122ve seen the light and our, have become many ways Anita Frank 43 [Date not labeled] Page 43 probably among the most tolerant of all people in this world. I\u2122m very impressed with them, at least the ones I\u2122ve met. But, but you have to go to Catholic schools, very painful to be only non -Catholics and soon as, course soon as we were liberated there was, we could tell people we were Jewish, then there were immediately excluded. Dirty Jews, Christ killers. Right smack after we\u2122re liberated, the war wasn\u2122t even over. As long as we weren\u2122t Jewish, it was safe but as soon as we were freed and we became Jewish, it became unsafe again and so that\u2122s why we had to hide it. It wasn\u2122t safe to be Jewish in Holland and, and, it\u2122s very inte resting, I just read in the paper last week about a group of young Germans who want to atone for their parents\u2122 and grandparents\u2122, sins of, they, they have come to America because there are no Jews left in Germany or very few. They\u2122ve come to America to w ork in homes for the, for the aged. Really wonderful. I\u2122m so impressed. And they said that it\u2122s, they were so grateful that they were not, they were not judged here. They were so grateful that they were not damned here and they said it was also wonderf ul for them to get to know Jews because she said in Germany being a Jew is still bad. And I was saying yes, I know it. Even in Holland, people are uncomfortable with people who are Jewish. When I tell people I\u2122m Jewish, you can feel the discomfort. Not all, but some."

I remember once after the war, it must have been 1948 and we went at night. It was, I think, was it Yom Kippur or was it, may have been Yom Kippur, we went to, because then there was no, no Jewish community left, no temple, we went to a Jewish service. And we went at night when it was dark, so it was fallen, it was dark and it was just like we still had to be careful not to be seen.

And as far as I\u2122m concerned, most Jews who still live in Holland are stil l in hiding. I went to a conference in 1992, the first conference of the Hidden Children. Five hundred of us _______ were there, in Amsterdam, was a wonderful experience for me. And about a quarter of the Jews, the surviving Jews emigrated to, mostly to America, Canada, Australia and of course, Israel and, and so a bunch of us came back.

She survived because she escaped the Dutch concentration camp and she was there with her little sister. And, oh gosh, you think about this. She was there with little sister, she was there wh en her parents were taken to the concentration camps, taken out of the hospital, taken to Westerbork, and put on the train to Auschwitz and she begged them to please leave her little sister, was exactly my age, little, few months older, Lainie(ph) was her name. She begged them to Anita Frank 46 [Date not labeled] Page 46 please... [End of side 1 of tape 2]...___________ begged her, she, she was, she was, she was at Westerbork, the Dutch concentration camp, she was there when her parents then came. And they were both very sick and they first took the sick and they, to the gas chambers and she begged them to please leave Lainie(ph) with her because that somehow was still possible. Her parents insisted Lainie(ph) would go with them. To Auschwitz. That\u2122s what she has to live with. This hard. Whe n we were just in Holland right now, we went to the, May 4 th is Memorial Day and so we went to the Jewish Cemetery in Ossin(ph), which is, most of my father\u2122s family was all from northern Holland, from Ossin(ph), Emmen,(ph), Hoanigan(ph), that area, and t here was, we went to the Jewish, Jewish Cemetery in Holland which miraculously was not destroyed by the Nazis. And they have Memorial there, too, to the 500 Dutch Jews who were either taken to Auschwitz from that little town or those who died in the conce ntration camp in Westerbork and there is my aunt and my uncle and my, and her, and it\u2122s my, my cousin\u2122s sister and her parents. And so the great blessing of, of being America is at least I don\u2122t have the daily reminders of that either.

Yeah, my, they, they were my father\u2122s oldest brother who survived, he\u2122s the only one who survived, children. He had three children. Their son, Bertus(ph), w as I gather, just a wonderful young man. He was among the first one killed because he was on the train and made some anti -Nazi remark. When they found out he was a Jew, they were shot immediately. He had two daughters who all, they survived in hiding. Hetty(ph), the oldest, who just turned 80 as a matter, no, is turning 80 in August 16 th, she, she married and, and, she married in 1940, I think just before the war broke out. No, just after the war had broken out. She married July 4 th to a very nice guy and then she had a baby in 1942 and that baby was put in, in with hundreds of other, I don\u2122t know how many hundred, shuffled from one family to the next, her name is Betty, after her brother. And then there was Sarai(ph), who was 12 and they, they also, they survived on hidings like we did except I think they were, they were not out in the open the way we were. And so they, after the war, we came to America in 1952, Hetty(ph) and Herman(ph) came in 1953. And we left Holland because Holland just, just wa s not a good place to be in those days. And they, they came to California and did extraordinarily well. Her, she had then three children when the came and those three young ladies all married and have children and have sort of lived the American dreams. However, however, as far as I\u2122m concerned, there is horrendous damage in all of them because of the war. On the surface, they are the absolute, outstanding examples of survivors but I know, I know what horrendous pain they\u2122ve gone through and how, what h orrendous damage has been done.

            "answer": "I have to be very careful because what\u2122s interesting is that Hetty(ph) and Herman(ph) who I adore, just absolutely wonderfu l people, they did exactly what the rest of us did, is that forget it, forget it. Try to forget it, go on with your life. Don\u2122t talk about it, don\u2122t deal with it but for heaven\u2122s sakes, and I think that has been a hallmark for at least our family, is prove that the Germans, that the Nazis were wrong, prove that you\u2122re okay. Prove that you\u2122re a person of value. And so how do you prove that? By accomplishing things. And by golly, did they accomplish. But in that effort to accomplish, they, the children, except for the youngest, the two older girls had to fend for, had to fend for themselves a great deal and were to some extent neglected. And not because they wanted to do that but because they, they had, they felt they had to work so hard to, to make it in this country. And they did make in this country. And then all of that tension and all of the pain was never discussed so it, it affected their lives and these girls grew up knowing about their background partly but not dealing with it. Not, it, witho ut it being discussed. And so they become adults and they, they have to deal with it in, in their own way, and, and, again I don\u2122t wanna talk about their circumstances because that\u2122s not up to me to do so. But I know, because of my background, that treme ndous harm was done and that, there was enormous pain and my, the oldest one, Betty, who is, who, who was born during the war, I mean she knows it, she\u2122s done a lot of talking about it and, and she is aware of, of, she\u2122s aware of the horrendous pain. And she also\u2122s been trying, try Anita Frank 49 [Date not labeled] Page 49 to do her best and yet has not really actualized herself the way I, phenomenal potential, highly intelligent young woman. They all are very bright, very competent. But unlike my family, where my parents never were successful, though they spent, so they spent a lot of time with us, we, we have, I think, my sisters, we have all really truly actualized ourselves, intellectually, emotionally. I don\u2122t, except for the youngest, who came along young enough that I think her parents had more time for her, the other two just haven\u2122t. And I think it\u2122s causing, it\u2122s caused a lot of pain. And then the war years, again, the, the lack of open discussions, up until lately, up until just the last couple of years, means that there\u2122s all this s tuff in your background and you, you know something went wrong but you don\u2122t, you don\u2122t discuss it. You pretend everything is just perfect and wonderful and they\u2122re prototype of that. Everything is perfect and wonderful always. Particularly with Hetty and Herman(ph), when you talk to them, man, it\u2122s always perfect."

They, Ingrid i s two years, one year younger and Helga\u2122s two years younger. So, I was six when the war broke out, Ingrid\u2122s five and Helga was four and I have much better memories than, than they do. I also, I also developed myself intellectually, I\u2122m the, I\u2122m the only one who immediately went to college and then to graduate school and ended up with a PhD. They, I have enormous, enormous respect for my sisters. They, they both went to nursing school and became nurses. But then my youngest sister went on and went to c ollege and got her degree and then went on and became a, a nurse pediatric clinician. So, and this, she is a remarkable young lady, I mean was, she, all of us did very badly in Holland. Academically, all of us fell apart. And Helga, my youngest sister developed a horrendous thyroid condition and, and stopped learning and stopped, she just, oh, tense and miserable and unhappy. So when, so she didn\u2122t go to school anymore. So she was 14 and missed enormous amounts of school. We came to America, Anita Frank 51 [Date not labeled] Page 51 again tha nk God, and, and, and she, we came to America in December of \u212252 and the following summer, she was operated on in Jewish hospital and they took out this huge goiter. It was benign and she grew five inches. She was just tiny developed and went back to sc hool and she\u2122s a very bright young lady. But she had to, whereas I sort of followed the classic route high school and college and graduate school, she, they went to nursing school which doesn\u2122t really, in those days, she didn\u2122t go to the university but to a hospital nursing program so they never had the chance to really develop their, oh how do I say this, their intellect in a way that I had. And so they did it later and then Ingrid also went to college and ended up as a, she, she graduated also from coll ege so they, in their adulthood, they did phenomenally and Helga, my youngest sister is, has just done spectacularly. She worked for the World Council of Nurses and does workshops around the world on delivering primary care in underserved areas. She is a expert on, on infant and maternal healthcare."

            "answer": "You know we all have different backgrounds. I was the child who tried to be perfect, so I had this total sense of worthl essness so my recovery had to be believing myself again. My middle sister, I don\u2122t think, I mean my middle sister has also accomplished a great deal. Build a business but I think still suffers tremendously from low self -esteem, a lack of self -worth. So I don\u2122t think, I don\u2122t think she has recovered and they have not dealt with it as extensively. My youngest sister, it\u2122s hard for me to say. She functions exquisitely. She is married, has four children, is a grandmother, just, just also has fulfilled the American dream. A wonderful mother, Anita Frank 52 [Date not labeled] Page 52 wonderful grandmother, but also I don\u2122t think has, we can talk. She and I can talk. But I don\u2122t think she has worked as extensively as I have at sort of making all the connections so I cannot, okay, the way, and so t he way it manifested for her that she, like me, when she was raising her children, she also had to be perfect. She also had to do everything right. She also had to cope. She also never could complain. She\u2122s another one of those, and so is my middle sis ter too, unbelievable women who just do. Just like my mother. But in the process of doing for others, that\u2122s not so hot either because then your children don\u2122t really get the message that they need to do for themselves so what we have done to our childre n, we\u2122ve done too much for our children. And I think that I, more than the others, was aware of that. I think that\u2122s the big difference, that in raising our son, that I would, that I was over, I was overprotective of him but from the very beginning I would say to him, \ufb01Loren(ph), this is my problem, not your problem. I am sorry that I need to know where you are all the time. It\u2122s not because I don\u2122t trust you, it\u2122s because inside of me, I cannot still cannot believe that you\u2122re really, that, that you\u2122re gonna be with me. That I just to know. So please, please understand where I\u2122m coming from.\ufb02 So from the very beginning I, I would, I would, when I did those things that could have been destructive, I let Loren(ph) know that it wasn\u2122t his fault and that was my problem and because he is so incredibly bright and sensitive, he understood and tolerated that. So he, he has all his life been willing to, to work with me and let me know where he is, I mean that\u2122s been the major thing. Let, just let me know whe re you are and he\u2122s always done so, throughout his adolescence. If he would be late, he\u2122d call me up. Never Anita Frank 53 [Date not labeled] Page 53 resented it. And, and I think part of it was that I let him know that, I let him know what my problems were because of the war. My overprotectiv eness, my fear of losing him. Whereas my sisters, I think did the same thing but in a, they, they didn\u2122t quite communicate all these ideas to their children. Now the kids have been, they\u2122re fine but, but, but whereas Loren(ph) has extraordinarily high se lf-esteem, extraordinarily, I mean, is so confident about who he is and so directed and so purposeful and so at peace with himself. I, he is, he is a, he\u2122s one of the healthiest people I\u2122ve ever met in my life. And I think that a lot of it has to do with , with my understanding of my own neuroses.

It is when people are mad at you, it\u2122s not to say oh my gosh, I\u2122m a bad person but to say, oh, you\u2122re mad at me. Well, who\u2122s problem is it? Is it your problem, is it really something I\u2122ve done? If it\u2122s something I\u2122ve done, that\u2122s something I can learn from. What do I need to, I need to work on changing that so it\u2122s not closing myself off from others, it\u2122s remaining open to the input that others give me but at a very, on a very limited basis. Because I recognize that everybody else is probably crazier than I am and to let other people define me, hah! What a joke that is. I mean we, the Nazis defined us as dirty, filthy Jews worthy of extermination. No one will ever define me again. So it\u2122s partly again, it\u2122s a reaction to that. Nobody will define me. I will define myself. But within the context of my environment so to avoid becoming this extreme narcissist, you, you want to remain open to input but you want to weigh it against what you know about yourself. That\u2122s, and this way you keep on growing and the, and the most wonderful thing is the more at peace you are with yourself, the nicer you can be to other people. You don\u2122t, cause you don\u2122t have to destroy others to feel good about yourself. As a matter of fact, it hurts you to be negative or destructive to others and so you know that those who are destructive, there\u2122s something wrong with them. Because if you truly feel good about yourself, you don\u2122t, you don\u2122t want to hurt others, cause it hurts you if you are. Anita Frank 57 [Date not labeled] Page 57"

I broke every single one of those rules. And what I basically, what I, the way I perceived it, it was more reeducating people, the way I had to reeducate myself and that is to help people to begin to define, learn how to define themselves and, and begin to appreciate themselves and how, how to do that. I\u2122ve got a whole schema for doing that and, and I would come up with ideas but always in such a way that I would say look. I\u2122m just gonna share these with you. These are tools. It, everything is in your control. Everything is within your power so always leave you the power and leave in the control with, with my clients. And as a result, I could develop very equal relationships and people never saw me as telling what to do but it was a sharing which was super healing. It, it just, and it was amazing how quickly people, not everybody but an overwhelming majority were able to just begin to look at their life from a different perspective and learn different ways of dealing with it.

But if I tell somebody else what to do, the chance of \u201aem doing it are very small. It shouldn\u2122t, and so to that, and, but where I differ from classic counseling is th at I will come up with, I will say, I won\u2122t say a lot of counseling is how do you feel about this, how do you feel about this, how do you feel about this. I, like you feel about it is only marginally useful. I much more focus, okay, what are you gonna do about it. I\u2122m much more focused End of Tape 2.

That\u2122s critical b ecause otherwise you remain a victim of your past. But then you need to free yourself from your past as much as possible. Now, I won\u2122t ever be able to free myself completely and that\u2122s okay because I should never forget. But what I can do and what also my clients mostly need to do is they need to overcome the horrendous messages of their childhood. They need to take control over their lives and so I prefer focusing on the healing process instead of on the, just ________ on the past. "

I mean all the things, all the things Anita Frank 62 [Date not labeled] Page 62 that I think are important, thinking, problem -solving, analyzing and my job as the behavioral scient ist, I see as my major job is to, to teach our medical students to see patients at the partners, as their partners and not as diseases because medical school is heavily biological and so our, our physicians are trained to look at the disease process and at very little else. And so my major job is to keep the patient in mind, and to keep the patient as the focus and to deal with the patient as a partner and not just as the carrier of a disease. And it\u2122s very exciting and, and I\u2122m particularly interested i n the management treatment part of it where basically the patient should, we should have very different approaches. Physicians have a tendency to tell patients what to do, this is what you should, without explaining much, without looking at a patient\u2122s ci rcumstances to see whether in effect they can one, buy the medicine, take, take the medicine. Can they relax, can they adhere, do they understand what\u2122s going on? What are the pressures, what are the miseries, what are the situations at home?

But that\u2122s all they are. And one of the great tragedies is is that in the traditional approach, our physicians are taught, it becomes, because they tend to be obsessive compulsive, they tend to be perfectionists, they tend to be hard -driven and so on. What they want to do is they want to fix thi ngs. And they\u2122re happy when they can fix something. And when they can\u2122t fix something, they get very unhappy and very stressed and so what happens very often is that, particularly during the dying process when they can\u2122t do anymore for a patient, they abandon the patient. Because they can\u2122t do anymore. And so you see this avoidance behavior. That\u2122s because Anita Frank 64 [Date not labeled] Page 64 they\u2122re uncomfortable. They can\u2122t, they can\u2122t fix, the other focus for me is is that there is very little fixing you guys can do. If you\u2122re lucky you can cut out a, you can cure a bacterial illness with some antibiotics and you can cut out a cancer and you can do, you can do some other things that truly fix things. But most of the time, it isn\u2122t as simple as that. Most of the time you just have to learn to work with your patient to make it as, to make it better. But that means you need to be in partnership with your patient. And don\u2122t worry so much about fixing it."

We had a bottle of sherry. And smoking in the bedroom and putting the cigarette, his butts, his butts and his matches next to the bed. Anyway, Loren(ph) came home from school that Anita Frank 65 [Date not labeled] Page 65 first day and the house was covered in smoke. It was gray and he said, \ufb01Mommy, it stinks.\ufb02 He was three years old.

Well, I tell you, as far as he\u2122s concerned, cigarettes have always stunk. So he never smoked. But then when he went to high school, I talked to him about, I said, \ufb01Loren(ph), what do you think about al cohol and drugs? Do you think you\u2122re ever going to try those things?\ufb02 And his response to me was, \ufb01I don\u2122t know, how can I tell ya?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Well, what do you think right now? Do you think that you\u2122re, that, do you see yourself as experimenting with, w ith drugs?\ufb02 \ufb01Well, I might.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Well, Loren(ph), I just want you to know, it\u2122s gonna be your life that you\u2122re gonna louse up. I mean, it\u2122s gonna hurt me but it\u2122s gonna be your life, not my life.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01You\u2122ve got this magnificent brain, if you wanna destroy it, you wanna ruin it by getting into drugs, it\u2122s gonna be your problem.

And everything we had, my parents sold the furniture because that\u2122s to pay for the voyage so we just had I think, 16 or 17 suitcases and boxes with us, perhaps not that many, nine, I don\u2122t know how many. But that was all we had. And it was amazing, it was November and it was rough and all, what I remember most from that journey was just being so sick to my stomach and throwing up in the bathroom. And then when we got to New York, it was sort of amazing too, \u201acause we got to New York, and Henry Coster(ph) Anita Frank 70 [Date not labeled] Page 70 and his wife, Peggy, happened to be in New York for, for film, to watch, to watch films or plays or whatever it was. And they knew when we were, when, I guess they kn ew that, our arrival time. And, and, but we had no idea they would be there so we really had no idea what to do when we got to New York. So it was really interesting. We were waiting for all our luggage to get off the boat. There I saw this man looking and I\u2122d seen his picture and I went up to him and I said, \ufb01Are you Henry Coster(ph)?\ufb02 And he says, \ufb01Yes.\ufb02 And \u201acause he didn\u2122t recognize us and here we were, you think a family with four children. But I, I, and why, I just remembered him from his pictur e, so, which was, which turned out to be very nice. He\u2122d rented a big car and found us a cheap hotel. So we stayed a couple of days in New York and then took the bus to St. Louis. And then seven days later or four days later, I took the bus to Californi a.

So it was reall y hard getting used to the, to the fire engines and the ambulances, the police cars. That was the most distressing part. But it was sort of amazing to be in this huge city and I can remember we would buy food and eat in our hotel room. And my mother had some ancient aunts who lived in New York, we visited them. Tanta(ph), they were, as a matter of fact, they Anita Frank 71 [Date not labeled] Page 71 were my grandfather\u2122s sisters. Tanta Rebecca(ph), Tanta Rosa(ph).

I, she, this w as, we lived in, in this little town near Falkenburg __________, in Holland, Lindbergh(ph), and what we would do, the American soldiers, the white soldiers were, were sort of bivouacked in, in a hotel and then the blacks were right across the fields in ten ts. Anita Frank 72 [Date not labeled] Page 72 And we\u2122d go down and just sort of stand there, my mother had always told us not to ever ask for anything \u201acause that was impolite, so, American soldiers just adored us because there were cute little girls, eight, six, seven and eight. And they just looked there, at the, at these soldiers and so we always ended up with the most goodies. And I\u2122m not quite sure but my youngest sister, Helga, she\u2122d, she\u2122d come home, she just sort of told him to come with us, so, so, one day Bob Fenton(ph) came. One day she came home with a chaplain and said, \ufb01Mommy, that\u2122s the best I could find.\ufb02 Good taste. So, it was mostly that, it was safe, totally safe for us those days. And we just sort of, I\u2122m not quite sure in retrospect, that we just asked them to come hom e with us. And of course they would, they loved being in a home \u201acause these poor guys had been out in a field and so on so, it was fun and it was incredible to meet Jewish soldiers \u201acause that immediately formed a tie. I can remember, was another soldie r named Jimmy. Jimmy would knock us on our head and he also told us that the first one who learned Mary Had a Little Lamb would get ten cents. I won ten cents. And then, first one my father taught me, my first words in English were, he said, \ufb01If people ask you if you speak English, just answer, just, just a few words.\ufb02 So my, my first knowledge of English consisted of just a few words. And those were the only words I knew. But I learned English quickly. It\u2122s amazing how quickly we picked up."

And then I went to French, and then one day I took a political science course and sometimes you just hit your love and I just absolutely became enchanted with pol itical science and I was already a junior in college. And I was just fascinated by the Soviet Union. It was my first course with international relations course and I became fascinated by the Soviet Union. And I\u2122m trying to think why. I, I don\u2122t know why. In retrospect the, it was a country that was mysterious, they were, this was in the fifties, I went to college in \u212254 to \u212258. So that was the height of the Cold War. And I think it just grabbed my attention perhaps because of my experiences during the war as it was Nazi power, with the Nazi Germany as a great power, that perhaps, Anita Frank 75 [Date not labeled] Page 75 perhaps I felt that understanding the Soviet Union better might help me do something worthwhile or some, something like that. It was certainly not because I had any Communis t interest. It was truly because the Soviet Union represented danger I think and, and another great power and fascination. And then I, then I went to Harvard in the Russian Studies program and I was, and I was right because it was a wonderful choice because it\u2122s a, it\u2122s a, has an unbelievable history. Russian history is, is unbelievable history. And the Russian, and I spent a lot of time in the Soviet Union and the Russian people are remarkable people in many ways so it, it, intuitively I, I just picked the right country to be particularly interested in."

But yes, that we had those issues but the way it had been, it was so interesting, on the one hand they were told that they must overtake the United States. On the other hand they were told what a terrible country America was. Now it\u2122s pretty hard to overtake a country that is so terrible so there was some internal, were some internal contradictions. But anyway, this guy came and so he asked, he was very kind and he asked all these sort of questions about unemployment and yeah. I talked with him and then I happened to see him outside of the exhibit hall in, in, sort of on the stairs. And we started to talk and it turns out, he\u2122s told me he was Jewish. And I said, \ufb01Well, I\u2122m Jewish, too.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01You are?\ufb02 And it was just like this total change came, came over him and he said, \ufb01Is there really unemployment in America? Is there really any racism ?\ufb02 I mean, it\u2122s just like he\u2122s, talk the party line but then when it came to trusting me because he felt that he could, it was just like questioning everything. So that was sort of, yeah, and I s aid, \ufb01yes, we do,\ufb02 but, I, I tried to put in context of yes, there is racism but there\u2122s also something we\u2122re working on. Yes, there is unemployment but people are not just out in the streets starving to death, we have unemployment. I mean just Anita Frank 78 [Date not labeled] Page 78 trying to put an end to, and there\u2122s yes, there is poverty. I mean, we\u2122ve got all the problems but you look, anyway. And so that was, that was sort of a nice story and then another, one of the most touching stories was in, in, I think it was in Leningrad, it was in Leningrad again. The first one was in Moscow, the second one was in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg. Where a woman came and wanted a San Francisco phone book and, and I gave her the phone book and she looked up some addresses and, and then disappeared. Just before the exhibit closed, the same woman came back and her face was just beaming. She was absolutely, she said, \ufb01I found my sister.\ufb02 And she, her sister had left, also Jewish. The sister had left for the United States before the war and she hadn\u2122t heard from her in, that was, this was now \u212265, in 25 years. And she\u2122d found her sister\u2122s name in the phone book, had telegrammed her or called her and she sent, she showed me the telegram from her sister. I, I, she said, \ufb01Overjoyed at hearing from you. \ufb02 So it brought, and it, couple of times, some Russians, particularly Jews, found relatives that had gone to America because we had phone books from all over the country, so."

But I get over that very quickly. It is, but I , but I think that is so common to most of us women and to most people that I\u2122m not sure where that\u2122s a remnant of the war years Anita Frank 80 [Date not labeled] Page 80 or whether that is, that is a, whether, whether that is just part of being, most, few of us sort of like to be corrected or, or criticized or disapproved of so, I think, I still, there\u2122s part of me that still wants to please others even though intellectually I know that\u2122s not what I should be doing. But I know a large part of me is still is into, I mean little things. I will be talking to somebody and I won\u2122t ever be the first one to walk away. Just always being aware of who else is involved and including them, it\u2122s, somebody says you wanna do that, instead of saying no I can\u2122t, I will say I can, I\u2122ll try. It\u2122s that still, I st ill, part of me still tries to please more than I\u2122m comfortable with. I think that\u2122s part of the war. I, I still think that\u2122s part of the old me. But that\u2122s, that\u2122s about it. Those are not necessarily bad, bad things. No fears, driving sometimes, I wo rry about my husband\u2122s driving, and I\u2122m always but that\u2122s common. No, it\u2122s amazing, I really don\u2122t. My mother did but I don\u2122t. That\u2122s one of the great blessings of having been a child. I didn\u2122t integrate, at least I did not integrate the horror of the war, I really didn\u2122t. I, that\u2122s not fair. I, not the way I would have as an adult because I, as now, I\u2122m totally aware of what happened but as a child all I knew that I would be killed if they discovered if, which is a heavy thing for a child to live wi th. But I did not understand everything else that was going on. That was not until much later. So, thank God I didn\u2122t, I, it\u2122s beyond my understanding how concentration camp survivors can live with all their memories. It\u2122s, it\u2122s unbearable and for some it\u2122s so unbearable that, in effect, it\u2122s, I\u2122ve heard one of my friends who survived four concentration camps including, as a matter of fact he\u2122s a Schindler, he was on Schindler\u2122s list for a while.

            "question": "Okay. Let\u2122s see. I think that might be, oh, I, just I think this is it but I, I wanted to just ask you to talk about something we talked about before we started the tape and that was your, what you like about America being a self -examining society of sorts. Would you mind ending with that?",
            "answer": "Yeah. Well, I think that, that\u2122s really significant from my perspective and that is tha t one of the great blessings from my perspective about this country is, is that we\u2122ve made a lot of mistakes. You and I talked a little bit before we put the tape on, we talked a little bit about America\u2122s role during the war and the fact that the State Department had lots of anti -Semites in it and, and that this country knew, the government knew was happening to Jews and didn\u2122t do anything. That I think Roosevelt tried, there, absolutely no support for it, that the Jewish Underground begged the British a nd Americans who bombed the rail lines and the concentration camps and that, there were no bombs available or some excuses were given why Anita Frank 94 [Date not labeled] Page 94 that couldn\u2122t be done. And how many lives could have been saved if, if some relatively simple measures had been taken . And that then of course then America invited all these Nazis, these Nazi scientists, Gunter(ph), what is it, Gunter von Braun(ph), that was the guy, to come to America and, and to work on the weapons programs here. And we\u2122ve hidden, I mean, we still, w e\u2122re discovering Nazis left and right still. It\u2122s pretty late now. So I think this, and of course the, the horror of not letting the Jews and the, they, they, the ones who left Hamburg I think or Bramen(ph) on the, the ship, St. Louis and they were refus ed entry here and had to go back to an, to Germany or taken to the gas chamber. So, this country has no, has not an unblemished record, far from it in many ways. And that is I think, true in Europe. I, I, I think there isn\u2122t, Denmark perhaps, Denmark re ally had a small number of Jews and they, the king as a leader, behaved nobly and its population followed. They, as a country, get a lot of credit. And, and I, I expect the, I accept the fact that we all make mistakes but what I cannot accept is that we don\u2122t acknowledge our mistakes. I think one of the great blessings of this country is, is we, we allow, we encourage ourselves to examine our past and our policies and our history and we, there is a lot of self -criticism going on. And there is a lot of, we have a lot of controversy and we have a lot of people who have courage to examine the past and to look at the past and to say this is where we went wrong or this is where we didn\u2122t behave appropriately. And one of the things that has been so missing i n Europe has been that honest self -examination. And, and you even know it, you go to the museum in Paris, the war museum and the, the, the kind of sickening chauvinism of the French Anita Frank 95 [Date not labeled] Page 95 is just enough to, to appall anybody. And that is a, if you look at their museum, it\u2122s as if Charles de Gaulle(ph) won the war. There is absolutely nothing about French treachery. There\u2122s nothing about French cooperation with the Nazis. There\u2122s nothing about the police\u2122s happy cooperation, rounding of the Jews and betraying Jews, there is nothing of that in France. Only now are they coming to terms with it. In Holland also, Holland is better. It\u2122s now beginning to examine its past but it\u2122s taken them so long. For the longest time Holland had this, whenever I talked about Holland not having been so, such a glorious country during the war, people said surprised, \ufb01Oh, I thought they were so noble.\ufb02 Cause Holland fostered that. We the noble Dutch, we resisted the Nazis. Well they didn\u2122t. Some did. But no whole population can take credit for the enormous courage of a few and, and so, to me, one of the great poisonous, and, and I must admit I think that\u2122s where western Germany has, has done a relatively good job is they have a significant number of people who, who are aware of how vital it\u2122s been to examine their past. But overall, it\u2122s taken them a long time, too. And where in eastern Germany, this hasn\u2122t happened at all. And where you see these, these fascist movements rising. You see it in France, you see it in German y. It\u2122s, it\u2122s scary to me. And so, from my perspective that\u2122s something that we never must stop doing. We need to always reexamine our past. We need to learn from history and we need to be critical of ourselves and we need to learn and I applaud this country that, that looks at itself and says, you know what, that stank. That was no good. Many of us, it takes a long while to change, but this is, this is a country that we had McCarthy, that fascist in the fifties, Joseph McCarthy. Anita Frank 96 [Date not labeled] Page 96 Eventually, he was b rought down. Eventually, we had people of courage who, who brought him down even while this country was scared. And we need to make sure that we never give rise to other fascists like him who will happily destroy whole people because of this irrational f ear of, then it was Communism, infiltration of the Red Menace, and it\u2122s just, it\u2122s just dangerous. And so allowing dissent and allowing disagreement and examining ourselves all the time, I think is what\u2122s gonna keep this country on a reasonably healthy pa th."

            "answer": "Yeah, that\u2122s suc h a interesting question. To be honest, I see no infringement of my rights if there\u2122re gonna be tracers in these fertilizer things. That, as far as I\u2122m Anita Frank 97 [Date not labeled] Page 97 concerned, is only sensible. And to put taps on phones of suspected terrorists, that doesn\u2122t, we can exaggerate those potential dangers. And that\u2122s something that really bothers me. You can look at everything and, and make a huge case out of it and say what if, if, if, yes and as a result you can immobilize people to do absolutely nothing. And so I thi nk we need to be at all times careful that we, that we preserve our liberties but there\u2122s also something like the common good. And we must at all times weigh the common good against the protection of individual liberties. And I don\u2122t think it\u2122s just a on eway street. I, I have a firm commitment to the common good, also, and to my, in my opinion, and that\u2122s why with gun -control, I am so strongly for gun -control. I just, just that, this society is so violent and you see it, you see these 12 year old killi ng each other and killing others. It\u2122s just, it\u2122s insanity to, to scream about, from my perspective, about everybody\u2122s right to, to bear guns versus the, the community\u2122s rights to some, to a sense of safety. So again, a balance never, I see that generally is the answer to most of life\u2122s problems is to find a balance that takes into account both the common and individual rights."
