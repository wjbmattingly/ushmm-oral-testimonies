            "question": "So, | thought maybe we should start with some of those, just a couple things about the war that you didn't cover too much in the previous interview. You mentioned that there were a lot of times that you and your brothers, brother and sisters were almost caught. You told one or two stories but | wonder if there were some other moments that you remember coming close to being caught by the Nazis.",
            "answer": "Well the, the only ones that I\u2019m aware of were when they were going to interview us on the, on the train, when they were, they found the teacher with the Communist books and soon. That's the only time that I\u2019m aware of and I\u2019m not sure | mentioned then, I, |, as | said, I\u2019m not sure | remember this then but I, |, we just went back to Holland and for the first time we visited the house where we had been in hiding during the war in Biltoven(ph) and we had, had to move out of that house. And | can remember a couple of times, not in, when we were in that house but when we moved to | think the third house that we lived in, in Bilthoven(ph), that several times we were told to leave the house because there was, was gonna be a raid on the house and that we had to go into the back yard and go to neighbors and that we had to stay away, until, in effect, we were told to come back. So, clearly, there was a lot of suspicion that, that the family we stayed with, the Bookas(ph) were hiding children, but, and I'm not sure what they did with our clothes but there were other children there who were not Jewish so, that, they could easily have probably used our things to say those don't belong, those belong to the children who were clearly not Jewish. So, anyway, so several times that we had to, to disappear, to avoid the raids and that is, that is something | remembered only later as we visited the third house, actually, we went past it this past April. But, but what I\u2019ve done is I\u2019ve done  Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection  Anita Frank 2 [Date not labeled]  Page 2  some reading since | did that interview about my parents. My parents have, we asked them to put their memories on videotape, on audiotape. And they, |, | didn't realize how very often they came close to being taught, caught, that, that, at least four or five times the police were after them because, because my grandfather lived with them and, and his story was that he was from Switzerland but he didn\u2019t have his papers and other papers didn\u2019t come on time and then my father didn\u2019t have a job so any of those situations aroused the suspicion of the police. And at one point, actually, my mother, it was a guy named Pete, Pete who worked in Falkenburg where, where my parents were in hiding, came to visit them and, and, and interrogated them. And my mother basically said to him, \u201cPete, do not ask any more questions, because you don't want to know.\u201d And Pete, who was not a Nazi and not a traitor, said, \u201cOkay.\u201d So, it, it was times like that or, another time when in effect they were told that unless the papers came, were available they would be taken to, to police headquarters and they frantically tried to contact the man who had Mr. Frompinksteron(ph), who, who in effect had provided us with the false papers. And, and how my father, he couldn't telephone of course, from the town, he had to walk about ten or fifteen kilometers to a, to a place to make telephone calls so he wouldn't be traced. Situations like that, that |, we weren\u2019t aware of because we weren\u2019t with them but it, they happened many a time because my parents also lived out in the open like we did. That in a way they were continually exposed to danger and that's why they had the razor blades. They had their razor blades handy and miraculously we encountered, we encountered, they encountered police that were not with the,  Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Anita Frank 3 [Date not labeled] Page 3 with the NS Bay,(ph) which was the Dutch Nazi Party. At least four, five times, so, it was tenuous. And, and the reasons they had the raids, they didn't want to betray us. They did not. They hoped that if they were caught, at least that we children would be safe."

            "question": "And the Dutch, just before this interview when we were talking for a couple minutes, you mentioned that it was a small percentage of the Dutch who, who actually didn\u2019t betray Jews. Can you talk a little bit more about, | mean, obviously that\u2019s how you survived, right?",
            "answer": "Was because we were not betrayed. | need to stress, |, what, what my sense about Holland during the war was based on, based on history, basically, data and in retrospect, is that there was a small percentage perhaps five, five percent, if that many who actively tried to help Jews if, I\u2019m not sure there were that many, who were, who risked their own lives. And they were truly the noble, the very noble people, because it\u2019s hard to ask people to do that for others. So, about five percent perhaps that, I\u2019m not even sure it was, were that many, that actually, actively did something. My feeling is that 80 percent didn\u2019t care. I\u2019m not saying that they would have betrayed but also that they didn't care. But we had a significant, | would say fifty to twenty percent who were traitors. A huge percentage that were part of the, they belonged to the NS Bay(ph) which is the National Socialist Party, actively, who actively worked with the, with the Nazis, with the Germans and betrayed Jews. Most Dutch Jews probably were betrayed by Dutch rather than those were in hiding. | think they, they said something like 35,000 were in hiding, 15,000 were betrayed.  Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Anita Frank 4 [Date not labeled] Page 4 That\u2019s a significant number. Probably mostly by the Dutch. Dutch people who got a few dollars for it, a few guilders which the Dutch thing. They got guilders so each person had a, had a monetary value attached. And Holland only now is coming to terms with the fact that as a, as a people, they were not, they were not all that, | hate to say this, they were not all that different from the German people in that a lot of them just turned their heads. Most just turned their heads, let it happen."

She couldn't tolerate what was happening. From the very beginning, she couldn't tolerate this kind of injustice and absolutely, absolutely made it part of her, her life, her commitment to save as many as she could. And this was who she was. This was her, her mission in life and that\u2019s what | gather, was true for most of the rescuers. They saw something happening that was so intolerable to them that, that they could not live with themselves and let this, let this happen to others.

And | asked them if they knew we were Jewish and you know what? They  Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Anita Frank 6 [Date not labeled] Page 6 really didn\u2019t. They, it wasn't discussed, it was never discussed.

And, and the interesting thing about her is, she was so concerned about others that in some way, she neglected her own children. She had eight children, they had eight children themselves and, and that, you see that often in those who are truly committed to the well-being of others that, very often, there is some, you, you sort of assume your own children will manage.

And | didn\u2019t even know that she knew we were Jewish. | can remember, and that was, that was just the whole thing that | was so torn up about. | mean, we were told never to tell anybody, so as far as we were concerned, we were non-Jewish children living with these people and | had no idea who knew and who didn\u2019t know. So | couldn't tell anybody. So it was that, that horrendous fear of being discovered that stayed with me and the inability to talk to anybody about it, for two years.

They made money available to us and their two daughters survived the war. One is the, and one tragically killed herself after the war. Another, another consequence of the war.

One of the soldiers who had been in the Liberation Army in Lindbergh(ph), a wonderful young man, Jewish, and we had stayed in touch with him and he\u2019d gone back to America, married a journalist. And they wentto Paris. They, and they lived in Paris and invited one of us, and as the oldest girl | had privilege, to come and spend six weeks in Paris. And | remember, finally, my parents having little bit of extra money they could afford the train fare to, to Paris. It was a big adventure and it was the same summer they were able to rent a, a cabin on the beach. So | remember there was the one summer that we had a little bit of money.

My mother was, she had some help and my aunt, my mother\u2019s only sister, they had gotten her out of Germany in 1936 so she lived with us for awhile and my parents, and my mother\u2019s parents lived with us. So | think my mother\u2019s mother did much of the cooking until she died in 1938. But it was the Dutch eat potatoes and the, the staples really were bread and potatoes and a little bit of meat, porridge, food like that, vegetables. But meat was very  Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection  Anita Frank 14 [Date not labeled]  Page 14  expensive. Eggs were very expensive so you didn't have much of that so it was mostly the carbohydrates. And then during the war, | remember very clearly getting minute portions of butter, it was margarine, just like perhaps two tablespoons of butter, that, the margarine had to last us the whole week.

And | remember Betty taking me to the doctor every week. | just had sores all over my legs and | just didn't heal. And | think that had to do with, just deficiencies, vitamin deficiencies, more susceptible to illness. And then after the war, there were severe shortages again so really the whole time that | was in Holland until 52, things were rationed. | can remember seeing my first orange, getting it from the Americans, as first orange. Seeing my first pineapple in 1949 or so, in a store which was just sort of put there prominently and | not knowing what a pineapple was, so very simple foods after the war when, after things became, Holland was in horrendous shape because of the war.

What | do remember were feelings of | will never leave my parents, meaning | couldn't imagine that | would ever marry and want to leave my parents, that they represented my safety, my base, my  Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection  Anita Frank 16 [Date not labeled]  Page 16  solidity, my comfort. And that | had a very strong sense that, that, that they, that they represented all that was good for me. And, and | think that had to do with not having had them during the war, not being with them. | remember being, of course, horrendously ashamed and I\u2019ve talked about that, | think. [End of side 1 of tape 1]. Okay, so these, these, the feelings and that, that, so that involved fear and also it was because during the war, I, | had this real sense that | had to be perfect, that | couldn't make any mistakes, that | couldn't do anything wrong, | mean that was, as long as | just stayed perfect, that wouldn't, | wouldn't be killed. | mean, | wouldn't betray myself, or even more so, as long as | stayed perfect, nobody would betray me to the Germans, nobody would think | was a bad person and, and betray me to the Germans. And that sense of having to be this perfect child became part of who |, who I, | was after the war. And it meant that | couldn't assert myself. | was afraid of, | was afraid of asserting myself. And | remember having a feeling of, crazy, that | saw other children doing, doing bad, quote, bad things, not terribly bad but being disobedient or being rude and | can remember thinking, and | was about 11 years old. | can remember thinking, why can't | be like that? Why can't | be a little bit bad? So, so, clearly, there was, there remained an overriding fear in me that | had to be, | had to be good, | had to be perfect, otherwise something bad was going to happen to me.

And then, | remember one occasion. We were playing ball on the street. Tennis balls, we had tennis balls. And a woman  Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Anita Frank 17 [Date not labeled] Page 17 was riding her bicycle and she, she hit one of the balls and she fell and she was pregnant.

My mother was very felt, was very apologetic and paid for new stockings and stuff like that. And thank heavens the baby wasn't harmed. But, but | can remember that was my one moment of rudeness. But the way, the way this came out was, and | mentioned that, was that | became immobilized in school. | stopped learning. It was just like something in me got just so blocked is, the ability to be who | really was. And I\u2019m not saying I'm a a bad person or | wanted to be rude, but |, this, this sort of need to, to, to speak up for what you think or what you want didn\u2019t have, I, | just couldn't do that so that sort of came out then in school where | just became emotionally, just horrendously blocked. | couldn't, couldn't study, couldn't work and there, not being this perfect person, not being this top student which | always have been, I, I, that was just something | had no control over, | felt, so, I, | felt very bad about it because | knew | disappointed my father because he had such high expectations of me.

                " Well, you asked, you asked why, how, how was Hitler possible and, and | just, as | said we had answers to that, we'd know better. But! mean |, when | put in context is, is we have had two years, two thousand years, perhaps that's a little bit, no, really two thousand of unmitigated anti-Semitism in, in, in Europe, perhaps 1500. But, certainly, the Crusades, the, the Inquisition in Spain, | mean, blaming Jews for the plague. | mean it, all you have to do is go through European history and if you look at the Bible, this increasing anti-Semitism, this, this hatred of Jews. You see that developing in the Bible, it wasn't, that was not the original, the original disciples were not, they were Jews themselves. But you see, as, as Rome became Christian, they of course had to, to blame Jesus\u2019 death, not on the, the, the, the Romans but they had to blame it on the Jews. And you see this shift, this shift in the Bible itself to an increasingly more anti-Semitic perspective about Jews as Christ killers. And that became the great montra(ph) in, in European Christianity. Both Catholicism, Lutheranism is Jews the Christ killers, Jews the blood-suckers, the Jews the Damned, Jews are not gonna go to heaven, it\u2019s only the select Christians who somehow have got the one right answer who are gonna go, who are gonna go to heaven. And so you have the dominant religion which of course Christianity is, in, in Europe. You've got the dominant religion saying of another group of people that they're damned and they're gonna go to hell and they're, they suck the blood of Christian children. It becomes, they become the, the Jews, the dirty Jews, the ones, the dangerous people and then of course with the, with the Christians curtailing the  Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection  Anita Frank 33 [Date not labeled]  Page 33  Jewish, the Jewish, the possibility for Jews, jobs, professions and so on, were in a, in effect, Jews can only be, they could lend money because it was dirty for Christians to lend money. So they could do the dirty jobs. And then Jews become successful there, they're being killed because they did. They became the money lenders and you have Shakespeare and Merchant of Venice and Charlotan(ph), that perpetrating those horrors. And, and so you've got a whole culture of anti-Semitism which was, you have it in France with the Dryfuss(ph) Affair, | mean you have it all through Europe. In, in eastern Europe with the progroms, you have it all through Europe throughout with intermittent periods where in effect certain rulers(ph) who'd be tolerant of the Jews because they could use them. So it wasn\u2019t unmitigated, | mean it wasn't totally consistent but it certainly was consistent over time with periods of, of, of some, of some allowance to, to let Jews live their lives and flourish. And | must say that\u2019s where Holland has had us, on the whole, a, a better history, not perfect but certainly a better history of tolerance for Jews because they did allow the Sofottic(ph) Jews with the Inquisition to come to Holland and Holland has had a relatively, extraodinarily wonderful history of, of religious freedom. And has allowed its Jews to live in relative peace. But in Germany, Germany with all of its, its effort that becoming a nation-state which it didn\u2019t become until Bismarck with all of its in-fighting and then, and, and a population which is the same as in Holland, this, this, a population that has as its dogma the Christian belief that if you just, the Calvinistic belief if, if you just do everything right and you follow God's word and you do it, then good things are gonna come to you. And that basically, you obey. It\u2019s very  Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection  Anita Frank 34 [Date not labeled]  Page 34  important to do what you're told, not to question this sort of authoritarian, sort of ethic of, of, of children must listen to their parents, children must obey, children must not question. Father knows best. So you've got this, this sort of a cultural pattern of not questioning what goes on, a religious pattern of, if something bad happens to people, they deserve it. And then a historical pattern of extreme anti-Semitism, then you ve got this great combination that when things go bad, as of course Hitler came to power after this horrendous inflation, well, first the defeat for Germany in World War | which was a horrendous blow to their morale and then, this, this terrible inflation that impoverished millions of people. What you do is you find a scapegoat. And Hitler, Hitler was always a rabid anti-Semite. But people become very vulnerable to, becoming comfortable to, yes, it\u2019s all the Jews\u2019 fault. Blame somebody else, | mean we do it in this country all the time, is blaming somebody else. Blame the immigrants. Blame, blame the illegal aliens. Blame everybody. Even blame outside terrorists when we're breeding our own terrorists. We have the militia who Is SO dangerous here. So you blame, you start blaming others. And then everybody else is doing it and it becomes really comfortable and then you obey orders and you don't question and you become self-satisfied and smug because things are getting better. It\u2019s not, not difficult then to understand the Jews, the traditional scapegoat in Europe became an obvious scapegoat here. And then with German propaganda, they did an unbelievable job of painting Jews as rats. As vermin. Destroying the fiber of the great Aryan nation. And that propaganda is, is staggering, you see some of those propaganda films. So you put all that together, it\u2019s  Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Anita Frank 35 [Date not labeled] Page 35 not surprising. It\u2019s not difficult to make people hate others. And that\u2019s why for me, questioning, always questioning, never accepting what people tell you without really examining the validity of any of it and never allowing others to dictate your moral stands. It\u2019s just so vital. "

Don't talk about it, don\u2019t deal with it but for heaven\u2019s sakes, and | think that has been a hallmark for at least our family, is prove that the Germans, that the Nazis were wrong, prove that you're okay.

But in that effort to accomplish, they, the children, except for the youngest, the two older girls had to fend for, had to fend for themselves a great deal and were to some extent neglected. And not because they wanted to do that but because they, they had, they felt they had to work so hard to, to make it in this country. And they did make in this country.

But | Know, because of my background, that tremendous harm was done and that, there was enormous pain and my, the oldest one, Betty, who is, who, who was born during the war, | mean she knows it, she\u2019s done a lot of talking about it and, and she is aware of, of, she\u2019s aware of the horrendous pain.

            "answer": "Hard work. Hard work. It\u2019s, it's, as | work with people, that\u2019s what | really try and teach them is how do you do that and, and, for me, the, the single most important clue is that when | was so unsafe and felt so defeated, | let the whole world define me. Itwas Anita who had to be this perfect, obedient, good, accepting, non-creative basically, because if | did anything creative, my goodness, it might annoy people so this trapped in a, in a box person who tried to please everybody and tried to avoid making anybody mad so that at least | would get positive input from others. | mean going back to Elizabeth Dixon is, she, | had to translate that at least she values me.  Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Anita Frank 56 [Date not labeled] Page 56 Well, if she values me, there must be some value to me \u2018cause | didn\u2019t feel it. So it is stopping that, it\u2019s stopping looking to others to make you feel safe and begin to really get to Know yourself and define yourself. It\u2019s at self-definition. It's knowing who you are. Its Knowing your strengths, knowing your weaknesses. It is when people are mad at you, it's not to say oh my gosh, I'm a bad person but to say, oh, you're mad atme. Well, who's problem is it? Is it your problem, is it really something I've done? If it\u2019s something I\u2019ve done, that\u2019s something | can learn from. What do | need to, | need to work on changing that so it\u2019s not closing myself off from others, it\u2019s remaining open to the input that others give me but at a very, on a very limited basis. Because | recognize that everybody else is probably crazier than | am and to let other people define me, hah! What a joke that is. | mean we, the Nazis defined us as dirty, filthy Jews worthy of extermination. No one will ever define me again. So it\u2019s partly again, it\u2019s a reaction to that. Nobody will define me. | will define myself. But within the context of my environment so to avoid becoming this extreme narcissist, you, you want to remain open to input but you want to weigh it against what you know about yourself. That\u2019s, and this way you keep on growing and the, and the most wonderful thing is the more at peace you are with yourself, the nicer you can be to other people. You don't, cause you don't have to destroy others to feel good about yourself. Asa matter of fact, it hurts you to be negative or destructive to others and so you know that those who are destructive, there\u2019s something wrong with them. Because if you truly feel good about yourself, you don\u2019t, you don\u2019t want to hurt others, cause it hurts you if you are.  https://collections.ushmm.org  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Anita Frank of [Date not labeled] Page 57"

What they want to do is they want to fix things. And they're happy when they can fix something. And when they can't fix something, they get very unhappy and very stressed and so what happens very often is that, particularly during the dying process when they can\u2019t do anymore for a patient, they abandon the patient.

That's because  Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Anita Frank 64 [Date not labeled] Page 64 they're uncomfortable. They can't, they can't fix, the other focus for me is is that there is very little fixing you guys can do. _ If you\u2019re lucky you can cut out a, you can cure a bacterial illness with some antibiotics and you can cut out a cancer and you can do, you can do some other things that truly fix things.

            "question": "Okay. Let\u2019s see. | think that might be, oh, |, just | think this is it but |, | wanted to just ask you to talk about something we talked about before we started the tape and that was your, what you like about America being a self-examining society of sorts. Would you mind ending with that?",
            "answer": "Yeah. Well, | think that, that\u2019s really significant from my perspective and that is that one of the great blessings from my perspective about this country is, is that we\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes. You and | talked a little bit before we put the tape on, we talked a little bit about America\u2019s role during the war and the fact that the State Department had lots of anti-Semites in it and, and that this country knew, the government knew was happening to Jews and didn't do anything. That | think Roosevelt tried, there, absolutely no support for it, that the Jewish Underground begged the British and Americans who bombed the rail lines and the concentration camps and that, there were no bombs available or some excuses were given why  Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection  Anita Frank 94 [Date not labeled]  Page 94  that couldn't be done. And how many lives could have been saved if, if some relatively simple measures had been taken. And that then of course then America invited all these Nazis, these Nazi scientists, Gunter(ph), what is it, Gunter von Braun(ph), that was the guy, to come to America and, and to work on the weapons programs here. And we've hidden, | mean, we still, we\u2019re discovering Nazis left and right still. It\u2019s pretty late now. So | think this, and of course the, the horror of not letting the Jews and the, they, they, the ones who left Hamburg | think or Bramen(ph) on the, the ship, St. Louis and they were refused entry here and had to go back to an, to Germany or taken to the gas chamber. So, this country has no, has not an unblemished record, far from it in many ways. And that is | think, true in Europe. |, |, | think there isn\u2019t, Denmark perhaps, Denmark really had a small number of Jews and they, the king as a leader, behaved nobly and its population followed. They, as a country, get a lot of credit. And, and I, | expect the, | accept the fact that we all make mistakes but what! cannot accept is that we don't acknowledge our mistakes. | think one of the great blessings of this country is, is we, we allow, we encourage ourselves to examine our past and our policies and our history and we, there is a lot of self-criticism going on. And there is a lot of, we have a lot of controversy and we have a lot of people who have courage to examine the past and to look at the past and to say this is where we went wrong or this is where we didnt behave appropriately. And one of the things that has been so missing in Europe has been that honest self-examination. And, and you even know it, you go to the museum in Paris, the war museum and the, the, the kind of sickening chauvinism of the French  Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection  Anita Frank 95 [Date not labeled]  Page 95  is just enough to, to appall anybody. And that is a, if you look at their museum, it\u2019s as if Charles de Gaulle(ph) won the war. There is absolutely nothing about French treachery. There's nothing about French cooperation with the Nazis. There's nothing about the police\u2019s happy cooperation, rounding of the Jews and betraying Jews, there is nothing of that in France. Only now are they coming to terms with it. In Holland also, Holland is better. It's now beginning to examine its past but it\u2019s taken them so long. For the longest time Holland had this, whenever | talked about Holland not having been so, such a glorious country during the war, people said surprised, \u201cOh, | thought they were so noble.\u201d Cause Holland fostered that. We the noble Dutch, we resisted the Nazis. Well they didn\u2019t. Some did. Butno whole population can take credit for the enormous courage of a few and, and so, to me, one of the great poisonous, and, and | must admit | think that\u2019s where western Germany has, has done a relatively good job is they have a significant number of people who, who are aware of how vital it's been to examine their past. But overall, it\u2019s taken them a long time, too. And where in eastern Germany, this hasn't happened at all. And where you see these, these fascist movements rising. You see it in France, you see it in Germany. It\u2019s, it's scary to me. And so, from my perspective that\u2019s something that we never must stop doing. We need to always reexamine our past. We need to learn from history and we need to be critical of ourselves and we need to learn and | applaud this country that, that looks at itself and says, you know what, that stank. That was no good. Many of us, it takes along while to change, but this is, this is a country that we had McCarthy, that fascist in the fifties, Joseph McCarthy.  Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Anita Frank 96 [Date not labeled] Page 96 Eventually, he was brought down. Eventually, we had people of courage who, who brought him down even while this country was scared. And we need to make sure that we never give rise to other fascists like him who will happily destroy whole people because of this irrational fear of, then it was Communism, infiltration of the Red Menace, and it\u2019s just, it's just dangerous. And so allowing dissent and allowing disagreement and examining ourselves all the time, | think is what\u2019s gonna keep this country on a reasonably healthy path."

And to put taps on phones of suspected terrorists, that doesn't, we can exaggerate those potential dangers. And that's something that really bothers me. You can look at everything and, and make a huge case out of it and say what ff, if, if, yes and as a result you can immobilize people to do absolutely nothing. And so | think we need to be at all times careful that we, that we preserve our liberties but there\u2019s also something like the common good.

It\u2019s just, it's insanity to, to scream about, from my perspective, about everybody\u2019s right to, to bear guns versus the, the community\u2019s rights to some, to a sense of safety. So again, a balance never, | see that generally is the answer to most of life\u2019s problems is to find a balance that takes into account both the common and individual rights."
