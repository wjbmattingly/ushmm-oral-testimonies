He was by streetcar like a half an hour away in a smaller town there and I knew he\u2122s cousins. So I\u2122d mentioned once to his cousin\u0160that was during the war. I was 14-15 years old, a teenager, and/that she Tape 21 HELEN LUKSENBURG page 38 should introduce me and she never did. So one guy who worked in our factory went to work where he was working. So I said to Joe I said, Bring him over. One day he comes with him and he brings him to my machine and my cousin was sitting across like you are sitting and she said \u0160and he/we started to giggle. We were girls and we started to giggle. He remembers two young girls giggling. That\u2122s all what he remembers. He\u2013mind wasn\u2122t clear at that time. He just lost his parents and he was homeless. He had to gi ve up his own room and people moved in because he was a single person. He wasn\u2122t entitled to a room and [EXHALES] so that was the end. I come to the camp and who do I see through the fence he is in that camp but I didn\u2122t approach him or anything. Once w e\u2013didn\u2122t have water in our bathroom so it was a backdoor from the men\u2122s\u0160 We were divided by fence. The mens [men] was a thousand men and 600 women. They were building the factories and we were working in them. As soon as one was finished, we operated it. We didn\u2122t have any water so it was a back door from the men\u2122s wash ?____ that we could go and fetch some water. I go in and he\u2122s there standing and washing his pants, and a friend of his was there, introduced us. That\u2122s all. And he was\u2013sleep on his pants because it was important that the\u2013stripes have a\u2013crease in them and never took off that little cap. He was ashamed because that head, hair was shaven. A couple days later our barrack was the first barrack by the fence. Somebody comes to the barrack and says, Somebody wants to talk to you by the fence. I go out. Here\u2122s that and started to talk with me, nothing could go on. And from that time on he used to come to the fence and we\u2122d talked. And one day I was by the fence talking to him and I didn\u2122t notice that was a German officer up the hill watching us. He came around into the barrack and the German came in. And he said, I counted five people by the fence. If these five people don\u2122t come up every other fifth person will have their hair shaven. There were women 30 years old. I was at Tape 21 HELEN LUKSENBURG page 39 the time 17 years old who never spoke to a man and I\u2013always felt very responsible person and I came forward. Why should people who never even were there and never talked to a man be punished because I had a rendezvous. S o I came forward because I was such a brave Jew. He took me by the neck, rouse, and pushed me out. Nobody else came/followed me so I run into the next room and cry, wanted to go back. Why should innocent people be punished for my foolishness? She didn\u2122t le t me. She was sleeping after nightshift there and she said, You admitted it. Why should you go back? The next morning the comradeship was so great that not the men were watching us who to tell whose head/hair was shaved. They couldn\u2122t tell. We had littl e triangles, black triangles, purposely to put on like a turban that because the soot, the black stuff, doesn\u2122t get into our hair when we were working. So everybody took the\u2013people who had their head shaven made a little lock outside and everybody was wearing a turban that you couldn\u2122t tell who\u2013head was shaven or\u2013who was. The comradeship, we were each other\u2122s and still remain like related like family because we were thrown together. Everybody was in the same situation, everybody lost everybody, [EMOTIONAL] the whole family, so it was very important the comradeship to us."

When I was in ?_Ravensburg a transport from \u0160we were on the same trains, a transport from Auschwitz and one girl recognize me who knew my parents and told me she went them at the liquidation of the ghetto to Auschwitz and she saw my father going to the ovens. So I knew, had proof. My brother, I thought, maybe he will survive. That\u2122s why I went back to Poland. I was liberated by the Russians and the Russians were tending your home \u0160?_Polotsckdomo, Polish people\u0160and they were dismantling everything in Germany. They were taking apart and sending to Russia all the machinery and we didn\u2122t have any transportation at all, how to get. So when I was recuperating after the war [NOISE] in a villa from typhoid with another girl, I stood by the window\u2013and two Russian\u2013soldiers came by and I ver y innocently just mentioning \ufb01 oy-vey\ufb02 he look to me like maybe he\u2122s Jewish.

After the war he found out that they took that whole transport in ?_Schweinbach I think\u2013and put in a barn, poured gasoline, and burned everybody alive.
