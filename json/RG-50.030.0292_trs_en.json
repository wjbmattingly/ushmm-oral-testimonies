My family still stayed on in RokiSkis and \u2014 but I was sent to Kovno and that time, at the age of 12 or 13, I was sent to my grandparents who used to live in Kovno.

And the fact that the school they put me in was also a gymnasium, which was about five minutes walking distance from \u2014 from where they used to live. And of course, I started going to the \u2014 to the school. The \u2014 the \u2014 the schooling system was extremely well and this \u2014 this was the reason also they send me to Kovno, because in the small cities they didn't have Hebrew gymnasiums and this was a Hebrew gymnasium.

And by having the opera around us and especially myself and also many of our friends were very much involved in the opera. Of course, we didn't have the money and the resources to \u2014 to \u2014to go and sometimes to the opera, but we always find a way to participate and to enjoy the cultural life and especially the opera, the ballet. And it was a beautiful, beautiful opera. And this was also was in a compound of a \u2014 within a park, a city park. I also remember that I used to read quite a lot. And there was, of course, radio, all what we had. And it was in the early stages. We didn't have, of course, TV or some other entertainment. So mostly our activities were basically around the community, around the synagogue, which was not too far also from us. Kovno was a city of about I would say hundred and \u2014 hun \u2014 hundred \u2014 over 100,000 people \u2014 out of about I would say maybe 150,000 people.

We had a university, not \u2014 not too big, and that was very difficult to get into the university.

And they suddenly, middle of the night, they run out, without saying anything. They disappeared. And a little while later we heard bombings, we heard planes. And we put on the radio, and this was the invasion of the second \u2014 actually the \u2014 the Nazi part of the second World War started. Whereby that Hitler didn\u2019t announce, without announcing, he just \u2014 he starts \u2014 start the invasion. And he actually deceived anybody, because there were no massed troops on the borders that time. He just tried to get this war started, and \u2014 and \u2014 and started war by surprise. And it was really a surprise, because no \u2014 nobody \u2014 nobody was \u2014 was ready for that. Everybody was living with the dreams that they had this Ribbentrop pact, it was Molotov, and \u2014 and that both parts were satisfied that there is no \u2014 we \u2014 we leaned more to the fact that we thought that he is going to \u2014 if he 1s going to attack, he is going to go against England, rather than \u2014 than \u2014 it was a \u2014 a incredible surprise.

And this was so dramatic, and we \u2014 we \u2014 we didn\u2019t know. We had some relatives on the \u2014 we had a \u2014 that was called a \u2014 the klininbar(ph), that\u2019s the \u2014 the green \u2014 the Green Mountain. That was a \u2014 a place within \u2014 within Kovno where we had some relatives who \u2014 who \u2014 from my aunt\u2019s part, who lived there. We felt maybe to go to them, there in that place maybe would be safer. So we went up there, and then we came back to our \u2014 to our apartment, feel the safest place is to stay in the apartment. Killings started, and especially Lithuanians, where they were very bo \u2014 very much against \u2014 against the Soviets. They hated the Soviets, you know, from the beginning. So \u2014 and they considered that there are some Jewish people were in the communists, and \u2014 and they \u2014 right away they wanted to take vengeance, you know, and what they did is, they right away start killing people, start torturing them, start \u2014 there was a s \u2014 a special \u2014 a special torture chamber, which was made to a \u2014 to a torture chamber, which was made in a \u2014 one of their gas stations. They brought in about 20 people, and they put hoses in their mouth, and they \u2014 and they start water pressuring. And they just killed them with the \u2014 with that. I mean, there were so \u2014 such atrocity that beyond \u2014 beyond description. And the Germans were not in yet. The ger \u2014 Germans were still \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 you see,  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  25 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 the Germans, they had their tactics of the surrounding in a ring, and then closing up in the ring, an-and \u2014 and coming to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the focal point where they were going to occupy. The \u2014 for the Russians it was a incredible shock what happened, and they \u2014 they were really not prepared and not ready for the oncoming victorious German troops. There were also announcements in the radio two days later, where it said that \u2014 it was in Lithuanian, in Russian, and in German, what said that \u2014 but basically highlighting in Lithuanian. The victorious German troops are coming, are close to Kovno, they are going to enter Kovno in \u2014 in the next hours, and we have noticed that some snipers, and some communists, and some Jews have \u2014 are resisting, and shooting against them. So we want to mention that for each German soldier that is going to be killed \u2014 that\u2019s going to be killed \u2014 hundred Jews or communists are going to be taken and shot, without \u2014 without any \u2014 any question. And this was constantly, and \u2014 and constantly in the radio. So we \u2014 we felt already, we knew what \u2014 what \u2014 what\u2019s coming and \u2014 and we didn\u2019t realize that we felt, maybe after Kovno is going to be taken over by the Germans, maybe they are going to establish their \u2014 their rules, and they are going to be more human than \u2014 than the Lithuanians, but this was not the case, and they occupied Kovno. Then suddenly, every day they used to make \u2014 promulgate a \u2014 a new decree. One decree, the first one was that all Jews have to bring into the kommandantur any arms, if they had  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick \u201c\u00b0 September 22, 1994 any \u2014 any \u2014 any radios. Any watches. Anything, right away. Then there came a second decree, that the Jews cannot walk on the sidewalk, they have to walk on the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the street side. Third decree was that you have to give up all your \u2014 all \u2014 all the valuables. If you have some jewelry, some \u2014 some \u2014 any kind, any type of jewelry, stamps \u2014 I had a big collection of stamps, myself.

And everybody was some kind, you know, just came into the ghetto, and \u2014 and we were short on food, and then they also promised that they are going to be rewarded, very much re \u2014 very properly rewarded with \u2014 with food that \u2014 nobody \u2014 nobody spoke about money. Money was irrelevant at that time. The \u2014 the basic thing was food, food and food, you know. So everybody was rushing. My uncle \u2014 my aunt\u2019s  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  30 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 brother told me that he would like to \u2014 he would like to go, and he had just to \u2014 he was in process of shaving or something, that I should wait for him few minutes. I was not too familiar with the ghetto yet, because it was split up in such a way, and I was never that \u2014 in that section of the city, maybe once or twice in my lifetime, because I had also a \u2014 a football place, where my Maccabi(ph) used to play there, in Slobodka, and my uncle \u2014 one of my uncles was a very, very good football player, so I\u2014 sometimes, you know, I was \u2014 but this was a new situation. So, I didn\u2019t know, and we were a little bit nervous, in the sense we wanted to be there on time. We didn\u2019t have \u2014 we didn\u2019t have watches, you know, we had to look at the sun, and to approximately make sure that we\u2019re in the right time. We \u2014 we start going, looking for a \u2014 for a place where they \u2014 where we were supposed to get, and we got there like 10 minutes late. There were already 506 people, were already up this \u2014 fulfill this assignment, this projected amount of people, and the \u2014 the Germans were satisfied, and you know, Germans are very meticulous and punctual. And they said, we have already the amount, and you go back, we don\u2019t need you any more. So we were a little disappointed, you know, we came back. In meantime, what happened within the \u2014 in the time that the Jews start moving to the ghetto, they were marry \u2014 many atrocities committed by Lithuanians. I mean, they were \u2014 they were \u2014 they were \u2014 just became so barbaric, and without any \u2014 any \u2014 any reason,  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick \u00bb September 22, 1994 you know. They \u2014 they start killing, raping, an-and taking away all kind of \u2014 all kind of items that belonged to \u2014 to the Jewish people, you know, when they \u2014 when \u2014 every time we moved, when we moved to the \u2014 to the Green Mountain, we were going to my aunt\u2019s brother\u2019s house. He had there a little farm, and we felt we\u2019re going to go over there, and we\u2019re going to be able to have some food, because he had \u2014 the farm still belonged to him. So, when we went there, there were \u2014 nighttime came in, and a group of like three or four people with their guns, and they started taking away everything, whatever we \u2014 and \u2014 and my uncle stood up for them, so they hit him with their \u2014 with their \u2014 with their rifle butt, you know."

They \u2014 they were in, but they mind their own business, and they let Lithuanians to enjoy themselves, doing what they did. And it was \u2014 was terrible things they have done. They have taken people to their \u2014 to their \u2014 to \u2014 to a prison. And there was also a teacher of my \u2014 I remember [indecipherable] Goldman(ph), a familiar name. He  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  32 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 was our English teacher. He was himself from South Africa. And he was a compulsive smoker, so the \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t give him any \u2014 anything to smoke, so he used to get the small ration of \u2014 of bread, he used to exchange that for \u2014 for cigarettes. And he finally succumbed, he died, you know, because he \u2014 he just \u2014 his body wouldn\u2019t \u2014 wouldn\u2019t resist it. But beside the beatings, and the \u2014 and the \u2014 and the \u2014 the \u2014 the terror that they \u2014 they have implanted him in was \u2014 it was just terrible.

So one \u2014 1n a certain way, when we came into the ghetto, we felt a little bit safer in our surrounding. We knew that \u2014 that there are going to be \u2014 we \u2014 we predicted, we anticipated some atrocities, but \u2014 but at least they were going to be in a\u2014 in a\u2014 1n a\u2014 1n a certain \u2014 in a certain \u2014 done in a certain way.

And these were people that \u2014 that they s \u2014 not only they run to the highway, but people who were just systematically taken out from their houses. They went with their list, apparently they had a list of \u2014 of addresses, would take them out and then just \u2014 not \u2014 it \u2014 it wa \u2014 shooting was not th-the \u2014 the great part, but \u2014 but to torture, all kind of ways of torturing, you know, like chopping off a arm, a-and especially also with children. That was terrible, and all, but what they have done with \u2014 with children, like smashing them against the wall, or \u2014 and most of the time they were drunk, you know. Because for one thing is the Lithuanians knew \u2014 I mean, they were very educated in \u2014 in drinking. They used to made \u2014 make a lot of homemake \u2014 homemade vodka. It was called samagonda(ph), it was made from potatoes. And this was, like in the times of prohibition, you know, th-this \u2014 this was \u2014 you know, due to the fact of the climate, that we have a cold climate, there are very many, many drunks on the \u2014 on the streets. There were always many drunks, and \u2014 and \u2014 and this drinking didn\u2019t help the situation in the beginning, because they had that available, they \u2014 they took over some places where there were all kinds of \u2014 of liquor, an-and \u2014 and wine, and \u2014 and they \u2014 they would empty this out, and th \u2014 th- this \u2014 this was also something that they had in common with the Russians, who  http://collections.ushmm.org  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Abe Resnick \u201d September 22, 1994 were also very good in that, you know, in drinking.

There were some \u2014 some cases of resistance. There was a case of a schoolmate of mine, his name was Discant(ph), that he dressed himself as a \u2014 as a German officer, and \u2014 [interruption, break] He \u2014 he \u2014 there were formed, small groups of resistance, really in \u2014 were in the forming. They were a little older than myself, they were a little more mature. Those who \u2014 who started \u2014 who started organizing. And there was a friend of mine, already a friend that we used to \u2014 he used to come to my house, and we used to \u2014 to not only go to school together, but to have some and certain things in common, you know. So he \u2014 he was dressed as a \u2014 dressed a German officer, and they \u2014 they were supposed to escape to the forest, you know, to pro at \u2014 I mean, to institute their resistance. And apparently the guy,  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick \u201d September 22, 1994 the chauffeur that\u2019s supposed to take them, betrayed them. And then \u2014 and that was already not the Lithuanians, but the Germans caught them, and they took them to the Gestapo and they shot them, all of the, you know, there were like 14 people and one of \u2014 he was one of those. So there were start \u2014 and the question is, why didn\u2019t you have resistance. Because the Russian army that was there, and they had their \u2014 their \u2014 their arms, and they were not resisting, because they saw the handwriting on the wall, they saw what actually happened, they saw the might. And when the \u2014 I remember the day the Germans came in, and I looked through the window. My uncle used to pull me back, I shouldn\u2019t look through the window, because an-any moment, I mean, somebody can shot \u2014 shoot you, you know. Tha \u2014 when they came in, and they \u2014 and they paraded in the street, they came in clean, with their boots shining, you could \u2014 like mirrors, you know, and with loudspeakers. Ahead of them were Lithuanians who were pronouncing that the victorious German army is coming in, that they \u2014 this is only a \u2014 are going to be established here. But the army is going to move on, and \u2014 and finish with the \u2014 with the \u2014 with the Soviets, and it\u2019s a matter only of a short time. They expect to do that within the summer. That was \u2014 that was June. So they figured, June, July, August, September, October gets ready. So they \u2014 they thought their \u2014 they were projecting to occupy the Soviet Union about four or four months, you know, which they \u2014 Napoleon was not able to do  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick \" September 22, 1994 that also, you know. He had the same \u2014 the same pattern. But resisting, I \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it was \u2014 everybody was on the shock, you know. And \u2014 and normally, we people were not ready for \u2014 for resisting. We have never had an-anything, any training in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in arms. When I know that later on, I\u2019m going to tell you that \u2014 which I hi \u2014 will tell you now, that I used to, in many cases I used to take off my \u2014 my stars, and \u2014 and then used to go out and I was blondish, I didn\u2019t look too much as \u2014 well, non- Jewish, and I used to go out and \u2014 and trade certain things in order to get \u2014 to get some food, because their f \u2014 the food situation became very critical, very critical. As soon they took us into the ghetto, they \u2014 they started in \u2014 they started taking brigades, they were called brigades. When a brigadier creates \u2014 they instituted a \u2014a police, a Jewish police was in the ghetto, and then they instituted also the \u2014 a Jewish council. So, first of all they were \u2014 had to repair to fix the airports. So everybody was compelled to go out in the morning, five o\u2019clock in the morning had to be in the reunion place, and then they used to come and \u2014 with guards, and \u2014 and walk to the \u2014 to the airport. So I remember they used to give us 200 grams of bread, and I used to put it in the pocket, an-and by the time I came to the \u2014 to the airport, and when they used to give us some soup, which was made of water, and well, with some \u2014 some vegetables, some kind of this [indecipherable] vegetables, you know. And they used to boil that, and by that time I didn\u2019t have really bread, because walking, I  http://collections.ushmm.org  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Abe Resnick \" September 22, 1994 \u2014I used to chew off on the portion of bread. So the situation of \u2014 the food situation became very \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the duration was very, very bigger. And we \u2014 we had to trade sometimes, certain objects with the \u2014 with Lithuanians. So, in the beginning, they used to let the \u2014 we were able to do that, but there were some \u2014 some people who didn\u2019t have a heart, from the Lithuanian side, you know. For instance, used to trade a\u2014 a-\u2014a suit for a\u2014 for a kilo of butter. So after you \u2014 you have to do that fast, you know, because they \u2014 you had to do that when the guard was with his back to \u2014 to you, you know. So, in the desperation you found out sometimes that instead of butter, what you had is a big stone, on that \u2014 I mean, with \u2014 with a\u2014 with a little bit \u2014 with a little bit of butter on \u2014 on the sides, you know. And it was disaster, and you \u2014 you were unable to do anything, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 those people who were free had all the rights.

They \u2014 although they didn\u2019t tattoo us with \u2014 with \u2014 on the beginning [indecipherable] afterwards in \u2014 when they took to the concentration camp. So life was \u2014 was terrible, especially in the beginning, it \u2014 it-it was very hard to \u2014 to get the \u2014 get used to and accommodate it, but \u2014 but there was no \u2014 no choice.

And you \u2014 you call \u2014 you do your work, and you come back after a day\u2019s work, whereby you have guards there, and they constantly changed. In the beginning they had the  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 46 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 German guards, but then they start to bringing in the \u2014 the [indecipherable] the Russian Ukrainians, and then brought in Hungarians. And believe me, these guards, they were incompassionate. They used to beat you up every time you \u2014 you \u2014 you had to \u2014 to work, I mean without \u2014 almost without food, but constantly, and under supervision, and within the cold weather, they \u2014 they used to put a\u2014 a some a\u2014a side fire in our work. From time to time you would come and \u2014 and warm up your hands, you know, you had the mittens, or the \u2014 but that do \u2014 didn\u2019t mean anything now, because if your body doesn\u2019t have fuel, I mean, you \u2014 you are \u2014 you still cold \u2014 it gets colder than in normal, when you have food. And they used to have special \u2014 special woods \u2014 wood sticks, which they would beat you up, you know, ev-every time, and without \u2014 without mercy. And every time you used to go to warm up, you stayed a little bit longer than what you supposed to, you know, which was prohibited to do that in the beginning, but you would do it \u2014 come out, because when the \u2014 and so my uncle was \u2014 he was a sick man, you know, he \u2014 so I used to work for him, I \u2014 sh \u2014 because there were a few shifts, there was like a 24 hour day, around the clock, to work at the airport, because they want to re-re-reestablish the airport, and \u2014 in order to be able to use that for their \u2014 for their own \u2014 for their own use, for their \u2014 and life was \u2014 was terrible. Of course, it \u2014 it gradually was in \u2014 in changing. In the beginning it was a ghetto. Then after \u2014 after a while it became a  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick \" September 22, 1994 concentration camp, and we have received the \u2014 before we were under the Wehrmacht, under the military. Then we \u2014 we came under the jurisdiction of the Obersturmfiihrer Gecker(ph), and that was the SS. It\u2019s funny now this calls the \u2014 the [indecipherable]. So the SS, they were \u2014 they were terrible. They \u2014 they were still much worse than the Wehrmacht, because the Wehrmacht you found sometimes between the same guards, who were schoolteachers, who were, you know, they\u2019re \u2014 they were \u2014 they were called to \u2014 to duty. But there were still certain aspects of \u2014 of humanity, at one point, you know. But this \u2014 this [indecipherable] came in, and then they declared that as a concentration camp. So we came \u2014 we became a\u2014 a-\u2014a-\u2014ina different status, whereby this was right after \u2014 after the big aktia(ph), which was October 20\" \u2014 28\", 1941, is when they \u2014 when they came in with loudspeakers and they announced that next morning, five o\u2019clock in the morning, after we have in a \u2014 in a special \u2014 a special large place, that everybody has to be out. Nobody can stay in the house. Not even the sick people can stay in the house. Everybody has to be out. If they find somebody inside, they will shoot him. So, next morning, everybody came out, and the \u2014 took some food, and they \u2014 they said that you take \u2014 if you had some food, take with you, because you\u2019re not going to be provided with any \u2014 any food. So everybody came out, and suddenly a few German trucks came in, and it was \u2014 with guards, and they \u2014 they  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick \u2122 September 22, 1994 surrounded the place, and then the \u2014 the head of the Gestapo that time was a guy by the name of Rauca. Joseph, I think was his name, Rauca, and was a big German, a heavyset guy, and they came with dogs, and they started \u2014 they started \u2014 first of all, they searched houses, spot searched, whatever they can find somebody. And they as-assured themselves nobody there. They start pulling people to the left and to the right. Well, right away we saw that the people that they pulled to the left are mostly children, elderly people, people who are \u2014 have some blemish, or have some \u2014 some \u2014 some kind of paleness, or some kind of defect, you know. And I remember I had a little coat, you know, was a \u2014 was a fur \u2014 you know, the \u2014 the collar. So \u2014 and it was a cold \u2014 a cold [indecipherable] was October, it was already winter, basically in the \u2014 almost snow was \u2014 we were going to see. There were signs that snow was going to fall there. So then, I had my \u2014 my grandmother was with me, and I knew that they are going to call her. So, it was like instinctively, you know, when they pull her away. And when the German turned around, I pulled her back, and I was able to save her, you know, right, yeah, she was still with us for a couple more years afterward. But then they \u2014 they took out all those people, and they took them away. And that was a whole day operation, and we came home. Of course, we understood that they are taking them to a certain special assignment. I would like also to mention that the \u2014 the 500 intelligentsia, the people that they took out right \u2014 right  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick \u201d September 22, 1994 after the ghetto was closed, we found out in the next few days, that those was the first 500 people that they took to the , and they shot them all. Because their aim and their interest was to \u2014 to get rid of the \u2014 of \u2014 of more intelligent people, or people who are \u2014 who can plan, and who were \u2014 who had certain \u2014 certain qualifications, you know, that they wanted to \u2014 to get rid of them right away. And \u2014 and then there \u2014 there were \u2014 they were ina certain way right, and they were, in a certain way they have accomplished their \u2014 their \u2014 their doing. Now this time \u2014 that was 500. Now this time, on October 28\", they took them also to the Ninth Fort, and they also shot them, and there were 10,000 of them. They \u2014 they had \u2014 they were more ready for these 10,000 than for the 500, because they already had excavated. They had \u2014 they had a brigade that they took ahead of time, and they didn\u2019t know what \u2014 that was a \u2014 a small aktion, which they took about a few dozen people. And their \u2014 their job was to excavate in the vicinity of the Ninth Fort. And fort was large, you know, those forts were established by the Russians, and they were specially kept for \u2014 for protection of the city. You see, Kovno was surrounded by the Third Fort, the Seventh Fort, the Ninth Fort. There were like four forts. And they were done by the \u2014 still by the \u2014 by the Russians. They were at high \u2014 at high levels, and \u2014 and they were \u2014 had a \u2014 places for \u2014 for \u2014 for soldiers, and \u2014 and \u2014 and of course they had places for  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick \u201d September 22, 1994 inmates. So they \u2014 those were the 10,000 that were \u2014 they \u2014 they liquida \u2014 so they actually cut by one-third, right away, the ghetto. This was also in conjunction with the burning, and with the \u2014 of the small ghetto. You see, when the ghetto was instituted, they had the large ghetto, and they had the small ghetto. What was the difference? The difference was that one main thoroughfare, one main road, run through the \u2014 through the ghetto, between the small and the large. And what they did is \u2014 what they \u2014 what they did is they instituted a \u2014 they built a bridge from the large ghetto to the small ghetto, which was also surrounded with wires, and that was always under military supervision. So the \u2014 the beginning, and this \u2014 in the small ghetto they had a hospital. There was a hospital that they converted, they have arranged for that, and they had a hospital with very, very \u2014 we had quite a number of doctors, and had quite a number of \u2014 of \u2014 of patients, people who were ill, who were sick, who were \u2014 who were old, who needed \u2014 who needed care, and there were also some women who were pregnant, you know. So this hospital was full to capacity. And one day what they decided is that \u2014 that they felt that \u2014 apparently that they don\u2019t need a hospital, and they don\u2019t need no sick people. So what they did is they surrounded the hospital, they surrounded that with haystack around. They poured gas. They nailed the doors in the hospital, and they burned \u2014 everybody was burned there, including the doctors, including the nurses, including the \u2014 including  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 the \u2014 including the pregnant women, including the \u2014 there was such a terrible \u2014 I mean, the \u2014 the \u2014 you \u2014 you could smell the \u2014 the \u2014 the stench, you know, the \u2014 the people. And right after that they had the \u2014 the big aktia(ph), and then they \u2014 they eliminated completely \u2014 this small ghetto was completely, those few people who still were there were evacuated, were passed to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the bigger ghetto, because it became more room available by \u2014 by eliminating 10,000 people, it was too much room, you know, basically, based \u2014 based on they \u2014 on their standard. But this was a terrible, terrible, terrible act of aggression, you know, the \u2014 this \u2014 this was \u2014 in human history you find these cases only in times of the Romans, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 which also they had more compassion, you know, for certain \u2014 for \u2014 like for children, for \u2014 for \u2014 for \u2014 for babies, and then old people and so on."

And one of them is that this incredible experience that I had. And namely, they start bringing, to the railroad station, echelons \u2014 boxcars with the Jews from Austria and Germany. They called that, we found out later, the Hebrew siedlung. Hebrew siedlung basically means, place from one \u2014 take them from one place and put them to other place, in German. And these train came with cars loaded with pianos, with furniture, with all kinds of luxury items, to make believe to those people, when they \u2014 because you see, when they took out from Germany or from Austria, Jews to send them to \u2014 to their \u2014 to their massacre, to their \u2014 I mean, to their \u2014 to their graves, to their killings, was \u2014 apparently, they had a certain \u2014 a certain \u2014 had to handle it in a certain way. They tried to convince them that they are being taken to other place, just only to \u2014 they have to take them to \u2014 to \u2014 to other places. So when they came \u2014 and at that time, I was working for the Gestapo brigade. There was a special brigade which was the Gestapo brigade and many people have tried very hard to work in this brigade, because this brigade was always connected with certain \u2014 certain things that had to do with food. And there was many possibilities to \u2014 to fill up your stomach, you know, to be \u2014 to \u2014 not to be hungry. And this time they needed additional \u2014 additional people. So apparently, they took me and they took a \u2014 a group of other people to that task. And I \u2014 and I saw the way this echelons came, and I saw that they came in \u2014 in like, in plush  http://collections.ushmm.org  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Abe Resnick ~ September 22, 1994 trains. It was not the \u2014 the \u2014 some \u2014 some boxcars came also at the same time, but they came for a \u2014 for \u2014 for a purpose of \u2014 of baggage and \u2014 and some other things. But these trains came with \u2014 and the people with their jewelry, with everything, and \u2014and you could see very high standard people who came. And I knew exactly what they are doing with \u2014 what they are going to do with them. Before \u2014 this Rauca came over to us, he pulled out his pistol and we were like, six trucks, six guys, and he said to us \u2014 he said, you see, I forbid you to communicate and to talk to these people. There is no way that you can exchange some words, absolutely nothing. If I see your lips moving, I know that you are trying to tell them something or give \u2014 send them a message, so there is going to be nothing else than a bullet through your head. And he just like, took his pistol and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and just scraped our \u2014 our \u2014 our faces, you know, with that, to \u2014 to \u2014 to impress upon us that he means business, you know. The difficulty was by knowing what \u2014 what\u2019s going to happen to those people. How do we tell them \u2014 or whether \u2014 whether to tell them was the right thing, or not to tell them. It was so difficult. Now, our task was to take out from the windows, a German with \u2014 with loudspeaker would say to the \u2014 say to one of the cars \u2014 plush cars and say [speaks German]. It means, give me your packs. You have a few kilometers. You have to go a few kilometers, please give out your packages because it\u2019s going to be very burdensome and we are going \u2014 pla-placing  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick \" September 22, 1994 these packages in the trucks and we are going to deliver them. And make sure to inscribe your names on the packages so we are going to know how to return that to you. I knew that that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s fallacy. I mean, this 1s \u2014 where they are taking them is to the Ninth Fort and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s about 10 or 12 miles walking. It\u2019s not a couple of kilometers. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen to them. And in one case, I saw a lady, which I \u2014 pretty young lady, and \u2014 and I really felt \u2014 with her husband, felt \u2014 a couple apparently \u2014 and I felt very bad and I \u2014 I tried to \u2014 to explain to them, to tell them that \u2014 of course, we were already involved in taking the packages, and \u2014 and I \u2014I-\u2014TI looked around, I didn\u2019t see Rauca there, apparently he went to have something to drink or something. And \u2014 and I said to them that, they are taking you to your death. Try \u2014 when \u2014 when you \u2014 when \u2014 when you will march, try to \u2014 to escape or try to \u2014 to do something or something. You know, the people didn\u2019t believe me. They just didn\u2019t trust me. They trusted the Germans by that time, but they didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t trust me. They looked at me and looked at me, and they looked at me like I am \u2014 like I am trying to \u2014 and then I \u2014 I \u2014I felt very bad about the fact \u2014 I mean, I\u2014 I \u2014I\u2014I felt scared that they should not \u2014 they should not give me \u2014 turn me over, or say that I tried to \u2014 to tell them.

There was the \u2014 the understanding was that the Germans were very much afraid of the woods, because there were \u2014 there was already started a resistance. But you see, there were a douple \u2014a double \u2014 a double problem in this respect, because to get out from the ghetto, and to reach the woods, you had to cross, and you had to \u2014 to cr \u2014 g-get involved with some \u2014 with some Lithuanians, in \u2014 in many cases, and you really didn\u2019t know \u2014 you see, they were not the Germans. The \u2014 the biggest problem were the Lithuanians, because they know \u2014 they knew the Germans wouldn\u2019t \u2014 wouldn\u2019t differentiate a Jew from a Lithuanian, but the Lithuanians did \u2014 did \u2014 did \u2014 did know that. From my \u2014 for instance myself, I \u2014 I had few friends who were by themselves, and they \u2014 they decided they\u2019re going to join the \u2014 the partisans. There was a very good friend of mine, he was the son of the rabbi from Sakiai. Sakiai was a small city in Lithuania. [indecipherable] Golden.

They had a \u2014 they \u2014 they had a fight between them and the \u2014 and \u2014 and the Germans, he was wounded. And they had to amputate his leg. And something happens th \u2014 happened that this is very, very, very \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s sometimes very hard to describe that. Til this day, I don\u2019t know who this was, because they wouldn\u2019t \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t say. They were a few of his colleagues. They had to pull a straw who should kill him, because they had to move out from this place and they didn\u2019t want to leave him suffering. So one \u2014 one \u2014 one of them pulled the straw and \u2014 and had to pull \u2014 put a bullet in his head, because they just couldn\u2019t cope with somebody that was wounded, was ha \u2014 that his leg had to be amputated, you know.

And I will explain to you, and that\u2019s the reason why I wanted to tell you the story, what \u2014 what it came \u2014 what \u2014 what I learned to do. I used to \u2014 in many cases, I used to take out the \u2014 my \u2014 take off my stars. I used to go out and \u2014 and exchange \u2014 I used to have like shirts, or something else, you know, if I didn\u2019t  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick m September 22, 1994 have, I used to take from somebody else, became some \u2014 something like a \u2014 like a business. And then one day, we had our [indecipherable] the factory of the marmalade on one side of the street. On the other side of the street was a company by the name of Pieno(ph) Sendris(ph). That was a milk products, I would call it a factory, processing place, where they used to make yogurt, and \u2014 and buttermilk, and everything made from milk products. One say, while working in sadiva(ph), at break time, when we had lunch, I came down to the basement, and then I saw in the basement a \u2014 like a sewer pipe. A large pipe, was maybe 20 some inches of diameter. And then I start putting two and two together. I saw that pipe with direction was toward the street, and I told my f \u2014 one of my friends that I had there \u2014 and he happened to be his \u2014 his life as friends. We became sick later, and I \u2014 he used to work, and he used to help and was [indecipherable] told him, Louis Prowther(ph) is his name, he is now an engineer, he lives in Israel. I said, Louis, watch out for me. Let me see what\u2019s on the other end of the pipe. And I climbed in and I climbed through the pipe. And when I came out, I came out to the \u2014 to the heating place, you know, to the \u2014 you know, where they have the \u2014 the heating place for the \u2014 for the \u2014 for \u2014 for the building of the \u2014 the processing building of \u2014 you know, where they had the \u2014 the \u2014 what is that called?

And \u2014 and the guy, I saw a guy, a Lithuanian guy that was there, he just got  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick \u201d September 22, 1994 \u2014 got \u2014 got \u2014 got scared when he saw, because for the pipe was there, then I came out like from a chimney, you know. I s \u2014 I am sure that he felt that the devil coming out there. But then I identified myself, I say I am from \u2014 from the other side, from the sadiva(ph), and I would like to find out what is \u2014 about their products what they have, whether there is a possibility that we can bring in some products of \u2014 milk products in the ghetto. To make the story short, from that day, I became very friendly with this guy, and I used to bring different items, exchange with him, and I used to carry back to the ghetto, all kinds of milk products. And they gave me a nickname, they called me Tevye the Milchhiker, you know, from shalo \u2014 from \u2014 from Sholem Aleichem, you know, that, from the \u2014 the famous play, you know, Tevye the Milkman?

So he was also one of those officers. I mean, they \u2014 they asked for the whole police force to gather, and then when they gathered, the first car that came out \u2014 the buses were behind, the first car came out, it\u2019s like a\u2014 a Jeep, and came out three Germans, and this was \u2014 and I was watching through the window what happened, I was inside the house. And they told to the police, they \u2014 to get in \u2014 into \u2014 in two lines, one behind the other one, three lines. And three rows [indecipherable]. And then they told them \u2014 they asked each of them they should mention their name. And right afterward, they told them they should sit down on the ground, suddenly.

            "answer": "Where \u2014 where \u2014 where \u2014 where in the ghetto, at the children\u2019s aktion, it was specially devised to get out all of the children from the ghetto. And in order to implement that, they had also to take out all the police because this was also \u2014 there were also children from the police officers, and \u2014 and you know how a father would react seeing his child being dragged and beaten and taken to a \u2014 to a bus and then taken away. So after this \u2014 this happened \u2014 and this was very fast, you know, they \u2014 they had a big number of \u2014 of gendarmes, of SS people who \u2014 who implemented this function. They went from house to house and they \u2014 they knew exactly which house had children. They had already a list. Apparently, previously they have \u2014 they have asked for the \u2014 for the composition of the people who lived in the \u2014 in each \u2014 in each house. You know, it was \u2014 so they \u2014 they had certain records, or somebody gave them the records. And they indiscriminately \u2014 I mean, they have \u2014 they have walked into each house, pulled out \u2014 pulled out the children. And most of the children were \u2014 especially the \u2014 the older ones were \u2014 their mothers were \u2014 were at work at this time. There were only a number of mothers who, when they took the children, they didn\u2019t want to go with their kids. They wouldn't let them \u2014 let them stay with the kids, so they beat them up and they just kicked them and then they  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick \" September 22, 1994 took away the children. And the mothers were devastated. And especially now at \u2014 at six, seven o'clock, when the people start returning from \u2014 from work, and when they found out this news, it was such a outcry. It was such a tremendous outcry that \u2014 that ev \u2014 everybody was crying and everybody was \u2014 was \u2014 was devastated. It was something that some people throw themse \u2014 threw themself on the \u2014 on the barbed wire, you know, to \u2014 to \u2014 to see whether they just can just get out and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and do something. And people \u2014 really, the mothers didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t care \u2014 care for their life anymore. They \u2014 they \u2014 they just wanted to join them, to be together with their \u2014 with their children. And the police officers \u2014 the way we \u2014 we found out later, they were \u2014 they were investigated, to find out whether there are some kids who were hidden, like we were \u2014 we hid the \u2014 my \u2014 my cousin, who was really about, at that time, about three years, three and a half years, maybe four years. And besides that, they want also to know where \u2014 because they had information at that time \u2014 It was already \u201844 and they knew that there were many, many, many, many freedom fighters who \u2014 who st \u2014 his \u2014 have still a communication with the ghetto, and they had apparently \u2014 it was felt that \u2014 also that the police \u2014 certain police officer have helped some, and still helping some of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the freedom fighter. So they wanted to find out, and they shot quite a number of police officers. They shot this Greenberg(ph) who \u2014 who \u2014 who was very instrumental. They  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  86 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 tortured him and shot him, and he would not divulge, and would not give out where the \u2014 where the hiding places were. And then the rest of those police officers, they \u2014 part of them \u2014 they returned back \u2014 back to the ghetto, became devastated and found also their \u2014 their children gone. And the \u2014 it was really \u2014 the \u2014 the feeling, I mean, was \u2014 that was so bad, you know, that the \u2014 the whole situation created an incredible loss of \u2014 of hope, you know, when you saw something like this. And this was March and it \u2014 it was already when the Russians have advanced already, substantially towards \u2014 towards the west \u2014 towards \u2014 towards \u2014 they liberated already many, many cities in \u2014 in Russia and they were \u2014 they were moving towards \u2014 towards Lithuania. And that was an episode which is \u2014 which was very, very tragic, you know, very \u2014 even difficult to \u2014 to describe this. This is \u2014 sometimes we are talking between ourselves, some survivors, and \u2014 and we exchange \u2014 exchange views. And the \u2014 the \u2014 the question is, between one survivor and the other one is, how to make people understand what we went through. I mean, this is \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 you see, you are limited in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in being able to understand it when \u2014 when somebody tells you something, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 because their \u2014 our \u2014 our minds are \u2014 are in a certain way limited. We cannot understand beyond this limit, you know. And it is, how can somebody describe certain things that like? How can somebody describe that a German SS man takes a  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  87 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 child of a year old, takes him by his legs and smashes him with his head against \u2014 against a wall? I mean, how can \u2014 I mean, this is \u2014 it \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not even \u2014 even in the most substandard countries, I mean, it\u2019s happening, you know. They \u2014 they kill people, they massacre people, but \u2014 but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s only \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to describe and it\u2019s hard to believe. Sometimes I myself, it\u2019s hard for me to believe that \u2014 that \u2014 it looks to me like a bad nightmare, rather than that it truly happened, you know. An-And \u2014 and time was going so slow, you know. The \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the worst part is that although you worked so hard and you did all kind of \u2014 I didn\u2019t even mention some other work that I used to do, you know. They took us to the \u2014 to the army barracks in \u2014 sometimes and we had to clean out latrines and something else, you know, they \u2014 and some \u2014 sometimes they took some people and they just threw them into the latrine, I know, just only to \u2014 to have a little pastime for themselves, you know. So I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s beyond \u2014 beyond description. So that\u2019s \u2014 so that\u2019s one of the reasons why we meet together with survivors sometimes, and we share experiences, we \u2014 we \u2014 we can understand it much better than \u2014 than \u2014 than explaining that to the outer world, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 and it\u2019s very hard to believe that a country so advanced, you know, was \u2014 was get \u2014 getting children and then [indecipherable] and all this. That were \u2014 that were able \u2014 that wer \u2014 came down to a level, to such a level, to \u2014 to \u2014 to be so destructive and so  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick \u2122 September 22, 1994 without hearts, without \u2014 so the ghetto was \u2014 th-this was a \u2014 at that \u2014 at that stage, it was already a camp, yeah. Now, next move was that we decided that we cannot keep our \u2014 my uncle decided that he cannot keep anymore his daughter there. So we made contact through a \u2014 there was a rabbi\u2019s wife, Shuman(ph) was her name. And I\u2019m sure that she \u2014 she is going to surface in some of your \u2014 some of the places. She was a \u2014 an incredible lady. She was a rabbi\u2019s wife. Her husband was in Israel \u2014 in Palestine already. And she \u2014 some way he left before that. And she was matchmaking. She was out \u2014 without the \u2014 without the \u2014 the stars. She was going around and finding places to harbor children. So some \u2014 somebody told us about her and we were in \u2014 contacted her, and \u2014 and she found a place for Sulami(ph), which was my \u2014 my \u2014 my cousin. She was three and a half, or four years old at that time. My \u2014 my aunt laughs always, she says that I\u2014 I \u2014 I used to have an incredible appetite, you know. And I used to watch, you know \u2014 she used to give her \u2014 sometimes we were able to smuggle in tapioca. You know what is? It\u2019s a\u2014 and I used to sit quietly and watch that and pray that she should not eat the tapioca so it would be left over for me to eat. So she always \u2014 so we decided to do \u2014 how would \u2014 we would do that. At that time, we had two SS people in the ghetto. One name was Fiffiger(ph) and the other name was \u2014 what was the other name? It will come to me pretty soon. Yeah, it\u2019s [indecipherable] Fiffiger(ph) was a former teacher  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick ia September 22, 1994 and he was \u2014 very much befriended my uncle. He was very nice. He was a SS, and he told the story that he was forced into the SS. And he \u2014 he expressed very good sentiments. So my uncle had to put his confidence \u2014 he showed in \u2014 in few cases, he showed that he was \u2014 he was helpful. And we could see that he is not one of these \u2014 one of these beasts, you know. So my uncle explained to him and \u2014 and he knew that we are having the child there, and \u2014 against all odds, and he promised my uncle that he is going to help him out. This was a remarkable \u2014 but his comrade, his friend, whose name I forgot, was just the opposite. Just the opposite. What he did once was also beyond \u2014 he encouraged people \u2014 he opened up the \u2014 he opened up th-this \u2014 anyway, first, let me finish with Fiffiger(ph). So they arranged that the \u2014 the \u2014 the bread was coming in twice a week with these big platforms, and then the horses with a driver were going out. So we arranged to \u2014 I gave her the sleeping pill. We put her in a bag because they \u2014 it used to come in bags. So we put her in one of the bags. And we put her under a big \u2014 so they \u2014 she can go through the \u2014 through the gates. Because the gates, they always used to stick something to find where there\u2019s sometimes hide. But it was already prearranged, you know, that apparently he \u2014 he \u2014 he did that \u2014 Fiffiger(ph) did that, you know. And we were able to get her out and she was given away to \u2014 to a very nice Lithuanian family. They took care \u2014 they even baptized her and made her like a part of the \u2014 and she  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick \" September 22, 1994 spoke only Lithuanian and she was \u2014 she fortunately survived. In exchange, my uncle \u2014 the police officer who was shot, his little boy was also given out to somebody. But he was betrayed and they killed him. Apparently, this Lithuanian that took him was given \u2014 were given certain things in order to do that. They betrayed him and he was \u2014 and we found out later that he was \u2014 he was killed.

            "answer": "Well, towards the end of the 1943, we s \u2014 we saw certain movements in a  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick \" September 22, 1994 different direction. We \u2014 we felt that there is some kind of changes going to be implemented in the ghetto. And we really didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t know exactly. We felt that the guards were changed. We have \u2014 we have seen more \u2014 that was also a time when we have seen more Hungarians. They brought in Hungarians, and especially some truck drivers. One \u2014 one of them, which I knew pretty well, he was a very bad mouth, and \u2014 but he was not \u2014 not so bad. But the rest were very bad. He was Haymushi(ph). He was a Hungarian truck driver who \u2014 who worked very close with \u2014 with Pilgrim(ph) and \u2014 and Fiffiger(ph). He was, like, always with them. And we felt that by bringing in this nationalist, and by trying to put in more restrictions, and \u2014 and start \u2014 they started also watching more of the \u2014 all the movements and what\u2019s going on, what\u2019s happening in the ghetto. And they were very much concerned and very much were \u2014 were looking for \u2014 for some kind of supplies that the ghetto would supply, or the ghetto would produce, or the ghetto would have some contacts with \u2014 with the \u2014 with the freedom fighters. So in order to have a tighter watch, they \u2014 they have also tried to squeeze out from the police and see whether their police \u2014 to find within the police also some people who would \u2014 who would be on \u2014 on their side. They were not \u2014 were not too much able to \u2014 they had not been able to get from the \u2014 from the Jewish police, except in \u2014 in isolated case \u2014 cases, because the police was well aware of what \u2014 what was  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick \u201d September 22, 1994 happening. And they \u2014 they themselves \u2014 the ghetto was the \u2014 with the council in many occasions \u2014 and many cases have tried to help. And they were \u2014 they knew also sometimes the whereabouts of \u2014 of people who \u2014 who would go out to the forest an-and fight and in different measures and acts of terrorism and \u2014 and blowing up railroads, and sh \u2014 cutting off supplies, and \u2014 and shooting in many cases, in back of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the Germans. Although the Germans themselves, like \u2014 the Germans themselves, they \u2014 they \u2014 most of the time didn\u2019t dare to invade the forest, because the forest was for them, taboo. But they used for that purpose, they used Lithuanians, in many cases, to \u2014 to find out and to find out the right spots and then they would \u2014 they would be able to \u2014 to move in. We also saw the \u2014 not only by \u2014 by the change of the guard and by their behavior, we \u2014 we have felt a bigger presence in the ghetto of \u2014 of the military. Because normally, in all those years, they were \u2014 they were, most of the times, guar-guarding the ghetto from the outside and they were hardly \u2014 not too frequently, they \u2014 they used to come in and \u2014 and \u2014 and look for themselves, look in in certain aspects of the ghetto. Now, in the late \u201843, we have \u2014 we had a\u2014 a much bigger presence. There were also a repetition of \u2014 of people that \u2014 of requirements for \u2014 for labor force in some other \u2014 other places within Lithuania and \u2014 and outside of Lithuania, whereby they used to come and \u2014 and of course, make a selection, or they used to appeal to the \u2014 to the  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick \u201d September 22, 1994 council in order to provide them with \u2014 with \u2014 with those elements who can be useful for them. And most of the times, they \u2014 they \u2014 some of the times they also tried to get some people who \u2014 who had some skills, and tried to use them in the best of their \u2014 their ability. We have seen also that factories, in the \u2014 the verstattin(ph) have been over swamped with \u2014 with additional work. As the front was getting closer, there were more requirements and more necessities to \u2014 for \u2014 for \u2014 for the Germans, for their supplies, and they needed the \u2014 the help and the \u2014 and the cooperation of this verstattin(ph), so they used to work overtime. I mean, instead ten or 12 hours, they used to work 14 or 15 hours, you know. And they also implemented some shifts in that time. The \u2014 the underground movement grew faster and faster. They \u2014 they had now much better opportunities because the Lithuanians by themselves also were not dumb. They saw that the tide is changing. So they, in many cases, they tried to befriend, and \u2014 and to be a little bit more helpful. Although, the \u2014 the same orders still persisted that if they catch somebody that they would have a [indecipherable]. But we have seen that they \u2014 they were more aggressive in \u2014 in hiding people and in helping and \u2014 and in trying to make up for the \u2014 for the damages that they have done before. When the \u2014 in 1944, after the \u2014 after the children\u2019s aktion, and after we have \u2014 we have brought out our \u2014 my cousin from \u2014 from the ghetto, I myself started thinking of terms of \u2014 of getting  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  94 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 away.

At that time, I think \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m sure that in the ghetto were not left over more than four or 5,000 people, maybe now \u2014 maybe now from 33,000 that originally \u2014 so what they did is also \u2014 when \u2014 when they \u2014 when  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick \u00b0 September 22, 1994 they used to \u2014 when the ghetto became smaller \u2014 small-smaller in \u2014 1n \u2014 in population, they also start cutting off smaller in territory. What they did is, where we had the Varniu(ph) gatve where the \u2014 with the \u2014 with the [indecipherable] was the gate for the supplies, there was a \u2014 a\u2014 a number of houses that one day they came in and they took a \u2014 a\u2014a bunch of people, workers, and they didn't remove the fence that was the original fence. What they did is, they put in another fence, cutting off, like, four or five blocks from the \u2014 from the original one. So it became like a ghetto within a ghetto, you know. This was, in a certain way, to my personal advantage, you know, because \u2014 and maybe some others, which I \u2014 I \u2014 I do \u2014I don\u2019t know. I can speak for myself on it. What they did is, actually by \u2014 by putting a new fence and putting guards \u2014 putting guards around this fence, they have diminished the guards from the overall fence, which was before, even without taking off. So, what happened was that, when we used to go to work, we decided \u2014 I have a\u2014 had a \u2014 we were five \u2014 five people that we decided to \u2014 to flee the camp. We saw that \u2014 already that the time is running out. I spoke to \u2014 three times to one friend of mine that was in the \u2014 was in the \u2014 in the partisans. And he told me that whenever I want to join them I should \u2014 I should contact somebody, and \u2014 1n order to join them. The only thing 1s, after that I tried to get the \u2014 the other \u2014 th-the contact man and he was already gone, also. So I went to my \u2014 where my uncle was and I told him, look, I  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 96 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 think that it\u2019s no \u2014 no reason for me to remain here. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re close. We\u2019re very close to the end. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 they are going \u2014 one of these days, we are going to get up and we\u2019re going to find ourselves surrounded by \u2014 by trucks and they are \u2014 they are just going to take us, and \u2014 and \u2014 and ta-take us out and \u2014 and take us to camps, or take us somewhere else, or \u2014 or \u2014 or take us to the Ninth Fort. So my uncle, who was very conservative always \u2014 and he really was very close to me, was \u2014 was like \u2014 like a father to me, you know. And th-this was maybe one of reasons that \u2014 that I have not left the place sooner. And especially my grandmother, she was crazy about me, you know, she [indecipherable] that time when I saved her, you know, she \u2014 she would not \u2014 and we knew that she \u2014 she \u2014 also \u2014 also survived, you know, the \u2014 the children\u2019s aktion that time also when \u2014 because she was with a child inside, but her, we couldn\u2019t get \u2014 get her out, because well, it would be too \u2014 too difficult, you know. A child is something that \u2014 el-else. So what \u2014 so my uncle came to the conclusion, say that\u2019s fine and gave me his blessing, I mean, it \u2014 and I deciding to \u2014 now, how are we going to do it? SoI-\u2014I devised a plan, in other word, the houses which were behind the first \u2014 the general fence, a few houses still left. They have \u2014 normally, in many cases they would explode some of the houses. They would put in some dynamite and explode it. Here, they \u2014 they have \u2014 and \u2014 and they did it later on with the r\u2014 with the \u2014 with  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick \" September 22, 1994 the rest of the ghetto. So I had a \u2014I had three more people with me \u2014 three \u2014 four. There was one \u2014 one guy that was himself from Poland and for \u2014 some way he was stuck in \u2014 in \u2014 in Kovno, and never was able to get out. And then it was the nephew of \u2014 the nephew of my aunt, who is now in Charlotte, North Carolina. And then the other one was a guy that used to \u2014 frequently to come to our house. And then it was the other fellow that worked also with \u2014 was a nephew of somebody who worked with my \u2014 with my uncle. So, then this guy knew \u2014 supposedly he knew the road, how to \u2014 I mean, where to go in order to get to the forest."

We saw that the handwriting on the wall. We saw that everything what\u2019s happening with the Russian army, the victorious expelling, pushing the Germans towards \u2014 towards the \u2014 towards the  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  100 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 west. And we felt also that there is time for \u2014 for me and for some friends to \u2014 to get out and get out as soon as possible because every \u2014 every day was a matter that \u2014 we knew exactly that \u2014 what our fate was going to be. So truthfully, we didn't have too much to risk because one way or the other way, I mean, we would \u2014 we would not be able to survive. So I went to see my uncle and I told him that \u2014 and my grandmother, I told them that I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2014 I\u2019m ready, with \u2014 with my other fellow \u2014 fellow friends to \u2014 to get out, and to get out as fast. So my uncle I \u2014 my uncle also gave me a\u2014 he had like a little golden coin and he gave this to me and he said, look, in case of necessity or something, I mean, you \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he had like three of them, you know, so he was hiding that always in \u2014 somewhere. So when \u2014 soon I got together with my \u2014 with my friends and when we went to work, coming back we just evaded the guards and we came into one of the houses that we marked for \u2014 for our shelter in \u2014 in \u2014 in between, in order to be able to \u2014 to plan our \u2014 our escape. The \u2014 one of my friends was much younger than us, a couple of years, and he was a short one, and we used him as the outlook. So he used to look and to watch. And he was the one that timed the steps of the \u2014 of the guard on the outside of the fence, and then came to the conclusion. He gave us the signal, we came out, we cut through the wires and that was nighttime. And we just slipped out, all of us. Because we \u2014 really the security was behind us in the \u2014 in the smaller ghetto where  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick a September 22, 1994 there was double-rolled barbed wire. This was all \u2014 this was a old fence which they have never tried to repair because they were \u2014 there was \u2014 the ghetto was in the ghetto, you know. Now, when we had to \u2014 we slept over there in a\u2014ina\u2014ina garden, a dense garden. And in the morning we start going. But we left a distance between ourselves. Rather than walking in a group, we walked, like, one by one, some meters, one behind the other one. When we came through a \u2014 through a \u2014 with a bo \u2014 to a place where we had to cross the highway, there was one person with a \u2014 with a bicycle, and a rifle on his shoulder, a Lithuanian. And suddenly he came out and approached us, say, stop, documents. Raise your hands. So when he did that, we start running in different directions. It was only one person and we knew that he might shoot one but he cannot shoot everybody, you know. Besides that, his aim was not too good because I felt \u2014 when I run, I felt like, a couple bullets passing me and then I don't know. I \u2014I\u2014 I really ran like never in my life, and then I threw myself in the cornfield. I know also that later on when I was laying there for quite a while, I know that they \u2014 they had some \u2014 some people with horses try to locate somebody, and I hoped that they are not going to find anybody. But I, during nighttime I walked about additional half a mile and I saw ble \u2014 flickering lights. And I say to myself, without these \u2014 would that be headquarter \u2014 would \u2014 would that be quarters for the Germans or some barracks or something? Then I stepped  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick \u201d September 22, 1994 away and I found myself close to a small, small woods. And there I slept over the night. It was really \u2014 it was a little bit cold nighttime, but I covered myself with leaves and some other things. And there was a little \u2014 a little \u2014 I wouldn't say a river, but it was little place with \u2014 with water. And then I \u2014 I was hiding behind the bushes. In the morning, I heard some voices 1n Russian, and I \u2014 I watched that, and I saw that there \u2014 there, a woman came and she \u2014 apparently two friends, but one stayed with a \u2014 with a metal thing, you know, what they \u2014 they put here \u2014 put in cloth. And she started washing right there in this \u2014 where there was li \u2014 this was not even like a river, but it was a place that I remember that I had drunk water. I had my hat, so with my hat I used to take and \u2014 and \u2014 and drink the water. Because food was nothing. I \u2014 I used to collect some \u2014 some berries, you know, from wild berries, and this was my food. So I was desperate. I was very hungry and this woman was washing and I said to myself, let me \u2014 let me approach her. And I spoke perfect Russian, of course. So I came out. I said, look, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m escapee, and like you should help me with some food. So I was not sure whether she was going to go \u2014 first of all, I didn\u2019t know. I asked her what was there in this \u2014 in this place, where I saw the flickering lights in the night. And she said, no, that\u2019s a camp, a civilian ca- camp for civilian Russians. An intern camp for civilian Russians. But then she told me that she is going to come back and bring me some food. And I \u2014 I thought to  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick _ September 22, 1994 myself, I prayed, I said, or she is going to bring me food, or she is going to bring me a German who is going to \u2014 to kill me? About 15 minutes later she comes back with a bottle of milk and a piece of spee(ph) \u2014 you know, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s from \u2014 it\u2019s like meat, fat meat, you know \u2014 and a piece of bread. And then I started talking to her and she said to me that she got scared when she saw me, because I looked like I\u2019m an old, you know, the \u2014 and I explained to her that I\u2019m a refugee, and so forth. And so she said to me, look, we have in our camp two Russian prisoners who \u2014 who fled, and who are hiding in our \u2014 in this \u2014 in this camp. And they also are going to \u2014 they are planning to go to join the \u2014 the freedom fighters, the partisans. And where they are going? They are going to Janava, Janava, Belder(ph), that used to be Janava, the forest of Janava, which was not too far away from there. And this guy Scheiker(ph), that was with me, he \u2014 he \u2014 he was leaving us, and he told us, and he explained to me, because he himself was from Janava, and he told us \u2014 he gave me certain \u2014 certain parameters. But now, I mean, he was \u2014 he was gone, so I had to do that myself. So then, in the \u2014 in the evening, sh-sh \u2014 the two Russians came over. They had knives for themselves, and they asked me a few questions, and they wanted to verify whether I am legit and I shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 I shouldn't be some \u2014 the bay \u2014 betray them. And then the next morning, early in the morning, we went to the woods, we approached them, and one of them had apparently a contact, or he knew  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  104 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 exactly a certain spot. First of all, th-the Russian prisoners were not treated very friendly by the Russians, because Stalin\u2019s \u2014 Stalin\u2019s view was that the Russians should never fell in a prisoner life, I mean, he should give his life for the country. But of course, this \u2014 that was not the case. So he took us to the forms \u2014 forest at one point and he \u2014 then we met about three or four more guys there. They were from the \u2014 from \u2014 apparently also, they were former Russian prisoners. And they had already a plan, a top \u2014 topographic plan, and they had all rolls. So they said that they have received some supplies from \u2014 from parachutes that they \u2014 and they had some assignment to watch and to see whether some German forces are going \u2014 if they are going to be close by, they have to communicate and they have to try to do certain sabotage \u2014 sabotage work. We spent about, I would say, maybe about close to 20 days moving around from one spot to the other one, because we didn\u2019t want to stay in one spot. And on few occasions \u2014 I was not trained, I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t know anything about \u2014 about ammunition or anything. They have done, basically, the work. And the \u2014 in \u2014 in different cases, I was the look out. They used me to be the look out. They had some \u2014 some light arms and knives basically, and they had some back packs with \u2014 with ammunition. We spent, I would say, about four weeks. And one \u2014 one day, we heard a movement. We put our ears \u2014 normally, what we used to do is, we used to put our ears to the grounds, so we can detect \u2014 that\u2019s a way of  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection  105 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 detect whether there is some heavy movements. And here we detected that some \u2014 based on our imaginations, some tanks. And now we saw about three or four German tanks rolling not too far away, you know. And then about a couple hours later, we heard some shootings, and an exchange of fire. And this whole neighborhood vicinity became like a \u2014 like a \u2014 like a military, I mean, hell. Because bullets and flying out the \u2014 in the shrubs, and saw burning \u2014 burning bushes and all this, you know. It was an incredible, incredible exchange of fire. Then, it lasted for about an hour, an hour and a half, and it looked to me that it lasted forever, you know. Because we found ourselves in the middle and we said to ourselves, now we are going to be killed by \u2014 by friendly \u2014 by friendly \u2014 our friendly power \u2014 gun power. Suddenly, it quietened down. It was quiet like nothing \u2014 I mean, like \u2014 like nothing ever \u2014 anything happened, you know. And I say to the \u2014 to one of Russians, I say, what \u2014 what would that be? I mean it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s too quiet, I mean, we got used already to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the incredible sound of \u2014 of \u2014 of explosions, you know. And then suddenly we heard again, we put \u2014 the Russian put his \u2014 he put his ear on the ground. He said, something is happening. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s quite apparently, but something is happening. And, like 45 minutes later, we heard \u2014 we heard some movement of, like, troops. Not too many. And then we saw the first Russians approaching us. And the first question was \u2014 the first question was, have you seen  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection  106 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 some tanks? I sort of, yeah, we saw quite a few hours ago. And he said, no, these tanks already finished. Have you seen some other tanks? And we say, no. Right away it was \u2014 I was amazed, you know, because right away I \u2014 I was approached by \u2014 by one of the lieutenants. I think it was a captain, not a lieutenant \u2014 captain, because he had three stars, yeah. It was a captain, and he \u2014 he actually told me that \u2014 he looked at me and looked at me and says, are you Jewish? I say yes. So am I, he said. Okay, we embraced each other and he \u2014 right away what he did is, he told us \u2014 he said, look, this is the front line, and the line might change, because we don\u2019t know what \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014 what is ha \u2014 what can \u2014 what is going to happen a few kilometers from here. My advice is, and what I want to see you, is to the till. Till 1s towards the back, towards the [indecipherable], you know, towards the back, you know. And right away, he called a\u2014 a\u2014a soldier and he said, take these guys and take them over. And \u2014 and in meantime, we was already approaching some Jeeps and some \u2014 some other \u2014 some other military units. And he told us to move as far as possible towards the back. He said, you went through already, it\u2019s sufficient. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 and th-this was the \u2014 this was actually the \u2014 the \u2014 the way that we \u2014 so happy. I mean, the first time we felt like \u2014 felt like liberated, you know. And then he asked me \u2014 another guy that he referred me to ask me some question. He said me whether I want to join the army, or I want to do. I said, no, no, first what I want to  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick aa September 22, 1994 do is, I want to go \u2014 I want to see \u2014 because my question was, how soon are they going to liberate Kaunas? He said, that might take still a few days or \u2014 or it might still take some \u2014 some time. So we were with the army for about \u2014 I think about ten or 15 days til they have to [indecipherable] Kaunas and to liberate it. I went right away to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the ghetto. The ghetto was exploded. Everything, all the houses were exploded. They have \u2014 some people came out from the hiding in some places. Some people came out from hiding. I went to this place where we were hiding and we had some photographs and I found some photographs. But supplies and other things that we had in \u2014 in our \u2014 in our house, and in the ground was nothing. It was like, everything burned. And right away I went to \u2014 to Kaunas. This was Slobodka. I went to Kaunas, I got myself \u2014 right away I met with this officer, that he told me that he is going to \u2014 he is \u2014 I mean, that he 1s going to be coming to Kaunas, and he gave me a number where I can \u2014 I can reach him. And he told me that if I have some \u2014 some kind of desire of some \u2014 something. I said, yeah, I would like to have \u2014 I have some \u2014 I have some relatives here, and I would like to see whether I can find them. Where \u2014 where are there \u2014 I\u2014 I am sure \u2014 I felt they were very optimistic. I said maybe there are some relatives that I have. And I start floundering around for quite a few days. And then I found a family, that we were together in the ghetto and then later, they went to Canada. But I used to send them  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick _ September 22, 1994 packages when I was in there \u2014 when \u2014 just a minute \u2014 that I send them packages after, when I \u2014 when I \u2014 when I was in the army. They \u2014 I helped them to find a place \u2014 a living place because the \u2014 the city was \u2014 was devastated, you know. There \u2014 there was not too many \u2014 too big fights in the city, but it was many have escaped and left behind themselves apartments with furniture, and you know, like \u2014 the same way like when the \u2014 when the \u2014 when the Germans came in. So right away I found a\u2014a friend of mine, who told me that if I would like to serve \u2014 to serve in the \u2014 in the Russian army because, due to the fact that I have finished gymnasium, and I speak the \u2014 I speak Lithuanian, German, and \u2014 an-and Russian, so I would be a good prospect. He se \u2014 he told me that there is coming a \u2014 a group of \u2014 a\u2014 a group of people to \u2014 of military men to take some \u2014 to take \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 they are looking for some inper \u2014 interpreter. They need very badly people who speak Lithuanian and Russian. Basically German is not, at this point, is not important, but it\u2019s going to become important later. And at the same time, they promulgated a law that all these people from this and this year, they are going to be \u2014 they are going to be from 1924, 1925, 1926, they are going to be taken to the army \u2014 to the regular army. And I say to myself, I would rather serve in a specialty unit than \u2014 than to wait and then be recruited to the army. They have like a place where they called wayan(ph) komat(ph). This is a\u2014 a\u2014a military place, whereby they check out new \u2014 they  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick _ September 22, 1994 check out prospective soldiers, you know, health-wise and whether they have TB because there were many with \u2014 with TB, you know, from those that survived. So I actually signed up for this \u2014 for this unit. I remember a younger captain came in and \u2014 and interviewed me and he was satisfied. And then what he told me that he is going to recruit me and I will have to go through a short preparation \u2014 military preparation of about six weeks. And I agreed. In meantime, he told me I can \u2014 I can stay there and he gave me a official paper where I can go and find myself a\u2014a-\u2014a apartment. So I found my relatives, those I mentioned, and I found myself not too far away where I used to live before, on the same [indecipherable] on same main street. I got myself a nice apartment and my relatives were very happy. They had two children and \u2014 and myself and I told them, look, I am going to be just here, and only temporary, and I am \u2014 I am going to be leaving. And also, was very interesting walking on the \u2014 when I got myself a bicycle an-and riding on the bike, I met a very good friend of mine, this Harmutz(ph), who was the \u2014 the head of the ORT. He wasn\u2019t in the ghetto and he was involved in the partisans. And he esca \u2014 I mean, he joined in also in the army but in the civilian department. They made him a \u2014 like a commissar, or something, in the civilian department because he \u2014 he had excellent contacts in the \u2014 with some high-ranking people. So I met with him and it was incredible, incredible meeting, you know, to \u2014 in \u2014 in middle of \u2014 of \u2014 of nowhere  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick _ September 22, 1994 or something like, you know, in the middle of the city, to meet somebody that was such a close friend of mine. Then, from there, I \u2014 I was \u2014 I was sent toa\u2014toa\u2014toa training camp, and in about six weeks they send me to the first mission. I mean, I was recruited, got the uniform, got my \u2014 they sent me within Lithuania, in certain places to \u2014 to be attached to the \u2014 there was also \u2014 you see, there was also a Lithuanian brigade under the Commander Vilinski(ph), who was \u2014 which was formed right when the war \u2014 in the beginning of the war. Very brave. Many of those people died in \u2014 in deep Russia, you know, and it was incredible, really. But I didn\u2019t \u2014 I joined the regular ar-army, which I \u2014 I said that is a policing force, which is called the \u2014 it was the 33rd regiment of the [indecipherable] NK VD, which was the border police, attached to the NK VD. After the training and after they send me to Lithuania, they send me to a place, to Liepaja, which was Courland, in \u2014 that was in Latvia. And there \u2014 there we had big \u2014 a big fight because there were \u2014 there were the \u2014 I don't know whether you heard about the Vlasovtsy. That is a General Vlasov, a Ukrainian who joined the Germans and he created a Ukrainian \u2014 Ukrainian battalion. Alway \u2014 almost the army, who fought with the Germans against the Russians, against their own people. So there were entrenched the \u2014 a group of \u2014 of those people, and they fought tooth and nail because they knew that if they are going to be captured, they are going to be killed [indecipherable]. They  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 111  Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 wouldn't take them as prisoners. And there I had my \u2014 my first accident. I was in a Jeep with a \u2014 with a captain, and \u2014 and a driver, and there was a big shelling, and it hit the Jeep, and I was just knocked out fro-from the Jeep, and I found myself later in the hospital. Thanks God I had only two broken ribs and \u2014 and small \u2014 small contusions and some \u2014 some other things, you know. But the captain who was sitting next to me was killed, a Russian captain. And then from there, I \u2014 they sent me after I \u2014 took me about 14, 15 days to \u2014 to be back on my feet \u2014 they \u2014 they send me to Germany, was to ca \u2014 and participate in \u2014 in liberating the City of Konigsburg, which was very interesting. And from there, they came a order to \u2014 after a while, came an order \u2014 a special order, that our regiment was going to be sent entirely to the [indecipherable] Islands, to the Japanese front. And I was the only one that got the assignment to join Chuikov\u2019s army in the direction of Berlin. And this was \u2014 and I feel that this was because the \u2014 the colonel that was in charge, Venakurov(ph), I think it was, Jewish. And I \u2014 I told him once, I said, look \u2014 I pleaded with him, I told him, look, I\u20141if you are going to send me to the [indecipherable] Islands, I am going to be of no use, and I am in the mood, you know, to \u2014 to take vengeance for \u2014 for my people, and I \u2014 I think my place wil \u2014 should be on the German front rather than on the \u2014 on the Japanese front. So next day, I \u2014 I found a \u2014 a \u2014 it\u2019s called kommandi(ph) rofka(ph). That means my  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 112 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 assignment to travel. And this is when I traveled through Warsaw. I remember traveling through Warsaw bridge, it took us maybe an hour to pass this bridge, because the bridge was completely damaged and the train was going slowly through that. And then there I joined the \u2014 I joined Chuikow\u2019s forces. And this was incredible experience, incredible experience. Then we marched, I mean we went \u2014 when we \u2014 we continued to Berlin and we also liberated a concentration camp of Sachsenhausen.

And \u2014 and we used to get him as \u2014 as informers. So we have them on our list, we had a \u2014 one of the informers was a \u2014 had a gramophone factory. They\u2019re  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection  124 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 the one who had the slaughterhouse. One has a \u2014 like a other type of factory, I don\u2019t remember what was. So what \u2014 I used to have a motorcycle, with a side one. So those people were redeemed in a certain way. There was al-always the sword of Damocles was hanging over their \u2014 over their neck, you know. But they were, in a certain way, so long they were able to form, and to give all the information about some more bigger fish, you know. So once a week we used to \u2014 they used to come to our compou \u2014 to our compound \u2014 I mean \u2014 and they used to meet with the \u2014 with the \u2014 used to come very discreetly. We had a special entrance for them. And they used to give all \u2014 all kind of information, you know. So, when I used to \u2014 I used to go to meet them from time to time, to visit them, they used to fill up my side, you know, from the motorcycle, like with all kind of meats, and everything, and they used to take that \u2014 there used to be Alexanderplatz(ph), which was a \u2014 a \u2014 a place, a very special place for black market, and \u2014 and for all kind of illegal activities, you know.

He used to give me something like a [indecipherable] and I was very, very happy, you know. And then, when I used to go with the gramophone factory, used to be loaded with gramophones, you know. They \u2014 the Germans, I mean they \u2014 they had a\u2014a very interesting thing, it\u2019s when they \u2014 when \u2014 when they capitulated, I  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  125 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 mean, that was it. They wouldn\u2019t get involved in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in terrorist or some other activities, that was it. In the meantime, I used to go with \u2014 with Colonel Baruck(ph). He \u2014 he was very friendly with the chief of police from \u2014 from Berlin, and they used to go hunting together, and I was with them, always. So one day, I \u2014 I became friendly also with the chief of police, and I told him I \u2014I say, I\u2019m involved in \u2014 in this type of activities where sometimes I have to go from one sector \u2014 now that Berlin is divided four sector; the French, the British, the Russian, and the \u2014 and the American. I says, and I am sometimes in jeopardy, so I need a \u2014 a ausweis \u2014 I \u2014 a card, as a German. He hesitated, but then he gave it to me, you know. And I say, don\u2019t mention it to anybody, because this is due to my work, you know. So, when I met with Helmut(ph) Selten(ph), and I disclosed him that I eventually want to \u2014 I have relatives in Cuba, and I\u2019d like to get out, because pretty soon they\u2019re going to demobilize me and send me back to Lithuania, which was \u2014 I didn\u2019t have any desire to go back to Lithuania. So we start actively pursuing, I mean, how to \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014 what to do, how to \u2014 so one day he comes for \u2014 to me, very happy, and he says, listen, I mean, there is a Joint \u2014 the Joint Distribution Center in \u2014 in West Berlin, in the American sector. Why don\u2019t we go over there? And I used to wear sometimes, civilian clothes also, because due to my work, I mean, I used to have to be camouflaged, you know, so I wore more civilian than \u2014 than military. So  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection  126 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 I say, okay, let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s move. So, we took the U-Bahn, you know, the metro? And we went to \u2014 I think it was in \u2014 in Charlottenburg. So, we came into the Joint Distribution, and there is a American colonel, and I say, look, I\u2019m a\u2014 a Russian and Jewish officer in the Russian army, and I would like to \u2014 you should help me to flee, and I \u2014 I have my relatives in Cuba, and I \u2014 I just would like to get away, because \u2014 I explained to him, I say, I\u2019m going to be very openly where you \u2014 open with you, I am truthfully \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 I \u2014 they \u2014 I have no use any more to be here. I mean, I have already accomplished what I felt to accomplish. Now I will \u2014 what I want is to \u2014 to \u2014 to get to my family, I mean, because I am by myself. They\u2019re going to send me back to \u2014 he said, look, we\u2019re sorry, but we cannot do anything, because we have a very good relationship with the Russian, they\u2019re our allies, and we cannot create a \u2014 a\u2014 a-\u2014a international conflict. I say, international [indecipherable]. So I almost [indecipherable] because I saw here that my \u2014 my opportunity to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to get out, and I thought, they\u2019re going to \u2014 like, I\u2019m going to declare myself like a \u2014 a\u2014a refugee, and then that\u2019s it. So he says \u2014 he calls on his secretary. He said, look, you know where your relatives are in Cuba, what\u2019s their name? And I say, yes, I have their name. Do you \u2014 do you know where they are? I say, no, they\u2019re in Havana. Do you have a address? I give to her address. So I say, why don\u2019t you send \u2014 we are going to send a telegram. We\u2019re going to send  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick m7 September 22, 1994 that to the Jewish community center in Havana, to make the story short. And I thought, I mean, this 1s a\u2014 I mean, he just wanted to get rid of me, and then he \u2014 he \u2014 he just [indecipherable]. Exactly 20 days later, Helmut(ph) calls me and says, hey. He says, I have a letter from Cuba for you. A month later, and I almost fainted, you know. I had my, in Yiddish [indecipherable] letter from my uncle, telling me that my other uncle, you know, that I left, and he was in the concentration camp in Buchenwald was liberated. His wife was liberated, and they tried to locate the daughter. And that my friend, this Prather(ph), that he was together with me in \u2014 in the \u2014 in the camps, and I helped him, is in Munich, and he\u2019s studying engineering, and they\u2019re going to get in touch with him to \u2014 he should help me escape. And pretty soon I received another letter, from Munich, from \u2014 and this letters wer \u2014 went to Helmut(ph) Selten(ph), not to me, of course, because I had to be very \u2014 very much \u2014 very much careful, because any \u2014 any step on the side, I would have been completely \u2014 I mean, they would send me to Siberia. Not even that, they would shoot me. There would be a court martial. So \u2014 can we interrupt for a minute?"

My uncle was the president at that time, from the community center. He was the one that brought most of the family, brought the other uncle, and everything.

And he  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 129 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 travels always with his wife and child, because that makes \u2014 doesn\u2019t gi \u2014 doesn\u2019t make him too \u2014 those \u2014 the people, and the guards to be suspicious.

So we arranged this. I went to the \u2014 I left him behind, I went to the bahnhof, to the train station, and there were a huge amount of people.

But Berlin by itself, found itself within the Russian occupational zone, which means  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick _ September 22, 1994 that in order to get out from Berlin is not to get out of Berlin, I had to get out from the whole zone, to cross through hundred \u2014 few hundred kilometers.

I figured we have a long voyage to a small town which is going the direction to Bremen, but Bremen is in the eng \u2014 in the British Zone of occupation.

There is going to be a \u2014 some type of guard is going to come in at some certain point to check the documenta \u2014 documents on the train. Because that was a normal procedure and I \u2014 I knew it\u2019s going to happen. I also \u2014 I thought to myself, it\u2019s going to come in a German guard, I\u2019m going to show them that I am a Russian and I traveled there to see some relatives. And I didn\u2019t have a  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick me September 22, 1994 problem because I \u2014 I had also this Baruck(ph), my colonel, was out of town.

That\u2019s my day, what shall I do? And I had to think quickly. I was next to the guy with the \u2014 with his wife, and we were chatting and \u2014 and here comes the guard, documents, documents, documents. I ventured to pull out my German rather than Russian, and I think I made the right decision, you know.

And they just only ask me where I travel, and I said \u2014 I knew right town and [indecipherable]. So why do you come [indecipherable]. And I said a few words in German, you know, and \u2014 and my worries were over. They came to the \u2014 almost to the border. We come off. Then he said to me, no, we have to go now. We have to walk now for about two  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  133 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 kilometers, because there is a place where I will always go through, but there is a very little where \u2014 sometimes even \u2014 they don't have even a guard on the border.

It\u2019s worth \u2014 it\u2019s worth 500 dollars, he say, that\u2019s \u2014 this is so beautiful. This \u2014 this is real \u2014 real elephant bone handle. I mean, that\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s worth a fortune. I said, you can have it. You need some marks? I told him, you have here marks also, because they are useless here.

So I gave it to him and then we went to \u2014 from there we went to Bremen. In Bremen, we slept in the \u2014 1n the railroad station. I red \u2014 I had my knapsack and my \u2014 my boots were my \u2014 my pillow. I was so happy. From there I had to go to Bergen-Belsen, which was in the vicinity, because there I had my contact. So I went to Bergen-Belsen, spend there a night. And then I found the man that\u2019s supposed to take me back to \u2014 take me to Munich. And then I came to Munich, my friend was ecstatic. He had a little, tiny-miney room, you know, big as my closet here. And he says, we can share it, I mean, you can stay here. And for the  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  135 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 first time, I had a good meal, you know. Fantastic, you know, say \u2014 with some American products, and some other thing. I forgot to mention to you that when we were in the \u2014 in Berlin, I had to mention to you something very important, that I \u2014 I overlooked something. Being in Berlin, we had a \u2014 I had a special mission. I don't know how many people are aware, but I-I don't think too many are aware of that. I\u2019m going to tell you that they \u2014 they have transplanted factories from Berlin to some \u2014 they \u2014 they used to take them to different parts of Russia. So I was assigned a mission with a truck with three soldiers to go to \u2014 they have \u2014 taking out the IG Farben company from Berlin, and they are supposed to be shipped to Leningrad to dismantle completely. Not only dismantle, what they have \u2014 our assignment was to take the workers, including even the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the lowest paid guy, like, the \u2014 the \u2014 the guy that cleans the factory. Everybody had to be placed on a train by five o\u2019clock in the morning. And we used to come with a truck and come to the house and knock on the door and say, out in five minutes. Sei haben five minuten. So you have five minutes to \u2014 to get your belongings and \u2014 and out on the car. This was such a pleasure, this task that I had. Of course, it was nothing compared to what they have done to me. But it was, I \u2014 I cer \u2014I found a certain \u2014 although, I didn\u2019t have anything against the \u2014 against the guys, those guys that worked there in the factory, no. Now, this \u2014 this factory, for a fact, they were so organized \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick _e September 22, 1994 the Russians were so organi \u2014 disorganized, that it took them X amount of months to reach the destiny for the factory. And then they found out that part of the factory went to one place, to Smolensk and the other one went to Leningrad. And tha-that was the what \u2014 what the \u2014 but if that \u2014 what th \u2014 I had to mention that, because that was a very, very unique experience, you know, whereby I \u2014 I was in charge of \u2014 of taking \u2014 I mean, to \u2014 disassembling and taking those people to the train station at five o\u2019clock, and \u2014 and it \u2014 1t was a\u2014 a remarkable \u2014 you know, sometimes you remember certain \u2014 certain \u2014 so okay, so wh-when I came \u2014 when I came to Munich, I \u2014 it happened to be those people that I used to send packages.

So I stayed couple days in Prather\u2019s home, and then he took me to Feldafing, because they are \u2014 they\u2019re relatives. And this lady, Fruma(ph) Lankavich(ph), she went out her way to accommodate me and to \u2014 and to \u2014 and to help me out. And what \u2014 what I wanted basically is to \u2014 to get \u2014 get out from Germany and go to \u2014 to Cuba. So there was \u2014 I asked her \u2014 from there, I wrote already freely, you know, to \u2014 to Cuba, and they \u2014 they send me some \u2014 they send me letters, and they send me also a letter saying that they have \u2014  http://collections.ushmm.org  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Abe Resnick aa September 22, 1994 they instituted a visa in \u2014 in \u2014 in fr \u2014 in Paris, to go to \u2014 I mean to \u2014 in order to come to Cuba. Now, how do you go to Paris? I don\u2019t have any \u2014 any \u2014 any documents. So I start working on documents. In the meantime, a guy came by and he said that he is \u2014 he\u2019s capable to \u2014 you know, we\u2019re very desperate, you know. The time was now important to \u2014 to get out. I mean, we just wanted to reach already a destiny, after so many pain and suffering. So we had \u2014 the guy said that for a hundred dollars, he is going to make me false papers to travel to France. So I \u2014 I found a\u2014 a-\u2014a friend of \u2014 of the family, with the name of Bernard Picard(ph), who also in Kovno ghetto. And he was a brigadier, the other brigade, Bernard Picard(ph). And he le \u2014 he lend me the \u2014 the hundred dollars. And I gave it to the guy and he made me this paper, it didn\u2019t look to me good, but I figured he \u2014 he \u2014 he knows what he\u2019s doing. But through the train, we went to Strasbourg, and through Saargebiet, you know. And when we came to France, the Saret\u00e9 came out, the French police took us off an-and \u2014 and sent \u2014 was going to send us back. And I\u2014 I got very, very scared so I took out certain things that I had from the Russians and I just flushed it down the toilet, you know. Because I figured maybe they are going to send me back to the [indecipherable] \u2014 you know, that time you were fearful, you didn\u2019t know. They might send you back to \u2014 to your destiny, where you \u2014 you were coming from. So then I came back to \u2014 to Feldafing, and we start working legally.

So then \u2014 then I was able to \u2014 I got \u2014 I got already the \u2014 the real papers went to France, and then there I had my visa. I spent in France a few days, and then I found out, in order to go to United States \u2014 to Cuba, I have to go through United States and I need a visa. This is eight months. You had to wait for eight months for \u2014 to get \u2014 to get a visa to United States. So I started \u2014 I had all \u2014 I found also a other guy that was going to Cuba, by the name \u2014 same name like me, Abraham, but his name was Rabinowitz(ph). And he told me, wherever you go, I go with you. I said, fine. So I start walking up and down in \u2014 in France, in Paris, and \u2014 and looking. I spoke a little English, you know, it was easier for me because he didn\u2019t. And I start looking. Finally, I found \u2014 we found a maiden flight of a six-motor hydroplane from Air France, that was going to Dakar, Africa, and Port-Etienne. And from there \u2014 and to \u2014 from Dakar to Port-Etienne. So we \u2014 what I did is, we had our tickets from Pan American.

Then we took the trip with this six-motor hid \u2014 hydroplane and it took us \u2014 it was an incredible flight, you know. They gave us champagne and we felt like kings already there.

And it was \u2014 we had few forts, but the Ninth Fort was the \u2014 was the one that\u2019s for \u2014 were the \u2014 that was best equipped to \u2014  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Abe Resnick m September 22, 1994 to kill and also to dispose of the bodies. But you see, there were so many \u2014 so many people were killed \u2014 or murdered, not killed \u2014 at the Ninth Fort, that they didn\u2019t have \u2014 didn\u2019t give them time to get rid of the bodies. So what they did is, they used to burn \u2014 they used to place them in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in rows, you know, one on top of the other one. But then, apparently towards at the end of 1943, there came a order from the Reichs command that it has to be something done in order to eliminate the bodies. So they were \u2014 they looked for a Sonderkommando, and they took a number of \u2014 of people and \u2014 of Jews from the \u2014 from \u2014 from the ghetto. And they had decided they had some other people, which they kept there for a long time. What they used to do with those people is, after they \u2014 after they did their \u2014 their dirty work, they used to kill them and then bring in some new people, you know, because they \u2014 they always tried to \u2014 to hide their tracks behind \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and the evidence behind them. So they brought in this contingency of the Sonderkommando, and they were there for some time, and they \u2014 they tried to \u2014 they exhumed the \u2014 the bodies and they tried to burn them. And the way they did \u2014 they used to do that, they used to lay them in \u2014 in layers and \u2014 and put in wood in between and then pour gas and then \u2014 and the, of course, in the concentration camps they used crematoriums, which were more \u2014 more advanced technology.

So what they plotted is, they found themselves that they \u2014 they have, New Year\u2019s Eve, they have some way got some additional \u2014 additional liquor for the guards and they \u2014 when they were drunk, they traced \u2014 they had a map of the ninth \u2014 of the Ninth Fort and they \u2014 some way they were able to escape and this was a escape like a large group of \u2014 of \u2014 of people was able to escape, you know.
