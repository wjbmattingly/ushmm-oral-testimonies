And there was, of course, radio, all what we had. And it was in the early stages. We didn't have, of course, TV or some other entertainment.

Also, about the Ottoman times in Turkey , which were also in some \u0152 or some years ago that Turkey, what \u0152 they had a very big influence on Palestine when they had \u0152 they were under Turkish occupation, by the Ottomans and [indecipherable] .

I remember I used to take the train. It would take forever, and it was only about 200 miles. I don\u2122t remember, kilometers or miles, but [indecipherable] . And then I used to join my family and I was very proud. People used to respect me very much for the fact that I am \u0152 I am \u0152 I am coming from my big city , or \u0152 my other friends were educated in our small city, most of them went to Lithuanian schools. And the relationship between Jews and Lithuanians was very, very cordial, you know, very nice, they were very friendly, and we had never had any \u0152 any big sense of Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 12 anti-Semitism. I mean, at least we didn\u2122t \u0152 didn\u2122t feel that. Sometimes, in sporadic cases, in \u0152 there were certain \u0152 certain acts of hostility, but very, very rare. And going back and forth, and so we reached the time when I was \u0152 reached eight. The last year was the eight class , you know, and this \u0152 this was the year when we \u0152 I was going to finish the gymnasium and, of course, after gymnasium, as \u0152 as you know, that a gymnasium is like a \u0152 translated in terms of here, American terms, it's like a partially college \u0152 high school and college, whereby we had to take also logaritmais and differentials and ma-many items that were many \u0152 such \u0152 many subjects that were being taken in the \u0152 in the \u0152 in \u0152 in wi \u0152 in the university. [indecipherable] My \u0152 I was \u0152 I took Latin because we had \u0152 we were able to take some foreign languages. I \u0152 I \u0152 I took \u0152 Russian, I spoke because when I was born my parents finished Russian schools before Lithuania was independent. So I \u0152 I spoke, when I \u0152 in the beginning I spoke Russian. And when I went to \u0152 to school, and to cheder, I start speaking Yiddish, and then, of course, Hebrew and then, of course, Lithuanian. And then I took German in \u0152 in school, I had to take. And then I took Latin because I \u0152 my \u0152 my interest was to become a doctor and my parents wanted to send me to Italy beca use the curriculum in \u0152 in Lithuania was very small. We had a university, not \u0152 not too big, and that was very difficult to get into the university. So some friends of ours went to Italy and my aim was also to go to Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 13 Italy after finishing gymnasium. And of course, 1939, this was still before \u0152 two years before I finished gymnasium, the \u0152 the Russians \u0152 I mean, the turmoil in Europe started. The Russians have decided with the Ribbentrop pact, you know, to divide between Germany and Russia . Russia was going to take over the Baltics; Lithuania , Latvia , and Estonia. And Germany was take part of Pola nd , and \u0152 and of course, Czechoslovakia and Austria, so forth and so on. So it started already, the feeling we \u0152 we felt that there is something \u0152 something happening, but we have never \u0152 we were confident that our government is \u0152 which was a democratic co untry with a president, a parliament, and with quite a lot of liberty and freedom. But in 1939, we have \u0152 we found out one day that we are under the Russian \u0152 the Russian \u0152 that the Russians have absorbed the three Baltic states and we \u0152 we have heard \u0152 I mean, the \u0152 that like a day or two days ahead of time that the Russian tanks are going to be coming into Kovno , to Lithuania . Of course, there was no resistance because compared to Russia , we had a small miniature army and there was no way that we were able to fight Russia at that time. And \u0152 and the Russians took \u0152 I remember when they \u0152 when they marched into Lithuania . And righ t away when they marched in \u0152 you see, our gymnasium was a Hebrew gymnasium. So when the Russians came in, they changed their \u0152 right away they eliminate \u0152"

These became taboo. That is a very offensive in the Russian \u0152 in the Soviet system, to belong to organizations which are not within their framework. They \u0152 right away, they expelled all the teachers, all the Hebrew teachers, and suddenly we became, rather than a Hebrew school, we became a Yiddish school. Yiddish for them was like the \u0152 main language, truthfully, was Yiddish, but Hebrew for them, was \u0152 they had certain suspicions that Hebrew is a little bit too closer to the \u0152 they considered those who spoke Hebrew like fascists, in a certain way. So, it was not easy to get transformed \u0152 to change sudsuddenly, and \u0152 and \u0152 and especially for us kids, you know, it was \u0152 although everybody spoke Yiddish, but the \u0152 the \u0152 the reason why I was sent to this gymnasium was not \u0152 because home we spoke Yiddish, was to learn, and to \u0152 to get acquainted with \u0152 with Hebrew, and not with Yiddish.

Now, in meantime, time was going on and the happenings in Europe were very traumatic, and \u0152 and very drastic. Czechoslovakia fell. We suddenly had an influx of checs \u0152 Czechoslovakian \u0152 Czechoslovakian re fugees . Some of them \u0152 many of them Jewish, who came \u0152 and they came actually to Roki\u0131kis, not to Kaunas . They were afraid to go to the large cities, cause they were afraid to be interned, and then sent back to \u0152 to Czechoslovakia . And they start telling u s about \u0152 first of all, it was very hard for us to \u0152 to bring them in, because they \u0152 they were \u0152 they came in illegally. But we provided them \u0152 first of all, we took them to a synagogue, and we made them comfortable there, and there, little by little, we spread them out to different family houses. And they start telling us about the horrors, about what Hitler is doing to the Jewish population, and especially in Czechoslovakia . And most of those people who came, were very intelligent people, like one of them was a \u0152 I remember very vividly, one was a painter, and his paintings was fantastic. I remember even that he helped me to paint some \u0152 I had to make the \u0152 to make a thesis about certain \u0152 certain things in \u0152 in school, and he helped me to, with a \u0152 with a \u0152 with the Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 20 paintings, whereby he \u0152 he was actually a perfect painter, you know, that. The other one, I remember the name, one was Foyer (ph) Opataker (ph), the other one was a businessman who lost his business, and he a \u0152 was able to escape, just by himself. He was not able even to bring his family. They \u0152 then we had also influx from \u0152 from Polish refugees, who came \u0152 especially Polish military people, who interned themselves. But this \u0152 they \u0152 they came in actually legally \u0152 not I \u0152 they \u0152 I mean they \u0152 they crossed the border, and then they surrendered. So, of course their arms were taken away, and \u0152 and they were placed in a \u0152 in \u0152 I remember in a \u0152 in the center of the city, that was in Roki\u0131kis . And I remember seeing them with their \u0152 where they took \u0152 care more on \u0152 they were more concerned about their boots and their uniforms than about some other \u0152 other things, you know."

There was one pilot, and then they joined the other one. And we had to give up one of the rooms, and they \u0152 and they were there together with us. And I finished the gymnasium, we got ready to go back home, but for some reason, the certificates of completion were not made available. So I felt rather than to go back home, and I \u0152 I was very proud that I finish without any \u0152 any problems \u0152 I was not one of the best teacher \u0152 students, but I \u0152 I did my homework, and I \u0152 I never failed from one year to the other one.

So this was in the middle of June. And they told me that the certificates are going to be finished by June \u0152 by the later part of June, and I felt I\u2122m going to stay for a few more days. You know, school has Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 22 finished. The summer was there, and it was nice, and we got a little bit more used to the \u0152 to the \u0152 to our new system, and came June 21 st, nighttime, and suddenly we had a \u0152 we heard a \u0152 some movement in the \u0152 in the room, from the two pilots that we had. And they suddenly, middle of the night, they run out, without saying anything. They disappeared. And a little while later we heard bombings, we heard planes. And we put on the radio, and this was the invasion of the second \u0152 actually the \u0152 the Nazi part of the second World War started. Whereby that Hitler didn\u2122t announce, without announcing, he just \u0152 he starts \u0152 start the invasion.

Everybody was living with the dreams that they had this Ribbentrop pact, it was Molotov , and \u0152 and that both parts were satisfied that there is no \u0152 we \u0152 we leaned more to the fact that we thought that he is going to \u0152 if he is going to attack, he is going to go against England , rather than \u0152 than \u0152 it was a \u0152 a incredible surprise. So, right away it \u0152 I remember my house, we \u0152 we \u0152 we didn\u2122t know what to do. We had also a other tenant, which I didn\u2122t mention before, that was \u0152 yeah?

They bombed \u0152 basically, wh en they started bombing, they bombed the airport, and then certain military objectives. And the \u0152 the whole city became a \u0152 a \u0152 a turmoil. And we also heard about, through the radio, they start announcing that Germany has attacked the Soviet Union , and wir \u0152 that \u0152 the Lithuanians are \u0152 this was still with the Russians there, that the Lithuanians are very much in \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 in favor of \u0152 of reading and \u0152 and receiving the \u0152 the victorious \u0152 the victorious German troops.

I got my bicycle, and \u0152 and when I came to a certain point, I saw people coming towards us and said, return, because there is atrocities on the highway. They \u0152 they fly low, the German airplanes, and they \u0152 and they just kill everybody that is on there, on the highways. From time to time you have to run off and \u0152 and throw yourself on \u0152 on the ground, because the \u0152 the massacres are just incredible, especially in \u0152 because, you see the civilians, and the \u0152 and the \u0152 the Russians were also \u0152 they were mixed. They were running together. Many Russian trucks, they \u0152 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 24 right away they \u0152 they \u0152 they start abandoning their military supplies, an d military barracks, and \u0152 and they \u0152 they just try to move eastward, you know, towards \u0152 towards Russia . And this was so dramatic, and we \u0152 we \u0152 we didn\u2122t know. We had some relatives on the \u0152 we had a \u0152 that was called a \u0152 the klininbar (ph), that\u2122s the \u0152 the green \u0152 the Green Mountain. That was a \u0152 a place within \u0152 within Kovno where we had some relatives who \u0152 who \u0152 from my aunt\u2122s part, who lived there. We felt maybe to go to them, there in that place maybe would be safer. So we went up there, and then we came back to our \u0152 to our apartment, feel the safest place is to stay in the apartment. Killings started, and especially Lithuanians, where they were very bo \u0152 very much against \u0152 against the Soviets. They hated the Soviets, you know, from the beginning. So \u0152 and they considered that there are some Jewish people were in the communists, and \u0152 and they \u0152 right away they wanted to take vengeance, you know, and what they did is, they right away start killing people, start torturing them, start \u0152 there was a s \u0152 a special \u0152 a special torture chamber, which was made to a \u0152 to a torture chamber, which was made in a \u0152 one of their gas stations. They brought in about 20 people, and they put hoses in their mouth, and they \u0152 and they start water pressuring. And they just killed them with the \u0152 with that. I mean, there were so \u0152 such atrocity that beyond \u0152 beyond description. And the Germans were not in yet. The ger \u0152 Germans were still \u0152 they \u0152 they \u0152 you see, Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 25 the Germans, they had their tactics of the surrounding in a ring, and then closing up in the ring, an-and \u0152 and coming to the \u0152 to the \u0152 to the focal point where they were going to occupy. The \u0152 for the Russians it was a incredible shock what happened, and they \u0152 they were really not prepared and not ready for the oncoming victorious German troops. There were also announcements in the radio two days later, where it said that \u0152 it was in Lithuanian, in Russian, and in German, what said that \u0152 but basically highlighting in Lithuanian. The victorious German troops are coming, are close to Kovno , they are going to enter Kovno in \u0152 in the next hours, and we have noticed that some snipers, and some communists, and some Jews have \u0152 are resisting, and shooting against them. So we want to mention that for each German soldier that is going to be killed \u0152 that\u2122s going to be killed \u0152 hundred Jews or communists are going to be taken and shot, without \u0152 without any \u0152 any question. And this was constantly, and \u0152 and constantly in the radio. So we \u0152 we felt already, we knew what \u0152 what \u0152 what\u2122s coming and \u0152 and we didn\u2122t realize that we felt, maybe after Kovno is going to be taken over by the Germans, maybe they are going to establish their \u0152 their rules, and they are going to be more human than \u0152 than the Lithuanians, but this was not the case, and they occupied Kovno . Then suddenly, every day they used to make \u0152 promulgate a \u0152 a new decree. One decree, the first one was that all Jews have to bring into the kommandantur any arms, if they had Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 26 any \u0152 any \u0152 any radios. Any watches. Anything, right away. Then there came a second decree, that the Jews cannot walk on the sidewalk, they have to walk on the \u0152 on the \u0152 on the street side. Third decree was that you have to give up all your \u0152 all \u0152 all the valuables. If you have some jewelry, som e \u0152 some \u0152 any kind, any type of jewelry, stamps \u0152 I had a big collection of stamps, myself.

This is where they decided, because they were originally a Jewish population, and those Lithuanians who were living there, have to give up their houses, and they were going to be resettled in some other houses, which were left by \u0152 by \u0152 by the Jews. I mean, that was like quid pro quo \u0152 pro quo, you know, they exchange. So right away we started looking for a \u0152 for a place, and there was also on first come, first move in basis.

They \u0152 they start killing, raping, an-and taking away all kind of \u0152 all kind of items that belonged to \u0152 to the Jewish people, you know, when they \u0152 when \u0152 every time we moved, when we moved to the \u0152 to the Green Mountain, we were going to my aunt\u2122s brother\u2122s house. He had there a little farm, and we felt we\u2122re going to go over there, and we\u2122re going to be able to have some food, because he had \u0152 the farm still belonged to him. So, when we went there, there were \u0152 nighttime came in, and a group of like three or four people with their guns, and they started taking away everything, whatever we \u0152 and \u0152 and my uncle stood up for them, so they hit him with their \u0152 with their \u0152 with their rifle butt, you know."

They \u0152 they were in, but they mind their own business, and they let Lithuanians to enjoy themselves, doing what they did. And it was \u0152 was terrible things they have done. They have taken people to their \u0152 to their \u0152 to \u0152 to a prison. And there was also a teacher of my \u0152 I remember [indecipherable] Goldman (ph), a familiar name. He Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 32 was our English teacher. He was himself from South Africa . And he was a compulsive smoker, so the \u0152 they wouldn\u2122t give him any \u0152 anything to smoke, so he used to get the small ration of \u0152 of bread, he used to exchange that for \u0152 for cigarettes. And he finally succumbed, he died, you know, because he \u0152 he just \u0152 his body wouldn\u2122t \u0152 wouldn\u2122t resist it. But beside the beatings, and the \u0152 and the \u0152 and the \u0152 the \u0152 the terror that they \u0152 they have implanted him in was \u0152 it was just terrible.

For some reason, I mean, he emerged in \u0152 in water, and got stuck there. They caught about 20 people, they put them like \u0152 like \u0152 like horses, you know, to pull out a t \u0152 how can 20 people pull out a tank, which is who knows how many tons is the weight of the tank, and they just hit \u0152 hit the people, hit the people, til mo -most of them were blooded, and \u0152 and \u0152 and were \u0152 were fainted, you know, in the \u0152 that \u0152 that was the \u0152 that was the situation.

And then the \u0152 my uncle was very smart, he actually took the \u0152 I mean, he took the position to sit in-inside the apartment, then we have to [indecipherable] to sit inside.

And the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the manag er of this place, because it was mostly offices, and the manager of the place was very, very nice Lithuanian guy, you know, exceptional.

I mean, it\u2122s \u0152 the \u0152 we \u0152 I had myself, have \u0152 have seen people beaten and \u0152 and \u0152 and hurt, and especially what happened in with this \u0152 with this horses, you know. This was a \u0152 we \u0152 we have a \u0152 we \u0152 we have seen not exactly what happened there, but we have seen the \u0152 well, the way they took in the people, and \u0152 and we \u0152 we know for a fact, I mean, I \u0152 there were also pictures Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 36 about it. But they \u0152 they have \u0152 there were a few thousand people who were \u0152 who were documented as \u0152 as killed in the first \u0152 in the first few days. And these were people that \u0152 that they s \u0152 not only they run to the highway, but people who were just systematically taken out from their houses. They went with their list, apparently they had a list of \u0152 of addresses, would take them out and then just \u0152 not \u0152 it \u0152 it wa \u0152 shooting was not th-the \u0152 the great part, but \u0152 but to torture, all kind of ways of torturing, you know, like chopping off a arm, a-and especially also with children. That was terrible, and all, but what they have done with \u0152 with children, like smashing them against the wall, or \u0152 and most of the time they were drunk, you know. Because for one thing is the Lithuanians knew \u0152 I mean, they were very educated in \u0152 in drinking. They used to mad e \u0152 make a lot of homemake \u0152 homemade vodka. It was called samagonda (ph), it was made from potatoes. And this was, like in the times of prohibition, you know, th-this \u0152 this was \u0152 you know, due to the fact of the climate, that we have a cold climate, there are very many, many drunks on the \u0152 on the streets. There were always many drunks, and \u0152 and \u0152 and this drinking didn\u2122t help the situation in the beginning, because they had that available, they \u0152 they took over some places where there were all kinds of \u0152 of liquor, an-and \u0152 and wine, and \u0152 and they \u0152 they would empty this out, and th \u0152 ththis \u0152 this was also something that they had in common with the Russians, who Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 37 were also very good in that, you know, in drinking. So th-that \u0152 they had the first \u0152 the first few days there were numerous amounts of \u0152 of people that were \u0152 they were counted possibly in the couple thousands of them, yeah."

And there was something else. Something else I have to mention is that right after \u0152 after we were \u0152 after the Germans came in, they came about 15 \u0152 two weeks afterwards, we had to start using the yellow stars.

There were some \u0152 some cases of resistance. There was a case of a schoolmate of mine, his name was Discant (ph), that he dressed himself as a \u0152 as a German officer, and \u0152 [interruption , break] He \u0152 he \u0152 there were formed, small groups of resistance, really in \u0152 were in the forming. They were a little older than myself, they were a little more mature. Those who \u0152 who started \u0152 who started organizing. And there was a friend of mine, already a friend that we used to \u0152 he used to come to my house, and we used to \u0152 to not only go to school together, but to have some and certain things in common, you know. So he \u0152 he was dressed as a \u0152 dressed a German officer, and they \u0152 they were supposed to escape to the forest, you know, to pro at \u0152 I mean, to institute their resistance. And apparently the guy, Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 39 the chauffeur that\u2122s supposed to take them, betrayed them. And then \u0152 and that was already not the Lithuanians, but the Germans caught them, and they took them to the Gestapo and they shot them, all of the, you know, there were like 14 people and one of \u0152 he was one of those. So there were start \u0152 and the question is, why didn\u2122t you have resistance. Because the Russian army that was there, and they had their \u0152 their \u0152 their arms, and they were not resisting, because they saw the handwriting on the wall, they saw what actually happened, they saw the might. And when the \u0152 I remember the day the Germans came in, and I looked through the window. My uncle used to pull me back, I shouldn\u2122t look through the window, because anany momen t, I mean, somebody can shot \u0152 shoot you, you know. Tha \u0152 when they came in, and they \u0152 and they paraded in the street, they came in clean, with their boots shining, you could \u0152 like mirrors, you know, and with loudspeakers. Ahead of them were Lithuanians who were pronouncing that the victorious German army is coming in, that they \u0152 this is only a \u0152 are going to be established here. But the army is going to move on, and \u0152 and finish with the \u0152 with the \u0152 with the Soviets, and it\u2122s a matter only of a short time. They expect to do that within the summer. That was \u0152 that was June. So they figured, June, July, August, September, October gets ready. So they \u0152 they thought their \u0152 they were projecting to occupy the Soviet Union about four or four months, you know, which they \u0152 Napoleon was not able to do Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 40 that also, you know. He had the same \u0152 the same pattern. But resisting, I \u0152 it \u0152 it \u0152 it was \u0152 everybody was on the shock, you know. And \u0152 and normally, we people were not ready for \u0152 for resisting. We have never had an-anything, any training in \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 in arms. When I know that later on, I\u2122m going to tell you that \u0152 which I hi \u0152 will tell you now, that I used to, in many cases I used to take off my \u0152 my stars, and \u0152 and then used to go out and I was blondish, I didn\u2122t look too much as \u0152 well, non Jewish, and I used to go out and \u0152 and trade certain things in order to get \u0152 to get some food, because their f \u0152 the food situation became very critical , very critical. As soon they took us into the ghetto, they \u0152 they started in \u0152 they started taking brigades, they were called brigades. When a brigadier creates \u0152 they instituted a \u0152 a police, a Jewish police was in the ghetto, and then they instituted also the \u0152 a Jewish council. So, first of all they were \u0152 had to repair to fix the airports. So everybody was compelled to go out in the morning, five o\u2122clock in the morning had to be in the reunion place, and then they used to come and \u0152 with guards, and \u0152 and walk to the \u0152 to the airport. So I remember they used to give us 200 grams of bread, and I used to put it in the pocket, an-and by the time I came to the \u0152 to the airport, and when they used to give us some soup, which was made of water, and well, with some \u0152 some vegetables, some kind of this [indecipherable] vegetables, you know. And they used to boil that, and by that time I didn\u2122t have really bread, because walking, I Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 41 \u0152 I used to chew off on the portion of bread. So the situation of \u0152 the food situation became very \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the duration was very, very bigger. And we \u0152 we had to trade sometimes, certain objects with the \u0152 with Lithuanians. So, in the beginning, they used to let the \u0152 we were able to do that, but there were some \u0152 some people who didn\u2122t have a heart, from the Lithuanian side, you know. For instance, used to trade a \u0152 a \u0152 a suit for a \u0152 for a kilo of butter. So after you \u0152 you have to do that fast, you know, because they \u0152 you had to do that when the guard was with his back to \u0152 to you, you know. So, in the desperation you found out sometimes that instead of butter, what you had is a big stone, on that \u0152 I mean, with \u0152 with a \u0152 with a little bit \u0152 with a little bit of butter on \u0152 on the sides, you know. And it was disaster, and you \u0152 you were unable to do anything, you know, that\u2122s \u0152 those people who were free had all the rights. We were \u0152 we \u0152 we lost [indecipherable] lost, we were inhunamen \u0152 I mean, not \u0152 not considered human. They \u0152 although they didn\u2122t tattoo us with \u0152 with \u0152 on the beginning [indecipherable] afterwards in \u0152 when they took to the concentration camp. So life was \u0152 was terrible, especially in the beginning, it \u0152 it-it was very hard to \u0152 to get the \u0152 get used to and accommodate it, but \u0152 but there was no \u0152 no choice.

This was \u0152 you take from the Lithuanians, you had Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 43 like 50 percent for the people were illiterate, you know, especially those who lived on the farms, they \u0152 they \u0152 they didn\u2122t know how to read or write. They used to put a cross for \u0152 when they had to sign something, you know.

But amazingly \u0152 amaz ingly that in the ghetto, we were like 30 some thousand people, were pushed into this couple square kilometers in very inhuman conditions. But th-the \u0152 the ghetto life right away \u0152 I mean, we right away organized ourselves. We had like \u0152 we had a \u0152 a \u0152 a e l-elder\u2122s [indecipherable] which was a council, with a head of the council, which was a prominent \u0152 a prominent doctor. For many years, a Lithuanian \u0152 he was a M.D., and he \u0152 he was considered one of the top doctors in Lithuania , Dr. Elkes . And he was very strict, very \u0152 in the beginning he didn\u2122t want to take the job, but the \u0152 the other people from the \u0152 I mean, the head people from the ghetto came to him, and they pleaded with him that he should \u0152 he should there \u0152 they need him, because first of all, his perfect German, and his perfect Lithuanian, and perfect Russian, and he was already educated , very cultured person. And beside that, the respect that even those \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the captors had for \u0152 for him, in a certain way, his known \u0152 his name was very, very prominent. So they felt with this respect hi m \u0152 the Germans expressed very big respect for him, although they compelled this council to do their dirty work in \u0152 in many cases. But many of those who belonged to the council, and then the council instituted a ghetto police. And we had like over a hundred police officers. Their whole uniform was only a \u0152 a hat, and a armband what say, Jewish police. Plus the fact they had to use also the \u0152 the stars, the same Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 45 like everybody else. But these police was very instrumental in \u0152 in many cases, in many \u0152 after we were already established in the ghetto, we had a \u0152 most of the people had already a regular \u0152 I mean, some regular job, work, you know, the job was because \u0152 nobody paid for the job. They hardly gave you sufficient food to \u0152 for your sustenance, you know. But when \u0152 when \u0152 for instance, myself, I worked in the beginning in the flugplatz , that\u2122s an airport. And not only worked, I put in extra time, I was \u0152"

            "question": "Speaking of airports.",
            "answer": "Yeah. It\u2122s especially \u0152 you know, it\u2122s strange, you know, you \u0152 you \u0152 when you go back to your country, you go back to the city, which looked when you were very \u0152 when you were small, I mean, it looked to you that it\u2122s a fantastic city, because you didn\u2122t know better, you know. When you go back and you see, and \u0152 and \u0152 and you walk this same distance that you used to walk on the garden before, it seems to you so small, and so insignificant, you know, it\u2122s a \u0152 it\u2122s pathetic, you know? So I remember we used to walk on \u0152 under guard, with loaded rifles like \u0152 like supercriminals and all the \u0152 although there were no cases \u0152 very few cases of resistance within the \u0152 within the ghetto, within the \u0152 the \u0152 the establishment. And you \u0152 you call \u0152 you do your work, and you come back after a day\u2122s work, whereby you have guards there, and they constantly changed. In the beginning they had the Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 46 German guards, but then they start to bringing in the \u0152 the [indecipherable] the Russian Ukrainians, and then brought in Hungarians. And believe me, these guards, they were incompassionate . They used to beat you up every time you \u0152 you \u0152 you had to \u0152 to work, I mean without \u0152 almost without food, but constantly, and under supervision, and within the cold weather, t hey \u0152 they used to put a \u0152 a some a \u0152 a side fire in our work. From time to time you would come and \u0152 and warm up your hands, you know, you had the mittens, or the \u0152 but that do \u0152 didn\u2122t mean anything now, because if your body doesn\u2122t have fuel, I mean, you \u0152 you are \u0152 you still cold \u0152 it gets colder than in normal, when you have food. And they used to have special \u0152 special woods \u0152 wood sticks, which they would beat you up, you know, ev -every time, and without \u0152 without mercy. And every time you used to go to warm up, you stayed a little bit longer than what you supposed to, you know, which was prohibited to do that in the beginning, but you would do it \u0152 come out, because when the \u0152 and so my uncle was \u0152 he was a sick man, you know, he \u0152 so I used to work for him, I \u0152 sh \u0152 becau se there were a few shifts, there was like a 24 hour day, around the clock, to work at the airport, because they want to re-re-reestablish the airport, and \u0152 in order to be able to use that for their \u0152 for their own \u0152 for their own use, for their \u0152 and life was \u0152 was terrible. Of course, it \u0152 it gradually was in \u0152 in changing. In the beginning it was a ghetto. Then after \u0152 after a while it became a Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 47 concentration camp, and we have received the \u0152 before we were under the Wehrmacht , under the military. Then we \u0152 we came under the jurisdiction of the Obersturmf\u00fchrer Gecker (ph), and that was the SS. It\u2122s funny now this calls the \u0152 the [indecipherable] . So the SS , they were \u0152 they were terrible. They \u0152 they were still much worse than the Wehrmacht , because the Wehrmacht you found sometimes between the same guards, who were schoolteachers, who were, you know, they\u2122re \u0152 they were \u0152 they were called to \u0152 to duty. But there were still certain aspects of \u0152 of humanity, at one point, you know. But this \u0152 this [indecipher able] came in, and then they declared that as a concentration camp. So we came \u0152 we became a \u0152 a \u0152 a \u0152 in a different status, whereby this was right after \u0152 after the big aktia(ph) , which was October 20 th \u0152 28th, 1941, is when they \u0152 when they came in with loudspeakers and they announced that next morning, five o\u2122clock in the morning, after we have in a \u0152 in a special \u0152 a special large place, that everybody has to be out. Nobody can stay in the house. Not even the sick people can stay in the house. Everybody has to be out. If they find somebody inside, they will shoot him. So, next morning, everybody came out, and the \u0152 took some food, and they \u0152 they said that you take \u0152 if you had some food, take with you, because you\u2122re not going to be provided with any \u0152 any food. So everybody came out, and suddenly a few German trucks came in, and it was \u0152 with guards, and they \u0152 they Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 48 surrounded the place, and then the \u0152 the head of the Gestapo that time was a guy by the name of Rauca. Joseph , I think was his name, Rauca , and was a big German, a heavyset guy, and they came with dogs, and they started \u0152 they started \u0152 first of all, they searched houses, spot searched, whatever they can find somebody. And they as -assured themselves nobody there. They start pulling people to the left and to the right. Well, right away we saw that the people that they pulled to the left are mostly children, elderly people, people who are \u0152 have some blemish, or have some \u0152 some \u0152 some kind of paleness, or some kind of defect, you know. And I remember I had a little coat, you know, was a \u0152 was a fur \u0152 you know, the \u0152 the collar. So \u0152 and it was a cold \u0152 a cold [indecipherable] was October, it was already winter, basically in the \u0152 almost snow was \u0152 we were going to see. There were signs that snow was going to fall there. So then, I had my \u0152 my grandmother was with me, and I knew that they are going to call her. So, it was like instinctively, you know, when they pull her away. And when the German turned around, I pulled her back, and I was able to save her, you know, right, yeah, she was still with us for a couple more years afterward. But then they \u0152 they took out all those people, and they took them away. And that was a whole day operation, and we came home. Of course, we understood that they are taking them to a certain special assignment. I would like also to mention that the \u0152 the 500 intelligentsia, the people that they took out right \u0152 right Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 49 after the ghetto was closed, we found out in the next few days, that those was the first 500 people that they took to the , and they shot them all. Because their aim and their interest was to \u0152 to get rid of the \u0152 of \u0152 of more intelligent people, or people who are \u0152 who can plan, and who were \u0152 who had certain \u0152 certain qualifications, you know, that they wanted to \u0152 to get rid of them right away. And \u0152 and then there \u0152 there were \u0152 they were in a certain way right, and they were, in a certain way they have accomplished their \u0152 their \u0152 their doing. Now this time \u0152 that was 500. Now this time, on October 28 th, they took them also to the Ninth Fort , and they also shot them, and there were 10,000 of them. They \u0152 they had \u0152 they were more ready for these 10,000 than for the 500, because they already had excavated. They had \u0152 they had a brigade that they took ahead of time, and they didn\u2122t know what \u0152 that was a \u0152 a small aktion , which they took about a few dozen people. And their \u0152 their job was to excavate in the vicinity of the Ninth Fort . And fort was large, you know, those forts were established by the Russi ans, and they were specially kept for \u0152 for protection of the city. You see, Kovno was surrounded by the Third Fort , the Seventh Fort , the Ninth Fort . There were like four forts. And they were done by the \u0152 still by the \u0152 by the Russians. They were at high \u0152 at high levels, and \u0152 and they were \u0152 had a \u0152 places for \u0152 for \u0152 for soldiers, and \u0152 and \u0152 and of course they had places for Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 50 inmates. So they \u0152 those were the 10,000 that were \u0152 they \u0152 they liquida \u0152 so they actually cut by one-third, right away, the ghetto. This was also in conjunction with the burning, and with the \u0152 of the small ghetto. You see, when the ghetto was instituted, they had the large ghetto, and they had the small ghetto. What was the difference? The difference was that one main thoroughfare, one main road, run through the \u0152 through the ghetto, between the small and the large. And what they did is \u0152 what they \u0152 what they did is they instituted a \u0152 they built a bridge from the large ghetto to the small ghetto, which was also surrounded with wires, and that was always under military supervision. So the \u0152 the beginning, and this \u0152 in the small ghetto they had a hospital. There was a hospital that they converted, they have arranged for that, and they had a hospital with very, very \u0152 we had quite a number of doctors, and had quite a number of \u0152 of \u0152 of patients, people who were ill, who were sick, who were \u0152 who were old, who needed \u0152 who needed care, and there were also some women who were pregnant, you know. So this hospital was full to capacity . And one day what they decided is that \u0152 that they felt that \u0152 apparently that they don\u2122t need a hospital, and they don\u2122t need no sick people. So what they did is they surrounded the hospital, they surrounded that with haystack around. They poured gas. They nailed the doors in the hospital, and they burned \u0152 everybody was burned there, including the doctors, including the nurses, including the \u0152 including Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 51 the \u0152 including the pregnant women, including the \u0152 there was such a terrible \u0152 I mean, the \u0152 the \u0152 yo u \u0152 you could smell the \u0152 the \u0152 the stench, you know, the \u0152 the people. And right after that they had the \u0152 the big aktia (ph), and then they \u0152 they eliminated completely \u0152 this small ghetto was completely, those few people who still were there were evacuated, were passed to the \u0152 to the \u0152 to the bigger ghetto, because it became more room available by \u0152 by eliminating 10,000 people, it was too much room, you know, basically, based \u0152 based on they \u0152 on their standard. But this was a terrible, terrible, terrible act of aggression, you know, the \u0152 this \u0152 this was \u0152 in human history you find these cases only in times of the Romans, you know, that\u2122s \u0152 which also they had more compassion, you know, for certain \u0152 for \u0152 like for children, for \u0152 for \u0152 for \u0152 for babies, and then old people and so on."

            "answer": "I have to mention that also, that \u0152 can I go on? Also being in the ghetto was very traumatic, but the chairmans from ti me to time, they called up Dr. Elkes and they said, we need hundred people for a special assignment. Nobody knew whether this assignment is for real or whether it is to take out and to shoot people, but there were some r eal assignments. So I remember the Arbeitsamt , which was the place where the \u0152 where the council was, and it was a special building assigned \u0152 it was also a place that had also a jail. Because within the ghetto, there were sometimes found some people who are \u0152 who stole and who did certain acts of \u0152 which was not permitted, you know. So I remember that when the police head in \u0152 in the Arbeitsamt , the \u0152 the council , they had a \u0152 a very difficult task, whom to take out? I mean, the chairmans told them we need hundred people. I mean, there were also certain favoritism, which has to \u0152 I me an, happens from time to time, you know, because if you have a \u0152 if you are a police officer and you have a relat \u0152 a relat ive that they want him out, I mean, you would \u0152 you would try to protect him rather than somebody you don\u2122t know. So in many cases, it was a very, very difficult job for the \u0152 for the \u0152 for the elderat (ph), for the \u0152 for the council to take. What they opted to do is, most of the time, is people who didn\u2122t have families, people who \u0152 who didn\u2122t have \u0152 who were not rooted for, for some reason, whom they had some Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 53 grievances or some problems with them, problematic, you know.

I mean, it was a constant game, you know, and especially when \u0152 when the \u0152 when the Gestapo used to appear and come into \u0152 to the ghetto. I mean, it was very traumatic. I have also to mention to you is about were \u0152 because it came to my mind about Rauca . I had a personal \u0152 after I finished at the airport, I got myself a good brigade. Mine was good because I worked in a \u0152 for some reason they \u0152 they formed a new one and I was at the right time at the right place. They formed a brigade in a marmalade factory \u0152 and this was fa ntastic, you know \u0152 which had like \u0152 our brigadier was a guy by the name of Motts(ph), who survived incidentally the ghetto [indecipherable] later in Italy. And I was very friendly with \u0152 with him and I was able to stick to this brigade after \u0152 es pecially after the flugplatz , this was like a \u0152 a new life. Brigade was \u0152 we had to \u0152 that was a \u0152 a factory of marmalade and right next to that was also a place where they used to produce sauerkraut and sour pickles \u0152 pickled \u0152 pickled, you know, cucumbers. And at least you had \u0152 you were able to \u0152 to \u0152 to get some food, you know, because sauer kraut and pickles and marmalade, it's already a meal. And plus the fact marmalade is made with sugar and Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 54 sugar is very heavy. I remember they \u0152 they used to \u0152 I was compelled \u0152 I was pretty strong, you know, and I was compelled to \u0152 to take up bags of hundred kilo sugar \u0152 which is 225 pounds \u0152 to the third floor, where the \u0152 where they had the mixing of the \u0152 of the marmalade. And sometimes what I used to do is, I used to punch a hole in the bag and I had a \u0152 this \u0152 this coat that you see on this \u0152 on this picture, on this one. My grandmother had made, like a \u0152 a double \u0152 a double-deck, you know \u0152 a double \u0152 I mean, of the \u0152 the lower part. And \u0152"

There\u2122s a very remarkable something that I have to bring it up because there are certain aspects of me being in the \u0152 in the camps that \u0152 that I have to Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 58 highlight. And one of them is that this incredible experience that I had. And namely, they start bringing, to the railroad station, echelons \u0152 boxcars with the Jews from Austria and Germany . They called that, we found out later, the Hebrew siedlung . Hebrew siedlung basically means, place from one \u0152 take them from one place and put them to other plac e, in German. And these train came with cars loaded with pianos, with furniture, with all kinds of luxury items, to make believe to those people, when they \u0152 because you see, when they took out from Germany or from Austria, Jews to send them to \u0152 to their \u0152 to their massacre, to their \u0152 I mean, to their \u0152 to their graves, to their killings, was \u0152 apparently, they had a certain \u0152 a certain \u0152 had to handle it in a certain way. They tried to convince them that they are being taken to other place, just only to \u0152 they have to take them to \u0152 to \u0152 to other places. So when they came \u0152 and at that time, I was working for the Gestapo brigade. There was a special brigade which was the Gestapo brigade and many people have tried very hard to work in this brigade, because this brigade was always connected with certain \u0152 certain things that had to do with food. And there was many possibilities to \u0152 to fill up your stomach, you know, to be \u0152 to \u0152 not to be hungry. And this time they needed additional \u0152 additional people. So apparently, they took me and they took a \u0152 a group of other people to that task. And I \u0152 and I saw the way this echelons came, and I saw that they came in \u0152 in like, in plush Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 59 trains. It was not the \u0152 the \u0152 s ome \u0152 some boxcars came also at the same time, but they came for a \u0152 for \u0152 for a purpose of \u0152 of baggage and \u0152 and some other things. But these trains came with \u0152 and the people with their jewelry, with everything, and \u0152 and you could see very high standard people who came. And I knew exactly what they are doing with \u0152 what they are going to do with them. Before \u0152 this Rauca came over to us, he pulled out his pistol and we were like, six trucks, six guys, and he said to us \u0152 he said, you see, I forbid you to communicate and to talk to these people. There is no way that you can exchange some words, absolutely nothing. If I see yo ur lips moving, I know that you are trying to tell them something or give \u0152 send them a message, so there is going to be nothing else than a bullet through your head. And he just like, took his pistol and \u0152 and \u0152 and \u0152 and just scraped our \u0152 our \u0152 our faces, you know, with that, to \u0152 to \u0152 to impress upon us that he means business, you know. The difficulty was by knowing what \u0152 what\u2122s going to happen to those people. How do we tell th em \u0152 or whether \u0152 whether to tell them was the right thing, or not to tell them. It was so difficult. Now, our task was to take out from the windows, a German with \u0152 with loudspeaker would say to the \u0152 say to one of the cars \u0152 plush cars and say [speaks Ge rman] . It means, give me your packs. You have a few kilometers. You have to go a few kilometers, please give out your packages because it\u2122s going to be very burdensome and we are going \u0152 pla-placing Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 60 these packages in the trucks and we are going to deliver them. And make sure to inscribe your names on the packages so we are going to know how to return that to you. I knew that that\u2122s \u0152 that\u2122s fallacy. I mean, this is \u0152 where they are taking them is to the Ninth Fort and it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s abo ut 10 or 12 miles walking. It\u2122 s not a couple of kilometers. And that\u2122s what\u2122s going to happen to them. And in one case, I saw a lady, which I \u0152 pretty young lady, and \u0152 and I really felt \u0152 with her husband, felt \u0152 a couple apparently \u0152 and I felt very bad and I \u0152 I tried to \u0152 to explain to them, to tell them that \u0152 of course, we were already involved in taking the packages, and \u0152 and I \u0152 I \u0152 I looked around, I didn\u2122t see Rauca there, apparently he went to have something to drink or s omething. And \u0152 and I said to them that, t hey ar e taking you to your death. Try \u0152 when \u0152 when you \u0152 when \u0152 when you will march, try to \u0152 to escape or try to \u0152 to do something or something. You know, the people didn\u2122t believe me. They just didn\u2122t trust me. They trusted the Germans by that time, but they didn\u2122t \u0152 they didn\u2122t trust me. They looked at me and looked at me, and they looked at me like I am \u0152 like I am trying to \u0152 and then I \u0152 I \u0152 I felt very bad about the fact \u0152 I mean, I \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I felt scared that they should not \u0152 they should not give me \u0152 turn me over, or say that I tried to \u0152 to tell them. This \u0152 this was the \u0152 this was the fanatism . Th-Th e German \u0152 the German Jews were very big fanatic. They felt that they were first Germans and then Jews. That was their big \u0152 their big problem. Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 61 They were \u0152 they \u0152 they eliminated from their prayer books, Jerusalem \u0152 it would say, next year in Jerusalem . They used to put in, next year in Berlin . Th-Th-This \u0152 this incident I remember so vividly. And I remember when we took the packages, and we took them directly to the Gestapo. And the Gestapo, they had a big \u0152 a big warehouse where they just threw them in one big pile and then they used to have a \u0152 those people who worked at the Gestapo used to sort them out and place \u0152 for instance, place different items in \u0152 based on a list that they had, which items have to go here and there. You know, they were very meticulous and very organized. The Germans, they were extremely organized. I mean, when it came to organization it was \u0152 I mean, they were leaders in the world on that , you know ."

And there was mostly Lithuanians have done this, under supervision of the \u0152 of the Germans. I \u0152 I have a book here which is \u0152 describes city by city when it happened and how it happened. Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 63 And it happened to be that my father was one of the eld-eldest in the \u0152 in Roki\u0131kis , and \u0152 him and the other one.

And of course, afterwards, last \u0152 two years ago I was in Lithuania , and I went to the place that \u0152 very secluded small place, a few kilometers from the city where they took there \u0152 there were like 2,750 people, children, elderly, and \u0152 which they \u0152 they have massacred \u0152 massacred them there.

So right there they made certain accommodations and they kept there, the people, you know, for \u0152 for a few days and then they took them out to this, three kilometers from the city, the name was Boryar (ph). And you had to go through a narrow path, you know, and there was, like a wooded area and they took them there and there \u0152 there is a \u0152 they have a monument there, on the \u0152 and they \u0152 they shot them \u0152 all of them there."

I had, for instance, a teacher of mathematics by the name of Faulkman (ph). He was a brilliant, brilliant guy. He became a shoe maker in the ghetto. And you know, if you had a trade you had more \u0152 more possibilities to \u0152 to survive and to \u0152 you know, especially, you know, there were many Germans that used to come in and say, l ook, my boots are \u0152 fix th em \u0152 and this and that, and \u0152 or my \u0152 need some buttons here, and I need certain things to \u0152 to be fixed. And tradespeople were able to \u0152 to fulfill their requirement. Now, there were \u0152 basic ally the \u0152 the ghetto were stattin (ph), that\u2122s the way they were called.

And \u0152 and we had shoemakers and we had tailors and we had \u0152 we had all kind of tradespeople who were there. We had also something very interesting, which is going to surprise you, that I\u2122m going to tell you. We had a symphony orchestra within the ghetto. We had people who were very talented, extremely talented. They \u0152 they were performing sometimes with the permission of the \u0152 of the \u0152 of the guards and so forth. We had to announce that \u0152 that we\u2122re going to have a concert \u0152 a concert there. There were people \u0152 writers who wrote and who \u0152 and of course, doctors.

And that was, don\u2122 t get sick if you want to survive. So how can you prevent that? Sometimes, you know, with the snow and the bad weather and the colds.

Now, some of those people, you had to establish them, you had to give them ma \u0152 because we had identification cards. Everyone in the ghetto has a identification. We had to falsify a card, put them in, and some of those people also became employed in the ghetto estattin (ph) \u0152 in \u0152 in the ghetto factories.

And they had \u0152 they were \u0152 they were very, very known in the \u0152 in the community as \u0152 as very educated, and \u0152 and very intelligent people. So this Jellin(ph), who was a really brain, he start forming quietly \u0152 he was in contact with Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 69 a \u0152 you know, when people used to go out to work in the brigades, there were certain contacts, from time to time, with some Lithuanians, and some Jewish people who lived their life like Lithuanians. And through them, through contacts \u0152 which in many cases they failed, because you never knew who is going to betray you. You had sometimes to have confidence. But there were passwords, and there were some certain ways of \u0152 of protecting yourself, and so they started this movement of getting people out, and \u0152 and getting in \u0152 getting to the woods. There was the \u0152 the understanding was that the Germans were very much afraid of the woods, because there were \u0152 there was already started a resistance. But you see, there were a douple \u0152 a double \u0152 a double problem in this respect, because to get out from the ghetto, and to reach the woods, you had to cross, and you had to \u0152 to cr \u0152 g-get involved with some \u0152 with some Lithuanians, in \u0152 in many cases, and you really didn\u2122t know \u0152 you see, they were not the Germans. The \u0152 the biggest problem were the Lithuanians, because they know \u0152 they knew the Germans wouldn\u2122t \u0152 wouldn\u2122t differentiate a Jew from a Lithuanian, but the Lithuanians did \u0152 did \u0152 did \u0152 did know that. From my \u0152 for instance myself, I \u0152 I had few friends who were by themselves, and they \u0152 they decided the y\u2122 re going to join the \u0152 the partisans. There was a very good friend of mine, he was the son of the rabbi from \u2212akiai . \u2212akiai was a small city in Lithuania . [indecipherable] Golden .

He has a \u0152 was a terrible \u0152 a terrible \u0152 a terrible end to this young, brilliant, bright man. He joined the partisans, and in a skirmish \u0152 they were some way betrayed in a skirmish. They had a \u0152 they \u0152 they had a fight between them and the \u0152 and \u0152 and the Germans, he was wounded. And they had to amputate his leg. And something happens th \u0152 happened that this is very, very, very \u0152 I mean, it\u2122s sometimes very hard to describe that. Til this day, I don\u2122t know who this was, because they wouldn\u2122t \u0152 they wouldn\u2122t say. They were a few of his colleagues. They had to pull a straw who should kill him, because they had to move out from this place and they didn\u2122t want to leave him suffering. So one \u0152 one \u0152 one of them pulled the straw and \u0152 and had to pull \u0152 put a bullet in his head, because they just couldn\u2122t cope with somebody that was wounded, was ha \u0152 that his leg had to be amputated, you know.

And this was a \u0152 was a prince \u0152 prince of a guy, you know, I remember \u0152 you know, it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s \u0152 was very sad, and \u0152 but they have a \u0152 I had a number of \u0152 of friends who \u0152 whom I knew exactly where they are going, and we used to supply them with, from time to time with \u0152 with products. And I will explain to you, and that\u2122s the reason why I wanted to tell you the story, what \u0152 what it came \u0152 what \u0152 what I learned to do. I used to \u0152 in many cases, I used to take out the \u0152 my \u0152 take off my stars. I used to go out and \u0152 and exchange \u0152 I used to have like shirts, or something else, you know, if I didn\u2122t Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 71 have, I used to take from somebody else , became some \u0152 something like a \u0152 like a business. And then one day, we had our [indecipherable] the factory of the marmalade on one side of the street. On the other side of the street was a company by the name of Pieno (ph) Sendris (ph). That was a milk products, I would call it a factory, processing place, where they used to make yogurt, and \u0152 and buttermilk, and everything made from milk products. One say, while working in sadiva (ph), at break time, when we had lunch, I came down to the basement, and then I saw in the basement a \u0152 like a sewer pipe. A large pipe, was maybe 20 some inches of diameter. And then I start putting two and two together. I saw that pipe with direction was toward the street, and I told my f \u0152 one of my friends that I had there \u0152 and he happened to be his \u0152 his life as friends. We became sick later, and I \u0152 he used to work, and he used to help and was [indecipherable] told him, Louis Prowther (ph) is his name, he is now an engineer, he lives in Israel . I said, Louis , watch out for me. Let me see what\u2122s on the other end of the pipe. And I climbed in and I climbed through the pipe. And when I came out, I came out to the \u0152 to the heating place, you know, to the \u0152 you know, where they have the \u0152 the heating place for the \u0152 for the \u0152 for \u0152 for the building of the \u0152 the processing building of \u0152 you know, where they had the \u0152 the \u0152 what is that called?

I s \u0152 I am sure that he felt that the devil coming out there. But then I identified myself, I say I am from \u0152 from the other side, from the sadiva(ph), and I would like to find out what is \u0152 about their products what they have, whether there is a possibility that we can bring in some products of \u0152 milk products in the ghetto. To make the story short, from that day, I became very friendly with this guy, and I used to bring different items, exchange with him, and I used to carry back to the ghetto, all kinds of milk products. And they gave me a nickname, they called me Tevye the Milchhiker , you know, from shalo \u0152 from \u0152 from Shole m Aleichem , you know, that, from the \u0152 the famous play, you know, Tevye the Milkman ?

It looked like a \u0152 a prison, surrounded with barbed wire [indecipherable] guards with high lights. It looked like a place of \u0152 a place of no return, I would put it this way, because nobody of those beginning 33,000 people \u0152 although everybody dreamed \u0152 was getting liberated. But in \u0152 in his deep mind, he knew that this is a \u0152 thi-this is a \u0152 a \u0152 a dream that\u2122s never going to be fulfilled. It \u0152 it was as \u0152 as time went by, we \u0152 we found ourselves more secluded, more guarded, more \u0152 we \u0152 we found also when \u0152 when the front starts turning \u0152 turned around, and then like Stalingrad , we f \u0152 we felt that there is a certain additional pressure on us, because Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 75 the Germans, they felt already that they are not \u0152 they didn\u2122t accomplish what they wanted accomplish in four months, because this winter was for the, like Stalin used to say, my best \u0152 the best general, is general winter. Well, this is what devastated the German army. It devastated them to a point, you know, the Germans, they \u0152 they were cut clean, shaved, nicely dressed, you know, nice with their uniform, with their \u0152 with their \u0152 this was a phase. But when they \u0152 when they were encountered by him, when they felt this terrible winter, you know, and where they didn\u2122t have the supplies, because partisans, and especially in the beginning, mostly Russian partisans have cut off the supplies \u0152 all the supplies line were just shattered. And they were not able to get the supplies, where they had to have their lice, and they had to have their \u0152 their \u0152their flea, and \u0152 and the \u0152 and th-the discomfort, and not have the food in their time, and \u0152 and the rifles were \u0152 I mean, the cold winter was so cold their rifles were stuck, you know, they were not able to \u0152 to shoot when they had to shoot. And so they \u0152 they \u0152 they start \u0152 they had different thoughts, and the \u0152 and the punishment for those people that als \u0152 also in the camps, who were in there guarding the camps, was also to send them to the Russian front. The Russian front, the expression to send you to the Russian front was like a sentence of death to a German soldier. So they were \u0152 an -and when they were in this state of mind, that they saw that things have turned around, they also felt that they have to punish their Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 76 what \u0152 wer \u0152 wer \u0152 what \u0152 how can they ex-express their \u0152 their frustration, their \u0152 their \u0152 their \u0152 their disappointment? They cannot say anything against their \u0152 against their \u0152 a-against their leadership, because they wouldn\u2122t do that to \u0152 dare to do that.

Apparently, previously the y have \u0152 they have asked for the \u0152 for the composition of the people who lived in the \u0152 in each \u0152 in each house. You know, it was \u0152 so they \u0152 they had certain records, or somebody gave them the records. And they indiscriminately \u0152 I mean, they have \u0152 they have walked into each house, pulled out \u0152 pulled out the children. And most of the children were \u0152 especially the \u0152 the older ones were \u0152 their mothers were \u0152 were at work at this time. There were only a number of mothers who, when they took the children, they didn\u2122t want to go with their kids. They wouldn't let them \u0152 let them stay with the kids, so they beat them up and they just kicked them and then they Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 85 took away the children. And the mothers were devastated. And especially now at \u0152 at six, seven o'clock, when the people start returning from \u0152 from work, and when they found out this news, it was such a outcry. It was such a tremendous outcry that \u0152 that ev \u0152 everybody was crying and everybody was \u0152 was \u0152 was devastated. It was something that some people throw themse \u0152 threw themself on the \u0152 on the barbed wire, you know, to \u0152 to \u0152 to see whether they just can just get out and \u0152 and \u0152 and \u0152 and do something. And people \u0152 really, the mothers didn\u2122 t \u0152 didn\u2122t care \u0152 care for their life anymore. They \u0152 they \u0152 they just wanted to join them, to be together with their \u0152 with their children. And the police officers \u0152 the way we \u0152 we found out later, they were \u0152 they were investigated, to find out whether there are some kids who were hidden, like we were \u0152 we hid th e \u0152 my \u0152 my cousin, who was really about, at that time, about three years, three and a half years, maybe four years. And besides that, they want also to know where \u0152 because they had information at that time \u0152 It was already \u201a44 and they knew that there we re many, many, many , many freedom fighters who \u0152 who st \u0152 his \u0152 have still a communication with the ghetto, and they had apparently \u0152 it was felt that \u0152 also that the police \u0152 certain police officer have helped some, and still helping some of the \u0152 of the \u0152 of the freedom fighter. So they wanted to find out, and they shot quite a number of police officers. They shot this Greenberg (ph) who \u0152 who \u0152 who was very instrumental. They Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 86 tortured him and shot him, and he would not divulge, and would not give out wher e the \u0152 where the hiding places were. And then the rest of those police officers, they \u0152 part of them \u0152 they returned back \u0152 back to the ghetto, became devastated and found also their \u0152 their children gone. And the \u0152 it was really \u0152 the \u0152 the feeling, I mean, was \u0152 that was so bad, you know, that the \u0152 the whole situation created an incredible loss of \u0152 of hope, you know, when you saw something like this. And this was March and it \u0152 it was already when the Russians have advanced already, substantially towards \u0152 towards the west \u0152 towards \u0152 towards \u0152 they liberated already many, many cities in \u0152 in Russia and they were \u0152 they were moving towards \u0152 towards Lithuania . And that was an episode which is \u0152 which was very, very tragic, you know, very \u0152 even difficul t to \u0152 to describe this. This is \u0152 sometimes we are talking between ourselves, some survivors, and \u0152 and we exchange \u0152 exchange views. And the \u0152 the \u0152 the question is, between one survivor and the other one is, how to make people understand what we went through. I mean, this is \u0152 I mean, it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s \u0152 you see, you are limited in \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 in being able to understand it when \u0152 when somebody tells you something, you know, that\u2122s \u0152 because their \u0152 our \u0152 our minds are \u0152 are in a certain way limited. We cannot understand beyond this limit, you know. And it is, how can somebody describe certain things that like? How can somebody describe that a German SS man takes a Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 87 child of a year old, takes him by his legs and smashes him with his head against \u0152 against a wall? I mean, how can \u0152 I mean, this is \u0152 it \u0152 it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s not even \u0152 even in the most substandard countries, I mean, it\u2122s happening, you know. They \u0152 they kill people, they massacre people, but \u0152 but I don\u2122t think it\u2122s only \u0152 I mean, it\u2122s \u0152 and it\u2122s hard to describe and it\u2122s hard to believe. Sometimes I myself, it\u2122s hard for me to believe that \u0152 that \u0152 it looks to me like a bad nightmare, rather than that it truly happened, you know. An-And \u0152 and time was going so slow, you know. The \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the worst part is that although you worked so hard and you did all kind of \u0152 I didn\u2122t even mention some other work that I used to do, you know. They took us to the \u0152 to the army barracks in \u0152 sometimes and we had to clean out latrines and something else , you know, the y \u0152 and some \u0152 sometimes they took some people and they just threw them into the latrine, I know, just only to \u0152 to have a little pastime for themselves, you know. So I mean, it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s beyond \u0152 beyond description. So that\u2122s \u0152 so that\u2122s one of the reasons why we meet together with survivors sometimes , and we share experiences, we \u0152 we \u0152 we can understand it much better than \u0152 than \u0152 than explaining that to the outer world, you know, it\u2122s \u0152 it \u0152 and it\u2122s very hard to believe that a country so advanced, you know, was \u0152 was get \u0152 getting children and then [indecipherable] and all this. That were \u0152 that were able \u0152 that wer \u0152 came down to a level, to such a level, to \u0152 to \u0152 to be so destructive and so Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 88 without hearts, without \u0152 so the ghetto was \u0152 th-this was a \u0152 at that \u0152 at that stage, it was already a camp, yeah. Now, next move was that we decided that we cannot keep our \u0152 my uncle decided that he cannot keep anymore his daughter there. So we made contact through a \u0152 there was a rabbi\u2122s wife, Shuman (ph) was her name. And I\u2122m sure that she \u0152 she is going to surface in some of your \u0152 some of the places. She was a \u0152 an incredible lady. She was a rabbi\u2122 s wife. Her husband was in Israel \u0152 in Palestine already. And she \u0152 some way he left before that. And she was matchmaking. She was out \u0152 without the \u0152 without the \u0152 the stars. She was going around and finding places to harbor children. So some \u0152 some body told us about her and we were in \u0152 contacted her, and \u0152 and she found a place for Sulami (ph), which was my \u0152 my \u0152 my cousin. She was three and a half, or four years old at that time. My \u0152 my aunt laughs always, she says that I \u0152 I \u0152 I used to have an incredible appetite, you know. And I used to watch, you know \u0152 she used to give her \u0152 sometimes we were able to smuggle in tapioca. You know what is? It\u2122s a \u0152 and I used to sit quietly and watch that and pray that she should not eat the tapioca so it would be left over for me to eat. So she always \u0152 so we decided to do \u0152 how would \u0152 we would do that. At that time, we had two SS people in the ghetto. One name was Fiffiger(ph) and the other name was \u0152 what was the other name? It will come to me pre tty soon. Yeah, it\u2122s [indecipherable] Fiffiger(ph) was a former teacher Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 89 and he was \u0152 very much befriended my uncle. He was v ery nice. He was a SS , and he told the story that he was forced into the SS . And he \u0152 he expressed very good sentiments. So my uncle had to put his confidence \u0152 he showed in \u0152 in few cases, he showed that he was \u0152 he was helpful. And we could see that he i s not one of these \u0152 one of these beasts, you know. So my uncle explained to him and \u0152 and he knew that we are having the child there, and \u0152 against all odds, and he promised my uncle that he is going to help him out. This was a remarkable \u0152 but his comrade, his friend, whose name I forgot, was just the opposite. Just the opposite. What he did once was also beyond \u0152 he encouraged people \u0152 he opened up the \u0152 he opened up th-this \u0152 anyway, first, let me finish with Fiffiger (ph). So they arranged that the \u0152 the \u0152 the bread was coming in twice a week with these big platforms, and then the horses with a driver were going out. So we arranged to \u0152 I gave her the sleeping pill. We put her in a bag because they \u0152 it used to come in bags. So we put her in one of the bags. And we put her under a big \u0152 so they \u0152 she can go through the \u0152 through the gates. Because the gates, they always used to stick something to find where there\u2122s sometimes hide. But it was already prearranged, you know, that apparently he \u0152 he \u0152 he did that \u0152 Fiffiger(ph) did that, you know. And we were able to get her out and she was given away to \u0152 to a very nice Lithuanian family. They took care \u0152 they even baptized her and made her like a part of the \u0152 and she Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 90 spoke only Lithuanian and she was \u0152 she fortunately survived. In exchange, my uncle \u0152 the police officer who was shot, his little boy was also given out to somebody. But he was betrayed and they killed him. Apparently, this Lithuanian that took him was given \u0152 were given certain things in order to do that. They betrayed him and he was \u0152 and we found out later that he was \u0152 he was killed. So \u0152"

            "question": "Yeah, yeah. Tell me a little bit about the ghetto becoming an official concentration camp.",
            "answer": "Well, towards the end of the 1943, we s \u0152 we saw certain movements in a Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 91 different direction . We \u0152 we felt that there is some kind of changes going to be implemented in the ghetto. And we really didn\u2122t \u0152 didn\u2122t know exactly. We felt that the guards were changed. We have \u0152 we have seen more \u0152 that was also a time when we have seen more Hungarians. They brought in Hungarians, and especially some truck drivers. One \u0152 one of them, which I knew pretty well, he was a very bad mouth, and \u0152 but he was not \u0152 not so bad. But the rest were very bad. He was Haymushi (ph). He was a Hungarian truck driver who \u0152 who worked very close with \u0152 with Pilgrim (ph) and \u0152 and Fiffiger(ph). He was, like, always with them. And we felt that by bringing in this nationalist, and by trying to put in more restrictions, and \u0152 and start \u0152 they started also watching more of the \u0152 all the movements and what\u2122s going on, what\u2122s happening in the ghetto. And they were very much concerned and very much were \u0152 were looking for \u0152 for some kind of supplies that the ghetto would supply, or the ghetto would produce, or the ghetto would have some contacts with \u0152 with the \u0152 with the freedom fighters. So in order to have a tighter watch, they \u0152 they have also tried to squeeze out from the police and see whether their police \u0152 to find within the police also some people who would \u0152 who would be on \u0152 on their side. They were not \u0152 were not too much able to \u0152 they had not been able to get from the \u0152 from the Jewish police, except in \u0152 in isolated case \u0152 case s, because the police was well aware of what \u0152 what was Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 92 happening. And they \u0152 they themselves \u0152 the ghetto was the \u0152 with the council in many occasions \u0152 and many cases have tried to help. And they were \u0152 they knew also sometimes the whereabouts of \u0152 of people who \u0152 who would go out to the forest an -an d fight and in different measures and acts of terrorism and \u0152 and blowing up railroads, and sh \u0152 cutting off supplies, and \u0152 and shooting in many cases, in back of the \u0152 of the \u0152 of the Germans. Although the Germans themselves, like \u0152 the Germans themselves, they \u0152 they \u0152 most of the time didn\u2122t dare to invade the forest, because the forest was for them, taboo. But they used for that purpose, they used Lithuanians, in many cases, to \u0152 to find out and to find out the right spots and then they would \u0152 t hey would be able to \u0152 to move in. We also saw the \u0152 not only by \u0152 by the change of the guard and by their behavior, we \u0152 we have felt a bigger presence in the ghetto of \u0152 of the military. Because normally, in all those years, they were \u0152 they were, most of the times, guar-guarding the ghetto from the outside and they were hardly \u0152 not too frequently, they \u0152 they used to come in and \u0152 and \u0152 and look for themselves, look in in certain aspects of the ghetto. Now, in the late \u201a43, we have \u0152 we had a \u0152 a much bigger presence. There were also a repetition of \u0152 of people that \u0152 of requirements for \u0152 for labor force in some other \u0152 other places within Lithuania and \u0152 and outside of Lithuania , whereby they used to come and \u0152 and of course, make a selection , or they used to appeal to the \u0152 to the Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 93 council in order to provide them with \u0152 with \u0152 with those elements who can be useful for them. And most of the times, they \u0152 they \u0152 some of the times they also tried to get some people who \u0152 who had some skills, and tried to use them in the best of their \u0152 their ability. We have seen also that factories, in the \u0152 the verstattin(ph) have been over swamped with \u0152 with additional work. As the front was getting closer, there were more requirements and more necessities to \u0152 for \u0152 for \u0152 for the Germans, for their supplies, and they needed the \u0152 the help and th e \u0152 and the cooperation of this verstattin(ph), so they used to work overtime. I mean, instead ten or 12 hours, they used to work 14 or 15 hours, you know. And they also implemented some shifts in that time. The \u0152 the underground movement grew faster and faster. They \u0152 they had now much better opportunities because the Lithuanians by themselves also were not dumb. They saw that the tide is changing. So they, in many cases, they tried to befriend, and \u0152 and to be a little bit more helpful. Although, the \u0152 the same orders still persisted that if they catch somebody t hat they would have a [indecipherable] . But we have seen that they \u0152 they were more aggressive in \u0152 in hiding people and in helping and \u0152 and in trying to make up for the \u0152 for the damages that they have done before. When the \u0152 in 1944, after the \u0152 after the children\u2122s aktion , and after we have \u0152 we have brought out our \u0152 my cousin from \u0152 from the ghetto, I myself started thinking of terms of \u0152 of getting Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 94 away. I was in contact in two cases, in two ca \u0152"

            "question": "I have to ask you to say that again because of the airplane. What are you going to tell me about now? Are you going to tell me about your escape?",
            "answer": "Mm-hm. The guards, and \u0152 and more frequently coming into the \u0152 to the \u0152 to the ghetto. I didn't see, really a \u0152 I mean, they were as brutal as they used to be because this \u0152 especially the \u0152 the \u0152 the foreigners \u0152 the Hungarians, they were not \u0152 they were not good people , you know that \u0152 especially there. They were \u0152 they were as brutal as they are, maybe some \u0152 some \u0152 some more than \u0152 than the others in \u0152 in many, many occasions. This [indecipherable] the truck driver, I mean, he was [indecipherable] that time when I \u0152 I mentioned about letting \u0152 deceiving the people and telling them they can escape and so forth and so on, because people have started feeling there, the air has changed, in the sense that the front was getting closer and closer. And the question was when and how fast. At the same time, they started getting preparations for \u0152 for \u0152 to liquidate the ghetto. Apparently this was mentioned in \u0152 in a \u0152 in few occasions that \u0152 that pretty soon they have already orders in place in order to eliminate the ghetto, and to \u0152 and to take out all those remains of the \u0152 of the people. At that time, I think \u0152 I\u2122 m \u0152 I\u2122m sure that in the ghetto were not left over more than four or 5,000 people, maybe now \u0152 maybe now from 33,000 that originally \u0152 so what they did is also \u0152 when \u0152 when they \u0152 when Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 95 they used to \u0152 when the ghetto became smaller \u0152 small -smaller in \u0152 in \u0152 in population, they also start cutting off smaller in territory . What they did is, where we had the Varniu (ph) where the \u0152 with the \u0152 with the [indecipherable] was the gate for the supplies, t here was a \u0152 a \u0152 a number of houses that one day they came in and they took a \u0152 a \u0152 a bunch of people, workers, and they didn't remove the fence that was the original fence. What they did is, they put in another fence, cutting off, like, four or five blocks from the \u0152 from the original one. So it became like a ghetto within a ghetto, you know. This was, in a certain way, to my personal advantage, you know, because \u0152 and m aybe some others, which I \u0152 I \u0152 I do \u0152 I don\u2122t know. I can speak for myself on it. What they did is, actually by \u0152 by putting a new fence and putting guards \u0152 putting guards around this fence, they have diminished the guards from the overall fence, which w as before , even without taking off. So, what happened was that, when we used to go to work, we decided \u0152 I have a \u0152 had a \u0152 we were five \u0152 five people that we decided to \u0152 to flee the camp. We saw that \u0152 already that the time is running out. I spoke to \u0152 three times to one friend of mine that was in the \u0152 was in the \u0152 in the partisans. And he told me that whenever I want to join them I should \u0152 I should contact somebody, and \u0152 in order to join them. The only thing is, after that I tried to get the \u0152 the other \u0152 th-the contact man and he was already gone, also. So I went to my \u0152 where my uncle was and I told him, l ook, I Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 96 think that it\u2122s no \u0152 no reason for me to remain here. I mean, it\u2122s \u0152 we\u2122re \u0152 we\u2122re close. We\u2122 re very close to the end. I mean, it\u2122s \u0152 they are going \u0152 one of these days, we are going to get up and we\u2122re going to find ourselves surrounded by \u0152 by trucks and they are \u0152 they are just going to take us, and \u0152 and \u0152 and ta-take us out and \u0152 and take us to camps, or take us somewhere else, or \u0152 or \u0152 or take us to the Ninth Fort. So my uncle, who was very conservative always \u0152 and he really was very close to me, was \u0152 was like \u0152 like a father to me, you know. And th-this was maybe one of reasons that \u0152 that I have not left the place sooner. And especia lly my grandmother, she was crazy about me, you know, she [indecipherable] that time when I saved her , you know , she \u0152 she would not \u0152 and we knew that she \u0152 she \u0152 also \u0152 also survived, you know, the \u0152 the children\u2122s aktion that time also when \u0152 because sh e was with a child inside, but her, we couldn\u2122t get \u0152 get her out, because well, it would be too \u0152 too difficult, you know. A child is something that \u0152 el -else. So what \u0152 so my uncle came to the conclusion , say that\u2122s fine and gave me his blessing, I mean, it \u0152 and I deciding to \u0152 now, how are we going to do it? So I \u0152 I devised a plan, in other word, the houses which were behind the first \u0152 the general fence, a few h ouses still left. They have \u0152 normally, in many cases they would explode some of the houses. They would put in some dynamite and explode it. Here, they \u0152 they have \u0152 and \u0152 and they did it later on with the r \u0152 with the \u0152 with Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 97 the rest of the ghetto. So I had a \u0152 I had three more people with me \u0152 three \u0152 four. There was one \u0152 one guy that was himself from Poland and for \u0152 some way he was stuck in \u0152 in \u0152 in Kovno , and never was able to get out. And then it was the nephew of \u0152 the nephew of my aunt, who is now in Charlotte , North Carolina . And then the other one was a guy that used to \u0152 frequently to come to our house. And then it was the other fellow that worked also with \u0152 was a nephew of somebody who worked with my \u0152 with my uncle. So, then this guy knew \u0152 supposedly he knew the road, how to \u0152 I mean, where to go in order to get to the forest."

And one day when we came back from work, we have \u0152 we \u0152 we just defected from the \u0152 from \u0152 from the group, which was large group, when we came back from work. And we went into this house and then we watched the out guard \u0152 the outside guard \u0152 we had also special pliers to cut \u0152 to cut the wire. We have \u0152 wait til the night. On that third day, we cut through \u0152 in our supplies what we had was water, sugar, and bread. We \u0152 we watched \u0152 we timed the guards that was walking, we cut through the wires, and we Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 98 just came out. And we \u0152 it was nighttime and we were not able to go too far because night \u0152 nighttime, it was \u0152 it was a \u0152 it was very dangerous to go, because you\u2122 re able \u0152 I mean, they would stop you and then right away there, you would be finished. So we hid in a \u0152 in a \u0152 next to a house in the garden, w here it was dense bushes and we stayed there for \u0152 for a \u0152 for the night. And then early morning, we left and we went towards the woods \u0152 towards the woods which was Janava. That was a \u0152 a place w here there were al \u0152 the re al ready some partisans were \u0152 were working \u0152 were working in \u0152 in the \u0152 in the \u0152 in the exploding some supplies \u0152 some supplies for the Germans and so on. Okay. We had to go through to a \u0152 through a main highway. And when we walked, we walked like in one behind the other one. So when we reached the highway \u0152 and this was during the daytime already, a guy with a \u0152 with a bicycle and was dressed in \u0152 in civilian but with a rifle, was there waiting for us. And when we approached him, I mean, he took off the rifle and he said, your documents. Okay. We start running in different directions.

            "answer": "Towards the beginning of \u201a44, we have seen with a \u0152 with a change also, the status of the ghetto \u0152 from the ghetto to a concentration camp. We felt a new \u0152 a new arrangements and \u0152 and some things \u0152 certain things \u0152 certain changes which we \u0152 it was not too hard for us to figure out. We saw that the handwriting on the wall. We saw that everything what\u2122s happening with the Russian army, the victorious expelling, pushing the Germans towards \u0152 towards the \u0152 towards the Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 100 west. And we felt also that there is time for \u0152 for me and for some friends to \u0152 to get out and get out as soon as possible because every \u0152 every day was a matter that \u0152 we knew exactly that \u0152 what our fate was going to be. So truthfully, we didn't have too much to risk because one way or the other way, I mean, we would \u0152 we would not be able to survive. So I went to see my uncle and I told him that \u0152 and my grandmother, I told them that I\u2122 m \u0152 I \u0152 I\u2122m ready, with \u0152 with my other fellow \u0152 fellow friends to \u0152 to get out, and to get out as fast. So my uncle I \u0152 my uncle also gave me a \u0152 he had like a little golden coin and he gave this to me and he said, look, in case of necessity or something, I mean, you \u0152 he \u0152 he \u0152 he had like three of them, you know, so he was hiding that always in \u0152 somewhere. So when \u0152 soon I got together with my \u0152 with my friends and when we went to work, coming back we just evaded the guards and we came into one of the houses that we marked for \u0152 for our shelter in \u0152 in \u0152 in between, in order to be able to \u0152 to plan our \u0152 our escape. The \u0152 one of my friends was much younger than us, a couple of years, and he was a short one, and we used him as the outlook. So he used to look and to watch. And he was the one that timed the steps of the \u0152 of the guard on the outside of the fence, and then came to the conclusion. He gave us the signal, we came out, we cut through the wires and that was nighttime. And we just slipped out, all of us. Because we \u0152 really the security was behind us in the \u0152 in the smaller ghetto where Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 101 there was double-rolled barbed wire. This was all \u0152 this was a old fence which they have never tried to repair because they were \u0152 there was \u0152 the ghetto was in the ghetto, you know. Now, when we had to \u0152 we slept over there in a \u0152 in a \u0152 in a garden, a dense garden. And in the morning we start going. But we left a distance between ourselves. Rather than walking in a group, we walked, like, one by one, some meters, one behind the other one. When we came through a \u0152 through a \u0152 with a bo \u0152 to a place where we had to cross the highway, there was one person with a \u0152 with a bicycle, and a rifle on his shoulder, a Lithuanian. And suddenly h e came out and approached us, say, stop, documents. Raise your hands. So when he did that, we start running in different directions. It was only one person and we knew that he might shoot one but he cannot shoot everybody, you know. Besides that, his aim was not too good because I felt \u0152 when I run, I felt like, a couple bullets passing me and then I don't know. I \u0152 I \u0152 I rea lly ran like never in my life, a nd then I threw myself in the cornfield. I know also that later on when I was laying there for quite a while, I know that they \u0152 they had some \u0152 some people with horses try to locate somebody, and I hoped that they are not going to find anybody. But I, during nighttime I walked about additional half a mile and I saw ble \u0152 flickering lights. And I say to myself, without these \u0152 would that be headquarter \u0152 would \u0152 would that be quarters for the Germans or some barracks or something? Then I stepped Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 102 away and I found myself close to a small, small woods. And there I slept over the night. It was really \u0152 it was a little bit cold nighttime, but I covered myself with leaves and some other things. And there was a little \u0152 a little \u0152 I wouldn't say a river, but it was little place with \u0152 with water. And then I \u0152 I was hiding behind the bushes. In the morning, I heard some voices in Russian, and I \u0152 I watched that, and I saw that there \u0152 there, a woman came and she \u0152 apparently two friends, but one stayed with a \u0152 with a metal thing, you know, what they \u0152 they put here \u0152 put in cloth. And she started washing right there in this \u0152 where there was li \u0152 this was not even like a river, but it was a place that I remember that I had drunk water. I had my hat, so with my hat I used to take and \u0152 and \u0152 and drink the water. Because food was nothing. I \u0152 I used to collect some \u0152 some berries, you know, from wild berries, and this was my food. So I was desperate. I was very hungry and this woman was washing and I said to myself, let me \u0152 let me approach her. And I spoke perfect Russian, of course. So I came out. I said, look, I\u2122 m \u0152 I\u2122m escapee, and like you should help me with some food. So I was not sure whether she was going to go \u0152 first of all, I didn\u2122t know. I asked her what was there in this \u0152 in this place, where I saw the flickering lights in the night. And she said, no, that\u2122s a camp, a civilian caca mp for civilian Russians. An intern camp for civilian Russians. But then she told me that she is going to come back and bring me some food. And I \u0152 I thought to Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 103 myself, I prayed, I said, or she is going to bring me food, or she is going to bring me a German who is going to \u0152 to kill me? About 15 minutes later she comes back with a bottle of milk and a piece of spec (ph) \u0152 you know, that\u2122s \u0152 that\u2122s from \u0152 it\u2122s like meat, fat meat, you know \u0152 and a piece of bread. And then I started talking to her and she said to me that she got scared when she saw me, because I looked like I\u2122m an old, you know, the \u0152 and I explained to her that I\u2122m a refugee, and so forth. And so she said to me, look, we have in our camp two Russian prisoners who \u0152 who fled, and who are hiding in our \u0152 in this \u0152 in this camp. And they also are going to \u0152 they are planning to go to join the \u0152 the freedom fighters, the partisans. And where they are going? They are going to Janava , Janava , Belder(ph), that used to be Janava , the forest of Janava , which was not too far away from there. And this guy Scheiker (ph), that was with me, he \u0152 he \u0152 he was leaving us, and he told us, and he explained to me, because he himself was from Janava , and he told us \u0152 he gave me certain \u0152 certain parameters. But now, I mean, he was \u0152 he was gone, so I had to do that myself. So then, in the \u0152 in the evening, sh-sh \u0152 the two Russians came over. They had knives for themselves, and they asked me a few questions, and they wanted to verify whether I am legit and I shouldn\u2122t be \u0152 I shouldn't be some \u0152 the bay \u0152 betray them . And then the next morning, early in the morning, we went to the woods, we approached them, and one of them had apparently a contact, or he knew Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 104 exactly a certain spot. First of all, th-the Russian prisoners were not treated very friendly by the Russians, because Stalin\u2122s \u0152 Stalin\u2122s view was that the Russian s should never fell in a prisoner life, I mean, he should give his life for the country. But of course, this \u0152 that was not the case. So he took us to the forms \u0152 forest at one point and he \u0152 then we met about three or four more guys there. They were from the \u0152 from \u0152 apparently also, they were former Russian prisoners. And they had already a plan, a top \u0152 topographic plan, and they had all rolls. So they said that they have received some supplies from \u0152 from parachutes that they \u0152 and they had some assignment to watch and to see whether some German forces are going \u0152 i f they are going to be close by, they have to communicate and they have to try to do certain sabotage \u0152 sabotage work. We spent about, I would say, maybe about close to 20 days moving around from one spot to the other one, because we didn\u2122t want to stay in one spot. And on few occasions \u0152 I was not trained, I didn\u2122t \u0152 I didn\u2122t know anything about \u0152 about ammunition or anything. They have done, basically, the work. And the \u0152 in \u0152 in different cases, I was the look out. They used me to be the look out. They had some \u0152 some light arms and knives basically, and they had some back packs with \u0152 with ammunition. We spent, I would say, about four weeks. And one \u0152 one day, we heard a movement. We put our ears \u0152 normally, what we used to do is, we used to put our ears to the grounds, so we can detect \u0152 that\u2122s a way of Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 105 detect whether there is some heavy movements. And here we detected that some \u0152 based on our imaginations, some tanks. And now we saw about three or four German tanks rolling not too far away, you know. And then about a couple hours later, we heard some shootings, and an exchange of fire. And this whole neighborhood vicinity became like a \u0152 like a \u0152 like a military, I mean, hell. Because bullets and flying out the \u0152 in the shrubs, and saw burning \u0152 burning bushes and all this, you know. It was an incredible, incredible exchange of fire. Then, it lasted for about an hour, an hour and a half, and it looked to me that it lasted forever, you know. Because we found ourselves in the middle and we said to ourselves, n ow we are going to be killed by \u0152 by friendly \u0152 by friendly \u0152 our friendly power \u0152 gun power. Suddenly, it quietened down. It was quiet like nothing \u0152 I mean, like \u0152 like nothing ever \u0152 anything happened, you know. And I say to the \u0152 to one of Russians, I say, what \u0152 what would that be? I mean it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s too quiet, I mean, we got used already to the \u0152 to the \u0152 to the \u0152 to the incredible sound of \u0152 of \u0152 of explosions, you know. And then suddenly we heard again, we put \u0152 the Russian put his \u0152 he put his ear on the ground. He said, something is happening. It\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s quite apparent ly, but something is happening. And, like 45 minutes later, we heard \u0152 we heard some movement of, like, troops. Not too many. And then we saw the first Russians approaching us. And the first question was \u0152 the first question was, have you seen Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 106 some tanks? I sort of , yeah, we saw quite a few hours ago. And he said, no, these tanks already finished. Have you seen some other tanks? And we say, no. Right away it was \u0152 I was amazed, you know, because right away I \u0152 I was approached by \u0152 by one of the lieutenants. I think it was a capt ain, not a lieut enant \u0152 captain, because he had three stars, yeah. It was a captain, and he \u0152 he actually told me that \u0152 he looked at me and looked at me and says, are you Jewish? I say yes. So am I, he said. Okay, we embraced each other and he \u0152 right away what he did is, he told us \u0152 he said, look, this is the front line, and the line might change, because we don\u2122t know what \u0152 what \u0152 what \u0152 what is ha \u0152 what can \u0152 what is going to happen a few kilometers from here. My advice is, and what I want to see you, is to the till. Till is towards the back, towards the [indecipherable] , you know, towards the back, you know. And right away, he called a \u0152 a \u0152 a soldier and he said, take these guys and take them over. And \u0152 and in meantime, w e was already approaching s ome Jeeps and some \u0152 some other \u0152 some other military units. And he told us to move as far as possible towards the back. He said, you went through already, it\u2122s sufficient. I mean, it\u2122s \u0152 and th-this was the \u0152 this was actually the \u0152 the \u0152 the way that we \u0152 so happy. I mean, the first time we felt like \u0152 felt like liberated, you know. And then he asked me \u0152 another guy that he referred me to ask me some question. He said me whether I want to join the army, or I want to do. I said, no, no, first what I want to Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 107 do is, I want to go \u0152 I want to see \u0152 because my question was, how soon are they going to liberate Kaunas ? He said, that might take still a few days or \u0152 or it might still take some \u0152 some time. So we were with the army for about \u0152 I think about ten or 15 days til they have to [indecipherable] Kaunas and to liberate it. I went right away to the \u0152 to the \u0152 to the ghetto. The ghetto was exploded. Everything, all the houses were exploded. They have \u0152 some people came out from the hiding in some places. Some people came out from hiding. I went to this place where we were hiding and we had some photographs and I found some photographs. But supplies and other things that we had in \u0152 in our \u0152 in our house, and in the ground was nothing. It was like, everything burned. And right away I went to \u0152 to Kaunas . This was Slobodka . I went to Kaunas , I got myself \u0152 right away I met with this officer, that he told me that he is going to \u0152 he is \u0152 I mean, that he is going to be coming to Kaunas , and he gave me a number wher e I can \u0152 I can reach him. And he told me that if I have some \u0152 some kind of desire of some \u0152 some thing. I said, yeah, I would like to have \u0152 I have some \u0152 I have some relatives here, and I would like to see whether I can find them. Where \u0152 where are there \u0152 I \u0152 I am sure \u0152 I felt they were very optimistic. I said maybe there are some relatives that I have. And I start floundering around for quite a few days. And then I found a family, that we were together in the ghetto and then later, they went to Canada. But I used to send them Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 108 packages when I was in there \u0152 when \u0152 just a minute \u0152 that I send them packages after, when I \u0152 when I \u0152 when I was in the army. They \u0152 I helped them to find a place \u0152 a living place because the \u0152 the city was \u0152 was devastated, you know. There \u0152 there was not too many \u0152 too big fights in the city, but it was many have escaped and left behind themselves apartments with furniture, and you know, like \u0152 the same way like when the \u0152 when the \u0152 when the Germans came in. So right away I found a \u0152 a friend of mine, who told me that if I would like to serve \u0152 to serve in the \u0152 in the Russian army because, due to the fact that I have finished gymnasium, and I speak the \u0152 I speak Lithuanian, German, and \u0152 an -and Russian, so I would be a good prospect. He se \u0152 he told me that there is coming a \u0152 a group of \u0152 a \u0152 a group of people to \u0152 of military men to take some \u0152 to take \u0152 to \u0152 to \u0152 they are looking for some inper \u0152 interpreter. They need very badly people who speak Lithuanian and Russian. Basically German is not, at this point, is not important, but it\u2122s going to become important later. And at the same time, they promulgated a law that all these people from this and this year, they are going to be \u0152 they are going to be from 1924, 1925, 1926, they are going to be taken to the army \u0152 to the regular army. And I say to myself, I would rather serve in a specialty unit than \u0152 than to wait and then be recruited to the army. They have like a place where they called wayan (ph) komat (ph). This is a \u0152 a \u0152 a military place, whereby they check out new \u0152 t hey Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 109 check out prospective soldiers, you know, health-wise and whether they have TB because there were many with \u0152 with TB, you know, from those that survived. So I actually signed up for this \u0152 for this unit. I remember a younger captain came in and \u0152 and interviewed me and he was satisfied. And then what he told me that he is going to recruit me and I will have to go through a short preparation \u0152 military preparation of about six weeks. And I agreed. In meant ime, he told me I can \u0152 I can stay there and he gave me a official paper where I can go and find myself a \u0152 a \u0152 a apartment. So I found my relatives, those I mentioned, and I found myself not too far away where I used to live before, on the sa me [indeciphe rable] on same main street. I got myself a nice apartment and my relatives were very happy. They had two children and \u0152 and myself and I told them, look, I a m goin g to be just here, and only temporary, and I a m \u0152 I am going to be leaving. And also, was ver y interesting walking on the \u0152 when I got myself a bicycle an-and riding on the bike, I met a very good friend of mine, this Harmutz (ph), who was the \u0152 the head of th e ORT. He wasn\u2122t in the ghetto and he was involved in the partisans. And he esca \u0152 I mean, he joined in also in the army but in the civilian department. They made him a \u0152 like a commissar, or something, in the civilian department because he \u0152 he had excellent contacts in the \u0152 with some high-ranking people. So I met with him and it was incredible, incredible meeting, you know, to \u0152 in \u0152 in middle of \u0152 of \u0152 of nowhere Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 110 or something like, you know, in the middle of the city, to meet somebody that was such a close friend of mine. Then, from there, I \u0152 I was \u0152 I was sent to a \u0152 to a \u0152 to a training camp, and in about six weeks they send me to the first mission. I mean, I was recruited, got the uniform, got my \u0152 they sent me within Lithuania , in certain places to \u0152 to be attached to the \u0152 there was also \u0152 you see, there was also a Lithuanian brigade under the Commander Vilinski (ph), who was \u0152 which was formed right when the war \u0152 in the beginning of the war. Very brave. Many of those people died in \u0152 in deep Russia, you know, and it was incredible, really. But I didn\u2122t \u0152 I joined the regular arar my, wh ich I \u0152 I said that is a policing force, which is called the \u0152 it was the 33rd regiment of the [indecipherable] NKVD , which was the border police, attached to the NKVD. After the training and after they send me to Lithuania , they send me to a place, to Lie , which was Courland , in \u0152 that was in Latvia . And there \u0152 there we had big \u0152 a big fight because there were \u0152 there were the \u0152 I don't know whether you heard about the Vlasovtsy . That is a General Vlasov, a Ukrainian who joined the Germans and he created a Ukrainian \u0152 Ukrainian battalion. Alway \u0152 almost the army, who fought with the Germans against the Russians, against their own people. So there were entrenched the \u0152 a group of \u0152 of those people, and they fought tooth and nail because they knew that i f they are going to be captured, they are going to be killed [indecipherable] . They Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 111 wouldn't take them as prisoners. And there I had my \u0152 my first accident. I was in a Jeep with a \u0152 with a captain, and \u0152 and a driver, and there was a big shelling, and it hit the Jeep , and I was just knocked out fro-from the Jeep , and I found myself later in the hospital. Thanks God I had only two broken ribs and \u0152 and small \u0152 small contusions and some \u0152 some other things, you know . But the captain who was sitting next to me was killed, a Russian captain. And then from there, I \u0152 they sent me after I \u0152 took me about 14, 15 days to \u0152 to be back on my feet \u0152 t hey \u0152 they send me to Germany , was to ca \u0152 and participate in \u0152 in liberating the City of K\u00f6nigsburg , which was very interesting. And from there, they came a order to \u0152 after a while, came an order \u0152 a special order, that our regiment was going to be sent entirely to the [indecipherable] Islands, to the Japanese front. And I was the only one that got the assignment to join Chuikov\u2122s army in the direction of Berlin. And this was \u0152 and I feel that this was because the \u0152 the colonel that was in charge, Venakurov (ph), I think it was, Jewish.

And then there I joined the \u0152 I joined Chuikov\u2122s forces. And this was incredible experience, incredible experience.

At that time, the colonel that was the head of my superior officer, he wanted to make a small process, similar to the Nuremberg process. And that was one of the reasons why we went twice to Nuremberg , before consultations. But then I \u0152 truthfully, I don\u2122t know what happened afterwards, you know, because he was called to \u0152 he was called to Moscow , to meet with Molotov, for a certain \u0152 for \u0152 for certain reasons, and fortunately for me, I \u0152 I was not able to see him when he came back, because I was not in the Russian army any more when \u0152 when he came back.

And there was a case within this investigation, where we had a lieutenant that broke down, because the investigation, we used to \u0152 the \u0152 we used to conduct them between one and four o\u2122clock in the morning. And this was \u0152 precisely this was done in this fashion, because that was the \u0152 the way the \u0152 the KGB, and the NKVD used to \u0152 used to conduct themselves, because they feel that in this they\u2122re under \u0152 under \u0152 under \u0152 in \u0152 in a silent Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 117 ambience, and with \u0152 with \u0152 with some heavy lights focused on the \u0152 on the \u0152 on the prisoner, and the heavy questioning, t hey \u0152 they had no choice but they had to \u0152 to spill out all the information that they had. So we had this case with the lieutenant who \u0152 who broke down, and he jumped through \u0152 broke the window, jumped down and \u0152 and fell on top of a picket fence. And we thought that he \u0152 he wanted to commit suicide, you know, but fortunately for him, he \u0152 he survived, and he was able then later to complete \u0152 complete the investigation and give us the additional information that we were looking for. I mean, especially so longer it was, we were preparing for a process, we needed more exact information about th-the conditions, and about the brutalities they have committed, and their approach to the \u0152 to the prisoners with their \u0152 their food rationing, their \u0152 their \u0152 the \u0152 the composition of the \u0152 of the people in the \u0152 in the \u0152 in the \u0152 in the camp, and the \u0152 and so many details that were \u0152 everything were \u0152 we had \u0152 everything was written down, and \u0152 and ready, almost, for a \u0152 for a process."

It was a tactical \u0152 I \u0152 it was \u0152 it was a \u0152 a good decision in one way, and a bad decision in a si \u0152 in the other way, because this what prompted for what happened afterwards, because Berlin was taken by the Russians. The Russians were very happy, because to them, you see, the Americans, they are more geared for \u0152 for individuals. The Russians are more geared f or masses . The ind-individuals don\u2122t count, you know, and they didn\u2122t count in the Soviet Union . So they fell to \u0152 to sacrifice 50,000 more of troops couldn\u2122t make a difference, you know.

He used to give me something like a [indecipherable] and I was very, very happy, you know. And then, when I used to go with the gramophone factory, used to be loaded with gramophones, you know. They \u0152 the Germans, I mean they \u0152 they had a \u0152 a very interesting thing, it\u2122s when they \u0152 when \u0152 when they capitulated, I Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 125 mean, that was it. They wouldn\u2122t get involved in the \u0152 in the \u0152 in terrorist or some other activities, that was it. In the meantime, I used to go with \u0152 wit h Colonel Baruck(ph). He \u0152 he was very friendly with the chief of police from \u0152 from Berlin , and they used to go hunting together, and I was with them, always. So one day, I \u0152 I became friendly also with the chief of police, and I told him I \u0152 I say, I\u2122m involved in \u0152 in this type of activities where sometimes I have to go from one sector \u0152 now that Berlin is divided four sector; the French, the British, the Russian, and the \u0152 and the American. I says, and I am sometimes in jeopardy, so I need a \u0152 a ausweis \u0152 I \u0152 a card, as a German. He hesitated, but then he gave it to me, you know. And I say, don\u2122t mention it to anybody, because this is due to my work, you know. So, when I met with Helmut (ph) Selten (ph), and I disclosed him that I eventually want to \u0152 I have relatives in Cuba , and I\u2122d like to get out, because pretty soon they\u2122re going to demobilize me and send me back to Lithuania , which was \u0152 I didn\u2122t have any desire to go back to Lithuania . So we start actively pursuing, I mean, how to \u0152 what \u0152 what \u0152 what to do, how to \u0152 so one day he comes for \u0152 to me, very happy, and he says, listen, I mean, there is a Joint \u0152 the Joint Distribution Center in \u0152 in West Berlin , in the American sector. Why don\u2122t we go over there? And I used to wear sometimes, civilian clothes also, because due to my work, I mean, I used to have to be camouflaged, you know, so I wore more civilian than \u0152 than military. So Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 126 I say, okay, let\u2122s \u0152 let\u2122s move. So, we took the U-Bahn, you know, the metro? And we went to \u0152 I think it was in \u0152 in Charlottenburg . So, we came into the Joint Distribution, and there is a American colonel, and I say, look, I\u2122m a \u0152 a Russian and Jewish officer in the Russian army, and I would like to \u0152 you should help me to flee, and I \u0152 I have my relatives in Cuba , and I \u0152 I just would like to get away, because \u0152 I explained to him, I say, I\u2122m going to be very openly where you \u0152 open with you, I am truthfully \u0152 I mean, it\u2122s \u0152 I \u0152 they \u0152 I have no use any more to be here. I mean, I have already accomplished what I felt to accomplish. Now I will \u0152 what I want is to \u0152 to \u0152 to get to my family, I mean, because I am by myself. They\u2122re going to send me back to \u0152 he said, look, we\u2122re sorry, but we cannot do anything, because we have a very good relationship with the Russian, they\u2122re our allies, and we cannot create a \u0152 a \u0152 a \u0152 a international conflict. I say, international [indecipherable] . So I almost [indecipherable] because I saw here that my \u0152 my opportunity to \u0152 to \u0152 to \u0152 to get out, and I thought, they\u2122re going to \u0152 like, I\u2122m going to declare myself like a \u0152 a \u0152 a refugee, and then that\u2122s it. So he says \u0152 he calls on his secretary. He said, look, you know where your relatives are in Cuba , what\u2122s their name? And I say, yes, I have their name. Do you \u0152 do you know where they are? I say, no, they\u2122re in Havana. Do you have a address? I give to her address. So I say, why don\u2122t you send \u0152 we are going to send a telegram. We\u2122re going to send Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 127 that to the Jewish community center in Havana , to make the story short. And I thought, I mean, this is a \u0152 I mean, he just wanted to get rid of me, and then he \u0152 he \u0152 he just [indecipherable] . Exactly 20 days later, Helmut (ph) calls me and says, hey. He says, I have a letter from Cuba for you. A month later, and I almost fainted, you know. I had my, in Yiddish [indecipherable] letter from my uncle, telling me that my other uncle, you know, that I left, and he was in the concentration camp in Buchenwald was liberated. His wife was liberated, and they tried to locate th e daughter. And that my friend, this Prather (ph), that he was together with me in \u0152 in the \u0152 in the camps, and I helped him, is in Munich , and he\u2122s studying engineering, and they\u2122re going to get in touch with him to \u0152 he should help me escape. And pretty soon I received another letter, from Munich , from \u0152 and this letters wer \u0152 went to Helmut (ph) Selten (ph), not to me, of course, because I had to be very \u0152 very much \u0152 very much careful, because any \u0152 any step on the side, I would have been completely \u0152 I mean, they would send me to Siberi a. Not even that, they would shoot me. There would be a court martial. So \u0152 can we interrupt for a minute?"

            "answer": "So I received \u0152 I received a letter from Louie\u2122s brother, who was in Munich , school of \u0152 engineering school, and beautiful letter from him, that he\u2122s going to try Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 128 to do everything possible, that he received, he received a \u0152 a \u0152 a letter from Cuba , from my uncles. And incidentally, my \u0152 my letter [indecipherable] mine \u0152 my letter went to Cuba . I mean, not my letter, their \u0152 their \u0152 their \u0152 their telegram that they sent from the \u0152 from the Joint Distribution Center, they send it to the \u0152 to the Jewish Community Center. My uncle was the president at that time, from the community center. He was the one that brought most of the family, brought the other uncle, and everything. So Prather (ph) told me in his letter \u0152 I mean, he mentioned that he is going to \u0152 that he has a \u0152 a hunch that \u0152 that he has already somebody that \u0152 that will be able \u0152 be in \u0152 that\u2122s going to be helpful in my \u0152 in my defection from the Russian army. That time, I remember it was already \u0152 it was Passover. And Helmut (ph), I mean the contact was Helmut (ph) all the time. Helmut (ph) calls me again and says there is \u0152 there is some people that came from [indecipherable] a husband and wife and a child. Three people. And they want to meet with me. So I made sure that nobody\u2122s following me, and I met with them. And this was a guy that was a \u0152 a smuggler. He used to smuggle from the \u0152 from the American \u0152 from the Russian zone, certain items to the American zone, and from the American zone to the Russian zone. So he approached me, told me that he is \u0152 that Prather (ph) sent him, and that he understand that I want to be helped to cross the border in a certain place, which he \u0152 he knows very well, he says. And he Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 129 travels always with his wife and child, because that makes \u0152 doesn\u2122t gi \u0152 doesn\u2122t make him too \u0152 those \u0152 the people, and the guards to be suspicious. He didn\u2122t know that I am \u0152 I am in \u0152 in the Russian army, and Prather (ph) ca utioned me against that, he said, don\u2122t tell him that you are in the army, because then he is not going to do that, and then he is not going to help you. So I told him, look, I\u2122m also in the smuggling business, and I do this and this and that, and I have \u0152 have certain contacts which I want to see in the \u0152 in American zone, and this and that. So we arranged this. I went to the \u0152 I left him behind, I went to the bahnhof , to the train station, and there were a huge amount of people. I went in uniform, and I bought four tickets, to go like to \u0152 in the direction of Bremen , with the train. Then I \u0152 I took my motorcycle , and I took it to a safe place, and I called a guy, and say okay, we have the tickets. When do we go? He say, we have to go immediately. Says, there is no time to \u0152 to waste. I get myself \u0152"

            "answer": "I have a \u0152 first of all, I calmed down for a minute, and I was very excited, because that was a \u0152 a \u0152 a incredible step to take, you know, because to \u0152 to go out \u0152 it\u2122s not to leave Berlin , because you see, Berlin ha \u0152 was in four sectors. But Berlin by itself, found itself within the Russian occupational zone, which means Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 130 that in order to get out from Berlin is not to get out of Berlin, I had to get out from the whole zone, to cross through hundred \u0152 few hundred kilometers. And this is not \u0152 it\u2122s not easy, because although at that time, in 1947 \u0152 that was already 1947, in that time there was still not \u0152 there was still not as tight as it became tighter later. So I \u0152 I figured out, what shall I do? So I had a little, small caliber pistol, which I took away from my German officer, still in \u0152 in K\u00f6nigsburg \u0152 with \u0152 the handles were made from elephant bone. Beautiful, you know, it\u2122s \u0152 it was something remarkable. And I had a bunch of \u0152 first of all, in the \u0152 in the army, the Russian army I was paid as a officer, I received a certain amount of money in Russian rubles, and then a double amount in German occupational marks. I had money, I had more than what I can \u0152 was able to use. And incidentally, I used to send \u0152 every month I was able to send two packages, and I used to send to my relatives in \u0152 in \u0152 in Kovno , his family. Every \u0152 every month I send them two big packages, with all kind of goodies. So then I had my \u0152 End of Tape Eight Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 131 Beginning Tape Nine"

One day, I will talk to Spielberg , you know, one day we\u2122ll \u0152 we\u2122ll make a very profitable film for him. So \u0152 so I had my German ausweis , which I got from the chief of police when we were out hunting. I had my \u0152 my Russian ausweis . I had money, rubles, money in German occupational marks, and I have a little caliber pistol. And the little caliber was \u0152 was \u0152 and you will not believe for what. Not to shoot anybody, but to shoot myself if \u0152 if \u0152 if they would \u0152 if they would catch me because there\u2122s no question in my mind, th-th ey would \u0152 they would have done this without any reproach, you know. So \u0152 and then we moved to the \u0152 moved to the train, and I figured already everything out. I figured we have a long voyage to a small town which is going the direction to Bremen , but Bremen is in the eng \u0152 in the British Zone of occupation. But I felt that \u0152 I figured out, I said, I know that this train is going to be searched. There is going to be a \u0152 some type of guard is going to come in at some certain point to check the documenta \u0152 documents on the train. Because that was a normal procedure and I \u0152 I knew it\u2122s going to happen. I also \u0152 I thought to myself, it\u2122 s going to come in a German guard, I\u2122m going to show them that I am a Russian and I traveled there to see some relatives. And I didn\u2122t have a Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 132 problem because I \u0152 I had also this Baruck (ph), my colonel, was out of town. He was in \u0152 in Moscow for a conference, and I had the right to \u0152 to \u0152 to travel to a certain \u0152 certain distance, because I need \u0152 I neede d a special permit, which I didn\u2122t have. But I could \u0152 I could justify my trip, you know, because I didn\u2122 t \u0152 I didn\u2122t carry with me any \u0152 any \u0152 any belongings or anything, it\u2122s just only a small thing. Then I said, if it comes a Russian, I\u2122m going to identify myself as a German. What can I do? Okay. We \u0152 we travel. The train was crowded. I mean, so crowded it was that \u0152 were unable to turn. Suddenly, we come to a certain point, there\u2122s soldiers. Russian and Germans together. I say, that\u2122s my day. That\u2122s my day, what shall I do? And I had to think quickly. I was next to the guy with the \u0152 with his wife , and we were chatting and \u0152 and here comes the guard, documents, documents, documents. I ventured to pull out my German rather than Russian, and I think I made the right decision, you know. In the middle of \u0152 of \u0152 of \u0152 of looking at my \u0152 checking my document, the child starts crying. And some way that tension was deflected, and I was da \u0152 I \u0152 I think it was a sheer \u0152 sheer luck for me, you know. And they just only ask me where I travel, and I said \u0152 I knew right town and [indecipherable] . So why do you come [indecipherable] . And I said a few words in German, you know, and \u0152 and my worries were over. They came to the \u0152 almost to the border. We co me off . Then he said to me, no, we have to go now. We have to walk now for about two Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 133 kilometers, because there is a place where I will always go through, but there is a very little where \u0152 sometimes even \u0152 they don't have even a guard on the border. Because you see, it\u2122s not a natural border, now where they \u0152 which they had \u0152 when they made later , in the later years, like when they \u0152 when they had the air supply, Berlin, and th-that was much more difficult to escape now. But in 1947, was still \u0152 you know, it was still at a point where the war was still \u0152 I mean, they were still not \u0152 not so organized now. And I remember when we crossed \u0152 I mean, there \u0152 we heard some shots on the other side [indecipherable] but it was not relevant. We crossed and there were \u0152 not the last, there were quite a few people who \u0152 who crossed. Apparently, this was the place where we crossed the border. And there was a big sign that said, you are entering the British Zone of occupation. If you have some armaments, or some illegal \u0152 illegal items, the kommandantur is here, here, and here. You have to immediate identify yourself and deliver that to the kommandantur . I kissed the ground when I found myself in this. And then I \u0152 I pulled out, the first thing, I-I threw my pistol and I said, the hell with that, I was going to throw \u0152 this guy grabs me by the hand, he says, what is that? I didn\u2122t know you were armed, he said to me. I said, why not? And he said, it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s completely prohibited. You cannot have arms. I mean, it\u2122 s \u0152 it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s against \u0152 I mean, it\u2122s against the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the terms, you know. So who are you? What ha \u0152 you Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 134 are not a smuggler like you told me. I said, no, no, I\u2122m sorry to tell you, but I\u2122m a Russian officer. He says, you\u2122re crazy. How come you didn't tell me? I say, b ecause I didn't feel it was irrel \u0152 relevant to tell you. He said, g ive me, give me. Let me see the pistol. I said \u0152 he say [indecipherable] , took it, he says, you know what, I\u2122m going to bury that right here. When I come back, I\u2122ll take it. It\u2122 s worth \u0152 it\u2122s worth 500 dollars, he say, that\u2122s \u0152 this is so beautiful. This \u0152 this is real \u0152 real elephant bone handle. I mean, that\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s worth a fortune. I said, you can have it. You need some marks? I told him, you have here marks also, because they are useless here. Because I had \u0152 I had the Russian occupation \u0152 I mea n, the German occupational marks, which belong to the \u0152 on the Russian border \u0152 on the \u0152 the \u0152 the Russian zone, not the \u0152 the \u0152 the British and the American zone had different \u0152 different marks, you know. So I gave it to him and then we went to \u0152 from there we went to Bremen . In Bremen , we slept in the \u0152 in the railroad station. I red \u0152 I had my knapsack and my \u0152 my boots were my \u0152 my pillow . I was so happy. From there I had to go to Bergen -Belsen , which was in the vicinity, because there I had my contact. So I went to Bergen -Belsen , spend there a night. And then I found the man that\u2122s supposed to take me back to \u0152 take me to Munich . And then I came to Munich , my friend was ecstatic. He had a little, tinyminey room, you know, big as my closet here. And he says, we can share it, I mean, you can stay here. And for the Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 135 first time, I had a good meal, you know. Fantastic, you know, sa y \u0152 with some American products, and some other thing. I forgot to mention to you that when we were in the \u0152 in Berlin , I had to mention to you something very important, that I \u0152 I overlooked something. Being in Berlin , we had a \u0152 I had a special mission. I don't know how many people are aware, but I-I don't think too many are aware of that. I\u2122m going to tell you that they \u0152 they have transplanted factories from Berlin to some \u0152 they \u0152 they used to take them to different parts of Russia . So I was assigned a mission with a truck with three soldiers to go to \u0152 they have \u0152 taking out the IG Farben company from Berlin, and they are supposed to be shipped to Leningrad to dismantle completely. Not only dismantle, wh at they have \u0152 our assignment was to take the workers, including even the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the lowest paid guy, like, the \u0152 the \u0152 the guy that cleans the factory. Everybody had to be placed on a train by five o\u2122clock in the morning. And we used to come with a truck and come to the house and knock on the door and say, out in five minutes. Sei haben five minute n. So you have five minutes to \u0152 to get your belongings and \u0152 and out on the car. This was such a pleasure, this task that I had. Of course, it was nothing compared to what they have done to me. But it was, I \u0152 I cer \u0152 I found a certain \u0152 although, I didn\u2122t have anything against the \u0152 against the guys, those guys that worked there in the factory, no. Now, this \u0152 this factory, for a fact, they were so organized \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 136 the Russians were so organi \u0152 disorganized, that it took them X amount of months to reach the destiny for the factory. And then they found out that part of the factory went to one place, to Smolensk and the other one went to Leni ngrad. And tha-that was the what \u0152 what the \u0152 but if that \u0152 what th \u0152 I had to mention that, because that was a very, very unique experience, you know, whereby I \u0152 I was in charge of \u0152 of taking \u0152 I mean, to \u0152 disassembling and taking those people to the train station at five o\u2122clock, and \u0152 and it \u0152 it was a \u0152 a remarkable \u0152 you know, sometimes you remember certain \u0152 c ertain \u0152 so okay, so wh-when I came \u0152 when I came to Munich , I \u0152 it happened to be those people that I used to send packages. Those relatives were in Feldafing ."

So I stayed couple days in Prather\u2122s home, and then he took me to Feldafing , because they are \u0152 they\u2122re relatives. And this lady, Fruma (ph) Lankavich (ph), she went out her way to accommodate me and to \u0152 and to \u0152 and to help me out. And what \u0152 what I wanted basically is to \u0152 to get \u0152 get out from Germany and go to \u0152 to Cuba . So there was \u0152 I asked her \u0152 from there, I wrote already freely, you know, to \u0152 to Cuba , and they \u0152 they send me some \u0152 they send me letters , and they send me also a letter saying that they have \u0152 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 137 they instituted a visa in \u0152 in \u0152 in fr \u0152 in Paris , to go to \u0152 I mean to \u0152 in order to come to Cuba. Now, how do you go to Paris ? I don\u2122 t have any \u0152 any \u0152 any documents. So I start working on documents. In the meantime, a guy came by and he said that he is \u0152 he\u2122s capable to \u0152 you know, we\u2122re very desperate, you know. The time was now important to \u0152 to get out. I mean, we just wanted to reach already a destiny, after so many pain and suffering. So we had \u0152 the guy said that for a hundred dollars, he is going to make me false papers to travel to France . So I \u0152 I found a \u0152 a \u0152 a friend of \u0152 of the family, with the name of Bernard Picard (ph), who also in Kovno ghetto. And he was a brigadier, the other brigade, Bernard Picard (ph). And he le \u0152 he lend me the \u0152 the hundred dollars. And I gave it to the guy and he made me this paper, it didn\u2122t look to me good, but I figured he \u0152 he \u0152 he knows what he\u2122s doing. But through the train, we went to Strasbourg , and through Saargebiet, you know. And when we came to France , the S\u00fbret\u00e9 came o ut, the French police took us off anan d \u0152 and sent \u0152 was going to send us back. And I \u0152 I got very, very scared so I took out certain things that I had from the Russians and I just flushed it down the toilet, you know. Because I figured maybe they are goi ng to send me back to the [indecipherable] \u0152 you know, that time you were fearful, you didn\u2122t know. They might send you back to \u0152 to your destiny, where you \u0152 you were coming from. So then I came back to \u0152 to Feldafing , and we start working legally . Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 138 And she helped me so much, this Fruma (ph). Fortunately, they went later to Canada , and she\u2122s passed away now. So then \u0152 then I was able to \u0152 I got \u0152 I got already the \u0152 the real papers went to France , and then there I had my visa. I spent in France a few days, and then I found out, in order to go to United States \u0152 to Cuba , I have to go through United States and I need a visa. This is eight months. You had to wait for eight months for \u0152 to get \u0152 to get a visa to United States . So I started \u0152 I had all \u0152 I found also a other guy that was going to Cuba , by the name \u0152 same name like me, Abraham , but his name was Rabi nowitz (ph). And he told me, wherever you go, I go with you. I said, fine. So I start walking up and down in \u0152 in France, in Paris, and \u0152 and looking. I spoke a little English, you know, it was easier for me because he didn\u2122t. And I start looking. Finally, I found \u0152 we found a maiden flight of a six-motor hydroplane from Air France, that was going to Dakar , Africa, and Port-\u00c9tienne . And from there \u0152 and to \u0152 from Dakar to Port-\u00c9tienne . So we \u0152 what I did is, we had our tickets from Pan American . We exchanged that, and the company, they gave us credit and some way we hustled around and \u0152 and all \u0152 all togeth \u0152 and all together, what we had was 10 dollars in our pocket. Then we took the trip with this six-motor hid \u0152 hydroplane and it took us \u0152 it was an incredible flight , you know . They gave us champagne and we felt like kings already there. And then when we came to \u0152 to Port -\u00c9tienne , we had to go to Antigua \u0152 British Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 139 Antigua . So from there, we went \u0152 we had to take a boat and go there, to British Antigua . And then from British Antigua , we found out that in order to go to Cuba , we need still an American transit visa because we have to stay in Puerto Rico, which is an American \u0152"

            "answer": "Yes. This \u0152 this is is precisely \u0152 I have a book of that which I have not had a chance to \u0152 to read. The \u0152 the Ninth Fort was one of the most vicious and criminal places in \u0152 in the \u0152 Lithuania , whereby, most of the \u0152 most of the inmates from \u0152 from the camps were taken, and \u0152 taken . And it was \u0152 we had few forts, but the Ninth Fort was the \u0152 was the one that\u2122s for \u0152 were the \u0152 that was best equipped to \u0152 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 141 to kill and also to dispose of the bodies. But you see, there were so many \u0152 so many people were killed \u0152 or murdered, not killed \u0152 at the Ninth Fort , that they didn\u2122 t have \u0152 didn\u2122t give them time to get rid of the bodies. So what they did is, they used to burn \u0152 they used to place them in \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 in rows, you know, one on top of the other one. But then, apparently towards at the end of 1943, there came a order from the Reichs command that it has to be something done in order to eliminate the bodies. So they were \u0152 they looked for a Sonderkommando , and they took a number of \u0152 of people and \u0152 of Jews from the \u0152 from \u0152 from the ghetto. And they had decided they had some other people, which they kept there for a long time. What they used to do with those people is, after they \u0152 after they did their \u0152 their dirty work, they used to kill them and then bring in some new people, you know, because they \u0152 they always tried to \u0152 to hide their tracks behind \u0152 and \u0152 and \u0152 and the evidence behind them. So they brought in this contingency of the Sonderkommando , and they were there for some time, and they \u0152 they tried to \u0152 they exhumed the \u0152 the bodies and they tried to burn them. And the way they did \u0152 they used to do that, they used to lay them in \u0152 in layers and \u0152 and put in wood in between and then pour gas and then \u0152 and the, of course, in the concentration camps they used crematoriums, which were more \u0152 mo re advanced technology. This, the y did it in more primitive way. And incidentally, I have some friends who are \u0152 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 142 especially one friend that send me now a book, that escaped, one of the escapees. I mean, this was an incredible, incredible escape, which is like escaping from Sing Sing , or for \u0152 whereby, they \u0152 they have plan. They knew that they are not going to last too long because after they burn, I mean, they are going to be one of those who are going to be burned also. So what they plotted is, they found themselves that they \u0152 they have, New Year\u2122s Eve, they have some way got some additional \u0152 additional liquor for the guards and they \u0152 when they were drunk, they traced \u0152 t hey had a map of the ninth \u0152 of the Ninth Fort and they \u0152 some way they were able t o escape and this was a escape like a large group of \u0152 of \u0152 of people was able to escape , you know.
