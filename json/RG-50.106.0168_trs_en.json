He knew that war was inevitable and by the time -- so Germany invaded Poland, we were already in this house in the country. In fact, we went there for the summer vacation. So that we were there, and I remember very, very clearly that Sunday morning on September third, when we sat round the -- at -- around the radio and -- and listened to Chamberlain telling us that we were at war. And so we decided to stay there. My school -- my sister had already graduate d, and she was actually going to become a lawyer; that never happened. She went to work and eventually she had to do the war service. And she was -- and she was sent to -- she was sent to a factory in Glasgow, and -- just 45 miles from Edinburgh and she used to work there -- she stayed with my aunt in Glasgow through the week and then come back at the weekends. I had one year to go in school. I was -- war was declared 10 days Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12, 2006 14after my 16th birthday. And I should have had one more year of school, and my school closed down. They closed down and evacuated to the north of Scotland.

They went to the village schools there, the three boys, my brother and the two refugee boys went to the village school there, and as I say, my schooling was finished. After two years we went back to Edinburgh. Edinburgh itself was not badly bombed, but Edinburgh is 45 miles from Glasgow and in Glasgow there was Clydeside -- Clydebank, which was the biggest shipping fact ory in the world. So the Germans used to come over practically every night to bomb the Clydeside, and in doing so they came over Edinburgh. So we never knew, and I think we had about 150 air raids and we never knew what was happ ening and we always knew the Germans planes because they had a missed beat. The British planes had a very steady beat, the Germans had a missed beat. You could hear them above and know what -- what they were.

It was a very, very sprawling farmhouse, and -- and th e domestics that we had all went to do war work, so they -- there we were in the country, my mother was an invalid, so I was looking after the house.

So the first thing I do was light the living room fire, light the kitchen fire, do these sort of things. I was looking after the house and I was -- I was very domesticated and I loved to -- I loved to cook, so that kept me busy. An d then when we went back -- back to Edinburgh , I was accepted into the -- the Edinburgh College of Domestic Science, and I was there for two years and I got degrees in household and institutional management. And institutional management meant that you learned to cook for many, many people. In fact, after I got marri ed, and with four boys, and my family used to tease me that I was still cooking for institutional management. And so I Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12, 2006 35graduated from there and then I was to ld that I had to do work of national importance. Well --"

            "answer": "Yes, possibly 1943. My sister was already away doing work of national importance, and I was told that I had to do this. Well, my mother needed somebody. We had a big house in Edinburgh , no staff. So they said that I could stay at home. Th-They wanted to make me what they ca lled a messing officer. This is a British phrase. A messing officer is a commissioned officer in the British forces that -- that deals with -- with -- with the catering, the cooking. Look ing after the troops. They wanted me to be a messing officer and they said that I could -- I could stay at home if I got a job of national importance. So I went to work for the Edinburgh\u2122s school system, sort of cooking meals for the schools -- for the Scottish schoolchildren. And what I did was this, I had to be there at six o\u2122clock in the morning and it was dark, it was blackout, there was no transportation. It was luckily about 15 minutes walk from where I lived. And I get -- I leave the house about five -- I\u2122d get up early, I would light the fires in our own house. I would wash the kitchen floor, do everything that had to be d one so my mother wouldn\u2122t do it. Then I\u2122d leave the house at 5:30, walk to my wo rk. And what we had to do is we had to work with the food, so that the food had to be ready by 8:30. Then it was put in insulated Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12, 2006 36containers and the trucks used to take it off at 8:30 to the various schools. And we were finished by three o\u2122clock. Well, after we sent the food out at 8:30, we began preparing the food for -- for the next day. And during that time I got a vaccination. They had smallpox in Glasgow, which came into Edinburgh . And -- and without telling my parents I went to have a vaccination, because for some reason I was not vaccinated as a child. So I went to -- I went to get a vaccination that was not good and I had a very -- a very swollen arm, and the doctor said, you\u2122re working too hard. So they put me in -- in the -- in the largest wartime nursery, it had a hun 150 children. And I used to go -- I used to get the -- the tram car by that time, to this nursery and I used to go there and I used to cook for the 150 children and for the staff. And it was -- it was an old -- it was an old church run by an -- and ran by an -- and ran by a canal. And there were -- there were rats and this sort of thing. And I remember one year -- I lliked to knit. One year I made about 20 or 30 pairs of mitts for the children, to th -- when -- for Christmas and one year they -- the Duchess -- the Duchess of Kent was going to come to visit. Great excitement. And I had managed to hold some white flour, wh ich was always, always unwrit -- unobtainable, and I made th is wonderful cake. I mean, I made this absolutely wonderful cake and took it in there and the next morning when the Duchess was supposed to come, they found out that the rats had eaten part of it. So this was a -- Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12, 2006 37this was an experience. So I worked th ere and actually where I should backtrack and say that when I went to work for the -- for the schools, after I was there for six months they say that would I be in charge of sending the food out to all the wartime nurseries in Edinburgh , which I did. I think there we re about 1500 children, and I used to send out the food to all these children. Then when I got this, the smallpox thing, I h -- I went to work for the largest nursery. And finally my mother\u2122s health deteriorated and they said that I could stay home. And that\u2122s when I started my volunteer work and I went to work -- I look ed after her and I went to work at the Canadian Legion Services club on Princess Street, which is the main street in Edinburgh. And my parent\u2122s house was always open house for everybody. I mean, when -- I mean, for Pesach , for Thanksgiving, any time. We always had lots of people and f-for our two Seders, -- we always had four or five or six servicemen. So we had open house and we always had many, many servicemen coming back, and it was very, very nice. I had a great -- I had a great childhood, really."

            "answer": "Well, the war finished in 1945, and unfortunately my father died very suddenly on the 19 th of June in 1945, just before V-E Day. He was only 59 years old, it was a great, great shock to us. My mother was very sick at the time and we went through a very, very sad time at that time. After th e war I became engaged to a man -- to a young man from Edinburgh, one who -- because we knew all of the families in Edinburgh , I had grown up with, I had seen him at the Jewish holidays and at the synagogue and I had been very friendly w ith -- with his sister, who went to the same school I did, and he went he joined the -- the British army during the war, he was a captain in the Royal Engineers and was stationed out in India. And he came back after the war and I met him at a -- at a Jewish charity dance, and we became engaged and married. And he was working for his mother, who was a furrier. Didn\u2122t work out so we decided to emigrate. And we ha -- by that time we had one little boy who was two years old, Lawrence, and my mother was desperately upset when we said we were going. She loved her first grandson. And I remember saying to her, don\u2122t worry, we\u2122ll come back and see you in two year\u2122s time. We got to -- well, that\u2122s another -- we -- we sailed on the -- on the first Queen Elizabeth. We sailed in Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12, 2006 64February, and these ships really rolled. It was a very, very stormy crossing and most of the passengers spent all of their time in their cabins. We -- she either lost or gained an hour each day, so we were five hours -- I\u2122m not sure if it\u2122s ahead or behind when we got to New York. We got to New York and I remember sailing up the Hudson and seeing the Statue of Liberty. We stayed there overnight and -- and a Jewish friend of ours who we befriended when-- he was in the American army, met us at the boat to go to our hotel, and then took us to his home for our first American meal. And his -- his wife was a daughter of a Jewish butcher, and she had prepared huge steaks for us, and we couldn't eat them. And she was very upset with us until we sort of explained we can\u2122t do this, you know? Anyway, the very next morning we got a taxi to LaGuardia airport and it was bitterly cold, that was -- the 28th of February I think it was, bitterly cold and as we got on the -- on the plane it -- they were -- they were brushing the snow off the wings. And I was terrified. We had a two year old child, we were going to California and I was absolutely terrified. My husband was promised a job as a furrier there, so we had to get there right away. We got on board plane and my son Lawrence started screaming and he screamed all the way to Chicago . In Chicago , all of the pay -- all of the passengers were told to get off to get boxed lunches, but by that time Lawrence had stopped screaming, he\u2122d fallen asleep, so we stayed onboard. And five hours later we got to Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12, 2006 65Los Angeles. When we got to Los Angeles it was 90 degrees and I almost died. I honestly almost died, I had never known such heat in my life. We had bought clothes in Edinburgh that was not suitable and we -- and we\u2122re met by this friend of ours and he took us to a motel in Studio City in the San Fernando Valley and left us there and the very next day so Jerry found out -- Jerry, my husband found out that the job that we\u2122d come for was no longer there. So he started looking around and he ended up by working in the film labs. He worked for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , he worked for Universal , this sort of thing. And we lived there for three and a half years and in these three and a half years I had two more sons. One was born - on July 13 th in one year, one was born August 13 th of the next year, they were 13 months apart. Well we didn\u2122t stay in Los Angeles because Jerry had very, very bad sinus trouble, so we packed up and drove to Denver, Denver, Colorado and we lived in Denver for 15 years. Worked out very well, our fourth son was born there and I love Denver, had a wonderful time there. And --"

            "answer": "Well, I\u2122m the perennial volunteer. I\u2122ve -- ever since World War II, I volunteered in some way or another all my life. I -- I volunteered for the Red Cross in Denver for about 15 years. I have thousands of hours there. I was head of Red Cross motor service. That\u2122s another story, but -- but I volunteered when we went to Tucson, Arizona, I volunteered in Saint Mary\u2122s Hospital for nine years. So I\u2122ve always volunteered, but when we came t -- when we came here, I thought, my goodness, the United States Memorial -- Holocaust Memorial Museum is here, could I possibly? And I thought I couldn\u2122t, becaus e there was the transportation. And we Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12, 2006 69went down, we saw the museum, we were totally overwhelmed, my husband and my son and I. And I called them and said , is there any way I could come? And I talked to Genya Marken . And she said well, we have a training class in October but, she said, if you want to come now, I\u2122m in the photo archives. So I went into -- I went in -- had an interview with her and she said -- she knew that I wasn\u2122t a survivor, she knew that I hadn\u2122t had anything drastic happen to me during the -- the war, yet she said, why do you want to do th is? And I said, because my parents were so involved and through them I was -- I became involved and I said, I\u2122d love to think that I\u2122m continuing to do what my pa rents were doing. And she said, well you know, you can\u2122t just come for a couple of hours. Eviden tly she had some volunteers that came in once a week for a couple of hours. She said, you\u2122d have to come and make a real investment in this. And I said, sure I will. And so I started, and because my husband volunteered at a school and need ed to be there by eight, he would drive me to the Metro station and I would get to the museum at seven o\u2122clock in the morning. And I had -- I had a special permis sion from the guards to go in there, and it was completely deserted, apart from the guards. And I woul d go up to the fifth floor, everything was quiet and everything was partly dark and I\u2122d walk across the glass bridge and go into the photo archives, and the first thing I do is put on everybody\u2122s computers. I knew all of their passwords so that they [indecipherable] Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12, 2006 70them. And then I would -- I worked to Sharon Muller and -- and -- and Teresa Pollik -- but at that -- Pollin, but that time was mainly Sharon Muller , and she was -- she was good to work with because she was very, very precise. Extremely precise, I mean, and -- and she was never too busy to answer my questions. I mean, there were always people coming through at photo archives, asking for things, all the [indecipherable] come in, and I could go over and say, Sharon, could I possibly ask you this and she would stop ev erything and tell me what to do. I mean, I\u2122m -- I felt that -- how I say, that I knew -- that I felt very confident what I did because she taught me how to do it. And I -- I worked there for six years. They called me their unpaid staff. I would go as -- I worked there four days a week, six hours a day. I\u2122d leave there at one o\u2122clock and Jerry would meet me. And I did so much. I think one of the things that I\u2122m very, very proud of is that I did -- I processed the Auschwitz collection. That\u2122s a collection of 2400 photographs that were found in a suitcase, and this lady -- I can\u2122t remember her -- her second name, but she found them. Anyway, they had it in -- in Israel and we asked them if we could have this collection and there wa s a lot of negotiating going on with Sharon Muller and Teresa Pollin and th-this lady Ann, I can\u2122t remember her second name. Anyway, she came and she said that if we made copies for her that we -- that we could have -- we could make copies for our selves also. So we got the negatives and Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12, 2006 71I remember Sharon and Teresa talking themselves one day and saying, do you think Hilda would like to do it? So they asked me and I said yeah. I ha -- I think so. So I did this whole thing. I had the contac t prints, I had negatives, I did -- put this whole thing together. There were 2400 phot ographs, I put them by category, by this, and everything else. And I got so involved with it. They were ma -- they were mainly from people who had lived in a place called Bedzin in Poland and it was near the -- near a mountain resort. And it was the saddest thing because here were these pictures of these -- these photographs and there are people who -- who are leading happy lives before the Holocaust. There were pe -- there were weddings, there were -- there were picnics, there were family outings and there were a lot of -- lot of photographs of school -- school gr oups, a-and they were -- they were the Jewish -- what do they call them?

But there\u2122s something very, very Scottish about me, and I love to hear the bagpipes. I get so homesick. And a -- a funny story that I will tell you is that a friend of mine told me that she had a fri end who plays the bagpipes in the American Air Force Bagpipe Band, of all things. And she said, he would like to meet you. So she brought him here one evening, with his bagpipes. Now this is a -- this is a townhouse association and -- and -- and ther e are neighbors on the side. He brought out his bagpipes and started to play. No w, you know how loud they are. My -- my son at the time was the president of the homeowner\u2122s association. I could see him literally getting paler by the minute. But it was great. I mean, I mean I can have tears in my eyes when I hear the bagpipes. It brings back so much to me. I absolutely love it.

            "answer": "Yes, at Whittingehame, my parents loved being there and they were very, very surprised when they were invited to go out one special evening and they -- because they didn\u2122t usually get an i nvitation, we went out and that was fine and they -- the staff said no [indecipherable] come out tonight, could you possibly come, and we said okay. So we came out and -- and -- and I\u2122m not sure how many of this -- of the children were there, if they were all there or not, I don\u2122t remember that, but one of them got up and made a speech and said that they had worked on something very special as a gift for my parents and they were going to present it to them. And the brought out this absolutely beautiful menorah that they had carved by themselves and written in Hebrew on it. It was about three foot across, and -- and made of beautiful wood, and they said that they would like us to have it and -- in appreciation for all that we had done for them. Well, we took -- my par -- my father was a very quiet man who wa -- had a very soft heart and when he\u2122s touched and the tears came to his eyes, and he said something appropriate, I\u2122m not sure what he Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12, 2006 81said. But we took it home and we used it every year and it was on our -- on our sideboard at home every year that I remember. Then I was the first of the family to leave the country and when I left my mother was still alive, and there was the menorah. And then after that my sister left and the last person to leave was my brother. And we didn\u2122t know, evidently he brought everything he could. And he is no longer alive, but his wife lives in San Francisco -- very, very fond of her. And about three months ago she called me and said she was cleani ng up her garage and she said that she found this wooden thing in the corne r, would I know what it was and would I be interested in it? And she expl -- she described it and I said, oh my God, Pat, I said that\u2122s the menorah . And I said, don\u2122t -- don\u2122t get rid of it. I said, would you consider giving it to the museum? And she said, well, she said, I don\u2122t see why not. She says, I\u2122ll ask my two children. One of them is in Edinburgh just now, one of them was with her. So she asked her two children, Mandy and David and they said -- they didn\u2122t know much ab out the museum, but they s -- and I said, you know what, I\u2122m going to send you some information. So I sent them all the pamphlets, all the documents I had. And she said, yes, of course we\u2122ll give it to the museum. And she said, if it\u2122s all ri ght with you, I\u2122ll donate it with David and Mandy\u2122s names. So the U.S. -- the museum\u2122s -- a conservatory group came out to her very early one morning, they packed it up, they brought it back here and it is Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12, 2006 82now in the museum. And -- and it really doe s my heart good to know that it\u2122s there and that something that was given to my parents will always be there for them."

Did it make you feel more Jewish or did it not have any effe ct on that aspect of your life?",
            "answer": "Oh, I think it definitely made me more aware of who I was an-and -- and -- and of being Jewish. We ourselves didn\u2122t encounter any -- any animosity or any anti Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12, 2006 83Semitism, but coming over here I realized that there were -- that there was more anti-Semitism over in Great Britain than I\u2122d realized, and that people were not so -- so willing to wear a Mogen David, or wear some -- something to show that they were Jewish. And I found it -- it\u2122s a much more open society here when I came over here. So while we had -- we had absolutely no -- no sort of contact with anything that made us feel that w-we were unwelcome or anything, I know that there was that there. And we were very, very -- I mean, we were very, very proud of being Jewish, and as I say, we were the only Jewish ch ildren, the five of us, in our school, and -- and we felt kind of important because of it.

I mean, I talk about refugees -- the refugees, I talk about the Kindertransport , I talk about Whittingehame, but there were so many other peopl e that they helped in every way they could, I mean, they were just kind, kind people that -- that just were always out for other people.

Edinburgh is a much bigger and more of a cosmopolitan Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12, 2006 84town than it is -- than it was when I lived there. There was no trans-Atlantic flights, there were no tourists there. It was a very, very quiet city. It was all -- it was almost a sleepy city, not like it is now.

But -- and his parents did take a refu -- one of the 35 ch ildren and I hate to say this, but I th -- I have a feeling that my mother-in-law treated this little girl more of a domestic. But Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12, 2006 88anyway, the thing was this, that we went to -- we went to Europe in the 1980\u2122s, and we went through France, and Belgium and -- and the Netherlands and got to Luxembourg, and then we drove to the German border. And it\u2122s a beautiful area, aand we could see -- and we could see a castle in the di stance, and I said, let\u2122s go over. He said, I can\u2122t.

So I mean, he had much deeper feelings than he\u2122d ever, ever, you know. But yes, my feelings about sort of, Germany, have changed. I don\u2122t know -- I have mixed feelings about it because in one of Leon Yuris\u2122s books, he tries to explain this make-up of a German, the physiology and all [indecipherable] and I believed him -- him completely, but as I say, I\u2122ve been in contact with couple of people recently, and one in particular, and they are lovely people.

And I -- and she I think lived in somewhere like Essen or something that was terribly badly bombed and they went out sort of looking for pot -- sort of scraping for potatoes, they were so hungry. She was telling me all this [indecipherable] she says, you know? And I say, look, you can\u2122t go back and -- a nd -- everybody had problems. But I think it made me realize that -- I mean I-- myself, I could never understand -- I could never Interview with Hilda Seftor June 12, 2006 89understand how the German people could not see what was going on. How they couldn't see that the -- their neighbors we re all disappearing. I mean, this could never be explained to me. But it\u2122s a new generation and I think that the German schools, that they\u2122re bending over backwards to teach the children. And I -- they say at one time the Japanese were taking this whole thing out of their -- out of the history books, it just didn\u2122t happen. But th e Germans are bending over backwards to make sure that they understand what -- what went on. And of course they still have their -- their anti-Semites, and th -- and their -- their Nazis with their -- with their armbands on, but listen, we all have them.
