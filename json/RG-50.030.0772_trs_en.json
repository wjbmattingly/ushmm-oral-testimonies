And I started a boatbuilding school to ha-have something for the kids at Alexandria and Washington \u2014 whole Washington area to do. And we \u2014 we \u2014 it really took off, I was amazed at that. You know, wh-when I went to set it up, I talked to the city council, and they weren\u2019t very interested. I went and talked to the school board, ah, you\u2019re wasting your time, they said, your kids don\u2019t want to do anything like that, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection =n Interview with William Hunley February 21, 2014 they want to play in the streets and all. But I\u2014 I persisted and I got the school started in 1992, and I started off with a\u2014 a group of 15 little kids that were 12 - 14 years old, and had a group of neighborhood supporters that would support them. And they all came in and we split them up into groups of five kids, with at least one adult with each group, so that they had some good supervision. I started them building little wooden boats. And I \u2014 we found that boy, when \u2014 when a lot of \u2014 most of those kids \u2014 most of them when they came, they were \u2014 boats didn\u2019t mean anything at all to them. And doing anything with their hands didn\u2019t mean to them. They didn\u2019t di \u2014 they\u2019d never done anything. But when they came in to us, about a week of working on a little boat that was going to be theirs when they finished, as long as they could actually do something, man, the effect was amazing. So that\u2019s gone on since \u201992 and it just kept on growing, it\u2019s national now. A-As our system that we developed has been spread all over the country, and now a hundred, 185 organizations in the country that use our system, teaching kids to build little wooden boats. The little wooden boat is \u2014 is the key to it. They come in, and they get started with hammer and \u2014 and chisels and saws, things they had never touched before, and they learn to use those things, and they start building a little boat that they can see, I can do something that\u2019s going to last and will be good for me \u2014"

I was very interested in \u2014 in the colonial crafts. I trava \u2014 I\u2019m a gunsmith and make furniture, and all that kind of stuff. So I used to go to Waterford and go \u2014 go there for the fair every year, and got to working with some of the craftsman up there on Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 3 Interview with William Hunley February 21, 2014 different things. So I\u2014 we got \u2014 both of us got so interested in it that we watched for a \u2014 a lot that we could buy, we were looking for a house, really. But we \u2014 none of the houses came up for sale that we could \u2014 could ha \u2014 could handle. So a lot came up for sale, so we bought the lot, 1968, and then we started drawing back \u2014 I started making designs for houses. And, of course, in Waterford they had all \u2014 had all kinds of restrictions on what you could build because they wanted to keep the tenor of the village. So I designed what I thought was a real [indecipherable] house, and I took it to the [indecipherable] took it to the \u2014 the architect who was the [indecipherable] on what you could build. Showed it to him, he said, oh, that\u2019s a nice little house Bill, but that \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that would look beautiful in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, but that\u2019s not for Waterford. So I went back, and I designed a brick house. Oh, he said, man, Williamsburg. Beautiful Williamsburg house. Not for Waterford. So about that time, my wife was reading [indecipherable] the \u201cWashington Post,\u201d and at the bottom end of the classified ads was, log house for sale. They were tearing down a log house because they built \u2014 had new houses all around it, they \u2014 they couldn\u2019t do anything except tear \u2014 tear down and move it. So we went over \u2014 she said, let\u2019s go over and take a look at it. Well, that was the first week in May, 1970. And I said, oh, I\u2019m too busy, I can\u2019t take \u2014 make it. So next week she tried again. The house was still for sale. Third Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection \u00ab4 Interview with William Hunley February 21, 2014 week, still for sale, tried again. The fourth week, Sunday \u2014 Sunday afternoon, it was raining cats and dogs, the kids were grumpy as all get out. Said okay, let\u2019s take the kids over, we\u2019ll go look at it. So we went over and there\u2019s this log house. By that time they\u2019d taken the roof off, and it was raining for all week, and water dripping on everything. We opened the back door, and the inside of the house had been lone \u2014 had been lined with [indecipherable] board, you know, this fabulous tan, soft fiber, insulating board? And when we opened the back door there was enough [indecipherable] that the whole ceiling collapsed, and two tons of water and all frazzly wood came down. But it opened up everything so I could see all the logs. And it was in good shape. Only two logs needed some \u2014 some moderate repairs. So right there we bought the log house, and we [indecipherable] hire a guy to haul the logs over to our lot to Waterford so we could rebuild it. And he started loading up the logs, he says, hey, you know, my father\u2019s got a log house three miles over there, that he hasn\u2019t used for 10 years, he\u2019d probably sell that to you, if you wanted it. So [indecipherable] that was very reasonable, so I bought that and they moved both of them over, and we combined the two of them to make one house in Waterford. And we finished it [indecipherable] lived in it to the point where we lived in it about 1975. And we had \u2014 still had floors missing, and no doors or windows installed, things like that, but we moved 1n in time for the kids to go to school in the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection \u00ab Interview with William Hunley February 21, 2014 fall, and then I built it up from the inside.
