And I started a boatbuilding school to ha-hav e something for the kids at Alexandria and Washington \u0152 whole Washington area to do. And we \u0152 we \u0152 it really took off, I was amazed at that. You know, wh-when I went to set it up, I talked to the city council, and they weren\u2122t very interested. I went and talked to the school board, ah, you\u2122re wasting your time, they said, your kids don\u2122t want to do anything like that, Interview with William Hunley February 21, 2014 57they want to play in the streets and all. But I \u0152 I persisted and I got the school started in 1992, and I started off with a \u0152 a group of 15 little kids that were 12 - 14 years old, and had a group of neighborhood supporters that would support them. And they all came in and we split them up into groups of five kids, with at least one adult with each group, so that they had some good supervision. I started them building little wooden boats. And I \u0152 we found that boy, when \u0152 when a lot of \u0152 most of those kids \u0152 most of them when they came, they were \u0152 boats didn\u2122t mean anything at all to them. And doing anything with their hands di dn\u2122t mean to them. They didn\u2122t di \u0152 they\u2122d never done anything . But when they came in to us, about a week of working on a little boat that was going to be theirs when they finished, as long as they could actually do something, man, the effect was amazing. So that\u2122s gone on since \u212292 and it just kept on growing, it\u2122s national now. A-As our system that we developed has been spread all over the country, and now a hundred, 185 organizations in the country that use our system, teaching kids to build little wooden boats. The little wooden boat is \u0152 is the key to it. They come in, and they get started with hammer and \u0152 and chisels and saws, th ings they had never touched before, and they learn to use those things, and they start building a little boat that they can see, I can do something that\u2122s going to last and will be good for me \u0152"

I was very interested in \u0152 in the colonial crafts. I trava \u0152 I\u2122m a gunsmith and make furniture, and all that kind of stuff. So I used to go to Waterford and go \u0152 go there for the fair every year, and got to working with some of the craftsman up there on Interview with William Hunley February 21, 2014 63different things. So I \u0152 we got \u0152 both of us got so interested in it that we watched for a \u0152 a lot that we could buy, we were l ooking for a house, really. But we \u0152 none of the houses came up for sale that we could \u0152 could ha \u0152 could handle. So a lot came up for sale, so we bought the lot, 1968, and then we started drawing back \u0152 I started making designs for houses . And, of course, in Waterford they had all \u0152 had all kinds of restrictions on what you could bu ild because they wanted to keep the tenor of the village. So I designed what I thought was a real [indecipherable] house, and I took it to the [indecipherable] took it to the \u0152 the architect who was the [indecipherable] on what you could build. Showed it to him, he said, oh, that\u2122s a nice little house Bill, but that \u0152 that\u2122s \u0152 that would look beautiful in Lancaster County , Pennsylvania , but that\u2122s not for Waterford. So I went back, and I designed a brick house. Oh, he said, man, Williamsburg. Beautiful Williamsburg house. Not for Waterford. So about that time, my wife was reading [indecipherable] the \ufb01Washington Post,\ufb02 and at the bottom end of the classified ads was, log house for sale. They were tearing down a log house because they built \u0152 had new houses all around it, they \u0152 they couldn\u2122t do anything except tear \u0152 tear down and move it. So we went over \u0152 she said, let\u2122s go over and take a look at it. Well, that was the first week in May, 1970. And I said, oh, I\u2122m too busy, I can\u2122t take \u0152 make it. So next week she tried again. The house was still for sale. Third Interview with William Hunley February 21, 2014 64week, still for sale, tried again. The fourth week, Sunday \u0152 Sunday afternoon, it was raining cats and dogs, the kids were grumpy as all get out . Said okay, let\u2122s take the kids over, we\u2122ll go look at it. So we went over and there\u2122s this log house. By that time they\u2122d taken the roof off, and it was raining for all week, and water dripping on everything. We opened the back door, and th e inside of the house had been lone \u0152 had been lined with [indecipherable] board, you know, this fabulous tan, soft fiber, insulating board? And when we open ed the back door there was enough [indecipherable] that the whole ceiling collapsed, and two tons of water and all frazzly wood came down. But it opened up everything so I could see all the logs. And it was in good shape. Only two logs needed some \u0152 some moderate repairs. So right there we bought the log house, and we [indecipherable] hire a guy to haul the logs over to our lot to Waterford so we could rebuild it. And he started loading up the logs, he says, hey, you know, my father\u2122s got a log house three miles over there, that he hasn\u2122t used for 10 years, he\u2122d prob ably sell that to you, if you wanted it. So [indecipherable] that was very reasonable, so I bought that and they moved both of them over, and we combined the two of them to make one house in Waterford. And we finished it [indecipherable] lived in it to the point where we lived in it about 1975. And we had \u0152 still had floors missing, and no doors or windows installed, things like that, but we moved in in time for the kids to go to school in the Interview with William Hunley February 21, 2014 65fall, and then I built it up from the inside. So that\u2122s how \u0152 that\u2122s how we got into that."
