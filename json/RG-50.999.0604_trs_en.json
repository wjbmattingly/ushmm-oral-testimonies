My name is Bill Benson. | am the host of the museum's public program, First Person.\nThank you for joining us today. We are in our 18th year of First Person. Our First Person today\nis Mr. Marcel Drimer, whom you shall meet shortly.\nThis 2017 season of First Person is made possible by the generosity of the Louis\nFranklin Smith Foundation, with additional funding from the Arlene and Daniel Fisher\nFoundation. We are grateful for their sponsorship.\nFirst Person is a series of conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share\nwith us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each of our First\nPerson guests serves as a volunteer here at this museum. The museum's website, at\nwww.ushmm.org, provides information about each of our upcoming First Person guests.\nMarcel will share with us his \"First Person\" account of his experience during the\nHolocaust for about 45 minutes. If time allows, we will have an opportunity for you to ask\nMarcel questions. The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are\nabout to hear from Marcel is one individual's account of the Holocaust.\nMarcel Drimer was born in Drohobycz, Poland, a small town now part of Ukraine. The\narrow on this map of Europe from 1933 points to Poland. Marcelle's father, Jacob, worked as\nan accountant in a lumber factory while his mother raised Marcelle and his younger sister,\nlrine.\nIn this photo we see Marcelle and his mother, Laura, in 1934.\nGermany and the Soviet Union attacked Poland in September 1939, beginning World\nWar Il. This is an historical photograph of German troops parading through Warsaw after the\nsurrender of Poland.\nOn June 22, 1941, Germany violated the German-Soviet pact and attacked Soviet\nterritory. Within a few weeks Drohobycz was occupied by German forces. In 1942, members of\nMarcel's family, including his grandfather, whom we see here, were deported to extermination\ncamps where they were murdered.\nIn the fall of 1942, Marcel and his family were forced into the Drohobycz ghetto. This is\nan historical photograph of Jews being forced into the Drohobycz ghetto.Before the liquidation\nof the ghetto, the family escaped to a small village.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n2\nIn August 1943, Marcel went into hiding with a Polish-Ukrainian family. Here we see\nphotos of Jan Sawinski and Zofia Sawinski, the family who hid Marcel and his family.\nMarcel's family is seen in this photo taken in 1947 or 1948. From left to right we see\nMarcel's uncle, Abraham Drimer, his parents, Laura and Jacob, and Marcel's uncle, Abraham\nGruber.\nIn 1957, Marcel earned a degree in mechanical engineering. He immigrated to the\nUnited States in 1961 where his wife Ania joined him in 1963. Soon after arrival in the U.S. he\nwas hired by the U.S. Post Office Department to work on the design of mail sorters and\nconveyors. After a very successful period with the Post Office Department, Marcel transferred\nto the U.S. Army as a civilian in 1972. He then worked as a mechanical engineer for the Army\nCorps of Engineers. Although Marcel officially retired from the Army in 1994, he remained a\nconsultant with the Army until 2010. He is now truly retired.\nAnia trained as a pharmacist in Poland and continued her profession after her arrival\nin the U.S. and is now also retired. Marcel and Ania have a son Adam who lives in Richmond.\nThey have two grandchildren, Mary, age 15, and Jack, who is 17. They are both in the\nInternational Baccalaureate program.\nAlthough officially Marcel and Ania are retired, they both do considerable work as\nvolunteers with the museum. Marcel and Ania translate documents written in Polish. They\ntranslated portions of Emanuel Ringelblum's Notes from the Warsaw Ghetto, a 25,000-page\ncollection of diaries and other documents detailing the events and lives of those who lived in\nthe doomed Warsaw Ghetto. They also recently translated personal memoirs by two Jewish\nyoung women who suffered terribly during the war. In appreciation for the translations, the\nfamilies of these women donated generously to this museum.\nMarcel and Ania also worked on the current museum exhibit titled, \"Some Were\nNeighbors: Collaboration and Complicity in the Holocaust,\" which opened in 2013. To help with\nthe exhibit, they reviewed and transcribed several filmed testimonies and made\nrecommendations about their potential significance to the exhibit. They are quite a team.\nMarcel speaks publicly about his Holocaust experience in various settings. He was a\nspeaker with Mia Farrow at an event in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and spoke to cadets from\nour four military academies who were on their way to visit Auschwitz. Marcel also speaks to\nstudents and faculty at universities and federal agencies including the FBI just a couple of\nweeks ago.\nMarcel recently donated photographs of great significance to him as well as a ring\nwhich played a role in his survival, which we will hear more about later. And we hope to hear\nabout a trip Marcel and Ania took to his home town of Drohobycz last year.\nPlease join me in welcoming our First Person, Mr. Marcel Drimer.\n>> [Applause]\n>> Bill Benson: Thank you all for being here. And Marcel, thank you for being with us today\nand for your willingness to be our First Person today. We have such a short period and you\nhave so much to share with us. We will cover what we can and get started.\nWorld War II began in September 1939, when Germany attacked Poland from the\nwest followed quickly by the Soviet Union attacking from the east. Early in the war you and\nyour family lived under Russian occupation. But before we turn to that time, before we turn to\nthe war and the Holocaust, tell us just a little bit about your family and your community before\nthe war began.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n3\n>> Marcel Drimer: My family consisted of my father, mother, and younger sister, Irine. And my\nfather was the oldest of five siblings. My mother was the oldest of four siblings. My father was\nan accountant, as you said earlier, at the lumber factory. And we lived above the offices. We\nused the lumber factory as our playground, my sister and I.\nDrohobycz was basically known for oil --\n>> Bill Benson: Big refineries.\n>> Marcel Drimer: Right. As a matter of fact, one of my grandfathers worked in the refinery.\nDrohobycz was the biggest producer of gasoline in the beginning of the 20th Century. So this\nwas the industry.\nAbout the people, Drohobycz was a town of three nationalities living in peace:\nUkrainians, Pols, and Jews, about 16,000, 17,000 each of these groups. People had their own\nsports clubs. | had an uncle who was a good soccer player. | remember watching him and\nscreaming, Uncle, Uncle. This was my mother's youngest brother. He was a wonderful person.\nAnd the Jews had their buildings there, theaters, clubs. And so did the Ukrainians in\ntheir own language and so did the Pols. The Jews had even a high school that was a Jewish\nhigh school. Life was good. We didn't know really what we missed because | only realized that\nwhen | came to America. But we were happy at that time.\n>> Bill Benson: That, of course, was about to change. On September 17, 1939, Russia\nattacked Poland. As a result, you would live under Russian occupation until June of 1941.\nWhat was that time like when you were under the Russians until June of 1941?\n>> Marcel Drimer: About one-third of Poland was occupied by the Russians. They tried to\nmake -- at that time they tried to make that part of Poland like one of the republics of the Soviet\nUnion. They nationalized factories, big buildings. They kicked out people that they considered\nenemies of their state. They sent them to Siberia. Among these people were the parents of my\nwife. They were not -- well, the father was a doctor and mother was a lawyer. The Soviets\ndidn't trust people that were very smart.\n>> Bill Benson: They considered them bourgeois.\n>> Marcel Drimer: Yes. They didn't want to accept Soviet passport so they were sent to Siberia\nwhere my wife was born.\n>> Bill Benson: And Ania is right in the front row.\n>> Marcel Drimer: Her father delivered her and they survived there. We in Drohobycz knew\nwhat was going on in the western part of Poland. So when the Germans attacked Poland\nlater -- I'm getting a little ahead.\n>> Bill Benson: Just a couple more questions. Since you were under the Russians, some of\nyour uncles even joined the Russian Army. Is that right?\n>> Marcel Drimer: Well, they didn't join. They were drafted.\n>> Bill Benson: Drafted. Ok.\n>> Marcel Drimer: Yeah. Well, most of my uncles were drafted to the Russian Army. They\nfought against the Germans. Two of them were killed but the others survived. Those that were\ndeported or ran with the Russian Army whether the Germans attacked, about 80% -- about\n90% survived.\n>> Bill Benson: Those who went with the Russians.\n>> Marcel Drimer: It wasn't a picnic but it was -- it was a very hard life but they survived. But\nthose that stayed under the German occupation, about 95% perished.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n4\n>> Bill Benson: One more question about that period. Your birth date, May 1, I'd like to ask you\n-- it's a significant date in the Communist world. Tell us about the significance of that date for\nyou because of your birthday.\n>> Marcel Drimer: Well, | just turned 83 on May 1, so it's an important date. My father had two\nsisters who were members of the Communist Party of Poland. My father was sort of leaning in\nthat direction. May 1 was a holiday, a Labor Day. So | was born in my grandparents\u2019 house. A\ndoctor came there and delivered me and went away. And my father a couple of days later had\nto go to the authorities and report my birth. So he decided to -- | was actually born April 30 but\nmy father decided that maybe it's going to be nice if he would be born May 1, holidays and so\nforth. So | am born --\n>> Bill Benson: Officially May 1.\n>> Marcel Drimer: Don't tell anybody.\n>> [Laughter]\n>> Bill Benson: Marcel, soon after Germany turned on the Soviet Union in June of 1941, then,\nof course, German troops occupied Drohobycz and life for you and your family and the other\nJews in Drohobycz changed dramatically and tragically. Tell us what the Nazis did after they\ntook control of Drohobycz and what this meant for you and your family.\n>> Marcel Drimer: Yes. They started their hellish action July 1 and 2. Even before they came,\nthey contacted the Ukrainian nationalists, anti-Semites, and they told them the first few days\nyou will have the right to go to the Jewish homes and do whatever you want to.\nSo when they came, when the Germans came, bands of Ukrainian nationalists would\nrun through from house-to-house. They would beat people and grab what they wanted. Among\nothers, my maternal grandfather was beaten up. We couldn't take him to a hospital because\nthere was no hospitals for the Jews, so he died in 10 days.\n| had an aunt who was in the biggest university town, near Drohobycz. She was also\nkilled by the Germans. In that town about 5,000 Jews were killed the first few days. In\nDrohobycz, about 80 people were killed, among them my grandfather and about 600 were\nwounded. So on the first day, first day of German occupation, | lost my grandfather and an\naunt.\nBut what they did, what the Germans did, they had a big list of things what the Jews\ncannot do. What can do wasn't much but what they cannot do. Children were not allowed to go\nto school, Jewish children were not. Christian children were allowed to go through the fourth\ngrade because they were supposed to be the slave labor for Germans and they would need to\nknow some elementary, | think, and reading. But the Jews were to be killed so they didn't need\nany education.\nThey ordered Jews to wear an arm band with the Star of David on it. They established\na ration system that people could buy only or get food about up to 300-calories, which you\ncouldn't live on. And they also started aktion. After the first one it was just many, many like\nthat.\n>> Bill Benson: An aktion is action.\n>> Marcel Drimer: In German. I'm sorry. But there were aktions. This is when they would go to\nJewish homes and take whatever they wanted away. And the killing aktion, they would kill or\nsend people to the concentration -- extermination camp.\nI'll go back a little. When the robbers robbed my grandfather and almost killed him,\nthey took out photo albums, several photo albums, and shook out the photos into mud and\ntook the albums. After the war my father went there to look at what's left of the grandparent's\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n)\nhouse that was gone but a neighbor came and gave father a stack of photos which he picked\nup from mud.\n>> Bill Benson: Some of the photos that we saw?\n>> Marcel Drimer: Some of the photos you have seen here and Bill mentioned about the\ndonation. | donated all of these photos to the Holocaust Museum. They made me beautiful\ncopies. But all of these photos are in the Holocaust Museum. And if you Google my name, you\ncan see all of these photos.\nOk.\n>> Bill Benson: One of the things | know during that period that you want to tell us about, and\nthat is the early stages of the occupation before you were forced to go to the ghetto, you had\nhad a nanny before the war. Tell us about the significance of the visit you made to your nanny.\n>> Marcel Drimer: Yes. In my house, in my apartment, there were my two grandparents and\none aunt with two children whose husband was taken to the Russian Army. The grandparents\ncould not work, so they would stay with us. My father was the only one that was working. But\nhe managed to barter things for food. He would, for example, exchange a ring for two loafs of\nbread. So these people stayed with us and they -- you know, it was quite crowded.\n| had a nanny, her name was Jancia. | don't remember her last name. She loved me\nvery much and | loved her, too. She would come to visit us. She brought some food, milk, and\nplayed with me. And one day she offered my mother -- | had some sickness. | wasn't feeling\ngood. So she says, I'll take Marcel to my house and I'll give him a bath and | will feed him and |\nwill bring him back.\nAnd my sister -- after a day or two my sister started complaining that she would like to\nget me back to play with her. | was two years older. | am two years older than she is. She is\nstill alive, thanks God. And she bartered and bartered so my mother said, ok, we'll go and get\nMarcel back. So she took off her arm band then.\nBy the way, if you were Jewish and you would take out your arm band, and they would\ndiscover that you were Jewish, this was death. They could kill you on the spot. My mother was\nblond and blue-eye sod she looked not very Jewish.\nSo she went to Jancia's house. She came with Irene. And | was sitting in the corner\nand crying. And Jancia was giving birth to a baby. She was in the ninth month and there was\nnobody. | was the only one there. There was no telephone. Her husband was working. So my\nmother came and did what she could. She boiled some water and, you know, delivered the\nbaby. But the baby was stillborn.\nSo, but it got dark. It got evening. So Jancia said why don't you stay here because it's\ndangerous to walk and then we'll see what we will do. So we stayed there overnight. In the\nmorning, this was August 4, 1942. The next morning her husband comes from his work. He\nwas on the night shift working. And he says, Oh, my gosh what are you doing here; don't you\nknow what's going on in Drohobycz? Of course we didn't know anything. There was no\ntelephones. There was no radio. There was nothing. The Germans confiscated the radios,\ntelephones, and all of that thing. He says if they would come here and see you here, they\nwould kill you and they would kill us, all of us. So he says you better go and hide somewhere\noutside.\nSo he gave -- he or Jancia gave my mother a piece of bread and told us that behind\nthe road there is a wheat field. And behind that there was some trees growing. So they said go\nthere and try to hide there. So we left the house, crossed the street, went through the wheat\nfield. My mother had a raincoat, the color of wheat. She found an indentation in the ground. So\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n6\nshe says we'll lie down there and cover with the coat and see what happens, try to survive. So\nwe did so.\nAnd then soon after that we started hearing dogs barking, Germans screaming,\n\"Raus, raus.\" \"Schnell!.\" When | hear these words, you know, it's terrible. And then it was\nshooting and people screaming of pain. It lasted maybe 15 minutes. Then it got quiet for\nanother 10 or 15 minutes and started all over again. And it lasted like until about 5:00 or\n6:00 in the evening.\n>> Bill Benson: And this is when the German aktion --\n>> Marcel Drimer: One of the aktions by the Germans. This was one of the biggest. So at\nabout 5:00 or 6:00 in the evening it quieted much, like for good so we got up and we started\nwalking towards Jancia's house. As we came to the road, there was a German soldier. | don't\nknow if he was SS. Anyway, he was a uniformed soldier with a dog, standing on the street on\nthe right side. He looked at us. We looked at him. It seemed like it was forever but he just\nturned around and walked away.\nWe wondered many times why he did it. The Germans, when they went hunting for\nJews, they would always go in pairs or more than two because their philosophy was that if\nsomebody sees something and it's not his business, he could turn around and walk away. But\nif there was two -- so there was no chance for the soldier or for the SS men to let the person\nlive. But he was alone, lucky me, for whatever reason.\nSo we walked over the street and came to Jancia and stayed overnight there again.\nThe next day -- excuse me. My father came -- my father stayed in a dormitory at the lumber\nfactory where he worked. There was a dormitory where Jewish men lived who didn't have\nfamilies. Those that have families would go home but during aktion they would stay there.\nSo father came and took us home. We walked to the home and came to our apartment and\nopened the door -- actually, the door was open. There were feathers flying all over the place.\nFurniture were damaged. The apartment was empty. They were all taken. All my aunt and\ncousins and my grandparents. They were kept for two or three days in umshatz platz where\nthey kept people until they got enough of them, without food, without sanitary facilities. And\nthen they were taken to Belzec and killed there.\nBelzec was one of the worst one of the camps. It was a killing camp. There were\nconcentration camps and killing camps. Auschwitz was concentration camp. They would use\npeople to work, as long as they could work, on minimal rations. And then they would bring\nother people and kill those people. The ones that went to Belzec, they were killed immediately.\nSo my grandparents, aunt, and cousin were killed.\nAfter the war, we found out that when the Germans were passing -- well, the Germans\nusually had help from the Ukrainian police or Polish police. So somebody told us that when\nthey passed, when the Germans came through, they passed our apartment. It was hidden from\nthe road. There was a 10 or 12-year-old boy that ran after them and said there are Jews living\nover there, you missed that house. So the Germans came back and took everybody.\n>> Bill Benson: Marcel, soon after you lost your grandparents and other family members, like\nyou described, soon after that, in the fall of 1942, that's when the Germans created a ghetto in\nDrohobycz and you were forced into the ghetto. Tell us what that meant to go into the ghetto\nand what conditions were like for you then.\n>> Marcel Drimer: If you think that -- if it's bad and you think it can't be any worse, that's not\ntrue. In our case any step forward was worse than the previous step. The ghetto, four of us\nlived in one room in the ghetto. There was no furniture. There was only a mattress that we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nrf\nused. Bread, food was impossible to get. The sanitary conditions were terrible. And they\ncontinued their aktions. There would be an aktion and we would hide. We had some primitive\nhide willing places -- hiding places we would hide and then come out.\nSo it couldn't last very long because the Germans took -- they had certain quotas of\npeople that they had to deport to concentration camps. So my father decided that the time is\nright to get out of the ghetto. He bribed -- well, when the Jewish workers from the ghetto went\nto the places where they worked --\n>> Bill Benson: So your father still had his job in the lumber factory.\n>> Marcel Drimer: He was slave labor.\n>> Bill Benson: Right, slave labor in the lumber but he was still able to do that.\n>> Marcel Drimer: Right. They wouldn't let him work in an office. He had to build a little, like,\ndog house or something where he worked but he had the job.\nSO a policeman would come to the ghetto in a certain place. The Jews would getting\nto the and the policemen would guide them to the places where they work. So my father bribed\nthe policeman. My mother put some men's clothing. She took my sister under her arm and my\nfather took me under his arm. We were not obese. Obviously we were thin like sticks. So my\nfather took me and my mother -- and we went marching with the group. And then when we\nwere near the lumber factory, we got out of the group and father put us behind a few bushes.\nHe prepared -- in defense, he prepared, loosened part of the fence so that we could\nget through and said to me, \"I can't take you all together. | will take mother and Irene and then\n| will come and take you.\" Well, | was 8 years old. He says \"You're a man so you have to stay.\"\nSo he took my mother and my sister. | got scared. | heard in the ghetto that people would\nabandon children and try to save their lives. | just didn't -- | was scared. | was a child. So | ran\nout and started screaming, \"Daddy, Daddy!\" And, of course, another policeman showed up. So\nmy father had to bribe that other policeman. He would take things out of his body and give to\nthese policemen.\nBut my father prepared that place to hide us in that factory. There was a big building\nthat was drying wood for furniture and whatever was necessary. So there was an attic there.\nWe had to wait in the place where father worked, until night. And then at night we went there.\nIn the attic of that building father prepared a place for us. There was no stairs or nothing. We\nwould get there, a ladder, and stay. But every day father -- at midnight, father would come and\nbring some food. We would put the string down and pull it up and put down the waste. And\nfather would come at night. We would do it for, | don't know, a week or something.\nThen there was a friend of my father, a lady, told my father that there is another\nwoman, her name was Theresca, that she suspected that my father had somebody in the\ncamp and she will make sure that she's right and she will do the right thing. The right thing in\nher opinion was to report us to the SS and she would get a kilos of flour or a kilos sugar for\neach person that they report to SS. So the other woman told my father.\nMy father said, you know -- he got very panicky, what to do, what to do. He hada\nfriend who was a doctor. There was a little clinic in that place. So he got together with the\ndoctor who was educated in Vienna, a perfect German -- because Drohobycz, before World\nWar II -- World War |, was Austra-Hungary. When my parents were born, it was\nAustra-Hungary. When | was born it was Poland. And now it's Ukraine.\nSo he was educated in Germany and he got an idea. He said, | will write an\nanonymous letter to the SS and tell them that | had a sexual encounter with that woman and\nshe gave me syphilis. And Germans were very touchy about that thing. Because their soldiers\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n8\nhad to be clean. Anyway so next day, two SS men came and picked up this Theresca and\nbrought her to the clinic where this doctor was. So, of course, he confirmed that she had\nsyphilis. So she disappeared until the end of the war. Then she came out and my father told\nher what made her go. Maybe it was the best thing for her.\n>> [Laughter]\n>> Bill Benson: From there, clearly, Marcel, you can't continue staying there. So your father's\ngot to now go find another place for you. | know our time is getting short but we want --\n>> Marcel Drimer: | have to. | have to.\n>> Bill Benson: Absolutely.\n>> Marcel Drimer: So my father went to the villages nearby, especially the village where my\nmother was born, nearby, near Drohobycz, and contacted several people. They didn't want to\nhelp. Some of them threatened him that they'll report him and ask to give the ring or\nsomething.\nWell, anyway, one family, Sawinski family, decided to -- my father promised them a lot\nof things, but they were very decent people. So Mrs. Sawinski decided -- told my father that\nshe would take my mother and my sister. The reason for that is that in Poland, only Jewish\nmen were circumcised. So when the Germans would find under the circumstances -- would\nfind me at that house and they would realize that | am Jewish, everybody would be killed.\nSo my father's philosophy was save anybody that you can save. So a few days later,\nwe came down and we stayed in the dining room, where the workers ate. And Mrs. Sawinski\ncame there to take us. Of course, | was crying and my mother was crying. And Mrs. Sawinski\nstarted to cry. And then at one point she says, Well, whatever will be, will be; | will take the\nboy, too.\n>> Bill Benson: So you said to me this is your mother's version of \"Sophie's Choice.\" Save her\ndaughter but not you.\n>> Marcel Drimer: | don't know if she would go by herself and | don't want to know. But luckily\nMrs. Sawinski --\n>> Bill Benson: I'll take Marcel, too.\n>> Marcel Drimer: So we went to the village where they worked. This was -- we stayed with the\nfamily, with the Sawinski family. The rationing was still in power. And the farmers could not\nslaughter any pigs or chickens or any animals without notifying the Germans. So if they would\ngo and buy more food on the black market, it would be suspicious.\nOh, by the way. | have to hurry up. She allowed us to come and then my father came\nand then my uncle, if was working at the --\n>> Bill Benson: The refinery, right?\n>> Marcel Drimer: Right, as a butcher. So there was 13 of us.\n>> Bill Benson: To make sure people understand, this was a little tiny farmhouse.\n>> Marcel Drimer: Very poor.\n>> Bill Benson: Very poor, dirt floors, very small. And over time 13 people were hidden in\nthere. Did the Sawinskis have children, too?\n>> Marcel Drimer: They had four children.\n>> Bill Benson: So as many as 19 people. Where were you hidden? Obviously you had to be\nhidden away.\n>> Marcel Drimer: In the attic. There was a thatch roof, without a chimney. The smoke would\ncome there.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n9\nBut before my uncle came there, the food -- the youngest boy of the Sawinskis would\ntake a cart with a container and go to the refinery where my uncle was working as a butcher,\nand my uncle would give some meat or bread or something for which he would be killed\nimmediately. And also the scraps from the table, the people ate. When we -- when he came\nback, we, the hiding Jews, had the first choice before they would get their part. It was not\neating. It was just surviving.\n>> Bill Benson: And you had -- there was a hole in the ground where some were hidden, as\nyou said. Some were in the that happened attic where smoke came up through. And there was\na little shed maybe. And you had to rotate somehow, right?\n>> Marcel Drimer: Exactly. Yes. Yes. We did not have a chance to go out and play. My sister\nsaw a chicken once from hiding from the roof and she says, \"Why can't | be the chicken?\" The\nchicken just runs around and nobody bothers him and | have to stay here. We bathed once a\nmonth. There was lice, bed bugs. It was just absolutely terrible conditions.\n>> Bill Benson: And you were there for almost a year. Right?\n>> Marcel Drimer: Right. The Russian Army liberated us on the 5th of August 1944.\n>> Bill Benson: So almost a year. So you went through the winter.\n>> Marcel Drimer: Through the winter and the fall.\n>> Bill Benson: And the winters are extremely tough. So how did you survive the winter in\nthere?\n>> Marcel Drimer: We were close. [Laughter] Physically close.\n>> Bill Benson: Right. Right.\n>> Marcel Drimer: | couldn't -- most of the time | could not stand up. | had to lie down. | could\nnot talk loud because somebody could hear. That's the way we lived and that's the way we\nsurvived.\n>> Bill Benson: You shared with me -- | mean, of course you could not do anything to bring\nattention to you, the fact that any of you were there. And you couldn't get medical care. You\nhad a very scary time with your sister, right?\n>> Marcel Drimer: She was so sick. She was bleeding. We worried where would we bury her\nso as not to make -- get somebody to realize that we were there. | did not see a dentist for\nthree years. | did not see a doctor. It was a very, very tough, tough time.\n>> Bill Benson: After a year. And you can only give us a glimpse of that here. Tell us about\nyour liberation. How did that come about?\n>> Marcel Drimer: Well, the Soviet Army liberated us, as | said, the 5th of August. We heard\nwe were liberated. We were ecstatic.\n>> Bill Benson: But before that, there were bombardments going on all around you.\n>> Marcel Drimer: Right. The allies came from the territories that they also had in Europe and\nthey would bomb the factories, the lumber -- no, not lumber, but the oil so that the Germans\nwould not have oil. So this was the only time that we would come out from hiding and stay\nthere because everybody else was hiding.\n>> Bill Benson: So everybody else goes in their shelters and you could come out while\nbombing was going on.\n>> Marcel Drimer: Right. Right. The only time.\n>> Bill Benson: What did the Russians do when they liberated you?\n>> Marcel Drimer: Well, they were -- they made my father the director of the factory where my\nfather worked, luckily. A Russian officer comes once to my father to order some lumber for the\nfront and my father was barefoot. So the Russian officer says, \"You are a director of the factory\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n10\nand you are barefoot. How could this be?\" He says,\" | don't have any money. There is nothing\navailable.\"\nHe told them what the situation was. When we got out from the Sawinski's, it was in\nthe same shirts and pants that we came in. So the Russian officer gave my father some\nmilitary boots. And then my father asked how about -- at that time | was 10 years old. | have a\n10-year-old boy and he also doesn't have any shoes. So | got military shoes. | ruined my feet\nwith that.\n>> Bill Benson: Marcel, that was August of 1944. Of course, the war continued in Europe until\nApril of 1945 and the armies were moving on as they moved westward. Were you able\nto -- you started to go to school. Tell us what that was like for you.\n>> Marcel Drimer: Right. The children -- | would be very quiet. | would just sit quiet and not\nplay with other children, talk very low, very quietly. So the teacher asked my mother to come\nand she said, What's wrong with your son? Why doesn't he play with other children? Why\ndoesn't he talk, scream, like children? So my mother explained that this is what the reality was.\n| couldn't walk. My muscles atrophied. So | couldn't play with other children.\nSo after the war, | tried to catch up. | lost three years of schooling because | should\nhave started at 7 and | started at 8. | caught up some. But it was tough.\nAnd after the Russians came, all the Jews got out of the hiding and came to the\nmiddle of town. There was about 400 Jews left.\n>> Bill Benson: Out of about 17,000.\n>> Marcel Drimer: Out of 17,000. There were some more that came from Russia and some\nthat were partisans, some were in Polish Army and Russian Army. So all together about 700\nJews survived out of 17,000 Jews.\n>> Bill Benson: Marcel, of course, you lived under Communist rule until 1961, when you finally\nmade your way here.\n| want to leave a little bit of time for a couple of questions from our audience, but\nbefore we do that, you just recently, this last year, you and Ania went back to Drohobycz, first\ntime -- you had been to Poland but you had never been to Drohobycz since 1945. Briefly --\n>> Marcel Drimer: 1946.\n>> Bill Benson: Briefly, what was that like to go back?\n>> Marcel Drimer: It was absolutely amazing. It was absolutely amazing. What happened is\nthe Sawinskis had -- in addition to these four children that were there when we were, two\ndaughters that were one was married and one was sent to Germany for slave labor. | didn't\nrealize. | didn't know about it. But a young lady, Maria, studied history in Drohobycz. And she\nwanted to write a story of her family. Somehow somebody remembered that there was a young\nboy, Marcel -- my name was spelled different. So she started Googling and researching and\nfound out one of my stories that | talked to in the University of West Virginia, the Holocaust\nMuseum, so she wrote a letter saying -- telling us that she was the grand, grand,\ngranddaughter of the Sawinskis and she was the one that has the photos that we have here.\nAnd | have many more photos. And she invited us.\nWe went with a group of survivors from Israel. Only four were survivors, my sister and\n| and two from Israel. And the others were second generation, third generation. But it was an\namazing trip. | had the chance to put some flowers on Mrs. Sawinski's grave. She died in 1957.\nAnd | was with the whole family. Maria's grandfather was one of the grandchildren of the\nSawinski's, the only one that remembered. So we talked about it. We exchanged photos. We\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n11\nwent to the places where the train took people to the extermination camp, to the places where\npeople were killed in forests.\nOne place where my uncle's wife and daughter were killed was in the forest, 6,000\npeople in that forest were killed. We would go from place to place and pray for the dead. And\ntell our stories. Those that remembered stories, we tell for the others. They spoke Hebrew,\nmost of them. But my sister translated.\nOh, and | -- Maria asked me to talk to her class to her student class. | talked to her\nclass. | gave them -- offer | can speak English or Polish. So in western Ukraine, Polish is quite\npopular. They speak a lot of Polish. So | talked Polish about what | am telling to you except\nthat it wasn't there, it was here. The ghetto was about two blocks from where | was talking to\nthem. The forest was about three miles where people were killed.\n>> Bill Benson: The Sawinski's home.\n>> Marcel Drimer: The home, was already in ruins, a new home. We tried to bring her here for\nvacation and stay with her but visa did not work. She spent $150 for the application of the visa.\nAnd they, in the Ukraine, they earn -- she graduated history the department and she was a\nteacher. And she earns $50 a month.\n>> Bill Benson: And the application fee was three months' wages.\n>> Marcel Drimer: Three months' wages. They didn't accept it. | mean, this was our people.\n>> Bill Benson: Marcel, | think we are at 12:00 so | think we're not going to have time for\nquestions from the audience. But, when Marcel finishes, because we've not quite heard the\nlast from Marcel, he's going to remain here on the stage. So we invite you, any of you, all of\nyou, believe it or not, to come up on stage and meet Marcel, shake his hand, get your picture\ntaken with him, whatever you want to do, or ask him a question. Please feel free to do that.\n| want to thank all of you for being with us. | remind you we'll have a First Person\nprogram each Wednesday and Thursday until the middle of August. So | hope you can come\nback sometime this year. But if not, next year. You can find information and transcripts from\nour programs and podcasts on our website. So you can see other programs as well as this\none.\nIt's our tradition at First Person that our First Person gets the last word. So I'm going to\nturn now to Marcel to close us out.\n>> Marcel Drimer: Last word. | am talking to you and others who want to listen to me because\nthere are people and organizations who claim that the Holocaust is a hoax, that it never\nhappened, that the Jews made it up to get money from the Germans. | am a witness that it did\nhappen. By listening to the stories of my childhood, you become witnesses also.\nOur good friend, the -- said that we all have to fight the four evil Is: intolerance,\ninjustice, ignorance, and indifference. These are the roots of men's moral corruptions that\nallowed Hitler and his helpers to come to power and torture and murder millions of people he\nconsidered under people, not worth living, not only Jews but people with disabilities, gypsies,\nhomosexuals, and many other groups. Changing these behaviors is the path to preventing\nHolocausts and genocides. And this is what this Holocaust Museum is all about.\nAbout indifference, | would like to read this short statement here. This was Pastor\nMartin Niemoller when he was liberated from Dachau.\n\u201cFirst they came for the socialist and | did not speak out because | was not a socialist.\nThen they came for the trade unionist and | did not speak out because | was not a trade\nunionist. Then they came for the Jews and | did not speak out because | was not a Jew. Then\nthey came for me and there was no one left to speak for me.\u201d\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n12\nSo there is something to think about.\n>> [Applause]\n",
