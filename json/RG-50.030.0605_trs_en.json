I went to India, and I decided I had to go by way of London, and I was going to stop and visit with this cousin, and he picked me up at the airport and took me to a motel, and we visited. And the next day they gave me a very big treat. They took me to the British Museum, which I loved. This is fine. But while we're having a small snack, my bag was gone with everything, everything, everything you can imagine in it, mainly the passport and the VISA for in India, and it was really quite awful. And so we went from there to the American Embassy, Grosvenor Square, where they wouldn't let me in because I didn't have identification. Well, if I had identification, I wouldn't have to be there. So anyhow, finally somebody came out and let me in, and they started the process of giving me a temporary passport, and I had to go and get a picture taken, all that. It was a major mess. And then the next day I thought I would not be able to get into India because of British the Indian High Commission 1s closed, but it was open on Saturday. So I went there, another cousin took me, her sister, and I waited because he had to go and get money. For some reason or other, the banks were closed or something. I don't know. It could happen. And anyhow, I waited and waited and waited, and they got very tired of having me sit there, and I really wanted to get out of there. So eventually I got the VISA into my new passport. And then, the next day I was going to India and the plane was supposed to leave at 8:00 9:00 in the morning, but it didn't leave until 6:30 in the afternoon, so I sat at the airport for many hours, and my cousin brought some money so I could buy a lipstick and a comb.
