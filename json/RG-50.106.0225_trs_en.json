But my mother was very able in many ways and she ran a textile store and he helped her with that. So they sort of did it together, but my mother was the driving force behind the store, which her father I think helped \u2014 her father helped all the \u2014 she had seven brothers and sisters and all of them came to Vienna.

            "answer": "This was 38. This is actually before I was eight. In March 1938 the Germans essentially annexed Austria and we were within, and Hitler gave a speech the next day on the northwest Bahn Platz and we could see him from our window, except there were SS men all over the neighborhood to keep people from being at the windows. I would go to the window and I would be shooed away. So I have a vivid memory of that event and I remember you know these swastika banners that they had and I can\u2019t even look at them now, you know with that, so that was an early memory. And I was already eight. I have earlier memories of the school that I went to which was a Jewish school. Ancostalitz Gasse which was a street nearby. And I remember the park. We lived near the Altgarten which is a famous park in the, in Vienna which still stands and various things that happened there. So I remember and I guess I also remember we used to go to a resort when I was four or five called V\u00e9slau, V-O umlaut \u2014 S-L-A-U, I believe. And we used to go there in the summer. I have memories of that too, learning to swim which we weren\u2019t allowed for three years later on. I forgot how to swim. And I didn\u2019t realize I had forgotten it and we lived in Milwaukee and I jumped in the pool and I sank. I was told you never forget how to swim, but you do."

I remember I had a collection mania which I think very young kids sometimes have and I was collecting stamps. In my last memory of leaving Vienna was in our apartment which was on the fourth floor and had a kind of oven, you know a stove, not a stove. What do you call it? You know you heated it with wood or coal oil, what it was and I remember my mother https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Sucher 9 July 23, 2014 saying I could not take my paper soldiers with me and I, the last thing I remember is seeing them burning inside.

I have it up over there. And Pll show it to you later if you like. And so we were very close and as I said, as twins sometimes too, they develop a language of their own. And she was, it was, she was more forceful than I was and she sort of, she dominated the relationship you know. And we had a game playing that. Ok. We each had special names for each other and it lasted a long time. Instead of when I see her now, we used to make faces like this and it was what we called it a nuchi face and for many years we would still do that. It\u2019s just built in."

And it was sort of a model, a role model for me of a strong man. Had several, like these strong men would come to my rescue if anything bad happened. It was a fantasy but I had.

My father, I went along with my father to a synagogue but it wasn\u2019t the same place we usually went. Maybe that temple had been closed. And when we came out there were SS people waiting to corral the people who come out and take them away. But my father was with me and since he had a small child with him, they let him go. So then I knew that things were very, very bad. And were getting worse and it was, you had asked me when I became very aware of it after the annexation.

But my father apparently managed to get a visa to Luxembourg so he left in August. I don\u2019t know how he did it. I don\u2019t know those details, but the upshot was that my mother and the four children didn\u2019t get to Luxembourg. He managed to get us transit visas through Austria and https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Sucher 14 July 23, 2014 Germany. To visit him in Luxembourg. And we, I remember that we, my mother and the four children took a train from Vienna. I don\u2019t remember the train ride but I remember what happened at the end. And I think the train, we took a train as far as Coblenz, which is a town in southeast Germany. A big town. And from Coblenz we went to Trier the next day. I think by, we went to Trier, T-R-I-E-R. Trier, it\u2019s actually it\u2019s the birthplace of Karl Marx I discovered many years later. And from there my memory of that is that we had no place to stay. But my mother found a synagogue and she pounded on the door. And somebody eventually opened it and we slept on the floor that night. The next night, the next day we took a taxi to the frontier and this had all been prearranged with my father. I knew nothing about it. And we arrived at the frontier. I have a picture of the guard house in the thing that I wrote about. And to make a long story short, they patted us down and without my knowing it my mother had sewn some money inside my mitze [ph], you know it\u2019s a sort of an overhead cap that ties at the neck. And anyway but the German guards were very friendly, especially with the children. And at 10:00 at night my mother took the four of us. We were at a bridge which crossed the river which I call the, it was called the Sauer or the Sare in French, it had a double name. The river separating Luxembourg and Germany. And we walked across this bridge and it was all icy and snowy. We walked across and waited 20 minutes and then a man came in a car and my mother spoke to him. And my father had hired him to smuggle us into Luxembourg cause it was Christmas eve and there was nobody around from the guards, from the Luxembourg guards. It was sort of a forlorn place. And that\u2019s how we got into Luxembourg."

And at some point my parents, or my mother said we\u2019re going to leave and anyway I quit the school. And I felt a little bit guilty because they had given me a going away present. I https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Sucher 16 July 23, 2014 remember it was a silver pencil. The class gave me that but we hadn\u2019t left yet. It took a few months before we left so I sort of felt I was under false pretenses getting this gift. Apparently I loved pencils as a kid. So anyway that\u2019s how that went down. And my mother had six or seven brothers and sisters and all of them lived in Vienna and all of them got away except for one, you know one of her younger brothers named David. And the fact that he didn\u2019t get away, that\u2019s another black mark I have against very religious Jews because apparently they could have gotten away, but they went to consult a rabbi in Poland. He and his wife had had a child after 15 years and anyway he was like no don\u2019t go to Israel. You know there are still people like that. It\u2019s a Zionistic place, you don\u2019t want that.

There was a couple of kids, and the four of us would go out and we got very interested in these, it\u2019s the equivalent of a comic book with these little pictures and there was sort of heroes. Like there was a guy named Rolf Tore and I still remember the name. He was an adventurer in Africa. And there were 64 pages, these booklets. They still exist. And there was a sort of Sherlock Holmes type named Elon Cling and I remember getting very interested in these books. I could read them, but the thing is we didn\u2019t have any money, as children. There was hardly any money. Just my mother managed to sew and make some money. But now I remember, now that you mention it, I\u2019d forgotten this. We used to go steal comic books or these equivalent books. And I think the boys were named Katz. They were very daring. They did the stealing and my sister was the lookout and I sort of stayed I don\u2019t know where. She was the lookout for them for the \u2014 and so we read those books. That was one thing we did. And I sort of became interested in chess at the time. I didn\u2019t play but many of the men played chess. And I remember there was one guy who was regarded as the best player, named Solomon. I remember his last name. He was just known as Solomon. And I decided gee I want to be a chess master when I grow up. Although I didn\u2019t play at the time. Those are the things. Oh and I remember something else. This hotel had a sort of nightclub, eatery or something like that. And they had a floor show. And the floor show consisted of women, almost nude and I just, my friends and I discovered the lure of semi naked young women. And at some point they would come down for the show. They would come down some stairs and I remember \u2014 these are the things you remember. And we would be under the stairs. You know the stairs, waiting for them to come down so we could catch a glimpse. So it was https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Sucher 19 July 23, 2014 quite a place. We found it again. My late wife and I went to Luxembourg. I couldn\u2019t remember the name of the hotel, because it changed its name. But we went to a local police station and there was an older guy there who knew what it was and where it was and eventually we found it. I wrote about that in this essay, the memoir that\u2019s at the Holocaust Museum."

It had 50,000 population, something like that. So for the first four or five months we lived in this small town and I went to a one room school there. And it was, the teacher was a father, meaning a priest and he wore this hassock in the head back. So I went to this school and I didn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember, the school was going on but I hadn\u2019t had any mathematics and he gave us a long division problem and I didn\u2019t know how to do it. And I felt very ashamed somehow. As I once https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Sucher 20 July 23, 2014 said to somebody I think it was, that\u2019s what interested me in mathematics and physics later on, as a counter to that. But because I didn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t do long division. I guess we hadn\u2019t learned. Well I went without school basically for two years I guess, except for that stint. I didn\u2019t go to school in Portugal. I had other adventures. But I remember that and I remember my father. We lived in a hotel, at this little town called Esch and he was studying Spanish because he was trying to get a visa to Ecuador or wherever he could get it, any place, but here so to speak. But all he had was a dictionary. So I remember him walking around using the dictionary as a lecture book. And many months later he knew enough Spanish to be the guide for our, we went through occupied France and Spain and we spent Yom Kippur night in 1940, it was October 1940 in a barracks in a town called Irun, which 1s now a sort of resort town. At that time it was a small town and they had a amelig [ph], I guess that\u2019s what you call it and the refugees. And we were several hundred of us or a hundred and we stayed overnight at that place. It was Yom Kippur night and I remember my father leading some kind of service. And he was able to communicate in Spanish with this dictionary with the guards. So it goes on like that. There\u2019s so much to tell you. I don\u2019t know where to stop."

And that we would sooner or later go to, but it took him a long time to arrange the smuggling. We never did get visas to enter Luxembourg. We just got visas, transit visas to leave, to -- I don\u2019t know the details of that. I just infer it. All I was aware was that we were going on this long train ride and we have yet to find a place to sleep. I think from Coblenz to Trier, my brother had a different memory about some of these things which I didn\u2019t realize. For example from Trier we had to get to the border. It\u2019s about ten miles away or something like that but we had to get there and there was no public transportation. So we hired, my mother hired a taxi and what I didn\u2019t realize, that my brother said, there were two border stations not far from each other at the river, going across to Luxembourg. And my brother told me that there were two taxis that came and one of them took us but he wasn\u2019t sure he was going to go to the wrong one. He was, where this man from Luxembourg was going to pick us up, we had to be at the right station. And according to my brother, he understood the discussion between these two taxi drivers. He heard it, that this taxi said no you have to go to this other station. So there were many little things that could have gone wrong. That\u2019s why I call this essay that I wrote, luck was on our side. Maybe I can find it before you leave. But anyway, it\u2019s in the museum. I can send you a copy if you want."

I looked at a map. We got on this train in Irun. That was the name of this border town, I-R-U-N. It\u2019s still on maps, Irun. And we took a train and we got to the border of Portugal and Spain. On the opposite side was a town called Vila Formosa, beautiful village which still exists. And but we were held up for a day before they let this train go over the border where some of us were allowed to go into Lisbon. We were not allowed to go to Lisbon because our papers weren\u2019t right. So we stayed in this border town for about four or five months til we got permission to go to Lisbon itself."

            "answer": "Well I wasn\u2019t there when they went to the buses and so forth. So it was, there was a lot that I don\u2019t, wasn\u2019t \u2014 I only inferred later. I wasn\u2019t -- my sister was more mature at our age cause girls usually are. So she remembers some things that I have forgotten. So she wises me up. So anyway so we got to Luxembourg. I mean we got to Portugal. To this town called Vila Formosa, which is also I remember it pretty clear because for two items. I write about one of them. One 1s that we didn\u2019t go to school there. But we played a lot with each other. And with a couple of other Luxembourg kids named Monique and Roger. I still remember the names. They were the children of very wealthy Luxembourg store owners who also had become refugees. And so we met them there and we spent a lot of time palling around. And I remember this town stored cork boards. Portugal is a cork producer and they were 20 feet high and we would bounce around among them. It was very innocent play, I still remember those. The other thing that I remember is that at one time, a British sailor came into the town. And I remember he had a blue pea jacket and he had his boat had been sunk somewhere. And he had made his way from Spain to Portugal hoping to go actually to Lisbon to sail back to England, get back. And he sort of took us under his wing and my sister and I maybe some of the other, went with him. We walked around. And at that time I was obsessed with getting a sling shot. I guess it was sort of David and Goliath. And I had, the interesting thing is that I found the fork, a piece of wood that could serve as a fork and I had a rubber band which I could use to tie. But I didn\u2019t have a little piece of leather that you could use for putting a stone in when you \u2014 and I mentioned this to this guy. And I\u2019Il never forget what he did. He had a pocket knife because it\u2019s one of the things he saved. And he bent down and unlaced one of his shoes and he cut off the tongue and he gave it to me to use as a\u2014 I think I wrote an essay once but I never finished it called a gift of tongue about this. I didn\u2019t know his name so I lost sight of him. There are others, these things that you remember. So anyway, eventually we got to, we were allowed to go to Porto, Oporto, which is the second biggest city in. We were not allowed to get to go to Lisbon but we somehow were allowed to leave Vila Formosa after about four months. And we spent four or five months in Oporto and that was memorable for various reasons. One of them was that I became more aware of women https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Sucher 26 July 23, 2014 or girls will I say and I fell in love with Olivia De Havilland for a peculiar reason. Somehow, I guess we were pretty cute kids and the owner of one of the restaurants not far from where we lived, knew we would like to go to the movies and he arranged for waiters to take us, Erika and me and two blond girls who also lived in the same building with us. We would come every Saturday or something like that, to this Plaza de la Libertad, that was the name of it. And we would got to his restaurant and the guy would send a waiter with us and we could go to any movie that we wanted to. So we went to the movies as often as we could. Although we didn\u2019t understand the language, a lot of it, I didn\u2019t realize til much later I was living in a fool\u2019s paradise, cause they were showing Superman, Batman, a lot of the American serials. But we saw them as a continuous movie. I didn\u2019t realize that when we came to the States I realized they had the same stuff but only got 15 minutes so there was an explosion and you come back the next week to see the rest of it. But we saw all these movies and we also saw Robin Hood. And there was Olivia De Havilland with her long tail and so I fell in love with her. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the first one with Olivia De Havilland. But I knew that we wanted to get to Lisbon because that\u2019s where the boats left from. And eventually we got permission to go to Lisbon. It took us about \u2014 my father would go to the consulate every week and so forth and there are all these jokes about that. You go to the consulate trying to get a visa and so forth, and you have to have an affidavit, all very complicated but the stories of the guy who goes to the consulate and they, you tell him well come back a year from now. And they guy is very excited, morning or afternoon. You know this joke. Anyway that\u2019s the kind of \u2014 garde humor, that means sort of hangman\u2019s humor. Anyway so we eventually got this, well we eventually got an affidavit from some not so rich relatives in Milwaukee. You needed an affidavit to come to the States. And we had some very rich distant relatives in Kingston, New York but we never got anything from them, but anyway somebody, my cousin\u2019s grandmother who lived in Chicago persuaded \u2014 her daughter was married to a furrier named Bine and he sent us an affidavit so when we came to America eventually we went to Milwaukee, cause my mother could sew very well and he needed a finisher for his furs. Anyway that\u2019s how we wound up in Milwaukee for a while. Yes, apropos of getting on the boat in Lisbon. Many years later there was a PBS program about the difficulties Jews had getting out of Europe and how hundreds of thousands more could have come if it weren\u2019t for the policies of the State Department. And there was a guy in the State https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Sucher 27 July 23, 2014 Department, whom they showed a picture of who deliberately tried to limit the number of Jews coming to the States. More than necessary. And he sent messages to the consulates in Europe. Don\u2019t give anybody visas and so forth. And the place he was most insistent about was the one in Portugal, because that\u2019s where most, by that time, most people who were trying to get to the States were coming from Portugal. I\u2019ve forgotten his name but I look it up every once in a while. His name was Eagleton or something like that. He\u2019s well known for having been a sort of Machiavellian guy from the State Department."

And I knew they were going to have Packards here. When I met my wife long ago. It turned out her grandfather had bought a Packard while he was \u2014 I think they no longer have that. It was sort of the Cadillacs of the time. I don\u2019t know if they still make Packards or not but for a long time it was the car to have. So I didn\u2019t \u2014 I had learned some American songs or English songs from that sailor. The sailor whom we had met and who cut the shoelace for my slingshot. He taught us My Body Lies Over the Ocean. We didn\u2019t know what the words meant but we learned that song. And there was another song. Something, Give a Dog a Bone. This old man is rolling home. Anyway we learned these songs by rote and we never forgot them, but I forgotten it. It was my introduction to English. I really didn\u2019t know any English when we came except when we came to Milwaukee my sister and I were put into a class for backward children. And that was very good because we crocheted and https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Sucher 28 July 23, 2014 made lanyards and stuff like that. But we were learning English at the same time and after a sort of semester they put us into a regular classroom. Not only that, I became the English star of the place because they were putting on a Christmas play called The Little Pine Tree. And the biggest part was the little pine tree. And they decided that I was the only one who could memorize all these lines so I played the little pine tree that was cut down in this Christmas play."

My mother was doing something else, I don\u2019t remember. And so there we were. And an https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Sucher 30 July 23, 2014 ice cream man came by in a little thing. And my father decided to buy us ice cream. So this was my first culture shock. So we each got a little Dixie cup. We needed to have it and I opened the top and I couldn\u2019t figure out how to eat it cause there was no spoon attached. And then the ice cream guy pointed out to us that at the back of the flap that you remove, there\u2019s a little wooden spoon so that was my first introduction to America -- the wooden spoon in the ice cream thing. And then we, my father and I went to live in a hotel on Lafayette Square next to where John Wanamaker store is, somewhere. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s still there or not. And my mother and my sister went to live with her younger sister who had already been in the States for a number of years, the one who had gone to Cuba. All the other sisters and brothers managed to get to Palestine. So there were these two families who got, lead to the States. And from Cuba they were already in the States when we arrived. So she stayed with her and Erika did too. And after about a few weeks we managed to go to, take a bus to Luxembourg. Not to Luxembourg, to Milwaukee which is to stay, there was a man. This relative of his, really the husband of a distant relative who sent us the affidavits. And my mother could work for him. And my father was trying to find a new vocation. And he studied accounting and he did that for a while. In any case but cause he couldn\u2019t do anything with his PhD in Semitic languages. It was just not \u2014 but there were a lot of people like that. And I remember feeling very strange once. When I was 16 or so I got a job working as a messenger on Wall Street. My uncle from this \u2014 was married to my mother\u2019s younger sister, the one who had been in Cuba, became a stock broker. So he got me this job and it was Sutro brothers, got me this job as a messenger. And I would go there maybe on the weekends or in the afternoon. I don\u2019t remember. But it was in a room full of other people who were also messengers. And I felt a little bit bad. I was the youngest one there. And a lot of these people were older men. One of them had been a professor of music in Russia. You realize when you come, you do whatever is necessary to make a living. And I felt a little bit guilty about taking the place of some older person might have been -- just put there. I was a very bad messenger because I got interested in crossword puzzles and you know when you walk. As a messenger I would take stock from one company to another. That was my job and I would be walking on Wall Street whatever it was. And there were a lot of trash cans. And the New York Daily News was probably among them and they always had a crossword puzzle you could do so I fished them out, all these sales.

We were trying to bring them to the States now that we were there. And I remember it was a long voyage cause it was a freighter and it went around the Cape of Good Hope and so forth.

I remember that. So then when he came, he was made into a, he was already 17 or all of going on 18. And he was made a citizen immediately and then he could be drafted. And he was drafted. And the interesting things about is that he went to the medical corps and when D Day came and he was, he came with the medical corps and a number of weeks later. He went back, he was stationed in Havana you see but he made a side trip to Luxembourg. So he, the way he tells us, we had been there four years before the refugees when he was 14 or 15 and very skinny and runty. And he walked into this hotel, the Hotel Select and the landlady sort of recognized him and she almost fainted.

Some were, especially my math teacher, Mrs. Macovsky and we were very good in class and some of the teachers invited us out for lunch or something. We went to teach in New Jersey and together with Frances cause we were there in high school together. So we were sort of treated in a slightly special way because we were refugees, I think."

But Rasmussen was a good experience because I had two excellent math teachers which got me interested in math and I was on the math team and also there was also a chess club and I joined that. So but I did try a sport once. Not long after I was going to go to Rasmussen, I said you should try for the track team. So I went early one morning just for this purpose and Rasmussen, the building sort of has a surrounding the original building. Rasmussen is the oldest high school in the United States, it\u2019s very old. And the old building is sort of in the middle so set up inthe __. And the track was just going to go over. We could run around it but I had never done this before. So I did join the track event. I tried out and I ran around as much as you had to and then I laid down and began to be sick right away. You know if you run a lot, you should not lie down. You should keep walking and slowing down instead of collapsing. You have to keep walking, keep walking. That was my one attempt at sports. Decided it was not for me."

And a friend of mine, Ranny Rachma, who was also called in and after a while we were the only people who came were Rachma and myself.

Oh I don\u2019t play chess any more. No we, you know he says we should go. At Brooklyn College they had two lounges. There was a popular lounge of people listening to popular music and a classical lounge. And they played bridge. And the bridge went to the popular music. There was another lounge called the classical lounge where they had chess tables and they played classical music. So we had to go to that classical lounge cause there were chess tables there. But also at Brooklyn College there were hundreds of clubs. And it so happens that the tango club was giving tango lessons in the lobby of this lounge. And as I walked in, I said to this guy maybe we should to do the tango. You can\u2019t do the tango, could you? Yes Ican. My sister taught me. So they were teaching. There were couples going around and there was this cute girl standing by the desk, not doing anything. And I went up to her and I said would you like to tango. She said well I\u2019m not teaching. I said well I\u2019m not learning. But that was, we cut our next class and we were engaged in two weeks. It was just a terrific \u2014"

Well when we moved to New York there is a whole other sidelight to this which may be that my brother and, when my brother got out of the army and my father, they became diamond cutters. And the reason for that was I had a very clever cousin, the cosponsor of my \u2014 his mother was my father\u2019s sister. They were also in Vienna. They had gotten to France, escaping. But they were overtaken by the Germans at some point. And Henry my close cousin and his sister and his family, he 1s now about to be 90 in August, were on their own. But he was very clever. He learned French very rapidly. So he got along as assistant to various people. And he managed, he got to the States and he managed to get his parents out of a, an internment camp in France and brought them to the States. And he, Henry had sort of began to study diamond cutting and when his father came, he got him into the diamond cutting business also. And when my brother and my father so eventually all four of them were diamond cutters. My cousin Henry eventually became a dealer. He invented a stone which was called the queen\u2019s cut which was for the queen of Thailand for her 60\" birthday or anniversary or something. But the patent was stolen but he told me it\u2019s too expensive to pursue patents. But anyway that\u2019s a whole other story that side of the family. But he was also like my brother, cause my brother was in the army and he was like a surrogate brother. He was very close to me. So that\u2019s how we got to New York. It was via the Grossbart family and my brother getting out of the army. And my mother\u2019s younger sister, my aunt, Tante Lotte as we used to call her, she was living in Brooklyn so that all helped to make things \u2014"

I was at SERN, that\u2019s a European nuclear physics research place. And Kennedy was killed. And all the people there thought well Johnson must have engineered it and I said no you\u2019re completely wrong about that. That\u2019s the European thing. Who 1s the next one? Somebody assassinates the king so new king. That made me realize that they don\u2019t do really get America somehow.

Pll tell you a quick story about what happens when you become an American. Well you were asking me about do I feel Austrian. I said no I never feel Austrian, but I feel European occasionally but my main feeling is being an American and it\u2019s especially keen when I go to Europe, I feel very American.

Reason of physics https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Sucher 41 July 23, 2014 and so I was there.

And every once in a while somebody would say something about the Juden and this was 25, 30 years later. So but the people that I know that I became friends with, there are some Germans among them and I feel they were among the good guys. But I feel very guarded when I went to Germany. In some way that is difficult to describe. I didn\u2019t want to ask them what did you, what did your father do during the war. I just sort of played it cool. And I have a good friend who\u2019s here now who actually was born in Germany, joined the department.

I have a picture \u2014 I want to show you the picture later of her with a good friend of hers at the march in Washington in 19 \u2014 and I\u2019m in the subway. I had lost the picture but the three of us are in there. So I was in fact, my one attempt at politics was among the physicists was to propose a, that we boycott those states that are not supporting the Equal Rights Amendment cause it was 40 years ago. And to my surprise and chagrin, most of my colleagues didn\u2019t agree with me. That was my attempt to sort of do something political."

You know the joke about the family moves to the south and the boy\u2019s got to be bar mitzvahed but there is nobody to do the ceremony so they write to Brooklyn and to make it short, the Brooklyn man comes down and he arrives at the railroad station and he\u2019s got payess and a hat and a shtal and whatever it is and the kids had never seen anything like this before so they follow him like the Pied Piper. And he gets more and more annoyed as he\u2019s walking along the street. And finally he turns around and he said what\u2019s the matter? You never saw a Yankee before? That\u2019s the way it goes."

She lives in lower Manhattan. Sometimes I stay with her. My older brother. I didn\u2019t see. He was away during my most formative years. He was in the army so my cousin sort of became my brother basically. They were great friends.

The thing that amazed her was to see a Jewish policeman. I should go more often but hasn\u2019t happened. But I have a fair number of \u2014 but I have my cousins in Israel. And we once got together actually. We all met in Vienna. And the oldest cousin, Yoshi is his name. He was old enough to know where all the stores that the cousins had were. We walked around Vienna and so forth and he said here was so and so and here was so and so. So that was very interesting. That was the last time I saw him. I have another cousin who 1s a cancer specialist, used to be the head of the Rambam cancer institute but he comes every few years to attend some kind of conference and so I see him from time to time. My other cousin, Louis Shwalaba, Lilly Spiegel, the daughter of my Tante Lotte, she has children who live in Israel and so she goes to Israel very often so there\u2019s that connection. And she lets me know when he\u2019s coming. Sometimes I go to New York to meet him in her apartment. Lives in Queens and Erika comes too.

I went to the \u2014 my sister and I used to play in the Altgarten which 1s the big park in Vienna which was very near our house and I used to go there as a child. I think I still have a bump in my head in some way here. A slight bump cause I slipped and fell against a steel railing but never mind. But the strange experience I had there. I was going, walking through this park and in this park there were two huge antiaircraft towers from 50, 60 years ago from when the Germans were https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Sucher 49 July 23, 2014 afraid of bombing from England and these towers like circular. The walls are six meters thick and they\u2019re still there because they tried to dynamite them away but it was too difficult so they\u2019re there. And I saw them and as I was walking through there are some plantings in front of them, little six feet by four feet plantings. And one of, 1t must be the name of a plant and there were some sticks in the ground which have the name of the plant. I assume it was so because it said Traumlant, which means the land of dreaming. And I thought that was so \u2014 it sort of was just a juxtaposition of these antiaircraft towers. It just struck me as an odd thing. I mean that somebody would plant just these flowers there. Many of these little events that take place that have a big meaning because of some memory that you have. I remember that. And I remember, I was going to. I want to show you this picture of Erika and myself. . Pl show you later. Yes, when I went to \u2014 the time I was in Vienna, I tried to visit the school that I went to. And you could visit it but you had to go through a lot of guards before you could enter inside."

And I have physics friends in Austria and so forth but I gave a talk there once and, you know as long as you don\u2019t dig too far into the past you\u2019re sort of ok. I don\u2019t feel awkward about going to Austria. Whereas I would feel somewhat awkward about going to Germany. Because there was a source. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more to say but I\u2019m not so far. I did get interviewed by somebody once. I think I told you. This woman named Doris English who was writing a book about either teenagers or older people who succeeded in academic life in the United States and she was interviewing these people. You probably don\u2019t know a very good friend of mine. She was Dorothy\u2019s best friend. Her name is Evelyn Tortenbeck. You know the name? Because she appeared in \u2014 actually somebody interviewed people in Montgomery County and she appears in that book. I don\u2019t know https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Sucher 50 July 23, 2014 if you know that book or not. She goes back, she doesn\u2019t feel the same way that I do. She goes back to Germany if necessary, she doesn\u2019t hesitate to go, whereas I would think twice. And she grew up in Vienna and then she escaped via Italy and Turkey, whatever it was. That was the name of the book. She came over. It was the SS Manhattan and I looked it up. You know what makes the SS Manhattan famous? You\u2019ll never guess. Some of the Charlie Chan episodes and so forth were filmed on the SS Manhattan, which doesn\u2019t exist anymore. These curious things you find out when you go to the web. You find out this and that. And so people react differently about going back."

I can\u2019t remember the name of it but it\u2019s a famous book. I didn\u2019t read all of it, but I read the first few pages. And he says that civilization depends on about, at least 25% or 30% of the people have to be on the side of right. If 1t goes below that stupidity takes over and such a thing that the world is going to go to hell and all the states, that that\u2019s the \u2014 Max Frankel. I don\u2019t remember the name of the book. I have to look it up every once in a while but it was a very \u2014 and that\u2019s why, look how unstable the world is. There are these three teenage kids who start that and then in the first year they start. And it\u2019s just shows how unstable -- and I like to say about religion, I like to misquote the priest Savonarola who was sort of a radical priest in Florence and who burned people at the stake if they weren\u2019t doing the right thing. He was called the scourge of God. That was his nickname and my statement is I say religion 1s the scourge of God. That\u2019s my feelings about it. Not that there might be something else about it. I\u2019m sure there are lots of things more that I can tell you that would be of interest but they don\u2019t come to mind at the moment."
