My name is Bill Benson, host of the museum's program First Person. Thank you for\njoining us. We are in our 15th year of the First Person program. Our First Person today is\nMr. Morris Rosen whom we shall meet shortly.\nThis 2014 season of First Person is made possible through the generosity of the\nLouis Franklin Smith Foundation with additional funding from the Helena Rubinstein\nFoundation. We are grateful for their sponsorship.\nFirst Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who\nshare with us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each of our\nFirst Person guests serves as a volunteer here at this museum. Our program will continue\nthrough mid-August. The Museum's website, www.ushmm.org, provides information about\neach of our upcoming First Person guests. Anyone interested in keeping touch with the\nMuseum and its programs can complete the Stay Connected card in their program, which is\nthis one, or speak with a museum representative at the back of the theater after our program\ntoday. In doing so you will also receive an electronic copy of Morris Rosen's biography so that\nyou can remember and share his testimony after you leave here today.\nMorris will share with us his First Person account of his experience during the\nHolocaust and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. If we have time at the end of our program,\nwe'll have an opportunity for you to ask Morris a few questions. We have prepared a brief\nslide presentation to help with his introduction.\nWe begin with a portrait of Morris Rosen, who was born Moniek Rozen, son of Jakub\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nRozen and Golda Chaya Warszawski in 1922. Morris was born in Dabrowa Gornicza in\nUpper Silesia, where his father was a distributor of tobacco and Acetylene. The arrow points\nto the location of Dabrowa.\nHere we have a 1924 portrait of one of Morris' sisters, Rozia Rozen Bilauer, who\nsurvived in the USSR during the war.\nThis photograph is of Morris and his friends on a hillside of Dabrowa. Morris is at\nthe top of the photo.\nAs you will hear, Morris survived several Nazi camps. After a six-week forced march\nhe arrived in the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany. The arrow points to the\nlocation of Buchenwald.\nEventually, in 1945, Morris was liberated from the Theresienstadt camp in occupied\nCzechoslovakia by the Soviet Army.\nWe close this brief slide presentation with a photograph of Morris with Regina\nZilberstein whom he met after the war. We might hear more about her if time allows this\nmorning.\nMorris came to the United States in 1949 and following seven years of art school\nbuilt a successful contracting business in Baltimore where he lives today. He is well-known as\na stamp, postcard, and letter collector, especially for his Holocaust Postal History collection,\nincluding those from Nazi-created ghettos in Poland. He is also recognized worldwide for his\ncollection on the Olympics and has traveled and lectured about his collection as part of the\nOlympic Games. He has exhibited at numerous U.S. and international exhibitions, including\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ;\nthe Nuremburg, Germany. He donated several items of his collection to this museum.\nMorris speaks frequently about his Holocaust experience at such places as the\nheadquarters in the Social Security Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid,\nand the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Fort Mead, Maryland. He speaks to\nnumerous students at Baltimore area schools and other locations. He will speak at Johns\nHopkins University, for example, this Friday.\nMorris was named the Baltimore-Washington, D.C. Man of the Year for the\nAmerican Red Cross. Morris, who lost his wife in 2000, has two sons and two grandchildren.\nAnd finally, | think you should know in addition to gardening, Morris works out three\ntimes a week doing Zumba, which combines Latin and international music with dance as an\nexercise program. He told me he's now added to that another form of dance and exercise\nwhich is even more vigorous than Zumba. He also mentioned to me that he is the only male in\neither class. Morris' doctor ordered him to no longer go on his steep roof to clean the gutter\nand do repairs.\nWith that, I'd like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Mr. Morris\nRosen.\n>> Bill Benson: Morris, good morning.\n>> Morris Rosen: Thank you, Mr. Benson, for your eloquent introduction. Hello and good\nmorning everybody. It is difficult to condense ideas of the darkest of mankind history into one\nhour. | wouldn't have enough in one day what | lived through in five years. | will do my best.\nBut | might have to skip a year or two.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\n>> Bill Benson: Start, if you don't mind, Morris, by telling us just a little bit about your family\nand your community before the war began.\n>> Morris Rosen: | lived with my family. | have a large family; eight children, my parents. We\nlived very nice with the gentile people. Our store was mostly 99% gentile people. But things\nchanged in 1939. The war started out September 1, 1939.\n| woke up in the morning, such a noise from the airplanes. | looked out the window\nand there were about 60 of them. | counted them. | was surprised. | didn't know they were\nGerman. A lot of people went out to hear what the noise was. Then | found out that the war\nstarted out and the planes went out.\nThe fifth column out in civilian clothing, with walkie-talkie, they could report\neverything to the enemy what's going on, where the Polish Army is, how many they have there\nin the Army, what kind of equipment they have. So on and so on.\n>> Bill Benson: Just so we understand, the fifth column was the name given to people of\nGerman decent who were living in Poland and now were providing all the information to the\nGerman Army.\n>> Morris Rosen: Not this. They spoke Polish. Some of them were caught. They were hung,\nall naked. They were not in uniforms. So they hung them.\nWhen | escaped --\n>> Bill Benson: You and your brother were warned to run away.\n>> Morris Rosen: We were warned to run away from the Germans, that they were chased out\nin Germany. They came to our city. They came in. The war started Friday. The sky was all\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nred from all the artillery and everything to run away. We ran away.\nBut the Germans, after six days, they caught us. So the first came, four motorcycles\nwith machine guns. They said, \u201cRefugees.\u201d So one of the German guys says, ok, we can go\nhome, in beautiful German. He says, \u201cHow do we know so well German?\u201d | says, \u201cWell, |\nwent to the university, I'm a German.\u201d Says, wait, we can't do nothing. But the end of the\ncolumn from the soldiers, they would take. That's what happened.\nWhen we came home, finally, after four days, walking back home, we found out that\nso many Jews were killed already on the way going home. That's what started out. And right\naway, occupied the 3rd of September. Only three days. It's only, by car, 20 minutes from the\nGerman border.\nRight away, we can't meet any more than two, three people. Jews have to walk on\nthe street, not on the pavement. And schools were closed up. Anybody caught with weapons\nor something, we would be punished by death. It was very bad.\nAfter 6:00 in the evening until 7:00 in the morning, nobody could walk on the street.\nlt doesn't make any difference. It was very difficult.\nThen came orders right away. | skipped a little bit. This was already in\nNovember 1939. Just the search, still bloody from the battles because put up 30-day battle.\nMore than any other European country. And they started out right away with Jews, they have\nto wear arm bands. We have to wear, first, white arm bands on the left hand, Star of David.\nLater on we changed because where we lived, Upper Silesia, was incorporated into the\ngeneral itself. So we have the same laws as the Germans. And we have to write letters -- you\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nhave to write everything in German. We have the German money, not the government money,\nthe Polish money, still. It was very difficult. We have to stay in line only for Jewish bakeries.\nOnly two bakeries. It was very, very difficult. But this was not the worst.\nThen came the order. Jews have to deliver in so much gold, so much silver, in order\nto pay for the German Army, for the occupation. People didn't have any gold or anything. It\nwas really we were about only 5% Jews in our city. We had 5,000 only. And there was 50,000\nPols. Who had gold? They had to give away their rings. You have to buy gold. You have to\ndeliver so much and so much. And this was not the worst.\nThen came another order. | skipped some. People had to live so many Jews,\nyoung people to work and they have to work for the Germans. So they start building\ncommunity there. We have to do everything what the German wants. And in order to get a\nlittle bit more food -- and of course, my father had to pay some money -- that | should work with\nmy father in the bauleitung, the building.\nFirst, you have especially ID cards that with you could walk on the street. We\nalready worked for the Germans, so they shouldn't catch us in the street or send away to\nGermany. That's what they did at that time. And we had a little additional food, also.\nMy first job was | became a carpenter, a painter, and a bricklayer. All| did. My first job,\nunfortunately, was in the market to put up hanging scaffolds for 10 people. | said this is wrong.\n>> Bill Benson: To make the hanging scaffolds.\n>> Morris Rosen: Yes. The next day police rather than around -- not soldiers but the German\npolice, they took away IDs from every person, Jew, not Jew, Pols, we have to come on the\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nmarket 10: 30 in the morning. You get back to IDs. If you don't come that day, you won't get\nIDs, you won't get food stamps.\nSo of course, the market was packed. We wait. They had a truckload with 10 Pols.\nThey wore masks. They committed things against the government, which it's not true. They\nwere condemned for hanging. And the thing what | saw there, the screams from them, \"Long\nlive Poland,\" \"Take revenge.\" And this they did in every city in Poland just to make sure that\nnobody does sabotage. And they were picked up from the Polish foundry in our city, which the\nlocomotives for the tanks were built there for the war. And during the war they made parts for\nairplanes. This was the first experience.\nThen | have to skip to 1942. They started out a ghetto. Nobody could go out for the\nghetto except with a special permanent. Like | work only for the Germans, | was free to go\neverywhere with my special ID card.\nCame an order that all the girls between 12 years and 25 have to register that\nthey're going to be working in the shop, potato shop there. And they have special IDs. But the\nthing was wrong. They came to the Jewish community there where 450, all the young\ngeneration in our city, Jewish girls, and came there and said send them to work. They took\nthem to a transition camp. We found out where they are. So my father went there. He\nthought he knows people, he can take you out. Nobody could tell. They took the girls and\nshipped them away. We didn't know where.\nYou can imagine our home, a 12-year-old girl, it was like coming home after a\nfuneral. My mother was crying. My father showed the bitterness. Everybody was terrible.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,\nAnd finally, after two weeks, we found out -- we got first postcard that she works in Lower\nSilesia in a factory where they make materials. She works 12 hours with the machine walking\nforward and back and gives to levenstein.\nWe understood they were the two Jewish bakeries that they could only bake bread\nfor the Jews. The Jews couldn't buy any other place bread. So my mother baked up whatever\nshe could. It wasn't easy until you got some flour on the back market, which wasn't allowed.\nYou got caught, you get shot. She made out some packages. It was allowed to send once a\nmonth a package. And | went to the post office because mine ID, could walk everywhere\nbecause | worked for the highest, highest German officials that existed in Silesia, only for\nthem. This was not the worst.\nCame August 12, 1942, again came order: Every Jew has to register near the\nJewish community, to be there at 5:00 in the morning. And you know in August how hot tt is in\nPoland. 5:00 with the rest of the families. We are going to get new IDs. You don't get IDs,\nyou won't get any -- and the Jewish community, either way, the head of the Jewish community\nput up clothing, look presentable. We were there 5:00 in the morning. The heat was\nunbearable. Kids were crying. People were panting from thirst. You couldn't go out until\n8:00 in the morning.\n8:00 in the morning, said to myself, oh, something doesn't look right. | saw soldiers\nwith machine guns on the roofs all around the community. Then came two trucks with SS and\na commission which at that time | worked for the highest official from the SS that was\nresponsible for sending out the Jews, Auschwitz, which | don't know what Auschwitz meant at\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection P\nthe time. We didn't Know, but he was responsible. There should be no Jews in the cities no\nmore in all Silesia. | worked for him at the time.\nWhen | was there, they put up tables and everybody, the head of the family have to\nStay first. The elder people, like over 45, go to the right. To the left were the ones with IDs,\nthat | worked for them, to the left. And the center were youngsters, barely able to walk. But\nthey don't have IDs yet. It took until 10:00. 10:00 they got all the Jews to the right: women,\nchildren, men, and they chased them to Bedzin.\nWe didn't have the keys to the house or anything. My father had everything. Then\nwe had to sleep outside. We couldn't get into our apartment. In the morning | found out where\nthey are. | went on foot. | didn't want to take the street car, though | had a special ID. | was\nafraid. It wasn't too far, about a half-hour | was there in the next city.\nCome there. It was only Jewish police there guarding them. | came up, and | saw\nthey didn't let me in. | said, \u201cIl don't have the key.\u201d And | saw they want Jewish policemen from\nour city. | only need to take the keys. Take only a minute. And when | came up, | saw the\nscene at the top | will never forget in my life. People were tearing their hair out. They knew\nwhat's going on. And my father gave me the keys to the house, gave me his pocket watch.\nMy mother cried. He says don't forget my sister who was already in camp. This is the last\ntime | saw her.\n| came back to work right away. | went to the same one. And my older brother and\nmyself walked there. We tell them we walk here, you can take our parents back? Oh, | find\nthem. Like you find them like he did. He didn't care much.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nOn the third day, | walked home separate and my brother. We shouldn't be all in\none place. | didn't go to the city home but to the field. | came to the field there and | see -- one\nwaived to me. His son was my best friend. And | waived back. So | saw that this was a\ntransport going away. | didn't know where. So there was police, SS, on the top of the train.\nThey started shooting at me because | waived. There was a ravine, so | jumped in. Lucky me,\n| jumped in there. | waited 10 minutes. Then | went home.\n| went home. We didn't even have time to cry. This was just before the high\nholidays. We got the sense that we got to move into the ghetto. Our part of the city didn't go\nto the ghetto yet. We went to the ghetto. There was only youngsters left for prayers, nobody\nto pray. Who prayed? We cried.\nSomebody looked at police. So they gave us one little room, 16 people. Nine girls\nand seven boys. A little room. The poor section of our city. No floor. So we have to get some\nstraw to put down for the girls. And one of the women was like a distant cousin. She was\npregnant. Yes, at that time. And we slept on the outside. When it rained, we stood in the\nfoyer because we didn't even have room to turn around. And what could you take? We didn't\nhave work. We took our books and so on. He was a collector of these items; some bedding,\nsome clothing. The rest we have to leave the house everything what it is. You couldn't take\nwith us.\n>> Bill Benson: I'm going to jump in for a minute. The one thing that | think you hung on to\nwere some photographs.\n>> Morris Rosen: Yes.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 5\n>> Bill Benson: Tell us about keeping your photographs as long as you -- you still had your\nphotographs.\n>> Morris Rosen: | still have all the photographs. This will come later. No, this | had.\nPhotographs, about 200 photographs. And still from my first girlfriend that | have in a different\ncity. | kept this right in front of it, with my family pictures, organizations, everything.\nThen we came to the ghetto. Like | told you, we slept outside when it rains; inside\nwe stood. After one week only | get invitation from the Jewish community. They handed me\ntickets for the train with a special pass on the train and go to Szczakowa, a leather factory. |\nwent to the train. | took all my pictures. That's all | took, and some things. And | came there,\nbut on the train | noticed one girl and neighbor. She was the daughter of the principal from the\nschool. And she shook like | shouldn't come over to her or nothing. | noticed she had a\nJewish kid that she took somewhere probably for hiding. | came there. It was a leather\nfactory. And all we have to eat was dry food, what the Jewish community sent us and bread. |\nwas picked with another guy because | spoke very good Polish. And we went once a week to\nthe bakery. We got bread, about 60 breads for the week for us.\nAnd suddenly, after two weeks, we didn't get any more food there. So what\nhappened, SS came 5:00 in the morning for us. We went a day before a church. And from the\nchurch | hear a whistle come over. Was a Jewish guy hiding. He says: Leave the breads\nhere. | know who you are. We are going to go through the church. Nobody knows we are\nhere. The Polish woman, she bring you food. | said no; the people are starving. We have to\ntake the bread. Maybe tomorrow. But 5:00 in the morning the SS came for us.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nWhat happened? It was no more Jews in all Silesia. Everybody was transported.\nNo Jews at all.\nSo my partner, electrician, very fine, intelligent guy, he was missing. He went with\nme for bread. He probably jumped out the window and probably went to the church. But |\ndon't think he survived. Otherwise | would have found him after the war.\nOk. We come there, came SS for us. There was a young woman about 23 years\nold. Her husband was the only Jewish engineer there. They couldn't lose him because he\nwas the only engineer that knew everything. But he went to see his brother. He didn't come\nback. So there was no more Jews.\nThe police took us. His wife, a young woman with a young kid, 2 years old only, |\nhelped her carrying the baby. She took her suitcase. And then | have pictures that | found\nwhile | worked for the SS men. We got on the third floor to put up heavy cases. And one case\nbroke. It was so heavy. Pictures came out. And all the pictures were Jews hanging, burning\nsynagogues, all over Poland. This was ready to be shipped to Germany. We quick put back.\nBut a couple of pictures, when | came for the next one, | know | hid them. And these pictures |\nwas afraid to keep. | would get killed if they found them. | told SS | need to go to the\nbathroom outside the station. And | threw it in the toilet. Not to be caught.\nAnd lucky me that when we came to Sosnowiec, | gave her the baby; otherwise it\nwas waiting on the car there. They took letter with the baby. If | would hold the baby, | would\ngo along with her. They were killed in Auschwitz. | would be the father.\nOur job was to empty out the ghetto there in Sosnowiec where all the Jews were in\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection |\nthe last days. On a separate mountain, led on a separate mountain every day. We worked\nthere 12 hours a day cleaning up. We came back. We slept on cement. Not even straw. We\ngot a slice of bread and a coffee.\nOn the third day came out, an SS officer, Ludwig, high officer. Is anybody painter\nhere? I'm 17 years old, skinny as can be. He's going to kill me. One of the guys said oh, the\nRosen's a painter. He calls me over. \u201cAre you a painter?\u201d | told him, \u201cI'm the best painter. I'm\nvery good painter.\u201d [Speaking German] Like to a dog you talk. He gave me right away in the\nface. | start the bleeding from the nose. Ok. | felt a little better. | came to myself and | told\nhim, \u201cI don't have no paint. | don't have no brushes. If you leave me there\u201d -- | have\neverything. | thought maybe | can escape there. You will have everything. He took two SS\nmen. They went to work. | stood two SS men and took to a paint store. We took paints,\neverything. They helped me move the furniture, everything.\nBefore | went, he took out his pistol to my temple and says | have three rooms to\npaint and three days. If I'm not finished, [Inaudible]. | painted at that time. | was sure this was\nthe end. | came to myself. And then when | went to the store. | came there. Who was there?\nHe had the mistress. She looked like a movie star; young, young Polish woman, tall, blond,\nabout 23, 24 years old. And that Nazi wasn't any taller than | am. Really. She didn't give me\nnot even hot water. My stomach was growling. | was: What kind Pol is she? She sees I'm\nhungry. | woke her up.\nSo what happened, | worked the first room, the dining room, the chandelier. So |\nwas very good in art school in my school. So | painted like around chandelier, with the snake\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\ncoming out with the open mouth. | had all of those paint, water colors that | had. | mixed the\npaints. And | thought maybe she will give me something. | cleaned off her kitchen. | brought\ncoal to her. Nothing doing. Tonight give me nothing. | cussed when | went out. What kind\nPolish is she? She knows I'm hungry. | worked so hard.\nNext day, | started second room. Who comes, Ludwig with the smile. Oh, he was\npleased. He calls me over. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d | told him I'm going on 17. \u201cWhen did you\nlearn so good to paint, the way how you paint is so beautiful?\u201d So | tell him -- you're a\nbusinessman. | told my father was the best painter in the city. We didn't have what to eat.\nWhen | was 6 years old instead of going to school, | had to work with my father. So we have to\neat. So that's why | went to work. | never had any school. He went away, comes back a half\nan hour late with a big bag, hands it to me. [Speaking German] Don't get caught with it. He's\ngot life and death | shouldn't get caught with it. He walked away.\n| looked in. It was a big salami, a round salami, kielbasa. It didn't take 10 minutes\nthe whole kielbasa was gone. | won't eat for nobody this. Bread, how much bread you can\neat? The loafs in Europe is two kilo; over four pounds. | took home. Bread | ate. And a cigar\nwas there. But! don't smoke. This was there. So| put away for the next day's. Covered\nover with papers, nobody take away. And the rest | took for my buddies, more half a loaf\nbecause those big breads, they don't have to eat.\nThe next day -- yeah? The next day the same thing. Then | became her maid. |\ncleaned for her the windows. Brought me -- | shouldn't get bloody on the hand. | cleaned.\nAfter two weeks he said, well, Morris, | don't send you to Auschwitz. | didn't know what\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,\nAuschwitz meant. But you go to a labor camp. [Speaking German]\nSo since he was so nice to me, | stood at attention. Like this. And | begged him. |\ndon't have nobody from my family. | only have one sister and she is in camp. Can you send\nme to this camp to be with my sister? [Speaking German]\nIt's a woman's camp. First | go to a transition camp. | won't tell anything. Too hard\nto mention. Then about a week later came a transport to go to Gruenberg. | am not on the list.\n| Knew where he went in. | am not on the list. So | jumped over the fence. It wasn't electrified.\n| Knocked at the door. And what a picture. He laid in his only underpants, no shirt, no pants,\nbut his boots. [Speaking German]\n| said, you promised me I'm going to Gruenberg. I'm not on the list. \u201cDas?\u201d | went\nlike a little doggy behind him to the fence. He tore up the list. Nobody goes.\nSo what happened, | found out, there was one Jew, Dr. Lieberman, he went over to\nChristianity in the 1930's. And he became the biggest anti-Semitic. He wrote semitic papers in\nPoland. But by the Germans he was considered a Jew. And he was there in that camp. So\nthey says, well, you think you are better person? You're stilla Jew. He got such a beating\nevery day. It was only Jewish couples. Only Jews. He was bloody all over. He paid so much\nthere to go out from here because he knew he was going to get killed there. And he took my\nplace. That's what happened. But we only went three people went to Gruenberg.\nCame on the train, everybody from the train has to go off because a Jew can't be\nwith the Germans together. Took about two hours on train. We came to Gruenberg. Who\nwas with it? The eldest of the Jews in the transition camp, very handsome, tall, yes. Anda\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nwoman, a Czech woman from Prague. She became a Christian also.\nWe arrived there. They brought about 18 Jews, men, from another camp they\nclosed up also in Gruenberg. So in order to see my sister | have to go through to the doctor.\nSo the first day after work they let me in there. And | saw my sister every day. | didn't -- right\naway when | came there, they took away my clothing and they gave me two new suits. We\nworked with the Germans together. Two new shirts. You have to be shaved, your hair\ncombed. Because worked with the Germans together. Beautiful suits, | tell you.\nAnd there was a nice, little old man, old German. So he said to me -- a painter. He\nwas a painter helper. [Speaking German] Don't worry, |am a Communist. Watch out for the\ndog. The boss he is an SS. | should watch out for him. He brought me every day like a little\npiece of bread. | don't have much. And a pill he says is a vitamin. But on Mondays he\nbrought me -- Sunday his wife baked something, brought me a piece. | had it good there.\nWe have our office where it was office of six girls working.

He\nbrought me loaf of bread. \u201cEvery day you come to my office.\u201d That's what Ludwig told him to\ndo. But it didn't last long.\nTwo weeks later we couldn't be anymore with the women there because it became a\nconcentration camp. And they took us on trucks, two trucks, 80 people. We come there. It\nwas winter time. Cold as can be in February. And came like a white animal. He was dressed\nin leather pants, leather jacket, with the beret and with the scar like this. And he started hitting\nleft and right: Get, quick, get quick out from the trucks. We formed a circle. And he said if you\nhave watches, money, diamonds, money, you put everything in the center out. He grabbed\ntwo guys, stepped on their throats and killed them. That's how we're going to look.\nSo, of course, in German: They didn't do nothing. Why did you kill them? He\npushed them in the dirt also on the wet snow. So an SA says, don't you know, he's the -- he\npushed them into the snow.\n>> Bill Benson: This camp that you're at now was a subcamp of Auschwitz.\n>> Morris Rosen: No. Not Auschwitz.

So | knew which they put in.\n2:00 in the morning, it was pouring raining. There was no electricity. Because\nwhere we came into the barrack, there was no windows yet. The cement was still wet.

Three painters.\nThey were not even painters. They didn't know about paint. Helpers. A painter was a\nGerman. Then he came there.\nSo right away they made a fire. Baked potatoes there.

The Russian Army were very close. So they said we\ndon't go to work. Everybody takes a blanket and everybody got a loaf of bread with some\nmarmalade, margarine, and we started walking. Go into woods. We walked for about eight\nhours. We come out from the woods to a little city. We see German soldiers retreating. They\ncame. \u201cWhy don't you even go? Don't you see the war is almost over? What do you want for\nthem?\u201d They don't know. They have different orders. They took us back to the woods.\nWe walked another eight hours, 16 hours walking. | had swollen legs from the\nwalking. | could hardly walk but somebody helped me. And other people wouldn't walk, got a\nbullet in the head. The woods were full with dead people. Who could walk that much? We\nwere hungry, skeletons. | had better than anybody else, but they were skeletons. Walked 12,\n14 hours a day with a little slice of bread and black coffee and this was the food.\nAnyway, | came to myself. So the second night it was winter, cold, snow,\neverything. We went to sleep in the barn. We sleep in the barn. There was food for the\nhorses and cows. Everybody helped themselves that they finished off all the food what was.\nThe farmer complained. They ate up all the food | prepared for the horses and cows. For\npunishment, we didn't sleep anymore in the barn but on the outside in the snow. We huddled\nup.\nAfter two weeks walking, we went by --\n>> Bill Benson: Just so -- our audience knows this.

Everybody had\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nto get under it, everybody, lice, no washing, dirty. We slept one on another because it was\ncold. We got to get undressed and jump into the water, wash ourselves and wash your\nclothing. Ok. Washed ourselves.\nHave a nice bunch of friends. Eight people. Only intelligent people. We never\nmentioned food in camp. If you mention food, you are hungry. Only what book did you read?\nDid you have a girlfriend? What movie did you see? Highly intelligent friends | had. It helped\nbecause when we came out of the water, we rubbed our back, jumped around. Then \"Get\ndressed.\" Put on my pajama. It was only a pajama. No underpants no undershirt. Wooden\nshoes without socks. And | put on my pants. It was like a board. It falls. So | was warm on\nthe left side -- like walking shorts. The other one | pulled apart, little by little.\nLet me tell you, about three, four days later, about 400 people died from the cold.\nNo eat. No nothing. Then finally we come up hill to the camp. Like you say, no good person,\nhe starts screaming, \u201cWalk like soldiers.\u201d Well, he was number two when they opened up the\ncamp for killing. He was a murderer. That's what they picked to be in the camps, murderers.\nHe started hitting left and right. One, two, three. And we should start singing. Who\nhad power to sing? We were tired. We couldn't walk. We were hungry. We came to the gate.\nWho was at the gate? Only communists. Political prisoners. When he arrived, \u201cAre you better\nthan them?\u201d They put them down to the ground. He got a beating from all the Kapos there.\nThey left us. He got bloodied all over his eyes. He says, \u201cNow we are going to kill them\ninside.\u201d Soon he comes out, but we didn't have the luck. We went in. He was still there.\nFinally somebody saw him at the other end of Buchenwald. He got out from the dead person\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 3\nthe uniform. So we couldn't catch him, anything.\nAnd the smell in Buchenwald was unbelievable. What you smell -- they give us the\nfirst food, so a bunch of people, they came, call people. They grabbed your food. We didn't\neat for so many days. I'm all the time, you know, about the situation. What is it? The smell, |\nwant to see where the smell comes. | went to the left where eight mountains, about six, seven\nfeet high, with bodies. And some people were still alive. | come there to look at it. One guy\nchased out from Germany, lived in our city. | played with him in the Maccabiah, ping-pong,\nchess, everything. He was laying on the top. He was in our camp, but he was planting flowers\nby the SS so he had a lot of food to eat. But on the Death March, he didn't have food so\nthey're the ones that died first. The ones that were used to hunger, they held out. So he was\non the top with one eye closed, almost. He says, \"Don't worry\" [Inaudible].\nThen | saw for the first time cannibalism. Two guys with knives cut out from bodies\nthat are still alive. | said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d So he came with the knife for me. | ran away.\nAs | ran away, there was an order. \u201cAll the Jews out!\u201d Everything. | says, \u201cWhat all the Jews\nout?\u201d The Americans brought in Air Force near Buchenwald. | said, \u201cI'm not going out.\u201d So |\nSaw a guy jump into the -- the walls.

It was full of glass. People were barefoot that didn't have shoes\ncut themselves. It wasn't a building where a painter should be in the window. Everything from\nbombing. Everything destroyed. They load us in in open wagons, about 120. No food, no\nnothing on the train.\nOk. We were so tight that we have to stay in cold as can be. Don't forget it was\nMarch. Very, very cold. And what we have? Pajamas. No food. No water. Nine days. We\nthrew out bodies every night. Finally we slept on the bodies because it was so cold to lay\ndown. So we slept on the bodies.\nOn the ninth day we come. The train stopped. We begged them for water. They\nput the locomotive buckets of water. So we begged them.

And they machine gunned on\nthe locomotives. They saw that this is prisoners. And there were so many, about eight\ndifferent trains, all with prisoners from all over Germany. And they start shooting up the\nlocomotives. And finally, two of them got wounded. And people started jumping out. | think\nmaybe we can escape. No, there was transport soldiers.

I'm going to be -- you want, you can join me.\nCome in here.\nOf course, we didn't have more to go so we walked. We started walking. We came.\nEverything was on fire. You probably read that over 100,000 were killed. Says, oh -- when we\nwere bathing here in the water, in the river, in the Elbe River, now everything is on fire.\nFinally, on the seventh day we arrived to Theresienstadt. We arrived 11:00 at night.\nThey were full of transports from all over Germany. Cold as can be. They couldn't take us into\nsleep, so we slept on cobblestones. But they gave each one hot soup with a lot of bread. And\nthis was good.\nThe next morning, they took us into barracks. They took off our clothing because it\nwas dirty, filthy.

They\ndidn't give them no food. Only like babies they feed them. The Russian came with the same\nfood the Army ate: bacon, meet meat, potatoes, sauerkraut. You don't eat two, three weeks,\nthe stomachs are shrunk, so you die. That's why you have so many dead. That's why Typhus.\nThen somebody calls me. Who was there?
