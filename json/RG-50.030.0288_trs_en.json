Anybody wouldn't have no shovel is going to get killed. But everybody was grabbing -- the shovels, and was maybe 20 left over. And we started to work. Same day we work. And physically, I was built good, strong. People, other people in the town they never did a hard work 1n their life. The skin of their -- it was soft. If you started to use a shovel for a long time, you get blisters on the fingers. You can't work. They couldn't produce. So, they were working; they couldn't produce.

Bring in and some notes that they gave. \u201cWe are working on it, you're going to be free. You're going free, you're going free.\u201d I had opportunity to run away that time, also. Because- but I didn't want to run away because I was afraid for my family. Because if they know I run away, they know where I came. They going to punish my family. They were waiting and waiting. And when we got hope, 'til the time came, and they took, they took us out, all of them, about a couple hundred -- about a hundred people -- 120 people -- and they stood us in line and said, \"Who wants to go home, and who wants to stay here?\" Everyone wants to go home. So I went in the line -- \u201cI want to go home.\u201d Right after, they didn't let us go. They let us go and I went in the -- back to sleep. And I was laying in the bed and something came into my mind. If they going to be free, I'm going to be free -- a week later, two weeks later. I went back to the line, I want to stay. So those people, they separated. They took them a different place. I never saw them again. They took them a different place and started to bring in the cars with Jews to kill them off. Those people were with the dead ones. And I was working with the working people. They have to build beds for the -- and build barracks for them, I was working for them. That's why I was working. And they used to bring -- every day they started to bring in a hundred cars, and each car was that -- a hundred people in each car. In the beginning they didn't -- when they came off the car, I wasn't there. Only the workers, if they needed something to fix, I was -- I used to go up there. There was some soon as they got off the car, the people were glad they were coming off, because a hundred people in the car and the trip used to take four or five hours. They'd keep them for 24 hours. It made them so weak, they were -- they couldn't -- they didn't care anymore. So they told them, the first thing, take off the jacket. After -- and the overcoat, then the jacket. And 'til they came to the end, they were naked. And they were in line to go, they were put in the concentration camp, in the chamber, the gas chamber. I saw the gas chamber before they started to build because I was there and was doing some work there. And I couldn't, because my destination, I couldn't even think about it. There was going to be something to kill people. I thought it was looked like a shower. Looked -- openings on the ceilings like water will come, you know. That's what I figured.

They couldn't walk; they had to shovel on their behind because they couldn't walk on their feet any more. And nobody wanted -- would get involved. I didn't blame the people, the Polish people because they find out somebody helped a Jew, they came in, they took them out, they killed them, they burned the barns, they burned the house, they burned everything. So they were afraid. I don't blame them, those people. I blame the people went around to show where a, where a Jew lives. Where you could find a Jew, for a pound of sugar. Those people were -- those people didn't want to help. Everybody was looking for his own life."

And they said I was a spy. He was talking German but I'm Jewish, I understand a little bit. He took me in on the wagon and, \u201cCome with us.\u201d I went with him. And on the way going, was a telephone. The field telephones, you know. He takes up a shovel, told me to dig. And so he told me to dig a grave for me. He told me -- he showed me what he wants.

That was the court that I was a witness for at that time frame. This Keloa-- of course, nobody has the same name, real name. Didn't call them by the real name because we make the different name because they shouldn't know what we're talking about. You see, that's what I mean, change the name to another name. I know it and that second fellow know it over there, but the German didn't know then we call it when we mention his name."

They disinfected the clothing, the places there, the clothes; the Germans did this. That day we found out that they have some gasoline. Instead of putting in disinfection, we told them to put in the gasoline inside in the tanks. They set it go around, spraying with that thing with the disinfection, they spray it with this. It wasn't so easy to catch on fire because we didn't have too many matches to spare. So we had it burning there. After -- I was running, I see it burning, in fact, one German got killed. I didn't look back, didn't want to look back because I was running."

            "answer": "No, but we didn't storm the gates. Everybody was outside the gates. They were working outside the gates, not inside. Most of the people like me, I was inside the gate because our shops were inside the gate. The shoemaker was inside his gate. The locksmith was inside the gate. The rest of the people worked at different places outside the gates, under the supervision of Ukrainians or Germans. We were inside the gates, working."

            "answer": "Nothing, no other plan could we do. The best plan we had was to just run away from -- they were outside the gate and everyone could run. But the only way of this would be we were all together, and we couldn't stay all together. We couldn't -- even we could keep ourselves together, 1t was a very big risk to stay ourselves together, because we could be caught. As a matter of fact, a day after I was running away, I was afraid to stay somewhere, I was in the fields. Not even the farms, because I was afraid they going to come and look all over for us. So I was not able to live with this risk. So this was no -- any risk was nothing. Only we couldn't help each other. Everybody was solo there. Everybody was saying they couldn't. I couldn't have helped anybody if I had no way, I can't help myself. I can't help it, though."

            "answer": "They was shaking. I saw -- like I told you before. One general was standing with a gun; he couldn't shoot. He was shaking. He was afraid. They only were not afraid when they had the gun above us. When they started to -- we could have -- didn't have to run nowhere and burn, they all think and kill them all of the Germans, but we had the courage, see. The resistance was so low, but this was a desperate people, they were afraid to do anything. And another thing, as a matter of fact, the Germans used go around, \"When you going run? You going to run now? Where you going to run? Where will you go? You have nowhere left to go.\" This is a Safe place, you stay there...that's what they tell me."

            "answer": "The image I'm stuck with, the people around the whole world how did they let it happen like this? The United States knowing about it. The Arab countries know. England knowing about because they had spies all over. They told them everything. Why did they wait until they killed off six million? Why they didn't do this before? Why they didn't do -- they could have done something to spoil the whole thing. But then nobody did anything, nobody wanted to do anything. Because it was only Jews involved, not -- but they didn't know how many other nations got killed, also. The Czechoslovakian, Polish, all the country. Anybody said anything to them, they killed them. Even Gypsies, what did the Gypsies do, didn't set a, you know, set a trap for the German people. They didn't do that. They put them in a concentration camp. I saw them coming in. They came in with -- they were looking around. They didn't know what's happened to them, Gypsies."

            "answer": "Personally, I wanted to see what -- either it's going to happen, after everything is over, I want to see. Everything I was fighting for, I want to see what they were going to do to the German people, what they were doing to the other people. All the other people, like the -- what's the name, the Arabs. They helped the Germans. The other thing I wanted to see somebody that's a friend of theirs, everything was -- I was so much disappointed after everything was over. I looked and then what did it do to Germany? They got a few people, they gave them a trial, few people. The most of them, they knew all of this came in. Well, clothing came into Germany that didn't know, didn't ask no questions from where it comes? A lot of everything was getting, the gold, the Germans take a vacation. Sent satchels full of gold and diamonds to Germany every couple of months to get 1t away. The Germans didn't get nothing from anybody, from the Jews. Half a million Jews got killed in Treblinka. So everybody had something, a chain or earrings or anything. They know, but they didn't -- everybody kept quiet at the size clothes. End of Tape #4 Conclusion of Interview"
