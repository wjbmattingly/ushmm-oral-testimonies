Most of the Jewish people that lived in Wierzbnik were religi ous, and I always saw Polacks, throwing stones at them, talking to them in a way that it was ridiculing them, and so - I, personally, since I was just a child at the time, I didn\u2122t feel it, and being with the Polish girls, you know, associating with them, I didn\u2122t feel it, but I saw it on the outside, and that\u2122s why maybe I wanted to be one of them."

They spoke mostly, among themselves, they spoke Yiddish, and being so very religious, they had a certain mannerism that distinguished them for the other people. They were dressed differently. They acted differently. They spoke differently. So, but I identified with them, but sometimes I felt a little bit uncomfortable with them."

That total population was 35,000, and ten percent of it were Jewish people like between 3,200 to 3,500. And, most of them lived in Wierzbnik; some Poles lived in Wierzbnik, too. Starachowice was mostly - in Starachowice, there were mostly - not mostly, I would say almost 95 percent Poles. They worked there because we had the munition factory there. They worked there and they lived there. Some of them lived in Wierzbnik, too, but all Jews lived in Wierzbnik."

            "question": "Was that an ordinary th ing? Why did that happen?",
            "answer": "No, because I was a good stude nt and we had what they call Gymnasium, which was a high school in Starachowice, but it wasn\u2122t one of the best. In Radom, there was - there was one of the best girls\u2122 school, but it was almost impossible to get in for the Jews. At first, we had numerus klausus (ph), which meant one Jewish girl for 45 students in a class would be accepted, and then in the later years it was numerus nolus (ph), which means none of the Jewish girls could be accepted. So, I was lucky. You have to pass a competitive exam, and you had to really be very, very good to be accepted. So, my mother tried - she sent me there and I passe d the exam, and at the end of the year, she found out that I was accepted. So, for her it was the biggest achievement that she could ever achieve at the time which - and I went to that school there and I lived on my own. Like, I had relatives, but my mother placed me in a - like she rented a room, with like there were kids there my age. So, she rented a room with a family, and that\u2122s where I stayed."

            "answer": "At first it did. As a matter of fact, I crie d for a long time before I went there, and when I found myself there, I also felt a little bit st range, but soon I got used to it, and I got to know all the people my age and a year older or a year younger, because they were several schools in Radom. It was a big city with 100,000 people there. They had several different schools. They even had a Jewish high school, called Pzhiachu Wierze (ph), which meant 5 \ufb01friends of knowledge\ufb02, if I were to translate it exactly. So, there were a lot of Jewish kids that were educated in Starachowice, Wierzbnik. The religious people didn\u2122t send the girls to high school because of the fact that they had to go to school on Shabbat. You know, because we had six days of school. So, the parents wouldn\u2122t let them do that. So, they had a lot of other schools that were connected with the religious movement. But in Radom, the parents were a littl e bit - I mean, it was a bigger city, and there was a lot of young people that were going to those different schools, and the schools were much better than in Wierzbnik."

So, at the beginning, I didn\u2122t want to go back to Radom because when I was at home it felt so good to be at home. So, the first month, I wa s traveling every day to Radom and back."

And they taught us - they taught us to such a degree that when I went to public school, the transferred me immediately the first day because I could read and write already, and then I skipped again, because they were very good teachers and they were very good friends of our parents.

            "answer": "You know, like, when I think of it now, I didn\u2122t have any idea that it\u2122s going - that it could be so bad. Like, we didn\u2122t really - we didn\u2122t know what was going on around us, like in Warsaw. We heard it, but we didn\u2122t want to believe it, to believe in it. But we were more scared then than at the beginning, because at the beginning we lived a little bit more normal, but now we had to watch ever y move that we made because we\u2122re not allowed to get out of the ghetto. We were w earing those - we wearing the armband with the Jewish star in it, and if they catch you outside of the ghetto, they would kill you. I heard that. I had a case where I was very foo lish. I had a boyfriend at the time who lived in Busko Zdroj. It was - but that was around \u212241 already, and the parents invited me to come there, and Jews weren\u2122t allowed to trav el. So, they had hotels there. It was a place like where they had cures for arthritis and they owned hotels there. The Germans took away their hotels, but they worked there as wo rkers. So, they send me a work order that I was supposed to work in the hotel. That was just - it was just for the purpose of me being able to go, to travel. So, I remember I went to Kielce, which was a place where the train stopped, and like when I say stopped, the train line stopped and there were buses going to Busko, and I couldn\u2122t get on this train. I c ouldn\u2122t get on the bus because they sent the Jews to the very end, and I was wearing this band, and the Jews to the very end. So, I was waiting the whole day there, and all the time, th e Jews to the very end, I had to stay in line. So, I decided - I didn\u2122t have any fear at the time - I decided to just hitchhike to Busko, because I figured I couldn\u2122t do anythi ng else. So, what did I do? I took off my band, put it in my purse, and then I stood on the corner and a car stopped and it was a guy, a German-speaking guy. He asked me if I would like a lift, and I said, \ufb01Yeah.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Where are you going?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01To Busko.\ufb02 So, he says, \ufb01Get in.\ufb02 So, I get in, and he started speaking to me. He asked me - I didn\u2122t know who he was. I had no idea. It was a German. I was scared to death. That\u2122s the first time I was scared, but I was already sitting there. So, he started asking me wher e am I going. I said, \ufb01I go there.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01For what?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I\u2122ve got a job there.\ufb02 \ufb01What\u2122s your name ?\ufb02 So, of course, I gave a Polish name because I was afraid Laks was a Je wish name. I couldn\u2122t say that my name is so and so. So, anyway, what he was, he was like a troihinder (ph) of the Jewish 14 businesses. What it meant - the Germans took away the Jewish businesses, and he was like - he was checking on all those businesses, and among others, he was checking on this family that I was going to. So, I told him that I\u2122m going to work there, and that was okay. So, he stopped in a place called Miernic (ph) because he had some business to do there. So, he asked me to sit in th e car and he would take me because he was going to Busko. So, a Polish guy - in each city they had a Po lish supervisor, in each town and city like on his way because he was the main one. He was in charge of it, but the Polacks were supervising those Jewish businesses. The Polack recognized me that I was Jewish. He recognized me. He didn\u2122t tell me anything, although I spoke Polish perfectly, and I thought I didn\u2122t look Jewish. He recognized that I was Jewish. So, when the guy came back, I noticed that he went and he told him, and this fellow - he was so nice to me all the way - he came and he says, \ufb01 Bist du eiben?\ufb02 So, I said, \ufb01Yah.\ufb02 So, he screamed - do you understand what that means, \ufb01 Bist du eiben.\ufb02 - \ufb01Are you Jewish?\ufb02 So, I said, \ufb01Yes.\ufb02 So, he said, \ufb01Wo hast du die Armband?\ufb02 That means, \ufb01Where is your band?\ufb02 So, I was stupid - at that time I was crystal clear like as far, I was so idealistic. I never lied, and I was so well brought up. So, I took my purse, and I took it out and showed it to him. He took me by the collar, threw my out, threw my suitcase. The suitcase fell apart, and he took - it\u2122s a good thing he didn\u2122t kill me because he could have. He was so embarrassed, you know, in front of the Polack, the Polish supervisor that he didn\u2122t know what to do. So, he ran to the car so fast, and then the Polish guy comes to me and says, \ufb01Do you have anywhere to go in Miernic?\ufb02 So, I said to him, \ufb01As a matte r of fact I do. I know a doctor here, and his name is Dr. Reichman.\ufb02 And I remember and he says, \ufb01I can take you.\ufb02 So, he carried my suitcase. He carried my suitcase to Dr. Reichm an there. He wasn\u2122t even embarrassed. He caused all the trouble, because otherwise I wouldn\u2122t have had any trouble. I\u2122m telling you only how - not only that I was idealistic, but I was so na\u00efve, and I\u2122ll tell you, stupid to a certain point because, I mean, I didn\u2122t do anyt hing wrong. I just took a\u2013hitchhiked. So, I don\u2122t know what I was referring to when I told you the story when you asked me."

So, the parents started coming and asking whether I could give them lessons. So, I had two sisters. So, I figured I\u2122ll open this - it wasn\u2122t a school - whoever wanted to come, like, people that were more or less on that level, on Renia\u2122s level I had a few, and on Chris\u2122s level I had a few, and Chris was teaching. She was also teaching, but she was teaching younger kids, and I was good at schoo l because when I was in Radom, I had a French teacher who just, I don\u2122t know, she liked me, loved me. So, when people had problems with the French language - and I learned very fast - so when people had 18 troubles, she says, she made me a tutor. S o, right from the beginning almost. And, if I was their tutor, they passed. No, but most likely, I could do it. So, you know, I had a little bit of experience from Radom. So, when I came home during the war, my pupils were very happy with me. Some of them were until today - as a matter of fact, I went now to the Wierzbnik Society meeting and I met tw o of my pupils. They kissed me and went, \ufb01My lovely teacher.\ufb02 And I was not very much older than them."

So, I remember all the French Canadians, they speak perfect Fr ench. I wasn\u2122t - my French was only from school, so I couldn\u2122t speak so fluently, but I remember grammar and everything much better, and one day the teacher comes when we were taking La Fontaine, that\u2122s a French poet, and he says, \ufb01Does any of you remember any poems?\ufb02 And, remember that this is years and years after; that was when I was already Canada and we came here in 1948, and I didn\u2122t go to school until 1970.

And she did the best she could. She washed my laundry every week. I sent her my laundry to be washed at home because I didn\u2122t have the facilities. And every week she would send me the home baking and the best she could, she could afford to buy at the time: some fruits that were imported that were so expensive that only th e sick ones would get them sometimes. And I was very good at school, so I had no problem there. I always had straight A\u2122s. My parents were very proud of me; they were always br agging. And I also tutored French, and I was paid for those lessons, so this was my spe nding money. We could go to a movie or for ice cream, like, we were going in groups, but it was expensive, so I could afford to pay for it because I was making some money there. And fo r holidays, I usually used to come home, but for the Yom Kippur and the Rosh Hashan a, I not always could because it was the beginning of school and I didn\u2122t want to miss - don\u2122t forget, I was the only Jewish girl in our class, so I couldn\u2122t afford to miss a week of school at the very beginning. So, I remember, one year I was living with the prof essor, the professor\u2122s family, and for the holidays, I also had an aunt living, an aunt and uncle in Radom. My uncle was the brother of my father, but I di dn\u2122t live with them. I lived with this family. And the lady of the house asked me what am I going to do for the holidays. So, I couldn\u2122t say \ufb01nothing\ufb02 because I didn\u2122t want to be invited by them, because it is a family holiday and they had their family. So, she says, \ufb01What are you going to do?\ufb02 So, I said to her, \ufb01My aunt invited me for dinner.\ufb02 So she said, \ufb01Oh, that\u2122s good.\ufb02 So when they sat at the table, I went out 22 on the street, and you know, that was - all the smells were so, I mean, so inviting everywhere. And I wasn\u2122t invited to my aunt\u2122s for the holidays. I was walking the streets until I got tired, and I sat down on a stone somewhere near the road and started crying. I cried myself to death. I was so hungry and I was thinking of the house and I was envious of my sisters being there, you know, with the whole family and eating well and all. So, I really felt very bad and I couldn\u2122t go home un til they finished the dinner because I went to my aunt\u2122s officially, so when I came home , and they were already - I heard the dishes being washed and put away - and I went to bed. I was so hungry. I was so hungry, so I cried all night. That\u2122s how I remember one of the incidents of being independent."

So, my aunt says to my mother, \ufb01What do you expect? Y ou come from a small town there, and you come from Wierzbnik, that they\u2122ll accept you with open arms? First of all, she has to pass as the best exam because she\u2122s Jewish. Secondly, what do you expect? They have in Radom a lot of people that they know, and they\u2122re prominen t people, that they\u2122ll accept you?\ufb02 And she says, \ufb01The hair will grow on my wrist if she would be accepted.\ufb02 So, anyway, towards the end, my mother registered - at the same time, she re gistered me at the Jewish gymnasium. And when she came to look at the re sults, she went by herself because she was sure that I won\u2122t be accepted. So, she went there and, sure enough, I was accep- my name was there, so she fainted. And then my aunt and the whole family wanted to be sure that this is true, they all went to see whether it\u2122s true. But that wasn\u2122t the only - I talked to her many times.

            "answer": "Well, that\u2122s also, some - all the teachers we re - the French teacher was Catholic, but she was converted. She was really Jewish. She loved me - I had no problems with her. And the teachers in general liked me because I was a good student. Like, even in Latin, I was getting harder work, like when we had an exam at school, she would put me at the end of the class with a longer exam because she didn\u2122t want me to sit there while the others were still struggling. So, the teachers liked me b ecause I was a good student. As a matter of fact, there was a mathematics teacher, her na me was Kostetska (ph). Nobody ever had a - like, we had numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, so 5 was th e best, you know, it\u2122s like \u201avery good\u2122 here. I was the only one that, throughout the school, I used to get 5. My friend still today says, \ufb01If you got a 5 from Kostetska (ph), you\u2122re lu cky.\ufb02 So, the teachers all liked me, but the secretary - the secretary, whenever I went th ere, she made very bad remarks to me. One day, she says, \ufb01What\u2122s your name?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Anna Laks.\ufb02 She says, \ufb01Your name isn\u2122t Anna. Your name is Hannah.\ufb02 I says, \ufb01No, my name is Anna.\ufb02 And she says, \ufb01No, your name is Hannah.\ufb02 And she emphasized the \u201aH\u2122 because she couldn\u2122t stand it that my name was Polish while I was Jewish. And she was mean to me, but I mean, I didn\u2122t come in contact with her too much, only when I ha d to bring my parents\u2122 check for the tuition. But I did feel a little bit of anti-Semitism, but I disregarded it completely because most of the girls were really nice to me. There was 45 of us and we met after school, and then there were dances. I didn\u2122t have any pr oblem because - there was a similar men\u2122s gymnasium under the same name as ours - so, once a year we had a dance, so they put all the boys in a row and the girls in a row, and whoever you met you had to dance. So, I never had any problems, but I heard from a friend - as a matter of fact we just talked the other day about it - from a male friend that, he was standing across from one Polish girl and she was so cute, and then she says, \ufb01I don\u2122t dance with Jews.\ufb02 He says he felt so bad because it never happened before because he was a good-looking boy. So, there were - but as I said, the few incidents that were happening to me I tried to disregard because otherwise I couldn\u2122t live with them. I was the only one!"

He noticed me working in the office there, and so he was always telling us things, that the ghetto is going to be liquidated. But he didn\u2122t tell us when; he only told us that it\u2122s going to be liquidated. Anyway, towards the end, the last time he came to the office, he told us that the ghetto is going to be liquidated the day later than in real ity it was. So, we had an idea.

            "answer": "We are expecting the liquidation of the ghetto a day later. My mother prepared everyone of us had a knapsack, I mean, whatever, so that when we are going to work anywhere, it was a little bit of clothes, you know, and it was - but a change - some shoes maybe or so. So, everybody had it ready for the next day. But, unfortunately we went to work in our work clothes for the night, not knowing that the liquidation would be that night. So, we didn\u2122t take anything with us, only the way we were. And at night we noticed on the roof of the factory, like through the window - through the roof - above the roof of the factory, we saw people walking toward the station, walking, and Germans with dogs and we were wondering what happened. So, we knew that the liquidation is going on, and we tried to - I mean, it wasn\u2122t far from the station, but we couldn\u2122t - we only saw lots of people walking slowly with kids, but we didn\u2122t see any of our relatives or friends. We tried to. They told us that we will go straight to camp. At that time, we had three ready camps to move in. Strzelnica, which was the biggest camp, Majowka, which was the smallest camp. So, just to give you an idea, let\u2122s sa y in Strzelnica, they could keep a thousand people. Majowka was about five hundred. I mean, it\u2122s not exact, but just to give you an idea that Majowka was a smaller camp, and th ey had a third camp called Tartak (ph). This camp - it was a sawmill and they only had room for about a hundred workers. So, some people, as you know, from the marketplace , they all went to Strzelnica, the ones that were chosen to work. The ones that were chosen to die, at that time nobody knew where they were going, went to the train station. We were sent direct to Majowka, and in Majowka this Pohl, guy was the Lagerf\u00fchrer. He was in charge of that Lager. So, when we arrived there, he right away - I mean, si nce he knew that I had experience, he put me in his office. I don\u2122t remember what Krysia was to do. Then, we found out that - we didn\u2122t know who survived. We didn\u2122t know whet her Renia was alive, whether my father was alive - I didn\u2122t know that, whether my mother is alive. We had no idea. We were sent to Majowka, and Renia and Father were sent to Strzelnica. Of course, my father went to the office right away because they knew him also from the Arbeitsamt. And I don\u2122t remember whether that day or some other da y we found out that my mother didn\u2122t make it, that she was sent out togeth er with the other people. We believed that they were sent somewhere else. We never believed that th ey were going to Treblinka although we heard about Treblinka many times, but in our mind, we couldn\u2122t believe that atrocities like that could happen. So, life was hard. Like, the people that went to Strzelnica, started going to work right away. I don\u2122t remember what Kr ysia did. Maybe she was working with\u2013 I don\u2122t know. I don\u2122t remember where she worke d. A few days later, and Vaschek (ph) was in charge of the other Lager, came to inspect what - because he was actually in charge of the two Lagers; Pohl was in the smaller camp. He came to the office. He looked at my work, and he says, \ufb01You know wh at?\ufb02 I think that because he liked the way I wrote those lists, you know, those - we started - what did we do at the office? We kept 30 records of all the people that lived there. Everyone had a card. On the card, it was his name, the barrack number, because, I mean, th e date of birth, and the barrack number, and where he worked. Then, from those cards, we were making up lists - daily work lists - because they were different departments in the factory and those workers, like, in the morning, you would call the names and they would go to those, and the next day maybe they were changed. So, I was making all those lists. So, I remember Vaschek (ph) liked the way I make the lists and he says, \ufb01From now on,\ufb02 he sent my father. So, Krysia was with my father, and since Renia was in Strzelnica, I was sent to Strzelnica to do the work there, to work in the office. Now, I\u2122ll just mention it, because if somebody died, was killed, whatever, most of the people were very strong, the ones that committed themselves to work, so they didn\u2122t die the nor mal way. Most of them were either killed here or there. We used to write down in the Polish \ufb01deceased\ufb02, and we kept the cards separate. Otherwise, we knew exactly how ma ny people we have in each camp. Tartak (ph) was a separate unit. They had their own office and their own people. They - it wasn\u2122t connected. But those two camps were connected."

They were in charge, you know, of - they were responsible for the kitchen and for the supplies and, you know, in general - the Germans would dump the food and dump it, and th ey were in charge of all those, I mean, they were running a camp where was a thousand or over people. So, they had to be fed, they had to be clothed, they were bringing the clothes at one time and just dump it. And at the office, let\u2122s say, I and maybe another tw o or three girls to help were giving out the clean stuff for the people, like because, you know, and they were responsible for the inside of the camp. And there was a lot of - there was a lot of bribery going on. They had to pay the Germans off for this and for whatev er. They did the smallest favor, they were collecting whatever they could collect. A nd a lot of the Germans were only asking for bribes. Now, what was - so, the guards - I\u2122ll go back now to the guards - the guards were watching the gate. There was a tower, one tower near the gate where they watching, and as I said, they were taking people to work and from work, and they were transporting whatever had to be transported. Now, the guards were Ukrainians. Then there were Germans, heads of the guards. So, there was three of them. There was Schrodt - he was famous and notorious and I\u2122ll tell you stories about him - Schleizier and Wolf. There were three shifts. So, a German was responsib le for the guards. Then, we had - we had the Lagerf\u00fchrer , which was responsible for the camp. He lived outside of camp, but he was there all day. That was in Strzelnica. I\u2122ll talk about Strzelnica because I was there the longest. His name was Vaschek (ph). He was a sudetendeutche (ph), which means he came from Czechoslovakia. He spoke Czechoslovakian, Czech, so we could understand. He could understand Polish, and he had the green uniform, and he was - he had a very foul language. He talked so badly, but he had - he was the only one that had a heart, the only one, because he never - he would always screamed at the people, screamed at and swore at them, even at me, like he called me all kinds of name, but I didn\u2122t pay attention because I knew that he had a heart. He neve r touched a Jew, although he had this rubber stick. He would pick it up and he would scream, \ufb01Get the hell out of here.\ufb02 And he was screaming, but he never - to such a degree that once he told the Ukrainians, \ufb01No one touches my Jews. Only I have the right to touc h my Jews.\ufb02 So, he wasn\u2122t so bad, and as a matter of fact, he was there for a long tim e. I don\u2122t know why he was later let go. He 32 went to Ostrowiec, which was a camp not far from us, and they tell me that he was horrible there. So, I don\u2122t know. He was the only German that I could say a good word about because the others were all murderer s and, I mean, I\u2122ll tell you stories unbelievable stories. Then we had - then we had in camp, above Vaschek (ph), Vaschek (ph) was in camp all the time. Then there was a guy by th e name of Meyer (ph) who was overseeing all the camps, but he would only come for an hour. He would talk with Vaschek (ph). You know, they would walk and talk. He wasn\u2122t yet - I mean, he wasn\u2122t good, but he wasn\u2122t yet as bad as the top man was called Altov (ph). He was the most horrible killer that one, I mean, he was - he was killing Jews and when he arrived into the camp, he wanted everybody to freeze in the place where - if you walked you had to stand up. He jumped over fences. He killed from all kinds of situations, like he would sit down, he would jump, he would kill people that appeared on his way, and we will just make a note then at the office that is deceased. He was th e worst of them, and apparently I heard that he was from a family because there was as I said called Altov (ph), apparently in Germany a very famous circus. So, he must have been an acrobat, because the way he behaved, I mean, only an acrobat could kill pe ople from all positions like him. Everybody was so scared of him that I didn\u2122t even look in his - I don\u2122t even - I don\u2122t remember his face because when he came to the office and asked for Vaschek (ph), I would pretend that - I was afraid to look up. So, that was the worst. Then, in the factories we had - we had people. Okay."

Whether this was the same Mrs. Altov (ph), but if must have been because I talked personally with her. When I heard that she was an Altov (ph), I went and I talked to her. And the way she described him, it must have been her son, and she says she was a gypsy and they were in the circus business. So, I can\u2122t tell you, but he wasn\u2122t an SS man. Everybody was afraid of him. The Judenrat was afraid of him. They were hardly talking to him, and I\u2122m telling you, I mean I would freeze. I put my eyes down, I so was afraid, and I kept my shoulders up because I was afraid that he would shoot me in a minute."

I only think like that because on two occasions, I was sent to the factory during selection, and the first time I thought I was lucky, but the second time, I thought maybe Vaschek (ph) did that.

They had the store, like in Wierzbnik; they had the store materials, sewing materials. He wasn\u2122t that pleasant, but he was good at giving orders and stuff like that. He wasn\u2122t as pleasant, as matter of fact, he was a little mean, but he was good if people refused to do things, you know, that they sent.

They gave me all - they treated me as if I was - as if I wasn\u2122t Jewish. And I remember, one of them, his bo ss went home, so he asked - my boyfriend asked him at the time to buy me a raincoat. He bought me the most b eautiful raincoat - of course, my boyfriend paid for it. And then Busko was liquidated before Starachowice, and they send them all to Treblinka, the whole family. He was the only one who survived Treblinka and broke out of Treblinka. How? Because when he came, they were looking for truck drivers. So, since he was a chauffeur for the Germans, he had very good credentials. So, they picked, they took him. So, I heard the story from somebody else, because I never saw him again. I\u2122ll tell you later, but they said he was a truck driver. Whatever he was doing, he was going outside with the Germans. Apparently - he was driving - apparently, at one time - he was a strong and tall man - apparently, he killed a German that he was driving and he ran awa y. And, when he ran away, he went back to Busko because they were quite wealthy people. They had all those hotels at the time. So, he figured that when he goes to his friend, hi s boss that he will help him - he will help him. Meanwhile - and I\u2122ll tell you how I found ou t about that, too - so, he went to Busko and he registered with his boss. He told him how he ran away. He mo st likely didn\u2122t tell him that he killed a German, and - and the guy said to him that he should show him where the family wealth is. They had mone y, like gold and rings and jewelry, and hidden somewhere on the property.

            "question": "Were you the first of the three?",
            "answer": "I was one of the first ones. I don\u2122t remember. Renia says that one of them recovered before I, but I - I don\u2122t remember whether Reni a or Krysia told me that I was really very sick, that I had a very high temperature and I was talking nonsense. I was delirious. But 49 once, when you were sick, like when you had typhus - first of all, when you had this high fever, this very high fever, you burned like anything, and even if you were delirious and you were contagious, you weren\u2122t as sick as during the crisis - when the crisis came, when your temperature went right down, you couldn\u2122t move, and this was - if you survived the crisis, you lived. Otherwise - and then you, after a while, you were yourself, but a lot of people didn\u2122t survive the crisis, and that was the time that I want to tell you about Sulamite (ph). Because that was when typhus was so rampant, everybody was sick. The Germans decided they\u2122d have to kill off the people that are sick. So, what they did, the decided, the army came in. It was as they - it wasn\u2122t - it wasn\u2122t because they needed soldiers to put all the sick ones on the truck to take them out. So, what they did, they told the policemen that everybody had to come out of the barracks, whether he was sick or healthy, and the Germans were watching them and asked them to run. Whoever could run - the sick ones with the fever could run - but the ones that were just going through the crisis, they couldn\u2122t. So, those were put on the truck, and they called me from the office to write down the names of the people that we re going on the trucks. Also, at that time, every policeman was - every policeman was responsible for a group, for a few barracks or one barrack, I forget how it was, but the policemen were responsible that everyone that was in the barrack came out. So, at that ti me, I remember, my sister-in-law, like my husband\u2122s sister\u2122s husband was also a policeman, he hid somebody there and covered because they person couldn\u2122t walk. So, later after what happened when they found the sick one there covered, you know, and very sick, they killed the policeman. Cogord (ph) was killed right on the spot. Then, as I was writing the names - I had two very good friends from Lodz, two very intelligent, beautiful, two tall girls - I forgot whether they were twins, but they were always together. One\u2122s name was Sulamite (ph), and the other Mira (ph). One went through quickly, like she ran through, and this Sulamite (ph) couldn\u2122t run, she just - because the reason for it was she was in crisis, and she runned, he sent her to, for me to write her name down. S o, I thought that they will take her to the truck. So, I asked - I didn\u2122t know those people because they came especially for that function. They were Becker\u2122s people. You know, Becker was outside the Lagers. Sicherheit Polizei or whatever you call it - Sicherheit Deist , I think they were called. So, those people were assigned this function. So, I said to the guy that was standing near me, \ufb01Please leave her. She\u2122s my best friend.\ufb02 So, he says, \ufb01Oh, she is, eh?\ufb02 He took out the gun and killed her right in my presence. So, I remember that - I didn \u2122t remember - I don\u2122t remember what happened to me because I fain ted, but the policemen later told me they got me quickly off my job, put me in the police barracks, covered me there, and the policeman was writing down the names after late r. So, that was very traumatic to me because I saw it with my own eye. I mean, it wa sn\u2122t her fault. She was sick, and all I did, I felt - I felt guilty because I told him she wa s my friend, but I thought that if I would tell him that she was friend, that he would sp are her life, but he just killed her."

So, he was dragging - not dragging, running with him, wherever they told him to take him, and you know all this sand was - how should I sa y - covering the face of this Jewish man. So, I saw a few people that were killed and by Atlov (ph), I mean, you know, nobody looked, but when he came and he always killed a few people."

So, Tobah (ph) - one day Becker, who was the Sicherheit Deist , came in a car with another German soldiers and they came and asked for Tobah (ph), and they took her out of the camp. We di dn\u2122t know why. Then, she came back. We didn\u2122t know why. Then, a few days later, he came for Tobah ( ph) again. Took her himself already. He took her out again. He was very polite. I remember because I was near the office, like they brought her to the office, and you know, I could look through the window and see. He opened the door for her, like if she was - like a girl, and he took her out and he brought her back the same day. The third time, he took her out - I don\u2122t know if it was a few days or a week or two later - he took her out and he never brought her back. Now, that day, he was ordered - her father was ordered to, to dig a grave, and of course, it was like, they called him to work. He didn\u2122t know it was going to be for him. So, he started digging but he was an older man. It took him a little time. So, Schrodt came out of his office, and he 55 took the gun and killed him on the spot. The grave wasn\u2122t dug exactly - like, the grave was half-finished and he called other workers to cover him. And she never came back. Then we found out, because they were from Opatow - it was about, I would say, about 40 kilometers away from Wierzbnik. Apparentl y, they had money - money or some goods or some jewelry. I don\u2122t know. She must have showed it to them, and after they got whatever they wanted, you know, the money, th ey just killed her. I didn\u2122t know what happened to her because they didn\u2122t bring her to camp, but I was talking to the professor about her because he had - he had her - heard the story and his records. He told me that he asked, whether he asked himself or whether one of those people that he - that he was talking to told him that she was - the grav e was found later in the woods very close to where she lived - where they lived, where they found the treasures. So, this was Tobjah Weisblum (ph) that\u2122s how she perished, and her father, for money. Not only because they were Jews, but because they had money."

So, if they met together it must have been during the day sometime, so the barrack was open for everybody to see. It wasn\u2122t that they had separate rooms or anything, because we had - it was like a cot undernea th and another one above.

But you know people, I think that peop le behaved a little better in camps. What I meant - I mean, there was nowhere to go, you had to do it - if you wanted to do it, everybody could watch. I don\u2122t know how many people got into a barrack. I was asked the same question by the historian.

All the policemen knew a bout it, because they were young and strong 58 people, and some people, but you know, some people that belonged to the group or was told about it, but not everybody knew about the pr eparations or the intentions because we were afraid that we could be denounced and killed. So, anyway, we decided - everything was secret - and we decided that Adrian was the best one to acquire - he volunteered because he was very good at schmoozing and ta lking people into it. So, we decided he\u2122s going to buy guns. We would collect whatever we can from the Ukrainians because when they were going home, they had to give th eir guns away and they went to get the guns when they came back to work. They didn\u2122t keep the guns with them. So, when they - that they were supposed to steal - the first gun was purchased, and my husband had it. He was the one to purchase this gun."

            "num": 295,
            "question": "No, where did it get it from?",
            "answer": "From a Ukrainian, a guard, bought it. They pa id for it through the nose with the collected, whatever we could collect. And he talked to one Ukrainian, and this Ukrainian agreed that he would be selling guns for such and such a price. I don\u2122t remember what it was, whether it was in gold or whether it was in money or whether it was in other things. When I say other things, some people were, in Wi erzbnik, like if we left a lot of things - valuables - not only gold and silver, but other valuables like blankets and furniture and all this. So, you know, we could tell the Ukrainian go to such and such, and we have the, let\u2122s say, two watches or something. Take the two watches and bring me a gun. I don\u2122t remember exactly how he got the first gun because that\u2122s as far as he got, the first gun. On the second try, they caught the Ukrainian, when he was stealing. Instead of taking one gun with him or whatever, they caught him stealing - they found two guns in his possession when he - whatever. So, of course, they investigated and they interrogated him and he said, \ufb01He doesn\u2122t know the name, but there is one of the policemen.\ufb02 So, they lined up the policemen, all twelve of them, a nd the Ukrainian came in and of course he sold it to Adrian, so he went there and he showed, \ufb01This is the policeman that bought from me the gun.\ufb02 Right away, Becker came in and he started interrogating my husband, and my husband said, Adrian, he says, \ufb01I never bought from him a gun. I don\u2122t know him. I didn\u2122t - I never saw him.\ufb02 But, of course, they didn\u2122t believe him. He was interrogated and we had such a bunker, a sma ll bunker that was made out of concrete. They put him there for a while, and then Judenrat went to Becker, and Becker came in and he said that he is lying, that Adrian is lying, because the Ukrainian didn\u2122t have any problems finding him, and he\u2122s going to be c ondemned to death. So, the Judenrat decided that - Becker you can buy him. This is the guy who took out _____, so, he says, \ufb01Okay, if you give me\u2013\ufb02 No, the Jew said, the Judenr at said to him, \ufb01How do you know? Maybe he\u2122s lying. Why not put him somewhere like lock him up until we find out, until the investigation is through. If this is true what happened, then he should be killed, but how you can take an innocent man? I mean the Ukrainian, maybe he had another reason why 59 he showed that this is the guy that bought from him the gun.\ufb02 So, they agreed. They put him in this bunker, and he had to dig his ow n grave, and Becker, not Becker, the other, the Baumgarten read, he read, you know, he read to him the order, that because he bought the gun from the Ukrainian and because he is key of an uprising, he\u2122s condemned to death. He said it in the name of Adolf Hitler, and whatever it is, and so he read this to him, and this was the first time that a grave was dug up and they had no body, because they kept him there and then when he got his money, they wanted a kilo of gold. A kilo of gold, but we didn\u2122t have gold, so everybody, if they hid some ring or whatever, even teeth they were putting in their head, and wh at happened, they went to Becker and this Baumgarten to say, \ufb01Now, you can start the investigation.\ufb02 So, in order for him not to be able to escape, they took him out of the bunker, took two Ukrainians, they covered his head - like, they put him on a bench, took o ff his clothes, put a sack, you know, like a sack hat you put potatoes in or sugar or whatever with holes in it? They put it over the head. They took two rubber sticks or whatever and they had such whips - whatever you call it - and they told him that he would get now a hundred whips and he has to count. So, you know, one, two, three\u2013 Adrian said after the twentieth whip, his body was numb. He says he couldn\u2122t even feel anything. He didn\u2122t care. So, anyway, after they did that, they put him back into the police barrack there, because they figured that after his body was black and blue and red and bloody. But he was a very strong boy, and don\u2122t forget that in 1943 he was nineteen. So, I mean, he was a young, strong boy. They put him in the barrack and they said, \ufb01This is only so that he can\u2122t escape or can\u2122t do anything.\ufb02 So, they took him from the bunker because he couldn\u2122t breathe there, and they put him in the barrack, and the next day they called in appel. Everybody had to go to the - everybody had to an appel so that they could tell them that what happens if - everybody will be shot who will take part, that if th ings like this, if people want to escape, if anybody escapes they will kill ten people for each one that escapes, and in addition, they are not going to - because somebody - they didn\u2122t say it anymore that Adrian bought the gun - somebody bought the gun for a certain purpose. They didn\u2122t know about the gun that already existed. They were talking about the gun that they caught the Ukrainian with, you know? There must be a reason why they wanted the gun, and while they were doing it, the guys that were thinking of escaping, of the uprising, they decided that when they visited Adrian later, when he was so sick, that they had to escape at the first opportunity. So, when everybody was standing at the appel and they were saying that, the policemen were moving because they were always helping to round up people. So, they went to Adrian\u2122s room. They took him out. They had some shears, and they decided, because the Ukrainians were also watching us inside - not outside, the only Ukrainian that was okay was kept, was on the gate. But they decided to cut - there was ten of them, ten young people. I don\u2122t know how many policemen, but I think about two or three policemen. The rest were young boys that were always in contact to do the uprising. So, while they were talking and we were watched by the Ukrainians and the policemen moving around, they cut the barbed wire and my husband, like Adrian was at the time, you can imagine, after he got those lashes the night before or the day before. They jumped over the fence and started running. They had to run quickly over the road because on the other side of the road there were forests and the Germans usuall y, like, all they wanted is to get to the 60 forest as fast as they could. But meanwhile Schrodt, the guy that was watching, he started shooting. So, immediately they took all the Uk rainians and Schrodt was in charge. He had a motorcycle and he started running after them. But until they found they were a little bit further. So, anyway they managed to go to the forest and the Ukrainians and Schrodt came back and Schrodt said to Vaschek (ph), like they said, \ufb01I am telling you, the young Wilczek (ph) ________,\ufb02 which in German means the younger Wilczek (ph) I killed personally. So, we all thought that he\u2122s dead, like his mother and his sister assumed that he\u2122s completely dead. Meanwhile , the ten of them managed to go to the forest, and what are they going to do? I mean, they run away the way they were. Nothing - they had nothing on them. They had no guns, no knives, I mean, I don\u2122t know why Adrian didn\u2122t take his gun. I never asked him that question, bu t when they reached the forest, they were very happy. And we had three kinds of partisans in the forest. One - I\u2122ll name them by the Polish name, and then I\u2122ll try to translate. One was Armia Rudowa (ph), which means the People\u2122s Army. This was run by the Russians. It was a Communist party under Russian supervision, and they were taking everybody, like not everybody. They were accepting people that when they needed them. The second group was called Armia Kryowa (ph), which means the home army. Those were Po lacks, those were Polish people. They wouldn\u2122t accept Jews, but they would accept Po lish people. They didn\u2122t kill the Jews. They hated them, but they didn\u2122t kill them. But then there was an Innoset (ph) which was a partisan group that were like Nazi, National Polish Organization that they were killing the Jews like if they met them - the real anti-Semites. So, anyway, they were sitting there. I remember four names - three names - four names. I remember four names of the escapees. I don\u2122t remember th e rest. So, it was Adrian. It was a guy Salik Anulevicz (ph), he was the real first cousin of Daniel Levicz (ph) from Warsaw ghe tto. And, the third one was Freumik Singer (ph), he was from Opatow - he was related to Tobjah Weisblum (ph), and the fourth one was James Levy (ph) , he was also a policeman, and there were six others, but I really don\u2122t remember their names now. So, as they were waiting in the forest, the Russian group came by. So, they told them that they are from camp escapees and so on. So the guys said, \ufb01I can\u2122t take ten. We can\u2122t take ten. We don\u2122t have room for ten. We don\u2122t have arms for ten.\ufb02 Because the supplies came dire ctly from Russia by plane. So, they couldn\u2122t take so many. So, he says, \ufb01We can only take two of you.\ufb02 So, he picked up this Freumik (ph) from Opatow a nd they picked Adrian. And, he says, \ufb01And you stay here, maybe the next group will take you because we don\u2122t have room.\ufb02 There was apparently 25 of them in this group, this Russian group. So, there were 27 of them. Then - so, I will now speak about them, and I\u2122 ll come back later to those. I\u2122ll say what happened to them later. So, anyway they star ted to - they needed miner. What I mean miners - the ones who will put mines under brid ges so that the German arms couldn\u2122t put them in trains like - what they had to do, th ey had to put mines under the bridges, but the mines were not like today\u2122s sophisticated. They had their mine. They had the string. They had to first go by boat, don\u2122t forget the Germans were watching. They were over every bridge, there were German soldiers walking back and forth because that\u2122s what they were afraid of, that the bridges would be mined. So, they had to swim or go by such a boat that couldn\u2122t hear anything under the bridge, put the mine there, go far enough with the string, wait until the train comes - goes by, and pull it. It was a very dangerous job, and very 61 specialized because when the Germans were up there, if they heard anybody in the river, they were shooting them right away. So, that was a very - the two Jewish boys that were accepted, Freumik (ph) and Adrian, they were doing those jobs, and now, they had different encounters with the Germans looki ng for them, but the Germans were always afraid to go straight to the forest. They had people that were in the village, Polish villages that were telling them about the movement of the Germans and where they were going, and whether they were coming, what happened he re and there. So, they had contact with the world. They had enough to eat there. I m ean, not that they were given special - like Adrian says, they would bring them a gl op of pork, you know, the fat, and they would just eat half a pound to a pound of it, no bread or anything because it depends on what they had and brought in, and he says, \ufb01You wouldn\u2122t believe what I could eat - this pure fat.\ufb02 And, they could really eat the pound of fat without anything. So, they weren\u2122t really hungry. They slept in the woods, and they were doing the mine work. That was their work."

Anyway, one day, he got so sick, he got delirious, so they said they had to move for whatever reason, and they told him that they can\u2122t take him because he couldn\u2122t walk. So, he asked them to kill him. He said, \ufb01Maybe if you kill me because I...\ufb02 But they couldn\u2122t kill him. So, they gave him, like, they gave him a gun. They covered him up. They gave him all the food they had, and they left him there. They kissed him and they said, \ufb01We are very sorry,\ufb02 because they left him ther e to die because he was so sick. So some people were going by the woods and they found him and they took him - some Polacks, most of them were collaborating with the partisans. They were the people that were saying where the Germans are. So, they took h im home and they, and it took him ten days and he was better. So, he decided to go back to his group.

The 62 Germans came in while they were asleep in there, and\u2013and one of the - where they kept horses or cows or whatever - one of those buildings, they put it afire and everybody got killed. So, he felt so bad, but, I mean, he c ouldn\u2122t believe it. So, he went\u2013he went back to the woods, after he felt better, and he decided he\u2122ll wait for another group.

We didn\u2122t know that there was an Auschwitz, but it was enough that any German can - could come and kill anybody and, I mean, how did we know? Maybe one day all of them woul d just, keep shooting until they shoot us all. So, those ten that ran away, they were from this group, and they had the best opportunity because the guards weren\u2122t there - only one guard.

Like, when he had this string, he had to go far enough so that nothing would happen to him. He had to - he - he activated the mine, the bridge went up in flam es or whatever it was, whatever, and he had to run away back to the forest.

Don\u2122t forget that the war in Poland - in Poland, in the woods there or in this district already finished around January of 1945. So, that was shortly before - before the end of the war. Because we were - for us, May was the end of the war, but for him, where he 66 was in Poland, the Russians were very close. So, January was already the end of the war. So, anyway, when he came back to the woods, the worst of the groups, Anazed (ph), got him. So, the - the name of - the name of the captain or wh atever, whatever he was, I know one of the leaders of this group was - his name was Orlig (ph), which means - how do you call it now? The bird that has such a big beak, such a very aristocratic bird."

            "question": "Tern?",
            "answer": "No, aristocratic. I forgot now. Anyway, it was a bird, like he said - Adrian told him the truth because there was no use to tell him that - that he\u2122s Polish or whatever. So, the guy looked at him and he figured like this - it\u2122s almost the end of the war, what they did now, the Germans would go away because they were sometimes even they were more against Russians than the Germans. They were against Germans, too, but if they have to choose, they would kill the Russians. So, he figured lik e in his mind was that if he keeps a Jew, he\u2122ll have a token no matter what happens. He had a son who befriended Adrian very much - was a friend. So, he told him, \ufb01Please don\u2122t tell the guys in the group that you are Jewish.\ufb02 And, he went and he taught him to pr ay the Catholic prayer, and he made - he was the one that started the prayer and then - but, Adrian was quite honest. So, he told his son, but the son never told on him. Adrian di dn\u2122t realize that he wanted to - that he wanted to - the guy, the captain of the group wanted to save his life by holding a Jew, but he didn\u2122t tell anybody else, but he figured when the Russians come, you prove to them that he\u2122s a saint because he has a Jew there. So, anyway, soon after the war finished - and he was working with them in the woods there - and soon the war finished, the Russians started appearing. And right away, this guy wanted to say that - that he saved a Jew, but Adrian didn\u2122t pay attention to it, but the Russian - the wors t part was that the Russian, when he saw him, he said, \ufb01Tell me your st ory.\ufb02 So, Adrian tells him the story, and he says he was in the People\u2122s Army. They were all Russians, mostly Russians and there were two of them - he didn\u2122t say Jewish becau se he says that they escaped the camp, and they were accepted there, and he says, \ufb01This is the last group.\ufb02 He didn\u2122t say anything about being Jewish or anything because he didn\u2122t know who the Russian is. So, the Russian says to him in Russian, he says, \ufb01Y ou know, this is a very interesting story. There was 27 of you - 27 of you -25 Russians and two Polacks,\ufb02 and he says, \ufb01That\u2122s interesting that one Polack got out and all the Russians, you know, all the Russians perished.\ufb02 So, Adrian said, he says to his guy, \ufb01Kill him, like, shoot him - shoot him.\ufb02 So, he says, \ufb01What do you want? I\u2122m Jewish.\ufb02 S o, the guy says in Jewish to him, \ufb01Why didn\u2122t you tell me that befor e?\ufb02 So, anyway, he was saved, but now this guy from the Anazed that killed so many Jews on his ways, trie d to - since Adrian was already there, like the Russian and him were already such frie nds, and so, he tried to say that he was also good to the Jews because he saved him, but he wasn\u2122t. So, Adrian says, \ufb01I am the first Jew that he saved.\ufb02 Because he told hi m, when he accepted him, \ufb01You are the first Jew that I met in my life that I\u2122ll save you - that I\u2122m going to save your life.\ufb02 So, he repeated it. I mean, he just said it. I don\u2122t know what happened to them. I don\u2122t think that anything happened to them. Adrian was right aw ay made, like, he was a lieutenant right away. They put all the stars on him, and then when he came home, he worked for the - 67 like, he was - he worked in the army as a li eutenant. Now, I\u2122ll go back to Salik Anulevicz (ph) and the others. When this - when they took the two of them - the two of them - the two guys Freumik (ph) and Adrian, they were very much concerned what happened to the other guys, but they never found out. Only after the war, they found out what happened. Salik started his story. When they took them and went away, there was eight of them left. So, Armia Kryowa, which was the home army, which wa sn\u2122t killing the Jews, but they were - they were doing everything possible to make their life miserable, went by and they see eight people, and the people - they all told them what happened. They told them, \ufb01We run away from this Jewish camp in\u2013\ufb02 And not all of them spoke because the - Hassidic Jews that spoke Yiddish at home, they had a very big accent. You could right away notice that they were not - I mean, you couldn\u2122t tell them you are Polish. They all knew that they were Jewish. So, they said, they, so, there was eight of them - they - they were antiSemitic, but they said, \ufb01We are not going to kill you, but what we are going to do\u2013\ufb02 They told them to undress. They left them eight people naked, the way they are. They took their clothes away. He says, \ufb01Now, wait for the Russians to come, for the other army - for the People\u2122s Army. They\u2122ll take you.\ufb02 Bu t, and they laughed and laughed that they left them alive but completely naked and took away their clothes. So, they were there and they started thinking, \ufb01What are we going to do now?\ufb02 I mean, they can\u2122t move. They have nothing. They have no clothes. So, they sat and Salik Anulevicz (ph) was the only one that spoke without an accent. So, they said, \ufb01You know what?\ufb02 There\u2122s a forest - there was a farmhouse and the guy was looking af ter the forests, you know. So, he says, \ufb01There is this house. If you can go there and bring us clothes or food or something.\ufb02 So, he says, \ufb01Why me? Why not you?\ufb02 He says, \ufb01You can speak Polish.\ufb02 So - so, he went. He decided - I mean, he had no alternative. He went there, and on the way, a woman came out of the house, and he told her th e story. It was a young woman. It was the daughter of the - this forestman. So, she took him home. She gave him something to wear and food and the father came in and the father says, \ufb01I can\u2122t take eight people. I cannot.\ufb02 \ufb01Okay, we can take food and clothes and whatever we can.\ufb02 But he says, \ufb01They will kill me, the Germans, if they know that I hide so many Jews.\ufb02 Anyway, apparently the girl fell in love with this Salik Anulevicz (ph) a nd she decided to save him, and she took him in and she was hiding him there, and he surviv ed the war in her place. Now, I\u2122ll go back to the seven and I\u2122ll tell you what happened to Salik Anulevicz (ph). So, he and the daughter - this daughter and her name was Hela (ph), because he always talked about her, Salik Analewicz, after the war. So, the girl\u2122s name was Hela (ph). He and Hela (ph) were going - went to give them food and give them clothes, but they under no circumstances can they keep them there because there was eight of them. So, they were helping them with - nobody knows what happened to them. Nobody - they didn\u2122t survive the war. How did they perish in the woods because when one day they were there, they weren\u2122t there. Like, you know, they were taking daily food to them and water, but they weren\u2122t there. Nobody knows whether they perished and they must have perished because nobody came back. Now, I\u2122ll go back to this Salik Anulevicz (ph). He lived there with this woman and she promised - he promised that he would marry her. He promised he will marry her after the war, but after the war he changed his mind, but he - he wanted to pay them back for what they did for him. So, he was a very rich guy - I forgot which city he lived, but he 68 was not far from the Czechoslovakian border th ere. They had some real estate and stuff like that. He went to the lawyer and assigned all the real estate to her, and he says whenever, as long as he lives, if he can help her in any way, he will help her. I don\u2122t know whether he could do it, whether she cashed in on his promises, whether she could get - although he went to a lawyer and signed over all this properties to her, we don\u2122t know because he never - no, he saw her once. Her father was - her father was accused of being, not a Nazi, but that he collaborated with the Germans, and they took him out, put him to jail, and she new where Salik was in Po land at the time yet. So, she says, \ufb01I want you to be a witness to telling him that we - that we saved you.\ufb02 So, he went there and they let the father go. Whether he was a German collaborator or not, I don\u2122t know. Anyway, Salik Anulevicz (ph) went to West Europe, and th en he went to Brazil. He married a Swiss girl, and he was coming to To ronto every year because he had - he died five years ago. He died before my husband because the two of them were friends like, you know, and not only that, he had a brother Hirsa (ph). He was coming and he always went, like he stayed with us with his wife and whenever we talked to them, he was talking about this Hela. He wanted to go to Poland to see Hela, and the wife was willing to go with him, but she says, \ufb01You only know her first name, that Hela. She must have - since then she must have been married. She must have moved out of this farmhouse. How are we going to find her?\ufb02 He wanted to see Hela who saved his life. All his life, he was talking about her. He died, as I said, about five years ago. We never heard of the eight - no, the seven other guys, and Freun (ph) was killed together with the - with like, by the Germans together with the whole group. So, this is Adrian\u2122s story."

So, maybe she didn\u2122t get it. He wanted to - and his ways, he was okay, but in his ways, he was also simple like he didn\u2122t know how to go about it.

And when I say a lot, I don\u2122t know how many, but I would say maybe a hundred people got killed by the Germans, because th ey started shooting, the Ukrainians and the Germans, everybody, because they were much more ready to combat all those people after the escape than before, because before it never happened, and - and those - I\u2122m sure that Chris and Renia must have told you th e story, how those people were moaning. They were lying there. They didn\u2122t kill them, and they - they were crying and shouting and screaming, all those people, because they trie d to escape.

I mean, where can you take Renia? I\u2122m telling you, she was a sickly - always sick, always, every Tuesday and Thursday like this - it\u2122s a Jewish expression - she had either a cold or she was sneezing. She was always sick.

He took it and he says, \ufb01Thank you very much,\ufb02 and he went, and I didn\u2122t s ee him anymore. Then, came a time for us to go to like - the train came over, and they were putting people, a hundred people - a minimum of a hundred people in each cattle wagon, a minimum of a hundred, because I know that in some places there were 125 people instead of I don\u2122t know how many horses they put in a wagon. The train was a small train, and it had two little windows with bars, and they were closing the doors by sliding one door, so I don\u2122t know how many horses, maybe four or five horses. But we were in the last, like, there were mostly men\u2122s - men\u2122s trains first and then th ey were ladies\u2122 friends - or trains, ladies\u2122 trains. So, we happened to go, Renia and Chris and I, happened to go in the last train. They pushed us in. So, and the train moved and we knew a nd we heard crying because people were fighting with each other. They could only sta nd. In our wagon - in our train, we could sit down. We couldn\u2122t lie down, but we could sit down and, you know, when the people are like that, and they were hungry and thirsty and they were fighting with each other so we heard moans and stuff like that, and the trai n was very, very slow. So, when the train moved and this Feld Polizei, they were sitting on the roofs, you know, they had - they were sitting on the roofs of the train. They all went with us, as if we were the most dangerous criminals. They would because they - they were with guns. Anyway, as we were going, it was time for us to get some wate r because at a certain station, they stopped the train to get pails of water and to just put the pails of water for the people to have water, like Renia and Chris - not Renia and Krysia, but people - and I tell, the people 79 says, \ufb01We didn\u2122t get any water.\ufb02 But anyw ay, this one guy, this guy, this French guy came in and says, \ufb01The girl that speaks Frenc h.\ufb02 I didn\u2122t even get up. I forgot that I speak French, because I only spoke with him once. So, he says, \ufb01The girl that speaks French.\ufb02 So, I came to this little window and he says, \ufb01Take a couple of other girls because we are going for water. To bring water for them.\ufb02 S o, he had some pails. So, I called - I thought that I took Krysia and Renia, but Krysia went with me, but Renia says she doesn\u2122t remember. So, I maybe I took - like, I asked a nother girl, but Krysia definitely was with me. So, we went for to bring the water. Ev eryone was getting either one pail or two, I don\u2122t remember. Anyway, when we came to the well where the water was to be, you know, like we pumped the water, he says in French to me, \ufb01I am going to let you runaway now. You just run when you want. Don\u2122t worry, I\u2122m going to shoot later. First, I will pretend that I didn\u2122t notice.\ufb02 He said it in French. \ufb01I pretend that I didn\u2122t notice. I don\u2122t want you here, run!\ufb02 So, I looked at him, and I thought to myself, \ufb01He\u2122s crazy. He\u2122s going to - we will run and he will kill us.\ufb02 S o, I said to Chris in Polish, \ufb01He wants us to run, but I\u2122m not going to run. I don\u2122t trust hi m.\ufb02 And he said again, \ufb01Run, and I\u2122m going to shoot. Don\u2122t worry, just run.\ufb02 Where ar e we going to run? We are somewhere all strange. We didn\u2122t know where to go. So, I said to Krysia, \ufb01I\u2122m not going. I\u2122m going back. My father is there,\ufb02 and I thought Renia was with us, but I asked her. So, maybe Renia was there, so we didn\u2122t want to go. And so we went back. He says, \ufb01I warned you.\ufb02 And then he says, \ufb01Okay, if you don\u2122t want to run away now,\ufb02 because I said to him, \ufb01I don\u2122t have where to run.\ufb02 So, he says, \ufb01If you don\u2122t , but don\u2122t write it down, just remember, what I\u2122m going to tell you know. Ju st remember. My name is Leo Bernard. My address is Merignan Mine (ph). Don\u2122t write it down anywhere, but if you ever have a chance or any of you have a chance. If you rememb er to tell them to come, I\u2122ll say - you could stay whatever.\ufb02 Like, we would have an address where to run away."

Did he say the truth? But, he really and truly told us to run."

The train didn\u2122t go on a regular route. They trains were going on side roads and they were very slow, very slow, and they stopped from time to time for crossing, for different things, and I remember two nights when they closed the doors and then when they opened the door slightly for us to get a little bit of breeze, and as you know, on the way to Auschwitz, a lot of people perished. Some were trampled by other people. As a matter of fact, my husband\u2122 s brother and father died in the - because there was so many people, 125 people, and they had to go to the bathroom and they had to do, you know, those things were not provided.

She was always cold. She was always sick. So, that was our worry, but we were very lucky that we kept together.

            "answer": "First of all, we had a very bad experien ce because the guards that took us before they took us to change our dresses and everything, we went very close by a crematorium, or if that wasn\u2122t a crematorium, we were told it was a crematorium. So, I remember having a bottle of whiskey that this Frenchman - I forgot to tell you that the Frenchman left in Auschwitz, he says, \ufb01If they take you to the crematorium...\ufb02 So, we had this bottle of whiskey. I never drank in my life, but all the gi rls - I told the girls, so when they German soldiers stopped us in front of the crematoriu m, or he called this crematorium, so we took this bottle and every girl had a taste. Not a taste of it, but you know, like we were thinking that we\u2122re going to die now so let\u2122s just be merry. We never drank in our lifetimes, but the whole bottle went. Like, as far as it went from us, and then they took us to the place where they cut our hair, and afte r that he stayed with us there for a few minutes to scare us or to whatever - to what ever, and then they took us to the place where we had to leave everything we had, to put on the uniform or whatever you call it, a dress 85 with stripes, and they cut our hair. This is another story how I suffered the most out of all of three of us. And, then we went to the barrack. So, I\u2122ll tell you maybe how they first brought us in and told us to take all our clothes off and they put nothing else, we had no brassiere, this I remember - because I was so - it felt so strange to just have the dress on - and they gave us the dress. The dress was too short on me, so there was a small girl that I don\u2122t know who, we changed dresses to fit us. Because we were all very skinny, but nobody was as tall as I. They were mostly sma ller people. So, there were just a few long dresses. I was glad that somebody exchanged wi th me the dress. Then, they cut our hair to here. They checked our hair for lice. They put this stuff in, disinfectant or whatever you call it, in our hair and on our bodies before they gave us the dresses, and I remember, they took away my shoes. So, they gave us such wooden shoes - wooden shoes - and this was a case where the wooden shoes - we were already in dresses and men from another camp were distributing the shoes, and the guy sa ys, \ufb01Take it, take it.\ufb02 To me like, in Polish we have - like in English you say \ufb01you\ufb02 it means everything, but do you understand French or German? So, they say \ufb01vous\ufb02 or \ufb01tu\ufb02 or in German they said - they say, because here you say \ufb01you\ufb02, in Polish also you never talk to a lady by calling her \ufb01Dou\ufb02(ph), you caller her \ufb01Vu\ufb02 like, and the guy says, \ufb01Take those, take those.\ufb02 Well I just said, \ufb01How dare you calling me \u201adou\u2122?\ufb02 Ok ay, it was so stupid. And, then so anyway I put those dresses - I couldn\u2122t walk in them, a nd then they put us five people in a row to march to the barracks. So, we were five, and so - Krysia, Renia and I were three and there was three others. They didn\u2122t want to part and we didn\u2122t want to part. So, this woman goes, she says, \ufb01What\u2122s the commotion? The couple there.\ufb02 You know, I just came to a new camp. I didn\u2122t like the way guy says to me \ufb01Dou,\ufb02 and here she screams at me. I wasn\u2122t really used to it because you know nobody really mistreated me when I worked before, and she says, \ufb01Go to the back.\ufb02 I sa y, \ufb01I\u2122m not going to the back.\ufb02 She says - I say, \ufb01Those are my two sisters.\ufb02 She didn\u2122t ev en want to hear. She took me by the hair, grabbed me by the hair, to the German man th ere that was cutting th e hair, and she says, \ufb01Make a cross on her head.\ufb02 So, you know, she was mad that I talked back to her. So, first he made the cross, and then he felt so rry for me and he shaved my head, but I was the only one with a really shaved head of hair. You know, like, I didn\u2122t have anything on my head - just - I don\u2122t know whether I looked like a boy or whatever. Anyway, finally we just didn\u2122t want to be parted and I didn\u2122t care what she says. She couldn\u2122t kill me, like I was daring. I said, \ufb01I\u2122m not going, they are my two sisters. I\u2122m going with them.\ufb02 So, she got mad. She pushed us. Anyway, we\u2122re toge ther. I didn\u2122t want to part from them, because if I went to the back or whatever, I mean, it wasn\u2122t the next row - we would have never been together. When we came to the barrack\u2013"

Everybody had had hair to here because, you know, when we went to - they wouldn\u2122t have touched us. This is my logic now - they wouldn\u2122t have touched us before they disinfected us. Don\u2122t forget when we were - when we went under the shower, we shed our clothes and we got whatever clothes to put on. We were already, like, we were already clean. It was after the wash. They sprayed such a horrible thing on us. It smelled horrible, and it was stinging us because it wa s against - I don\u2122t know against what - a disinfectant. So, I\u2122m positive that they woul dn\u2122t have touched our hair if we didn\u2122t go through disinfection before. That\u2122s my logic now; I don\u2122t remember the sequence."

            "answer": "Now I\u2122ll tell you the story. I, myself - okay, we came in. They gave us a barrack, three rows of bunks, bigger bunks than we had, but I would say six - five to six people slept. We had to sleep like sardines. One this way, one this way, one this way, because - and they were boards, just boards, because in camp in Starachowice, we had straw underneath. Here, you know, like it was a straw sack with straw inside. So, it wasn\u2122t so bad. This was on the bare thing and we - there wasn\u2122t enough room to sleep one way. We had to have the heads one way\u2013 But now I\u2122m going back, because when we arrived, there was a little window similar enough to the windows without bars , but similar to the window in the train that I told you, a small ju st to let some light in. So, I , you know, I\u2122m tall, so I stood there and I see - I see there\u2122s a man there, and I l ooked at - I looked, it was myself, but I didn\u2122t know. So, I say, \ufb01Man!\ufb02 I looked out this way. I don\u2122t see any man, but then I looked in the mirror, and there\u2122s a man there. So, I started moving my head. I realized that\u2122s me. I didn\u2122t recognize myself . I would never believe. I was very skinny at the time and very tall, and my head looke d like a pin drop, like with the hair, you know, my head was very small by comparison. Li ke, I couldn\u2122t recognize myself, and it was funny because one day I was walking the streets and, you know, the men was coming - were coming to do the toilets in the ladies\u2122 - the ladies didn\u2122t clean - it wasn\u2122t a toilet - how do you call it when there are only holes?"

            "question": "The latrine. 89",
            "answer": "The latrines. The men were coming to clean the latrine and one of our guys, a boy from Germany - I remember his name, Lothar - he was picked to clean the toilets. So, he came in and he saw me. He was so happy. He comes, he says, \ufb01Tell Hania that your father is alive.\ufb02 I looked at him and I was so vain, I didn\u2122t tell him for a minute that I was Hania, because I didn\u2122t want anybody to know that I looked like that. He didn\u2122t - I don\u2122t know - I don\u2122t know. I didn\u2122t ask him, but I came home and I said, \ufb01I\u2122m so glad he didn\u2122t recognize me.\ufb02 Like, people are stupid. I mea n, I\u2122m talking about myself. So, then we went into the barrack. The barrack wa s run by four people. There was the Lager \u00c4lteste, which was responsible for the barrack. There were two thousand people going in one barrack, you can imagine how ma ny people. So, there was the Lager \u00c4lteste. She was a Czechoslovakian girl. Her name wa s Yolichka (ph). Then there was a Shreiberin who had a job like I had. She kept records who went to work, and she was doing all the office work. Her name was Felicia Berlant (ph). She\u2122 s still alive. She save d our lives. She was the Shreiberin. Then there were two Steuben \u00c4lteste. The barrack was divided in four and each Steuben \u00c4lteste which was responsible for this part - for like two parts of the barrack on this side, and two parts of the barrack on that side. She kept, she kept, she made us clean the places where you slept. She ma de us responsible for, responsible for cleanliness, that\u2122s all, and order in the place s. When we arrived, this Yolichka (ph) spoke Czech to us, but we understood. This Fela Berl ant (ph), she got the job because she could scream the most and she had a language sim ilar to Vaschek (ph). So, when we arrived and we didn\u2122t stay straight she says, \ufb01You\u2013\ufb02 - I have to translate it because - \ufb01Quiet, you whores from Starachowice.\ufb02 She didn\u2122t call us any other - not that she was bad. She saved our lives and many other people . She was a good woman, but otherwise she wouldn\u2122t have had the job if she didn\u2122t speak like that. She called us names of all sorts. And when we arrived, and we got the job, we were working outside the camp, outside the camp, and we were cutting bulrushes in we tland. So, we stood always in cold water, wetland, cutting, and those - we had those knives that the Germans gave us at the place of work already, that we had to cut, but it was so woody, like it was so hard. It was the hardest job I ever had. My hands were bleed ing because the bulrushes when they grow for such a long time, they become woody, and to cut it with a knife it\u2122s very hard. He had - he had german shepherds, like he took us to work. We cut it. We were cutting those bushes, two german shepherds - like, I don\u2122 t know how many of the guards were there that took us, but two huge german shepherds and as a matter of fact, the first day he taught me a lesson. Of course, I was picked be cause I was tall again. So, he wanted to show us that if - because we were outside the camp and the reason why they were cutting those bushes because they wanted to clean up the barbed wire walls in order, if somebody wanted to run away and hide there or if there was a partisan attack or some attack, so they could hide in those bulrushes. So, we had to cut them. So, he wanted to show us what would happen to everybody - to anybody that intends to run away. So, he called his dog and he told him to - he told him to start b iting my dress, and he must have told him in German, because he didn\u2122t touch me. He just tear my dress to pieces, and of course, I froze because I am afraid of dogs, like especially touch, you know, the mean dogs that bark so, and the teeth were so bad, and he stopped at him at a certain time and started again. So, the dog didn\u2122t bite me, but he bit, like, my dress was in shreds. I got another 90 dress from Fela when I went back. But, that was a time when I was really scared, very scared, because I thought the dog was going to kill me. So, I just stood there, and so we worked there for three months. After three months\u2013"

So, I don\u2122t know how often I did that, I don\u2122t remember, but I think once a week or once every ten days. Wh en we arrived there, we undressed, they took our clothes, they put it through the same function, like they gave us - okay, what they had to do to put this stuff to disinfect all the dresses. So, they gave us - they took another bunch that they already disinfected from another group, and they gave it to us, and we had a new dress, but each time it was a new old dress. Each time, I had to fight to get the longest, but I was very lucky. Th e girls always cooperated with me because otherwise they would have to have a dress like this. So, that was the procedure. So, whenever we went there, German soldiers would come - like, we would be - I mean, this wasn\u2122t in the plan, but I think that was the character that they wanted to do it - they would come to the room where we were, and they would take a hose with cold water, put it on the highest tension, and they would just not only tease the girls, but they would come and they would just try to spray you with this - with all the force in your private parts. If you screamed or you danced, they did worse to you. So, we knew that we had to stand still. We had to disregard it. We had to say nothing, just stand there and pretend that it doesn\u2122t happen to you. So, that - so, we weren\u2122t looki ng forward to the showers so much because we had to suffer, and nobody - I\u2122m sure that it wasn\u2122t like, it wasn\u2122t meant to be like that, but they did it."

So, anyway, when we were there for three months working so hard, she tried to always give me a better dress, or you know, if she had something that was special, she would always give it to us and really treat us a little better then she treated everybody else. And then, one time, there was a Polish uprising in Warsaw, not Jewish, Polish uprising, and they caught all the people - Polish girls to - that they caught, that they thought that took part in this uprising, maybe men, too, but th ey came to Auschwitz, and they were Polish people, so they didn\u2122t go to crematorium and they didn\u2122t go to a barrack where they send them to hard labor, and what they did - wh atever they brought with them, the suitcases and everything, every piece of clothes had to be recorded, and when they - and they had red triangles - and when they finished their sentence, because they were not convicted for life or taken to camp like that, but when they finished the verdict fo r two months, half a year, a year, they were getting the clothes washed and ironed, and they went home. So, at that time, Jews never worked in this depa rtment, only Polish people, but because of the fact that Polish people were coming and they didn\u2122t want any problems, they needed 20 girls to go there, to write down the, you know, to sort out the clothes, to write down the clothes, to hang up the clothes, to wash the laundry and stuff like that. So, they decided to take 20 Jewish girls from our - from - and of course the Shreiberin got the order - the first two of us, she picked me and Krysia right away, and she had the 20 girls because we begged her to take - to give Renia. She\u2122s like, \ufb01I can\u2122t. This is office work. She looks - 94 she\u2122s too young. They want - they will never take her.\ufb02 So, we begged her and begged her. So, she went to Yolichka (ph) who was the Lager \u00c4lteste - the barrack \u00c4lteste , and she asked her. She said, \ufb01Well, all I can do is to ask the German.\ufb02 You know, the German guy that\u2122s going to pick them up if he agrees , but she says, \ufb01I can\u2122t take all of them, because they need 20 people.\ufb02 So, anyway we were so nervous, I remember, the German came in. Fela was there standing, and Yolichka (ph) went to the German soldier who was transporting us to the new job, and she said to him, \ufb01There\u2122s three sisters, the youngest is the best, but she looks a little bit small, but she isn\u2122t that young. She only looks young and she\u2122s the best of them all. She can organize\u2013\ufb02 I don\u2122t know what happened to the German. He said yes for Reina. She brought her in. She was the 21 st, that never happened before. I don\u2122t know whether it was pure luck or whether it was Fela who did that for us, or whether it was Yolichka (ph) that did it for us, or whether the German just felt sorry for whatever reason. We were transported to a new life. First of all, when we came there, this department wasn\u2122t for Jews. So, ever yone - although we slept, I don\u2122t know, ten in one room, but we had - we had cots for separa te, like, it was also three \ufb01floors\ufb02 I call it, but they were single. They were single, and they had sheets and everything, like no appels, can you imagine? No - I di dn\u2122t tell you a story about appels before. No appels of any kind because there was only 20 of us, and so me of the Polish girls, they left a few Polish girls to teach us how to do the work. Some of them, we found out after the war, they were Jewish but they were on Polish papers - some of them. With one, Krysia is in contact with one Polish girl she\u2122s in contact with lived - that worked there. That was the best job we could get. The Polish girls were coming. They gave us the stuff. In their presence, we wrote down everything they had. We put it in a sack. The sack was hanging there with their number. And, when they were going out, we had to wash and iron their stuff, but we - we weren\u2122t there long enough to wash and iron, but we were taught to do that. So, it was the best job. There was 21 girls that had - I mean, we weren\u2122t there too long because we went there maybe in November and in January we were transported somewhere else, but I didn\u2122t believe it\u2122s Auschw itz. It was the best job and I said now that we were so lucky, because can you imagine, there was so many of us, and we were lucky, the three of us, that we got this job in Auschwitz. I mean, it was the best possible because it wasn\u2122t meant for Jews. It just ha ppened that they needed - they didn\u2122t want Polish girls doing it."

I saw horses and people, maybe I had a bad - a bad vision there, but I couldn\u2122t have had, because I started so long I was working, always was working like this. So, I saw things that didn\u2122t exist. And, if my sisters wouldn\u2122t have kept me, I don\u2122t thi nk I would have survived. Maybe Renia had ____, or maybe I woke up a little and we carried Renia. That was the - then you saw so many dead people because the Germans were pu shing us to go west with their dogs, and whoever couldn\u2122t go, they would just shooting, like they couldn\u2122t - and, you saw those people. One person was sitting under a tree - was sitting there. He was dead, and you know, what the worst part was that the people that were walking were taking the shoes and the - when they saw a dead person, quickly they would get the jacket or whatever they could grab. Nobody worried about it - what shoes or whatever they could get quickly so the Germans wouldn\u2122t send the dogs after them, and they walked - we just disregarded all the - the dead people. But to me, the man that was sitting under the tree, he looked so real and so alive and he was dead. Maybe, he just sat down to die. Then, we came to Ravensbr\u00fcck, I don\u2122t know, three days later, two days later. I don\u2122t know exactly what date it was, and there was no room for us in the barracks, and it was freezing and it was snowing, so we had to stay outside - sleep outside. So, we slept in the snow together, like we just warmed each other from the bodies , you know, with our bodies, we just warmed each other, and slept in the snow. Then, in the morning, we didn\u2122t get anything to eat. So, we took this dirty snow - most of the times, we took the snow from trees or something - and we drank it and ate it. For three days, we had no meat - because they didn\u2122t have any 98 room. From every side the people were sent to Ravensbr\u00fcck. They didn\u2122t have - they didn\u2122t even register us. They didn\u2122t even write our names. So, after three days, they send us to a camp called Retzow, which was\u2013"

I thought that they didn\u2122t register us, only in Retzow. But I will tell you this story. Now, I get confused. I would have to ask them. When we stood in line to be registered, I think it was in Retzow, but I could be wrong, maybe they did register us and that was in Ravensbr\u00fcck. We decided, like I told my sisters that if the Germans - the Russians were 70 kilometers from Auschwitz, and sound away (ph) fire in Auschwitz, like before we were moved, we were taken on the death ma rch there to Ravensbr\u00fcck, we saw fire. And somebody told us that they are burning all the records. You know, and I believed it was true, because the Russians were so close, they didn\u2122t want to have the records. So, we said - I said to my sisters, \ufb01We can save our lives by pretending we are Polish.\ufb02 So, Chris had a boyfriend; his name was Kleinburg. Kleinburg is a small mountain, you know, that\u2122s what it means in German, like, if you tr anslate it. So, she translated it into Polish: mala gorska. I said, \ufb01That\u2122s too long. Who is going to...? Let\u2122s eliminate the \u201amala\u2122 and we\u2122ll have the \u201agorsky\u2122, \u201agorska\u2122.\ufb02 So, we had to remember, what was the mother\u2122s name. So, my mother\u2122s name was Pola Blum - Tannenblum, but they were called Blum. So, I said, in Polish, a blum is a flower, it\u2122s like fiatek, so Fiatekosky, because if it was fiatek, you couldn\u2122t say fiatek. What was your father\u2122s name? So, we said \ufb01Gorsky\ufb02 because our name was Gorsky, and the first name, his name was Isaac, so we said \ufb01Anje\ufb02 because Anje was such a typical peasant Polish name. So, we gave this name to them. Then if they asked us any other questions, we have to remember that we are Polish; we are never Jewish. And of course, when we registered, we got the re d, the red triangles. That means political prisoners, so, you know . And immediately, when we arrived, I met some people that I knew, and they didn\u2122t want to talk to me because they had the yellow - we call it winkle (ph) - yellow triangle and we had the red one, and they didn\u2122t want to cause any problems for us that are Jewish and we are Polish, so they didn\u2122t talk to us, but later we told them not to worry about it. When we arrived in Retzow - this is very, not a very interesting, but that\u2122s again a personal story."

It\u2122s a mouthful: Haupstunshauf\u00fchrer (ph), and he had - there was a barrack, the German barrack where they worked, and it was this Haupstunshauf\u00fchrer (ph) and then they were kapos, women, and then they were guards in the camp. What we did there was when we arrived there, he lined us up for work. He needed about, I would say, 12 people I think or so to clean the German barracks. Some people were going out to work. I don\u2122t know what they did because we were either too short and I wasn\u2122t working outside. So, first of all, the cook came in and he picked Krysia. That was the biggest, you know, as if she won the lottery because - because if she is going to work in the kitchens, we would have what to eat because we just come from a place where we didn\u2122t eat for three days, and from Auschwitz where the food was so scarce that we were fainting most of the times. So, Krysia got the job in the kitchen. Then, they started picking people to clean the barracks. The Germans - those were the best jobs, don\u2122t misunderstand me, the best jobs. So, anyway, he picked me first, and he starte d picking people and Renia got also in this group. So, then he showed where we are going to live and so on, and then he showed - he told us where we are going to work. So, he picked me to work in his office. So, I figured, what am I going to do here in the office. I - I thought I\u2122m going to be a secretary or something. So, he comes in and he tells me - he asks me, \ufb01 Kannst du putzen?\ufb02 \ufb01Do you know how to clean?\ufb02 I think myself, \ufb01Of course I know - that\u2122s the best job I could get to clean those barracks.\ufb02 So, I said, like, but then I see, there is his desk with all the papers and the radio is playing. I think if I\u2122m going to play smart, I won\u2122t get this job, because, you know, I have to be dumb to know how to cl ean the floors. So, I decided that I\u2122m not going to tell him that I know German. I don\u2122t know why, but at that moment, my mind started working, and I figured to clean the floors, you don\u2122t need to be intelligent, just be as dumb as you can. So, he says, \ufb01Can you\u2013\ufb02 I\u2122ll speak English. \ufb01Can you speak German?\ufb02 So, I said [so-so gesture with hand]. And he said to me, \ufb01And how about - what do you speak?\ufb02 So, I said, \ufb01Polish.\ufb02 Polish he couldn\u2122t speak. So, he says to me, \ufb01So what can you do?\ufb02 So, I said, \ufb01 Putzen.\ufb02 I mean, he told me already that I\u2122m going to clean. So, that\u2122s what - I didn\u2122t know. I never did the - I never cleaned a floor in the house, in my house, never touched it. So, then he says to me, \ufb01When you clean, I don\u2122t want you to touch anything on my - on my desk because this is all private. I don\u2122t want - if you want to - from time to time, I\u2122ll clean it, and you will be able to clean.

Renia was cleaning another room. I would go back to Krysia - how she fed us. She was marvelous, but I\u2122ll go back to this portion. I\u2122ll just talk now about this situation here. So, I read everything and then, the Russians were already so close that he got orders that on such and such a date to let everybody go except the guards, because th ey weren\u2122t sending the Jews anymore to work, because they had to go out of the camp. So , that - we had the - like, we were Poles, but we took off our triangles because then the people that work outside had white crosses across the back with the paint. Like, whatever - if you worked outside, you had the white cross painted like this right acr oss the back. So, Krysia and I, we came to a conclusion that she works in the kitchen, she gets some fl our and water, and she\u2122ll be able to make the crosses, new crosses, on our clothes, because we - we had clothes there. We were also distributed some clothes for us because it was a small camp. It wasn\u2122t a big camp. We were all girls. And this, we decided that we are going to run away, but we had to have a strategy. We had a Jewish girl from Lubli n. She was blonde and had blue eyes, and she spoke perfect German. She was one of us wo rking in the barracks because there were either ten or twelve of us working the barracks. I don\u2122t remember. Since she could speak so well German, we decided th at she\u2122s going to steal the kapo\u2122s - you know, kapos were wearing a black cape, a black cape what covere d whatever - they didn\u2122t wear uniforms, just a black cape with a hood. So, she stole this hood from her, and then Krysia - we decided that what we can do to take the crosses off, all we had to do is this, is to just crumbled the - like we had to wear the crosse s inside, but in order to get outside, to run away from camp - I knew exactly because my boss didn\u2122t come to work that day. I don\u2122t know whether he came later or so, because it was ten days before the end of the war - ten 101 or twelve days before the end of the war. So, in the morning, we got up this Helena was her name - she put on the cape, we made sure that there was no sign of the cross, and she - we came to the gate. She told the post th at she registers with him ten people going to work outside, whatever - she knew what to say, where outside, and he says - he showed us to go. We went to the road, and all - fr om there on, we didn\u2122t have to worry because all the Germans were running towards west. They were afraid. The Russians were very close, so the Germans were leaving their homes and everything marching, running away from the Russians. They were afraid. So, we were in the group. Nobody noticed us. Nobody bothered us, but we didn\u2122t have what to eat and we didn\u2122t know what to do. But, we run away. We\u2122re out of the camp. As a ma tter of fact, one girl from Radom that I suggested that she goes with us, she didn\u2122t want to go because she had - somebody gave her spreads - some sardines, a box of sardines. She had it with someone. She didn\u2122t want to leave it, or she didn\u2122t - she didn\u2122t want to give it to her, and she didn\u2122t want - because she wanted to eat it, she didn\u2122t want to run away. So, they went to another camp from there, you know, after - the Russians were - they must have gotten orders to go more west, but we were already free. So, we - that was it. Those were the camps. Now, Krysia - she worked in the kitchen so, she stuck, you know, she cooked and she - she was sending to us - she was working on the second floor and so, we - we used to go under - stand under the kitchen and have our metal thi ng with the handle. She would push down a string. We would put the string on the handle. She roped it, and she would take - because there was meat, like horse meat, but we didn\u2122t get it; the Germans - the Germans got it. We only got the soup. So, she would take a t ongue or whatever, you know, she had there a big piece - a big piece of meat she would send it back. We would take it and divide among all the girls. So, everybody had something, not only something to eat, but we were not used to such - so rich food. It was tremendous. One day she tells me this story. She worked there. She stole a pound of butter. It was, you know, one of those pounds in foil, and she says she didn\u2122t know what to do with it because, I mean, the Germans was - her boss, the German cook, was watching her. So, she put it in her pants so that she could take the butter to take to us, and when she started working and cleaning up, the butter started dripping, and she got so scared she almost died. She - but anyway, she managed somehow to bring the butter - th e butter to feed us. So, we really in Retzow we didn\u2122t have a bad day, because she was supplying a ll the food. She was stealing it, but she was supplying all the food and nobody - all the girls that knew, they noticed that I went out to get whatever, they were already waiting. I mean everybody was hungry. So, that was also lucky. We were lucky there. Bu t, this is all about Retzow. There\u2122s very - we don\u2122t have much to say about it because we weren\u2122t there too long."

So, we decided to get off the road, and just managed to go back - to walk back, but we were afraid because this way where we were going west, nobody could - nobody was suspecting us of running away from cam p. We\u2122re running away to the west where all the Germans, you know, with all their possible treasures that they had. They had horse and wagons and stuff like that, and they were all going west running away from the Russians, but then at one point, we decided, all ten of us, we had one Russian girl, not Jewish, with us, too. Most of the girls were Jewish. Helena was also Jewish, but she didn\u2122t look it. She spoke perfect German. She could get away with being German just in case if something would happen, and we got o ff the road and we started going through this forest. We started going back home. Back home!
