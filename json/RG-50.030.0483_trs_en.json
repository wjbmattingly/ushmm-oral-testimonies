            "answer": "Oh my God. Well, my childhood -- course in Austria as you probably know, I didn\u2019t stay there very long. I mean I -- I was born in Vienna. My father was Hungarian, my mother German, and they went to Vienna, it\u2019s no secret really, because my father\u2019s family would not have my mother, who was a very pretty young actress, much younger than my father, but extremely pretty, well they would not have her in Hungary, not at -- at his place. So he had to give all this up, and he did, he gave it all up for her and bought a flat in Vienna, and came to live in Vienna, which 1s -- [ -- it must have been -- I didn\u2019t know him, you know, he died when I was two, so I never knew him, but I gather he was a charming man, I bet he was. But he was 30 years older than she. So it -- one can imagine, can\u2019t one?"

            "answer": "Well, ideas, my mother didn\u2019t have ideas, she was an actress, and she was very beautiful, and she was you know, surrounded by elegant and charming men, which was rather nice, you know, I rather enjoyed that. But she was very childlike. And she -- she certainly liked la grande vie, and she created this grande vie, which was, I think, brave of her. She continued to have it after my father died, when there was some money, but not much. And when it was gone she was particularly brave because she spoke absolutely perfect English, and she took to translating plays, which was -- course was a very, very good thing at the time in Vienna because they had no plays of their own in the 20\u2019s. Later, Thomas Bennett came, but there were no Austrian playwrights. Well, of course there were the -- Schnitzler and old ones, you know, but not modern ones. So all the plays came from France and England, and America, too, but England was the -- and she did rather well, and she worked extremely hard. This I respected, I mean I -- I -- you know, I -- I think that I learned a lot from that, because I -- I -- I didn\u2019t respect her for her childishness. I --I did think that, you know, by the time I was 10, I felt that really she should be more grown up. But -- but I did respect her staying up late, late, late into the night working so that she could get -- offer us this life, which she thought was essential. Of course, I would never have thought it was essential. But she did."

            "answer": "Well, they were partly actors, and partly ar -- aristocrats, because she was very -- as I said, she was very -- you know, a very sort. She went out a lot, she had absolutely beautiful clothes made by a little seamstress from models. The seamstress came once a week for two days. Abso --"

She had a lot of clothes, and she would go to all the sales, sometimes dragging me along, and buy these abso -- the remnants, you know, of beautiful, beautiful materials. And this little seamstress, who was absolutely splendid, and was able to copy models. So anyway, all this, this was the sort of child life, until I was 11, and then by this time I had changed schools, had gone from, you know, my elementary school, which was a very ordinary state school, which I loved. I loved school anyway. I had gone to a rryah gimnasium, which is sort of -- you know, a private high school for girls, called Lueetlan. And -- and at 11 I was sent to England. My brother -- I had a brother who was four years older than I, Guido. Guido had already been sent to England years before, also at -- no he -- he ma -- he was sent at 12 actually, because my father wanted us brought up in England, which was a very wise idea, I think. I mean, he also wanted us brought up in France, which also happened, so you know -- not my brother, but I. So I -- I was able to speak these languages, you know, which is good. And then I came back to Vienna to go to dramatic school."

And the train, they couldn\u2019t find --- well, I gath -- I gather they couldn\u2019t find a train to replace it, so they had to repair it, which was going to take five hours. And so the -- there was another child on this train by itself, so we were unaccompanied children. I was in my school uniform, which is brown and green, and the German Red Cross took us over, this little girl and me, who was also going to school, not my school, but another school, and took us to the party day. And we were taken to the -- there was a children\u2019s sort of gallendare if you -- 1f you know what that means. I mean, it was just a -- you know, rows and rows of -- of -- of benches going up, all children, it was only children. And so we were taken way up, because there was -- there wasn\u2019t any space, as you can imagine. But they put us in there, and I just thought it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. It was absolutely magnificent. And you know, all the -- the -- the -- this wonderful rhythm and these -- these -- these clean looking boys and -- and girls -- I mean and also marching, you know, people. And then of course there were these speeches, and I had absolutely no idea what they were saying. I mean, I didn\u2019t understand a word. But I screamed like everybody else. I mean, I thought it was just so exciting. I had never been so excited in my life, I think. The colors, and the -- I don\u2019t know, the -- the music, and the -- the rhythm, you know, there was just -- it was theater like you - one -- it\u2019s almost indescribable of course, you -- you\u2019ve seen it, everybody has seen it on film. But of course here I was actually seeing it, you know, and the colors are quite different when you are actually watching these -- these -- these flags wave, you know, in the wind. And you\u2019re there, and they\u2019re -- and you -- you get the wind, the -- that the s -- that the flags made, that they were all -- all around, they were everywhere, and there were thousands of flags. It was just beautiful. And anyway, so I -- I screamed like everybody else, heil, heil, and I don\u2019t know who he was -- I didn\u2019t know who he was, but anyway --"

            "question": "Did you have any idea what it was about, what it signified?",
            "answer": "No, I knew it was the German National -- you know, I knew he was the leader of Germany, and I knew that I had heard of course grown-ups, my mother -- my -- my mother\u2019s friends. I had heard people say that he was a bad man, but of course I had no idea why he should be a bad man, it was so pretty. Why should he be bad, you know? And -- and to me it was just absolutely wonderful, as to everybody else there. So anyway then -- then there was the interesting thing, which I have written about, I came to -- came to school in England. I had this wonderful teacher whom I adored, Lee Hindly. She died fairly recently. Lee Chadwick afterwards. Well Lee Hindly, who I thought was a -- you know, fantastically grown up lady, becau -- I think she was 24, I mean -- and she was a very, very English, English girl -- young woman, with this wonderful voice, and this -- you know, this -- this absolutely beautiful -- not o -- Oxford English, but just the real sort of -- I-I can\u2019t describe it, I mean, I just thought it was divine, and of course she taught me every word I learned. I mean, I knew -- I didn\u2019t know a word of English when I came there. And she was very, very kind, and I adored her. Anyway, I arrived back to school and -- and I wrote this -- we were supposed to write this, you know, this [indecipherable] this eg -- essay about our most beautiful day of the holidays. Well, naturally I wrote about this. And -- and she read it, and -- and having read all the others, a prize was given for a girl who wrote -- little girl who wrote about a stallion having -- I mean, not a stallion, a -- a -- a horse having a baby, I me -- wonderful, wonderful story. And -- and she -- she said to me, that\u2019s a very good job of work, so that was enough for me. And then she said, \u201cCan you stay here a minute afterwards?\u201d After the lessons, so I did. And she said, \u201cI brought this for you, and I want you to read it.\u201d And she gave me this book, in English. And I said, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d It said Mein Kampf in German underneath, and said, you know, my battle. And I said, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, the man you saw speak wrote this book about his plans for Europe, and I want you to read it.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d And she said, \u201cBecause anybody who comes from your corner of the world needs to read this book.\u201d She -- I later found out, I didn\u2019t know this, nobody knew this -- she was a member of the Communist party, and she became really very active indeed. In fact, you know later, much later, years later, she became a councilor for the Communist party in Oldeburough, in Laseton where she lived, having married twice, and so on. Anyway, she was -- she continued to be absolutely wonderful. And I read this book. I mean, I can\u2019t say I read this book, but I read into this book. It was impossible for me to read the whole book, you know. I wa --"

            "answer": "I was -- yes, I was 11. I mean, I was -- I was 11 and a half by then, because it was six months- I\u2019d been in this school for six months by then. And you know, I -- I did understand it. I mean, I would -- well, I would have said probably I read a third of it, you know, read here -- reading here and there, and there, and there, jumping, of course, which she knew I would. I mean it was impossible to read for -- for an 11 year old. But I -- I knew perfectly well that -- I saw perfectly well. I never understood how people told me afterwards they -- well, they couldn\u2019t read it to start out with, they hadn\u2019t read it, which was a lie. Everybody said they hadn\u2019t read it. All -- all ger -- I don\u2019t think I -- well no, I did meet some Germans who admitted to having read it, but most Germans, including Speer, indeed, said they hadn\u2019t read it, that you know it was that Hitler wa -- ca -- In Speer\u2019s case, Hitler told him it was -- it was way over, it was -- it was too late, not to bother. I mean, so many things had happened that it was -- we were holed, as they said. Anyway, so I brought it back to Lee, to Miss Hindly, and -- and she said, \u201cWell what did you think of it?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I da -- I -- two things. I mean, what I -- I mean, how is he go -- I mean, he wants to -- he wants Europe, he wants to rule over Europe, that seems quite clear. But how can he do this,\u201d I ask, \u201cwithout a war?\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m asking you, you tell me.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I mean, other countries aren\u2019t just going to give him their country.\u201d And she said, \u201cUh- huh, mm-hm.\u201d And I said, \u201cAnd what is he going on about the Jews? I mean, he keeps talking about the Jews, and he says awfully nasty things about them.\u201d And she said, \u201cHe hates them.\u201d So I said, \u201cBut why?\u201d And she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. You will have to make up your mind yourself in the end. Learn it, read, and maybe you'll find out.\u201d But of course I never did until, you know, until I did this work, which I did much later. Probably this is where of my -- my wish to do something started, without my knowing it, of course, you know. Anyway, that\u2019s my childhood."

            "answer": "Well, I think actually I d -- I didn\u2019t say that, I think of a -- ba -- I said something slightly different, my -- I think my most important time was -- the two moments, both when I worked with children. First during the war, when I was in France, because the war came when I had been sent to study in France. And I stayed, I\u2019d -- I fell in love with an English boy, and I was not going to go to -- my mother had married somebody in Geneva, and had gone to live in Geneva, and I was damned if I was going to live in Geneva. Sh -- they put me into a pensionnat de jeune filles there, you know, and I ran away. I mean, it was just outrageous. Somebody who had been in the Reinhardt [indecipherable] you know -- you know, to be then put into a pensionnat de jeune filles, I mean, you must imagine this, us walking in twos, you know? I mean outrageous. Anyway, so I ran away. But they were quite sensible, and they left me in -- in France, and they -- finally my -- my mother and stepfather -- and they very sweetly, you know, paid for me to live with a family then, which was the most sensible thing. I mean, I was 15. So anyway -- I can\u2019t remember what I said. Oh yes, well the war came, and I decided to work in a ca -- in a -- with an organization called the Auxiliaire Soc-Sociale, who were taking care of -- well really, what we later called displaced persons, but that is not -- they were called refugees then -- came into Paris from, you know, all the places that the Germans had already overrun. And I was put in charge by the -- the person who was a -- who was the president of this organization, a woman called Isabelle de la Bouillerie, who came -- who was in my life for quite awhile afterwards. Anyway, Isabelle put me in charge of the nursery. And we had a nursery for -- we -- we took -- didn\u2019t took take away, but we -- we accepted, and the women who came with small babies were absolutely delighted, you know, after walking in the -- on the roads with small babies, they were all exhausted. I mean, that was the main thing that I think I -- I experienced for the first time, you know, the exhaustion of people who run away. It is just terrible. And if you ha -- if you are holding onto perhaps a small child and a baby, as many of them were, it -- 1t was killing. It was killing. They were -- they all arrived, you know, filthy and pale, and oh, awful. And when we offered to take the babies and they could come and see the babies whenever they liked, of course. Some of them were nursing the babies and they came quite often, but anyway, in the night I mean. We didn\u2019t have a single nerve, not a single one. And we ended up at one point with 56 babies in that room. And we had -- we had American members of the Auxiliaire Sociale who were very rich, and it was absolutely extraordinary because first we started of course, with six babies, you know, and we had eight cots. And I said to one of the -- to this woman, who -- this American who was part of the organization, I said, \u201cYou know, I think there are going to be a lot more.\u201d And she said, \u201cHow many do you think there might be?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, 10 - 20?\u201d She said, \u201cRight.\u201d And you know, it was not two hours later that 20 cots arrived, and two nights later we had 56, and they came during the day, and we had 56 cots by that night."

We had a lot of baby clothes, again, from all these people who were very rich, who was in the Auxiliaire Sociale. So we had mountains of material, so we were able to change them, and of course this made the mothers incredibly happy, suddenly to be able to be without them for a little while, know where they are, they were safe, they were being cleaned.

            "answer": "-- oh, sorry, from the fifth of May, I think to the 20\" of May. And by the 20\" of May, we knew that we were -- we were going to be left with any number of abandoned children, or lost children, or orphan children. And we set up again, because all these people, you know, all these backers of the Auxiliaire Sociale, lucky they were very rich, and many of them had castles in various corners of -- of France and we got a series of castles -- part of castles put at our disposal for them -- for starting children\u2019s centers. And I took 16 kids on -- I can\u2019t remember the date, but it was the end of May, before the Germans came into Paris, just before to -- to Villandry, which was one of the great chateaux of the Loire, and belonged to Isabelle de la Bouillerie, or rather her mother, who was American. Ann Crawford -- I can\u2019t remember what her se -- second name was. Anyway, she had married this Spaniard, who owned this wonderful castle. And they gave us the stables, and they had -- before we came they had some of the castle workers, you know, put beds, iron bedsteads and mattresses into -- and upstairs, they had actually in the stables, I don\u2019t know why. And this is where we had our children\u2019s center. And actually we ended up with I think 20 or 21 children. So that was all right, it was -- 1t was a very -- you know, it was a -- it was certainly for me an incredible lesson when the Germans arrived, and I adore the French. I mean, I was so pro-French, for no reason. I mean, I had nothing to fear with the Germans, and I had no reason to dislike the Germans, except what I had heard, all these elegant people around my mother say -- some of them -- some of them of course were Jews, because you know, most of the- most of the theater people really were Jewish, and -- and most of -- my mother was -- had a lot of newspaper friends, there were a lot of Jews. And so I -- I certainly heard in ma -- my subconscious I heard more things than in my conscious, but I had a real dislike for the Germans, which when they actually came into France, I couldn\u2019t find a reason for. They were very nice when they came to France. They were very nice to the French. They were absolutely charming to me. You know, I had a -- a -- a -- I was introduced by Isabelle, of course it was not beyond making use of whatever she could make use of, so she introduced me with my father\u2019s title, which of course didn\u2019t give me anything at all, but she invented one. So -- because the -- in Hungary the daughter of a count has no title. So -- but I very quickly became countess, and they absolutely adored that, they loved this little Hungarian countess, you know, who spoke perfect German -- Viennese German at that, Volksdeutsch with a [indecipherable] art, you know, loved it -- if you understand that."

Anyway, so -- so I became her -- Isabelle\u2019s interpreter, which was very useful for her, but extremely useful for me, because I -- you know, I learned more, I think, from that than I could have learned any other way. I mean, I spoke to so many Germans, most of them as I say, very nice. As the year went on, and things began to happen, you know, people began to be locked up, including friends of mine in Paris, it was less nice. And of course I was able to approach them on this, I mean ask them why, you know. And of course, a lot of Jews in Paris were arrested, which Isabelle learned about very quickly, as she had a very wide circle. And -- and I -- I -- I challenged them on that. And you know, most of them really didn\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t know. Of course, most of the people we saw were army officers, you know, they were -- those were the people who came to see the chateaux. I mean, you weren\u2019t going to have the privates come and see chateaux, on the whole. So the army officers, most of them professional army officers, they didn\u2019t know. They said, \u201cWell, you know, it\u2019s the law, it\u2019s the law.\u201d And I -- I would ask, \u201cWhy is it the law?\u201d I had great argument with two people who -- and this is the terrible thing, it\u2019s a terrible -- I\u2019ll never forget that, I -- I mean, I\u2019m partly to blame for what happened, I think. Isabelle became very friendly with a German doctor, and a -- I wrote about that, the -- so you know about it already, a da -- da -- a school -- former school director. And they came all the time. I mean, they came -- I think they must have come three times a week at least, to have tea with her, to have lunch with her, to have dinner even with her, you know, and she always called me in whenever I could get away from the children, and we both -- she very elegantly, and me not elegantly at all, would challenge them on all these things. Her secretary, who she had with her, was Jewish, Jacqueline, I can\u2019t remember her other name, and she was very protective of -- of certainly of Jacqueline, and I think of -- or we -- two of our Auxiliaire nurses -- well, yeah, but they weren\u2019t nurses, they were like me, I mean we were volunteers, and a mother and daughter, very good looking, were both Jew -- well, obviously both, but they were Jewish. So she was very protective of them, and these two people just took it, you know. And they -- I would ask and ask and ask, and they would say there is no explanation, it is the law, and most people agree with it, and blah, blah, blah, and blah, blah, blah. Anyway, this went on and on, and one day they disappeared."

And I went to see him, and I said, \u201cThese were our friends, what\u2019s happened -- well, these are our friends, where are they?\u201d And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want you ever to ask about them again.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, but you have to tell us what happened, if you know what happened. Where are they?\u201d And he said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid they were arrested.\u201d I said, \u201cBut why?\u201d And he said, \u201cBecause they saw too much of you French.\u201d And I don -- then later, you know, also through him, found out that the doctor was sent to the Russian -- to the Russian front, and he was killed very soon. He was the -- sent as a medic, but he was killed very soon. And -- and the school director was sent to a concentration camp, he was fat. You know, he was -- he -- 1-impossible for him to do anything in a concentration camp, he couldn\u2019t have. And he died, too. So you know we -- we really -- I mean this is something we - we -- we really made their lives, I think, very unhappy these last weeks they had, which 1s quite awtul. Anyway, there you are. That\u2019s how, you know, how it went there. Anyway, by this time, I was doing little things, very small things, nothing of note, nothing heroic for -- for the resistance. B -- it was just starting, you know, the resistance really, in 1941 barely existed, barely. It existed in places like Paris, and Lyon, but in the countryside of course, there was no resistance, I mean good God. So what we did, the only things we did was on two occasions we managed to -- we managed to take care of some British fliers who -- who crashed, and who happened to crash -- one of them actually crashed in the park, which was extremely convenient, yes. But the other one crashed, and somehow made his way to us, so we hid these two. And we hid them by putting them in the children\u2019s dormitory. The children just loved it. The two oldest boys gave up their beds. I mean, one on one occasion, and the other on the other occasion. And these bo -- these boys, you know, these young RAF boys, I mean, they were -- they were 18 - 19. I mean, they were children. And they -- our children were so excited.

            "answer": "Well, you know, that was the -- the odd thing, because this is the first time, of course, I saw them again since 1934. So I was not -- you know, I was not as concerned as, of course, some of my mother\u2019s friends were, and my mother. My mother ha -- was very concerned. She had become engaged to a famous economist called Ludwig von Mises, who was Jewish, and -- but a very, very eminent man, and who is -- who had been already, for four years at the Ecole de Zoadsetude in Geneva, so he was not there. I mean, they would -- he would come back every summer to go mountain climbing with her, that was their thing, and they were -- they were real, real country nuts, real mountain nuts. I hardly knew him. I mean, he was -- he didn\u2019t come close to me at all, there was -- very severe man, I thought. I couldn\u2019t -- I could not understand how she could be in love with him, but there you are, there you are. And so -- so this was a worry of course, that she -- that she was very concerned, she was very worried about all of it. And -- and then of course, you know, it began, I mean you -- you -- you -- there were an awf -- as I told you, there were an awful lot of -- of Jews in the theater world, and I was at the Reinhardt seminar which was -- well, I mean, Reinhardt of course was a Jew. He was not there, I mean he had left in -- he was in Vienna last -- I can\u2019t remember, but I think it was in January of that year. He had done a wonderful production at his theater, which we all, of course, went to the rehearsals, and it was just absolutely wonderful. But then he left, and with him his -- his wife, Helene Thimig, who was -- you know, for whom we all -- I mean, we just adored her, I mean she was the most wonderful actress. I mean, probably there were two great, great actresses in Austria. There was she, and Paula Wessely, two really great actress, and of course we, as very young people, we -- we just had adorations for these people, you know. Anyway, she left. That was a blow because we -- we did find out that she left because Reinhardt was a Jew, and he thought that the Germans were coming in. And he was damn right. He thought that the Austrians would not be able to withstand it, and he thought they were -- this I found out much later, but I mean, this is what happened. So, you know, I was a little bit preconditioned against them by this time, all this. And then they came in, and it was really quite strange, because you know, Vienna didn\u2019t suit them, or they didn\u2019t suit Vienna. I mean, they -- they were -- they were incredibly different. I mean, the Viennese are -- I mean, I don\u2019t necessarily like the Viennese all that much, but they -- the -- the - they are a very special breed, and it\u2019s not a German breed. It just isn\u2019t. You know, it -- it -- it -- it dates back to the empire, the -- this extraordinary mixture, if you take a Viennese telephone book -- I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019ve ever done this, you take a Viennese telephone book, and you will see all the names in the world, I mean Polish, Czech, it\u2019s all from eastern Europe, Hungarian. And you will hardly see German names. You know, and this -- this speaks -- this -- this says something, you know, and so when these Germans came in, all just like in 1934, looking wonderful, clean, you know, beautiful. They were beautiful men, but they didn\u2019t fit. They didn\u2019t fit.

And a -- there were these two women\u2019s parts, Natasha and Natalia, I think. And I played one of them, and we had two casts, who would play alternative -- you know, alternately, for a week. And I was in the first cast. And th-the play was being -- there -- there\u2019s a story, there\u2019s -- the play was being produced -- directed by of course a student, but under the supervision of a man called Geyer, G-e-y-e-r, who was the most charming man. He was the -- he was the director of a big theater in Vienna called the Volkes theater, and he was one of our teachers. I mean, they were all people like that, you see? And -- and he was charming. He was incapable of ever telling anyone that he was no good. So everybody adored him, you know. And he had given these parts, he had you know, assigned these parts to the people he wanted. And the girl who had my part in the second cast, I thought was very good, you know? And suddenly it was taken away from her. And there was sort of gossip going on that Neidafuhr had taken it away from her, and she was absolutely in despair. And it is only much later that I found out that she was Jewish, because you know, really nobody- this is something that people find very difficult to understand, but really we didn\u2019t know who was Jewish.

Then I realized that she had been taken -- that he had taken -- when I saw him with the swastika, I discussed it with some friends, and we decided, having then -- by then found out that she was Jewish, that he had taken it away from her because she was Jewish."

I mean, which then I gained of course in the -- and -- and exercised on these poor two Germans who we became friends with, you know. But that -- back home in \u201938 -- I mean in Austria, we had -- there was less civic conscience around than -- than you can possibly imagine. I mean, good God, they de -- they haven\u2019t had any civic conscience until 1986 when Waldheim -- when the Waldheim story arose, then civic conscience at last became a reality in Austria, and now, it\u2019s different. But it\u2019s taken a long time, hasn\u2019t it? Anyway, in \u00b038 -- listen, the long and short of it is that the Viennese were absolutely delighted by the arrival of the na -- of the Germans. And of course, it was not only the -- the Viennese, I mean the Austrians were delighted, and one has to see this unemotionally as one can. Austria was a country that was economically unviable. It only existed in tourism. There was no other way for Austria to exist. And since -- I mean, now of course I found out so much more, you know, I know so much more now than I did, I didn\u2019t know any of this of course, because I was -- I had absolutely nothing to do with politics, but I know now, I mean that -- that the social democrats, can you believe it, were the first, who in the early 20\u2019s wanted an annexi -- an -- an annexation to Germany. You see? Without -- I mean, at that time of course, they were not the Nazis, but they were -- this -- this anschluss to Germany was the thing that had gone through the 20\" century, the early 20\" century, and the more people realized, after the empire died, that the only way that Germany -- that Austria could survive was as part of Germany. The more people, you know, felt this, and this was not -- really not because they were -- I mean, in America you see mostly, but also elsewhere, this became a -- well, it became thought of as everything stemming from anti-Semitism, and this isn\u2019t true, never was true. Of course the -- all -- a -- Austria, you know, was -- was -- was -- behaved absolutely atrociously about it\u2019s Jews. I mean, really atrociously, worse than the Germans. But it -- 1t was not really -- that was not the reasons why they wanted the Germans, it was economic. And the ideological part was very small. Very powerful, but very small. Very powerful, alas. And becoming more powerful all the time. As the Germans came in, things became much better very quickly. And for the first year they were there -- and I was not there then any more because my mother really had to leave, you know, with being this -- this marriage well known -- I mean, this about to be married to Louie -- to Lou. So we -- we left at the end of May, so I was only there for two months, in Nazi -- occupied Nazi -- not occupied, Nazi Vienna, really.

What are you doing there?\u201d I said, \u201cDid -- did you realize that one of these men -- I mean, I don\u2019t know who the others are, but one of these men 1s a savior of lives? He saved my life when I was a baby.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat are you, a Jew?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, but what does that got to do with it?\u201d And -- but Elfie was much more effective than I, because I was rather dumpy little girl. I mean, I was not ugly, but I was dumpy, you know. I was not a beauty at all. She was a raving beauty. She was a dancer you know, she has a wonderful little body, and -- and she was am -- actually a few months younger than I, I think she was still 14.

I mean, it was the most beautiful thing you can imagine, I mean she -- she really was su -- I mean, people would turn around in the street when we walked along the street, I mean, she was so incredible. And she had a wonderful voice, and then she became an operetta star. But never mind. She wen -- she was go -- we were both going up to these -- to these characters. And she said, \u201cIs that what you call our liberation?\u201d And she sang it out, you know, and it -- it we -- I think the whole street must have heard it, in this wonderful -- she had this wonderful voice, and she had -- really she was working extremely hard at the seminar on her voice, because she had this beautiful singing voice, too. And so they -- they really- they -- she -- they all knew she was going to be a star. I mean, there was just no doubt, she was so beautiful, you know, and talented, I mean she was talented. She was not a great dr-dramatic talent, but oh, wonderful personality. And do you know, it was really the most extraordinary thing that you can imagine. All these people who\u2019 ve been around there laughing, you know, and- and -- was disgusting, it was a disgusting sight, they all melted away. I don\u2019t think it took more than five seconds and they were gone. And then these two characters disappeared, and then there were only these people, all still on their knees. I don\u2019t know how many there were, you know, I didn\u2019t count them. And then slowly they got up and they disappeared. And then prof -- Dr. Berggrin, he was a professor as a matter of fact, Dr. Berggriin came up to us, with his wife, he -- which I now realize that was his wife, little woman, little round woman. Oh, her face, you know, was just so exhausted, and so frightened. And he said in a very severe voice, \u201c\u201cYou must never do this again, never. It is very dangerous for you.\u201d And then I found out they killed him, later. They killed him in Sobibor in \u201943. And her, no doubt, I mean I -- you know, I only found this out much later, but that was absolutely terrible, and of course it stayed with us. Elfie too. You know, Elfie, too, I mean I left and then I -- but Elfie and I remained in correspondence for a long time, until she really didn\u2019t dare to write any more. But she -- she really loathed them. She loathed them also partly because she found out that her father had been an illegal Nazi, and -- and he had told her, the day before this happened, on the 13\" of March, my birthday, he had told her that -- or was it even on the 12\", at dinnertime, he said that she was never to talk to any Jew again, and that all these s-sou -- Saujuden they called them, they would all be taken care of, or whatever, you know, eliminated. And she told me this. She was in despair. She was really in despair, because we loved all these teachers, you see. They were very important to us, I mean they were our lives. They were very important people in Vienna, but it was not because of that we loved them. They were -- even those -- I mean there was one who was actu -- actually really disliked by everybody except me. It\u2019s really true, I was the only person who liked him. He was the director of Reinhardt\u2019s theater, his name was Anslotter, and he was a fine novelist. He wrote really wonderful novels, which I had read all his novels, so I liked him already for that. And then for some or other reason he liked me, I don\u2019t know why, but he did, because I really was not a -- I was not a -- well, I mean there were very talented people at the -- you know f-for -- for acting at the -- at the school, and I was not one of the most talented ones.

They needed people with languages, and of course they needed to -- they were very keen to have somebody who already had experience with children -- with children such as the children I had taken care of in France. And so I -- I was sent -- I was engaged as a -- as an assistant, because I was young, an assistant child welfare officer. I then became a -- you know, I was promoted, but I went there in a rather junior position, and I\u2019m trying to think where my first assignment was. Yes, my first assignment -- well, I was first, as a matter of fact, my very first assignment was in Dachau, which was quite a shock because I\u2019d -- I didn\u2019t realize that that would be my first assignment. We were all -- we all went first to a t -- a -- a city called Karlsruhe, which was the -- the western allied headquarters for UNRRA. And a huge, huge sort of -- oh, it was this -- you know, former I don\u2019t know what it was, but hundreds of barracks and things, and -- and that\u2019s where we all stayed for awhile, had various lessons 1n this and that, and orientation, and then were assigned from there. And to my great surprise, I was called in and I was told that I was going to Dachau. And I said, \u201cBut there are no children in Dachau.\u201d And the -- the woman who was talking to me, she said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have a rather shocking surprise.\u201d Which I did. I really did have a shocking surprise, because there were a lot of children. Of course, Dachau was not -- you know, Dachau is much misunderstood in the -- in the literature, and by historians. Dachau, as you probably know, was the fi -- I shouldn\u2019t be addressing you, but anyway, Dachau was the first concentration camp the Nazis opened, and it was purely a political camp. It was for -- it was intended for German political prisoners, and some cr -- and some criminal prisoners, who usually became, in fact, the kapos. It was not intended for Jews at all. And later it was represented as an extermination camp, which it never was. I have just read a -- a completely new book, which in fact has not yet been published, but is about to be published in three weeks in America, and it still has this presentation of it, which is really a great shame. This is particularly in America that they misrepresented. It is as if it\u2019s a need, always to associate, you know, the Nazis with the crime against the Jews. Now, of course, all of us who write, up to a point, have to do this, because it was the worst thing they did, and you cannot not do it. But if you do that exclusively, then you are misrepresenting history. And you\u2019re misrepresenting what Hitler was, what his plan was, what the whole thing was, and why the danger was so enormous, you know, for the whole of Europe, or the world. I mean, the death of the Jews was the worst thing, of course, and the factory killings, and -- but it was -- basically it was a part of a huge geopolitical program which really the -- most of the world doesn\u2019t know because it has so focused on that one part of it. And it\u2019s understandable, I mean, emotion is understandable, but historically it\u2019s wrong. Anyway, so when I came to Dachau, there was -- there were all these kids. And there were two groups of kids, which is also extremely interesting. There were the child -- there were no Jewish children, virtually no Jewish children. Maybe one or two somewhere, but this was not -- you know, the Jewish children -- no, there were more than one or two, there were -- there were a few, but it was- there -- that was the easiest. They brought in -- UNRRA had a -- had a special issue, like a special division for taking care of -- of Jews who survived the Nazis, and they very sensibly assigned to this, or made responsible for this division, Jewish UNRRA officials. I mean, it was the right thing to do, because they understood better, and they can deal with it better, and they could -- and they would be accepted much better by these victims. And so this is what happened. So in Dachau too, within da -- I mean, I came there very soon after it was -- after the Americans arrived. I mean, really within days. And within -- again within days, some of UNRRA officers arrived, who took away the Jewish children. That was -- you know, that was wonderfully organized. So I was left with another -- with another UNRRA. I think she was -- I think she was a higher rank than I. But anyway, we were friends, though, and oh became -- had become friends. And we put in -- were in charge of these children. And you have -- these were all on the one hand, children whose parents had been brought into -- into Germany as forced laborers. So they were mostly Polish and Russian children. They spoke no German, they spoke Polish and Russian, and a few words of German here and there. Some Czech children, but mostly, as I say, it was eastern European children, who had either been brought in by themselves, or they had been brought in after their parents had been taken in with them. Because in quite many -- in quite a few cases, the Nazis brought in people from eastern Europe to work in Germany, letting them take their smaller children. In quite a few cases, not -- not -- not -- not -- it was not a rarity. So we were landed with quite a few quite young children, who couldn\u2019t speak [indecipherable] the girl who was -- sorry, the girl who was with me was of Polish descent, an American of Polish descent. She spoke Polish, which was a great help. Anyway, so that was one group, and the other group were German children. And they were the children of the 20\" of July German officers, who had been in the assassination plan against Hitler. This was an extraordinary thing, because here you had these German children, who had gone to elite schools, you know, who were very, very German children."

You couldn\u2019t -- I mean, this was a terrible place, because while it had been intended for -- as I told wa- told you before, what -- what -- what it was intended for by the Germans originally, but over the last -- over the last six months of the war, as the war turned against the Germans, they walked people from the eastern camps, including Auschwitz and so on, they walked them all the way down to -- to -- to southern Germany. And this camp, Dachau, which was meant for -- I cannot remember really how many, but certainly not more than five to eight thousand, and when I came there, there were 30,000. So I mean, it was just absolutely appalling, and impossible for the inmates, you know, to keep it clean. I mean, you ca -- if you -- 1 -- 1 -- one has to imagine, for instance, the hygienic possibilities, which really were perfectly all right, I\u2019m sure, when they started this thing.

And of course, the stolen children are a very, very important proof that it was not that. The stolen children were a part of Hitler\u2019s racial plan. And it was a racial, it was purely racial. These children all came, almost all -- there were some Greek children, but most of them, the vast majority, they were supposed to have been in -- I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t swear to this, a -- we were given this figure, and it may be right, it may not be right, but there was supposed to be 250,000 of them. And most of them, by far, far -- and the -- th -- this was -- of course, the -- the figure, which was confirmed by the Poles, because most of them came from Poland and the Ukraine. The Nazis had ordered that a certain number, and I don\u2019t know whether they put this number, I have no idea, but that their officials, who were specially assigned for this program, because this was a huge project, were to bring into Germany, children as of age one, who were blonde and blue eyed. They only wanted blonde and blue eyed children, which -- which of course turned out to be a total nonsense because almost all children are blonde and blue eyed when they\u2019re born, and remain this for, you know, quite a long time, into -- may well be two years. I mean, I had one little thing, a little girl, who I finally got, you know. And who had been -- who I found -- and who had been stolen, and who was apparently blonde and blue eyed. Her foster parents, as I call them, I mean they ri -- she s -- she thought they were her parents, and she adored them, her German parents. And they told me oh, she was the most beautiful blonde, blue eyed baby. And do you know she was almost black haired? And - and her eyes were brown. It was absolutely extraordinary, she was no -- and they had -- you know, they didn\u2019t see this. When this woman, she was in Wirtsburg -- I\u2019m going to start, this all comes back to me. This is not this Johann and -- and -- as I called them, yo -- mem -- Johann and Maria. These are just names I invented, you know, but this woman, when I -- when I saw this little girl, you know, who was adorable, by the way. But -- she was four, not three, she was four. And here\u2019s this dark haired, brown eyed child, who I wasn\u2019t at all sure wasn\u2019t Jewish. And this woman in Wirtsburg, this mum, who adored this child, went on and on about this lovely blue eyed, blonde child. I finally said that frau whatever her name was, \u201cShe\u2019s absolutely adorable, and you\u2019ve done a wonderful job with her, but she is very dark haired and brown eyed.\u201d [indecipherable], she said. And she -- and she looked, and st -- and really she gave me the impression -- I may be talking nonsense -- but she gave me the impression as if she had never noticed it. To her, this was the blonde, blue eyed baby who had been given to her. Now these children who were given only -- let me just say this, they were only given to members of the Nazi party of good s -- in good standing, who wanted children, who either couldn\u2019t have children, or whose children had died, or -- or whatever. There was always a good reason. And who were known to be, in all probability would be good parents. They were very, very careful about this.

One thinks that this is all so important, but of course, as I found out later, I mean it certainly -- I -- I -- [ -- it was not very good for my boy, who was, of course, in boarding school, but I mean, even so, it was not good for him. He didn\u2019t see very much of me. Well, anyway -- but these trials were, of course, fascinating, and it was fascinating to write about them, you know. And I learned an awful lot. But what -- what was most important to me in the end was that -- that it was not through trials that one could find out what these people were about, because trials are limited in what they can find out, however good the prosecutor is, you know. And this -- it happened to be the one -- the one who was involved in most of these trials in Dusseldorf was a very, very good prosecutor called Alfred Spiess, who became a great friend of mine, at last he died. But he -- he was a -- a very bright man, and he tried in fact, to enlarge these questions, too, because he also wanted to know, you know? But he had to find out that it was simply not possible. I mean, the courtroom does not lend itself to this. So this 1s where I really got the idea. Wit -- no, it wasn\u2019t where I got the idea, but certainly where the idea strengthened in my mind that -- that I wanted to find somebody I could talk to. One of these people who -- cause most of them, you see, just said they were not guilty, they -- you know, they -- they -- they -- they were acting under orders, which is true of course, they were acting under orders and they -- they couldn\u2019t have done anything but what they did, which of course is not true. But that\u2019s all they -- that\u2019s all, really, one got out of most of them. And I was looking for one where there was -- there was some remnant of conscience. I can\u2019t tell you how difficult that was. I mean, all the trials I saw, the one I found, finally found Stangl, was the only one And Spiess said the same thing. He may -- he -- you know, brought my attention to -- to Stangl, he really presented him to me. He -- he phoned me and said, \u201cLook, I think I\u2019ve now got the man here in front of me. You must come very quickly.\u201d And so I took the next plane to Dusseldorf, and went to the trial, to the Stangl trial, which went on for 10 months."

            "answer": "Yeah. I\u2019m not absolutely sure about that, but I think so. Anyway, it\u2019s in my book. And you know, after one day of sitting there, I knew that -- that -- that Spiess had hit the nail on the head. This was a slightly different man. It was -- the degree was very small, how he was different, but there was just -- there was a sadness about Stangl, which I had not found in any of the others, and which Spiess had not found in any of the others. They were arrogant, they were hard. They were proud of what they had done. Stangl was not proud. And quite aside from that, he was sad. And I thought, if he was capable of being sad, unless we find out that it\u2019s only about his situation, if he was capable of being sad about the whole thing, then there was that remnant of conscience, which of course I did find in him. Took me a long time. Took me a very long time to find it, but I did find it. And he was the right choice. I mean, I couldn\u2019t have done this with -- with any of the others. I met several of the others before, and of course after I met him. And -- and tried to talk to them, too. And only one of I met, who -- but he was not -- he was just not as intelligent. I mean, Stangl was not very intelligent, but he was more intelligent. And in fact, if he hadn\u2019t been more intelligent, he wouldn\u2019t have been given the job he was given. I mean, he was a -- he had an enormous job. I mean, commandant of Treblinka and commandant of Sobibor, you could not have a bigger job in that branch of the SS or Gestapo. It was impossible to have a bigger job. So of course he had the qualifications. He was a brilliant organizer, which is what was mostly needed. And -- and he was a -- he was a man, in a way -- don\u2019t misunderstand it, but he -- he was a man in a way, of quality, in that he had no -- no vices. He was not a drunkard, he didn\u2019t play around with women. He didn\u2019t, of course, didn\u2019t gamble, or anything like that. And he was not a man given to violence. So there were four things, which no doubt the Nazi bigwigs who appointed him saw just as much as I did. I mean, they had him first -- his first assignment, his first -- I mean, he was a police officer, of course, an Austrian. He was from Wels in Austria. He was a provincial. And his first assignment as a police officer, was to become the police head of Schloss Hartheim, which was a euthanasia institute. Bad enough, God knows. And there -- and th-these euthanasia institutes, where they appointed 96 SS people to become either heads or, you know, or officials there. Always in higher positions, of course. Under them they would have Ukrainians and Latvians, and usually Baltics. They could, of course observe and -- and see these quote, qualities, unquote, which I have mentioned. Because already in the euthanasia institute, I mean, it was quite clear that he had these qualities. And so he was -- he was predestined to be promoted, there\u2019s no doubt about it. And then he -- he -- he got these two jobs, first at -- in Sobibor, as a kind of preparation, which he opened, which he started, built. And then of course, the worst one of them all, Treblinka, I mean that was the worst place. Oh, I don\u2019t know whether any of them were worse than any other. I mean, the -- that\u2019s -- they -- they were places, you know, which only existed for killing, I mean, they were not for anything else. Which probably it\u2019s -- it\u2019s too extraordinary that -- that -- that 60 years later you have the same misapprehension, or miscomprehension of these places, which ha -- which existed then. I mean, even now, again, this book I\u2019ve just finished reading, which is about to come out in America, I mean again, I mean these places are -- Dachau is conc -- 1s -- is described as an extermination camp. I mean, total nonsense, you know, it\u2019s full of total nonsense. The -- the whole problem, which has been written about more than any other -- what, any other event in history, this extermination of the Jews, I mean it\u2019s -- really, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s ust incredible the number of books and -- and essays, and newspaper a -- films, what -- what have you, which have been done on this subject, and still people don\u2019t know. Too extraordinary. Anyway, there were only -- there were only four of such camps, which were only there for exterminating people, that nobody spent a night there, nobody had a meal there. Nobody washed there. They came in, they were killed, that\u2019s it."

            "answer": "And they had to get to Rome. I mean, they have to get Rome if they were going to get anywhere. And this is certainly what happened in Stangl\u2019s case. I mean, he was -- he was -- he went to this, he heard about this bishop, he went to him, he -- the bishop kept him there for a wh- a few days, to let him rest and to -- and to prepare the papers. And then he gave him the papers he needed, gave him some money. And of course this is a terrible thing, an absolutely terrible thing, but there you were. The Catholic church did many terrible things, they did many not terrible things. It\u2019s -- again, it\u2019s a gray area. Again, nothing is black and white. You know, and they were wonderful people, they were nuns. I mean, God almighty, what the nuns did in Austria and Germany is fantastic. You know, the number of people they hid, children. They hid Jewish children, but not you f -- for -- for a night or for a week, but for months, months. And you -- you have to try and imagine what it\u2019s like to live in a Nazi country, and to hide a number of Jewish grown-ups, Jewish children. It -- 1t -- it -- I mean -- you know, death was always around the corner, I mean just around the corner. And the Nazis had absolutely no reason to -- to -- to spare a nun. They disliked the nuns as much as they dus -- disliked anybody. They disliked the Catholics. So, 1t was dangerous. So if -- if we say, you know, that like this bishop, he ju -- he was doing terrible things by saving people such as Stangl, yes he did, he was. It was terrible. But just at the same time, there were wonderful people who saved people. And it is absolutely true that this bishop, of course, did not know what Stangl had done, because of course, he wasn\u2019t told. They were very careful not to tell him what these individuals had done. Would he have helped him anyway? I think he would have. Because A, I think he was a Nazi, and B, he was not a good man. I think he would have, but purely factually, he did not know who these people were."

But all these people who lived hidden lives, they all wanted to talk. I think that basically, I mean, if you want to talk ab -- if you want to consider this from a human point of -- or a humane point of view, I think they were all very lonely. You know, most of them were separated by prison and other, from their families, their wives, their children. I mean, certainly in Stangl\u2019s case this was so. Saw themselves sentenced, if not to death, because the death penalty had been abolished, but certainly to life in prison. You know, and they were young, I mean, they were not old men. Stangl, I can\u2019t remember how old he was, but he was certainly not more than what, 35 or 38, I mean he was -- he was young. And the earliest he could have got out of prison -- this is -- he was sentenced to life imprisonment, was when he was 60. Now just imagine a life like that. Well, I mean, course criminals, you know, we know this, this happens to -- to many criminals. But of course, he didn\u2019t consider himself a criminal, not until after he talked to me that he began to see what the rest of us thought. However, there were other reasons why he -- I think, why he -- at wa -- he talked -- he started to agree to talk to me because his appeal was going to come up, and he thought that I was going to help him. Now, I -- I -- I -- I -- \u2019d disabused him of this idea, because I had told him immediately that I would not help, and that what I would write would do absolutely nothing toward helping his appeal. But that if he talked to me, and if he talked to me fully, I would write everything he said, everything for, everything against, whatever he said, I would write it. And by this time there was the other element, which was A, Stangl -- you have to understand this, Stangl was an Austrian, this why I immediately said he was a provincial Austrian. And we talked to, in my kind of German, which is of course upper class German, we talked to by a young woman, which I was at the time -- I mean, a youngish woman. A youngish woman, you know, a -- somebody who represented something. A lady. He\u2019d never met a lady in his life. And suddenly there was this lady who was willing to talk to him, and listen to him. This was extraordinary for him. It\u2019s very hard to explain this to people who don\u2019t know Europe. You know, who don\u2019t know what a provincial Austrian is, or Hungarian. It\u2019s very much the same. And I think that this weighed as heavily finally, as anythi --"

It\u2019s extraordinary, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m horrified at the number of terrible childhoods there are.

But of course it\u2019s too simple. You can never simplify somebody like Stangl, you can say -- I can say here is just a provincial Austrian. Of course he was just a convincial -- provincial Austrian. But he was a provincial Austrian who went through a series of experiences which burned itself into his spirit, and corrupted him totally. He was a totally corrupt man. A man who should never have been allowed again into the presence of children. Which is what his wife felt, eventually, you know? I mean -- and -- and I\u2019m not even saying that -- you know, I\u2019m not even saying that you can blame only Stangl for this. You have to blame -- you have to blame the whole -- the circumstances, and the environment. So the people who created this environment, are of course as blameworthy as Stangl. Do you see what I mean? I mean, of course Stangl, had he had the right help from his wife, he could have got out of it. But it would have been difficult, and demanded, you know, character. I mean, the kind of character he didn\u2019t have. I mean the kind of civic courage that he didn\u2019t have, and also some conviction of sorts that he didn\u2019t have. For instance, the conviction that no one person, because he was Jewish, is bad, rather than another person is good. I mean, it -- it simply -- thi -- thi -- this is -- the moment this division exists in the person, where to him, you know, where a Russian 1s bad, and an Englishman is good -- I mean, this is total bullshit of course, total nonsense. And the moment you feel anything like that, which is one of the dangers of war by the way, you\u2019re lost."

This is very dangerous for anyone\u2019s character. It\u2019s very bad for you. And I was lucky enough that, you know, I had this wonderful family at home. I had the counterweight of my extremely intelligent husband, and you know, very intelligent children. So not -- I\u2019m saying intelligent because you know, you feel that you are so much in command, that your brain is more in your mind than anything else. I mean, there were moments when I -- I -- I knew I couldn\u2019t go on, and I then could go on, because that\u2019s what I did. But -- but it was very different, of course, when I undertook this thing with sha -- with Speer. Because Speer was not just my equal, but he was way superior to me in intellect. He was far more cultiv\u00e9 than -- than I was at the time, you know. He had read far more. He -- he -- he was a -- an absolutely extraordinary man, and so it -- it was a completely different challenge."

            "answer": "Well, Speer -- Speer, whom I didn\u2019t like when he -- when h-he -- Speer asked me to do this. I mean, he got in touch with me having read, \u201cInto That Darkness.\u201d And obviously -- I mean, as I said before, these people want to speak, they want to talk. And Speer read, \u201cInto That Darkness,\u201d which kept him sleepless, he said, for several nights. And -- and he decided that this was somebody he could talk to. Now Speer had talked to a lot of people, you know, because he was, of course, a huge personality, of enormous importance historically. And I suppose every major journalist in the world -- certainly in the western world, tried to talk to Speer. I mean, it would have been insane not to. I didn\u2019t like him. I saw him on TV, I -- you know, I read -- of course I read his books. I thought he was an arrogant man. His charm did not charm me. I thought his -- he was very suave, and I couldn\u2019t bear it. So when he -- when he wrote to me, and then followed this up with quite a lot of phone calls, I was -- I was very reluctant indeed. He became -- he became very atta -- not attached, that\u2019s the wrong word, but he -- he liked my husband very much, already on the telephone. I mean, they had these long conversations on art, about which Speer knew, I mean far more than either of us, of course. But also, Don knows far more than I, but Speer knew far, far more than -- and -- and it was quite interesting for my husband, you know, who was still very actively on \u201cVogue,\u201d and doing lots of photography, also to do with artists and so on. So it was all very interesting for him."

            "answer": "But somehow a kind of relationship developed, and when there had been, you know, something -- I don\u2019t know how many weeks it was, it was several weeks of these phone calls which came in from Speer, all asking me, well when would I come to Heidelberg, and I mean wasn\u2019t I planning? I was so often in Germany, wasn\u2019t I -- blah, blah, blah, blah. And finally I thought, what is the matter with me? I mean, if th -- this man is so desperate for me to do a Stangl on him, okay. I'll do it. You know, as vulgarly as that, I thought. And of course that kind of thought immediately disappeared the moment I met him. I\u2019ve got to say, I mean really. I mean, we were -- we went to have lunch with him and his wife in a Heidelberg [indecipherable], and there was this humble man. On the telephone he was just as arrogant as on TV. So every tra - telephone call supported my -- exta -- not every, some of them there was this curious humility. Anyway, at lunch, I mean, you know, there was a different man. And I thought, well wait a minute, maybe I\u2019m all wrong about this. What is this man, you know? What is this? And of course, he talked a lot during a long, long lunch. And talked a lot about it, about Hitler, which is what I encouraged him to do. And by the end of the lunch, and Don and I went back to our hotel, I said, \u201cJesus, of course the one thing that in all these weeks I didn\u2019t think about, was that this man was the closest to Hitler of anyone in Germany. Am I crazy not to want to talk to him?\u201d Don said, \u201cOh yes, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d So -- so anyway, that\u2019s how it started, you know, and of course the moment I started talking to him, I -- one\u2019s attitude changes. Once -- as I told you, once- once people start talking about their childhood, and with me they always have to talk about their childhood first, because I think everything starts in childhood. I know that this is a -- a clich\u00e9 thing to say, and Freudian and all the rest of it, but it\u2019s not Freudian, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s purely human. It doesn\u2019t apply to everybody either, I have to say. Because you can have a rotten childhood, or a difficult childhood, and still become a perfectly ordinary and good person. So it doesn\u2019t apply to everybody, but somebody who then develops in a certain way, and has had a terrible childhood, then you can find -- you know, you can find connections. And certainly with Speer there were very, very strong connections. He was extraordinary lonely as a child. I mean, the middle child of three, and neither liked by his father, nor by his mother, who liked the two at the other -- one each, you know, of the other brothers. He was very alone throughout his childhood. And -- and -- an-and really suffered under it, I mean, he -- he suffer -- he had a -- he had a suffering childhood, Speer, which is odd. So when he found Hitler, of course 1t must have been the most extraordinary experience. And when Hitler found Speer it must have been the extraordinary experience, because, you know, if you want to make it very simple -- and why not make it simple, then a man who had never been a father, found a son. And a son who had never had a father, found a father. It\u2019s as simple as that, really, except it\u2019s much more complicated. But start with the simple things, and you find answers. Because certainly Speer and Hitler loved each other. They loved each other. And it took Speer -- it took Speer all those years to understand, partly, that there was something terribly wrong. And he never, never understood it really, until he was in Spandau, and was alone, and could read. You know, he read 5,000 books in Spandau. And boy, he could read, you know. And he c -- he -- by the time I met him, he knew -- boy, he knew more than anybody else did. He really did. I think he knew more about the Nazis -- of course, knew more about Hitler than everybody else did, but he understood more than anybody else did. And as for this one part of this Nazism, which everybody, of course, as you -- as you know, I think, is exclusively concerned with, Speer was never an ideological anti-Semite. He was an anti-Semite because they were all anti-Semites. But he was not an ideological anti-Semite. He could manage with anybody, actually. And he could manage, of course after -- I mean, after Spandau, I mean my God, I mean in Spandau he -- you know, in Spandau he had a -- a great deal to do with -- with Jewish officers, and actually had -- I mean, he even emotionally changed a lot there. You see, it was a -- it was a tremendous opening of understanding of what people were, you know. People, that it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s not where they come from, it -- but what they are. Which is the only thing that counts. I mean, it doesn\u2019t matter where anybody comes from, what religion, or what they like to call race. I mean, this ridiculous and dreadful word, race. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s totally unimportant, the only thing that matters is what the individual is, with a capital I. And that\u2019s what Speer -- what Speer certainly learned in Spandau. So you know by the time -- by the time he came to me, I mean he was really preconditioned to really talking. And he did, I mean he -- he- Speer t-taught me more than I could ever give him. He would have hated this book, of course, absolutely hated it. He was very, you know, he was very, very dubious about what I would write. And he was so right."

But people like Speer- and I won\u2019t say people like I, because I don\u2019t mean to compare myself to Speer, but -- but -- but people of some, if you like, some intellect, or some -- they are not protected by this. They need it just as much, or it happens just as much. And certainly Speer -- I mean there were days when he -- when he obviously had had some experience with jailers, or whatever, I don\u2019t know, when he -- when it was really very difficult to get him to go on. But on the whole, he was completely different, of course, from Stangl, I mean obviously. But he was looking forward to these conversations."

And he never said that, but I know this, I know this. He was desperate about it. The only mistake was -- and I could never, never -- I could never persuade him of this, that he too felt that that was the only thing he needed to feel guilty about. And when I said to him, and I did of course, not once, but oh, how many times, you brought the forced laborers to Germany, you are responsible for the death of a hundred thousand of them. This was your work, not Sowers, who was hanged for it. He was under your orders, it was yours. It simply didn\u2019t touch him, it was like -- as if I didn\u2019t say anything. I might as well have kept my mouth shut. He felt no guilt for this. This was part of his - | won\u2019t call it duty, but it was -- it was simply part of what he was there for. And as far as he was concerned, of course -- and this is true, I mean, of course I checked all this. When he found out that foreign laborers -- I mean, fo -- he called them Gastarbeiter, but hell, they weren\u2019t Gastarbeiter. When fo -- foreign laborers were mistreated anywhere, if he found out, he took measures. He did. And -- and you know, he mentioned a number of occasions to me. Every occasion that I could look into, I did. Every single one of them was confirmed. He took steps, it was changed, the people were properly treated, they were moved into different places where they were properly treat -- or whatever. So, he did. Even so, the system, it is the system, and he agreed to the system, and he supported it, and he was Hitler\u2019s closest friend, and he was responsible for God\u2019s sake. He was responsible, he was responsible for their deaths. But he knew it, you see, and he was -- he was the unhappiest man of all the Nazis I met. He was the most important, and he was the unhappiest."
