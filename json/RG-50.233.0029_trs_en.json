            "answer": "Well, when I was born there I was about three months old and my parents moved to Vienna, Austria. In Vienna, Austria I went to schooling and my father went to the military and it was a very rough time, the same time what we have now in the United States. And so actually after the school, I had five years elementary school, three years high school, after that I had to find me a job so I couldn\u2019t find something so my mother went with me to , Vienna. And we find in a linoleum business they had a sign out there \u201capprenticeship\u201d. So in we went into the apprenticeship business there until we find out that the name of that manager was Lisplau, which was actually somehow related.. It was a coincidence. Anyhow I started my apprenticeship as a salesman. That was for three years, a guarantee of a half year, a guarantee as a salesman. After my apprenticeship when the salesmanship was to end, they released me and that was the end of that business. My mother said I don\u2019t want you to stay around in Austria, why don\u2019t we go out of Vienna. So, which would still be Austria; naturally. So we went out of Vienna, we went to a train and we just picked one town. And in that town my mother said O.K. Now you can see how good you are as a salesman. So, I had a special deal with a fabric of linoleum, I had a special deal and so I made some sales in that town. Later on it was not good that way so we went to the city of  , 1n upper Austria."

            "answer": "It was very good. The business was very good but so what actually happened in 1938 when Hitler came one day in April, a gendarme came to my house and said --I was actually been a landlady. I rented the place and she came there and they asked for me and she said, John, I know him. He was not a friend. I know that gentile. In a town like that you know everybody. So he asked me first, he said; my name was Hans actually, you know. So he said I come for you I have to arrest you. I said why? He said are you Jewish? I said yes. Can you tell me that you are not Jewish? I cannot tell you that I said. So he said, O.K. I have to arrest you, we\u2019re going to go to the railroad station and I am not going to put a handcuff on you. I have to take you to Linz, in Austria. So, that\u2019s the way it was. We went to the railroad station, came to Linz and in Linz he put on the handcuffs and he had actually the order from the Gestapo, So we went to the jail there, this was a normal procedure at that time they put all the Jews in that place and we just waited for several days. Then they told us it would be better if you Jews would get ready in the morning, he said, we\u2019re going to go to the railroad station. O.K. so all the Jewish people that were there, we\u2019re lining up, we went outside, we went to the station, we waited a long time until the train came in, then when the train came in, all the SS came out from the train there to the station. They put a line so we cannot escape, we had to go through that line to the cars. What happened then, we had to, the first time I see somebody was going there, the SS trooper the rifles upside down tried to hit anybody who was walking there .so that was already a little punishment. Well, when I saw that I run right through that thing, they couldn\u2019t hit me at all. So anyhow, we went in the cars, the trash, and all the windows were blocked, you couldn\u2019t see where you were going, it was  3 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They put the lights in the compartments. About 10 people in each compartment and they put on the light and they put the light extra strong on. I don\u2019t know how they did it. Anyhow, they said everybody has to look up in the light. Don\u2019t put your hat on. If you put your hat on you get something coming. So everybody was looking, some people just couldn\u2019t keep their head up in the light. You almost get blind when you were looking. You had to keep the eyes open. If you close the eyes they hit you, you know. So you couldn\u2019t do that so you have to look up there. Anyhow, after about two hours they quit that business, but we couldn\u2019t go to the bathroom. Some people had, we were driving the next day in the morning, some people had to go to the restroom, but there was no restroom."

So then in the morning after about nine, ten o\u2019clock, it was in the morning we find out we came to and that time, I never was there before, and so they took us out there and put us in cattle cars. They put us in cattle cars and made it real crowded in there so there was no place to move around. Either they want to save the cars, not have too many cars. Whatever it was, it was a cruelty thing. We still couldn\u2019t go to the bathroom, some people had to clear out one corner in the cattle cars and we let them all go in that one corner and after then we stopped at a station. The station which we didn\u2019t know the station, I don\u2019t think so, somebody knows ,we didn\u2019t know at that time where we was. We went out of the station, we were allowed in the restrooms at that time and we find out this was Dachau."

Everybody has to fill it themselves. And they had a bathroom there. It was everything new. It was for us, it doesn\u2019t look too bad, it didn\u2019t look at that time like, we didn\u2019t know what it was. We saw something it was built. So they took us a whole bunch of the old Jews together there. There was not too many at that time there and they brought up to a place where they have in the street some rocks. A pile of rocks lay. So the SS man said everybody take one rock and march that way. O.K. so everybody took one rock, some were small, some were big and we took the rock, 1t was not very heavy, we went to the bathroom about a mile and then they said O.K., now put the rocks on that place and make a pile.

We had our yellow star, the criminals had their green star, the homosexuals had an orange star, you know, and so on. Everybody had a different star. That was the way they were identified. Anyhow, there wasn\u2019t very much to do to us. We had an SS man and the SS man said, O.K. The SS man took us behind the barracks, he make us some kind of contest of running. He built two columns, one of the columns was A one of the columns was B and we had to see which column can run faster the distance which he is giving us. That was actually the business at the end. Then we were all finished, then he teached us some songs, we had to run around. It was all no punishment there, it was just a concentration camp in the build-up. And all night we all had stars on the jacket. There was a canteen, in this canteen we still could buy something if somebody had money. So some of the people, we went down, we buy something then they discontinued that, we couldn\u2019t do anymore and I had a bright new jacket, I didn\u2019t have my star on it yet, so the people said, well you have a brand new jacket you can go in the canteen for us to buy something. So I went for them. I took the chance and bought something for them. That went up to July 1938."

In these trucks we were all stuffed in there, they had no backing on these trucks, you know, no gates. So we were standing in there, there was not very much to hold, one was holding onto the other. So, we went to another camp, which we discovered was . That was in July. So we came to Buchenwald which was a very bad situation. When we came we were hot we were hungry, they gave us a loaf of bread. We thought, oh, this 1s good so we find out in the evening that the loaf of bread has to last until the next morning. And in the evening, in the morning you get the bread, in the evening you get a soup, whatever you call it. And so that was the procedure. So in the morning always you got the bread, in the evening you get the soup. In the evening you had no bread. So it was a very bad situation. You had nothing to eat. It was not a big loaf of bread, it was a small bread. So, I was a good feeder that time, not too bad. Most of the people which came from Dachau was not too bad a shape.

Further on we went to work so he gave me a pick and somebody got a shovel and we had to dig the ground there.. We didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on anyhow. Anyway that\u2019s the way they kept us busy there. So, one day, a guy said to me, he said, why you\u2019re working too hard, why don\u2019t you take the shovel and give that other one the pick? It didn\u2019t work out either because these people were not trained to have some, what you call it, equipment in the hand. I was coming from the country so I was a little tougher than they were. You get some blisters. So the next day, one day in the morning, a guy said to me, hey, come over to our command, we have a good commander. O.K. so I was shifting over, which was not allowed but I did it, I went to the other commander, the commander was a criminal. He had a green star. And he said hurry up, he had about 375 people there in his command. Every two people get a platform of wood, about 3x4, you know, and has two handles in the back, two handles in the front, and one man in the back and one man in the front carry the platform. The platform we had to put sand on it at that time and with that we marched a mile or two miles, whatever it was in the time, and when we came there with the sand we dropped the sand there, we took some stones, we took it back to the other place.

Don\u2019t worry. I said what about the license. She said don\u2019t worry, they aren\u2019t so strict here, you are a good driver.
