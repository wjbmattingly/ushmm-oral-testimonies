            "answer": "Well, when I was born there I was about three months old and my parents moved to Vienna, Austria. In Vienna, Austria I went to schooling and my father went to the military and it was a very rough time, the same time what we have now in the United States. And so actually after the school, I had five years elementary school, three years high school, after that I had to find me a job so I couldn\u2019t find something so my mother went with me to , Vienna. And we find in a linoleum business they had a sign out there \u201capprenticeship\u201d. So in we went into the apprenticeship business there until we find out that the name of that manager was Lisplau, which was actually somehow related.. It was a coincidence. Anyhow I started my apprenticeship as a salesman. That was for three years, a guarantee of a half year, a guarantee as a salesman. After my apprenticeship when the salesmanship was to end, they released me and that was the end of that business. My mother said I don\u2019t want you to stay around in Austria, why don\u2019t we go out of Vienna. So, which would still be Austria; naturally. So we went out of Vienna, we went to a train and we just picked one town. And in that town my mother said O.K. Now you can see how good you are as a salesman. So, I had a special deal with a fabric of linoleum, I had a special deal and so I made some sales in that town. Later on it was not good that way so we went to the city of , 1n upper Austria."

            "question": "How was the business, was it a good business for you, the linoleum, in the town?",
            "answer": "It was very good. The business was very good but so what actually happened in 1938 when Hitler came one day in April, a gendarme came to my house and said --I was actually been a landlady. I rented the place and she came there and they asked for me and she said, John, I know him. He was not a friend. I know that gentile. In a town like that you know everybody. So he asked me first, he said; my name was Hans actually, you know. So he said I come for you I have to arrest you. I said why? He said are you Jewish? I said yes. Can you tell me that you are not Jewish? I cannot tell you that I said. So he said, O.K. I have to arrest you, we\u2019re going to go to the railroad station and I am not going to put a handcuff on you. I have to take you to Linz, in Austria. So, that\u2019s the way it was. We went to the railroad station, came to Linz and in Linz he put on the handcuffs and he had actually the order from the Gestapo, So we went to the jail there, this was a normal procedure at that time they put all the Jews in that place and we just waited for several days. Then they told us it would be better if you Jews would get ready in the morning, he said, we\u2019re going to go to the railroad station. O.K. so all the Jewish people that were there, we\u2019re lining up, we went outside, we went to the station, we waited a long time until the train came in, then when the train came in, all the SS came out from the train there to the station. They put a line so we cannot escape, we had to go through that line to the cars. What happened then, we had to, the first time I see somebody was going there, the SS trooper the rifles upside down tried to hit anybody who was walking there .so that was already a little punishment. Well, when I saw that I run right through that thing, they couldn\u2019t hit me at all. So anyhow, we went in the cars, the trash, and all the windows were blocked, you couldn\u2019t see where you were going, it was 3 dark outside. They put the lights in the compartments. About 10 people in each compartment and they put on the light and they put the light extra strong on. I don\u2019t know how they did it. Anyhow, they said everybody has to look up in the light. Don\u2019t put your hat on. If you put your hat on you get something coming. So everybody was looking, some people just couldn\u2019t keep their head up in the light. You almost get blind when you were looking. You had to keep the eyes open. If you close the eyes they hit you, you know. So you couldn\u2019t do that so you have to look up there. Anyhow, after about two hours they quit that business, but we couldn\u2019t go to the bathroom. Some people had, we were driving the next day in the morning, some people had to go to the restroom, but there was no restroom."

So then in the morning after about nine, ten o\u2019clock, it was in the morning we find out we came to and that time, I never was there before, and so they took us out there and put us in cattle cars. They put us in cattle cars and made it real crowded in there so there was no place to move around. Either they want to save the cars, not have too many cars. Whatever it was, it was a cruelty thing. We still couldn\u2019t go to the bathroom, some people had to clear out one corner in the cattle cars and we let them all go in that one corner and after then we stopped at a station. The station which we didn\u2019t know the station, I don\u2019t think so, somebody knows ,we didn\u2019t know at that time where we was. We went out of the station, we were allowed in the restrooms at that time and we find out this was Dachau."

Everybody has to fill it themselves. And they had a bathroom there. It was everything new. It was for us, it doesn\u2019t look too bad, it didn\u2019t look at that time like, we didn\u2019t know what it was. We saw something it was built. So they took us a whole bunch of the old Jews together there. There was not too many at that time there and they brought up to a place where they have in the street some rocks. A pile of rocks lay. So the SS man said everybody take one rock and march that way. O.K. so everybody took one rock, some were small, some were big and we took the rock, 1t was not very heavy, we went to the bathroom about a mile and then they said O.K., now put the rocks on that place and make a pile. So 4 we put the rocks on that, we go to another pile, pick up another rock and put it on the pile. They had nothing to do for us."

We had our yellow star, the criminals had their green star, the homosexuals had an orange star, you know, and so on. Everybody had a different star. That was the way they were identified. Anyhow, there wasn\u2019t very much to do to us. We had an SS man and the SS man said, O.K. The SS man took us behind the barracks, he make us some kind of contest of running. He built two columns, one of the columns was A one of the columns was B and we had to see which column can run faster the distance which he is giving us. That was actually the business at the end. Then we were all finished, then he teached us some songs, we had to run around. It was all no punishment there, it was just a concentration camp in the build-up. And all night we all had stars on the jacket. There was a canteen, in this canteen we still could buy something if somebody had money. So some of the people, we went down, we buy something then they discontinued that, we couldn\u2019t do anymore and I had a bright new jacket, I didn\u2019t have my star on it yet, so the people said, well you have a brand new jacket you can go in the canteen for us to buy something. So I went for them. I took the chance and bought something for them. That went up to July 1938."

            "question": "A regular train car with seats and everything?",
            "answer": "Yes, a regular train car, but 1t was very strict in there, the SS were hitting us. You were not allowed to speak, you were not allowed to move your head. One of the SS men when I just look at somebody else and turned my head, he hit me with the upside down pistol right on my head. That came certainly after three hours\u2019 train ride. The commandos came and said, don\u2019t hit anybody anymore. Hitting I not allowed. So, O.K. that went all the way until we came to Reimar, the city of Reimar. So after we came on the station, everybody had to run out there, we were 5 not allowed to walk out and outside after the railroad station there was already trucks waiting for us. In these trucks we were all stuffed in there, they had no backing on these trucks, you know, no gates. So we were standing in there, there was not very much to hold, one was holding onto the other. So, we went to another camp, which we discovered was . That was in July. So we came to Buchenwald which was a very bad situation. When we came we were hot we were hungry, they gave us a loaf of bread. We thought, oh, this 1s good so we find out in the evening that the loaf of bread has to last until the next morning. And in the evening, in the morning you get the bread, in the evening you get a soup, whatever you call it. And so that was the procedure. So in the morning always you got the bread, in the evening you get the soup. In the evening you had no bread. So it was a very bad situation. You had nothing to eat. It was not a big loaf of bread, it was a small bread. So, I was a good feeder that time, not too bad. Most of the people which came from Dachau was not too bad a shape. But over there we got in a bad shape because it was a lousy situation."

So he was not very much for the Nazis anyhow but he said he gave us some warnings, and in the morning he said you people going out and right in front of the barracks he had a latrine build, which was just trenches in a big hole and that was the latrine. Further on we went to work so he gave me a pick and somebody got a shovel and we had to dig the ground there.. We didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on anyhow. Anyway that\u2019s the way they kept us busy there. So, one day, a guy said to me, he said, why you\u2019re working too hard, why don\u2019t you take the shovel and give that other one the pick? It didn\u2019t work out either because these people were not trained to have some, what you call it, equipment in the hand. I was coming from the country so I was a little tougher than they were. You get some blisters. So the next day, one day in the morning, a guy said to me, hey, come over to our command, we have a good commander. O.K. so I was shifting over, which was not allowed but I did it, I went to the other commander, the commander was a criminal. He had a green star. And he said hurry up, he had about 375 people there in his command. Every two people get a platform of wood, about 3x4, you know, and has two handles in the back, two handles in the front, and one man in the back and one man in the front carry the platform. The platform we had to put sand on it at that time and with that we marched a mile or two miles, whatever it was in the time, and when we came there with the sand we dropped the sand there, we took some stones, we took it back to the other place. On the way over there we were passing on the places there were some trees there. One day we came there was three people hanging there. There was three hanging there."

What actually happened, on the 13\" of October in the night was the Apell, you know, they put everybody on a big place. All the blocks together, and certainly they called my name. When they called my name they said tomorrow morning you have to go for a medical. So I heard it, I didn\u2019t 8 know what\u2019s going to happen, I had nothing wrong with me. So I came to my block and they said. Oh, you\u2019re going out, you\u2019re going out. You\u2019re going for a medical, you\u2019re going out he said. But do not tell him that you heard something. Don\u2019t tell him nothing. Tell him you feel fine, tell him you\u2019re O.K. you feel wonderful. Tell him whatever you want but don\u2019t tell you got something wrong with you. So the next day in the morning I went to the medical I did like the block, like the guy told me to do it and he said O.K. you go in the next room over there we going to supply you with some clothes. We haven\u2019t got your clothes from Dachau but we have to give you some other clothes there are. So, they supplied me and the next day in the morning, on the 15\" I was going on a transport, I was going on transport, on the way to Linz, Austria. That transport took about 14 days, 15 days."

And we go from one town, next town we went out, they put us 1n the jail, they gave us a breakfast, they put us back there, we continued. Then there was the next town. So we went about at least twelve, or ten or twelve towns before I came to Linz, Austria. I came to Linz, Austria on the evening of November 5, 1938. I arrived there. When I arrived there it was, like I said, criminal police came to me and said John Friedmann, are you hungry? I said sure. So he said today we have a special day, we have a herring and I give you a double issue because you went that long way. So he give me that was it. So he said to me, what are you going to do if I going to let you out of here? I said, what am I going to do, I\u2019m going to see if I can get out of Austria as fast as Ican. So the man said, that\u2019s all I want to do here. The next day in the next morning, at 7 o\u2019clock in the morning, he said, O.K. John, go ahead get out of Austria he said. So he released me. I didn\u2019t have any money to go back to my town, so I went to the Jewish organization in Linz and I said I need some money to get on the train. He said we don\u2019t have very much money, but for the train he said, we give you that. So they give me the money, two gildas to go from Linz to , where I meet my landlady, where she had my money, some of my money there, so I was all right. So after about on the 7\u201d, I went to Vienna. When I went to Vienna in 1938, so here comes actually the story of the Kristallnacht. Every time I have to report to the police department, and to go up there.. So the first time I go up to the police, the man said to me, where are you, where have you been? We waiting for you such a long time, we get the report 9 you\u2019re going to come, but we didn\u2019t receive you. We going to keep you here. We cannot let you go. We going to check out what you have to tell us and we cannot let you go. My mother went with me. She went right away to get some food out there, to buy some food. The man was going on the phone and it took about two hours my mother came back after and after about two hours they called me in the room and said well, we find out that everything you said is correct, you can go home. So my mother said, O.K. now we have to eat the food at home. That was about on the 8\", on the 8\"\" of November they told me every second day I have to come there. I don\u2019t have to come every day. So on the next day, the morning, I went out, I said to my mother well, I better go back to my town, get all my things over there what I have left, come back to you then. So, that was on the 9\" of November. I didn\u2019t see very much of the Kristallnacht actually, but I was there. So I was there, coincidentally, I took a train, it was 9:30 in the evening, went down to my town. It was an overnight train, you see, when you took the train there in the morning at 6 o\u2019clock, it arrived in . So it went all the night. So I came to my landlady in the morning then and she said, oh, I\u2019m glad to see you. I said, what\u2019s wrong? She said yesterday, it was the 9\", a gendarme came and asked for you. I told him you are not here, you are in Vienna by your mother. So, that\u2019s the way I get out of the Kristallnacht. "

If they are good overhauls, you know. So there was an engineer, his name was , he was a Jewish fellow, so he got me there as his assistant.

The ghetto was a district across the bridge of the Yangtze River, called . And that ghetto there, there was really about maybe 100,000, 200,000 Chinese. All living there. So they put us in there.

They had an order from the Japanese to build hundreds of motors which they put in suicide boats. Boats that go against enemies, naturally. And these boats were built without a clutch. It was straight hooked up to the propeller. So when you start the motor, the boat was shooting already. Only have to get the direction that it supposed to run in the boat. That was in France, then, like I said, I got the job in the Toyota Company, which helped me get a pass out of , out of the ghetto. So I was going out of the ghetto at the time when, because as a mechanic, there were not very many mechanics. There was only six, seven mechanics. SIDE TWO ",
                " (Something is missing). Jewish Young fellows, I hired them as apprentices, I have the authority from them, which are still in America here. So after Toyota closed up in downtown L.A., of Los Angeles, it was in the French section, Dickie said we have to go with the bus the next day and the Nissan Company takes over. That was the Datsun Company. Nisson/Datsun Company they call it in Japanese. So they hired us, O.K., so what was the hiring, every half month they give us a bag of rice and they give a little bit of pocket money. So it was better than nothing. My mother was still there. It worked out all right. It was not great, but when you are able to work in your profession, it was good. So, anyhow that was going on until the American came in. "

That did not last too long and finally I get a job in Nanking. In Nanking for the American to build a radio station. XMHA Radio Station in Nanking. At that time the headquarters of General Marshall. I went over there and my mother stayed in Shanghai. I was employed as a power man, I had to make the power for the radio station that they can run the transmitters. They didn\u2019t have enough people so I was running the power and then I was helping the radio stations to build, before 14 the radio station was open, I helped put the towers up, about 45 foot towers over top of General Marshall\u2019s building there, and General Marshall was on the first floor and the second floor. I was on the third floor over there. They gave us the lodging in the Headquarters and it was working all right for that part. Then I always had a job, I never was without a job. Always had a job. That went to 1949. 1949 we heard that the communists are coming across the Yangtze already, we had to get out of Shanghai. So the Jewish organizations told us, it was a very short notice from one day to the other, tomorrow, at 10 o\u2019clock assemble all the organizations and we are going to Canada. So we I just took an army bag and I put everything what I could. Money I couldn\u2019t take, they didn\u2019t let you take money out of there, so whatever it was we went the next day in the morning with Alaskan Airlines out of Shanghai. When we crossed the river they were shooting already at the airlines, at the transportation here, then we came to Fairbanks, Alaska. Fairbanks, Alaska and there we get a transfer plane after we waited a day over. We went on a transfer plane to Seattle. We came to Seattle, it was not allowed that we can get off the bus because we didn\u2019t have any documents, so they took us in the bus then, they were running the buses to Vancouver, from Seattle to Vancouver. In Vancouver, already some of the Jewish people there who were working for the organization, they were waiting for us already. I found a lady there, she was Mrs. Gould and she said, oh, you are a mechanic. I said yes. She said why don\u2019t you drive, I don\u2019t like to drive that car. So, she was sitting next to me, we went all around Vancouver. I was driving the car. The next day she said, you just can drive, if you want a car, drive through the ton you can have the car. Don\u2019t worry. I said what about the license. She said don\u2019t worry, they aren\u2019t so strict here, you are a good driver. So we stayed three days in Vancouver after the three days, we were going on a train, we went to Toronto, Canada. Now we came to Toronto, Canada the 29\" of May 1949, and right away they gave us some quarters, we didn\u2019t have any money, they paid for the first two weeks until we get some money made there, until we get some employment. I got right away employed for the Austin of England. So right away I got Austin of England employed and well, that was the beginning Canada, then when I was working there I met my wife, we got married in Canada and in 1950.
