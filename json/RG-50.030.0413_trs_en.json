And my father, for in-- to give you an example, was very friendly with the township judge. But being friendly with the township judge did not mean that the township judge invited my father for dinner, or my father invited the judge for dinner. But they were very, very friendly, you know, and th -- my father was very respected.

And there were those that did it. So one day we found out that an Ukrainian from a village, Potanachufka, delivered to the Gestapo a mother and a daughter, that\u2019s a young girl eight years, or nine year old. And of course the Gestapo took them and killed them. So we went- went in that night to the village, knocked at the door, took him out, slung him up on a tree in the front of his house, as a sign, this will be the reward for anybody who will turn Jews over to the Gestapo for a liter of vodka or five pounds of sugar.

It was very cold, and as a person moved his bowels, it froze. And -- let me finish the story. And so it kept on, you know, freezing, and normally when -- you know, when you move your bowels, and if you have a hard surface, it creates like an ice cream cone, a reversed ice cream cone. So this kept growing, and growing, and growing until it reached the level of the plank. And one of the guys got up at night, you know, no one wanted to go out at night, but when you couldn\u2019t hold it any more, so -- and he ran out, and sat down on that plank, you know, to do -- to move his bowels. But as he sat down, that frozen point of the accumulated bowel movement penetrated his buttock, and he was bleeding. Until today, he is known as the partisan who was injured by a pile of shit."

And in Lublin, this was the time where the first Polish government was forming. You know, if you -- you ro -- you remember, the Poles divided up in Russia into two, it was an [indecipherable] army that went through Teheran, Israel, you know, and they stayed and fought on the side of the allies, and there was the -- the -- I have a -- a blank mind on the name of ma -- th -- the women. There was a Polish unit, a Polish army that fought -- decided to come into Poland, to liberate Poland with the Soviet army, and help establish a -- Vonda Rosherefska, it was her name -- and to help establish a new Polish regime, a Socialist regime, so to say. So Lublin became a very viable place, and -- and since in particular this was a time when people came back from every camp, from every corner, you know, and they were looking to find out whether someone 1s alive or not. So it became a very viable Jewish center. And I wanted to be there, hoping that maybe I\u2019ll find something out about my sister, about her children. About Mother I didn\u2019t have much hope, because I -- you know, I didn\u2019t think even if she wouldn\u2019t been killed, that she would have survived these horrors. And I settled myself in, I got an apartment, and -- and I needed to make a living, so I got into partnership with Leon Fellheldner.

And one night -- he was not active in any politics or anything, one night Polish extremists entered the house where he was, and killed him. Now, there were many killings after the war, you know that. But this killing was so painful in particular for the role that he has played. Here is a man, the son of a rabbi, who was able to enter a role of leadership in uprising, in rebellion, and revenge in a death camp. And to come out of it, and then be killed when he was hoping to start building his own life, a new life, very painful, very bitter.
