So, and this lady, I told her all I wanted was to show my kids where my mother lived, where my fath er lived, you know, and I give her a few dollars, so she spoke already different, you know. In fact, to be honest with you, before we left the first time, you know, we had candle sticks, some silver. We didn\u2122t want to take it in Warsaw ghetto and they showed me where they buried it. But I saw the Poles, I didn\u2122t want them to risk myself to go take a look. They\u2122re probably not, but I didn\u2122t want to. So, anyway, we went to Grodzisk. Showed them where we lived. Showed them where my grandfather lived, where I went to school. Oh, I made a lot of pictures, too, you know it. And then we went back to Warsaw. Next day we went to Piotrk\u00f3w, you know it. And same thing, I showed them where the ghetto, and where we were. One thing what I couldn\u2122t bring myself in, to go in this room where my parents and my grandparents went out the last time. I told my kids, I can\u2122t go in, you know, somehow I couldn\u2122t. So anyway, so we went there and we went back to Warsaw. And then we went to Treblinka, this is on the other side from Warsaw. And then we stayed there and then we went back to Germany. Went to Buchenwald, where I was liberated. And so we made our way home. At least I showed the kids, that we still lived, we had an apartmen t. Really it was our house. You know, we were still something. No doubt that we didn\u2122t come out from a rock. (Laughing.)
