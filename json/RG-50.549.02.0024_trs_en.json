This is an interview with Susie Schwarz, conducted by Margaret West, on September the 24th, 1998, in Highland, Maryland. This is a follow up interview to a USHMM videotaped interview conducted with Susie Schwarz on February the 14th, 1990. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A.",
            "answer": "I\u2019m Susie Schwarz. I was born in Germany, on May the third, 1931 in a little town called Schlichtern, which is near the city of Frankfort, Germany. My father\u2019s name was Max Greenbaum -- or Greenbaum and he was born in November of 1897, also in Schlichtern. My mother\u2019s maiden name was Kaita Kahn and she came from what is now called Badbuchau, in southern Germany. Her birthdate is December eight, 1903 and for the record, she is still living and well in Baltimore, Maryland. She married my father in March of 1930, after a whirlwind courtship and moved with him to Schlichtern and lived there together with his family, his mother and several siblings. My father, as a trade, worked as a horse -- or was a horse dealer. They sold -- bought and sold horses and sold them mostly to farmers, I believe, and seemed to have made a very good living, because they lived very comfortably there in Schlichtern, as I was told. However, in 1933, he felt that the political situation was such that he was no longer comfortable staying in Germany. He was worried that things would go from bad to worse and decided to go to England. I was told that he left in search of new opportunities and went to -- through the Netherlands to go to England. However, he stopped in a little town in Holland called Dinksburlow and there he was -- he was given a contact with a family by the name of Pagrach, P-a-g-r-a-c-h. And when he told them that he was going to go to German -- to -- sorry -- to England, they said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here? In the Netherlands, you will be very safe, and they do need a horse dealer here. There are lots of farmers who are always in need of new horses. And also, there are some people that are interested in riding horses.\u201d Well, it appears that he allowed himself to be dissuaded from going to England, and remained. And obviously sent, shortly thereafter, for my mother and me. I, at that time, was two years old. So, the two of us came to Holland and my recollections obviously are not too clear. With regard to my parents beliefs and opinions, I have a feeling that my mother in particular, felt German first, Jewish second. I think my father may have been a little bit more neutral in that area. By the way, my mother came from a fairly Orthodox family. Her father went to synagogue a lot and I don\u2019t know if they had a really, strictly kosher home, but they were fairly observant. My father\u2019s family, however, was not. I don\u2019t think they were either very religious or very much associated with a synagogue or community, as such. I think they were more interested in their business and my grandfather, incidentally, also was in the same line of business -- my paternal grandfather. And interestingly, my mother\u2019s father was a cattle dealer, slash, farmer. I am not too sure how politically active or conscious they were, other than the threat of Nazism. But, other than that, I don\u2019t think they were involved in any party or political organizations. My father did serve in the German army in the first World War. I do not know in what capacity, but he was a soldier, I don\u2019t know what rank he ever -- if any, he achieved. In any case, my mother\u2019s family, just to complete the picture, consisted of her parents, a brother -- an older brother and sister, who incidentally, went to Israel in \u201837 or \u201838. The mother, having been left behind for good reasons, because they wanted to establish themselves first in Israel, and therefore, the mother remained in Buchau -- Badbuchau. My father\u2019s family consisted of three brothers, two sisters and of course, my father. All of the former went to the United States also, in -- I assume it was in 1938, with the exception of one younger brother, who also went to the Netherlands. So, that is for background information on the family in Germany. I --"

            "question": "What happened to the brother in the Netherlands?",
            "answer": "Good question. The brother in the Netherlands, did not think that anything was going to happen to him. Incidentally, he lived in Amsterdam, and when my father did say to him -- his name was Ludwig, \u201cLudwig, things are getting tight. Don\u2019t you think you should go into hiding?\u201d Ludwig had responded, \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to go to Westerbork, and I know that\u2019s where many of them are going and I\u2019m sure I will be all right.\u201d Obviously, he was not all right, he was killed in Sobibor. However, all the others, they lived and thrived in Baltimore, Maryland. So, to get back to Holland, we -- we settled in -- in Holland. These very nice people by the name of Pagrach found us a home and incidentally, they almost become surrogate family to us. They found us a home across the street and I seemed to have really bonded with them, calling them Uncle Ohm -- Ohm and Tumter and Oma and Opa, in lieu of having any Omas or Opas around me. So, my father started his new life and seemed to do quite nicely, I think, from an economic point of view, we -- we were all right. My mother was and still is, a very gregarious woman and she quickly made friends. In the German Jewish community, it seems that in the town of Dinksburlow, a lot of German Jews came over the border and settled there. And my mother managed to make contact with some of them and she used to have her Saturday afternoon coffee klatches with them and seemed to be fairly content with her life, although I think living in a small town like that must have been a little bit frustrating to her. I really don\u2019t know if she was always very happy living in Dinksburlow."

            "question": "Was she a very cultivated person, who\u2019d love music and theater and so on that cities -- city life would offer?",
            "answer": "No, unfortunately she was not -- was not and is not. She was a very good looking, young woman and I think somewhat indulged in by both her father, as well as my father. She was more interested in being courted than perhaps going to theaters, to concerts, to movies, etcetera. She read. I don\u2019t know how much she read, but she read. I really don\u2019t know what her interests at that time were, other than to be able to set a nice table and to entertain her friends. And my father was a very, very good provider, but he too did not seem to be very much connected with -- he was quiet with the community. He would go on Saturdays to synagogue, which was the proper thing for everyone to do. He would play cards, I believe, perhaps once a week with some of, again, the German Jews. They led a fairly self-contained life and there was really not much culture in and around that area. And this is sort of the atmosphere I grew up in. I adored my mother. I was very much attached to her, to the point where I would be with her if I could have been with her, morning, noon and night. I was less attached to my father. I guess I admired my mother. She was a very good looking, always very well groomed, dressed lady and I must have been quite taken by that."

            "answer": "Yes. I asked my mother once why it was that I was an only child and she said, \u201cWell, the circumstances were not exactly propitious to have more children. And of course, obviously, it was -- it was a g -- inadvertently, it was a good decision, because I think it would have been very difficult for us to have found two hiding place -- I mean, hiding places for several children. I don\u2019t think I considered myself to be a very spoiled child, but I don\u2019t know, of course, that\u2019s not for me to judge. My mother was very, very strict, a fairly tough taskmaster or mistress and I was expected to obey and she -- in many ways she controlled me quite a bit, because if I were offered a cookie by a stranger, I would look and see if she would nod and say yes, you may take the cookie, or no you may not take the cookie. And expected to make my little curtsy when I shook hands with somebody and things like that. She -- She was strict, my dad was not. He was more -- I think he was more loving, a little warmer than she. I -- It\u2019s very hard to recall the en -- really, the environment too much. It -- I think, in many ways, that I perhaps got more nurturing from my adopted family, the Pagrachs or more attention from the Pagrachs, than I might have gotten at home. It\u2019s very difficult to describe this so many, many years later. In any case --"

            "question": "Well, you know a thought occurs to me. It\u2019s interesting that your mother would seem to be perhaps a -- a little self centered and yet, when tested by life, she came through with such flying colors, of courage and fortitude and optimism, which is remarkable. I wonder if you think those strengths in both your parents really came through s -- a spiritual sense? A s -- Convictions that were deep in the background?",
            "answer": "I doubt it. I really, really doubt it, but I think your point 1s well taken. There was this sort of -- well, what? They were not -- They were not as warm or giving as I think they could have been. I don\u2019t know, but spiritual? I think it was a matter of, we have to survive, we want to survive and no further thoughts were given to it. It\u2019s very possible. In any event, I would say it was a -- a good childhood, it was nothing extraordinary. I -- I got what I think I should have gotten and what I needed and I had my little friends, who would come to the house and play with me. I read a lot, I went to the library and got very many books and I was encouraged to read. I think my mother read to me. My mother, incidentally played the piano and would play for me sometimes. But, I have no remembrances of either one of my parents ever playing with me, playing games or really doing very many so-called fun things. I\u2019ve tried to -- to think if there were instances and the only instance I can remember where I was taken somewhere just for my pleasure, was some -- I guess you would call it a very fancy playground in another town. But then again, my town, Dinksburlow, did not have many opportunities for very many activities, so we had to make our own. We certainly managed to do that and did it very, very well, I think. So life in Dinksburlow really went on with friends and this -- the Pagrachs."

After the war, the Pagrachs came back to Dinksburlow to, they were in hiding. One sister perished, her name was Lien and I had the letter from the Red Cross in which they notified the family that Lien had died in Sobibor.

            "answer": "Mm-Hm. Well, my father and -- arranged -- 1t was not done through an organized resistance. My father, because he knew very many farmers, had sort of, in a discreet way, tried to find who could he trust, who could he not trust and who could he contact and who could he not contact. And found -- And knew a farmer with whom he had been doing business and had sort of dropped a hint, saying, you know, things are getting tough for us and when push comes to shove, I think we -- we probably have to try and hide ourselves rather than report. And this man, whose name was Yolink and this figures very prominently in my survival, said, \u201cWell, I have these --,\u201d I think they were cousins of his and they were sh -- teachers. And he said, \u201cThey are involved in the underground movement, or in the resistance movement and why don\u2019t you talk to them, because I think they may know some people. But,\u201d he said, \u201cI, myself, would be more than happy to take you.\u201d And, so that was arranged, that my father would meet those two ladies. And they -- And they\u2019d had probably a number of addresses, one -- two of whom were the people where we ended up being in contact with. But, above all, Mr. Yolink said to my father, \u201cI would be happy to kee-keep you, but not your wife and child, because I can only take one person.\u201d And that\u2019s how we came to Yolink and then my father learned about the other families, but did not meet them at all. It was just a name -- two names that were given to him. And one of the families had said they would take me and the other family said they\u2019d take my mother and her mother, my grandmother, who, remember I said, had been left behind in Germany, and came to live with us."

I think it was religion, slash, humanitarian need to help your fellow man, because interestingly -- and I\u2019m jumping ahead a little bit now, when I have spoken to them about why, they -- they sort of look at me in amazement and they say, \u201cWell, we\u2019d do it all over again.\u201d And Yolink\u2019s son said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think it was such a big deal.\u201d Well, it was a big deal indeed, because, after all, they put their lives and their farms and their families on the line for us, but over and over, over the years, they have said, no, they would do it again and it was only the right thing to do. So, I guess it was indeed Christian as well as humanitarian."

And I wonder if you\u2019d talk more about that. And I was interested also, when your host family -- and I think it was the mother who prayed, were -- did you also -- those of you who were Jewish, did you also offer thanks? Do you remember if there was more to the ceremony\u201d?",
            "answer": "Well, it wasn\u2019t really a ce -- I don\u2019t know if it wa -- 1t wasn\u2019t really a ceremony, it was all -- the war was over and we all came out of our little crevices and, as I had mentioned before, we sat around this, what looked to me like a huge, round table, the same table they sat at every night and they ate their porridge and then they played the organ and they sang hymns. So that the day of liberation, Mutter Hartaming, Mother Hartaming said, \u201cWell, we should all sit down and eat,\u201d I guess the porridge or whatever it was, together and all of us did there, six, seven children, Father and Mutter Hartaming. My mother, my father and I, two or three other young men that were s-semi hiding there and our neighbors, whom I talked about on my tape, that had crawled into the hole with us for the last few weeks. And we all sat around that table and then Mutter Hartaming simply said, \u201cWell, let us pray.\u201d And we all sat and we bowed our heads and then she said, \u201cI want to thank the good Lord for having allowed us to survive this and to be able to save --\u201d and she named all of us and sort of said, \u201cWe thank the good Lord.\u201d And we all sat and then we said amen, and that was it and I think there were many a wet -- not too many dry eyes left after that. Also, I think the Sunday after our liberation, we came back to the farm to accompany all of them to the church for a service, where we sat and prayed with them. We looked at the prayer books and prayed with them. Being Jewish didn\u2019t make any difference. And it was a very beautiful moment."

Would your parents -- I mean, would you be sitting in your -- the arms of one of your parents at that farmhouse table and think you were very weak, at the end of the war, but I wonder if the others too, were poorly nourished and ragged in your clothing and so on?",
            "answer": "As a matter of fact, no. I think all of us who came out, probably looked as well as we did when we went in. My mother, who was blonde, I think her har -- her hair may have darkened a little bit. And I had gotten rather heavy and I think part of this was due to the illness, coupled with inactivity and I think I was a rather roly-poly, with long hair. My father looked the same as he always did and the farmers themselves -- of course, we did not suffer from any malnourishment. We were always very adequately provided for. It may not have been gourmet food, but it certainly was good food and we -- what they had, they shared with us. So no, I think -- and clothing-wise, it\u2019s funny -- I don\u2019t remember that too well, I know I must have outgrown the few clothes that I had when I went in, but I also know that as soon as we came out, someone gave me clothes, perhaps some friends, to fit me and my mother immediately went in search of her dressmaker and found some material to have herself some dresses made. And dad had probably the same clothes he had before the war, so there was no -- no problem there, and I know when the war was over, we went back to Dinksburlow and the first thing I did -- and I don\u2019t know why I did it, I had, at that time, very long braids, and I had them cut off, because I thought I had to start to look a little older, but I don\u2019t think it helped."

My mother looked far -- well, my mother almost looked -- almost looked Aryan, because of her blonde hair, her sort of bluish gray eyes, whereas my father and I were typically Semitic looking people, very dark and that was another reason it was fortunate that I could go to the farm with my mother, rather than to the farm that I was pegged to go to, because I could not have been free to roam around, since I did look too Jewish."

There is the memory of my grandmother coming, which was a major, major event. She was my uncle\u2019s -- my uncle and aunt had left to go to Israel, she was left Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection behind.

And she was set to go -- she must have been in her late 60\u2019s, to me she looked ancient -- and came to a border town with all her earthly belongings, her jewelry and lots of luggage and she was sent back, which was a tremendous blow and I really don\u2019t know why that happened, but she was sent back to Germany and then was not able to come back til the following year, which was already in 1940 or maybe it was even \u201c41, I don\u2019t know.

And when we came back after the war -- first of all, our house was 90 -- 85 percent destroyed and my father said some of the furniture, he could even find in the woods, still, it was just chopped up. But the people that had taken the bulk of it, returned it all to us and the silver and the crystal and whatever it was, was uncovered and it all came with us to the United States.

As a matter of fact, I think some of our personal things were taken to the farmers in advance of our going there, which must have included some clothing items, because when we went on the bike, the evening that we were taken to the farm, I don\u2019t remember that we had anything with us. So, clothing and some personal items were taken along, but I don\u2019t remember that anything specific of mine went along with me. Perhaps a few books, I know my mother had a few books.

Come to think of it, I must have left all my books and toys, or whatever it was, behind. And I must have also left it behind without looking back or giving it further thoughts, because perhaps it wasn\u2019t meaningful enough or it was just, well, we had to go and don\u2019t think more about it."

I had dreams after the war was over and for many, many years -- subsequent years, including after I came to the United States and it was always the same dream, namely, I had two very good friends. They lived within shouting distance, if you will, of where we lived. Their name was Menist, M-e-n-i-s-t. There was a boy, he was the grandson of the local rabbi and his sister and my parents were very good friends with their parents. And we were always playing. As a matter of fact, I would almost say they were amongst my best friends, and they were deported. And after the war, I dreamt that I were -- I dreamt that they had survived and they came back. And I would go to their house, where they lived, and there would be a woman and perhaps it was the mother who said, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t see them today, but come back tomorrow.\u201d And then my dr-dream continued. I would go back and she would always say, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t see them now, but come back tomorrow.\u201d And that dream haunted me for years and years and years after the war. And, as I said before, even after I arrived in the United States. And that was about the only dream."

            "answer": "Yes. They were both killed in Sobibor, too. Most of the Jews in the village where we were, were taken to Sobibor and I know that for a fact, because of the research I\u2019ve done. And speaking of the Menist children, they too were a big part in my life, because th-the grandfather was the local rabbi and he attempted to give us Hebrew lessons, instill some Jewishness in us and we would meet every week, on Sunday, in his kitchen and he would teach us a little bit of history and little bit of the reading. But I was never very interested and besides, Eeshe, the boy -- there were two other boys, who were also friends of mine. And the rabbi was very critical of me because I wouldn\u2019t come to service every Saturday as he thought I should. I did go sometimes. I would sit in the women\u2019s section and instead of reading a prayer book, I would read Tilonspiegel. And he would sometimes come home from the synagogue and walk through the streets to go home and I would be Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection out on the street playing and then on Sunday I would arrive at his house and he said, \u201cI saw you playing with the Gentile children. I don\u2019t want to see that any more.\u201d And then one day he said to me, \u201cYou are not coming to synagogue often enough and the reason, Oma Pagrach 1s ill, is because you don\u2019t come to the synagogue enough.\u201d And I -- I guess I must have been about eight, nine, 10, I don\u2019t know, and it was, I got very angry at that and I said, \u201cI\u2019m not staying here.\u201d I got up and I was ready to leave, and Eeshe, his grandson said, \u201cWell, shall I keep her?\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, let her go.\u201d And I ran out of there and it was bitter cold, without a coat. And on my way home, I see a little girlfriend, I say, \u201cGo back there and fetch my coat.\u201d And I walked into the house and I said to my mother, \u201cI will not go back, because he blames me for Oma Pagrach being ill.\u2019 And my mother said, \u201cI agree with you.\u201d And that was the end of my Jewish education and so therefore, I\u2019m totally uneducated and that was an incident I remembered quite well. Sadly, of course, he too was deported and died in Sobibor."

It was as if you are constantly inhaling dust, but of course it didn\u2019t -- there was an odor to it, too. So, it was big enough that we could stretch out in it and we were lying there. I don\u2019t think we could sit [indecipherable] positive. And they would -- they put us in there and we had a little receptacle in case we had to use the toilet facilities. And must have been given some food. What I do remember quite well though, 1s at night, the daughter, or one of the daughters would come, open the lid and told us to go out, because this was in a -- in an attic-like place. Opened up the lid, we would go out, stretch, walk and we were given food at that time and I guess maybe we washed ourselves. It\u2019s -- It is truly very vague. And while we were lying in there, my mother and I would of course talk incessantly and she always tried to put a positive thing on everything, this is only going to be a short time, they are going to find us another place and told me stories, which she did the whole time anyhow. But also, during that time, I wasn\u2019t well. And I think that was the -- probably already a forerunner of what was to come, because one evening, when the daughter took us out, I had chills and I was really not feeling well. I had the sore throat already. So, mother was ma -- mother was positive and I was, I think, fairly weepy and well, we stayed there and I wish I remembered how long it was. I can\u2019t believe it was all too long and then we were transferred to the other wonderful palace that I called it, that we occupied for the remainder of the time. And, with respect to my father, there was little contact and strange, I -- I wasn\u2019t homesick for my father.

Also, I had difficulties. Remember, I had missed school for many, many years and it was very hard to catch up. And I think the reason the Montessori school came along as my -- again, the Pagrachs suggested my mother take me to the city of Arnam and have some testing done to see what I was capable of doing. And I do remember I was taken to Arnam, which at the time was considered to be the big city, and I was tested and when the report came back, it said that perhaps I should be sent to a school where I could progress at my own speed and see what would happen to me and then make a decision later on. And I think that\u2019s how the Montessori came about, which was really a terrific decision, because again, the Montessori school was very good for me. I could indeed progress at my own speed. I may have progressed in the wrong areas, because I concentrated more on -- on learning languages and literature and history rather than in math. But, it was a good environment, I was around young people my own age for the first time ever. And it was a little bit of an adjustment to be suddenly thrown into this- this type of an environment. It was a fairly exclusive school and very, very small. But, I made some friends and I was very happy there. I had a very nice time and we\u2019d go home every few weeks for a weekend and in turn would be invited at some newly made friends home for a weekend and it was a rather posh school. We learned dancing and sailing and hockey and tennis and it was all very nice. But, then, after two years at Montessori, I was 16 and had I stayed at Montessori, I would have ultimately have to take what they call a state or a final exam, to matriculate, and I was very concerned about it, too, because I did not know if I was up to par. And the family in the United States kept agitating that I should come and spend a year there, just to forget about what had happened or -- and I think the reason they did that too, because they were hoping that my parents, particularly my father would ultimately come and be reunited with his siblings. So, I said yes. I guess, to me, it was an adventure to go across the big ocean to the United States and to be independent and go on my -- be on my own, although I had to -- I was going to live with my father\u2019s family. So, the idea was for me to go for a year, go to school in Baltimore and then come back.

But, I had to pick up that ship in Lahavre and my parents could not go. By the way, they never got their Dutch citizenship, they kept their ger -- well, we were stateless.

We were sort of left to our own devices and it was a 10 day journey. I was a little bit seasick and I think I was quite homesick already then, too. But she -- she was very wonderful.

And Margot was -- must have been met by someone, too, and then I met them and it was very emotional. My uncle was crying and my aunt was crying and then it was my mother\u2019s cousin and her husband and an aunt who were also there. And we first went to someone\u2019s house, it was my aunt\u2019s sister, where we were probably given a meal. And then we drove to Baltimore from New York in my -- what I thought, my uncle\u2019s enormous, big car and I was really awed by all the cars, by all the buildings. It was just vast, 1t was very impressive as well as intimidating. But what was more intimidating -- when we got to Baltimore, we didn\u2019t immediately go to my uncle\u2019s home, we went to my aunt, that was my father\u2019s older sister, with whom I was supposed to stay. And we get into the house -- she was a remarkable lady, my Aunt Eva, and -- by the way, they all spoke German, of course, and English, but my German was almost nonexistent, because I remembered a little bit from my grandmother, who spoke German, but I always spoke Dutch. So my German was not very good, but I managed. And my English was fairly poor, too. So I get -- I arrive in my aunt\u2019s house and the house was full of people -- well, they wanted to all be there and give me a big welcome and there were -- there was another aunt and her husband and lots of cousins and cousins children. It was really overwhelming and I was very, very intimidated and frightened and then my cousin, who was my aunt\u2019s daughter still living with her, could see that I was close to tears, and she said to me, \u201cCome with me to the kitchen. I -- There is some mail here for you from -- I think from friends in Holland.\u201d And I remember she took me to the kitchen and she gave me a banana. And I looked at that mail -- I think I\u2019m getting very sentimental about it, and there were letters from all my friends from school, you know, oh, you must be in United States now and how wonderful and how anxious they are to hear from me. But it was very smart of my cousin to have done that, to have removed me from all these people that were sort of standing over me and wanting to know everything. So, she must have gone back into the living room and told them to disperse. And th-they did. And then, eventually, it was just my cousin, her name was Erma and my aunt and I, who were left. And well, I -- they said I have to share the bedroom with my aunt and my cousin, cause my aunt was a widow. She came to the United States with her two daughters, she was widowed. And she had a fairly big house, but she rented rooms. So the three of us all slept in the same room. And my cousin was getting ready to get married shortly after I arrived, so it was just my aunt and I that were left behind, but she was a very forceful woman. Now, I arrived in July and she said, \u201cWell, in September, you\u2019re going to go to the high school here and I will arrange it.\u201d And in the meantime, the summer was there and we visited another aunt whose daughter had lived -- lived in Cumberland.

And she was -- I think she probably was at -- with me and for me at the right time.

So I realized, well, that was good, because that would mean I would graduate at age 18, as all normal children would. Had I stayed in Holland, I would have probably been 20 or 21 before I would have gotten that diploma.

So, this young woman, Ellen, took me to school.

Some for mercenary reasons, because I had heard of cases where, money gone, you\u2019re gone now, too and that happened, but I don\u2019t know how many instances there were. I did hear about it, but all in all, after the war, or not even after the war, in recent years I learned that the Dutch percentage -- the Dutch people were not as helpful or as cooperative with respect to saving Jews, as some of the other countries did, but even some eastern European countries had a higher rate, shall we call it, of having saved or managed to help Jews, than the Dutch did. And part of 1t may have been the government, because when the war broke out, the queen hotfooted it over to England and the Princess Julianna and her children went to Canada. And I think Prince Bernard served 1n the -- in the English army or some -- in the Dutch division, I think, of the English army, I don\u2019t know. But, articles have said, or books have said, that Queen He -- Wilhelmina could have done more to help her Jewish compatriots than she did and apparently, according to literature, she had sort of said, yes, it\u2019s too bad what\u2019s happening, but has not made a real tremendous effort to help. And perhaps that set the tone, I don\u2019t know, but the NSB in Holland, the Dutch Nazi party, was quite active and again, more people could have been helped than were helped, as compared to the French, who had a higher record of having saved people. Course, the Danes were amazing. Belgium and so forth. Holland came out very low on the list and I can\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know why."

And shortly after the war broke out, perhaps a year after it, all of a sudden, the child was no longer allowed to play with me and then we learned that the father had joined the NSB. Now, Mr. Fisher, that policeman next door to us -- he was born in Germany, interestingly -- he had told us, he said, \u201cWatch out for the neighbor across the street, he joined the party.\u201d He -- He was just a totally unprejudiced man, as was a neighbor two doors further down, who was also a low level official in the local government, who was also very pro-Jewish and also very interested in us and incidentally, I think that he too knew -- yeah, he knew we were going into hiding so he es -- he -- he was very helpful and very well aware of it. So there you have two people who were helpful -- didn\u2019t put their life on the line, but at the same time, did not hesitate to have commerce with us, which is -- which was very brave in later times, when we were no longer supposed to be associating with non-Jewish people and they -- they did.

So, it -- I -- I don\u2019t know and I also don\u2019t know in general what the - what the beliefs in -- of the people in the village were.

What we had in common is, we were raised in the same country, we spoke the same language and we were both Jewish. We had survived the Holocaust, and that\u2019s another topic that I want to address brief -- albeit briefly. Yes, survive the Holocaust we did, but I never considered myself a survivor as I do consider those people that were in the camps and my husband feels very much the same way. I wish there were another word for it, becau -- in a way, it\u2019s a misnomer. Perhaps it should be called, you know, concentration camp survivor, versus a hidden person or -- there must be another word for it, because I think what we went through was a snap, honestly, compared to what people suffered in all the different camps. And my husband feels very strongly about that, too. That people such as we, or some of the people that he has seen on tape because of his volunteer work that he does in the oral history, are not really that much related to the -- should not really be pegged as survivors. They may have played a role of sorts, but it\u2019s -- the people that survived the concentration camps should be in a category all to themselves, that\u2019s really, I think, an important thing to know -- to be aware of, because they are unique, I think. What I think is very sad, though, 1s, with all that has happened, with the awareness, with the education, with the -- the Schindler\u2019s List, etcetera, etcetera, man\u2019s inhumanity to man continues. So what has -- what has history taught us? I don\u2019t know. This I find very disturbing and very shocking. I mean, if you think about Kosovo, it\u2019s frightening.

And then we married and we really never talked about it any more -- very little. Perhaps alluded to it here and there. And then the children came, Tanya first, in \u201857 and David in 1960 and I think neither one of us ever really made it a point to -- to sit down and say, \u201cWell, you want to know about what happened to us.\u201d We may have touched it, we may have talked about it here and there, but not in depth. And I think, as we got older, as the -- as we were less involved in the children\u2019s lives, namely once they were out of college and out on their own, if you will, I think much later we started to think more about it and to discuss it more. And even, you know, going more into details of what happened to us, particularly in my case, because my husband was always much more reluctant to talk about it because, you know, his parents, of course, had a very horrible ending. And, as we sometimes said, he never really had a chance to grieve for them and it was always a little difficult for him to talk about it. And as time went on, it wasn\u2019t as if we were hiding anything. We answered and they knew I was in hiding and where I was in hiding and so forth and so on. But I think 1t became very much topic A after I -- after we got involved with the Holocaust Museum and after I gave my testimony and after my t -- my tape. And I think then, we started to talk much more about what was than we did in the earlier years. And I think part of it -- I really wasn\u2019t deliberate -- I think 1t was more we were very much engaged in working, bringing up children and making a life and did not really dwell on what was. And I think, as we got older, we thought back, more about what happened and it\u2019s a reminiscence, really. And again, as I said, the tape was sort of a -- a final presentation to them, as to the what and the whereabouts -- the wheres. Also, my sister-in-law in Israel just recently sent a little praysee on their trip from Holland to Geneva. She wrote it in Dutch and my husband 1s going to translate it, also, again, for all the children to have.

Wh-What they have given to the United States?",
            "answer": "That\u2019s difficult to answer, because I have not really thought about that, so it w -- it\u2019s going to be a pretty superficial answer. There are many of them who have made significant contributions to United States and life in the United States, I think. As witnessed by the people that are very actively involved there, Mr. Lerner, and -- Lehrman, I mean, Miles Lehrman and so forth and Benjamin Neeves. They have done wonderful things. And I\u2019m sure there are very many others. I want to add, though, something else. There 1s the hidden child -- it\u2019s -- what 1s it called? Fonde -- no, not. The hidden child -- can\u2019t think of the other word. It\u2019s a group of surviving children that were in hiding. I have been -- They were in touch with me, I know someone who\u2019s involved in it. and I don\u2019t very much believe in all these organized, you know, th-the children of survivors and the hidden children, how helpful that is or how meaningful all that is. I guess, to join together and to discuss what -- what happened, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very productive."

I think the state of Israel has been -- the creation of the state of Israel has been a very important milestone for the Jews and I think without the existence of the state of Israel, I think we would be far more vulnerable than we are now.

So that was very, very -- and -- and the frustration of being indoors all the time was very, very difficult, where I couldn\u2019t see the sunshine and had a real longing for the sunshine. And the happy time was that one and only time when they carried me out into the wheat fields and I did see the sun. Funny, no. There was not very much that was funny. The mice procreating above us, maybe it was funny. Oh no, no I can\u2019t say there was anything really light, no. And anguishing, yes, to me there was always a certain fear, notwithstanding my mothers constant optimism, are we going to get out of here and what\u2019s going to happen once we get out of there. No, I can\u2019t really address that too well."
