And he helped me out and I f ound myself on the other side in the morning. People on the borderline were very wonderful people . They fed me, they washed me a little bit, because I stunk like a beaver. And after a few hour s I arrived to Siedlce because I thought my grandmother is still in my place where I was born, Siedlce. When I arrived there I only met my aunt. My grandmother was in Warsaw at that time.

            "answer": "Oh yes, the same thing, and we went through Kemnitz, I remember, station all the way around Czechoslovakia. They didn\u2122t go through Czechosl ovakia, all the way around Czechoslovakia. Flossenburg is situated in Northern Bavaria close to town of Weiden and that was -- we didn\u2122t know why we are there but we started working on the Shtassenbau Commando, two mountains which we were about to cut to certain level and f ill the gap in the valley to create a highway. A few guys died at that time. We had two Jewish friends, prisoners, with us. They killed one by name of Blum. He was famous in Jewish societ y in Poland. Plus two additional guys that they told us they would be transferred to camp wh ere they have additional Jewish prisoners. In Flossenburg we had no Jewish prisoners. So I had, there were many stories I could tell you about my presence in Flossenburg camp but that was camp that I finally transferred to the Messerschmitt factory that they had in the mountain. We were not afraid of any air raids or anything because it was in the quarry."

And that was also very good because I had one more dish of soup just to maintain my physical strength for the game. Germans were betting on me how many goals I w ill shoot.

Their national holiday, May 1, soci al what they call MS and they are pair, right? National Socialistice Deutsch Arbeit Bartai. And from this point on it was a little bit better. They added sugar to our morning tea so you can imagine, huh ? Now two things happened. First, after unfortunate uprising in Warsaw th e first prisoners arrived from Wa rsaw directly to Flossenburg. And second thing happened\u2013."

And the s econd thing happened, the plague of typhus. So I experiences I mentioned to you, red box in Poviak forgot to tell you about fleas in hospital in Auschwitz. Tremendous fleas th at you could cry because you couldn\u2122t catch them and they were biting you all night long. And here lice. To receive set of shorts and shirt you had to exchange these two items for one portion of bread. Bread was like money. You could buy anything with portion, daily portion, of the prisoner\u2122s daily portion of bread. I tell you what value of bread was, one Komisbrodt the German military shvartz brodt that was similar to our pumpernickel, you know black pumpernickel, it wa s also like square, so divided into four portions. One bread was one beautiful white-b lue diamond, that was th e corresponding value, okay. So after that I, not only Polish but al so Czechs and German prisoners were dying. Germans in camp were always occupying some f unctions whether they were in charge of the barracks or in charge of your work commando or whatever. However there were also Czechs in Flossenburg. In Auschwitz, majority were Polish. About 80% were Polish. Here, however, we had about 40% of Czechs, maybe 35% of Poles and other nationalities, including Americans, the flyers who were shot down. They were ther e but very short period of time and they were immediately executed. Now to finish my story, I was there till April 21. We started moving in group of 5000 surrounded by again Ukrainian SS."

Out of 30,000 prisoners they killed 15, 000. Whoever couldn\u2122 t walk they were shot in the ditch with dum-dum bullets. They were all found after li beration by the Third Army members, General Patton\u2122s army. We had possibility of getti ng taken care of immediate by the American Red Cross hospital, field hospital, and I went with my friends, tried to go as far a possible west. We arrived to Erlangen near Nuremberg. Erlange n was not bombed, was academic city with a university there. First camp for refugees was formed by the US army."

Was a beautiful, beautiful, never to forget situation, because we were concentrated on the mountain and we have seen on the other mountain, we have seen first American tanks and together with us there were Soviet army members who jumped on the Ukrainian SS guards. They shot them, killed them instantly and with the guns they were started moving toward the American troops. Since that was some kind of horseshoe area we were trying to go into the valley and then come up the mountain and making ourselves a short cut. And when we were , we were there three of us, we found a group of SS soldiers armed to their teeth and we almost got killed. It\u2122s unbelievable, right there. You sense you had freedom in the air and you could be killed at the last moment. That was my fourth time when I faced the gun. And good thing that my friend spoke German and then we said we are Germans from Silesia. We want to go home now. So he said only as Germans don\u2122t tell them that we are here. My luck was that when I arrived to the first group of the Yanks, the commanding officer I think of the fi rst division of the Third Army and most of them were Poles from Buffalo, New York area and almost ever y second spoke Polish, broken Polish, but they knew Polish language. So I told him in Polish who we met on our way here. So he said okay you will see what\u2122s going to happen and they shot immediately first warning like a rocket down to the valley. After a few moments lower white flag arrived at the main building, just like city hall or something like that and he said look what\u2122s gonna happen now. And all these tanks maybe a dozen of them from all around the area they started shooting everything they could reach."

He said that first they had special machine to ej aculate him when he was normal person with two testicles and then after that they removed one testicle. After three weeks they called him for another ejaculation just to comp are how human sperm can work, can be used with one and two. With women we have seen something they were working but this will be described in my book."
