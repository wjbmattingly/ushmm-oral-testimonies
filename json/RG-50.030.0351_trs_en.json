And then one day, I go in the park because there's a razzia, it will be in that street. I should go in the park that will be safe. So I went to the park. One man, a Nazi newspaperman, was in charge of the building where I stayed and he 1s there in the park and he stops me. And we talked together, and then he says where I am from. And I said I didn't even know because my Hungarian name, I still had Hungarian name, Jewish name. And he said he's going to my city. I said my mother was yesterday here and he wanted to say something to him, that he should go to visit my mother because he knew the city. I said don't go because my mother was yesterday here. Then he takes my pocketbook away with force. In that pocketbook was my life. If you don't have any papers with you, you're dead. And I knew he's a Nazi newspaperman. I knew he's in charge of that building, and I run after him. He said, \"Why are you so nervous?\" I remember he's asking like now. And I said, \"I am insulted that you took with force my papers. You didn't ask for them.\" He tells me, \"I thought that you are a very naive girl. Now, I know that you are raffiniert?\u00b0.\". Like shrewd, raffiniert. Raffiniert is more like a shrewd girl, a Hebrew girl. \"Just tell me when you came from Czechoslovakia to this country.\" He did not report me. I left. Two weeks later somebody went there .... Were such magic things, such un.... When I am walking on the street and a policeman is coming. And a man behind me came over, and he says I \u2014 he knows me. I never saw him before, I didn't even know he exist there. You know such coincidence. And in the restaurant, policeman was \u2014 he got shut this door and he brought Nyilas, you know, the Nazi Nyilas? And he said I should identify myself. You know identification cards. I said, \"I left them home.\" You know, just to let \u2014 well, anyway many such episodes. Many, many, many more. At night I was waken up at midnight. I should him the papers, and that cantor's wife's sister was with me. Said, \"Don't be next time without paper identification,\" and left me there. Another story they locked me in the restaurant and my \u2014 my kosher restaurant in Dob utca nine [9 Dob Street], and he said, \u201cA Nazi's coming in to check everybody. You run.\" I left everything, run on the street day time. It was \u2014 you didn't know what you're doing from minute to minute. I was a maid because I didn't want to eat. Going to eat places. Then I was washing the dishes in the restaurants, so I should have food, I should not be hungry. Washing dishes in a restaurant by myself, unbelievable."

And I was kosher and I went every day, and there was a boy and I met him there. And he said he is having \u2014 he has identification papers if somebody wants it, but for money. I had no money. I was lucky I have from day to day \u2014 if you worked a week, you could buy yourself on black market one slice \u2014 one loaf of bread. But normally, you had to work for a week. But I said to that boy, \u201cI have one ring. I had a ring from home, from my hometown, a small ring. I give you that ring in deposit. The woman cannot come today over to bring me money, but she has to get the papers today because tomorrow, you never know what happens to her. So leave me the papers. You come tomorrow if you want to, to my place, and I give you cash. I see her tonight. I promised her to bring her the papers.\" He said, \u201cI cannot give you. I need the money.\" I said, \"I cannot \u2014 you cannot,\" \u2014 he was in my room. \"You cannot go away with that paper now. You have to give me that paper.\" \"I can't.\" I said, \"I don't care. Here is my ring. Take my ring.\" So he listened. It was good, and I went to give that paper to her. And then she gave me her bracelet, which I carried, I thought if \u201cshe will come back. At once \u2014I don't ked it, I will have everything after the war. Give her back.\" So she gave me her ring and her bracelet and, of course, she didn't come back. And one woman the same way, I give her the papers, that boy left the papers without money. Give her another ring. The same ring I gave for two people, I took back that ring. And she came back, but she couldn't survive; her body didn't work. They didn\u2019t eat and they ate and then they got sick, and it was so she didn't.

Mr. Adler \u2014 nobody was Jewish anymore, okay? 194\u2014 end of 1943 and '44 beginning, no Jews.*\u2019 And so Adler, we met in the restaurant occasionally, and he said, \"Here are your papers, and here is your money. And I have a place where I live, you can come to live there.\" But we didn't know each other. You know, we did not suppose to talk to each other, we didn't know each other, that they shouldn't suspect us. And so then I was lucky, he occasionally gave me money. And then to the end it wasn't good anymore either. So he left his \u2014 I didn't live there anymore. I had to find a new place. How did I find a new place? I was working in Rothchilds \u2014 in that elite salon, aristocrats. And I am going home, and my colleague, my girl, who was working with me dresses, I said to her, \"You know my housewife\" \u2014 how she said? \"My landlady \u2014 landlord has a guest. Her sister came from someplace, and I cannot stay there tonight. If you could take me, I will sleep on the floor. Anyplace you want just to have\" \u2014 5 o'clock is curfew. You cannot be on the street. So she let me, and that was my good luck and I stayed with her. But it was already bombing, constantly bombing it was on and on and on. I don't know if you want that part now. And I stayed \u2014 three Jewish \u2014 her brother-in-law and her two sisters, we were in the same building together. There was unselfishness, I would never believe it. She's asking me, \"Malvina, Gizi, when is Yom Kippur?\" She knew I am Jewish \u2014 didn\u2019t report me, and she \u2014 unbelievable how unselfish those people were while I was with them. You know, slice of bread or water, 1t was like life saver, and they didn't care. They gave me just as much as they had. We should come to the bunker how everybody had to be curfew and bombs were hitting the city constantly. And in a certain hour or a certain time, they were announcing each day, when we have to go in the bunker. Bunker, you know what 1s a bunker? So we went in the bunker one time tn the length of three months. Didn't go out, didn't go in. And one girl says, \"I can't stand it,\" a young woman. I just see her in front of my mind. \"I have to get water.\" \"Don't go, don't go, sweetheart.\" Bombs hit her and she never came back. Just for water, but she wanted to go there. But it was just such a critical time, people are \u2014 and that bunker life three months, unbelievable. Three months in one place, one seven-story building. And one day I am standing in front of the building \u2014 occasionally, I \u2014 she lived, we lived on the first floor \u2014 occasionally, we went up to the first floor. Not permitted, everybody had to be downstairs, but since it was first floor, so we went up. And I am standing in front of the window, and the bomb hit the whole building and that little window with my friend. Scattered bombs you know and all windows are broken. And we are here like a miracle. Nothing happened to both of us. And we couldn't eat; we had no place to go. The stores were closed and bombed out. You could steal \u2014 they didn't call it stealing. We had to work for it. Confiscating or something. Confiscating, but not stealing. And they had ice cream cones, so I took ice cream cones and put water in it. It was lucky, and my friend's uncle came. \u201c7 The conditions for Jews in Budapest quickly deteriorated after the German take over of the city on March 19, 1944. Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. \u201cBudapest.\u201d He was, he couldn't talk. He cried. He cried with tears. He's starving. A big, husky man is crying. So I gave him as much I could, and one day I went for a bread. They said that place will have bread, and I met a friend who pretended he's blind. He said, \u201cWhat the heck you doing on the street? It's curfew.\u201d No one was on the street. I was the only one. \u201cYou cannot do it. I'll give you money, if you need money. You don't go out on the street any longer.\" And that kind of \u2014 on the street, you couldn't see anyone. As I said, except the mountains dead people scattered in one section. And one restaurant was open one hour a day, and there were many dead people around here. You didn't mind. You just went through and went in and ate if you got a cup of soup, and went back again. Impossible, impossible conditions. Hygiene \u2014 there was none. Couldn't drink water, so how could you wash yourself with water?"

And then the other was his brother, Jan, with his girlfriend. I can't remember. And the other was \u2014 I can't remember. I just remember Perl Duri, with his friend \u2014 because I went to visit him after the war \u2014 with his mother survived. In Trencianski-Martin**. Trencianski-Martin, a Slovak in Tatry, he lived. I remember exactly. And then Salgo Tibor (ph) and Salgo Willie (ph), those two brothers. And then the other married couple, one more was missing, was there. I can't remember the names, but I have four names. And then one time \u2014 one day one of the brothers were missing, the Salgo, not married. The other was also single, Willie, and he is not in. So we wotried, since one is missing that's some bad news for everyone. So his brother worried, and he said after two weeks that he find his brother. He came out, he was captured by the Nazis, hanged 10 days from the ceiling with hands up in the back tied together. Cigarettes in the back testing how much he can take, and electrical wires in his mouth and, of course, tortured him as much they could. So, luckily, the bomb hit the building after 10 days to be tortured and hanging 3\u00b0 Varosliget 3+ Street name unverifiable. 5 Tur\u00e9ansky Svaty martin, CZ from the ceiling. He escaped, but he was blue, green and yellow, you know, from all this torture. He had to hide in the bunker, and when he came out, so he needed papers. With his papers he is lost. So, after he looked a little better, his brother decided that he will ask his General friend \u2014 Christian. He was working in the pharmacy, and then he met that General, Hungarian-Christian. And he gave him a paper that he requests from the National Printing Office, identification cards for laborers to work in a factory \u2014 in a munitions factory. And I will be there, they shouldn't give anybody the papers, just for me. And he's sending me, assistant, to the National Printing Office which was located \u2014 I see it now, like a \u2014 Vaci Utca, like in the Fifth Avenue. And his brother \u2014 I didn't know where that place is \u2014 took me. Three blocks away he was waiting, if I come out alive. So I went in, in the National Printing Office. There was a young man \u2014 luckily, I got them 500 identification cards. I didn't look at them. I just grab them. I don't know; I went out. I didn't breathe, I guess. Very \u2014 and then that boy was waiting for me who was hanged, you know. So I gave him the papers and he ran away, and he gave it to others that he had contact. What kind contact? That brother who was working in the pharmacy they made the arrangements to meet all the men there, and he will give them from the pharmacy \u2014 because it's open to the public, it's a safe place \u2014 and he said so many and so many people only, so many and so many hours. Divided the time they shouldn't be all at one time there. He said he saw everybody, he told me that he saw everybody who's coming in. But he was there incognito, they shouldn't see him; he was hiding behind in the back somehow. And I went there three times. I don't want to tell you how scared I was each time to go in. And the fourth time \u2014I got three times, okay, 500 and 500 \u2014 and the fourth time, they wouldn't give me it. But I noticed that they want to call the policeman on me, the Nazis, so I run out. How I did that, I don't know. So that was my lucky star in that time that I could make it. And there, I met them in 1981 \u2014 \u201981 when it was the international convention in Israel. My husband and Miriam were with me. [ed comment: met Tibor and Willie]"

Cold freezing hospitals. No heat and no drugs. He said it's a horrible, horrible condition.

Kitchens on the streets for everyone. But from the morning to the night I could wait for a cup of soup. I waited, and I got his soup and luckily and he could be in the hospital. But after a while, we decided we are going to Szeged, plenty food, another city \u2014 a doctors\u2019 university. So he went to enroll to the doctor, finish, and I was staying there till I wouldn't be hungry anymore. Once they got me, the policeman, I had wanted to sell. But they didn't put me in jail. You know, they just took away my blackmail \u2014 or black market. There it was already food plenty. Plenty food in Szeged. Then I wanted to see who's at home in Trebisov. I knew it's a magic, if somebody will come back. I didn't want to dream. I still \u2014 I took a train overnight, three weeks on the top of the train and I traveled. And Red Cross occasionally stopped the train and gave us soup or something, so in three weeks I came home traveling on the top of the roof. Soldiers went home. The soldiers didn't want to go back to Russia. They got an order if you're not coming three times. If you're not coming on the third order, you will be sent to Siberia. So then they went back on the same train what I went on the top of the train. And I came home and, of course, there 1s \u2014 we owned a house and a restaurant, and my mother still owed money on that building. So I stayed till I could make \u2014 pay off the house.

And she hit me, and I wanted, you know, sentimental things what I could out from there, so I took a policeman and we went back. She hit me again in front of him. Such a\u2014 soaked over Communism \u2014 I mean, Nazism. Everybody was a Nazi. One boy who hit my brother, gave him to the policeman, he says while I was there \u2014 stopped me on the street, he said: \"I wanted to save your brother.\" Gosh, I was so mad at him. I was so mad. I went to the office, I said, \"How come you still have that man free?\" So he says, \"We have a new Bible. If somebody hits you on one side, you give him the other side.\" I said, \"It's good that you didn't build a monument for the killers here.\" But then I left, I didn't \u2014I stayed till I..."

If you want to leave the DP in the free world, you could get prepared in that place if you didn't have any profession. Like my little cousin who lived with me, she was gorgeous and 17. So I told her to go and study Hebrew; she did. I told \u201c1 In a later conversation interviewee clarifies that it was Matyas Rakosi she meant to refer to here. her to go to, I was like a mother to her, go to make \u2014 learn dressmaking. She made, she went. So when she came to the United States after years, lucky, she studied in that dressmaker design school, and she became a very good dressmaker. So you could make yourself anything you wanted to in that camp, if you wanted to. But I didn't feel like I wanted \u2014 life was very, very limited and simple. But you had friends it was such a tight together. You know, like you're my brother, you're my sister. You didn't feel like strange person there, 1t was one whole big family. If you see a man, you didn't look at him like a man. But you looked and, \u201cOh, my gosh, thank God he's here. That's my brother.\u201d If you didn't have any \u2014 you know if you didn't feel like a man. But it was all \u2014 or a sister or anybody, you had such a unity. And life was very, very simple, and those people really didn't have too much strength to do anything more \u2014 they went to eat. You went to lunch, get the dinner that little rations, what they got. In the morning, breakfast, a little cereal, tiny milk, and that was it. You were hungry constantly even with the rations you got, you got there. But many people managed some way to make money. Some way that they wouldn't have to be hungry. But from that rations, you had to be hungry. You didn't have to starve to death, but it wasn't enough. And then the clothing, you could get free. So you didn't have any worries how you get a dress, and rooms were free, of course. One room we were four people in. My cousin and me and her brother and a little strange boy. It was nothing unusual to have a strange man in that room, or Nazis or with numbers or \u2014 I mean survivors. It was nothing unusual. It was just accepted thing that girl \u2014 not scared \u2014 man, no man wasn't such thing in that time. She was Orthodox, my cousin. She is still, and it wasn't a difference. Not supposed to be in the same room according to the \u2014 you know, regulations, Jewish. But was no difference, and courses, they emphasized Hebrew courses very much."

Six months later, three months later, and it was always one year, two years, three years. For me it was 'til 1947. It wasn't right. I didn't have in the camp registered DP camp. My friends went to a city close by, a bigger city. Ginzburg or Ulm. And I went to say good-bye to them. I didn't have my identification card \u2014 identification on me from the DP camp already, American DP camp. They picked me up in that, in that truck, three soldiers. Here, you go in that truck.

Not enough I have to be with prostitutes after the war?\" I should \u2014 it was a court, the court made a, you know, case out of it. And $50 fine, I said, \"Well, where would I get $50?\" $50 is like $50,000 to a person who doesn't have five cents. I said, \"I can't give you $50. I don't have money.\" So one man from the group said, \"I bail you out.\" In the, in the, in the jail, they gave you a glass of grass with water, that was the soup. On the floor, you could sleep.

I need wood.\" He went to the wood with \u2014 where is wood, you know, forest. Cut the wood off \u2014 cut the tree off, and carried it with other soldiers to my house. Cut it to pieces, I was warm. That\u2019s Comm\u2014 American \u2014 the Russian soldiers. But they were always drunk. They sung on the street, doctor or a peasant, equally the same. They were drunk and drunk and drunk. And then \u201cYou have a watch? Davai chasi.\u201d\u201d Chasi is a watch. They said, \"Give me the watch. Davai chasi.\" They put it here on elbow from top till down, like kids; they never had a watch in Russia. So suddenly, \u201cdavai chasi,\u201d that means give me your watch. They didn't wait, they just grabbed and took it off of your hands and put them on. And then they threw them away like kids; that was funny to me, very funny \u2014 how they had them. But they didn't want to go back. They said, \"Why should I go back to my country? I don't have a family there left. They are all bombed out. I'm not going back.\" But there came the order three times, they have to go back otherwise they are in Siberia. And one man who is 10 years 1n prison, Miklos that was his name. Forgot his name, Miklos*\u2019. Maybe it will come back to me. He was from the democratic regime in Hungary, put to jail because he was a Communist for 10 years. And then he became in charge, so what did he do? He killed people, and everybody could see hanging on the street, in the big street in Budapest \u2014 on Andrassy ut. Hanging people, you pass by, you didn't think anything of it. You took everything such in stride, I don't know. You didn't think anything after the war that man is hanging. You saw so many on the mountains piled up, so you just pass and didn't think anything of it. And then maybe you expected that he was 10 years suffering in jail, that he wouldn't be so sympathetic to the people. It was \u2014 after the war was still misery. No 42 bread (Russian) 45 Matyas Rakosi food, even for everyone. Not only for the Jewish people now \u2014 equally. Couldn't get anything in the stores. They were all empty. No food, what I mean just to survive. Sometimes the water was pumped out. You had to travel miles to get a little water, probably."

The boat was an army boat, the Ernie Pyle and water came in the boat. So we had to change the direction. It took us three weeks to come United States.

So I was looking how to make the most, and that was jealousy many times. One woman said, \"Yesterday a woman was here. She was much worse than you are, and they hired her.\" But they let me go because the forelady didn't want me. And then in Budapest where I was working one time, I made a hat, designed all by myself. And that design hat went all over the country, had orders. And the woman said, \"Cut off a certain part of the head. It should be better.\" I said, \"Don't cut if off. It's perfect as it is.\" \"No, you do it.\" So then the forelady comes in, and she said, \"Who killed that hat?\" And she told it's me. She didn't took it on herself because the forelady told me to correct it. I wanted to leave the store. That was the European. But there was jealousy in jobs. As a foreigner, that what I noticed. But I work at many places, they were sympathetic with me. They want me to come Saturday to work if I want money, even it's not right but I should come. Many places I was lucky. I didn't notice any anti- Semitism while I was working. I made friends while I was working, good friends. I didn't have that problem with them, just the jealousy was more a problem. What I noticed.

I'm not going back to misery again. I don't want to go on rations.\" And so then he married and I married, too. Oh, my brother lived in Washington, had a little store. And I lived in New York, so I came to visit him. And I was helping him like a European sister, cleaning his jewelry and washing his floor, washing his windows. Like at home. And aman came in, three customers, and they said if I am single, they have a man for me. And I was talking on the telephone, he's a musician, a friend from Europe, from Brno where my sister was. And he belonged to my sister's congregation. When he was 13, he already played violin, he's a violinist. And I was talking to him, I was always very happy to talk to him. So anyway, he said they have a man for me, and I said, \"Okay, so let me meet him.\" To me \u2014 my brother had a date with a girl, I said, \"I'm not going with you on your date. I need a man for myself.\" Just not to be with him, not to spoil his date. So then my husband I met in his cousin's place, 1n his brother-in- law's. My husband didn't want to come to my brother's place, but he said he was going to his brother\u2019s \u2014 brother-in-law's brother liquor store in Washington. I said, \"Okay, he's not coming here. Iam going there.\" So my husband came, then he took me to his brother \u2014 he's a lawyer in Fairfax, he was. Now, he's old and sick. Burstein, Robert Burstein. And they thought I would be good for him, you know, for his brother. So in five days, he wanted to marry me. He was a very set man, he always knew what he wants to do \u2014 what want to do. And I felt like he's very reliable and character is great, and I don't meet a man every day like that. So it took me five months to make up my mind. In January '51, we got married.

But that was punish your kids, in the name of God, you know, that they should listen to you. I didn't like it. I was already not ready for that kind of treatment, you know, I didn't like it. And then German, he taught me. And he played chess, he taught me. He made chess and he played chess. He was a gabbai*\u00ae in the synagogue. You know, like a president in the synagogue. And he was a respectable man because the honor, the name, if you are a rabbi's daughter, he is a rabbi's \u2014 a kvittel [ed comment: a kivttel- rabbi\u2019s family] of rabbis. He came from that Loew, that big, golem family who made the golem. Kind of he related that he comes from that family. Loew, in Prague, Rabbi Loew. And he created that golem? and he came from that big, big family. So they got respect \u2014 and he was a teacher before he \u2014 when he got married at 19 years old.

She always stressed money 1s \u2014 name 46 sexton (Hebrew) is more worth it than money, all the time. Like gold, you know, that kind of Talmud. And once she says she studied the book, and once she told me I was amazed; I was already a woman. And she says that birds communicate. And I said, \"Where did you got it from?\" She said it is already in the Talmud book interpretation. And she studied a lot, and she took every day a newspaper and shared it with the neighbor, who had no money to buy it alone. But she had to have the paper. And hardworking existence, I don't think so she lived. Eight children. Eight children, no father, but everybody when they grow up, congratulated my mother, how great the kids are. She didn't do anything for them. One was a maid in a rich place, \u2014 an aunt\u2019s place \u2014 and another was a maid in arich place. My uncle came to pick me up so I can study hats in his place. His daughter was a millinery. I became a millinery. But they didn't register me for a year, sooner so I should work free. For three years, you had to pay if you study any trade. And after three years, you get paid. So they didn't register \u2014 I worked four years, instead of three years. But it was a good experience for me, they had a very disciplined, happy life, and I didn't have it at home. So then my father died, and I cried day and night when I was young. I slept on the floor. I was homesick when I went to that place, and sit on one place for 12 hours. Somebody died in the community, I had to make the hat with her overnight. I was 13. I had to be up the whole night, make that hat. It would be against the law if it's in this country, but I did it. And you had breakfast, a cup of coffee and a slice of bread. Lunch, a good lunch, but I could have three lunches, I was so hungry. And then you have 7 o'clock dinner: a slice of bread with a cup of coffee. There now, I was hungry. That wasn't \u2014 but I always prayed to God he should make me not only independent, I shouldn't need anyone. I should have my bread and water. That's all I want, I don't want more.
