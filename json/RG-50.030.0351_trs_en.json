We should come to the bunker how everybody had to be curfew and bombs were hitting the city constantly. And in a certain hour or a certain time, they were announcing each day, when we have to go in the bunker. Bunker, you know what 1s a bunker? So we went in the bunker one time tn the length of three months. Didn't go out, didn't go in. And one girl says, \"I can't stand it,\" a young woman. I just see her in front of my mind. \"I have to get water.\" \"Don't go, don't go, sweetheart.\" Bombs hit her and she never came back. Just for water, but she wanted to go there. But it was just such a critical time, people are \u2014 and that bunker life three months, unbelievable. Three months in one place, one seven-story building. And one day I am standing in front of the building \u2014 occasionally, I \u2014 she lived, we lived on the first floor \u2014 occasionally, we went up to the first floor. Not permitted, everybody had to be downstairs, but since it was first floor, so we went up. And I am standing in front of the window, and the bomb hit the whole building and that little window with my friend. Scattered bombs you know and all windows are broken. And we are here like a miracle. Nothing happened to both of us. And we couldn't eat; we had no place to go. The stores were closed and bombed out. You could steal \u2014 they didn't call it stealing. We had to work for it. Confiscating or something. Confiscating, but not stealing. And they had ice cream cones, so I took ice cream cones and put water in it.

They didn't raise, we didn't hear any screaming, didn't have any help from anyplace, and we felt very, very bad about it, angry. We were angry. Simply very, very angry that we can sit in nice warm place, and I\u2019m starving and freezing to death, had no shoes. One hole was snow and the other one went out the snow. So it was anger and such hopelessness. Can't do anything for them. And when I saw those people, I said, \"Thank God. What do I have to complain? I'm vacationing.\" That's the way I felt.

And he gave him a paper that he requests from the National Printing Office, identification cards for laborers to work in a factory \u2014 in a munitions factory.

Divided the time they shouldn't be all at one time there. He said he saw everybody, he told me that he saw everybody who's coming in. But he was there incognito, they shouldn't see him; he was hiding behind in the back somehow. And I went there three times. I don't want to tell you how scared I was each time to go in. And the fourth time \u2014I got three times, okay, 500 and 500 \u2014 and the fourth time, they wouldn't give me it. But I noticed that they want to call the policeman on me, the Nazis, so I run out.

You know, you could take and nobody would bother you. But after a while, the law came that you cannot steal or take anything anymore, so what we did \u2014 there was no food, no stores, no place to go shopping, after the war. The only great thing was you had freedom. You could breathe, and I thought that's best in the world what you can get after \u2014 that we are alive. So I went to see that man [Tibor] who was that friend who was alive. My Christian lady [landlady] took me to him, and I was happy that he's still alive. We didn't know anything. And he took over an office, a doctor's office because he had two years of medicine already. And he said it's horrible, no drugs, and he had to take the bombs \u2014 the shrapnel out of people. Cold freezing hospitals. No heat and no drugs. He said it's a horrible, horrible condition. So while he was going to hospital, curing the people, and if he saw somebody's very sick even before, he took his identifications away and gave it to someone else. I was waiting for food. Kitchens on the streets for everyone. But from the morning to the night I could wait for a cup of soup. I waited, and I got his soup and luckily and he could be in the hospital. But after a while, we decided we are going to Szeged, plenty food, another city \u2014 a doctors\u2019 university. So he went to enroll to the doctor, finish, and I was staying there till I wouldn't be hungry anymore. Once they got me, the policeman, I had wanted to sell. But they didn't put me in jail. You know, they just took away my blackmail \u2014 or black market. There it was already food plenty. Plenty food in Szeged. Then I wanted to see who's at home in Trebisov. I knew it's a magic, if somebody will come back.  02:44:27 I didn't want to dream. I still \u2014 I took a train overnight, three weeks on the top of the train and I traveled. And Red Cross occasionally stopped the train and gave us soup or something, so in three weeks I came home traveling on the top of the roof. Soldiers went home. The soldiers didn't want to go back to Russia. They got an order if you're not coming three times. If you're not coming on the third order, you will be sent to Siberia. So then they went back on the same train what I went on the top of the train. And I came home and, of course, there 1s \u2014 we owned a house and a restaurant, and my mother still owed money on that building. So I stayed till I could make \u2014 pay off the house. So I was dreaming, I wasn't believe it that somebody's coming back, they should have at least a place. So I went in my house, they hit me, why I didn't stay with the \u2014 why I didn't die with the Nazis, because the Christian woman took over. She was one time a maid in my mother's place, so she lives now in my building, in my house. It was a nice house. And she hit me, and I wanted, you know, sentimental things what I could out from there, so I took a policeman and we went back. She hit me again in front of him. Such a\u2014 soaked over Communism \u2014 I mean, Nazism. Everybody was a Nazi. One boy who hit my brother, gave him to the policeman, he says while I was there \u2014 stopped me on the street, he said: \"I wanted to save your brother.\" Gosh, I was so mad at him. I was so mad. I went to the office, I said, \"How come you still have that man free?\" So he says, \"We have a new Bible. If somebody hits you on one side, you give him the other side.\" I said, \"It's good that you didn't build a monument for the killers here.\" But then I left, I didn't \u2014I stayed till I..."

She made, she went.  So when she came to the United States after years, lucky, she studied in that dressmaker design school, and she became a very good dressmaker. So you could make yourself anything you wanted to in that camp, if you wanted to. But I didn't feel like I wanted \u2014 life was very, very limited and simple. But you had friends it was such a tight together. You know, like you're my brother, you're my sister. You didn't feel like strange person there, 1t was one whole big family. If you see a man, you didn't look at him like a man. But you looked and, \u201cOh, my gosh, thank God he's here. That's my brother.\u201d If you didn't have any \u2014 you know if you didn't feel like a man. But it was all \u2014 or a sister or anybody, you had such a unity. And life was very, very simple, and those people really didn't have too much strength to do anything more \u2014 they went to eat. You went to lunch, get the dinner that little rations, what they got. In the morning, breakfast, a little cereal, tiny milk, and that was it. You were hungry constantly even with the rations you got, you got there. But many people managed some way to make money. Some way that they wouldn't have to be hungry. But from that rations, you had to be hungry. You didn't have to starve to death, but it wasn't enough. And then the clothing, you could get free. So you didn't have any worries how you get a dress, and rooms were free, of course. One room we were four people in. My cousin and me and her brother and a little strange boy. It was nothing unusual to have a strange man in that room, or Nazis or with numbers or \u2014 I mean survivors. It was nothing unusual. It was just accepted thing that girl \u2014 not scared \u2014 man, no man wasn't such thing in that time. She was Orthodox, my cousin. She is still, and it wasn't a difference. Not supposed to be in the same room according to the \u2014 you know, regulations, Jewish. But was no difference, and courses, they emphasized Hebrew courses very much."

That was good. But it was very depressing waiting three years. And tomorrow, they promise you tomorrow the quota, and you come tomorrow and a year later. Six months later, three months later, and it was always one year, two years, three years. For me it was 'til 1947. It wasn't right. I didn't have in the camp registered DP camp. My friends went to a city close by, a bigger city. Ginzburg or Ulm. And I went to say good-bye to them. I didn't have my identification card \u2014 identification on me from the DP camp already, American DP camp. They picked me up in that, in that truck, three soldiers. Here, you go in that truck. Took me to jail. Can you imagine how strict that was before? American soldiers did it to me; put me with the prostitutes in Ulm in the jail. Next day, I said, \"How could you do that to me? Not enough I have to be with prostitutes after the war?\" I should \u2014 it was a court, the court made a, you know, case out of it. And $50 fine, I said, \"Well, where would I get $50?\" $50 is like $50,000 to a person who doesn't have five cents. I said, \"I can't give you $50. I don't have money.\" So one man from the group said, \"I bail you out.\" In the, in the, in the jail, they gave you a glass of grass with water, that was the soup. On the floor, you could sleep.

I was hungry. There was nothing to eat, no place to shop. And I went \u2014 I knew that they have a big truck with bread. I said, \"I am hungry. Give me chleba*\u2019.\" I speak Slavic, you know, I speak Slovakian. I said, \"Davai chleba. Give me bread.\" They didn't ask me who I am. I said, \"I am freezing in my room. I need wood.\" He went to the wood with \u2014 where is wood, you know, forest. Cut the wood off \u2014 cut the tree off, and carried it with other soldiers to my house. Cut it to pieces, I was warm. That\u2019s Comm\u2014 American \u2014 the Russian soldiers. But they were always drunk. They sung on the street, doctor or a peasant, equally the same. They were drunk and drunk and drunk. And then \u201cYou have a watch? Davai chasi.\u201d\u201d Chasi is a watch. They said, \"Give me the watch. Davai chasi.\" They put it here on elbow from top till down, like kids; they never had a watch in Russia. So suddenly, \u201cdavai chasi,\u201d that means give me your watch. They didn't wait, they just grabbed and took it off of your hands and put them on. And then they threw them away like kids; that was funny to me, very funny \u2014 how they had them. But they didn't want to go back. They said, \"Why should I go back to my country? I don't have a family there left. They are all bombed out. I'm not going back.\" But there came the order three times, they have to go back otherwise they are in Siberia. And one man who is 10 years 1n prison, Miklos that was his name. Forgot his name, Miklos*\u2019. Maybe it will come back to me. He was from the democratic regime in Hungary, put to jail because he was a Communist for 10 years. And then he became in charge, so what did he do? He killed people, and everybody could see hanging on the street, in the big street in Budapest \u2014 on Andrassy ut. Hanging people, you pass by, you didn't think anything of it. You took everything such in stride, I don't know. You didn't think anything after the war that man is hanging. You saw so many on the mountains piled up, so you just pass and didn't think anything of it. And then maybe you expected that he was 10 years suffering in jail, that he wouldn't be so sympathetic to the people. It was \u2014 after the war was still misery.
