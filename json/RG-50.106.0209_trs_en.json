But absolutely no, no what you call t he love they had for the Jews. As far as the Polack goes, they did not change and I tell you an experience , what happened to me in the year 2000 when I went to Poland and I wanted my family, my sister and my niece and my nephew and my niece they wanted to see where their parents were born. Because they w ere not alive anymore . My sisters. So what happened? We took a trip to Poland and I speak Polish, of course. And as we came to Poland, they wanted to see the apartment that we lived in. So sure enough I come into the apartment. I brought a box of candy. I figured I want to be nice and polite. And I knocked on the door. The place we lived in. and the next thing is, a woman opened up the door and it was a small room. And I said where is the apartment? They said they divided the apartment in two. The other half is on the other side. Interview with David Schnitzer 9 July 17, 2013 Ok so I wanted to show the bigger apartment because this was one big apartment. So sure enough, I knock on the door of the other apartment. The woman opens up the door. The husband a big bull with a moustache stands in the back and he says, shows with the hand, no, no. You can\u2122t come in here. And I says to the woman, look here. We came 3000 miles. All I do. I don\u2122t want your apartment. All I came here to show my niece , my nephew, where they live, what and my sons, my sons were with me too. To show where I was born and where their mothers was born. No way. He\u2122s not, not me into the apartment and I took that and I said look here. I didn\u2122t come for the apartment. I didn\u2122t want to argument because I was afraid. He could take a knife and stab me and kill me so I walked away. So just wanted to show you how they did not change, no matter how publicity and how tried, still and all they\u2122re still the same Polacks they were. One vice -- one prime minister in Israel said they minute they were born, they soaked in anti -Semitism in their mother\u2122s milk."

They all came and the Jewish mothers came in f or the sabbath . They bought chickens, they bought the eggs and they bought everything else. Now the Jewish people had stores around town and I guess all kind of stores , like suits and clothes and materials and so on and so on. So the Polacks, the farmers, they had the money and they figured they had nothing in their farms. They go into the Jewish stores and they buy what you call it, the clothes and they make themselves clothes and they buy shoes and so and so on. The antiSemit es were standing right and outside the stores. They saw the Polacks coming out with packages from the store and says go back to the store. Tell the Jew to give you the money back.

Th ey all come out from the churches with the Madonnas, with the pictures and the Marys and they walk down the streets and there will be riots. So the Jews had to stand out, stay out of the streets and stay home. Because they were afraid they should not atta ck the Jews . So just shows you what Poland was like before the war.

            "answer": "Annaberg. I was there about two or three years til the camp was completely liquidated. And after this I think less than three years. And the camp was liquidated because they send out most of the people, they sent to Auschwitz. And the people who remained, they had to close up the camp and they sent us to a different camp. They sent us to a camp by the name of Graditz . I don\u2122t know how far it was. Walking distance. So we had to walk to Graditz. And we came to Graditz. We had the same thing we did in Blechhammer. We were cutting woods and carrying woods and carrying and so on and so on. The condition s were horrible and people were dying right and left. Cond \u0152 they what you call it. The health problem was so bad that people collected what you call it, became no water, no soap, no nothing so people could not wash or clean and we were so filthy so ever ybody had lice. So lice developed typhus, so everybody was sick with Interview with David Schnitzer 26 July 17, 2013 typhus. And the camp, nobody could do anything because they close up the camp because the camp was full of typhus. We have 1200 people there. And we were living on the bridges one, two a nd three on straw and people were hallucinating because the temperature went down. No medication, no water, no nothing. People were dying right and left. As I was laying, the next thing is that moved over to my right side and sure enough the man was dead. I pushed him over and the next thing is the man on my left side, the same thing happened. They pushed over his, to my side and sure enough he was dead. I myself was sick with typhus. I had a high temperature. I don\u2122t know how I made it out. So we had from 1200 people, 200 people survived. And from the 200 people we could hardly walk. We could hardly do anything. So what happened is we had to take out all the bodies who were laying there. We had to bring them to the yard and, and people were digging a big pit and they threw it into the pits and they closed it up and they put what you call it all kind of the infections on top of it, that the infections shouldn\u2122t go. The Germans would never walk into it because they didn\u2122t want to get typhus. And after we survived, 200 people, we could hardly walk. And the next thing is they had to close the camp because the camp has nobody to be working. So they had to send us back to another camp. So we walked about a whole day to another camp, the last camp was named Langen bielau. Langenbielau was a camp what the Germans w here making air force parts, for the air, for the German air force. So what happened. The machineries were all by Germans and since they were losing the war almost so they needed all the Germans to go to fight for the war. So they took away all the Germans, all these machineries, all the people who worked on the machines and they took us and we should go and they teached us how to run the machines. So we h ad to take over their machinery and they sent them away to the front lines, to the Russian lines. So we worked there for \u0152 came in. And we were of course surrounded by SS guards and the camp was surrounded by electric wires and so on. And now that we worked there in camp and the rations were terrible. Same thing, but we survived somehow. Very few people going and coming. People dropped dead. So what happened was the Germans wanted to sa ve bullets. They let them die in the street. some kind of rumors that they\u2122re losing the war. We didn\u2122t know what was up. Interview with David Schnitzer 27 July 17, 2013"

You want me to work now after I was spent so many years slavery and so on. Oh. He said listen and you go back to the town, the first thing you got to do register with the military. You hear this.

He had a motorcycle. And a motorcycle. How come he got a motorcycle? His aunt was a communist before the war. And after the war they rewarded a motorcycle. The Polish government.

So we decided not to stay, not to go back and we decided to stay and wait until we bring them over to us. So we were staying what you call it in, in the DP camp and they were in P oland. And they were in Poland. My sister and my mother and my sister got married in Poland to a Jewish man. And sure enough he, at that time, Poland allowed people to have a little business. So he had a little business. And she went off. They did not al low the Jews to leave. Interview with David Schnitzer 34 July 17, 2013 And then it came an order and so my mother was elderly and she could leave. Well what happened was so we arranged for somebody to sponsor my mother to America. But since my mother was crippled from the war. She could not walk so she wouldn\u2122t be able to get a visa to come to America. So we decided maybe she cannot. They will allow her to come in. So we had a woman, somebody who sponsored her as a maid to come back to Canada. So she went off. She got the papers and meantime, as sh e go in for the papers. She was in Paris. She was in Paris at transit and she was in Paris for over a year waiting to go in. And in Paris, in the meantime, she was waiting. And finally she went in to Canada. She went to Canada. She was living there in ver y harsh conditions. They were, the climate was bad and everything was bad. I couldn\u2122t go there. Nobody could go there because we were not citizens. I mean I tell you how come we came to America later. So what happened was that she was living in Montreal Canada. And Poland decided that Jews can leave, not to America, no place else but to Palestine. At that time it wasn\u2122t Israel , was Palestine . So sure enough my brother in law and my sister picked their selves up and they went to Palestine. As they went to P alestine my mother had a chance to bring them over to Canada because mothers could bring in siblings back to their country. So mother arranged it and she brought over my brother in law and my sister to Canada. And they remained in Canada and they died in C anada."

In America the civil rights are not taken away completely . They still have courts, they still have judges. They still have something. You cannot just throw it out. You s till have a chance to go into a court house and claim your Interview with David Schnitzer 50 July 17, 2013 case. I didn\u2122t have th is case. I never did. I could never go complain. I told you. I went to the teacher. He beat me up. You know what she told me. It didn\u2122t kill you. I mean this is the answer I get. Now how could I go and complain to anybody. You\u2122re talking about the civil rights here. No comparison. I don\u2122t say they don\u2122t have their, they shouldn\u2122t have a civil right. They are entitled to all kind of things but to say that\u2122s not discrimination. I would say definitely there is. You still go. There is a woman here. She was a cook on tv and they fired here because she mentioned the word and that was the end of it. I mean it just shows you that it\u2122s still here, but the thing is people still can complain about it. And that\u2122s the results and that\u2122s what happened. If you, if you come and out of the line then you going to be punished in a way, manually or prison, one or the other. You can\u2122t get away with something like this because it\u2122s still a democratic country. A civilized country. Peo ple still listen to you. Peo ple still go a fter you. I mean if you have some problems or so on. I did not have these kind of rights. So that\u2122s why I love the United States. I like the constitution. I\u2122m a good honest citizen. I follow all the rules and regulations because I love this country. This country gave me a home. This country made me a citizen. I am entitled to all kind of things that the people of the United States are. I can even run for office if I wanted to. I\u2122m a little bit too late , the age. S o I can\u2122t do it anymore ."

And before I became a citizen I had to know my senators are, who the court house is. What the Supreme Court is. How the constitution works and I had to bring two witnesses to testify in favor of me that I am here and who I am and so on, so on. And today you don\u2122t have it any more. They have a lot of immigrants that they came over, illegally and o vernight they want to become citizens. I think that\u2122s wrong. I don\u2122t believe \u0152 I went through five years to be a honest citizen, to become a citizen. I think that everybody should have the same kind of thing what I did. It shouldn\u2122t go when you come in, you go through the door and I want to be a citizen . I mean this country would be in ruins if this is the case. Every hoodlum is going to come in and overnight he will become a citizen. But that I knock them in some way. They should work.

It\u2122s a very important thing for future generations to find out because things will be forgotten. It\u2122s a couple of years we die out. We\u2122re not here anymore and what, how else, how else would history be continued without having these kind of conversation of mine and from different people and films and so on. B ecause as you see it year after year, less and less people talk about the Holocaust. The only time is the agencies and people like they were the Washingt on Memorial and so on but otherwise you can see day in and day out less and less people think about it and there are a lot of deniers that it never happened. You go into Iran, they deny it ever happened. You go into the Arab countries, it\u2122s just a Jew propaganda. It never happened. I mean how can you talk to people if they don\u2122t even understand that things do, did happen because you don\u2122t deal to, in democratic countries. You deal with animals all over. They only have one religion which is Moslem and that \u2122s all they believe in. The Jews have no right to live . The Jews have no right to exist. They come from pigs. They come from animals and so on. This is how they talk. So how can you talk to these people.
