She spoke English, she was planning to study medicine somewhere overseasoverseas in the West, not in Poland. She had a lot of friends. She helped us a lot from '41 to '43. She worked; life was very difficult. And after our ghetto was liquidated, we were hiding immediately, and she was walking in the city, in the camp. It was not a concentration camp per se but it was a working camp. Jews and Poles work there. You ask me why she was there? She could have escaped with us but she was trying to retrieve some things for us to be able to continue hiding and living, etcetera. Me and my mother and my sister were hiding at that time inby Poles, outside the city, and I used to go to visit her. I remember I visited her twice or three times. She couldn't visit us.

Unfortunately for them, they didn't survive thereno, unfortunately for them, they survived but they came back in '41. They came back because my parents, many people around spoke about them very highly, positively, and they wrote to the Russian government that they were not for Bourgeois who exploit other people.

And this was whenbut then we went to school and I don't knowwe were happy with the minimum that we have. But if we would go to Polandfirst of all, life in Poland for Jews was much better. I'm sorry. And from Poland, as we learned later, we could be trying to go to Czechoslovakia, to Vienna, to Israel, because Russia was close. Poland wasand besides, the Poles closed their eyes when Jews left also from Poland. My aunt, with her two sons, left for Poland in order for them to avoid the Army. In Poland, they were + because they were of draft age. So they left for Czechoslovakia, and from there to Germany. I don't know if it you know the story, that this wasprobably the Israelis arranged those things for them, I don't know. But they left Poland after one year of being in Poland. It was a pogrom in Krakow, too, so Poland was also not the best place to be. But compared to Russia, was a wonderful place. And we lived in Russia until '57."
