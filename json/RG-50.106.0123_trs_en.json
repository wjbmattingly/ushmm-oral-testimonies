Hate does not exist in our society as far as the Jewish people is, because we [indecipherable] from history, the only thing we teach is remember. Because if I hate somebody, is only hurts me. It doesn\u2122t hurt the other party. He doesn\u2122t know and he doesn\u2122t care. So people were so surprised that I don\u2122t hate. No, I have a German girl, works in a \u0152 an office that I used to be on the board in there and we became very good friends. And she knows that, that I don\u2122t hate her. A matter of fact, her boss is a German Jew, and \u0152 and he accepted her, cause she is a very nice person. She was a young girl, she must have been about 12 \u0152 13 years old. She could have been respon sible, something with her father or \u0152 or grandfather, or uncle, or whatever it is. So you can\u2122t hate everybody. And like I said, there was many good Germans too.

So it was threaten, and let\u2122s face it, that goes the same way like was in Russia. Your family was in jeopardy if you said someth ing against the government, the same way in any other country. So I would say there was many that, like I said, in our hometown, when we worked with the army, which was army, German army, they were not hateful, they were not bad. They never touched us, never. And they told us that they don\u2122t want to join the SS because they are nothing but murderers."
