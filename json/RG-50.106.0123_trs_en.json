It doesn\u2019t hurt the other party. He doesn\u2019t know and he doesn\u2019t care. So people were so surprised that I don\u2019t hate. No, I have a German girl, works in a \u2014 an office that I used to be on the board in there and we became very good friends. And she knows that, that I don\u2019t hate her. A matter of fact, her boss is a German Jew, and \u2014 and he accepted her, cause she is a very nice person. She was a young girl, she must have been about 12 \u2014 13 years old.
