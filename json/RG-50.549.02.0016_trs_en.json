            "answer": "A few simple words? Leo Bretholz is my name and recording Holocaust stories is my game. Although, I like to stay away from it, base -- I never bring up the subject when we sit. It\u2019s not -- I\u2019m not a -- a dweller on -- on the -- on the events. I don\u2019t exult in the word survivor, because that, to me, is almost like a -- become an object of -- of curiosity. Those who are no longer here, they are the real people that should be paid attention to. Because if we don\u2019t remember them, you know, we\u2019 ll kill them all over again. But the word survivor to me connotes something that\u2019s always a -- a special group and you know, when I speak to people and then they say, \u201cDo you have a number?\u201d I say, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have a number, because if I were -- had been in a position to get a number, chances are 99 or 999 out of 1000 that I wouldn\u2019t be speaking to you here. So once I don\u2019t have the number, I am no longer that object of curiosity and I\u2019m losing some- I\u2019m lo-losing some credibility, you know. They want to hear that oh, you\u2019re in Auschw -- well, if you\u2019re in Auschwitz, you\u2019re not here to tell the story. Some of them are, but the majority of them are not. It\u2019s enough that I escaped from a train and even that was -- in that train out of -- out of 1000, only seven -- out of 1000, 773 were gassed on arrival. So, even that is sort of a -- a -- a percentage to -- to -- to be -- to be taken into consideration, you know, so anyway. Now I said more than what you wanted me to say."

            "question": "Let me make sure I\u2019m getting all this on tape. I want to begin with talking about the events, maybe the weeks or days leading up to the end of the war and where you were and what you were doing.",
            "answer": "Well, the end of the -- the days of the end of the war, after I had lived through the liberation in France. Paris was liberated on the 25th of August, 1944. And then the war ended in *45. I was still in France and originally I had papers to come to the United States in 1941, but that was negated by the fact that there was Pearl Harbor and the Americans [indecipherable] entered the war. So, the papers that I had then, which was the affidavit of support, which we got from our relatives here, that expired. And of course after that, I went through all my adventures to deportation and the escape and the jail and everything. But in *45, at the end of the war, I was in France and was awaiting the documents that my aunt, who lived in Baltimore sent me, which is an affidavit of support, at the end of 1946, I received my visa of entry into the United States. And in January of 1947, the 19th of January 1947, I went to LeHavre in France and took the John Erikkson to the United State, a 10 days crossing. And I arrived in New York on the 29th of January, 1947, which is now a little over 51 years. To some people, a lifetime, to me it flew by just like this and it\u2019s hardly to be believed, that\u2019s 51 years have gone by, yes. So I was in France at the end of the -- of -- of the war and came to the United States there. At that point, I didn\u2019t know yet what had happened to my family, although the -- the indications were quite ominous that a tragedy had happened, because we knew already what had happened on the camps and I knew that my mother -- hadn\u2019t heard since \u201842. So that was, to me, an indication. So I came to United States, I -- I was then s-still ignorant of the fact what happened to my mother and sisters."

            "question": "I'd like to ask you about that in -- in a little bit, but do you recall -- I think I re-recall reading something about liberation day and you were in a town in France where they were -- German soldiers were being led through town?",
            "answer": "Yeah, that\u2019s in the book, also. That is in my book, the book will come out at the end of this year -- towards the end of the year now. Probably November of 1998 and the book will be called, \u201cLeap into Darkness - Seven Years on the Run in Wartime Europe\u201d\u2019. It\u2019s co-written by my good friend Michael Oleska, the -- actually, he was the -- he motivated me to write it and then he was editing it f-for me and we did mutual project, was -- it went very well. Taught me a lot and gave me an opportunity. But, at the end of the war, in Limoge, I was in Limoge. That\u2019s where I was when France was liberated. And the garrison, the German oc -- the German garrison in Limoge was not the same as it had been before June of 1944, because some of them were sent to the war front. The landing in Normandy took place on the sixth of June. And on the 10th of June was the burning of the village of Orodure, to which I was a -- almost witness, because I was on my way there and got off the train when I saw a German transport going there and I didn\u2019t want to go into the same direction. That village was burned to the ground and all it\u2019s inhabitants, except a few, burned with the village. And I was just about maybe 10 - 15 miles away from them. Everyone that had a ticket for Orodure, to get off, which I had -- was taken into station, was part of that massacre. So there again, I was lucky in a great, great way. You see, my escape is not so much survival and -- and that\u2019s why I say I don\u2019t exult in it. It\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a question of -- of fear and luck. The fear is the motivater and then you got to be lucky for -- for it to succeed or to -- to get away. So, that was just -- before the liberation, after the liberation, we had these -- the remnant of the German garrison in -- in- in Limoge. They were taken down the main street, down towards the station by a ragtag outfit of the resistance, whom the Germans considered dispensable, just a few weeks earlier. And here, this ragtag outfit that didn\u2019t have matching shoes, had the nerve. Anything to -- to -- to -- to hold on to basically, except their pride and their joy that the -- now, the war -- the end of the war came. Those Germans acted like little sheep, you know. Their -- a few weeks earlier they were the masters and at that moment they walked with their hands on top of their heads and looking scared. Why? Because they\u2019re human beings. And some of them were young. I mean they were in the hands of these underground people and they knew that these undergrounds had a bone to pick with them. They knew that wh-wh-wh-when we are in their hands, we are not in the hands of - of a -- of -- of an enemy\u2019s ha -- high command, where they have to deal with -- with protocol and war amenities. The amenities of exchanging and of fairness, imprisonment. These -- these underground, th-the -- the resistance, they were bent on -- on vengeance."

            "answer": "I -- I was -- I was not -- I -- I was a member of the -- of the Sixth. The -- the Sixth was a group that was engaged in clandestine performances, like doing false identification cards and -- and documents. We did that already, before the liberation. But, we were all under a -- taking orders. Some were connected with the FTPF, they were called. In French it\u2019s Front Tereur Partisain Francais. Front tereur means snipers or guerrillas. Partisain -- partisans, you know. They were a tough -- oh, how do you say it? Rough, rock and tumble outfit. They didn\u2019t go by -- by orders or by command. There was another group was called FFI, the Force Francais L\u2019Interiore. The French Forces of the Interior. They took orders from DeGaulle in London. And there was this conflict between the two groups. The one wanted to go the -- the legal -- the -- the proper way. The other said, \u201cWe're going to get the enemy whichever way we can.\u201d So this -- this was the group. And under -- we were usually under these orders. But the partisans that arrested the Germans, they were the ones that had come out of the woods carrying their rifles. Some of the rifles -- most of the rifles were not loaded. But the rifle looked good and inspired -- if -- if -- if not fear, at least respect."

            "question": "Mm-hm. You -- you were feeling euphoric, yourself?",
            "answer": "Yeah, yeah. The mood was euphoric. And then with it came a sobering moment, mixed in with that euphoria. That while the war is finished, there are families somewhere from whom we hadn\u2019t heard. So, to us this was the beginning of a new chapter of finding out and searching. And being here dealing with things. When Paris was liberated, in \u201844 - in August \u00b044, we knew that Germany was not defeated yet. In fact, that same year, in the -- in the fall, came the Battle of the Bulge. And in that counter attack by the Germans, they advanced far enough for Paris to feel that there might be another -- a re-occupation. That never happened. The allies -- allies prevailed. But that was that moment. Germans were still kicking -- alive and kicking. And when the landing took place in \u201844, during that period, in June of \u201844, the deportations from southern France, from Vichy, France towards Drancy and Auschwitz were still going on. So even that euphoric moo-mood, about the landings, had to be tempered with -- with the knowledge that people are still being sent away. But then when -- when -- in 1945, in May of \u201845, the armistice was signed, there was a different attitude. Now, we knew that the war was ended and we had to deal with the aftermath. For many of us, that had to do with family, because we had left our families and loved ones and some of it -- some of them left with their families, but in the process of fleeing, of going to France and living on the Vichy, some of those fa-families had been separated. Young men were hiding out while their parents were deported. That happened quite often, you saw that in the movies with -- with \u201cAu revoir mes enfants\u201d and you had so many other things and -- and so in Freedman in the wrote -- the wro -- who wrote that book, \u201cWhen Memory Comes\u201d, he was taken to a convent and his parents were deported and never came back. And finally he got back to his Judaism, because he -- he was converted by the padres and -- no, bu -- bu -- no, he went to a -- not to a con -- he went to a monastery, I think. So anyway, we all had to deal with these things and knowing that the war was over was very good, but there was the family\u2019s story and the history of -- and the aspect of -- of dealing with it -- dealing with it from emotional standpoint because we -- we -- it was the great uncertainty, who had survived and who had not survived."

            "question": "And how did you go about beginning to deal with it?",
            "answer": "I tried to start searches. Red Cross and other venues and did actually not find out until 1962 what had happened. That was from \u201847 to \u201862, 15 years -- what happened to my mother and sisters, which is also in -- in the book. And how I dealt at the moment? At that moment I was -- in 1946, I was 25 years old, I had survived the war. I had received my papers to come to America. And frankly I was looking forward to getting away from the continent there. It had not been too kind to me, to say the least and of course, France, beautiful country. Countries are always beautiful, 1t\u2019s what the people do that\u2019s not so good, often, you know. But France to me was -- was a country that I wanted already to get away from because I had been in jail and I had been deported and I had been beaten up and so on. I -- I looked forward to coming to America, wh-where I knew I had family and start a new life. And that\u2019s what I was dealing with. I did not dwell too much on the fact that I better stay in Europe and try to find my mother and sisters, because I had reached out to Red Cross and other agencies and I never heard anything. And of course at that time, the communication system had not developed to the point where you knew who had survived, who had not survived. So I -- I wanted to be just getting away from there and I knew that staying there wouldn\u2019t advance anything from me emotionally, because I\u2019d only be still under the -- the impact of what happened to me. And I looked forward to make a break. And that\u2019s what happened. I came to the United States. I did not dwell too much on the sentimentality. [indecipherable] stay here and -- and -- and -- and - and f -- and fight it to the end, because the continent was no longer for me, you see? I wanted to get away from it."

            "answer": "I was in a -- on the Jo -- SS John Erikkson. I was -- I think about a 37 -- 37,000 ton former liberty ship. And it was a -- a January voyage. 80 percent of the ship got seasick. Most of us, while we were seasick, slept on deck, because in the cabins it was too -- the smell wasn\u2019t so good. There was -- with the disinfectant and so on. I -- it was a -- a-- a pleasant ship to be on. It had good food and a piano where one F-Frenchman was playing swing music. It\u2019s interesting -- was an interesting voyage. We were seasick and overnight the seasickness stopped, because we got into calm seas when we passed the Gulf Stream. So on the icicles that were hanging on the -- on the railing started melting and the waves were pretty high, I was one sitting there where this fella that played on the piano, he was a -- quite an artist. He improvised music and arrangements. Arrangements of popular tunes, especially American tunes. And there was a young lady, who was a war bride and she came to America to rejoin her fianc\u00e9. And these two fell in love. And then we landed in New York, Hoboken or Brooklyn. Never forget that scene. We landed in New York, she and that young man walked down the gangplank and her fianc\u00e9, the former GI and his folk were standing there with flowers to wait to -- to receive her. And this young man walked down with her, carrying her suitcase. And actually big suitcases were taken in by the porters for the customs, but these little handbags carrying something for her. And we observed that, because we were already aware of that, because that was the talk. She says, \u201cT don\u2019t know what to tell my fianc\u00e9.\u201d We were friends on that -- on that ship, you know, I have a few pictures that show us together. And then they walked down to her fianc\u00e9 and his folks and she says, \u201cI have to tell you that I fell in love on this ship and this is the man.\u201d I don\u2019t know what the words were that they exchanged there, but this was one of the scenes of that arriving -- arriving in America. There was one young lady who said she\u2019s going to Eagle Pass, Texas. A Parisian woman. Eagle Pass, Texas, that\u2019s at the Mexican border. I mean, this is an outpost where you -- where the cows walk in the streets and watermelons [indecipherable]. Well, with her I was 1n correspondence after I came here, for a few weeks or a couple months or so. And she wrote to me she doesn\u2019t know how to deal with that, but from Paris to Eagle Pass, she never knew that it would be this way. And then she -- she devised a -- a subterfuge where her mother was writing her a letter from Paris that the grandmother is very ill and is about to die. So she told her husband, he was her husband already, that she\u2019s going back to Paris, to the funeral of her grandmother. Later I found out that she wrote to him that she is not coming back to Eagle Pass. And [indecipherable], these are these spur of the moment situations where people in the war get together, fall in love, don\u2019t know what the future will be and then you transplant somebody from Paris to Eagle Pass, you\u2019re -- you\u2019re crossing a -- you\u2019re going in to -- all together different culture there."

My aunt, my father\u2019s sister, Aunt Sophie. And ma -- Aunt Minna and Uncle Sam, whom I had been with in Luxembourg after I escaped from Vienna. They had come here and my aunt was in the rag business, metal and iron, scrap metal and iron, but I never expected to be in that business and I came in January, lost my Uncle Sam, whom I loved very much. I came in the 29th of -- of January and in the middle of February he died. I hadn\u2019t had much chance to even tell him -- we had a chance, but not much chance to communicate about these years that had past, in between, in the interim. So, but -- end of February -- a month after I came here, I worked for Barnes Clothing, down on Baltimore Street and was my first job and I joined the textile company. Some people say I should have gone to college and furthered my education. Which would have been alright if \u2019'd had enough money to pay rent. At first I stayed with my relatives, then I moved in with a friend of mine. Rented a -- a room in a place -- a little apartment. Didn\u2019t want to be a burden to my relatives all the time. So -- but I worked for a textile firm, starting in 1947 til the early 60\u2019s. And my goal in America was to -- to live a -- a normal life and -- and to make a living, you know. That\u2019s not -- no great ambitions or -- or great aspirations other than settle down and -- and quietly. I was a good salesman, I turned out to be a pretty good salesman and made a good living working for the textile firm and later did other things. But th -- the first few months in America were also not entirely satisfactory as far as my daily life was concerned. Number one, the death of my uncle affected me very much. And the change from France to America is also a culture shock. Then came the very hard winter in -- in -- 1n \u201c47, was a hard winter, which is fine, but then the very hot summers in Baltimore, which were very oppressive for me, I cannot tolerate the heat too much. And before you know it, I was into the hay fever problem, which I did not have in -- in Europe. So the first year in America, I had second thoughts and the correspondence I had with my aunt in Paris and with some of the friends was that there is a possibility I may come back. In the back of my head, there was also still -- and that I couldn\u2019t help -- the idea of my mother and sisters. And in America I was far away from it, so the combination of not quite acclimating immediately to the American culture and the climate, plus the fact that I was still laboring with the thoughts of what had happened to my family, because this -- there was this guilt from the moment that I left them, in \u201838, although my mother urged me to leave."

So it was a little more difficult for me to -- back and forth, but I had to reassess this whole thing. And it didn\u2019t take long before I got acquainted with the language fully. I had some elementary school English knowledge. And I developed a circle of friends and once I started working, I became more involved in the daily life, acclimated in that respect. The language started to come easier and then when I started going on the road, I developed more and more of -- of a sense of what America means to me, because I like to travel aspect of meeting people and -- and earning a living, and --"

To me this was a shock. I had just gone through this thing with being Jewish and having to wear the yellow star, see? And we were told we are different. The Jew, the Nazis say, you can recognize a mile away. The way he acts, the way he talks, the way he behaves. He looks -- then comes my question.

I am the good black and you are the nigger. I found that out that that\u2019s discrimination among the groups themselves. Jews, blacks, Catholics, others. We all human beings. But, as soon -- I made up my mind that I will not keep quiet in the face of adversity or bigotry or prejudice, bias. Because I\u2019ve learned my lesson in Europe. Because if you keep quiet, you prob -- be -- you become a -- a co-conspirator. When you keep quiet you become part of -- of the system. If you keep quiet, that means in the face of the person that -- that - that mentions these names or says these names or demeans anybody else. If you keep quiet, that person walks away in the knowledge -- or in the -- with the opinion that you agree with him. They will never think that you might disagree. Oh, he has nothing to say, he agrees with me.

And I\u2019m not so sure that when I turn my back to you, where you have been speaking very nicely to me, I\u2019m not so sure that when I turn my back to you, you will not call me a kike. That goes hand in hand.\u201d And my friend Herbie, that I mentioned to you, the one -- Freedman, the one who I -- was one -- one of the first friends. When we went down to Broadway and we took a cab home at night after we had taken some girls we went out with, friends and -- and dates and taking them home we grabbed a cab on Broadway in Baltimore and asked him to take us back to Parkhats Avenue. The cabby said to my friend Herbie, who was perfect in English, of course, he went to school here, went to the military and everything. So, Herbie got the cab and he told him, \u201cGo Parkhats Avenue.\u201d So the fella says to him, \u201cOh, that\u2019s Hebetown.\u201d You know what Herbie said? \u201cPull over to the side. Pull over to the side, we want to get out of that cab.\u201d That taught me a lesson right then and there, too. That Herbie and I, we were on the same page, you know. There -- naturally America 1s -- was a society that was not in every respect to my liking. But on the other hand, I felt also that it was a place where I could -- I had no longer -- I did no longer have a fear of -- of saying I\u2019m Jewish. See, I have -- I have the -- the opportunity to come back in kind if somebody says to me, \u201cYou can\u2019t live in my area.\u201d I can say, \u201cYou don\u2019t live in my area.\u201d Or -- as bad as it is, but I have a comeback.

Let\u2019s have lunch together.\u201d And we had lunch a couple days later, which was exactly on the sixth of November. Sixth of November, 1961, I believe. \u201860 or \u201861, whatever. And it was on the day -- the anniversary of the day that I had escaped from -- from the train and we became very good friends and we formed a group, of which I was the initiator, basically, with him, called Preyudiced Anonymous, like Alcoholics Anonymous, Preyudiced Anonymous, based on the premise that when we\u2019re prejudiced, we have an illness. We don\u2019t admit to it. It\u2019s colorless, it\u2019s odorless, you know, it\u2019s tasteless, it\u2019s very insidious, but you\u2019re prejudiced.

So we called it Preyudiced Anonymous and it formed -- it turned into a group of over 100 - 150 people -- member -- members.

Did a lot of programs, got a lot of material on that that I still ha-have on hand from them -- from then. And that\u2019s how I started speaking.

The women can do their way, they -- they have -- they have time during the day perhaps, to do their meetings. We are -- because in those days women were not still involved in a two -- two family earning pattern and so women stayed home and -- more in those days. So they had time during the day to go out, instead of going in a -- go to a coffee clutch, they went to have a meeting in a -- in -- in a church or a synagogue or in a school. The men were working during the day, so we got together in the evenings, or on weekends. I never forget -- we went to Washington a snowy morning. On a weekend [indecipherable] to the Omni -- it was I think Omnibus. It was a -- in Washington there was a program called Omnibus.

And then in 1962, I got notified by the Vienna Jewish community, that the names of my mother and sisters do not appear on the list of those who have returned. In the book I call it quite a euphemism. Instead of saying they were murdered at Auschwitz, their names are not listed -- do not appear on the list of those who have returned. You know, that\u2019s a nice way of saying it. But by that time I\u2019d found out what happened to my mother and sisters and I could begin to reconcile things although the guilt stayed with me for many years until someday later, in fact maybe eight, 10 years ago, I went to a psychiatrist and consulted and had a few sessions. And he said to me, you know, \u201cIf your mother were able to come back for just a moment -- 1f she were coming back for just an hour maybe and -- and say one sentence to you, she would probably say, \u201cI\u2019m glad I urged you to leave.\u2019\u201d\u2019 Because it was she who urged me to leave Vienna in 1938.

All you have to do is just write your narrative. The escape here, the escape there. Later we\u2019ll put it together chronologically. Give me your narrative on the escapes. And on all the other things that you have experienced. And I'll work with you, edit it here, there --\u201d And in fact, in the book, he wrote a lot of the -- the historical aspects to it. I wrote about this and that in Vienna, this or that in France. And he picked up what happened, historically there, in the war or so, you know, with -- so that were cooperative effort. Edit it and helped me and when I wrote about 30 - 40 pages on this legal lined paper. You saw what it is, the -- all block lettering. He came back with a print out -- computer print out of 135 questions for me. He\u2019s a journalist. All right, this -- this is very -- real story there, with this lady on crutches in the- in -- in -- in the cattle car. But that lady had a face, that lady must have said something, must have done something. She looked like some -- what did she wear? This man that was praying there, what was the reaction of the other people? And for every -- I had 135 points to go and elaborate on, rather than write a narrative of what happened, go into details -- m-more minute details."

            "answer": "Yes, come to terms. Because I had to dig up things and realize that I\u2019m here now to tell a story and I cannot let the past be overwhelming me with these emotions when I\u2019ve got -- I\u2019ve got a family now and I got a life now and let\u2019s face it by attrition and by the passing of time. My mother wouldn\u2019t be here now anyway, which does not eliminate the fact that she was murdered, but I have to come to that -- to that realization and I have to come to that reconciliation. And I called Michael up like every other night. I say, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m now on pa -- I\u2019m now on question 18 and this is 135 quest -- and I\u2019ve had it already for about two weeks.\u201d He says, \u201cI\u2019m not rushing you. You take your time, you do -- put your -- put your -- your thoughts into it.\u201d And before you know it, I had answered all 135 questions and that was the book? No, it was not the book, this was the book, this was three or four chapters of it. And then after that my writing came much easier, because I already knew what the -- the essence of it 1s, not just that I was 1n a labor camp and worked on th-the so and so, but I was surrounded by things and I spoke to people and people had reactions. So, I could reconcile it and -- and -- and find this a very- areal catharsis. And when I was finished with it, I felt -- \u2019'd like to do more. I -- I felt a letdown. It was good to know that it was finished, but there was a letdown because I hadn\u2019t -- I -- I was actually looking forward to every new chapter, every new paragraph wh-when I was doing it. And I wrote til three, four in the morning, because I\u2019m a night person. And when I woke up during the night and a thought came to me, I went to this tab -- this table full with papers.

            "answer": "That\u2019s what I just referred to. That when I got this, I had -- there was a -- this was a milestone. So I had a -- a closure of some sort. It was the closure to know what had happened to them. Not that I had many doubts that this was it, but when you don\u2019t have the fin -- the -- the official word, you still have some hope. Because people, after so many years, as you'll read from time to time, get together and find each other. But it was a closure. And the only way it can ever be a closure is that I do not know where they\u2019re buried. That is the -- that is the -- the big thing, because most people do not realize the luxury of -- that they have in knowing the burial place of a relative. Father, mother, uncle, aunt, grandmother. Even if you never go to that gravesite, the knowledge that it\u2019s there and that you can go if you would want to, is very comforting. And it is almost a luxury for those who have that comfort, have that knowledge. Now, I do -- to me there\u2019s something like a surrogate for that. When I go to the Holocaust Museum and I see that mound of shoes there, I look at it with -- with some form of -- devotion of some sort or reminiscence or -- what do I want to call it? I look at it with some sort of a solemn feeling that perhaps, perhaps by the f -- most farfetched possibility, one of those shoes belonged to my mother or my sisters. So I use that as a reference, as a point of reference to give me some comfort and solace. And we have to do that. Just like some people go to Auschwitz and step on the ground and say perhaps the bones and the ashes of my family are here, so I\u2019m here on hallowed ground. To me those shoes mean that. Those combs and toothbrushes there, that are -- you -- you know, there -- at the museum. When I\u2019m going to that cattle car, I get shivers, you know. A cattle car, the way it is constituted there, could not have allowed me to escape, because the bars are bolted to the outside. Solidly bolted, I -- I would have never touched them. I would have never been able to bend them apart like I described doing it at my -- that point of my escape."

            "question": "Wh-When was the first time you told her about what had happened to you during the Holocaust?",
            "answer": "I did not speak too much about it in the beginning, but little by little it -- it came out, because in \u201854 we went to Europe to meet the remnant of my family, my aunt in Paris and my cousin in England. And a cousin that had survived who was an Austrian, she met us in Switzerland. I write about that. And as we came to Paris and spoke to my aunt and -- and then my other relatives that were still in Belgium since then, my uncle died, my aunt died, my cousin. Time takes it\u2019s toll. And during that trip to Europe and on the way back, I started to tell Flo more and more because she had met the family. But in general, I did not elaborate too much on -- on it, because I didn\u2019t want to dwell too much on it. Seven years ago, when I spoke to Social Security agency, in Woodlawn, a young lady came up to me and she says, \u201cLeo,\u201d she looked at me, \u201cLeo, I didn\u2019t know these things.\u201d I said, \u201cWait a minute, wait a minute, you are?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Jane.\u201d \u201cJane, my God. How time goes by,\u201d I said. It\u2019s a girl I had taken out, dating, good friend. And there she was so many years later, maybe, I don\u2019t know -- maybe some 30 -- some years later. \u201cBut you know what you just -- what I just heard you tell, you never told me about that.\u201d I said, \u201cJane, in those days I didn\u2019t talk about it. I didn\u2019t want to talk about it. I didn\u2019t feel like talking about it.\u201d But that was much -- much later than -- than when I took Flo to -- when Flo and I went to Europe in \u201854. Of course we lived together and it had to come out, correspondence and pictures and -- and the star, I had the star with me and I told her a few things here and there. And Flo was always very, very understanding in these things and very compassionate about these things. Much more than the average person I would think. And understood it and -- and -- and even today, when she reads about these things or hears about this, \u201cHow could that -- how could they do that to -- to the children? How could they do that to the old people?\u201d And she understands it. In fact, one of her first friends, girlfriends in -- in Baltimore was a girl -- a young woman who -- who had survived a -- a camp and -- and came back after the war, from Sweden. So Flo always understood a lot about these things and was very understanding and compassionate and -- had strong feelings about it."

Yeah, she did, it\u2019s a -- be good to -- you know, to -- to find out and to do the best you can with -- of -- of course when we had children later, I had to be very careful with the kids, not to inflict some of these post traumatic syndrome aspects on them, or pass it on to them, which in many families has become a problem. Many children of survivors are very actively involved. My kids are not so involved, although they know of it -- of 1t, but my son never wanted to hear anything about it and he was strongly affected by it. So we had to moderate my memories and expression of the memories with -- with the aspect of -- of the family. My -- my cousin in London -- I\u2019m not going to give anything away, but as I didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t know there is an ending to this that -- that is a very interesting ending, pertaining to my cousin in London -- never told her kids anything about her family. The kids grew up entirely sheltered from it. Now, I didn\u2019t shelter them. They -- they knew that I had meetings. They knew I had the meeting with Prejudiced Anonymous and they knew that in Prejudiced Anonymous I spoke about my experiences, because I had found my voice. And some of it was reported in the papers. A fella by the -- Lou Panos followed us from one meeting to the other and always described our meetings -- was very impressed with what we were doing. But they knew about it, because evidently I did speak about it at those meetings, because that was the essence of what I wanted to tell them. Look what prejudice did in Europe and how it can affect us all here if we do not -- if we do not speak up and talk back and stand up for what we think is -- 1s right. But Flo, yeah, en-encouraged me to -- to a -- to -- didn\u2019t discourage me to talk about it, but she was also encouraging and -- and saying you have to -- you have to make up your mind and all that -- how to deal with it and deal with it the best way you can and you can\u2019t let your life be affected by it for the rest of -- of your years, you know, so."

            "answer": "Well, when you -- when you become -- when you become an American citizen, you feel that something special has happened to you. You have become a person within a system that considers you a person. On par with everybody else. And what it meant was exactly what the judge told us. You -- most of you -- all of you -- these were Russians and Poles and Czechs and Romanians and Italians. Most of you come from countries where when you walked into a room, or a schoolroom, or an office, you had the picture of the leader of the country. We don\u2019t have this idolization of a -- of a -- of a person. The president lives in the White House and he is your tenant. Never forget the judge said. And when it\u2019s time to evict him, you doing it. He gave us the metaphor, you know. He 1s your tenant. And you come from all backgrounds, from all areas of the world and you\u2019re just a continuation of that influx that came here at the turn of the century. Unfortunately, latel-lately these attitudes have changed, forgetting that what Emma -- what what\u2019s her name said, [indecipherable] Emma Lazarus said on the Statue of Liberty, both foreign born and native born have made this country great. Go through the history of America and you see how many of -- of the -- of the pioneers, what they have done for America. So I remember what the judge said, and that always stuck with me. You come from many areas, but here nobody will malign you because you come from here, from there, because we are all alike. We are all -- we all came basically on the same boat, at different times. I did and you did and your neighbors did. The judge made a great impact on me and I felt very good about becoming an American. And I don\u2019t wear the flag on my sleeve, but when I lived in Holland, I did, because in Holland, oh, you Americans, you -- you don\u2019t know from tragedy and pain and bombing. What do you understand about the miseries of the Dutch, you know. In the meantime, they segregate the Moloccans and the Moroccans and the Turks. But they harp on the black man here. And I said, \u201cYou just come and talk to the black American and see whether he would prefer to live in your country or whether he would prefer to stay in America.\u201d And that\u2019s when I had to defend America. And they said, you do not understand what it means to be suffering. Because they had just gone through that World War Two thing and the Nazis and persecutions and hardships and hunger. Famine and all this thing. Deportations, bombings, from which I am to understand by what they say, and they say you do not understand me and you have never had that, therefore you can\u2019t understand. But we, because we had it, we have become better for it. We understand what it is and when you understand something, you apply it in your life and you become better for it. But that isn\u2019t the case. So I said, \u201cHave you become better for 1t? Look at the Moloccans. A cab driver wouldn\u2019t pick him up to take him to his apartment, because he says he is going to Battonfeld and Battonfeld is one of the suburbs where the Moloccans live, or the Moroccans. So the cab driver would say I can\u2019t take you. This is -- have you become better?\u201d And this is the arguments that I had with them, you know? That\u2019s where I stood up for America. And I was proud to do that. I said to Flo, \u201cNow, let\u2019s get back to America and relax. Now we are Americans, we know what\u2019s good about it, we know what\u2019s bad about it and we know what we want to change and we know what we can\u2019t change. And we know that it will always be the same, basically, f -- because people are people.\u201d But the times have evolutioned, you know. But in Holland, we had to stand up for America. It made me feel good. It made me feel real good when I went to the consulate in -- in 1976 and I voted. I voted in absentia."

We will not let anything happen to it.\u201d We felt that was a tribute to us by the people there, who knew who we were, who knew how we treated our customers. This is where my actions, my words -- my words and our meetings with Prejudiced Anonymous, showed some results, in fact. That it wasn\u2019t just that we spoke words, but that we acted it out in our daily lives in our business. Stores were burned down on Lombard Street and this corner liquor store at Lombard and Central, remained intact -- where others lost their businesses. Now naturally we couldn\u2019t stay there -- without insurance you can\u2019t run a liquor store. And we sold the property later to someone else and that was fine. So that was the liquor store. And that was til 1968 and I went into a -- into the book business in partnership. And my partner had the place in -- my partner had the place in Amsterdam, a book place in -- with another fella, in partnership and this fella wanted to come back to America, so I went over to manage that store for two years. Took my wife and my two daughters. My son was at Georgetown University and he finished his study. Took my two daughters over there. One went to the international school, the younger one. The older one went to an extension of Syracuse University in Amsterdam. She had just a -- about a -- had a half a year left here in high school. And did her tests with a proctor and came back in \u201876 to graduate on -- on the stage, with the kids, then we went back. And -- and when I came back -- when I came back from Amsterdam, I just went to work for my former partner -- also managing his store -- also book stores. And then in 1992, I retired from the book business. I was in the liquor store business and the book business. And at first a traveling salesman for a -- a textile company. So that -- that is basically no great -- no great shakes, but I always made a living and then -- then I wrote this book."

            "answer": "Well, the belief system is a -- is a very -- is a very -- I was raised, actually, by a quite liberal father. He -- my father was never raised -- he died when I -- when I was nine, so I wasn\u2019t really raised by him. But he was never a religious man, but he was a very activist man in social causes. And the Holocaust shaped me to the extent that there is a realization that unless you assert yourself in the face of hatred and adversity, you will -- you will become a victim eventually. Now, you have to stand up for what\u2019s right when your neighbor is being maligned, and your fellow man discriminated against. That\u2019s the way we raised our kids. Because if you don\u2019t do it at that moment, then it\u2019Il come back to haunt you because there\u2019s somebody there waiting for you -- to -- to malign you. And the- the evil of -- of prejudice and hatred, has to be recognized for what it is. That\u2019s the lesson of the Holocaust. If, from that negative experience of the Holocaust, there is only one positive thing that come out of it, it\u2019s the creation of an awareness that it can happen, so that you can fight it. Now, you have to fight it before it establishes itself as a governmental entity. Before the government has been established with that ideology. You cannot let it get to the point where it becomes officially a government policy, then it\u2019s too late already. [telephone interruption] -- we shouldn\u2019t. So fight it before it is established, because then it is too late. The Nazis have shown it to us. Other -- other dictatorial regimes have shown it to us. The -- the -- it -- it\u2019s like a web. The dictator is like a web -- in a spider in a web, I mean. The dictator\u2019s the spider. Now, this is metaphor, again. The spider gets that insect and enmeshes it in the web. But the spider isn\u2019t finished. He goes for more victims. He gets more, until this web is filled up with -- with insects, then he builds another web to catch more, you see? That -- that is -- that is what we have to learn from it, to fight when you see it. Now, can we always do it? Do our -- d-does our -- our character, our -- our temperament always allow us to immediately speak back -- or talk back, I mean? Sometime not, sometime you have to say, well, you have to watch out, maybe that person didn\u2019t mean it, you have to make allowances. But we cannot make many allowances. When there is a pattern that repeats itself. Whether it\u2019s in the school, or at work, you have to speak back. [indecipherable] can\u2019t talk. You have to talk back. And when people tell me, \u201cLeo, why did other people not run? Why did you run?\u201d I say, \u201cI was afraid, I was scared.\u201d Fear was my motivater. Then I have to give examples. It\u2019s easy to say, why does somebody not run. Well, I ran, I was free, I was single. If I had been with a family, I couldn\u2019t have done it. If I -- one elderly person, I couldn\u2019t -- a woman, a child. And in the whole history of deportations from France, there were less than a dozen attempts to escape, out of 80,000 - 85,000 people. Book shows it. But -- but when somebody says, \u201cWhy did others not run?\u201d Almost like demeaning them for not having attempted. I have one simple example to these people. You\u2019re working in an office, you\u2019re working in a factory, in a business. And you have a supervisor, you have a manager, you have a foreman, you have a boss and you come home day after day after day and you\u2019re complaining to your husband or to your wife, \u201cHe goes on my nerve.\u201d Or, \u201cShe annoys me. I can\u2019t stand it, I hate to go into -- I hate the thought of going into that office.\u201d There\u2019s nobody standing there with a gun. You can quit. All you are giving up 1s a job and you have to find another job. But nobody\u2019s standing there with a gun, threatening you and you say people should run away when they are in line, being assembled to be taken into a train, surrounded by guards with weapons? They should run away, but you can\u2019t get away from a job where there\u2019s nobody there with a weapon? It\u2019s always so easy for someone else to tell others what they should have done, when they themselves don\u2019t know what they would have done."

Had there not been a Holocaust, there probably would not have been a Jewish state. But had there been a Jewish state in the 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s, I am convinced that there would not have been a Holocaust. All you have to see is Entebbe. Absolutely. That- that is my conviction, because we lost a million and a half children. A million and a half children. As somebody wrote -- a woman wrote, Gerta Weissman Klein wrote that they\u2019re ordinary children, but a lot of them could have become very extraordinary. Luxembourg is a nation with 350,000 people or 400,000 people. There were a million and a half children who could have grown into a nation of 30 or 40,000,000, had they been allowed to live, but they didn\u2019t. Had there been a state of Israel, these children would not have died. In that respect, yes. With other things, I can disagree with Netanyahu, but he was elected. And perhaps the -- the labor government is more acceptable to a lot of people, because they were, perhaps, more -- more amenable. But Rabine also was not a man who was going to have his country commit suicide. I am sure he was not that kind of a man. In fact, Rabine was a general and Netanyahu was not. But Netanyahu is also a man who wrote an important book about terrorism, he is an expert on that. "

            "answer": "Well, had there not been a Holocaust, perhaps I would never have come to America, that is possible. But the Jewish state was already in the stages of -- of -- of planning, or infancy or a incubation with the Balfour Declaration, 1917. Of course, in 1895, Hertzel wrote The Judenstat, a Jewish state, which he became aware of through the Dreyfuss affair. And he said, if we will it will not be a -- if we will it, it will not be a dream. But, while it was in -- in it\u2019s infancy, then the -- the -- the idea, it -- it became -- it became a -- a dire necessity after the Holocaust, simply because -- because the proof was there, that nobody -- nobody was accepting the Jews. The world knew about it. The -- the ship Saint Louis came to the American coast in 1939 and Gustov Shroeder, the captain with the swastika on his lapel, called the Coast Guard, ship to shore, pleading with them, \u201cLet -- don\u2019t let me take these people back.\u201d He was crying, a Nazi. Was he a Nazi or was he a -- a -- acripto antagonist, perhaps, you know. But he wore the swastika and he was the captain of the ship, from the Hamburg - America line. And he\u2019s, \u201cDon\u2019t let me take these people back.\u201d And those who wound up in England were saved, but the ones that depo -- disembarked in Holland and in France and in Belgium, they wound up in the -- in the death camps. So the captain -- Nazi captain was right. And when you take that in history - in the context of history, you -- you -- you will see that -- that\u2019s conjecture, naturally. But the impetus was there for the state and the -- and the sympathy was there for the state and it -- and it became. And today there are problems. There are problems within that state. We know them and we hope they will overcome them."

We came back in \u00b054 and then we went to England in \u201854 to meet my cousin. I learned a lot from her, what happened to her during the war, she was in a -- in a -- lived in a building that was bombed in the blitz and she narrowly escaped. I also learned that during the blitz, when the people went into the shelters, in the underground, metro, shelters. That where they may have been at odds with each other, racially or in -- n-n -- by na -- racially or by nation or by religion or whatever. Where the -- whether West Indians in England or where some of the Asians in England were perhaps second class citizens, but when it came to going into the bomb shelters, they all slept under the same blankets. They all were together, threatened by that one common enemy. So it just shows how some situations can make human beings into real human beings, not just a species, but in action, you see? That\u2019s what we learned at -- that was during the war -- in the war. We -- we -- we went back to France in \u201854, to meet with my aunt and with relatives in Belgium and my cousin from Vienna came to join us in -- in -- in -- in Switzerland. Very little -- very little was mentioned about the tragedy of the war, it was too fresh. Much too fresh for my cousin in -- in Vienna, who had lost her father. This is described very vividly. My aunt in Paris who had lost her husband. My uncle in -- in Belgium, whose son was deported and murdered at Auschwitz. So these were things that were tacit -- tacitly part of our -- of our make up, but it wasn\u2019t much talked about. 1970 -- in 1970, we went to Israel to visit our family on the kibbutz there, my mother\u2019s youngest brother was there. It\u2019s interesting. He was there and we went to visit him with the family on the kibbutz. He is no longer alive now. And we went back to Europe and traveled by car through Europe. Again met with my aunt in Paris and my cousin in Vienna and I just mentioned my family on the kibbutz lately. We received this picture from them. This is my Aunt Sarah here, who was 90 and on her 90th birthday, this is the clan. These are her daughter and two sons, their children, grandchildren and her by that -- by that measure, great-grandchildren. What does this picture signify? That one man, Uncle Jacob, my mother\u2019s youngest brother, left Europe in 1930. One person, of one family, in 1930 and this 1s -- this 1s the result of one man\u2019s leaving Europe and not having to go through the Holocaust. This is the result. Can you extend it into -- into more people, if of our family, another five or six or 10? My father was one of nine and my mother was one of 10. If they had possibly had the foresight to go that -- at that time my Uncle Jacob was a pioneer. He was an idealist. He went to a kibbutz as a farming, you know, this was idealism. And -- and so he went there by conviction. Although, he knew what he was running away from, because Poland had had pogroms, he had lived through some of the pogroms in his hometown. "

As I describe it in the book, I felt that I was -- when I left Vienna, I felt I was leaving a cemetery. See, the hills were there, the buildings were there, the trees were there, but the heart and soul was gone and all those who could have made a difference, namely people and faces and arms clutching you -- that was not there. So you -- so you had a -- a very traumatic -- I went back in -- that was 1970.

And Flo enjoyed it very much in 1996 also, when we were invited by the Vienna government to come. [indecipherable] welcome service. This is a sort of a make up to us, you know, in a way. But it was very enjoyable, in a way, that I went back to some of the places, took some photos.

Because I -- in the face of adversity, I -- I did not give up and I think escaping from a train 1s probably a -- a great form of resistance. And there\u2019s not many that did that. Because we were going to hell, straight to hell. So that was 19 -- I said 1970 1992 -1996, we went back. And I would like to, as I said, go back again. If you want to know any more details about -- there was not much there. I -- I roamed through the streets of Vienna, went back to the synagogue, which was no longer there, where I was Bar Mitzvahed. This 1s now an apartment building and it has a plaque outside, designating it as a scene of a conflagration, destroyed by the Nazi hordes. It\u2019s an apartment building. So I\u2019m watching this and I\u2019m reading this and a lady coming out of the house, this building, she sees us and she says, \u201cCan I help you in any way? Looking for anything?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, this is the place that I went to say my prayers when I lived in this area.\u201d \u201cOh, oh.\u201d And she walked away, because she\u2019s now a tenant in that place. And then steps back for one moment and she says, \u201cI want you to know, we are living on a holy ground here.\u201d So she admitted that to herself, that this used to be a synagogue and to her, her apartment building is -- has been erected on holy ground, you know. The Austrians are 99.9 Catholics. And I knew -- probably knew just as much about Catholicism when I lived in Austria as I knew about my own religion. But that\u2019s what it was, that was the reaction there. Others were nice and -- and forthcoming. There were other people who were standoffish and didn\u2019t want to hear about it. And in 1970 -- that was \u201896, I\u2019m there talking about, but in 1970 when we were there first, I walked into a store to buy stamps and I said, \u201cHow much are stamps for America?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019re American?\u201d I says -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A ",

            "answer": "I was always traditionally very much involved with -- with Judaism, but I was never a- practicing in the Orthodox way, although I relate more to the Orthodox mood, because that\u2019s the synagogue I went to in Vienna, than to the Conservative or the -- the Reform. But I was more traditional in keeping the holidays. That\u2019s -- was my mother -- my father wasn\u2019t that way, my mother was in that way, very much devoted to the -- to the tradition, background. I have never failed in my -- in my feelings as -- as a Jew. Nothing to do with religion, it has to do with my background, my cultural inclination, my feeling about the -- the ethics of Judaism, due -- because our religion goes by the rela -- by the relation with man. Between man and man, not with man and God, because if you do good by your fellow man, you do good by God. We don\u2019t have a middle man, but I was never a very practicing Jew. We raised the kids as Jews, with some of the Sabbath meals and the candles and taking the holidays and [inaudible], my son was Bar Mitzvah. But not in the Orthodox sense. Often -- often, my wife and I talk and we say we wish we could have really been stronger involved in -- in religious venues. Although the holidays are kept. I never worked on a Jewish holiday. I made it a point not to. And I wanted to maintain that. When a -- when -- on Passover, I am very strict about not eating bread, because again, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s perhaps a symbolism, but it makes me what I am. And I\u2019m thinking of my mother, who said, \u201cYou take along your religious articles.\u201d\u2019 You know, the phylacteries and the tallith and the prayer shawl. They got damaged when I swam through the river. But she wanted me to, because -- \u201cit will remind you of who you are. Never forget who you are, because if you forget, there\u2019Il come a time when somebody will remind you of it.\u201d And if the Nazis could remind us, at the end of a gun, who we are, certainly we owe it to ourselves to know who we are without -- without the gun. And that is the -- that 1s probably what motivates me to be a Jew. I never shied away from -- from saying it or from admitting it. \u201cYou Jewish?\u201d \u201cOf course, who isn\u2019t?\u201d That\u2019s what I would say. I come back with that. We went to -- on a cruise in February, we went to Jamaica. My ca -- the fellow that drove the -- drove the jitney, that -- that little, you know, that little bus that they had for us, turns around, to me, \u201cAre you Jewish?\u201d Said, \u201cYes, Iam, but what difference does 1t make?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he says, \u201cyou are --\u201d Oh, I could have given -- I couldn\u2019t have given him a check, because I didn\u2019t have -- I\u2019m sorry. I -- I said, \u201cYou--\u201d \u201cYou Jewish?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, wh-wh-why you asking that?\u201d \u201cWell, over the ages, your people have been punished.\u201d And he gives me a lecture on Jesus. The Jamaicans are very religious, they\u2019re very Christian. Then when we got to that place where he took us, at a vantage point like a -- a vista, I took him like on the side and I said, \u201cWhy did you ask me that? Why did that make any difference?\u201d And I said to him, \u201cDo you know if Christ came back on earth today and he came to Jamaica --\u201d Oh, I ask him, \u201cTs there a synagogue in Jamaica?\u201d \u201cOh, yes, in Kingston. It\u2019s one of the oldest in the west.\u201d I said, \u201cYou see, if Christ were coming back today to Jamaica, he would look for that synagogue to go to, not to your church.\u201d I had to come back to him some -- somehow. I said, \u201cWe are all -- we are all the same. Christ was Jewish.\u201d I had to give this man a lesson. Why did he pick -- why did he pick on me? You know, people never actually -- not knowingly, take me for Jewish. They think I am Lebanese, Greek, Italian, what else -- South American. Because of my coloration maybe, my skin color. \u201cBut, what difference does it make,\u201d I told him. And, \u201cYes I am.\u201d I will never deny it. But my spirituality -- it\u2019s often this way, if you are -- if you are just a little bit inclined to be who you are, as a Jew, for instance and -- and a catastrophe comes, it can easily extinguish it. But if you have a strong feeling about it and a catastrophe comes, itll reinforce you. Because you want to prove, I have survived. It\u2019s like again the metaphor with the wind and the flame. if you have a very small flame, and a harsh -- a strong wind blows, it\u2019ll blow out the flame. If you have a big flame and a wind blows, it\u2019Il enlarge the flame, you see? But, being that I have been persecuted as a Jew, I think it\u2019s a duty to be committed as a Jew for the rest of my life. Because they wanted me to be gone and I have survived and if I am not what I am and show what I am, I\u2019m giving them a victory. That would be posthumous victory, wouldn\u2019t it? If I say, no, I want to give up my Judaism, that\u2019s all that Hitler would want. Hey, take Isaac Bashivasinger, the writer. The Yiddish language was supposed to have been obliterated. And they were supposed to brag about that later, what they did to that culture. And there he comes and writes and wins the Nobel Prize for literature, writing in the Yiddish language. If Hitler had been alive then, he would have committed suicide again. Because this language was no -- was not supposed to have survived. So that is what you call it, a vindication. A -- an assertion. You\u2019re here, you live and one of the phrases that the Jews always sing in the song and you may have heard that in Hebrew. Have you heard Im Israelhaim? The Jewish people who lives is alive. The word chaim means life. And you may be Jewish even. Are you?"

Every time the sixth of every month runs around, I have an anniversary. There\u2019s that yearly anniversary in November. But when it\u2019s the sixth of whatever month it 1s, it always jumps out. And there\u2019s another thing, I was born on the sixth of March."

That was the day I crossed into Belgium in 1938. And then I\u2019m in touch with that nun that I contacted after the -- after the -- while I was writing my book. A nun in whose care I was in the hospital in Limoge when I had a strangulation hernia, on the eighth of May, 1944, it is again the first 10 [indecipherable]. And I woke up -- I woke up in that ward and I was afrai -- I wa -- I had been afraid that I would be recognized as a Jew in that Catholic hospital in Limoge. I\u2019m circumcised. They don\u2019t do that in France. And also false papers and I\u2019m under anesthesia. And who knows what can happen while I am -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m 0 -- great fear.

Joan of Arc. 50 odd years later I wrote to the hospital, if they have a trace of her and they gave me her address where she is now. And I\u2019m corresponding with her. Just got a card from her this week. Joan of Arc."

I sent her a nice flowery card. Let\u2019s see how she puts across here. She\u2019s in castra, she is now in her 80\u2019s. I contacted her.

As a nun, she is. \u201cNothing I\u2019m lacking -- I am not lacking -- I am not wanting anything and not for want of anything and the house is very well equipped and I am surrounded by my sisters, of whom some -- some of whom were also nurses with me in the hospital in Limoge in 1944.
