We were talking about your experiences working in the crematorium folding the clothes. A. Uh-huh. Q. And what then happened with those clothes? What did you exactly do? Can you be a little more specific? Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 35 A. Well, we tried to match sizes and make bundles, attach them, and put them in a truck. The truck was going to a train, put them on the train, and then they went to Germany. Q. So these were clothes from the Hungarian -- A. Yeah. Q. -- victims. A. Uh-huh. Q. And where -- did you work in a warehouse or -- A. It was a big room. It was built specially for that. They had five crematoriums, and they build five big rooms. We weren't -- it's -- it was pretty far one from the other, but that's what happened. You know, they build the big rooms, and it was a lot of clothes coming in, pounds and pounds, of clothes from -- because people brought some with them. Bring the best thing you have, the jewelry, and this and, you know, so that's what we did. Q. Uh-huh. So you sorted out women's clothes and men's clothes and sizes? A. Right. But then after a little while, they sold the -- it was too close for the people to see what they were doing, so they put on the -- they put blankets so we shouldn't look at it. We shouldn't see. But the smell and the screaming and the yelling -- Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 36 Q. Oh, they put blankets up so you wouldn't see the crematorium? Is that what you're saying? A. Yeah. Q. Yeah. A. Because people were revolving themselves. Q. Were you standing all day doing this? A. Yeah. Q. Standing at tables? A. Yeah. They had a shift night and a day night. Q. How many hours a day did you have to work? A. Five, ten, or twelve hours. Q. Did you work during the day or at night? A. You switched. One -- two weeks you worked at night, and two weeks during the daytime. Q. And then what were your sleeping conditions like? A. Well, in the regime camp, the sleeping conditions were wonderful. We slept one person to a bed. That before we slept 12 persons to a piece of wood. Q. So you had your own bed? Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 37 A. Yes, and sheets, too. Q. What were you wearing? A. The uniform, still the uniform. Q. Did you wear the same uniform the whole time you were in camp? A. Yes. Uh -huh. Q. The same - A. Oh, sometimes when someone died, and you have the same size, and they were clean enough, you were -- or they had no lice -- because people died very quickly. Sometime when they arrived, in two, three days they were dead. So people used to ch ange around. Otherwise, you wear the same uniform. Q. For years? A. For years. Q. What would you wear under your uniform? A. Nothing. There was nothing to wear. We had lost so much weight. It was -- everything was hanging down, and you didn't need anything. And they wouldn't give it to you any way. Q. What were the sanitary facilities like when you were working in the crematorium? Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 38 A. In the crematorium, it was nice. There was -- they had showers given by men, but I didn't care. That -- i t had came to that point, I didn't care and -- Q. What do you mean given by men? A. Yeah, the showers. They would turn on the water by men. And they were - we had clean sheets on the bed, and we could change uniform if we wanted to at that time in that period of time. So for four months, it was -- well, they didn't want to we should revolve, you know. That's a way of pacifying the people. That's the way of doing -- Q. Now, did you have any contact with any of the women that you were with in the beginning once you started this new work? A. I had a tooth ache, and I asked to go into Birkenau, you know, and I saw Tony (ph) there and Matild (ph) -- no, not Matild (ph), but Danielle Casanova (ph) who was a dentist, and she was a communist, not Jewish. She pulled the tooth for me. Q. How did she pull it? Did she have any -- A. No, with a plier. I don't have much teeth in my mouth. Q. So they -- A. You couldn't wash them. You couldn't have tooth paste or no brush or no nothing. Q. Um, so they permitted you to go back -- Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 39 A. Yes. Q. -- and you had your tooth removed. A. And they brought me back. Q. What was the state of mind with the women when you went back? A. They wouldn't believe it. They wouldn't believe it. Q. What? You mean what? They wouldn't believe what you were doing or -- A. Yes. Q. -- they wouldn't believe what was happening to them? A. Yes. They wouldn't believe what's happening. Q. To them? A. Because certain Hungarian got into camp because they were liberated very early which is, um \u0152 but, so they said some, are they coming into camp, so it can't be that bad. Q. These are the Hungarians saying this? A. No. The people that were already there a while. Q. Were saying things couldn't be as bad? A. They couldn't be as bad because some Hungarians are coming into camp. Q. I see. Right. Right. Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 40 A. They're coming into Birkenau. Q. Right. So then you had to go back? A. Yeah, and then I had to go back to regime camp. Q. Uh-huh. A. At that time already Marla (ph) and her boyfriend escaped because apparently they had papers which say that they going to destroy the whole camp. They're going to bomb the whole camp so there would be no -- Q. Who is they? A. The Germans. Q. Will bomb the camp? A. Yeah. So there would be no testimony or anything. Two weeks later they find them, and they were hung, both of them. Q. Uh-huh. A. So they brought me in again. They brought in the whole camp to watch them hang, and that's what they used to do all the time. Q. Uh-huh. What did you feel like when you would see something like that? A. I couldn't watch it because I liked her very much. She helped a lot of people. Q. Uh-huh. Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 41 A. And she was a wonderful person. Q. Uh-huh. Uh -huh. A. So I keep my eyes down. I just couldn't do it. Q. Uh-huh. Uh -huh. A. And then they pull us back again to regime camp. Q. Uh-huh. And you continue to do this from April until? A. To January. Q. Of '45? A. Of '45. Q. Yeah, and then what happened? A. Then -- well, the Russian were coming in too fast, so they did not want to -- the SS did not want to be liberated by the Russian so they start to walk us. We walk for 3 nights and 3 days. I don't know, but it was a hard walk in the snow and the cold and no food or nothing. We arrived in Ludlowe, which is pretty far from Birkenau - from - not Birkenau, from regime camp. And they put us in trains, open trains, cattle trains. Q. How many people are we talking about? A. Well, I -- Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 42 Q. Is there more than the people that worked with you in the crematorium? A. Oh, yeah, because Auschwitz was evacuated. Q. So it was -- oh, you're talking about everybody -- A. Everybody. Q. -- that was marching. A. Yeah. Q. So this was not just your particular group? A. No. No. Q. So the camp was evacuated? A. Yeah, the camp was evacuated. Q. What was the talk among the people at that time among the prisoners? A. Well, we was, to an extent, we were quite scared because every camp we stopped, they didn't want us. They had their own people so we were traveling from one camp to another one. In the meantime, people were dying on the train. We had to sleep on top of them. We had to. We couldn't do anything, and -- Q. You walked for 3 days and 3 nights and then got to the train? A. Yeah. And then we asked for water. They didn't want to give us water, and we arrived in Ravensbruck, another great gem of a camp, and they accepted us. And here Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 43 we stayed, January, February, March -- no, into February. And February, I was very happy to get out of there because they were doing experimental on women, and what we saw was so horrible that we wanted to get out as fast as possible. And they did send us to a little camp, Prchin -Malkov, it was called. Q. L et's talk a little bit about the conditions at Ravensbruck. A. Oh, God. Q. If you're able to. A. It was unbelievable. People cannot believe what was in Ravensbruck. Q. What happened when you first got there? You were on the train, and it stopped there? A. Yes. And we got off, and they put us in a room, and people were laying all over, and they were dead. They were completely dead. Cold as ice. Q. These are men and women? A. No, just women. Ravensbruck was a -- Q. No. I see -- A. A woman's camp. Q. But the people on the train with you -- A. Just women. Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 44 Q. But you were just women on the train? A. Yes, because -- Q. Oh, okay. A. -- because Birkenau was only woman. The other camp was men. We were not together. Q. But when you were -- A. Men and women were separate. Q. -- working at the crematorium, that was mixed, men and women? A. Yes, it was. Q. Oh, okay. A. But they went to the men's camp. Q. When it was time to leave. Oh, I see. Okay. A. And we stayed, slept on the dead people. We eating, we didn't eat, I don't think so, but most of the time we were walking around because we couldn't take the smell. We couldn't take the idea of being with the dead people. It was horrible. Ravensbr uck was the worst thing I ever saw in my life. And then they send us a little bit outside of Ravensbruck, and there they were doing experimental on women. Q. Why did they send you there? Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 45 A. Because they had room. It was a big room there where they c an put us up. That's the only way I can -- Q. How did you know they were doing experiments there? A. We saw them. We saw the women. Q. Can you describe anything? A. Oh, God. It was no description of that. There were no hands, no feet, half a stomach out, one eye out, one eye in. It was a horror. It was horrible. It was just unbelievable. It was just -- Q. Were these people still alive? A. I don't think so. Q. So these were all dead? A. I don't know. They never came back to the country. I think they were put in a sanitarium and being taken care of there because they couldn't take care of themselves. Q. So some of these people were still alive? A. Oh, they were alive, yeah. When we saw them -- Q. Oh, they we re alive? A. They were alive, yes, but I don't think they ever went back home. Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 46 Q. I see. Were you able to talk to any of them? A. Yes. A lot of French people on the ground, (inaudible). Q. So you were there for how long at Ravensbruck? A. We were there for about -- Q. 2 months? A. Not too long, about 3 weeks. Q. Yeah. A. And then -- Q. Did people try -- A. -- and they said. Q. Did people try to help these people? A. Yes. We tried to help, and we had very little -- Q. I was going to say, what could you do? A. There was nothing much we could do. Q. Uh-huh. A. Some people couldn't eat because they cut out their tongue. So that was, you know, it was just unbelievable and cruel. Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 47 Q. Uh-huh. A. Just I -- S aint Joseph College, I don't know if you know it, in Philadelphia -- it's a Catholic college -- asked me one time to come to talk to them, and then they took me out -- we were talking about the -- it's in the clinical psychology department -- and they - I said never that I read in the history of the world this happen. And they disagreed with me. They said it was all of the holocaust. Yes, it was holocaust. I agree with them, but not organized like that. Not that were fighting wars or revolutions or even now to this day, but nothing, nothing like this. Nothing like this. And many think I don't know what happened in Auschwitz. Many think that I saw the documentary on the -- I don't know. They had families in one camp and children that were raise them to see how they were doing and then killed them. I didn't know that that was happening in Auschwitz. Q. You were 19, 20 when you were -- A. When I was liberated. Q. Well, when you were in the Ravensbruck and you saw these -- A. Yeah. Q. -- indescribable scenes. Again, how do you think you kept going? A. I was crying all the time. I was crying all the time, and I said, people -- it came to a point that I -- we were saying, nobody will believe it. There's no sense of Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 48 talking. For years I never talked because nobody will believe it. It's like a fairytale. It's worse than a fairytale. Q. So then after you left Ravensbruck -- A. We went to Prchin -Malkov, which had no worry. Q. But what was that? Was that -- A. It was a little camp, Neubulach in Germany, and it was no crematorium, no -- I'm sure it must have been -- Q. A labor camp. A. A labor camp or a prisoner camp, something like that. And we arrived in February. Again, February is the good month for me. And M ay 6 -- May 1st, 1945, we started to walk again. Q. What did you do there between -- A. Nothing. Nothing. Q. -- February and May? A. Nothing. Q. This is again -- this is the group of women? A. Starve. Q. You're still wit h women? Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 49 A. Yes. We didn't do anything. Q. They gave you enough to subsist on? A. I was so furious because they were keeping the bread for the soldiers which were passing by. They were running at -- they're running away. Q. These are German soldiers running away? A. Yeah. This is. They were running away, and I was really furious so somebody pushed me out to where the bread in, and I threw out all the bread to the people, but nobody gave me, a piece to me, but I did -- I did ve ry - my mother used to say, everybody's going to hold up, but Marie, Marie has to eat. It's not true. I could stay without eating for days. So that's -- and then we start to walk, and yeah. Q. This is May. May. A. May 1st. May 6th, I was with a friend, Maria (ph), and she said -- it was raining, and she said, the Americans are here. I said, oh, my God. She's losing her mind. What am I going to do with her? Q.

Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 50 A. Yes, there were German. They want to be liberated by the Americans. They did not -- Q. What was their treatment of you when you were walking? A. I sat down, and I said, I don't walk anymore. He said, you're almost free. Come on and walk because the American are not far from here. See, they wanted to be liberated by the Americans. They were right because the Russian were not very nice to them. And I -- she said, the Americans are here. I said, oh, my God. She's crazy, you know. I don't know if -- and I saw the Americans, but the junction, the Russian took over that part. So we were in the Russian. Q. What was your feeling when you first saw the Americans? A. I think I was numb mostly. What happened was I was walking, and in front of me, who walks in front of me told there, that bastard of the Nazi who did all the selection for the gas chamber, him, and Mengele, and Eichmann, you know. And he turns around, and he wasn't civilian. He turns around, and he said, shoo (clap). So I went over to the American, and I said, this is masters who killed millions of people. They arrested him. And then I have to be here a witness and you remember? Q. We'll talk about that. We'll talk about that. So they arrested him there, and you -- A. Yeah. Q. -- continued walking? Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 51 A. We continued walking, and the Russian took over. They put us in the prisoner - camp, military camp, with soldiers who walk prisoners. They brought -- the Americans did not know how to -- unfortunately, they were young kids, and there immediately was butter, and milk, and chocolate, and people were dying. They used to get diarrhea, and that's it. The Russian knew better. They brought us potatoes and rice, and they locked us in. They say, you don't walk out because of the Mongolian. They were raping every child, every woman, everybody they could find. So we didn't wa lk out. Q. What was your physical state at that point? Do you know how much you weighed? A. Oh, I -- I have pleurisy. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't eat. I was in bad shape, very bad shape. At that time already, I was not good at all because I came back to Paris in 19 of May, and the 20th, I was in the sanitarium. Q. Okay. So how long did you stay -- A. In the -- Q. No. In the Russian cell that you -- A. We stayed back 3 weeks, and then they wanted to take us to Odessa to the Black Sea and go back to Mauthausen. That was a little too far. We were very close to Belgium, and Holland was closer to be that way. So we asked them, and they say, fine, you know, so we went back home. Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 52 Q. On your own, you left and went? A. No. No. No. It was a train, a military train. The French -- the French who came from England with the goal, they took over a train, and, of course, they had to go -- it was so destroyed. German was so destroyed that we had to go to Holland, and from Holland to Belgium, and from Belgium to France. Q. So you got back to Paris? A. Yeah. Q. And who were you with when you got back to Paris? You were with -- A. I had nobody. Q. Okay. What did you do when you got back? A. They had a hotel, and they put us in a hotel. And I say, I'm not going to go back to another camp. To me, a hotel was another camp. I just didn't want to do that. So I went to Tony (ph), and I stay with her. She had come back early. She spoke Polish, so it was easier to come back right e arly. So -- and she find her husband and her child. So I stayed with her. Q. Did you really believe you were free at that point after all those years? A. No. So it was very hard to believe I was free. I was always looking in the back if so me -- if a German was not in the -- following me? Q. This is even after liberation? Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 53 A. Yeah. And even in concentration -- in the sanitarium, when I saw a blond with blue eyes, I said, he's going to kill me. He's a German doctor. I could use psychiat ry, but in France it didn't exist yet. Q. So you we went back to your friend Tony (ph) and -- A. Yeah. Q. And how long did you stay with her? A. I stayed not long because they -- when I went through a medical examination, they sent me to the sanitarium for 18 months immediately. Q. Where was the sanitarium? A. In Eberswalde. It's Lunzenau. It's not far from Cologne. I don't know if you know that. Q. And you stayed there for 18 months? A. 18 months. Q. Were there other survivors there with you? A. Yes, but a lot of them were Makey (ph) people fold on the ground, and then I find a letter from one of my uncles who live in America, one of a brother of my mother -- if I wanted to come here. And my friend said, well, you may never have the occasion to go to America. Try. If you don't like it, I'll send you the money to come back, but you Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 54 don't write. Send me the money. I want to come back. They were very not nice, my family. Q. I'm a little confused. You got this letter from your uncle in America -- A. Yeah. Q. -- to come. And did you go then? A. Yeah. Q. Oh. And you arrived here in the United States? How did you come? Did you leave from -- from - how did you come over here? A. I came on the quarter, and -- Q. You sailed from where? A. I sailed from Schonberg, but it was destroyed so we had to take a little boat. The Queen Elizabeth was parked right in the middle of the ocean because they couldn't dock because it was bombed. Q. So you took a boat out to the ship? A. Ship. Yeah. Q. And you took the Queen Elizabeth? A. Uh-huh. Q. And where did you dock? Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 55 A. In New York. Q. New York. And then where did you go? A. Well, to Philadelphia. Q. Your relatives were in Philadelphia? A. Uh-huh. Q. And you did this by yourself? A. Yeah. Q. And what happened when you arrived in Philadelphia? A. Oh, my uncles were not very nice. I was a kid. I didn't even know I had uncles, and they blame my mother. They blame my father. Why didn't they c ome here? Why, you know, they just -- Q. Did you know any English at this point? A. Well, some, that I learned in school, but it didn't take me long to learn. Q. And you were 20 years old now, and you're in -- A. 21. Well, 4 years later. Q. I know you are -- right. A. I was -- Q. Did you -- Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 56 A. 25 years old. Q. Oh, you came -- when did you arrive in the United States? A. 1949. Q. What day was that? A. May. Q. May of '49? A. Yeah. Q. Oh, okay. So you were 24 years old, and you went to Philadelphia. And how long did you stay there? A. With my uncle? Q. Yeah. A. Um, a year. Q. Uh-huh. A. I had met my husband in France. That's a long story. I don't know if you want to hear. It was no male, civilian male, only military male. And my friend Tony's husband saw my husband in the street, and he said, I have a girl who got an English letter, and she doesn't know the address of her uncle. Would you -- where do you come from? He said, well, I have a sister living in Philadelphia. And she looked up all the Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 57 Singers (ph), and she find them. And that's the way the correspondence started, you know, in between him, and he used to bring it to me, and that's it. When I came over here, he was living with -- he was going to school. He finished college because he was very young when he got into the army. And he didn't like to live with his mother and sister, and I didn't like to live my uncle. He was -- they were nasty people. So he said, well, I have a solution. Let's get married. So we got married. Q. Uh-huh. And you've lived in Philadelphia ever since? A. Since. Yeah, 44 years. Q. Uh-huh. (Tape cut off.) A. Yeah. I have two children. I have a boy and a girl. Q. Uh-huh. Can we talk a little bit about them? When they were growing up, did you ever share any of your experiences with them? A. That was one mistake, but I felt I didn't want to make them feel guilty. I wanted to raise them with normal, normal way, you know, not that they should feel sorry for me or pity or something like that. I'm paying it now. My daughter said to me the other day -- she told my husband, she didn't tell me -- that after 50 years, she should forget it already. I'm sick and tired of it. I'll never forget that. My son is different. He's much more sensitive, and he -- He talks about it. He reads about it. And my daughter, well, I think her husband has a lot to do with it, too. They don't want their Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 58 children to know anything. They don't want to make them feel -- the older grandson asked me, grandma, why don't you tell me the story of your number, and immediately (clap) my daughter said, some other times. Not now. He's going to be 13 years old. He should know, but that's it. That's -- we made our will, and I'm going to leave some money to the Holocaust Museum for a lot of education for the young people. Whatever we can, we're going to leave. And it's very important to me. I th ink -- it can happen again, very easily, and in America. Q. What is your feeling, having gone through what you did, what is your feeling about being Jewish? A. Well, I'm not ashamed if you want to -- when I lived in Paris, I -- we had Jewish friends a nd non -Jewish friends, and somebody told me one time, if you have Jewish friends, don't go out with them. Apparently, we didn't -- in France, they don't tell you what religion you are when they meet you or -- it's very -- it's not like in America where you immediately you ask what, how much you make, and how much this and how much. Over there it's not like that, and I was a little bit ashamed of saying I was Jewish. I should have told them at that time. I should have slapped him. Now, do it because I feel that they deserve it, but I can't hate either. I can't. I don't like the Germans, and I don't like the people who are assymetrical (ph) of racials, or I don't like them, but I don't want to destroy myself either. Hatred is very difficult. I shoul d be taking out of the dictionary, look what happened to the Germans. They hated, and they destroyed Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 59 themselves, and that's the way I felt. I never went back to Germany. I will never go back to Germany. That's one thing I promised myself. Q. Why not? A. To a certain extent, I'm scared that they are going to keep me there. A very normal reaction. And just the language, to hear the language, gives me the -- I'm scared. I get scared. It's, I think, it's a normal feeling. Q. Do you receive rep arations? A. Yes. Not much, because I didn't -- Q. How do you feel about getting them? A. To say I deserve it, yes, I guess I do, but if I would have stayed in France, I would have gotten 3 times as much. Doing it from here, it's very little. The worst part is to go to the German counsel every year, and they tell me, sign your name with one N. Like I don't know how my name is spelled, you know. Q. What do they mean by that? A. Well, two N is German. Q. Uh-huh. Is there anything else that you wanted to share? Any thoughts? Any feelings? A. No. Q. Anything that we've left out? Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 60 A. I'm sure that when I go home, I'll remember many other things. And certain things, I don't want to remember. I really don't want to, and I don't want to even talk about it. It's too hard. It's too difficult. It's -- I feel that I don't want to live if I have to live with that, constantly talk about it. It's just too hard. I've lived with my family. It's terrible. Maybe I should forget. Maybe I shouldn't remember so much, but we were very close family, and I just can't forget it. It's very difficult. Very difficult. Especially, I couldn't talk to him. My husband didn't want to hear about it. You have a different country. You have a different life. Forget it. So I learned to just keep it in myself and having a lot of ulcers. And I never talked about it. It's very difficult. The only time I used to talk is when I used to go back to Paris, and all my friends were living. And they all died already. And -- Q. These are friends from childhood? A. No, from camp. Q. Oh, you mean -- A. Yeah. From childhood, I have -- they're not Jewish, but they're very, very nice. I lived with them. They clothed me. It was very -- and when we talk about that, they knew all my family, and when we talk about it, she cries, like I do. I just -- but most of the, my family, my father's family, are, like I said, they said to me, um, a French policeman - I didn't have any money to have a winter coat, and I didn't have a winter coat when I came back, and he got me material. It was a French policeman, and a cousin of my father made a coa t. Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 61 Q. This is when you returned after the war? A. Yeah. And he asked me for money. Then his sister said, well, I can give you a coat for cheaper, but I don't have room for you. But a gentile took me in. So, you know, I don't know what t o think about it. I don't. Some good ones. Some bad ones. And you can't put everybody in the same bag. Q. Any message to your grandchildren? A. Well, I hope they grow up to be sensitive young men and to learn what went on, not to be blinded by their parents. That's what I feel. It's very important for the young kids to do that. It's very hard. Q. Before we finish, I just wanted to know what your feelings were when you received your number on your arm? A. Oh, I felt like I was cattle, you know, stamped. And I ran out -- it was February, and it was muddy, and I took the mud and tried to erase it off, but it didn't come off. And I felt very bad. I felt -- well, maybe someday if I come out alive of here out of the camp, I'll have it take n off. And then when I asked my doctor to do that, he said he wouldn't -- he didn't want to do it. He said this should be the diamonds for your grandchildren. And that's true. That's what he told me. Doctor Rosemoth (ph). So I kept it on. Many people took it off, but I kept it on. I don't care anymore. It's part of me, and it's part of what I went through, and it doesn't bother me if people make bad comments or laugh about it. It's just, I take it with a grain of salt, and that's it. I Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 62 acce pt it. I accept it. It's not easy sometimes. It's easier in the wintertime when you have long sleeves, but before -- you know, when I first came over, they made big numbers. Now, they have -- later on they put the numbers right here, but then they a re in the front, which it doesn't show so much. This shows a lot. I was the 35th thousand person in camp. From 6 million, that's early. That's very early. And this is Jewish. The gentile did not have that. Just the number. That's it. But I rubbed it very hard in the mud. It didn't come off. Oh, well. That's it. Q. Thank you very much -- A. Well, you are welcome. Q. -- for doing the interview. A. Yeah. End of File Two. Conclusion of Interview."
