            "question": "Now tell me something. This 1s, for me, somewhat odd way to start, but you wrote a novel about your -- about your experiences in Vienna and going to England. Why did you decide to write a novel and not a memoir?",
            "answer": "Because I was really less interested in the history than in being a writer. And for many years -- [ -- I have written little stories before that, and I came to the point in my 20\u2019s when it seemed to me I had no subject. I hadn\u2019t been in love, I hadn\u2019t died. None of the big events had happened to me, and I wanted to be writing. And it seemed to me that these stories that I did have with -- my experiences were a dime a dozen, everybody knew about them. And then one day I -- when 1-in -- in my early days in New York, I had gone to the new school and taken a course in creative writing, and we -- the people in that class had a s -- had a -- had a party. And somebody said to me, how did you come to the United States? And I began to tell my -- my Hitler stories. And there was that silence in the room that I have since had as a teacher, but hadn\u2019t experienced at that time. I thought, gee, wow, I have stories to tell and it a -- and -- and it came to me that these stories were my subject. But again, I wa -- didn\u2019t write them because I wanted to -- what I think 1s now known as bearing witness. I wanted to be writing. And I -- I mean another answer is that as a novelist you can in a way -- it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, it\u2019s a truism, but you can be truer that you can --"

        {
            "num": 9,
            "question": "Sure.",
            "answer": "-- how writing as a novelist changed what might be a fact. One of the -- one of the chapters in \u201cOther People\u2019s Houses\u201d was about my attraction for awhile to the stories of Christianity. No-Notice that I\u2019m -- it\u2019s the stories that attracted me. Now, in the chapter about this in \u201cOther People\u2019s Houses\u201d, I made it may -- the narrative seems to suggest that it was the people in -- my foster parents at the -- of the time, my foster -- two -- two foster mothers tried to convert me. And when they got to -- when th -- one of them at any rate, read the story, s -- read the book, she wrote me and said, but we never tried to convert you. And I wrote back and said absolutely not, you didn\u2019t. But for an -- for a story, to be seduced by a person is more -- 1s a be -- it\u2019s a better story than being seduced by an idea. In fact, it\u2019s almost impossible novelisticly to write that. So novels suit me better than history, or biography, or auto-biography. It\u2019s a long answer."

When you\u2019ve got -- you -- you go back to -- to the- to the -- to the -- to the -- I want to say real, but you go back to the -- to the event as it happened, or try to.

I was the only grandchild, the only child, the only grandchild, the only niece of two loving uncles. So I was a big deal. I will tell you the embarrassing story which explains this. My mother loved to tell the story against -- she felt 1t a story against herself, that she took me with her to a ladies\u2019 caf\u00e9 yousa, a -- a coffee klatch. And all the ladies were talking with each other and at the end, as my little coat was being put on, I was reported to have said, here one knows nothing, here one speaks of nothing. I might have been five, or six. And my mother said, what do you mean? And I said, here they don\u2019t know that I dance on my toes. Here they don\u2019t know that I -- I can do the figure eight on the ice. No, I must have been older, seven -- six or seven [indecipherable]. And my mother was embarrassed and realized that I had been made too much of, and too much admired and too much praise. But I always thought that I\u2019m incredibly lucky to have been brought up by two of the best people in the world that I know. My mother and my Uncle Paul, who -- who were both witty, loving, very, very, very much attached to me. Gave me a lot of space to show off. That was a world in which my poor very lar -- father, who was a six-footer, which was unusual for -- for a European Jew, I think, who was a -- who was an accountant, a chief accountant in the Bank of Cooksbrock and company, was an outsider. He was odd man out. He was not able to laugh, he was not able to participate in the fun that we had before he walked in the door. He was very dear and very lacking in imagination and became, when I was five -- this certainly is a datable event, and one that I remember, became very ill. He was a bleeder."

Anyhow, it was a long road, and they were -- they were riding along it and some partridges -- he saw some partridges and he took his hands off the bicycle and clapped and fell off and began to bleed. And I remember we were in my grandfather\u2019s house in the village of Fischamend, which is some half an hour by train from Vienna. Very close now, 10 minutes now from the modern V-Vienna airport, and th-that my grandfather had a house on the main square of the village, a huge house with a store, with my grandfather\u2019s straggled store at the bottom. And I remember my parents had their own room back there. My father -- remember my father flat on -- on the bed. He had -- he- J-I remember particular that he was not allowed to have a -- a pillow, and oddly enough I cannot bear to lie for two seconds without a pillow under my head. But that -- he -- there was a bucket of ice water next to his bed with little balls of butter which he was supposed to eat. I don\u2019t remem -- I have no idea what kind of a theory that was, but that was -- that\u2019s certainly one of my earliest memories of going to see my father lying flat. And it was really from that moment on that he was essentially -- well, in and out of hospital is overstating it, but I -- I do remember coming home from school and my mother saying, put -- don\u2019t take off your coat, we\u2019re going to go see Daddy, who was once again in the hospital, always with his head flat on the -- on the -- on the white sheet. My mother was always cooking diet for him. I think one of the -- one of the perhaps mistakes my mother made in her very, very lovely relation with me is to use me as a friend to c -- to -- to co -- to have headaches with and to complain of my father\u2019s illness, which stood for a lot of other weakness and incapacity, I think."
