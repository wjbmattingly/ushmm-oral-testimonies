            "answer": "Because I was really less interested in the history than in being a writer. And for many years -- I -- I have written little stories before that, and I came to the point in my 20\u2122s when it seemed to me I had no subject. I hadn\u2122 t been in love, I hadn\u2122t died. None of the big events had happened to me, and I wanted to be writing. And it seemed to me that these stories that I did have with -- my e xperiences were a dime a dozen, everybody knew about them. And then one day I -- when i-in -- in my early days in New York, I had gone to the new school and taken a course in crea tive writing, and we -- the people in that class had a s -- had a -- had a party. And somebody said to me, how did you come to the United States? And I began to tell my -- my Hitler stories. And there was that silence in the room that I have since had as a teacher, but hadn\u2122t experienced at that time. I thought, gee, wow, I have stories to tell and it a -- and -- and it came to me that these stories were my subject. But again, I wa -- didn\u2122t write them because I wanted to -- what I think is now known as bearing witness. I wanted to be writing. And I -- I mean another answer is that as a novelist you can in a way -- it\u2122s a clic h\u00e9, it\u2122s a truism, but you can be truer that you can --"

No-Notice that I\u2122m -- it\u2122s the stories that attracted me. Now, in the chapter about this in \ufb01Other People\u2122s Houses\ufb02, I made it may -- the narrative seems to suggest 3 that it was the people in -- my foster parents at the -- of the time, my foster -- two -- two foster mothers tried to convert me. And when they got to -- when th -- one of them at any rate, read the story, s -- read the book, she wrote me and said, but we never tried to convert you. And I wrote back and said absolutely not, you didn\u2122t. But for an -- for a story, to be seduced by a person is more -- is a be -- it\u2122s a better story than being seduced by an idea. In fact, it\u2122s almost impossible novelisticly to write that. So novels suit me better than history, or biography, or auto-biography. It\u2122s a long answer."

My mother loved to tell the story against -- she fe lt it a story against herself, that she took me with her to a ladies\u2122 caf\u00e9 yousa, a -- a coffee klatch. And all the ladies were talking with each other and at the end, as my little coat was being put on, I was reported to have said, here one knows nothing, here one speaks of no thing. I might have be en five, or six. And my mother said, what do you mean? And I said, here they don\u2122t know that I dance on my toes. Here they don\u2122t know that I -- I can do the figure eight on the ice. No, I must have been older, seven -- six or seven [indecipherable]. And my mother was embarrassed and realized that I had been made too much of, and too much admired and too much praise. But I always thought that I\u2122m incredibly lucky to have been brought up by two of the best people in the world that I know. My mother and my Uncle Paul, who -- who were both witty, loving, very, very, very much attached to me. Gave me a lot of space to show off. That was a world in which my poor very lar -- father, who was a six-footer, which was unusual for -- for a European Jew, I think, who was a -- who was an accountant, a chief 5 accountant in the Bank of Cooksbrock and company, was an outsider. He was odd man out. He was not able to laugh, he was not able to participate in the fun that we had before he walked in the door. He was very dear and very lacking in imagination and became, when I was five -- this certainly is a datable event, and one that I remember, became very ill. He was a bleeder."

And I remember we were in my grandfather\u2122s house in the village of Fischamend, which is some half an hour by train from Vienna. Very close now, 10 minutes now from the modern V-Vienna airport, and th-that my grandfather had a house on the main square of the village, a huge hous e with a store, with my grandfather\u2122s straggled store at the bo ttom.

I don\u2122t remem -- I have no idea what kind of a theory that was, but that was -- that\u2122s certainly one of my earliest memories of going to see my father lying flat.

So the -- the Kult-Kultusgemeinde in Vienna and the Bloomsbury House and the State Department in England cooked up this particular way of facilitating the -- the imi -- the emigration of children, but only children without parents. 193 And this is the document that got me onto the Kindertransport and from Vienna to England.

She was a -- a -- a -- a marvelously good woman. And I -- probably the -- probably a companion to the other, older woman called Miss Ellis.
