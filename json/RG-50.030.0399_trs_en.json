And they decided -- the Russians decided to go with the tanks through the streets. And that was enough.

They couldn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t let us in. Then we -- we made kilometers and kilometers during the day. We walked -- it was such a hot summer like -- like this summer, 1941 summer was very hot. And I remember my mother and -- complained that she cannot walk so long in that. And then at night we came to a place and we found a house open and empty already, no people. So we -- my father decided we have to rest there. We came in together with another family, and in the middle of the night came a peasant, a Polish peasant, or a White Russian peasant, I don\u2019t know, and said you have to run, because there are German parachutists already here. So you have to run. So the other family took the -- the bag, they -- one bag of -- of -- the light bags because the big bags were left behind. So, and they run.

If it\u2019s not true, so we will start in the morning, we have to rest. And that was too late already. When -- 1n a war, every minute counts. The other family found a -- a bus and they were safe.

Then, probably they felt already that it will be a war between Russia and Germany, so they started to take people out to Siberia, that -- the people who they thought were enemies of Soviet Union.

So they used to take the people out of their homes and to take them to the railway station and to take them to Siberia. Also peasants, Lithuanian peasants who had more than one cow, or one -- was already like a kulak in -- in Russia. A rich peasant who is exploiting others, you know, so -- and my mother was dreaming to run away from Wilna.

Come to us, please, we will -- we are rich, we are ri -- do you see, we have a house -- the house didn\u2019t belong already to us, but she told like that -- and a house, and na na na, and then come right in. We had normal furniture, fi -- nice furniture. We -- we are rich, take us, take us to Siberia. And people thought that she is crazy, what is it? I remember somebody asked me, is your mother crazy? And I, no. So why she is asking them to take you to Siberia? Because it\u2019s better than to take over the ger -- the Germans will take over us, yeah. And she was right. Mostly. Of course, not everybody survived in Siberia also, of course not. I s -- it was a very hard time, it was a very hard time to Russia at all, and it was a hard time to people in Siberia.
