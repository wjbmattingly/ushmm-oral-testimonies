He was a teacher of high school gymnasium, and then he went to stu -- to teach at the sch -- technical school, and the techni -- then he was a principal of the technical school. It was -- I think it was only one technical school in Poland which were especially for Jewish students because all the subjects were taught in -- in Yiddish.

And fer -- we had books at home, books of -- books which described the situation in Germany after Hitler come -- came to power. It was called, I remem -- I remember it, the book was la -- lying on -- on the table in our room in -- in-in my bedroom. So it was called Brunatnec Shenga in Polish. Brunatnec, it means brown, because fascists had brown, you know, shirts. And it was horrible. There -- there are pictures there about the concentration camps already in Germany. At first. political concentration camp. Communist party in Germany was very popular, and a lot of Germans were communists, so the first victims were the communists of course, you know. And my mother -- my mother knew the Germans very well. I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t think she was born in -- in -- in Germany. I th -- her mother was born in Germany, so -- and they used to go to Germany every -- every summer, probably. And my mother knew the character of the Germans, so she told my father, I remember, we have to leave Wilna. We have to out of it. Go out of Europe. I hate it. He didn\u2019t want. He didn\u2019t want. She wanted to emigrate, to the States, to Canada, to Australia, but not to stay in Europe. That\u2019s it. That was it, yeah. That why I remember it. And -- but we waited the Germans to come to -- to Wilna in 1939 already, because Polish army couldn\u2019t stand -- couldn\u2019t protect Poland, was too weak. Poles are very good soldiers actually, but they didn\u2019t have the tanks, they didn\u2019t have the equipment the -- the Germans had, so -- but the Russian came before. They occupied Wilna, they occupied all the -- the best, Belaru --White Russia, Belarusia, White Russia and Ukraine. So we found ourselves in -- occupied by Russians. What was better than by Germans, of course. It was probably two, three months m -- the Russians were in Wilna, the hosts of Wilna, ba -- but then they gave it to Lithuania. The day the Lithuanians wanted to take over Wilna was a fight between the Poles and -- the Polish -- the remnants of the Polish army and the Lithuanian army. But the fight was very, very short. And suddenly they decided that it has to be a pogrom. They have to -- to kill Jews. We don\u2019t know why. Couldn\u2019t understand why. What has it to do with -- with pola - with Poland and Lithuania? They were always tense. There were no diplomatic relationships between pola -- Poland and Lithuania before, even. So the day the Lithuanian occupied -- no, took over Wilna, so it was a pogrom. I was at home, my mother didn\u2019t allow me to go to school, but my son -- my brother was 1-in school, and she was so nervous about it. And -- and then it was the whole day, broken glasses, and so on and so on. But then I think that a delegation of Jewish people went to the Russians, who gave the city to Lithuanian. But they had a place where they just -- they were -- that their armia was standing there, together with their tanks and everything. So the Jews went there and asked them for helping us. And they decided -- the Russians decided to go with the tanks through the streets. And that was enough. They didn\u2019t do anything, they didn't kill anybody, they didn\u2019t -- the Russians I mean. They went through the streets with their tanks, and it was quiet, quiet. It\u2019s a -- quiet down everybody. Then my brother came back from school, late in the evening. He -- he told us that they barricaded the windows and the doors with [indecipherable] the tables they had in the classes. And they were waiting. Nothing special. Was no killed people, no, nothing. Only the -- the windows were broken. That is -- that what I remember, the beginning of -- of the war. And then they were almost a year -- yeah, then the Lithuanian were -- they started learning Lithuanian -- the Lithuanian language at school, and -- another language. We had a lot of languages in school. Had Yiddish, Polish, Hebrew, German and then Lithuanian, instead of --"

And he didn\u2019t want because he had a sister there. A sister who was older than he was and she was like a mother for him. The mother was sick then, he was the youngest boy -- y-youngest child in his family and she was taking care of him. So he didn\u2019t -- he didn\u2019t want to leave without her. So he used to go to her -- to her apartment, to ask her to leave with them, and she didn\u2019t want. Her husband was in the States already. He visited his brother in 1938, and the -- the war started and he couldn\u2019t come back. So he was in the States. So she was alone with one daughter, and she told [indecipherable] we are not communists, and we are not men, who will touch us? People were so naive. Oh, that\u2019s all the communist propaganda what you know, that is not true. Hitler is -- we know ge -- we know Germans. Germans were here in the first World War, and they were not so bad, we can survive with it, and so he didn't want to leave his [indecipherable] until the second day of the war. My mother packed his -- her bag. They gave me a bag, a small bag, he gave -- she gave my brother a small bag and she told my father goodbye. We are running, and you want to stay with your sister, stay. So he went with us. But it was too late. It was too late. We went to the station, we found [indecipherable] train and we went -- the train started to go, but then it were -- it was bombed. It -- it was a horrible story with the train. [indecipherable] with the train was put on hold in the middle of the f -- the forest. Stop it. End of Tape One Beginning Tape Two ",
                " So, talking about a train that it stopped in -- in the middle of the forest, and I didn\u2019t mention that the train was full, people who were running from the Germans. A lot of them were soldiers and officers from the Red army, Soviet army, with families. And the others were Jews, and [indecipherable] communists who wanted to run from the fascists. But the civilian were mostly Jews, and a small group of Lithuanian, yeah. So -- and the train was s-stopped before the old border of Soviet Union because we were still on the occupied pass of the -- the Lithuanian territory and the White Russia territory who belonged to Poland and was occupied by the Germans as I told before, after the -- the -- after the war start with Poland. And so the train stopped before the old Soviet border, and they -- the -- it was the -- the army who was -- the Soviet army that -- not that -- it was the encoverdere army. It was not KGB, but it was a part of it, like. They told everybody has to leave the train, but that the women has to leave on the right side of the train, and the military man with the families -- with their families on the left side. Then they closed all the windows and the doors from the right side where we were standing. They opened the doors for the left side, they let in the military men together with their families, and that\u2019s it. And they went. The train started to roll -- to go, and we started to cry and to ask and to shout and to -- don\u2019t leave us, and the train left. Then I looked around, the forest was full with luggage. Nobody to-took the luggage, they throw out and the people didn\u2019t know what to do, they started to walk to the border. And I remember my father coming to the border, showed his passport and told him that he was a -- a member already of a union, and that wa -- there are my documents. No, no, you are spies. Everything na -- we were -- we didn\u2019t have the passports of the Soviet Union. We were not citizens of the Soviet Union, we were the citizens of the country Lithuania, who was occupied by the Soviets, but they didn\u2019t change the passports yet, the citizenships yet. They couldn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t let us in. Then we -- we made kilometers and kilometers during the day. We walked -- it was such a hot summer like -- like this summer, 1941 summer was very hot. And I remember my mother and -- complained that she cannot walk so long in that. And then at night we came to a place and we found a house open and empty already, no people. So we -- my father decided we have to rest there. We came in together with another family, and in the middle of the night came a peasant, a Polish peasant, or a White Russian peasant, I don\u2019t know, and said you have to run, because there are German parachutists already here. So you have to run. So the other family took the -- the bag, they -- one bag of -- of -- the light bags because the big bags were left behind. So, and they run. And my father, like a mathematician, he told, look, if it\u2019s true that there are Germans all over here, so it\u2019s [indecipherable] to run. If it\u2019s not true, so we will start in the morning, we have to rest. And that was too late already. When -- 1n a war, every minute counts. The other family found a -- a bus and they were safe. And they survived the war. I met them after the war, that was -- yeah. And we were caught by the Germans. And that\u2019s it, and we decided to go back. "

And th -- and y -- every house had a -- such a -- a -- how to call it? A sign, which -- the names of all the tenants. So our name, last name, is a German name, Shreyber.

So she told no, it\u2019s not a mistake, we are Jews. So he came in, and he asked for the pas -- passports, for the documents, and he started to write name.

You don\u2019t have the names, the Jewish names, you don\u2019t have the last name Jewish -- a Jewish one. What are you thinking how -- and it was such a shock for us.

People were dying of starvation, of course, and -- and illnesses. People were taken for that, or for another so-called crime.

And we had even a school for students - everything was illegal, of course. The school was like we used to come and the teachers taught us history, and literature, and mathematics.

He asked me to repeat and I told him, I don\u2019t know. So he thought, you are not listening to me. So I told him, do you want me to -- to die a educated person? I don\u2019t care. Well, he stopped. Then the teacher of French language, yeah, I had a private less -- private lessons of French before the war. So she was a neighbor of ours in the ghetto, so my mother used to ask me, go to Eda Danielovna, go to her, she is so lonely, she already lost her husband and her daughter, she is alone, go and talk to her French. Well, I thought, what ha -- why -- what do you want from me? I can be killed without French. And I remember that only once I came to her and we talked, and now I don\u2019t know French.

So, and the lessons at school were very -- you know, it was very upsetting because every day we used to see, oh another teacher is gone, yeah. Oh, he died. Oh, this one was caught carrying a piece of bread and was taken to the prison. Oh, this -- you know, every day, so it was so -- you know, upsetting that then we closed the school at all. Let\u2019s see, they forgot to tell you about a m -- the last days of the -- the last days of the peace before the 90 -- the ra -- the war started in 1941 -- in 1941. So it was days very -- very- not quiet days, because the KGB were already -- start already to work very energetic in Lithuania. Before they were -- they kept a little bit quiet, they let us leave normally, yeah. Then, probably they felt already that it will be a war between Russia and Germany, so they started to take people out to Siberia, that -- the people who they thought were enemies of Soviet Union. Who were the enemies of the sov -- of Soviet Union? Of course, some parties, alexa -- Zionist parties, Zionist parties and BUND, and -- and rich people. So but Wilna was a poor city at all, and they didn\u2019t -- in Wilna didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t have rich people, very rich people, I mean. So, but in -- the Bolsheviks thought that everybody who has a small store was selling some newspapers and some pencils and some salt and sugar, everything in one room, is rich. So they used to take the people out of their homes and to take them to the railway station and to take them to Siberia. Also peasants, Lithuanian peasants who had more than one cow, or one -- was already like a kulak in -- in Russia. A rich peasant who is exploiting others, you know, so -- and my mother was dreaming to run away from Wilna. So she was standing on the street in front of our house, and asking them when they -- you know, they are -- the kb -- KGB was -- had the list of names and was taking one -- from one house a family, from another one. Come to us, please, we will -- we are rich, we are ri -- do you see, we have a house -- the house didn\u2019t belong already to us, but she told like that -- and a house, and na na na, and then come right in. We had normal furniture, fi -- nice furniture. We -- we are rich, take us, take us to Siberia. And people thought that she is crazy, what is it? I remember somebody asked me, is your mother crazy? And I, no. So why she is asking them to take you to Siberia? Because it\u2019s better than to take over the ger -- the Germans will take over us, yeah. And she was right. Mostly. Of course, not everybody survived in Siberia also, of course not. I s -- it was a very hard time, it was a very hard time to Russia at all, and it was a hard time to people in Siberia.

And my father told me that you cannot run away without Rachel, because my son asked me to save Rachel. Okay. So, when it was the liquidation of the ghetto, on the 23\u2122 of September, 1943, so we were -- the ghetto was surrounded already by Lithuanian police, and -- and I think even with po -- no, the -- I think mostly Ukrainian police, because the Lithuanian police, the Lithuanian SS actually knew already that the Russians are coming, and they run to the forest with another group of partisans, what they claim now that they were the patriots. Okay, maybe, but I don\u2019t know which patriot they were, but -- so they run to the forest to fight the Russians, of course, because they wanted to help the Germans, but the Germans wanted to mobilize them to go to the army and to fight the Russian [indecipherable]. They didn\u2019t want it, so they didn\u2019t obey the Germans, but they wanted to fight Russians, so they run to the forests. And of course they were afraid that if some Jews were alive, so they were going to tell that -- what -- what was going on there. So I think that the - the liquidation of the g-ghetto in Wilna was by a Ukrainian SS division, made by Ukrainians, because I remember standing with Rachel in line already, hearing them talking Russian. Russian, or Ukrainian, it\u2019s very similar, you know, you can recognize, you can understand. And we -- when we understood that we cannot go out together with the organization, underground organization, cannot leave the ghetto, we started to look for a exit, how to run.

It was like sitting like that, and it was not -- not only comfortable, but was impossible to sit long there. And -- and it was in ghetto, at -- you know, and we wanted to go out. So we walked out, the ghetto was -- looked terrible. There are no people already in the ghetto. It was dark already, with the -- the windows were open, the doors were open, the belongings were in the streets, you know. The pillows were torn apart, all the feathers. Like, I see the -- the picture like today, you know, like it was yesterday. And n-near us was a library, a big library, a [indecipherable] library. So the books were out in the streets, torn and -- you know. And we looked for people, you know, so we met three o-other girls, so we were five of us. And we decided to go to climb the stairs upstairs in a building. And I know -- I don\u2019t know how we knew that the building has a hole in the roof, and we can go out to -- onto the roof, and from the roof we can jump to another building which doesn\u2019t belong already to the ghetto. So 1t was dark, and we couldn\u2019t see well, but we saw the hole in the roof, and one of the girls climbed the ladder, and she was the first who looked out, and she was caught. So, a soldier was [indecipherable] there and watching. She was caught, and she shouted so loudly that we ran back. I remember not finding the way out of there. You know, the building, 1t was dark, where are the stairs, where are -- where is [indecipherable] run back. And then -- then we s -- we saw no way out. And we went to the building of the Judenrat, I mean like the government of the ghetto [indecipherable]. And we found this Jewish police and the government [indecipherable] and some people were there. And we -- we came to them. So the next day, we were taken together with the poli -- Jewish police and everybody. Taken to the same place where the old people were taken already [indecipherable] and old, old cemetery, what Rachel told you, called Rosa, and -- and then I wa -- I met my mother. She -- when she saw me she was surprised, and so upset, and I couldn\u2019t describe you the -- you know, I can\u2019t describe you the -- her face. She was so sure that Ill run away. She was so sure that I will survive, you know? And that was her only hope. And then they started to let out the people one by one, and to select them, one to the right, one to the left, one to the right, one to the left. And we saw that to the left, they are pushing the old people and children, and handicaps. It -- it means they are sending them to death, that we know already. To the right, only young people. And I remember that when I -- I think Rachel wer -- we walked out the first and she was sent to the right. I was the next and my mother was behind me. And he ask me -- like I was 15 years old, maybe I w-was tall, and he thought maybe I am older, but he ask me, \u201cAre you alone?\u201d I told no, no. So he -- he want to push me to the left, and I told, \u201cYes, I am alone.\u201d And he pushed me to the right. And my mother, he didn\u2019t push her, she went immediately to the left. And I stopped her, cried, \u201cMa, Ma.\u201d She -- she didn't look at me. That was the last time I saw her. She told us that she went together with -- with my father. They walked out of the ghetto together, but they separated the men from the women, so she didn\u2019t know where my father is. And Rachel\u2019s sister decided go together as a child and with the family, both sisters. They were young, they went together. And I didn't go with my mother. It was hard fo -- to me, but you know. It was a time when I ask myself why I didn\u2019t go with my mother, and then I was protecting myself and saying, oh but my mother was -- would be even more unhappy if she saw me together with her, dying. And it was only good for the Germans. More Jews are dying, it\u2019s better for them, so why I shouldn\u2019t do it? Okay, maybe I\u2019m right, maybe not, but I did it. Th-The moment I didn't think about it, I protected my life. So they gathered all the people from the left side, and they send to Majdanek immediately to the gas chambers. They were not even in the concentration camp, not one day. From the train they took them to the gas chambers immediately. And one person from the whole -- I don\u2019t know how many thousand people were there, because so many thousands were already killed, but I don\u2019t know how many. But one person was run away. And she -- she was a -- a Wi -- a Wife of a engineer who worked with my father. When I came back, she came back to Wilna after the work -- after the war, and she learned that I am in hospital right after the war. So she came to me to hospital -- to the hospital, and she told me that your mother was not killed, your mother committed suicide. So I told her I know, because my mother told me, I have the pills, they will not kill me. So she committed suicide in the car already -- in the train, on the train.

He was like guarding us, yeah. And he was crying. When I saw him crying, I don\u2019t know how I dared, I asked him, what are you crying? So he told, I am not a German. I am a Romanian. And they -- the Germans lied to me. They told me, would you wa -- would you like to go to the front? He was mobilized, yeah, he -- would you -- take into the army, I mean.

Okay, I'll be an SS. He was not ver-very young in my eyes, probably he was 35, so then I was 15, so it was old already for me, you know. So he told me -- and I have a daughter like you at home. And I looked at you and I -- and I cannot bear it. He cried. And then I -- in a short time I didn\u2019t see him at all.

I remember I woke up, I was lying -- I was leaning -- leaning a li -- leaning up a -- a -- a woman who was dead already. So, I mean, my head was on the dead corpse already, corpse. And every morning used to come several men who were taking the corpses out of us, of our room, yeah. And once I heard that the kapo who was coming and directing the people what to do, from which line to take the corpses, spoke Polish. So I ask him, look, how is this Red army? Is she coming? How far are they? Because we listen -- we heard already the bombs, the -- you know, the -- the bullets falling, you know. So he told me, what are you doing here? A language is a such powerful -- powerful thing, you know? It\u2019s such a connection between people who are not connected and maybe not even like each other. But he her -- he didn\u2019t hear Polish very much, and suddenly he heard Polish. So he ask me if [indecipherable] I mean miss. Oh, what I didn\u2019t hear wa -- for -- you know, for years. What are you doing here? I told him, you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing here? [indecipherable] do you know that you will die here? Nobody will be alive here. Go out of here. How -- how can we go out of here? So he told me, and he said, today will come a German and take some people to work with the kitchen, with potatoes, to wash it, to prepare food, I don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t be afraid, he underline me, it\u2019s not to the crematorium. Go for -- and -- and stand up -- stand there in a line and wait until they will take you. And then it was -- one German or two came, and we went with Rachel and they took us. Took us together again. Went to another house where we are having to do these potatoes, you know. Bad, frozen potatoes, preparing it for a dinner for the -- for the prisoners. And sleeping already in a room which had the wooden beds, yeah. And then we heard that they are evacuate -- ready to evacuate the whole concentration camp. Who can go, who can work? The others? They will -- they will take -- they will make a fire and everything will be burned, and that what they did. And we were evacuated. We went on that -- we went o-on the Death March, with this --"

You can see the red sky from the fire of the front, you know, and the Germans were running. And then they took us to a -- one small camp. We were -- I don\u2019t know, we were there for a week or so. And then they took us from the small camp to -- again, was a march, yeah, and then they marched in -- we -- we came to a barn, yeah. They opened the door and they told us to go. We didn\u2019t know that people are there, and we started to walk over the people. The screaming was so [indecipherable] we couldn\u2019t -- we -- we couldn\u2019t understand what\u2019s -- and the other rows are pushing us, yeah, and we cannot walk because we are walking on the bodies of other people, heads, there were legs. But that was the last place. They close the door and we didn\u2019t hear from the Germans any more. The -- they -- we were -- it was night, in the morning we wanted to go out, and we looked, you know, through the door, and we looked for a -- for a s -- piece of light where -- where -- where we can see what\u2019s going on there. And we started to knock on the door. And some women were shouting, don\u2019t knock, they will shoot us. And we knocked. We knocked, we knocked, nobody was there, so we started to push the door. And we pushed it open, no Germans. And we saw the road, and over there, the army, the -- the Soviet army is standing. So a group of young girls, and including me and Rachel, we run to the soldiers, yeah? We wanted to embrace them. They saw us, they started to run away. Because we -- then they told us that we looked so horrible, that they were afraid. What -- what are they, shadas of pe -- of some corpses, or some dead people, or -- who 1s running? And we are -- were dirty, of course. And th-then they told us that we -- they were not allowed to come over to us because we carried typhus and other illnesses. So 1t would be an epidemic, you know, they were afraid of the army. They wanted to protect them. So they run, and we run after them. And we came to a village, a German village. And I was sick, I was alr -- already absolutely sick. I felt that I -- I -- I was coughing, and I had the high fever. I felt it, I didn\u2019t have a -- a thermometer to -- to measure the fever. And we came over to a German village, we open the one house we wanted to enter. So a family was sitting around the table and telling us, raus. So we wacked out -- we walked out. We walked out and I saw a Russian officer going through, and -- and I knew Russian, so I told him, look, you liberated us, but we don\u2019t have where to stay. What -- what do you mean where you don\u2019t have where to stay? I told, they are not alone. Oh yeah? He took this, his pistol, opened the door, opened the pistol and told, if you don\u2019t go away from this house, you will be killed. So they left and we occupied the house. I lied down near a stove, which was [indecipherable] was hot. I was so cold, shivering. And Rachel was very active. She took all my clothes off, and put in the stove, yet it was bong, bong, like the lice and everything what -- and everybody did it, yes, some other girls came in. Then they took water, they boiled the water and we washed ourself. Then we took some clothes there that was in the house because we couldn\u2019t stay naked, of course, and we couldn\u2019t use the old uniforms [indecipherable]. Then came -- we were already cleaner, a little bit, it came to feeding myself. I remember Rachel brought a -- a piece of bread. Fresh bread, smelled a -- a -- she gave it to me. So I gave one bite and I told, look at, I am full already, I cannot eat any more. And she told, you know, I don\u2019t know why, but I am full also. So we stopped eating, and other people started to eat a lot. Then they were dying, you know, why it was something in the stomach and the emergency had no time, the military emergency, to take them to the hospital, they were dying. And we survived only because we couldn\u2019t eat. We twe -- we -- we didn\u2019t know, we were so young that we didn\u2019t know that you -- when you were starved al-almost to death so many -- for so many years, you can\u2019t eat a lot. You have to start from the beginning, a little bit, a little bit. Then, to make the story short, because it\u2019s so -- so very shor -- big story, we are -- stayed there for a month, and we are allowed by the Soviet government [indecipherable] the military government to -- to go home. So we went to a train, and we went to ho -- Poland. Trains were not passenger trains, trains -- also the soldiers were there, and it was a mixture, a mixture. And seems that the whole population is moving. One 1s going to Germany, the other is going from Germany, and everybody is moving. We met Polish people from Wilna who told me that my house is already bombed, that I don\u2019t have a house, and it was true. That I learned in Poland on the train. The mid- in the middle of the -- the woods, the train would stop, and the -- the train -- and -- and the people -- some people came from the woods and robbed. Everybody took the b-belongings from everybody, because what the other people did, even from Lithuania, from Poland, went together with the Soviet army to Germany, took belongings of -- the German belongings, you know, jewelry -- what -- what they left behind. And li -- and they brought it back to their country and sold it all for theirself, I don\u2019t know. There were already such people, businessmen, yeah, or businesswomen. So the others knew it, and they -- they were taking the belongings of these people. And we laughed with Rachel because we didn\u2019t have anything, so nobody took from us anything. That\u2019s it, and then we came closer to our border already, Lithuanian border, and we changed the trains, of course, and some Soviet officers told us, come girls to us, sit down there to their [indecipherable] yeah. And the train went to Lithuania, yeah. So she started to ask us from wa -- from where we are coming now, and what -- and they saw how they look. So we told them the truth, what it was and -- so one told us, look, you know that on the border of Lithuania and Poland, you will be stopped. And because you don\u2019t have papers, no identification papers, no nothing, no passports, no in -- identification papers. So we will be taken in a -- in a camp. I told, what? I am not going in any camp any more, any camp, if 1t was German, or Russians, I don\u2019t care. So he -- so I -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m going to die in Wilna. I was sure that I am dying. I was -- felt like dying, yeah. So, but I will die in Wilna where I was born. I don\u2019t want to die in Germany of course, I don\u2019t want to die in Poland. So they told, you know what? We will hide you. And there were some machines inside, what probably the Soviets were taking from the Germans already, like -- like to make x-rays. I saw the [indecipherable] like from some medicine machines or something like that, I don\u2019t know. I saw it for x-rays. And they hide us over there. And then the - the train stopped, and the people came over, also military people with lamps, lights everything looked around, asked them for papers, the officers gave them the papers. They ask, is there anybody else here? No, nobody is here. Oh, okay. So the door was closed, and the train came to Kovno to Kaunas, not to Wilna. Oh, so that we are free. Good, we are almost home. Kovno from Wilna is hundred kilometer only. So we walked out, and we were arrested immediately because we -- oh, to look at us, you can see what we -- where we came from. And they asked us for documents and we don\u2019t have it. So give us a passport, give us something, we don\u2019t have. So we started to tell them that we were taken fro -- b-by the Germans. Uh-huh, come to KGB. And then they started, we will arrest you, you\u2019re spies, you\u2019re -- everybody was spies, and you\u2019re prostitutes, you -- you run to the -- together with the -- with the ger -- German army. Look at us, I thought [indecipherable] you will look at us, saw how we look, the hair shaved, and -- but what was -- I don\u2019t know what they would do this as, if not a Jewish guy who was in Kovno already saw how the soldiers took us like that, you know, took us to the -- to the KGB. So they run there, we didn\u2019t know it, and they -- with money. So they gave her money for -- to the officer who took us, yeah, to [indecipherable] us, yeah. And he let us go."
