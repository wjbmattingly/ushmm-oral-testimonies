And then for some reason they had mercy and shot him instead of killing him with the farm implements. And this man, this neighbor described it to my mother.

My mother met a man from Germany, he had lost his wife and he was in Auschwitz and in Dachau and he lost a wife and son there. His daughter was on a Kindertransport to England, he didn\u2019t know if she was alive. He was 15 years my mother\u2019s senior, but people told my mother, who knew at the time she was probably going to go to the United States, but I -- my Zionism was, I think, embedded in me when I started going to the school there and the love of Israel and I will never forget the day that Israel was declared independent. We children -- the school was -- consisted of just maybe a hundred children. I have pictures of that, of DP camp. And yet we were so happy that those were happy times, cause we were free. And we danced all night in a bonfire and I told my mother, I am not going to the United States, I am going to tear up the papers. I\u2019m a half an orphan, I wanted to go on the Exodus. My aunt did not -- even though she had two sisters in the United States, but my cousin was seven years older than I and he swam the channel already. He refused to go to the United States. But my mother said, my only sister, she had -- there was a quota system then. My aunt got married to a Lithuanian Jew and -- who lost his entire family and they were allowed to come -- immigrate to the United States right away, they left in 1946 -- \u00b047. \u201946 - \u00b047. And we did not leave until \u201949, we had to wait for our quota system. In the meantime we had our physical exams and many of the children in the school were found to have TB. I was in a camp -- they had diagnosed it three months before they even told my mother, and then they told her that I indeed had TB and I had to go to a sanitarium, they called it a sanitarium then. And it was not in the same town, it was in Augsburg. And here I was, nine and a half, 10 years old. My mother took me there initially and she left me with all the other children. I was only able to see her once a week, it was not close. And when she came back and was looking for me, she said where is my daughter? And they said well, she is in quarantine. She has a bad case of TB and she cannot be with other children. So I was in that sanitarium for nine months. The treatment that I needed they only gave to people who had TB of the bones, not -- I had it in my lungs. And so they had to collapse a lung and th-the anti-Semitic nurses, they were not -- there were some people that were nice. The doctor that I had was wonderful, the Danish doctor who spoke to my mother. He said, I had TB as a child, I have a family now, don\u2019t worry, your daughter will be okay. But luckily we had family here, so my mother wrote to them in the United States saying that I needed streptomycin if they could possibly get it for me. In the meantime they had to perform surgery and the nurses would always tell me, you\u2019re going to go through this test, it\u2019s going to hurt. And they would give me tissues, you\u2019re going to cry. And so I believe that my tolerance for pain was established there because I showed them how brave I could be, and no matter how much it hurt, I -- I didn\u2019t give in. I -- I had to show them. I would write letters to my mother trying to calm her down because [indecipherable] said don\u2019t worry, things will be okay. I -- and I remember my mouth, I had developed a terrible tooth infection, they had to send me to -- I had an abscess and I had to go through surgery, they sent me to a different hospital where suddenly I had my period at 10 and a half.

            "answer": "There\u2019s a special bond, but it\u2019s interesting that you ask that. \u2019m very comfortable. However, when my husband and I joined the child survivor group and we went to a couple of meetings, both of us felt that some of the people were very bitter and they had a lot of psychological problems and they wore it on their sleeve, whereas my husband and I had gone through a lot, we just put it in the past. We were grateful for what we have here and try not to be bitter. I mean, what\u2019s the point? How you -- you survived, you\u2019re alive, you picked up the pieces. You have a beautiful family, you just speak up for the -- the ones that are less fortunate and you have to speak out when you see injustices done to -- you know, things that are done to other people, so that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Yes, my heart bleeds for Israel, I always worry. I know I\u2019m an American, I\u2019m a Jew, but somehow there 1 -- I have this special feeling for Israel that if God forbid anything would happen to Israel, you know, it -- what are we again? You know we\u2019re -- we're a people without a land. Yes, I -- I\u2019m a citizen of the United States, I have all my full rights here, but somehow I feel like I belong there becau -- and -- and I think that\u2019s as a result of having survived the war, not having a place to go, that\u2019s all. [sings] Tell me where shall I go. I mean, that has so much meaning to me, cause every door was closed to us. And look at how many children, the innocent children, that\u2019s what really gets to me. But I\u2019m thankful for what I have. You know, some people look at their glass half full and some people look at it half empty and I thank God for [indecipherable] yes, it could have been different, but you know, life went on, I have a beautiful family. Hitler didn\u2019t succeed. And people tell me, we thank God you\u2019re here, what do you mean you -- you say why me\u2019? It -- every shul needs a reader who [indecipherable] this one lady who is very sweet. I said thank you very much, but -- so -- and -- and I hope it -- it will never happen again and -- and any of my grandchildren [indecipherable] I wouldn\u2019t want them to go through that.

I try very hard and bond with the kids, and help out, as you do with your -- your gra -- it\u2019s a pleasure. It\u2019s just a pleasure. And I don\u2019t understand how people could do that to kids.

So he -- he saw four grandchildren and four have been born since, and he would have been so proud of all of them. Just -- I regret the fact that he never was there for a Bar Mitzvah, but I -- I feel that he was there in spirit, because I can see some of the characteristics that he had in each and every one of my grandchildren. And we talk about him a lot and his -- his memory will be for a blessing and I know he\u2019ll always be remembered.

Friends\u2019 children that 1s, who are now all grown and have children beyond the Bar Mitzvah years. So I enjoyed that very much.

I have taken, when we were allowed to, I have taken two of my grandchildren there and two of my daughters there. I -- I said -- it was such a -- an overwhelming emotional experience, I wanted them to experience it. Of course they experienced it differently than I did. But the first time I sat in the rotunda and suddenly I saw all the military walking in with the flags that liberated the camps, I -- I just started crying like a baby. It was a feeling of joy and a feeling of sadness and a feeling of saying well here I am, the greenhorn, sitting in the United States, a citizen, a -- in the rotunda and being with other survivors and seeing the flags and it brought back memories of the war and saying why me, why was I privileged? And especially this year it was very emotional because I sat very close to the stage and there was Elie Wiesel sitting next to our President Obama. And President Obama addressing us. I-I will never forget that, I was really choked up, it was quite an experience. And it -- it made me proud to be an American and seeing that they recognize the Holocaust. I mean, it\u2019s sad that we had it but at least it\u2019s there and -- and they recognize it by honoring the memory of the dead by having the Holocaust Museum, which is a-an educational tool and -- and I see so many people from different walks of life on line and that makes me feel good. Because hopefully through education, something like this will not happen again. And so I have volunteered and I will start working at the Holocaust Museum myself. It\u2019s difficult, yes. Having been through the museum, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s ha -- very hard to take when you see very graphic pictures and when you walk into a room with pictures of smiling faces and families that were, that are no longer here because the entire town was gone, maybe a fe -- a handful of people survived, that\u2019s very hard, but it\u2019s an important lesson. And I think people should go and -- and be educated and I\u2019m glad that they are offering it now as part of the curriculum in the schools.
