He told my mother you're so young and you're beautiful. Leave here, take your children and go, but my mother had a mother that she had red eyes and she was old and she wouldn't leave her mother. She had a sister one sister she was the most beautiful girl in the whole city but blonde hair. She was only 18 years old and one sister had two children and my mother wouldn't leave her sister. So, they didn't leave so she sent away her sister, the 18 year old with white blonde hair but me and my brother \u0152 my brother is in Israel now, he's younger, four years, than me and a sister two years younger \u0152 she sent us away to the Russian side, so the border we couldn't go through so at night we went through because it was already closed, the border. We had a very hard time getting through there. We came to Lomza. It was in Poland, a place where my mother left. She was wearing a green scarf and she was crying. I said, \ufb01Mommy don't cry. We're going to see each other. It's not going to take long.\ufb02 Who knew for the rest of my life I'd never see her again? We left and my aunt brought us there. She brought us to Lomza. My father wasn't there. My father was in the army and he came back home so I was praying that my mother's going to come. Then my father came alone and my aunt gave us away in an orphanage and she left to bring my mother, to bring the whole family here and she gave us to an orphanage, and I was crying every single day. Every single day, \ufb01Where's my mommy? I don't have my mommy. I want my mommy.\ufb02 I was young."

I wanted to run off from the ghetto. So we had people that were police in the ghetto \u0152 Jewish people, young guys. So I started running out of the ghetto to steal bread \u0152 because I was a tomboy \u0152 to bring some bread, not steal, bring some bread to the house. We should have something to eat. I just didn't eat by myself and I brought bread when I ran out of the ghetto. I gave to lots of people.

Ich will sie totschlagen. 4\" He would have killed me. Because for them to say a lie is the worst thing that you could do. That's before the ghetto started. I was so beaten I couldn't see.

When they're going to kill the Jews then somebody came and they said to my father that, \ufb01I think it's going to happen in the next few days.\ufb02 So, when they started talking about burning everything, like all the things we have, we should burn. Nobody should have it. Not the Belorus, not the Germans, should get nothing that we have. We started putting gasoline when we knew that the next day we're going to get killed. So we saw everybody what they were standing. I went out, I remember, very early in the morning and I saw the Germans pulling up with guns, with all kinds of things, they were holding like this, you know, everything, and they were pointing at the ghetto. My father was running out of the house and I didn't know what he said. \ufb01You wait here. Don't go anyplace. We have to be together now.\ufb02 And they started burning. It wasn't just my father, it was lots of people. I really can't remember their names, but Lopatyn 5 was one of these. His name should be forgotten really. I remember even how he looked, and then there was other people too. They burned everything. They started burning and there was smoke, and I saw there was a bridge not far from us and I saw friends of mine sitting with the feet holding like this, and they were taking them to a cemetery to shoot them. 01:18:00 5 Dov Lopatyn (1900-1944), head of Lakhva Judenrat and former Zionist leader. 6 And my father said like that \ufb01let's run.\ufb02 Before we were running, I was near water. The water was death, they called the water death like \ufb01smierc\ufb02 in Polish. And I saw the Germans. They were fighting with the Jews with knives and with ax and there as one man a Rev-Zionist6, the same party as Begin, and he was holding an ax on a German over the head in the water, and the German killed him right away and they went to a doctor. And I saw this, and I was standing with my father and my brother and my sister with their hands like this. My father said, \ufb01Don't go away. We have to be with each other. Maybe we'll run away.\ufb02 So, it was burning and here I saw something that I took so much revenge, I said to myself, \ufb01I'm going to die anyway in a few minutes. It's going to now.\ufb02 You didn't think you're going to survive, you're going to live. Who's going to live? Nobody thought they were going to live, but at least before I die I'm going to have revenge, and I saw that Rochczyn7 \u0152 a man, he was belonging to the party like Begin and he gave with the ax over the head. So, a man, a doctor was there. He was from Warsaw himself, he came like we came, in the wartime, running away from the Germans. So, they told him like that, \ufb01We're going to save all your family if you're going to save that German.\ufb02 He says, \ufb01You could kill me too because I don't give a damn anymore because I'm not going save him \u0152 he could die.\ufb02 But Rochczyn right away they shot him. He got killed in the water, but they were fighting with knives, with anything they had, they said, \ufb01We're not going to let ourselves just take to the death just like that.\ufb02 They took only the weak."

I'm going to take my brother and go and if you want to take me off of that train, you'll have to kill me first.\ufb02 So, they let me through.

They surrounded us, the Germans, and we were lying in the water very deep like in the time that was in the woods already, and we're lying.

They came off,\ufb02 she said, \ufb01make with your feet, just work w ith them, just like exercise with them, do something, because otherwise you're going to lose your feet.\ufb02 Up there they were shooting us with airplanes and around they were shouting, the Germans were running. In the middle of that the partisans came and they started fighting with the Germans. You know they were going like, how could I say it in English \u0152 even if I\u2122m so many years, since I was 18 years old in Canada \u0152 na shtyki8, they were going with big knives like this one on one. They didn't care.

When I came, I met lots of my friends, lots of people that I was in the woods together who were living in the same house. You see the house the Germans took away and then the Russian people moved in. So, they were Jewish houses, so we moved into the houses. They all lived there. Then I stared \u0152 when I was living there I thought to myself, \ufb01What am I going to do with my brother? He hasn't got a pair of shoes. He's got bare feet, with nothing on his feet. What am I going to do with him? How is he going to go to school?\ufb02 At that time four years younger than me. I was about 14 years old, so he was about ten, so \ufb01what am I going to do with him?\ufb02 I have to dress him up at least so I said to my brother, \ufb01you know what\ufb02 \u0152 in Pinsk there was a big city, there is an orphanage there and somebody gave me the address. I said, \ufb01you know we'll go together. We'll go on the train.\ufb02 He said to me, \ufb01How are you going to go on the train?\ufb02 I said \ufb01You don't worry how I'm going to go. I'm going to go, don't worry.\ufb02 So I told you when I went on the train, \ufb01you could kill me because I don't have a ticket.\ufb02 So I went and got him into the orphanage. Then my father wrote me that he's coming back from the army. Then, you know what I did? I went and I stealed him from the orphanage. I told him I'm going for a walk with him. When I took him out and we went back on the train the same thing \u0152 I didn't have any money so I went without money like that. So, I was standing at that time, when they came to control the tickets, you know, the middle [indecipherable] there is a platform. I went to the platform with him and I stood there. When the ticket control passed by I went back to the train and that's the way I came back from Lakhva from Pinsk. It didn't take long. It took maybe an hour. But there an hour . And I brought him back, and we went to my father to Lodz, to Poland. Then I met my husband there. 27"

I said, \ufb01You're crazy, don't talk like that.\ufb02 But every single day that his wife died, I started asking him to go for a walk because he was very depressed and he was talking about his wife all the time and we were going and walking a lot, and talking. Then, I fell in love with him after, and the same thing happened to him I think. So, I never believed that in that age I'm going to fall in love with somebody, because I think I love him more than my life because after that he was so sick a few times he was in the hospital. Quite a few times, and I stood by him and I always gave him faith. When he was in the hospital with a by-pass and this is the second one, because 15 years ago he had one bypass and this was the second one. He thought he was not going to live because the doctor told him that that by-pass is not going to be able to make a by-pass. I told him, \ufb01Don't believe the doctor what he says. I heard many doctors. They talk to the patient and they die before the patient dies, so don't listen. You'll see that you're going to be alive and you're going to be able to have the operation.\ufb02 A few days later he came and he says, \ufb01You know, what we're going to try to operate.\ufb02 He was so happy, just like he was going to go to dance, and I said to him like that, \ufb01Before you go to the operation, have faith, believe that you're going to live and after you're going to see we're going to buy the most beautiful things for the house. You're going to sell all the old junks you have and we're going to buy the nicest things. You're going to see you're going to have the most beautiful life. Just believe it.\ufb02 He was six weeks in the intensive care and I was sitting every single day and talking like that. \ufb01Just believe it, you'll see, you're going to have a good life.\ufb02 Just like I thought in the time of the war. I didn't think I was going to live but I still didn't want to believe it because I think I'm a survivor."
