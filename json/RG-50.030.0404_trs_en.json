He had his own business by the time he was 18. He knew an aunt who was in engl -- in London, so that he was able to have somebody to go to when he arri ved.

And my mother had a beautiful voice, and she played the piano, and my dad was a smashing looker, and many of his lady clients wa nted to go out with him, and occasionally he would be out and meet a lady and then some relative would say, Esther, I saw Philip with so and so. She would say, yes, but he came home at night. And anyhow, we -- we were very, very posey family, we used to do most things in the kitchen. One brother was a pianist, he became an artist as well, but he couldn\u2122t make a living as a pianist, but he would be sitting at the table doing finger exercises and he\u2122d say to me, Marg, what am I playing? Sometimes I would guess. My other brother would be -- would be dancing with my sister, who did ballet, and they\u2122d be prancing around and I\u2122d be rehearsing lines for a play. Mother would be cooking, Pop would come and visit and he\u2122d take something, you know, and that was it."

This is very interesting because although it\u2122s a church school and suppl emented by the London council and the church, they had Hebrew classes in the morning while th e other girls were having, you know, their Bible, or whatever, and we would have Hebrew classes. And we had a teacher and a headmaster, there were three classes. And so I learned a little bit of Hebrew, and of course had some at home, and we learned about the various holidays, and holy days."

We didn't have a di shwasher, Mum was the dishwasher. And when war came and we were ra tioned, there was no way -- she would trade her bacon coupons for cheese or eggs or something, or butter. So we kept as -- but the milk -- milk and meat was -- that just went by the board because she couldn\u2122t keep it up, it was impossible."

And my sister and I would go to the coast of Belgium [indecipherable] and all that. And you know, we always had a sense of travel. My father, I think, was a bit of a Gypsy, he loved to travel, and I think I caught -- caught the bug from him."

As I told you, I was in the British Red Cross, volunteer, and the day that the war was declared, a friend who lived up the street was also a me mber, and I -- she rang me, and she said, have you got your uniform on? And I sa id yes. She said, do you think we should report to the Middlesex Hospital? And I said, I don\u2122t kn ow, maybe. But I said le t\u2122s get together. And we did. But that was quite a dramatic moment wh en Churchill announced that we were at war, September the third, 1939, 11 o\u2122clock in the mo rning. I remember it very well. And, you know, we sort of plodded along, and until I was eventually called up for real military duty, I would go twice a week to the Middlesex Hospital emergenc y, put bandages on and stuff like that, and then I would do three nights a week after I working, and three nights a week I was on duty in the underground stations, doling out cough medicine and as pirin and stuff like that."

And I had got a job just before the war with a place on Fleet Street. My sister was working for a newspaper on Fleet Street, and I was working for a supplier of newsprint and all that sort of stu -- allied kind of thing. And when the big bombing in London started, it was impossibl e to get to work because there was glass everywhere, water, and you couldn\u2122t just go anywhere, it was -- and things were burning and that really brought the war very close to you. And at that time my mother was nervous and so she went to the country and she took my younger br other. She went to Malvern, and she found a place to live, and my younger brother, he was quite young then, and when he was about 16, he became the inspector of weights and measures fo r the area. And then of course, I was getting very agitated because I hadn\u2122t been called up, and I was -- I thought, here I am, you know, ready to go. Everybody\u2122s going off to war and I\u2122m not? And then I got my papers, where did they send me? To London. And it was to a hospital that was built for Florence Nightingale by Sir Samuel Herbert. The hospital was called The Royal Herbert Hospital, and very, very old fashioned, but it was wonderful, and I was very pleased to be there because on my off duty times I could get home to London and see Dad and my sister. And cousins would come and pop in. And if there was an air raid, we\u2122d all go down into the basement and everything would shake and then it was okay."

If you were immobile, it meant that in case of national emergency, you could be used from your home when you had time.

And we had three days on medical, three da ys on surgical and one day in the operating theater, so that, you know, we had a good background and it wasn\u2122t just bedpans, it was -- and making beds, it was really in depth work.

I would be out with a friend, we\u2122d maybe gone for a walk somewhere up the hill, and he would say, wait a minute, there\u2122s one coming, duck. And we\u2122d lie down on the ground and we\u2122d count, and then you could tell, from the moment that the engi ne stopped, whereabouts it might fall. They were the closest calls.

And that was an experience, because we had to meet at a certain station. We\u2122d alrea dy been given a clothing allowance, and we had equipped ourselves, we had to get battle dress and a beret. And we had our outdoor uniforms and our indoor uniforms. And we had an allowan ce for laundry, three and sixpence a week. And you know, you had to wear a clean apron every day, and they were the aprons with the big red cross on your bosom, and these caps that you floated around with a red cross on the back, and you had these big starched tails. Anyway, we -- we went on this tr -- we had no idea where we were going, it was all very hush-hush. We arrived, and we found out it was Liverpool, and from there we boarded a ship, and the ship I went on was called the Sumeria. And everybody named it the Spameria, cause that\u2122s all the kind of meat we had. And we were in convoy, there were 12 ships. And a convoy moves at the rate, at the pace of th e slowest ship. And of course, going through the 8 Mediterranean, we had various frights when they were doing these land mi -- mines, you know, minesweeping. And the noise was deafening, absolu tely. And then, after about 10 days out at sea, we were told that if we got up at five o\u2122clock the next morning, we would see an island where a British singer was very famous. And we knew that was the Isle of Capri, and Gracie Fields, one of the singers of England. And so we knew we were heading for Italy, but we thought we were going on to India. However, our consignment stopped in Naples, and we were housed in a nursing sister\u2122s quarters in Vomero, which is just north of Naples. We had a nice time there, we weren\u2122t working yet. And there were lots of American troops there, and they were wonderful. They took us to their PX\u2122s or -- or UF -- USO\u2122s, and we had our first piece of meat, and we had our first orange and our first banana. Things -- and ice cream, which we hadn\u2122t had for three or four years. And then they would take us off to dances, which was lovely, and then we went -- after a week there we went by hospital train across Italy to -- where di d we land? Somewhere on the other side, and eventually we were stationed in Barletta, which is just south of Bari, big port, and we were with the American fifth army a nd the British eighth army. They had huge medical facilities and we had prisoners of war there, everything."

And we eventually arrived in Mestre, which is the other side of the Venice causeway, so that in the evenings af ter work if we were off, we could go into Venice. We\u2122d cadge a ride on the trucks, and there was nothing to buy in the stores, but it was just wonderful. I knew every little bridge, and every little church. It was great.

You soon found friends, and your assigned to your quarters, and we were in a little house just outside the hospital which had formerly been married quarters. And there were four girls in this house. We became very friendly, and the n, you know, you\u2122re -- you\u2122re a little bit nervous because here\u2122s a great ward with about 20 men in bed, coughing and spitting and -- you know, and oh come here nurse, hold my hand. And then they would want to give you their rations, which you couldn\u2122t really take because some of them would -- oh, and then we had the TB ward, so that was a little bit scary. And then -- oh, eventually I did six months in the operating theater there, which was really wonderful. Didn\u2122t perform of course, but you know, for some of the operations you could hold the retractors and some of the casualties were very bad because near -- there\u2122s a famous arsenal at Woolidge, and those civilians were entitled to the military treatment. 10 So when that place was bombed once, there wa s a middle aged man who had a terrible stomach wound, and I was assigned to help dress it. And it was -- you know, you felt you were doing something. Oh, I remember my first experience, I\u2122d only been there a week and a young boy, and he happened to be Jewish. He was about 21, young soldier and he was having great difficulty breathing. And the doctor came up to me and he said, nurse, can you do artificial respiration? And I said yes. So he said, well take over from nurse. Nurse was, you know, leaning acro -- on the bed, and doing this, and I took over from her. And then they said, keep doing it, and if you can, don\u2122t give it up, bec -- and while you were doing it, you know, the boy was breathing, we\u2122re taking him downstairs to the ir on lung. And we took him downstai rs to the iron lung, and here\u2122s me still pumping away.

            "answer": "Well, because I ran into Amy Zoll. Amy Zoll at that time, she wasn\u2122t Gottlieb. And we had known each other and she said to me, \ufb01Oh,\ufb02 she said, \ufb01what about coming to Greece, we need somebody there.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I can\u2122t go to Greece.\ufb02 She said, \ufb01Well anyway, come up to the headquarters of the Joint,\ufb02 which are here in London, and she said, \ufb01you\u2122ll meet the lady who is in charge.\ufb02 When we got there, this Dr. Schwartz was there. She introduced him and she said, \ufb01Dr. Schwartz, this is Marguerite Glicksman and she\u2122s coming to Greece with me next week.\ufb02 And that\u2122s how it all happened, and I thought, well, that sounds interesting. And then I thought to myself, Greece, it\u2122s a different language, it\u2122s a different alphabet, how am I going to get on there? Not one word of Greek. So I bought a Greek book and I started to learn the alphabet. But the learned the upper case, capital letters. The -- the others just flayed me, I couldn\u2122t cope with those. But when I got to Greece, I was -- I was sent to a hotel, the Grande Bretagne, and shared a room with a British girl who worked for the embassy. And it was temporary because then you could look around and try and find your own place. Well, I was with this girl, and then I was invited to Amy\u2122s, and anoth -- the deputy director , I don\u2122t know if you\u2122ve heard of her, she\u2122s no 15 longer with us, Belle Mazuer. She\u2122s quite a character, and she -- she had been an archaeologist in Greece before the war. That\u2122s another story. However, Belle and Amy invited me to come to their house for dinner. And I said, well how will I find it? They said, tell the taxi driver so and so [indecipherable] whatever. And course I could see signs, I couldn\u2122t read them, I didn\u2122t know. So I thought, I\u2122ve got to learn the alphabet, at least I can read what\u2122s on the shops and what\u2122s on the stores and what the streets are, which I did, and I was able to cope. And then I was working for the director as his secretary, but Belle Mazuer asked me if I would do a study of students, and that was a wonderful experience. These young me n, some had been hidden in the mountains while the Germans were invading, some were retu rnees, and they had mostly been towards the end of their studies, ready -- almo st ready to take their degrees. But they had nothing. Some of them had no families left, some of them had a bit of family. But they were poor because everything they had had been taken away by the Greeks. And so what I had to do was interview each of these students, find out what they needed; books, a place to stay, food, etcetera. And there were about 22 of them I think I interviewed, and I am still a friend of one or two of them. Eventu -- and the students took me under their wi ng and I would go to the university dances with them occasionally, and we were -- we became good friends. One of the boys, he, I\u2122m sorry to say died, he became the head of the -- the Greek railway system, engineering. The other one, who is still around, he became a biochemist, did very well for himself. Some of the others I lost track of."

Stacks of clothing were sent by the American 16 Joint to Greece and we had people who would sort it, women\u2122s, men\u2122s, children\u2122s, sizing and all that, and they could go to this depot and get clothes. And one of the -- one of the young men who was working in that, he was what we call pre-TB. They were borderline TB cases, and we had a little sanit -- sanitorium for these people and they were looked after. Well this young man, he was cured, and he married one of the girls at the girl\u2122s home, that was the first wedding they had there. They were able to emigrate to the States and they went to Baltimor e. Very, very wonderful thing, when I was in the States and I came to visit them, Niko said to me, Marguerite, he said, I would never have had this in Greece. They had a nice little apartment. He said, look, a refrigerator. And he said look, my bankbook, I\u2122ve got some savings. It was absolutely beautiful. Anyhow, unfortunately -- oh he -- he did very well in Baltimore, and he, one day in his -- he had a store for working men\u2122s clothes, and one day he was shot in the store. However, he was -- he survived. They had two daughters, and he was no more, but his wife Renna continued, and why - we used to go and see her, but we\u2122ve lost touch because she got sick and we couldn\u2122t communicate and we\u2122ve lost touch, which is very sad.

Well, I was very friendly with several of the young men, one or two who worked in the office, and this young doctor I told you about. And they would come back to my place because my apartment was on a direct line to a big hospital in Athens called the Evangelismos Hospital, so I had water every day, all the time. Everywhere else they would have an hour in the morning water, and maybe two hour s in the afternoon. So the boys would come to my place, and they\u2122d all take a shower.

            "question": "-- that\u2122s a long time.",
            "answer": "Yes. Well, I\u2122ll tell you. One of the girls in th e girl\u2122s home -- and I saw her when I was back in Greece last year, she was a very pretty girl and sh e had been engaged -- she\u2122d been on the island of Crete and she had been engaged to a non-Jewish man who had been very much into politics and he was anti this, that and the other. And I think he was killed. But she was in Athens and she was one of the girls at the girl\u2122s home. She\u2122d lost all her family and everything. Her name was Eka. Well, Eka -- oh, I have to interrupt. At the girl\u2122s home -- before the war, Greek girls and particularly girls of good families never work ed, all they did was learn how to do housework, cook, embroidery and that was it until they got ma rried. So that these girls came back and they didn\u2122t work, they had no professions. So this was a part of what was done for them by Joint, through the National Council of Jewish Women, and what\u2122s the other organiza -- ORT, yes. And ORT sent sewing machines, and so the girl s at the home were l earning to sew and do dressmaking and stuff like that. Well, Eka learned to sew very well. And they decided that she had a flair and that she should go to the home that they had in Paris and learn haute couture. So, 23 in order to get Eka to Paris was about six months work. And I would go to her the -- to the police because somebody who knew her ex-fianc\u00e9 had told about her, that she must have been a radical. And so the -- the passport people wouldn\u2122t give her a passport, they wouldn\u2122t give her any permission to leave. And I would have to go to -- she had to have a representative from the Joint to go with her to all these interviews and police th ings, and so I used to go with her. And finally she did get the visa and she did go to Paris and she did learn haute couture. And when she came back, she started a little business on her own, which was a wonderful thing. And I\u2122m trying to think what else they did. Course many of the girls at the home were adopted by people in Canada and in the States, and so they were able to emigra te and lots of them came over. And this one girl I told you about, she\u2122s a cousin of Matsas, Nina. Nina had a sister, they were both in the girl\u2122s home. The sister was younger than Nina and sh e was adopted by a family in Canada. And so Esther came to Canada where she married and had a wonderful family, four lovely children, and Nina eventually came to Canada, but she didn't li ke it so she went to New York, where some of her other former girl\u2122s home girls had gone. A nd so they had a little sort of clubby kind of relationship. Nina eventually married and her husband knew people in Washington and they said, why are you staying up there? Why don\u2122t you come down here and we\u2122ll set you up in a restaurant? He knew catering because he\u2122d been catering ships. So Nina and this husband came down to Washington, and I don\u2122t know if you ever went there, but there was a restaurant in Bethesda called The Diplomat. It was on Wiscons in Avenue, it was wonderful. And then they finally retired, and they sold the business. Her husband died at the beginning of this year, and anyhow, I spoke to Nina and I said, Nina, would you be willing to be interviewed if they think that you would have a good story? Sh e said of course. So anyhow --"

And that life goes on, a nd it\u2122s no good dwelling on the past, it\u2122s not going to help. No, I think there\u2122s a very nice attitude, and I -- I really was -- I mean, it was surprising because I know a lot of people who\u2122ve suffered, maybe illnesses and stuff like that, and they go on and on and on, and it\u2122s -- it\u2122s bad, it doesn\u2122t help them and it doesn\u2122t help anybody else. Know, when I -- oh, and how the -- the people went to Spain. After the war, Charles and Fofoe went to Argentina. And I don\u2122t know how they managed it, but Charles found that he had two brothers who were living in Spain. And you know, in -- in years before the war, Jews weren\u2122t in Spain, they\u2122d been expelled in 14 - something and there were no real Jewish communities. Well, he heard that his brothers were there and they said, why are you in Argentina? Come to Spain, come to us, we\u2122ll set you up in a business and you\u2122ll be alright. So they managed to get to Spain and they\u2122re in this luv -- they\u2122re outside Barcelona, but I think they have an apartment in Barcelona, but they have litt le stores that sell novelties and souvenirs at a resort called Lloret de Mar, where I have been and visited them. And it\u2122s just wonderful, and as I say, after all the experience that poor Fofoe went through, she managed to have a son. Lovely boy, and they have -- he married, and they have a little boy who is named Kavlos. And they 26 travel a lot when the season is over and they can shut shop, they go off. And this young couple, with their little baby, since he was one, they\u2122ve traveled all over the Pacific and Far East. And I get cards from them. [coughs] Excuse me."

Now, Lydia Escanazi, who is -- she was Lydia Sabitie, she came -- she was hidden, she and her sister Audette, who was married to Danny, they were hidden in the war. The parents went into the mountains and she was hidden in a basement of some people, some Greek people. And they were there for si x months and they never saw daylight. And she used to say, when we came -- when there was pe ace, and we came out of this basement, this cellar, she said, we just -- we ran. She said, we just ran and ra n and ran, we didn\u2122t know where we were running, but we were absolutely ecstatic. And anyhow, her parents eventually came back. Well, they had been quite a wealthy famil y. Her father had been with the Austro-Hellenic tobacco company. And so, when the girls were young, they had a fr\u00e4ulein, so they spoke beautiful German. They went to the Lyc\u00e9e Fran cais, and they knew French. They also knew English, I don\u2122t know how that happened, but they spoke beautiful English and Greek, of course. Anyway, they -- the family had a house in Athe ns, it\u2122s 18 Corniavo Street, but the Greeks had taken it over and they could not get it back. But finally, with the help of Joint, they were able to get one room, and that one room was set up as an office, the regional office for the Joint. And then, years and years of work and hard labor, they managed to get the whole house. And fortunately, they had enough money to pull it dow n and have it built into nice apartments. And Lydia and her husband live in that building in one of the apartmen ts, they rent the others. Lydia had a grandmother called Madame Faragi. I neve r met her, I think she was gone by the time we got to Greece. She was very wealthy and she had a house in Salonika. It was on the water, and 27 after the war, the royal family used it as thei r summer palace, and the family couldn\u2122t get the house back. But they eventually -- either they got compensation for it, which helped a lot -- they didn\u2122t get the house, but they got compensation, which was better than nothing. And of course, Salonika was where the main Jewish community was before the war, and those Germans had desecrated the beautiful cemetery there which was on a hill overlooking the sea. And those tombstones are used as paving ston es. Very, very sad. And -- oh yes, when we were in Salonika a -- during our play, there was one young girl, Anna Morthul, whom I\u2122d met, and we went with her -- we found her and we went and had a meal with Anna and her future husband. Anna, I think, had also been in camp. I\u2122m not sure, I can\u2122t re member that. And who el se can I think about?"

And I had a couple of dresses made that way, and you went to this -- the fabric place and you chose your material and you either drew a design you wanted, or you looked in some books and they did the best they could.

So we made a lot of American friends and many of them said, why don\u2122t you come over, you know, we\u2122ll give you a good time, etcetera. Well, my sister and I decided that it would be lovely to go to the States. We c ould visit relatives that we\u2122d discovered there and also we could do a tour. And if we got emigratio n papers, we wouldn\u2122t have to hurry and if we ran out of cash we could get a job. So we decided to do that. And in those days it was easy to get a visa. Even -- my sister and I were able to ge t a visa without having a sponsor, because we had enough money to take -- although you weren't allowe d to bring much money out of England. So I went ahead and joined my friend who was living in -- she had just moved to the States, living in Manhattan, and I joined her and waited for my sister to come for this big tour. She was asked to go and help with the reparations -- things in The Hague, so she was delayed for six months -- no, three months. And by the time she got there, I had run out of cash and had to get a job. I also wan -- didn\u2122t want to stay at my friend\u2122s house any longer, it was not right. So I had found an English girl and we collaborated and we shared an apartment, but I had signed the lease and it was two year lease and I couldn\u2122t get out of it. So when my sister arrived she took off and had a holiday in Mexico and when she came back we -- you know, it was too late to start our trip, so we got jobs. And then in 1956, we decided we would go back to England and see if we could stay there, or if we didn't like it we could come back to the States. We got to England, we had a very good year doing practically nothing but visiting and enjoying ourselves. And then in 1957 we were asked to go to Vienna because of the Hungarian uprising and they needed people in Vienna to help. So, both Leba and I went to Vienna. I stayed for a year, but after three months Leba was asked if she would go back to London because there was trouble in Egypt and they needed somebody in London to help with th e Egyptian immigration.
