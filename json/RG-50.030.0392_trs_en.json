And up to 14, there were only girls. We were not allowed to play with boys, or anything, no.

I went out with -- with Peppy and with his friend and didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t mean to me and I went out with him. This was in the afternoon.

And once I had a date with one and a third one came, with a letter -- I should choose between the two. This letter happened to be there. This -- this was Werner Felner, it was a third one from the group. And -- and then I choose, not Peppy, I choose Wolfgang. And -- but I was not seriously interested to go out with him. And I went then on holiday to San Kilton and didn\u2019t write any more. This is -- 1t was -- it -- 1t -- it was ver -- it was nothing serious. And there, so it dropped up and a year later, or something, I -- I am got -- once I got -- I had to go to -- I wanted to go to the national library, I was writing an essay for school. And Peppy offered me to -- to show me the ropes in the library. It\u2019s a national library, where I hadn\u2019t been before.

I went to the ministry and met this colleague. He received me with hand cuss -- hand kiss and -- and he said to me to make an application and the law was changed.

When you have -- when you have the book, it is in my book from -- from that time on, nine hours are enough -- for -- to -- at that time -- this was already in the Schushnik time and I went -- sent to the unt -- netiskotes over the university.

And -- and I get it -- got it back through the university and then I said, \u201cNow, you see, I can -- it\u2019s all right.\u201d And [indecipherable] said to me that God can do everything, he said to me. And he mentioned for my sake was a -- a law changed at the university. In my -- in one of these papers, in my papers, there it is written in it, that nine hours are enough from now on, to -- for a term.

So he- after the Nuremberger laws, he was regarded as a Jew, not as a half-Jew. Even his mother was still a Jew.

And of course we -- when we talked -- when he talked at home, I mentioned immigration, then his mother said she\u2019s jumping out of the window, she commit suicide.

It was a mental illness, 1t was something -- he died in a mental asylum. And he was in for long time. They went once a week, the mother and the son, to visit him in that -- it must have been as he was a teenager, it must pas -- have been a harrowing time. Yoyosee.

I thought this was such a -- a parcel with pants or what -- what -- for the -- for the men. And I went out by the window and went on the -- in the field and put the -- the parcel down, because I could speak to the French in French and tell them to go and collect it.

And she wanted me -- she was an Austrian and she of course expected that every Austrian is a perfect cook and she wanted me to cook for her school in Southampton.

The kinerl and all this what I\u2019d -- I -- I so -- I started se -- very exactly the cookery book, every day and it was successful. I was there for quite a time, I don\u2019t know any more how long. Angela was taken into the school and was exactly treated, we -- like any other girl, there was no difference. They were very -- she -- I bought the uniform for her and she was bathed and washed by the matron. And the matron put her to bed, as a -- I must say, I -- there were no difference at all to any other girl in the school, she was -- when she was there. And in the end, I went back to -- to London. I was very lonely, of course and her - her -- s-son of them, who was at that time a young man, he came from Eden and he was -- he was living there. Now he is an MP in -- in the House of Parliament and the kitchen maid what they had, was a Hungarian Baroness at that time, because they were the Russians and she came to London and was a 19 year old girl. She was working there and she was [indecipherable] a Hungarian Baron -- aristocrat. And so -- in any case, then I went back to London with Angela and I went -- I could give -- I -- I -- I was working -- living in the house. This was the daughter of the British am-ambassador in Norway. But they were very -- they had a house in Kensington. I had one s-sh -- I had only working permission for a housemaid. I couldn\u2019t do anything else. And she engaged me as housemaid, but she didn\u2019t pay me. They were -- they hadn\u2019t any money, 0 actually.

The state was only half a year old, you did need an invitation. So I sent a telegram to Mimi, she should send me the invitation, but she didn\u2019t answer. She didn\u2019t want -- she was always jealous of me and she didn\u2019t want me in Israel. And she didn\u2019t send me the invitation so I could go. Later on, years later, I was very lonely. M-My life in Israel would have been easier, because I wouldn\u2019t -- I would have joined a kibbutz and I would not have been so lonely, with no English and bound with -- in the job, with a child. You couldn\u2019t go out anywhere. I would not -- and later on, once Angela was at school and was on holiday, I thought I go to Israel in a fortnight whe -- when she is in England in -- on holiday in the summer. And I wrote my sister that I want to come. And her answer was not, \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to see you.\u201d Her answer was, \u201cDon\u2019t give up your job.\u201d And so she was afraid now, I don\u2019t know what Hansie has written -- that I would come and be in -- something -- so I didn\u2019t go. This was the end of my visit, I didn\u2019t go. I didn\u2019t see her. And -- and so I -- I was staying in -- in London and was working at -- Angela was -- it was a difficulty where to live. She was in different school, in four different school and in England at that time, I don\u2019t know if you know, they made the 11 plus. This was with 11 -- at the age of 11, every child had to make an exam. If they get -- if they are ready for grammar school. And she was in four different schools and she -- and in the end she 2 was in the Solomon Wolfser school and there were 28 pupils and only four passed the exam. And she was one of the four. When she rang me up in my business, she passed, I couldn\u2019t believe it. I rang up at first somebody else if it\u2019s true that she passed. And then I left everything and -- and so she could go to grammar school. She want -- won a -- a scholarship for a grammar school and she was taken by -- by the Burlington School. This is a very old school with a good name and it was -- this is where she told -- she had an interview where she told she sees her father every two years. And the headmistress -- in when I had the interview, she ask me what -- what it means. So I told her I\u2019m divorced, she didn\u2019t know that I\u2019m divorced, no. She didn\u2019t -- when I told her -- she was eleven [indecipherable] I must tell that I\u2019m divorced. When I told her, she said, \u201cIt can\u2019t be. You love each other.\u201d But she didn\u2019t know. She was brought up like in a complete family, I didn\u2019t want her to know. But then she -- and then she was [indecipherable] was in Burlington school and -- until I got married and then I may -- I moved -- she moved to a different school, to Copedale in Edgeware."
