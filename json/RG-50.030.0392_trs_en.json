You had to -- you had to be lake, it was called belake -- as a -- to choose what you want to hear. And I had only one lecture, a nine -- nine hour lecture a week, only. And 11 ho -- 11 hours was a minimum, but it was three y ears as a only silliness that I didn\u2122t have 16 more, that I had took only s -- nine lectures.

And I didn\u2122t say to anybody -- not to my mother, not to anybody, a nd one colleague, I told it, one [indecipherable]. He said to me -- he came a few days ago to me and said if I want to -- if I want, a colleague, another colleague wants to meet me, he was the son of the first attorney in -- in Austria and his secre -- his friend was secretary of the Minist er of Education. This was \u201a37 already, in the -- in the Schushnik time. I said, \ufb01Y es, I want to meet him.\ufb02 And he made me -- and itta -- as a -- an appointmen t with the secretary of the Minister of Education. This was, at that time, Baron Parasini. I went to the ministry and met this colleague. He received me with hand cuss -- hand kiss and -- and he said to me to make an application and the law was changed. For my sake, the law was changed, from -- it is in my book. When you have -- when you have the book, it is in my book from -- from that time on, nine hours are enough -- for -- to -- at that time -- this was already in the Schushnik time and I went -- sent to the uni -- netiskotes over the university. I made the -- the application th rough the university, through the Minister of Education, I have met him. And -- and I get it - got it back through the university and then I said, \ufb01Now, you see, I can -- it\u2122s all right.\ufb02 And [indecipherable] said to me that God can do everything, he said to me. And he mentioned for my sake was a -- a law changed at the university. In my -- in one of these papers, in my papers, there it is written in it, that nine hours are enough from now on, to -- for a term.

So he -- after the Nuremberger laws, he was regarded as a Jew, not as a half-Jew. Even his mother was still a Jew.

They went once a week, the mother and the son, to visit him in that -- it must have been as he was a teenager, it must pas -- have been a harrowing time. Yoyosee.

And she wanted me -- she was an Austrian and she of course expected that every Austrian is a perfect cook and she wanted me to cook for her school in Southampton.

The kinerl and all this what I\u2122d -- I -- I so -- I started se -- very exactly the cookery book, every day and it was su ccessful. I was there for quite a time, I don\u2122t know any more how long. Angela was taken into the school and was exactly treated, we -- like any other girl, there was no difference. They were very -- she -- I bought the uniform for her and she was bathed and washed by the matron. And the matron put her to bed, as a -- I must say, I -- there were no difference at all to any other girl in the school, she was -- when she was there. And in the end, I went back to -- to London.

Now he is an MP in -- in the House of Parliament and the kitchen maid what they had, was a Hungarian Baroness at that time, because they were the Russians and she came to London and was a 19 year old girl. She was working there and she was [indecipherable] a Hungarian Baron -- aristocrat. And so -- in any case, then I went back to London with Angela and I went -- I could give -- I -- I -- I was working -- living in the house. This was the daughter of the British am-ambassador in Norway. But th ey were very -- they had a house in Kensington. I had one s-sh -- I had only working permission for a housemaid.

The state was only half a year old, you did need an invitation. So I sent a telegram to Mimi, she shou ld send me the invitation, but she didn\u2122t answer. She didn\u2122t want -- she was always jealous of me a nd she didn\u2122t want me in Israel. And she didn\u2122t send me the invitation so I could go. Later on, years la ter, I was very lonely. M-My life in Israel would have been easier, because I wouldn\u2122t -- I would have joined a kibbutz and I would not have been so lonely, with no English and bound with -- in the job, with a child. You couldn\u2122t go out anywhere. I would not -- and later on, once Angela was at school and was on holiday, I thought I go to Israel in a fortnight whe -- when she is in England in -- on holiday in the summer. And I wrote my sister that I want to come. And her answer was not, \ufb01I\u2122m looking forward to see you.\ufb02 Her answer was, \ufb01Don\u2122t give up your job.\ufb02 And so she was afraid now, I don\u2122t know what Hansie has written -- that I would come and be in -- something -- so I didn\u2122t go. This was the end of my visit, I didn\u2122t go. I didn\u2122t see her. And -- and so I -- I was staying in -- in London and was working at -- Angela was -- it was a difficulty where to live. She was in different school, in four different school and in Engla nd at that time, I don\u2122t know if you know, they made the 11 plus. This was with 11 -- at the age of 11, every child had to make an exam. If they get -- if they are ready for grammar school. And she was in four different schools and she -- and in the end she 132 was in the Solomon Wolfser school and there we re 28 pupils and only four passed the exam. And she was one of the four. When she rang me up in my business, she passed, I couldn\u2122t believe it. I rang up at first somebody else if it\u2122 s true that she passed. And then I left everything and -- and so she could go to grammar school. She want -- won a -- a scholarship for a grammar school and she was taken by -- by the Burlington School. This is a very old school with a good name and it was -- this is where she told -- she had an interv iew where she told she sees her father every two years. And the headmistress -- in when I had the interview, she ask me what -- what it means. So I told her I\u2122m divorced, she didn\u2122t know that I\u2122m divorced, no. She didn\u2122t -- when I told her -- she was eleven [indecipherable] I must tell that I\u2122 m divorced. When I told her, she said, \ufb01It can\u2122t be. You love each other.\ufb02 But she didn\u2122t know. She was brought up like in a complete family, I didn\u2122t want her to know. But then she -- and then she was [indecipherable] was in Burlington school and -- until I got married and then I may -- I moved -- she moved to a different school, to Copedale in Edgeware."
