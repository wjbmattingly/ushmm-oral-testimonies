But at the end of our studies, we didn\u2019t have the same opportunities like the Romanian graduates. The Romanian graduates had open fields, we could take only second-hand positions. This was still much better than for other professions. From the probably early thirties, no Jew could get a job as a teacher in public schools, only in private schools. And no Jew was ever admitted to be a civil service employee. Same thing in the Army. 1936, when I was in the Army, in just an eight months course for engineers, the, none of the Jews were, was admitted to the exam to become officer in the Reserve of the Romania Army. So. And we had to serve a few months longer. In my, in 1937, at the end of 1937, when I was employed 1n a private engineering firm, the the government, the embassy made(ph) the government came to power, Kovan Kuza(ph) and our company gave us every months by the end of the month a note that this is our last month of work and say on January 1, \u201938 I got a note that, that my employment will end January 31\u201c, \u00b038.

Lotte, with her family, stayed diagonally across on the same street so we met there quite often and though as I said, in the beginning, we had problems with food, but because in the Bukovina, like in all of Romania, food was plenty and then we got to barter different things from house.

I read to her, it said, \u201cThere will be punished with death everybody who will house Jews, who will give shelter to people not, not entitled to and those who will help flee people away.\u201d So I said to her, \u201cI don\u2019t understand. This has no relation to us. We don\u2019t want to flee and we don\u2019t want to give shelter,\u201d and I read to her.

On, on October 14, we were told that these three, few streets including ours should pack and go to the railway station. So we put all our belongings on a peasant cart. The peasants came to make some money and we waited on the street to go to the railway station to the trains, bringing us Transnistria. In the meantime, while staying there, the people started talking that some number will stay, will not go. And said, one lady said, \u201cYou know, engineers should stay.\u201d So a Romanian major passed by and I said, \u201cMr. Major, I , Should I stay or go?\u201d He said, \u201cStay.\u201d So I took with Lotte this cart which had all the belongings of the 11 of us and we took it out of the streets leading to the railway station into a part of the ghetto we were supposed to leave the next days. We had to bribe a soldier because he was supposed, we were not supposed to go, go there and there we stayed on the floor, all of us, one night only. Next, that evening, Parryom Poppovitch(ph) came to the Jewish Hospital which was the seat of the Jewish community or say the council, Jewish council, we could the community and said, \u201cI have with you, I have for you good news,\u201d he said. Because he talked to them in Germany, news was called paseera(ph) he said, \u201cPaseera(ph) which is good news. You will stay.\u201d And the day after, they opened a few more streets for the ghetto and we got into a very good house belonging to uncle of Lotte\u2019s where we stayed for the next, \u2018til the end of the ghetto.
