I'll tell you later. \u00b069, or maybe seven \u2014 well, when a \u2014 and I tried to get involved with that, I begged my husband to get involved with that. And we sang \u2014 we went to the \u2014 President Reagan spoke then \u2014 no, so it must have been much later, was in the 80s. Okay, early 80s. And President Reagan spoke in front of the Holocaust reunion group. And I signed up for a few seminars at the convention center in D.C. And I attended the second generation seminar. I don\u2019t know what made me do that, but they spoke on children surviving, and families surviving. And I finally realized \u2014 the reason I wanted to get involved in this thing was because I just felt 1t. But what I realized at that time, and realized that I am a survivor, was that families of my \u2014 of my generation, did not survive. I realized I was very unique and very rare, because children my age did not survive. And \u2014 and my siblings as well, my sister and brother, who were sent out to God knows where. And how they reunited with their parents, and how my father survived all that. We were very unique, and I cherish that in my \u2014 in my head, I \u2014 I could not believe that as a family unit we survived, you know? So that\u2019s when I realized I\u2019m a Holocaust survivor. We were in no camp. We were in no labor camp, but I think we survived many \u2014"

And it \u2014 I think he did a lot of damage to our children because he wasn\u2019t open with them. But they always pursue, they always ask questions. But I find that a very, very difficult part of my life, yeah. My brother-in-law, he was liberated in Auschwitz, and for many, many, many years he would not speak of it. Like, I think it was a normal thing of many survivors at that time. But a few years ago, all of a sudden, everything came out. Everything came out. And he had a tremendous 1-interview with Spielberg and the \u2014 I believe the Holocaust Museum as well, an extended one. He made several donations to the museum. I think one of his shirts is hanging there. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s different than the others. I\u2019m sure you have enough of them there.
