My father had a particularly uh hard task, because not only did he have to find a place where they would be safe--my mother bein g particularly vulnerable as a foreign Jew. And, of course, the French were focusing uh much of their coll aborative efforts in terms of turning over Jews on the foreign Jews. So my mother was particularly vulnerable. Uh, but in addition she had a problem pregnancy; and apparently the only chance she had of bringing the baby safely into the world was if she had as much peace and quiet and food as possible, which is a bit of a tall order for Nazi-occupied Europe. Uh, and this friend uh suggested Le Chambon. He...he knew the place; and my father went there and found a room to rent, and uh went back to uh get my mother. And they came on a little steam engine train that uh brought many Jews there, as we know . And uh...uh it was uh singularly fortunate, because I'll uh...I'll also men tion that uh the doctor who took care of my mother in Le Chambon was exactly for me the right doctor in the right place. Not only did he happen to be a whiz of a doctor who had trained under Al bert Schweitzer in Africa, dealing with all sorts of problems and apparently had a repu tation as a bit of a me dical genius, but in addition he was a a committed Christian--one of the first uh of the ar ea to be committed to non-violent resis...resistance against the Nazi s--and had a special st ake in my mother's situation and this baby that she wanted to bring into th e world. I don't think that uh she would have gotten better medical attention if I had been born in the most modern American facility today. 3"

Uh, I was discouraged from...from rememb ering. I was discouraged from asking questions. And I think that's tampered with my ability to remember. And maybe that's what's given me a...a compelling need to...to document precisely, because I don't trust memory. Or maybe even to tell stories such as I do. Uh, so I remember uh startling little. In fact, the most startling thing I...I've thought about sometimes is that uh--particularly I have a two and a half year old daughter now--and...and is that I realize I was four when I came to America, and I cannot until then... Obviously, I did not speak English. And I cannot remember ever...I cannot remember the experience of having been in a foreign land and not speaking the language. I have absolutely no recollection of it. And that , to me--and...and I ca n't imagine that that wasn't a traumatic experience, and I cannot connect with it. I cannot remember it.

Uh, the uh...I...I now believe that part of the reason I wa s raised so French was that it was a way of obliterating the Jewish. Uh, I went to a French school. We spoke French at home ; although I shouldn't 7 overstate that, because there was also my...my mother. Even though she was originally from Poland had a great love of Fran ce. By the way, she spoke French uh impeccably; and that had something to do with her survival during th e war, too. She was ab le successfully to impersonate a Frenchwoman. I ha ve uh come from a family with great linguistic skills. Uh, my sister later became an actress in Mexico, uh playing Mexicans on the screen, you know. And as anyone who knows about acting knows, there's nothing mo re difficult than that. So it's...it's like, it's funny how you see these things follow through.

In fact, interestingly, uh although I wasn't uh...I didn't know I was Jewi sh, we...I always knew we were different. We were foreign. It's almost a way in which my parents prepared me to...to then absorb the truth. If they had been people who complete ly assimilated, I certainly would have been a different person. They never did. Uh, just by remaining French, by remaining different, by not even being immigrants...my parents, I...the y never really identifi ed them[selves] as immigrants. I always had the feeling in the b ack of my mind that one day we would go back to France. My father was a correspondent. You know, that this was not necessarily, you know, the...the final mo ve.

Uh, it was a gr eat...except for a few members who joined in th is conspiracy of not, of keeping the secret fr om the children. Uh, but uh it's still stunning to me to realize that my mother had aunts and uncles in...in New York whom I never knew, because they couldn't be counted on to maintain the secret of our 9 being Jewish.

Although he did see it uh before he died, and the whole process that I was involved in was a very difficult one for him and a very scary one for him. Uh, after all, he had built his whole public persona on not being Jewish. And uh...and as a journalist this was, you know, sort of a co mpounded irony. Not only was he a journalist, he was a good journalist; and he was also a crusader for truth and had been all his life. Uh, with this one big lie in his life. And here he had bred, as these things sometimes happen; this increasingly public Jew - not only a Jew, but somebody who was even insistent on being quite public about it. And uh I'll never forget one day uh in the early '80's, uh and I had this French film director who was vis iting in L[os] A[ng eles] and we had dinner or whatever. And I talked about myself, and just coincidentally he went to New York shortly thereafter and he met my father. And uh in a ph one conversation the following Sunday, my father said, \"Why did you say that I...\"--that my father--\"was Jewish?\" I thought, \"What...what was he talking about?\" And I said, \"I...I didn't talk about...I don't even remember talking about you.\" And then he said, \"Well, I met this director. And he mentioned...\" And then I realized I had ta lked about myself; but talking about myself exposed my father. And I'll never forget that conversation. This wa s my...my dilemma, and it was in fact my di lemma in making the film - to preserve their privac y, their right to have some control over how they led their lives, which I basically believe was my obligation.

In fact, my closest friend for a numbe r of years was. Uh, at least uh related [to the Holocaust] in the sense that some of them, th eir parents had come like in the '30's. And often those people don't identify as survivors, because they came earlier, even though they still lost a lot of their relatives.

Whether it will be a 16 very pronounced one, or whether I will decide enough of this and this really doesn't matter to me that much. I...I really don't...I really don't know. I know that uh I felt a need to have an identity, that the only identity that it made se nse for me to have was the identity of my ancestors. Uh, and that I have indeed become increasingly comfortable wi th it, that I realize that a lot of who I am is indeed uh wrapped up in...in Judaism and uh its influences on my family. You know, the influence. ..the influences exist whether they're identi fied or not. The fact that my parents uh never acknowledged being Jewish doesn' t mean they weren't, in very fundamental ways, very Jewish. Uh, and uh and that influence was prob ably there. Uh, but uh... (Pause) You know, it's interesting how th ese things work. I think the people of Le Chambon made me more Je wish. They... First of all, I came to believe that at bottom, when you've cut through all the specifics of why they did what they did or all the conjecture--one can do all the factors that come into this-uh at bottom everything flowed from their own inescapable sense of their own identity. Th eir own sense of comfor t at being who they were, at having no questions about who they were. And everything flowed, almost inescapably, incredibly naturally and very spontan eously, from that. That sense of identity. And if one derived strength from that, that root edness, uh well then I had to try to aspire-particularly as a parent, and wanting to be able to raise strong children--had to aspire to a similar rootedness and had to find my roots. And my roots were in being a Jew, so that was the only way to go. In addition, when I was making \"Weapons of the Sp irit,\" I realized that the way in which the film would be most effective would be if it was a Jewish film in praise of a group of Christians. It couldn't be a...a neutered film...w ouldn't go anywhe re. And that forced me to ...to absorb and un derstand as much as I could, to.. .to really be as Jewish as I could be in the making of that film. But that it 's...it had to mirror, in a way, the...the reunion that took place in Le Chambon between Jews and Christians, that it had to emb...em body it. As best as I could, as ignorant as I am still about so much of Judaism, it had to be uh Jewish. 17 And I'm very touched, by the way, when uh or thodox Jews are responsive to the film, as indeed the few who have spok en to me have been.

But really what...when it's talking about ...and you talk to Jews who were in the area, they are talking about the area . They are talking about \"Le Plateau\" 1.

And, in fact, it's a symbol for the area. And in Le Chambon it self, there is very much that concern. Le Chambon itself doesn't want it to appear that it is trumpeting itself in any way, particularly Le Chambon versus Le Mazet or versus Fay. You know, there were pastors in all those areas who were actively involved in what went on. Uh , and for posterity it is certainly, it is crucially important that that point be made.

It...it's so typically Chambonais, in a way. Because, of course, it would be a shame if...if anyb ody wasn't born. But it was both very, very personal and very, very broad.

            "answer": "Well, I'd like to say something about right eous Christians, such as the people of Le Chambon, to which I am increas ingly devoting part of my life . And perhaps particularly this: as we come to attach more importance to them, and we are doing that, we must not fall into a trap. The old trap used to be to dismiss them, to ignore them, to consider that all this was so uh...they were so few in number that they're not impo rtant. Because th ey were few in number. And, of course, they were few in number. But that 's precisely what makes them important. Uh, and that somehow focusing on them will whitewash that period, that somehow it will make...give the world an excuse to feel better about itself. Well, that's not the way it works. On the contrary, they make us accountable. They prove that it was possible to care. And that is what is necess ary. If we hand on only a memory of...of...of bitterness and hopelessness, then the world is off the hook. If the world ends up thinking that it is not possible to combat evil, that it is not possible to stand up, then...then it's off the hook. Then it's not possible to do anything. So that that...all those things we will quickly come to understand. But the...the...the trap is that we not, in focusing on them, start idealizing them. That we not put them on pedest als. That we not make heros of them. Of course, they appear to us unusual because they weren't many and there's something inescapably moving about them. But it is crucial that we take their word for it, that what they did came naturally to them. It was normal. It was no big deal. That these people are no different from us. That what they did is...w e are capable of doing. Uh, that uh they acted out of emotions and attit udes that were not heroic, larger than life uh ...you know, emotions; 27 but just very small normal emotions. Uh, there were...there were hero-types also during the Holocaust. There were people like Raoul Wa llenberg or Andre Trocm\u00e9. These were people who had a...a compelling need to make their mark, to...to... These were heros. Most rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust were not that sort. They were very ordinary people, who simply responded appropriately to the challenge that they faced. And they are the most relevant to us. Very few of us are going to be Raoul Wallenbergs. All of us, every day, are faced with choices that involve re cognizing that there is a need to help, uh a need not to turn away, a need to realize that we are responsible for something that is going on around us. That we can influence positively . And we need to know--in a way, in the most selfish...for the most selfish reasons--that responding to that need will make us feel good, will make us feel uh peaceful, happy, uh will prolong our lives. Uh to care about other people is fundamentally to care about yourself. And that is part of what I hope uh people will derive from contact with...through museums, throu gh books, through films, will derive from learning about the righteous gentiles of the Ho locaust. And the righteous Jews of the Holocaust. Because they existed, too."

I think that uh maybe people who 28 are raised with stories all their lives sometimes take them fo r granted. Uh, people who trust their memory often have maybe less of a ne ed to document. Because I have such a precarious memory, because it's such a challenge for me to...to...to remember things, I only feel secure if it's in some way recorded. To me, it only exists when it's recorded. And uh I think that may have been a big part of this compulsive need to document uh the story of Le Chambon and--forgive me for saying so, but-to really document it as accurately as I possibly could. You cannot footnote a film, but I love history. Uh, I love academic research. I...I really wanted th is to be as uh accurate as it po ssibly could be; bearing in mind that any film has to have a dramatic flow , even a documentary. So, you know, you...you tell; but at the same time--and that was part of the reason that it took so long and was such a challenge, in terms of putting it together--to both respect the hist ory, respect all the details, have every detail right, and yet not have it be boring. Which was my primary obligation as a filmmaker. It had to...the film had to work . I think that uh my traumatized upbringing probably had a lot to do with my need to tell the story, and probably had a lot to do...certainly had a lot to do with the effect that the people of Le Chambon had on me. Uh, you know, the amazing thin g to me, as I've come to reflect on this a little bit, about the influence of the story of Le Cham bon on my life is that it rea lly uh...it happened twice. It happened at my birth; but it happened when I was an adult and I came back there and met these people again, and was so heavily influenced by them that it really changed my life. And I really feel that they rescued me tw ice. And perhaps it is that second form of rescue-the rescue of me as a lost, rootless, depressed adult--that gives \"Weapons of the Spirit\" something of a universal message. Because I do believe that many of us, even though my case may have been exteme, that many of us do have a need for positive stories to hold on to. Legitimate, real realistic sources of hope. And that I had that ne ed. And... and the film- 29 the making of the film a nd the film itself--responded to that need. And maybe that it's how to give the story whatever univ ersal ramifications it may have."
