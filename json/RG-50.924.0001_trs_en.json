There was a sense that it really\u2014 people didn\u2019t want to hear too much about it. So it could have been, oh, at least maybe something like 20 years before it was acceptable or desired. And I think that had mostly to do with a new generation displaying an interest in it. So it would have been\u2014 And the first time actually I talked to, would have been either in this unaffiliated group that we belong to, that I might have spoken to them, and\u2014or our daughters, one of them in high school perhaps. Susan\u2019s high school class was interested. So that would have been around 1970 or thereabouts. That would have been the earliest time."

That was a big deal (you know) for the whole-\u2014 to appear before her own class. So it was more in terms of what it meant to the audience than for my own need or desire to-to relate this particular period of my experience."

It\u2019s changed most recently, I think, when I started to change my attitude as to what it is I was trying to accomplish by talking about it. But all along, I preferred to minimize the frequency of my talking. I kind of had a feeling that if you keep repeating the same thing, it changes the actual story; that basically the-the experience first becomes a story, and then the story becomes the experience. And I didn\u2019t particularly like that."

So as time goes on, what-what I was reading about and hearing about other people and the books and things that was published, somehow some pieces of that become interwoven in my own talking about my experience. And so I was kind of concerned that it\u2019s really the connection between the actual past and the past as I saw and read about it, was being not-not in good\u2014 not a good connection.

Now, sometimes, whenever I could, like in a recent talk where I quoted from other documents that were describing what was going on at the particular period, that was clear. I was not talk\u2014saying it was my experience, but it was my background. But I was concerned, and I still am (you know) concerned, that probably too many details that I might now relate as being my own experiences are really experiences | relived or rejuvenated from what I have heard and read."

And that is that I- I get\u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say bored, but not that interested in repeating the same thing again and again if I do it too often. So these two things together, and perhaps other things, deterred me from accepting or certainly not offering to have many-many talks about it. (Yeah.)"

            "answer": "Well, it\u2019s in the\u2014 1n-in the purpose. First of all, because of the way I\u2019ve (you know) I-I operated, I work, I need something new, to bring in something new, in whatever I\u2019m doing, whenever I can. It\u2019s been my (you know) professional experience to do that. I have something like 13 patents to my name, and all the time looking for basically innovation to solve a problem. So to just do this without looking for something new was not very interesting for me. So it\u2019s when I find a way to combine this need for something new, something useful hopefully, that I started to- to accept, especially from the museum in most recent years, to-to accept the opportunity. And certainly other work that I was doing in the museum, it\u2019s because I was\u2014 I was\u2014 I could use my mind, basically. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape | SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 4"

            "question": "When you have told your story over the years, you lose your own past?",
            "answer": "In a sense. It\u2019s interesting that I\u2014 if I have spoken to our-our group that we belong to (and that\u2019s now some years ago), I did that because it fitted into the series that they were having, education kind of series, like the creation of the state of Israel and what was my own experience, was to highlight the time. That-that helped. But it was that particular need, and also in what I did in the archives in my first assignments, was-was not that routine. When it becomes routine, I lose interest."

            "question": "Did you have a personal need, after having survived, to tell others about 1t?",
            "answer": "Not-not much. No, not much. Of course when-when the people you deal with and you relate to, you don\u2019t like to have a hidden history. So when opportunities came in more intimate relationships, friendships with other people, that I didn\u2019t mind relating some of these things, provided I could\u2014 I could sense an interest. But that was the main reason. And of course there is\u2014 When there is an interest, you kind of\u2014 you tend to make yourself important by showing up this kind of thing. And I\u2019m sure this played some role. But no-no driving interest to actually go and spread the word, like people keep telling me (you know) I should write a book, with such an interesting background, such adventures. I-I don\u2019t get interested in doing that at all, simply because I can see that so much of it is being done. So what\u2019s one more story? It\u2019s doesn\u2019t (you know) add that much to it. So unless I can find another purpose, I don\u2019t dwell on this story. In general, I don\u2019t dwell on the past\u2014not just my experience during the war years, but even more recent experiences in other areas. I tend not to dwell on the past; try to focus, look for some purpose, some- something of interest in my present environment."

They participated in one way or another in the World War II- in our experience, however remote to-to these\u2014 to my experience. And it was too close and too unpleasant, and I think they just didn\u2019t want themselves, they didn\u2019t want to dwell on it. Just like I didn\u2019t want to dwell on the past, people in general, I think, immediately after the war, didn\u2019t want to do that. Not exclusively, but I think there was the general sense."

I think I\u2019ve changed since I\u2019ve been at the museum, after I retired, that I can rationally, logically see the need for such purpose, to disclose. And (1) that influences my responding to talks. Now I am officially part of the Speakers Bureau, but it doesn\u2019t mean that I talk every week or repeat myself. I still try to keep that to kind of a modest frequency."

            "answer": "I joined the museum as a volunteer basically after I retired. I retired in 1998, and here I am always interested in doing something, hopefully something productive, something new, and the question is what I was going to do. I thought that my work the last period in-in my\u2014 1n our own business, where I was (excuse me) very much involved in new developments in our area (this microbiological testing), that I would want to continue with it, because I could see there 1s a lot of need there. But I very quickly found out that I was out of it, that this was no longer my environment. And being an engineer, I was not really immediately considered part https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 1 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 6 of the microbiological community. So I needed to\u2014 I abandoned that altogether within probably like six months, and started to look around. So I volunteered at the Holocaust Museum here in Washington, and I\u2014 because of my knowledge of languages (I know Yiddish and I know Hebrew, and I think, some English), they assigned to me at the archives a recently received collection from Kovno, which is where I come from in Lithuania. And I found that Yiddish, even though I had not spoken or used it for close to 60 years, that it was still there; and I could be refreshing it and applying it usefully to this document collection, because it happened to be from Kovno, which is\u2014 And I was like in the Kovno ghetto. So that got my interest, and this led to a number of projects over the years that kept me interesting\u2014interested."

            "question": "What happened when you stepped into that world?",
            "answer": "Well, the first- One thing that I mentioned is to discover my knowledge or awareness or\u2014 of Yiddish, of the language. But to me, Yiddish was\u2014 I knew it because it was spoken at home, but it was not central to my life as I was growing up, because I belonged to a Zionist organization and where Hebrew was the language of discourse, and I attended a Hebrew gymnasium, which means everything was taught in Hebrew. So literature was Hebrew literature. So Yiddish, I-I could see\u2014 I could re-recover it, just by working at it. And of course the test came when I came across this one document in this\u2014 It was the\u2014a collection of documents from the Kovno ghetto police. And I had some encounters with the ghetto police when I was there briefly. So that kind of was of interest. And what they were describing in this document, which was in Yiddish, quite extensive, typewritten, 250 pages, what they called a History of the Kovno Ghetto Jewish Police, that they were describing this what was going on, and some of it obviously rang a bell, even though I had really blocked out some of the unpleasant details, or even re\u2014 normal details, but\u2014 So it was bringing back my background, and it was shedding a different light on how I was thinking about it. And I thought that this document in particular, because it was treated not very well https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 1 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 7 in the Holocaust literature\u2014 Actually only one historian who was excerpt- excerpting from it and writing about it; I thought he had a very wrong point of view, even though he also came from the Kovno ghetto. So I thought that this document had to be\u2014 had to become public, that it was an important addition to describing what life actually was like in\u2014 from a people\u2019s point of view, in, say, in the Kovno ghetto, and by-by extension, to in other places which had similar conditions."

            "answer": "[overlap] Yes, 1t was exciting. I don\u2019t know if it was emotional. Some of the detailed description which corresponded to my description might have been emotional. But when you work at it for a while and repeat (you know) this going through these experiences, the emotional aspect tends to be reduced. So I embarked on translating it. Now, this was not as part of the-my museum activities, because I decided that on my own. So I made this my\u2014 another project of my own. And I would say that in-in the process of doing it, I recovered a good part of my Yiddish knowledge, because it was not there but it had to be retraced, whether it\u2019s through dictionaries or through participating in reading groups. So it served these two purposes\u2014one intended, the other one not\u2014that I did translate. It took me a couple years."

            "question": "You said it shed new light on your own experience. What did that mean?",
            "answer": "Well, I can illustrate it. I and my mother were taken off the street in the Kovno ghetto by a Jewish policeman, following the directive from the elder council and the Nazi rulers .. to provide them like 500 workers for the re\u2014 for the Riga ghetto (Riga, the capital of Latvia, not that far from Kovno). And of course nobody volunteered for that, because there has not\u2014 had not been any selections until that time. They did not end in the ditches of the Ninth Fort, which was the killing grounds of the Kovno ghetto. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 1 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 8 So the police picked up people wherever they could, and my mother and I didn\u2019t manage to escape them. And they took us down to this\u2014the square, the center square in the ghetto, where they were collecting those to be transported to Riga. And in-in that square, there was the detail of the Jewish policemen which was led by a man called Michael Bronson, who happened to be my high school teacher of Lithuanian just 6 or 9 months before that. And I knew him personally because we had extracurricular connections. And so I thought, \u201cWell, he\u2019ll\u2014 he can help me. (you know) He knows me.\u201d And he didn\u2019t. Didn\u2019t do anything. And my mother and I were taken away. So I kind of\u2014 (you know) I held it against him. I says, \u201cHow- (I mean) I\u2019m not just anybody. I\u2019m his student, his pupil.\u201d Well, reading what was actually happening, how this-this transport was assembled, there\u2019s nothing he could do, because the SS were right there with him, and he\u2014 I thought that 1t was his job to select who would go and who wouldn\u2019t go, and that was not true either. Everybody who was collected was going to go. So it-it illustrated that my perspective at the time was anything but complete on the background, what was going on. And there are some other instances like that."

And people would take a position like I did, (you know) that these were traitors, (you know) they just didn\u2019t care about anybody else. And yet when you read it, you find out that it\u2019s not that simple. And for that reason I felt it needed to be publicized so people can make their own decisions by getting both sides of the story.

So to relate atrocities and to give people a sense just how awful this thing was, was the\u2014 was the purpose of-of talking about. See. So you look what (you know) hatred and bias can bring about. But I think when I got involved in it more deeply, at the museum, it changed in this respect: that I thought it\u2019s not as simple a-a historical event that could be reduced to the extent of the atrocities. There is more to it. And particularly if you want to try to understand it, which is not simple, you have to look further and deeper into it. Not\u2014 I can\u2019t say I have the answer, but I know that it needs to be addressed more than just relating just what happened."

But it changed, but in part because of my other interests in dealing with it. Like I mentioned, it had to be\u2014 I had to address something\u2014 a new angle or something before I was interested in dealing with it, whether it\u2019s to publish something or to talk about it. So it was the need for this new angle that brought me, for example now, as of my most recent (you know) talk that I gave, that I [would] not going to focus on my experiences; that my experiences are the background for what I want to talk about, but what I decided I would explore a little more is the people that I encountered in\u2014 during my experiences. Because there are these broad categorizations of (you know) perpetrators and collaborators and bystanders and so on and so on, that are much too broad. They don\u2019t bring up real people and try to shed some light: how did they\u2014 how did they become what they became? And so this is what I-I did last time, and this gives me the added interest that I need to keep talk about it, because https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 1 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 10 it\u2019s a new angle and it\u2019s not (you know) just my experience, and how good or bad it was, but the particular people. And there are a variety of them. And they do or they don\u2019t fit in these categories that I thought might be more useful in trying to understand at least some aspects of how the Holocaust came about. [Tape 2]"

(you know) Did I actually (you know) experience this? And on that part (you know) you can conclude that yes, it brings something back, but it does not really affect me that much. But on an emotional level, it does. It could bring back the fears or the anxieties associated with those experiences. And that can show up in any number of ways. The concern that something bad is about to happen, that you can get that sense for no-no good reason, really. But any event that you start worrying about (you know) suddenly can get out of proportion. And of course in the dreams that you get, the nature of these dreams become more disturbing.

For-for a while when I was working on this, and being\u2014 (you know) volunteering at the Holocaust Museum, and being retired makes a big difference, because when you\u2019re not retired, when you\u2019re involved in all kinds of activities that are very important to you, whether professionally or from a livelihood point of view, that\u2019s a great distraction. You don\u2019t\u2014 You don\u2019t have time or interest to dwell on these things. But when you\u2019re retired, these distractions are not there, which some people say that that makes the golden years, but I doubt that. So the distractions are not there, and then add to this that what I chose as a replacement for it is to work on Holocaust matters. So it was a bad combination. And (f) so there was some kind of depression that would lurk in the background, and every now and then (you know) come out more strongly. So I consulted some medical people, and I ended up about a year ago on what is called, I guess, an antidepressant. And that makes a big difference. So there is a medical way to deal with it."

Like if I have a need (you know) to try and develop something new to be productive in some way, that was an important part of the\u2014 what we\u2019d refer to as the earlier professional kind of distractions or family needs. So it\u2019s-it\u2019s that part that goes away, and now you\u2019re looking for a replacement for it. What can I do (you know) that maybe is new? It\u2019s not (you know) that (you know) known, and would be useful. So\u2014 And I was working in the\u2014 in the Holocaust area. So I naturally ended up doing just that, looking for like\u2014 There\u2019re other small kind of things that happened, like in this manuscript. It\u2019s been moving very slowly in the publication area. The Holocaust Museum presumably is trying to publish it, but it\u2019s not at the top of their agenda. And there is another complication that came about with it, in that there was a man who also was in the Kovno ghetto, decided that his uncle, who he lived with in the ghetto, is the author of this whole manuscript, because he saw him sitting at the typewriter at night. And that was standing in the way of the museum moving ahead. (you know) They had to somehow sort it out or make a deal with him or something. And so I started to look into the manuscript in a lot more detail for the purpose of trying to identify a little better who produced this document. And I think I succeeded in showing, with some kind of factual information\u2014from page sequences, from looking at this document almost page by page, and finding out wherever there was a reference to when this particular page was written, to produce a timeline of the creation of this document, all kinds of background information for it. And I think\u2014 I came to the conclusion, which I think is reasonable, that this was not a one-man (you know) operation; that this was an organized effort of the police https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 2 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 16 department, starting from the top. And there is, I think, good\u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say justification, but good\u2014 You can make the connection and show that this is really what it was. And I thought, here is something. I was able to come up with something new, and it was also useful here. So there are opportunities like that. But that\u2019s the sort of thing I would be looking for."

I think at one time I was interviewed and I said that it\u2019s\u2014 having friends was important, that you can\u2019t survive by yourself. And that\u2019s, I think, an important ingredient. But I would also say that there\u2019s something else more fundamental that\u2019s involved, and that is the-the desire to live, the need to live. Is nothing rational about it. I think to me, I\u2019m not in that particular branch of science, but I would say it\u2019s like in your DNA.

            "question": "The primal quality of survival.",
            "answer": "Well, this\u2014 That there is a irrational angle to attempting to survive. And like I was starting to say about the people I read, that in eastern Poland, that were\u2014 they were told, there\u2019s going to be three transports, certain dates, and of course the Nazis wouldn\u2019t say where it was going, but it was well known to the people that they\u2019re heading for the extermination camp, whether it was Treblinka or what have you. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 2 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 17 And they described that there was no great emotional outbursts; that they were going about packing their things. What should they take? What shouldn\u2019t they take? And their rationale was that it just couldn\u2019t be that-that they would be taken by other human beings and just killed. So there must be (you know) something else that would happen. There had to be a rational basis for doing what they were doing, and here they were doing nothing because there\u2019s nothing that they could do. So if you take that (you know) into other situations, I have (you know) my own examples, like when we were taken from Kovno to Riga, at the-this assembly place, when I saw my teacher, I kind of shouted to him, although I\u2019m not very loud. I said that I wanted to live. And he of course didn\u2019t hear any of it. But my mother was-was standing next to me, and I\u2019m sure she heard. So that when we were on our way to-to the railroad station, we\u2019re going up a hill there in town, I heard her going behind me, and at one spot she says, \u201cRun,\u201d (you know) \u201crun.\u201d And I looked at what she was pointing at, and I saw this street of Lithuanians going about their daily business, and it didn\u2019t look like an environment that is conducive to escape. I didn\u2019t know any Lithuanians; the ones I knew or heard about were not friendly; so I didn\u2019t run. I thought, maybe there will be other opportunities. Maybe this is indeed not the selection of the known variety. And so there was this rational kind of almost risk assessment. (you know) Is this a reasonable risk to take? And in my mind it wasn\u2019t. And some friends who later heard about it, who\u2019re in the psychology business, said I wasn\u2019t ready to abandon my mother\u2014which all of this may be true. But there was a\u2014 some rational aspect to it. On the other hand, at the end of the war, when I did escape from-from the column that were being marched out of Magdeburg, and that was a reasonable risk, because we knew that the Americans are already nearby, and the Russians are nearby, and there\u2019s a fair chance (you know) that if we managed to escape, that this would be successful. So there is not only the will, the need, the desire to live, but there is a rational approach (you know) to choosing the risks that you\u2019re taking or not taking. And many people of course who had the same desire to survive maybe chose risks that weren\u2019t good. And others didn\u2019t choose at all, gave up. So there is this\u2014 again this-this complexity. But I think the fundamental need that needs to try https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 2 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 18 to survive is there. And you can see that in poor countries and\u2014 where people put up with an awful lot of unpleasantness, just to live. Not a very good life, but they need\u2014 they want to live."

And because of my Zionist background, I wanted to go to Palestine after the war\u2014even though, through my actual connections to people I met, especially one American officer who was doing a lot for me, who was arranging a visa for me to come to the United States, which he did arrange. And I said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s not where I want to go.\u201d And I was making arrangements to go with this illegal immigration to Palestine. And so the first boat that I- that my friend Harry actually took, also helped by the same lieutenant, went, I think in March \u2019\u00b046, and I didn\u2019t\u2014 I wasn\u2019t going to go with that. But then we found out that the British were holding\u2014 were stopping all the boats with illegal immigrants and https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 3 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 30 putting them in a camp in Cyprus. So the advice given to me is that you have\u2014 you can go to the United States. Why don\u2019t you go to the US and wait there? It\u2019s better than being in another camp in Cyprus. So that\u2019s what I did a few months later, in July of 46, that I came here. But I immediately (almost, within a month or two) volunteered for the draft, because officially World War II was not over on the books. So if you served in the Army, you could get a GI Bill of Rights. And so I went into the Army, a volunteer, got basic training in field artillery, and then they shipped me out to Korea, and they put me in the counterintelligence corps there. And 10 months after my entering the Army, all draftees were released from service. And that of course put me in a better status as far as citizenship. I was\u2014 I served in the Army. I could get it [in something] like 2 or 3 years instead of 5 years. But I had my first papers still. I was not a citizen. But I could study\u2014 [Tape 4]"

But the better part of 1t was that I could study in any accredited college. And the Institute of Technology in Haifa, Palestine, was an accredited college. So within a year of coming here to the United States, I was in Palestine, in Haifa, studying at the\u2014 at the Technion. And I got involved because the war of independence started, and I served there, first in the Hagannah, then in the Israel Defense Forces. But when that was over, I came back to the United States to continue my studies here. And I got my citizenship soon afterwards. So I had my education, I was a citizen, I felt very much at home here, and appreciative (you know) of the opportunities here. I did not regret leaving Palestine and coming here. Obviously I preferred it, because I had had a taste (you know) of life in the United States, the people relationships.

I was unconscious, so if I was being liberated, I had no idea that that was the case. And being in the German hospital was kind of\u2014 They were Germans, you know. Is this liberation? Of course it had very positive aspects, being in that hospital. So it was only after I was released from the hospital, and went outside, and it happened to be the hospital on the edge of town, and I was not going to go into town. I wanted out, away from all this. So I went into the fields, a road going to the next village or town, whatever it would be. And it was a spring day, beautiful day, and you were in nature. I hadn\u2019t been in nature for years. And I felt (you know) free in a sense that I did not have to fear for my life. There is no-no danger looming around the corner, because the Nazis are gone. The Germans in the hospital maybe didn\u2019t like my presence there, but they sure weren\u2019t mistreating me. In fact, a~a German nurse 1n a white coat would bring me food on a tray. (you know) Well, that\u2019s not concentration camp. But another aspect of it is, aside from not being\u2014 not fearing for your life, 1s this notion that you are alone. And that was not a threatening thing. That was the opposite, because the experience in ghettos and in camps is that you\u2019re never alone. Particularly in the concentration camp, the\u2014 whether it\u2019s the kapos or SS, are on top of you every minute of the day and night.

            "answer": "Well, from the (you know) broad perspective, I don\u2019t know. People say that it was important. It set up standards of what can or cannot be done by governments and in wartime. My own perspective is not quite satisfying. I mean, it\u2019s one thing to see the top leadership, (you know) the Nazi, and 10 or 20 of them being (you know) hanged. That\u2019s fine. But I was looking more for the people at the level that I had encountered. And those were not the philosophers, the theoreticians. They were ordinary\u2014 not ordinary, I hope, but plain people who happened to be either sadistic or murderous, and then you go up from there to the higher levels, who were not actually doing\u2014 They didn\u2019t pull the trigger; they supervised those who did. I wanted to see some of those. The only one that I did come across (and I just actually checked it recently) was one man in Kaiserwald, was Dr. Krepsbach who was the medical officer and whose job was the selections. And I had a direct encounter with him. And it turns out that he was tried before a war crimes tribunal, but not for what he did 1n-in Kaiserwald. Before he came to Kaiserwald, he was in Mauthausen. And that was supposedly the worst inside Germany, the camps, with a lot of medical experiments. And he was (med) one of the medical officers there, and he was tried and convicted and executed. So fine, he was executed, for what I\u2014 in my mind, it\u2019s also for what he did in Kaiserwald. But it didn\u2019t reach down. The war crimes tribunals didn\u2019t reach down. Was just too many. There were thousands of people who committed these war crimes. And it was stopped at a certain level. They went for the higher ups, not for those who actually committed the direct atrocities."

And I looked upon him (he was older, was a graduate chemist) as he was in charge of our total family, looking out for us. And then I looked around and they were all gone. They went into some place, and he didn\u2019t look for us or look after us. He was just taking care of his-his family. And so they stayed on, and we were\u2014 we were trapped.
