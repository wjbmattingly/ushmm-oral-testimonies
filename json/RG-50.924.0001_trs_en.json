But to me, Yiddish was\u0152 I knew it because it was spoken at home, but it was not central to my life as I was growing up, because I belonged to a Zionist orga nization and where Hebrew was the language of discourse, and I attended a Hebrew gymnasium, which means everything was taught in Hebrew. So literature was Hebrew literature. So Yiddish, I-I could see\u0152 I could rerecover it, just by working at it. And of co urse the test came when I came across this one document in this \u0152 It was the \u0152a collection of documents from the Kovno ghetto police. And I had some encounters with the ghetto police when I was there briefly. So that kind of was of interest. And what they were describing in this document, which was in Yiddish, quite extensive, typewritten, 250 pages, what they called a History of the Kovno Ghetto Jewish Police, that they were describing this what was going on, and some of it obviously rang a bell, even though I had really blocked out some of the unpleasant details, or even re \u0152 normal details, but\u0152 So it was bringing back my background, and it was shedding a different light on how I was thinking about it. And I thought that this document in particular, because it was treated not very well Tape 1 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 7 in the Holocaust literature \u0152 Actually only one historian who was excerptexcerpting from it and writing about it; I thought he had a very wrong point of view, even though he also came from the Kovno ghetto. So I thought that th is document had to be\u0152 had to become public, that it was an important addition to describing what life actually was like in \u0152 from a people\u2122s point of view, in, say, in the Kovno ghetto, and by-by extension, to in other places which had similar conditions."

And I would say that in-in the process of doing it, I recovered a good part of my Yiddish knowledge, because it was not there but it had to be retraced, whether it\u2122s through dictionaries or through participating in reading groups.

And of course nobody volunteered for that, because there has not\u0152 had not been any selections until that time. They did not end in the ditches of the Ninth Fort, which was the killing grounds of the Kovno ghetto. Tape 1 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 8 So the police picked up people wherever they could, and my mother and I didn\u2122t manage to escape them. And they took us down to this\u0152 the square, the center square in the ghetto, where they were collecting those to be transported to Riga. And inin that square, there was the detail of the Jewish policemen which was led by a man called Michael Bronson, who happened to be my high school teacher of Lithuanian just 6 or 9 months before that. And I knew him personally because we had extracurricular connections. And so I thought, \ufb01Well, he\u2122ll\u0152 he can help me. (you know) He knows me.\ufb02 And he didn\u2122t. Didn\u2122t do anything. And my mother and I were taken away. So I kind of\u0152 (you know) I held it against him. I says, \ufb01How\u0152 (I mean) I\u2122m not just anybody. I\u2122m his student, his pupil.\ufb02 Well, reading what was actually happening , how thisthis transport was assembled, there\u2122s nothing he could do, because the SS were right there with him, and he\u0152 I thought that it was his job to select who would go and who wouldn\u2122t go, and that was not true either. Everybody who was collected was going to go. So itit illustrated that my perspective at the time was anything but complete on the background, what was going on.

Like I mentioned, it had to be\u0152 I had to address something\u0152 a new angle or something before I was interested in dealing with it, whether it\u2122s to publish something or to talk about it. So it was the need for this new angle that brought me, for example now, as of my most recent (you know) talk that I gave, that I [would] not going to focus on my experiences; that my experiences are the background for what I want to talk about, but what I decided I would explore a little more is the people that I encountered in \u0152 during my experiences. Because there are these broad categorizations of (you know) perpetrators and collaborators and bystanders and so on and so on, that are much too broad. They don\u2122t bring up real people and try to shed some light: how did they\u0152 how did they become what they became? And so this is what II did last time, and this gives me the added interest that I need to keep talk about it, because Tape 1 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 10 it\u2122s a new angle and it\u2122s not (you know) just my experience, and how good or bad it was, but the particular people. And there are a variety of them. And they do or they don\u2122t fit in these categories that I thought might be more useful in trying to understand at least some aspects of how the Holocaust came about. [Tape 2]"

Like if I have a need (you know) to try and develop something new to be productive in some way, that was an important part of the\u0152 what we\u2122d refer to as the earlier profes sional kind of distractions or family needs. So it\u2122sit\u2122s that part that goes away, and now you\u2122re looking for a replacement for it. What can I do (you know) that maybe is new? It\u2122s not (you know) that (you know) known, and would be useful. So\u0152 And I was w orking in the\u0152 in the Holocaust area. So I naturally ended up doing just that, looking for like\u0152 There\u2122re other small kind of things that happened, like in this manuscript. It\u2122s been moving very slowly in the publication area. The Holocaust Museum presumably is trying to publish it, but it\u2122s not at the top of their agenda. And there is another complication that came about with it, in that there was a man who also was in the Kovno ghetto, decided that his uncle, who he lived with in the ghetto, is the autho r of this whole manuscript, because he saw him sitting at the typewriter at night. And that was standing in the way of the museum moving ahead. (you know) They had to somehow sort it out or make a deal with him or something. And so I started to look into the manuscript in a lot more detail for the purpose of trying to identify a little better who produced this document. And I think I succeeded in showing, with some kind of factual information sequences, from looking at this document almost page by page, and finding out wherever there was a reference to when this particular page was written, to produce a timeline of the creation of this document, all kinds of background information fo r it. And I think\u0152 I came to the conclusion, which I think is reasonable, that this was not a one-man (you know) operation; that this was an organized effort of the police Tape 2 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 16 department, starting from the top. And there is, I think, good\u0152 I wouldn\u2122t say justi fication, but good\u0152 You can make the connection and show that this is really what it was. And I thought, here is something. I was able to come up with something new, and it was also useful here. So there are opportunities like that. But that\u2122s the sort of thing I would be looking for."

Perhaps every time it\u2122s asked, I come up with a different possibility. I think at one time I was interviewed and I said that it\u2122s \u0152 having friends was important, that you can\u2122t survive by yourself. And that\u2122s, I think, an important ingredient. But I would also say that there\u2122s something else more fundamental that\u2122s involved, and that is thethe desire to live, the need to live. Is nothing rational about it. I think to me, I\u2122m not in that particular branch of science, but I would say it\u2122s like in your DNA. And you can\u2122t help yourself that you struggle, because otherwise, if you look what people went through, and for how long they went through, and still looked for ways (you know) to survive the day, I think there\u2122s a lot to that, that \u0152 And then of course everybody will say luck plays a role. But you have to put yourself in a position where luck can play a role. So I think this drive is -is there, and it was there to many people.

            "question": "The primal quality of survival.",
            "answer": "Well, this \u0152 That there is a irrational angle to attempting to survive. And like I was starting to say about the people I read, that in eastern Poland, that were\u0152 they were told, there\u2122s going to be three transports, certain dates, and of course the Nazis wouldn\u2122t say where it was going, but it was well known to the people that they\u2122re heading for the extermination camp, whether it was Treblinka or what have you. Tape 2 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 17 And they described that there was no great emotional out bursts; that they were going about packing their things. What should they take? What shouldn\u2122t they take? And their rationale was that it just couldn\u2122t be that -that they would be taken by other human beings and just killed. So there must be (you know) something else that would happen. There had to be a rational basis for doing what they were doing, and here they were doing nothing because there\u2122s nothing that they could do. So if you take that (you know) into other situations, I have (you know) my own examp les, like when we were taken from Kovno to Riga, at thethis assembly place, when I saw my teacher, I kind of shouted to him, although I\u2122m not very loud. I said that I wanted to live. And he of course didn\u2122t hear any of it. But my mother was -was standing next to me, and I\u2122m sure she heard. So that when we were on our way to -to the railroad station, we\u2122re going up a hill there in town, I heard her going behind me, and at one spot she says, \ufb01Run,\ufb02 (you know) \ufb01run.\ufb02 And I looked at what she was pointing at, and I saw this street of Lithuanians going about their daily business, and it didn\u2122t look like an environment that is conducive to escape. I didn\u2122t know any Lithuanians; the ones I knew or heard about were not friendly; so I didn\u2122t run. I thought, maybe there will be other opportunities. Maybe this is indeed not the selection of the known variety. And so there was this rational kind of almost risk assessment. (you know) Is this a reasonable risk to take? And in my mind it wasn\u2122t. And some friends who later heard about it, who\u2122re in the psychology business, said I wasn\u2122t ready to abandon my mother But there was a \u0152 some rational aspect to it. On the other hand, at the end of the war, when I did escape fromfrom the column that were being marched out of Magdeburg, and that was a reasonable risk, because we knew that the Americans are already nearby, and the Russians are nearby, and there\u2122s a fair chance (you know) that if we managed to escape, that this would be successful. So there is not only the will, the need, the desire to live, but there is a rational approach (you know) to choosing the risks that you\u2122re taking or not taking. And many people of course who had the same desire to survive maybe chose risks that weren\u2122t good. And others didn\u2122t choose at all, gave up. So there is this \u0152 again this-this complexity. But I think the fundamental need that needs to try Tape 2 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 18 to survive is there. And you can see that in poor countries and\u0152 where people put up with an awful lot of unpleasantness, just to live. Not a very good life, but they need \u0152 they want to live."

I had a brother and two sisters still there after \u0152 immediately aft er the war. And because of my Zionist background, I wanted to go to Palestine after the war met, especially one American officer who was doing a lot for me, who was arranging a visa for me to come to the United States, which he did arrange. And I said, \ufb01Well, that\u2122s not where I want to go.\ufb02 And I was making arrangements to go with this illegal immigration to Palestine. And so the first boat that I \u0152 that my friend Harry actually took, also helped by the same lieutenant, went, I think in March \u212246, and I didn\u2122t\u0152 I wasn\u2122t going to go with that. But then we found out that the British were holding \u0152 were stopping all the boats with illegal immigrants and Tape 3 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 30 putting them in a camp in Cyprus. So the advice given to me is that you have\u0152 you can go to the United States. Why don\u2122t you go to the US and wait there? It\u2122s better than being in another camp in Cyprus. So that\u2122s what I did a few months later, in July of \u212246, that I came here. But I immediately (almost, within a month or two) volunteered for the draft, because officially World War II was not over on the books. So if you served in the Army, you could get a GI Bill of Rights. And so I went into the Army, a volunteer, got basic training in field artillery, and then they shipped me out to Korea, and they put me in the counterintelligence corps there. And 10 months after my entering the Army, all draftees were released from service. And that of course put me in a better status as far as citizenship. I was \u0152 I served in the Army.

But the better part of it was that I could study in any accredited college. And the Institute of Technology in Haifa, Palestine, was an accredited college. So within a year of coming here to the United States, I was in Palestine, in Haifa, studying at the\u0152 at the Technion. And I got involved because the war of independence started, and I served there, first in the Hagannah, then in the Israel Defense Forces. But when that was over, I came bac k to the United States to continue my studies here. And I got my citizenship soon afterwards. So I had my education, I was a citizen, I felt very much at home here, and appreciative (you know) of the opportunities here. I did not regret leaving Palestine and coming here.

I was unconscious, so if I was being liberated, I had no idea that that was the case. And being in the German hospital was kind of\u0152 They were Germans, you know. Is this liberation? Of course it had very positive aspects, being in that hospital. So it was only after I was released from the hospital, and went outside, and it happened to be the hospital on the edge of town, and I was not going to go into town. I wanted out, away from all this. So I went into the fields, a road going to the next village or town, whatever it would be. And it was a spring day, beautiful day, and you were in nature. I hadn\u2122t been in nature for years. And I felt (you know) free in a sense that I did not have to fear for my life. There is no-no danger looming around the corner, because the Nazis are gone. The Germans in the hospital maybe didn\u2122t like my presence there, but they sure weren\u2122t mistreating me. In fact, a\u0152a German nurse in a white coat would bring me food on a tray. (you know) Well, that\u2122s not concentration camp. But another aspect of it is, aside from not being\u0152 not fe aring for your life, is this notion that you are alone. And that was not a threatening thing. That was the opposite, because the experience in ghettos and in camps is that you\u2122re never alone. Particularly in the concentration camp, the \u0152 whether it\u2122s the ka pos or SS, are on top of you every minute of the day and night. So not to have anybody, and not to have to worry about it, was something that was very, very different. And that\u2122s what I considered to be really my experience of freedom.

And to be part of that work group was very desirable because you had acces s to -to clothing. And I had worked in-in the Riga ghetto in the air force clothing warehouse, where I learned a few things, how to handle and warehouse and sort and whatnot the clothing.

But how do you deal with an SS man like Oberscharf\u00fchrer Fischer? So I figured, Max has been dealing with him; I\u2122ll watch him and see what he does. And I noticed that what he was doing, that whenever Fischer addressed him in any way, or told him anything to do, or what have you, he would snap to attention, click his heels (you know) and respond loudly, \ufb01Ja wohl, Herr Oberscharf\u00fchrer.\ufb02 So I says, \ufb01Well, that\u2122s what you have to do.
