When he passed the last building, the street in front of him was deserted and he was close to pass the last building; he decided to escape.

There was a whistle, very, very loud whistle in the courtyard and voice very, very harsh, and very, very loud ordering people to take his belongings, to take small belongings, going down to the court.

He tried to pretend to be strong man and my father said I will kill you right here if you don\u2019t let me pass you and he gave up. But it was only the beginning of hunting.

If the bill won\u2019t be paid today, I will have to turn off the telephone. The bill, it was sort of interesting thing for history of ghetto, the bills were not paid from ghetto because the post office didn\u2019t exist anymore. So it was a trap, Catch 22. My father called his friend out of ghetto and he went and paid the bill so we had a telephone. The telephone saved the life of many people. Because people could contact the outside world and make contacts, make arrangements and save their life. It saved our loves too by -- just by sheer accident. Somebody called -- people made the meeting place in our house. Meeting place and they waited for message from outside world that were supposed to come through our telephone. It was crowded, our house became very crowded then. Nobody from our family except us were still living but new people came from all over ghetto, whoever knew that there\u2019s such an apartment with telephone.

I will give you a helping hand but I can\u2019t help you to get out of ghetto. It was some hope for my father who looked like 100 Jews in one, you know, in person. Little by little, we left the ghetto through groups who worked outside the ghetto. They were counted by people and they were able to manage, to leave somebody outside. They bribed Polish policemen or whoever, I don\u2019t know exactly. It was a big business. They made, it was a way of making money in those days.

In the beginning, we used to go to the same ceiling where we stayed first time. Later on it was, oh, later on, we, for some reason, I don\u2019t remember why, those small ceilings became dangerous. My father, maybe there was no time. We spent nights at home without light, only in the dark to wash ourselves, to get something to eat. In daytime, we didn\u2019t stay in our apartment. We stayed in the lumber factory. The lumber factory was in the back of the courtyard, our lot. Whoever survived those first -- whoever was alive stayed there. People talked and people -- I met very, very interesting people over there. They were always in love, I was fourteen and I was always in love. Since young men were mostly militia men so I was always in love with some militia man. I found, since I was only 14 and not a woman but a child, we were very good friends. They used to talk to me about this all. They were very strange people. You don\u2019t know how far hypocrisy can go into the soul of people, they were murderers. They were helping hands of murderers. Every day they murdered hundreds of people but they didn\u2019t feel guilty. They always did it for some better reason, to save their mother, to save their somebody, to help someone survive. It was interesting experience to talk to those people. One day I was very close to death, the closest in my life, I never was so close o be caught like that. The raid came suddenly with no -- we had no time to hide. Somebody took my sister, a four- year old child with me and put lumber in front; put me between lumber, between boards, lumber boards. The Germans or Ukrainians whoever they were, chasers, came and one board after another, they took away. They were very, very close and my sister didn\u2019t, she fell asleep. She could wake up any second and they were so -- only one board was between us and them. They went away and it was over. Once one of those, I don\u2019t know who were, who exactly who were, nationality is the wrong way to tell about them because they were from many, many nationalities.

Nobody -- it was hard to find any place to be safe for longer than a few weeks, or a few months, there was always something. January 17 of 1943, our friends found places for us with a family who kept us from -- till the end of the war. So we spent there two years. I lived like Anne Frank, in the hiding. I didn\u2019t go out, I didn\u2019t see; we saw only people who -- very, very, selected people who could come over and visit us. Our contact with the outside world was very limited. We had one room, we lived together in one room, my parents and me. My sister was with foster family if you can call it. Some friends of our family took my sister and she lived like -- almost normal life in the suburban, in Milanowek, in the suburbs of Warsaw. With small children around because her foster parents had small children. First six months that I lived out of ghetto --. The worst thing was my contact, my encounter with the Aryan world, with the Warsaw that didn\u2019t exist for me, with the normal people, normal life, normal life. People who had different scale value and different needs. I couldn\u2019t, it was very hard to adjust. People who took me, the first people who took me and I spend few weeks with them, were cousins of my -- , the nearest cousin of my mother. But they were transformed, they were different people. They pretended not to be Jewish; they still pretend. They were completely different people. I had nothing in common with them. Everything turned, our friendship, our love, didn\u2019t survive the war. We didn\u2019t, we are not friends any more. It\u2019s hard to say what happened, what happened was that they tried to become like other people. They tried to live in petty, small, petty problems. I left my parents in ghetto and I didn\u2019t know if they were still alive. I couldn\u2019t care for small things, I was one important burden that I --.Well, I wasn\u2019t alone over there because cousins, our cousin took another cousin who was young; I was 14, he was 17. Since the life, normal life and sun and smiling people and chitchat and things like that didn\u2019t -- were so distant to us, we used to keep together. We tried to be, well, there was --.

I don\u2019t remember any conversation, any special conversation with him. My cousin, my aunt or my cousin told me that this is a very inappropriate thing for a young girl to be alone with a young man with no --. It was such a stupid thing. I was really -- I felt terribly isolated. I felt terribly isolated because I didn\u2019t belong to the world that she wanted to belong. Her father was in ghetto and he was one of those constant boarders who always used to spend days with us. She never asked about him. She wasn\u2019t interested. It was sort of self -- self defense. I am sure now she wanted to be like other people. She didn\u2019t want to have father in ghetto dying in there, or maybe already dead, or in a transport in a - to Treblinka. She didn\u2019t want it but I didn\u2019t want to listen about her new dress or a new fur or something like this. So I was very, very unhappy. I was unhappy but I don\u2019t think I had the courage to say something. I really don\u2019t know. A few weeks later, they found a place for me to stay. It was in the Warsaw suburbs; I don\u2019t remember even the name of the -- I forgot the name but it doesn\u2019t matter. The man who took me, took me only for money. He was an alcoholic. He treated his family very badly. They lived in very bad -- they were very primitive people. But I don\u2019t think they were -- they weren\u2019t brutal, they didn\u2019t do anything bad, anything cruel for me. They were such a simpleton. My mother visited me there. My mother didn\u2019t talk and didn\u2019t trust, instinctively didn\u2019t trust our cousins. She noticed the transformation; they were different people and she didn\u2019t know how far they are able to go. Something opened, something different; they were very close relatives and very close friends. But something strange, strange feelings and mistrust, opened between my mother and my cousins. So they didn\u2019t want to tell my mother where I am. At last my mother came. I have to tell you about how my mother left ghetto. I will finish this, okay? "

I couldn\u2019t even be happy. It was -- I didn\u2019t feel my mother was coming. I was like a living -- like somebody sucked away my feelings. It took some time, not very long, maybe half an hour, maybe 15 minutes, before I started to feel happiness and then it was absolutely great feeling to have my mother again. Because I didn\u2019t think that we could survive. I left, no. This is something that I never told anybody. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s very loyal to tell about other people. To tell how disaster makes people, divide people, divide close people --. When I was in my cousins\u2019 apartment, 1t wasn\u2019t -- not very big apartment; other people helped my parents to get out -- of ghetto. They -- the telephone -- I said that the telephone was still working. The ghetto almost didn\u2019t exist but the telephone was working. So one of my father\u2019s, my parents\u2019 friends came over and told me Dzidzia please, I want to talk in private with Lilusia. Lilusia was cousin. I don\u2019t want you to be here because I have to tell something. We have some things that grown-up people have to talk. I left the room but I knew that it was about my parents. I put my ear into a lock and I heard everything. He told, Mr. ---- I am saying his words. He said \u201cWladek, (my father) he\u2019s crazy. They don\u2019t have any valuables, they don\u2019t have any valuable things. They have little money, he looks like he looks and he want to leave the ghetto. He\u2019s absolutely crazy. I don\u2019t know what, I can\u2019t figure out the way of his thinking.\u201d It was quite cruel but it was the -- his intentions were good. He didn\u2019t say this because he had something against my father\u2019s survival but he knew it was unrealistic. At least I knew my father, my parents were alive. By the same way, the same groups who worked outside ghetto, were still working outside ghetto, were working for quite a long time, few months longer. First my mother, then my father were transported through ghetto borders and they were also in the working place outside the ghetto. Some friends of my parents came over and took them to their house. It was act of courage like absolute heroism. They were heroes because it was obvious for people outside the ghetto, who my parents were- the way they looked and the sort of the way they were dressed, it was absolutely obvious. But from where my parents were outside in the safe place, the other friend made first contact, who talk on the phone with my father and who gave him the idea that there\u2019s a chance for my father, took things in his hands and found a place in Milanowek, in Warsaw suburbs. My parents were in Milanowek; I moved from one place to another for a few months. Some people were nice, some people were scared; some people had tried but couldn\u2019t manage, it was too risky Sometime people around started to talk about me; that there is something strange with me, who I am, it\u2019s obvious who I am. It was obvious who I am. At last, from January 17, 1943, we were together for two years, together with my parents. Those two years weren\u2019t bad."

Because we weren\u2019t supposed to be taken to Gestapo or to be tortured because Jews were killed on the spot. Since we, little by little we had more important things to hide with us, we felt more -- our life had more value. We did something, we did something more than try to save our lives.
