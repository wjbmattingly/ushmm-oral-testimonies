When he passed the last building, the street in front of him was deserted and he was close to pass the last building; he decided to escape. I think there was sort of discussion between him and the Jewish policeman. The Jewish policeman helped him. He closed his eyes and my father escaped. He came back home and there was day almost like any other day. We started, was 2:00 or 2:30 in the afternoon and our house, or maybe more houses but I know only about our house, was surrounded by --. There was a whistle, very, very loud whistle in the courtyard and voice very, very harsh, and very, very loud ordering people to take his belongings, to take small belongings, going down to the court.

He tried to pretend to be strong ma n and my father said I will kill you right here if you don\u2122t let me pass you and he gave up. But it was only the beginning of hunting.

If the bill won\u2122t be paid today, I will have to turn off the telephone. The bill, it was sort of interesting thing for history of ghetto, the bills were not paid from ghetto because the post office didn\u2122t exist anymore. So it was a trap, Catch 22. My father called his friend out of ghetto and he went and paid the bill so we had a telephone. The telephone saved the life of many people. Because people could contac t the outside world and make contacts, make arrangements and save their life. It saved our loves too by -- just by sheer accident. Somebody called -- people made the meeting place in our house. Meeting place and they waited for message from outside world that were supposed to come through our telephone. It was crowded, our house became very crowded then. Nobody from our family except us were still living but new people came from all over ghetto, whoever knew th at there\u2122s such an apartment with telephone.

I will give you a helping hand but I can\u2122t help you to get out of ghetto. It was some hope for my father who looked like 100 Jews in one, you know, in person. Little by little, we left the ghetto through groups who worked outside the ghetto. They were counted by people and they were able to manage, to leave somebody outside. They bribed Polish policemen or whoever, I don\u2122t know exactly. It was a big business. They made, it was a way of making money in those days.

My father, maybe there wa s no time. We spent nights at home without light, only in the dark to wash ourselves, to get something to eat. In daytime, we didn\u2122t stay in our apartment.

Since young men were mostly militia men so I was always in love with some militia man. I found, since I was only 14 and not a woman but a child, we were very good friends.

            "answer": "My mother came and I went to meet he r. It was only three weeks after I left ghetto, three or four, very short time. We met on the road and I was like dead inside. I couldn\u2122t even be happy. It was -- I didn\u2122t feel my mother was coming. I was like a living -- like somebody sucked away my feelings. It took some time, not very long, maybe half an hour, maybe 15 minutes, before I started to feel happiness and then it was absolutely great feeling to have my mother again. Because I didn\u2122t think that we could survive. I left, no. This is something that I never told anybody. It\u2122s something that I\u2122m not sure if it\u2122s very loyal to tell about other people. To tell how disaster makes people, divide people, divide close people --. When I was in my cousins\u2122 apartment, it wasn\u2122t -- not very big apartment; other people helped my parents to get out -- of ghetto. They -- the telephone -- I said that the telephone was still working. The ghetto almost didn\u2122t exist but the telephone was working. So one of my father\u2122s, my parents\u2122 friends came over and told me Dzidzia please, I want to talk in private with Lilusia. Lilusia was cousin. I don\u2122t want you to be here because I have to tell something. We have some things that grown-up people have to talk. I left the room but I knew that it was about my parents. I put my ear into a lock and I heard everything. He told, Mr. ---- I am sayi ng his words. He said \ufb01Wladek, (my father) he\u2122s crazy. They don\u2122t have any valuables, they don\u2122t have any valuable things. They have little money, he looks like he looks and he want to leave the ghetto. He\u2122s absolutely crazy. I don\u2122t know what, I can\u2122t figure out the way of his thinking.\ufb02 It was quite cruel but it was the -- his intentions were good. He didn\u2122t say this because he had something ag ainst my father\u2122s survival but he knew it was unrealistic. At least I knew my father, my parents were alive. By the same way, the same groups who worked outside ghetto, were still working outside ghetto, were working for quite a long time, few months longer. First my mother, then my father were transported through ghe tto borders and they were also in the working place outside the ghetto. Some friends of my parents came over and took them to their house. It was act of courage like absolute heroism. They were heroes because it was obvious for people outside the ghetto, who my parents were -- the way they looked and the sort of the way they were dressed, it was absolutely obvious. But from where my parents were outside in the safe place, the other friend made first contact, who ta lk on the phone with my father and who gave him the idea that there\u2122s a chance for my father, took things in his hands and found a place in Milanowek, in Warsaw suburbs. My pa rents were in Milanowek; I moved from one place to another for a few months. Some people were nice, some people were scared; some people ha d tried but couldn\u2122t manage, it was too risky Sometime people around started to talk about me; that there is something strange with me, who I am, it\u2122s obvious who I am. It was obvious who I am. At last, from January 17, 1943, we were togeth er for two years, together with my parents. Those two years weren\u2122t bad."

There\u2122s no way for us to pretend that we live here, live there as tenants or something like that. But our Mr. and Mrs. Sokolowski didn\u2122t believe, didn\u2122t, took us knowing that we are a -- wait a second -- it was a death sentence. So thy built something sort of, the same thing that we had in our small barracks. They built sort of trap with covered entrance and any time they kept the house ga ted. The gate was always locked and any time somebody suspicious appeared at the gate, we\u2122re supposed to hide in the trap. We did it; we learned how to do it very quickly. It was like a drill, like a military drill. They were, they weren\u2122t like Polish people, Polish people are emotional, poorly organized. This is typical , this is what is typical in Polish culture and Polish --. But they were comp letely different. They had a very strong sense of responsibility and they knew the risk they taking and everything was perfectly well organized. Little by little, we had more and more things to take with us, a radio and arms and many, many things because we were the safest people to keep dangerous things. Because we weren\u2122t supposed to be taken to Gestapo or to be tortured because Jews were killed on the spot. Since we, little by little we had more important things to hi de with us, we felt more -- our life had more value. We did something, we did some thing more than try to save our lives. Comparing to the other people our life in hiding was very, very quiet and uneventful."

What turned out to be great, great help for his tuberculosis because this is the way that tuberculosis can be cured. So he survived. There were some bad times, sometimes he was very sick but all in all he, in the end of the war, he was much better than a few years earlier. He survived; I think what he did, he opened sort of Jewish ;place of Jewish, not council; Jewish, not gathering place; place that you learn about other people who survived."
