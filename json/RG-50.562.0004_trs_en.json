And the others -- the daughter\u2019s name was Mina. When the girls were very young, her husband, who was a teacher, died. And she had -- she was a single mother with two daughters.

And then -- now there were two -- two sisters, and we met them, with their girlfriend in the -- in the ghetto. We met them actually on that square. What happened was that the sister-in-law of Irena was there too. And I even stole two lima beans from her pot, because the people were cooking soup on the, you know, little pots. And I was so hungry, and I saw those two lima beans, and -- you know, before they were cooked, I kind of snuck them out. And what happened was -- and I th -- I forever re -- I felt guilty about it, because once the soup was cooked, she offered to each of us a plate of soup, right.

You -- you can never find out. Well, so here they are. And my girlfriend -- and my cousin Irene has a apartment. And the apartment 1s 1n the area of the ghetto. So we all go there to that apartment. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t see my father there. He must have been staying somewhere else. I -- I don\u2019t see my father there. And as we move into the apartment, a very short time after, it\u2019s on the corner of the street, Harriman and Lokietek. And it -- it faces headquarters, either of Jewish Council or the Jewish police. And all of a sudden, wi- through the window, facing it, just directly facing it, I see the S.S. loading some young Jews, pushing, and hitting, and beating, and -- Jewish policemen. And especially one. And this Jewish policeman looks like the -- the -- his executioner. He\u2019s al -- also blonde, and he looks just like him, except he has a Jewish uniform on him.

And they didn\u2019t all hang them on good ropes. They hang them on thin ropes, so the ropes will break, and the people would come down and be bloody and made to go again to be rehanged. And there was -- and last one of them was Dr. Landsberg, and he was the head of the Jewish Council. And there\u2019s a controversy about what he did or didn\u2019t do. But at this moment -- and I\u2019m - 9 I\u2019m quoting the rumors of the ghetto at that time, that they wanted to hang him, and they hanged him on a -- on this thin rope. So he was one of those who ca -- came down, and he claimed the international law that allows for mercy if somebody\u2019s rope breaks. But they only laughed at that, and -- and he -- I don\u2019t know if he had to hang himself, or somebody hanged him. I don\u2019t know if they hanged him, or if he had to hang himself. And tha -- and there were 11 people who died that way. And they were left to hang and the -- the mob would come and -- and tease and -- for everybody see, but my mother -- that\u2019s why I\u2019m sorry, I should have gone and seen, too, then I would have been a witness.

And I saw a Jew in a kapota, you know, this -- thi -- this garb, medieval garb, long garb, and the payess, and the black hat. And the -- and a policeman roughing him up a little and taking him. A-And the -- and there was no conviction in what the policeman did. He didn\u2019t do it, you could see he -- he didn\u2019t want to do it. And there was no resistance on the part of the man. He was -- he was -- I guess reconciled to his fate. And -- and he took him. And he took him wherever he took him, I didn\u2019t see that. And we were waiting for long, long time, at least three hours, and I was again doing my brooding, and that time was thinking of French Revolution. And I was thinking what it was like for the aristocrats. I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s the truth. I was thinking of French Revolution and aristocrats losing their heads, and place de la Concorde and place de Libert\u00e9 or whatever it was called then, I don\u2019t know. And -- and then I said, there is a difference. And the difference 1s that before they killed them, they announced their name, and their rank, and their place in life, and everybody knew who they were. And I said, if we die, nobody will know our name, the time of our death, nobody will know that we lived. So 3 not only our -- we -- we will meet death, but our life is going to be eliminated, we didn\u2019t live. And -- and I said that was a pretty nasty [indecipherable]. I\u2019m sure I se -- I -- I -- I shared that with my mother, I\u2019m sure. I don\u2019t know what she said, she probably thought I was crazy. Well, I was crazy, in a way. Anyway, but then what happened is by the time six 0\u2019clock came, they came, the Jewish policeman came and they said the contingent was full."

An-An -- and I was very concerned about this, because I knew that if we don\u2019t send him anything, he may not survive. And -- and so -- and I had that dream, in which my uncle comes and tells me that Uncle Emil, or cousin Emil will tell me that he\u2019s dead. And -- and so, after this -- the -- the -- this round- up 1S Over, we can come out, I tell that -- when it happened, when I dream about it, I tell it to my mother, and my mother\u2019s starting to reassure me it\u2019s only a dream. Well, it really happened. And not right away, we didn\u2019t know right -- right away. And in sequence, I remember one more hiding place. That hiding place apparently was very safe, because nobody bothered us at all. I mean, nobody knocked, nobody denounced, nobody did anything. But then we had to -- again, the ghetto was made smaller, and we had to go into another apartment. And we did, and again there was a round-up. I don\u2019t know if we had time to breathe, altogether. And again the people were -- I -- you know, people say that the people in the ghetto were terrible, but we encountered only good will. And -- and we were invited to another place to hide, and the we -- and it was very, very ingenious. But we have to remember that by that time there was -- I -- I don\u2019t think there were any p -- p- Jewish police, because as they killed the head of the Judenrat, as they killed the head of the -- they broke up the police, there was no more Jewish policemen. They -- they 9 created [indecipherable] other bodies, they created something else, but they replaced them somehow, but not as policeman. And so anyway, so this was the p -- this -- why was it so ingenious?

And SO we went into this space, and -- and shortly after, we heard knocking. And this time there were not Jewish police, there was S.S. and Gestapo, and they came with sticks, and they knocked all over the place. They knocked in the walls, they knocked in the floor. But because we were under the armoire, they did -- they couldn\u2019t hear the hollow sound, and we survived that, too. And so that was a short thing, it didn\u2019t last too long, we didn\u2019t 0 stay there too long. And we came out, and I remember that after this round-up again, the ghetto ga -- was made smaller.

The primary job was for me to wash dishes, from -- restaurant dishes. You can imagine that. And that was -- there was no machines there. So I stood forever, washing dishes, right. I-Is that -- I had an adventure washing dishes, because there was a patron who saw me washing dishes, I guess, because every -- I was here, and here the door would open and the waitress would- she was graceful waitress, she opened -- she had to -- maybe three sets of dishes 1n her- or four sets of dishes in her arms, and she would open swinging door with her leg, and she would march in there. It was a sight to see. But every time she opened the door, there was the patron sitting by the -- what\u2019s his name -- by the door, and -- and I was there, and to -- washing dishes. So one day somebody send me a rose, a beautiful rose, a perfect rose. It was fine, I -- I -- an-an-and the -- I -- and the guy who was smiling there, I guessed he must have been he, so I smiled back to him. And lo and behold, a day after or 04 148 so, somebody -- my boss, or my -- no, the waitress tells me that he wants to meet me after work. And I say, \u201cUh-uh, I\u2019m not meeting him.\u201d And that went on for a few days. In the meantime the rose was getting more beautiful in my room up there, because it was a red rose, and the room was white, so in front of a mirror was multiplied, 1t was a beautiful rose. Anyway, but I said no, and no, and no. And then my boss came in and said, \u201cHow come you say no? Why don\u2019t you go and meet him? He\u2019s a nice guy, he send you the rose. Go and meet him.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I -- I don\u2019t want to meet him. You can tell him, I don\u2019t want to meet him.\u201d And ended there, but I didn\u2019t want to meet him because I didn\u2019t want to get involved into attachments that may lead me where I don\u2019t want to go."

We slept on the floor, we didn\u2019t sleep in bed, but was comfortable enough. And then Marcel had to join his -- he had to be repatriated, so he had to go on his own, and we went -- we went -- we hitchhiked on 4 American trucks. There was nothing else that was going, so it had to be American trucks. And the Americans were very good, and we told them we want to go home, or something, I don\u2019t know what we told them. But the -- we didn\u2019t speak English at all, so we couldn\u2019t speak English, so they pu -- they took us in and we -- and then where w -- they got off, we wer -- they had to stop, we got off, and we went in another truck, and th - we ended up in a place where Marcel told us -- I -- I don\u2019t recall exactly, but I now are just surmising, we m-met with him in a place where was a security center for the -- and I don\u2019t know if it was on the French soil, or if it was on an American soil -- I -- not American soil, on the German soil, I don\u2019t remember that. It must have been on -- on the border, or something. Or -- at that time there were no borders, so it didn\u2019t really matter. Because th -- now the f -- Germany had no more borders. The former borders wouldn\u2019t count. So -- so we ended up in security place, and I had to go through security, and Franka had to go through security, and Marcel didn\u2019t have to. But Marcel concocted a story for me which now looking back it seemed so foolish and stupid that I can\u2019t even imagine. He decided I needed to tell them that I lived in France before the war, in my stupid little French, and -- and that I -- and my na -- and th -- and ga -- he gave me another name to sound more French. I -- I was a -- a French 1n a -- from -- of Polish origin, and I was deported to Germany for labor. Well, that opened a can of worms. It was a terrible thing to do. So I was introduced to this major, French major, and I explained to him what Marcel told me to do. And he went to a hell and fury. And he abused me using the language I could not even translate, so I don\u2019t -- not do it. And he 5 called me all kinds of terrible names. Allegedly, according to him, and I\u2019m not sure it was hundred percent true, maybe he just wanted to scare me. But he said that only volunteers, women volunteers went to Germany for forced labor, and if I were a women volunteer, then I -- and he called me whatever it is that he called me. A traitor and some other juicy things. And so I, being the little girl, I still was a little -- my mother\u2019s little girl, I started to cry. And I tried to re -- no, I [indecipherable] I am -- I am Jewish. Ah, well that was another can of worms, you are Jewish. Okay, let\u2019s see -- look through your things. And he tells me, and how come this sweater\u2019s new and still has the mark a -- 1-1-it -- it\u2019s not -- it has a mark of the factory on it? And how come -- you are a dirty Jew, you probably went and robbed the factory, you robbed and plundered. You sale juive. I -- I don\u2019t think it stopped my tears, right. An-And you know, the thing was that in order to have the sweater, in order to have whatever I had, my rucksack, I traded it, the dress that my aunt gave me, because I felt that I didn\u2019t have room for it. And I traded everything I had to have this nap -- knapsack and this sweater, and things that I could wear and put in the knapsack. So I felt that -- and there\u2019s one thing I could never stand and I still cannot stand is injustice. So I thought that was the most, the -- the biggest injustice that to -- to -- to be faced with this bloody major, and I felt I was back in France of -- what was the name of the guy who was innocently accused of betrayal? Well, I -- I know his name, but doesn\u2019t come to me."

So we stayed there, we were taken -- first we spend a -- a couple of days at the Hotel Lutetia, which was a hote -- a place where they gathered all the refugees coming out of the war zone, and they were giving them medical reviews, and then they was disposing wi-with them accordingly to their state of health. And since our health appeared -- appeared to them adequate, they referred us to the Jewish agencies. And the Jewish agencies, since we were young girls, they were -- we were treated as adolescents, and we report to something called pension en famille, but it wasn\u2019t really -- 1t was a converted synagogue, and we -- in [indecipherable] converted offices in we -- that was very -- it was very primitive because they were converted offices, and we spend there some time. And then they made plans for us, as far as our future was concerned. I was to -- to become a stenodactylo, meaning I had to -- I was -- since I didn\u2019t have a high school diploma and I couldn\u2019t have a high school diploma, I could not have the permission to study, so I had to learn a vocation, that vocation would have been -- that was the easiest thing, since I knew 0 a little French, so I would go to the French school, and then I would become a stenodactylo. And that was the plan. And Franka had to learn French first, and then decide what to do later. But in the meantime Franka came up with the idea that we -- she has to look for her family, she cannot start new life without finishing the old one, which was -- it kind of made sense. And it made sense to me too, except it was so hard to get to Paris, and to leave it, we would have to do some horrendous things. Because there were no trains, nothing. The only trains that went back to Poland were the Russian convoys, with the rush -- Russian nationals, because there was a secret agreement at Yalta between the heads of states, that all the western heads of states relinquish the rights to Russian nationals, and will turn them over to the -- to the Russian authorities. And that\u2019s what they were doing. And I witnessed them doing that in the movie theaters, where they would stand by the door, and watch for the patrons to leave, and they would round up whomever -- whoever they thought were a nash -- a Russian national, which wasn\u2019t too hard to detect. And the only way we could do that -- and then they would put them in a special camp that was organized in a place called Beauregard, near Paris, and once you entered this it was Russian territory, it was just like entering a ma -- a Russian embassy, and there you were in a Russian soil, that was it. So the only way to ma -- Franka had some Russian friends, so she found that out. She spoke Russian, her family was of Russian origin. And she spoke Russian very well, I -- I just had little Russian. And she decided that we can enter that camp, and -- and then they will transport us east. I don\u2019t know, we didn\u2019t have it -- the idea that we might go to Lw\u00e9w, but I -- I -- I don\u2019t think ba 1- well, anyway, by the time when we le -- we went to that camp, that was a very primitive camp, with barracks, and there were a lot of people, and they all under lock and key, of course. That was a locked up camp with, I think, guards all over the place. And I think we spend some time there, maybe week, maybe more, maybe less. And we left in July, I think, or maybe late June, I don\u2019t know. I can look at the dates in the papers. And - and we left on a transport, and it was -- 1-1t was not a regular train, it was a train tha -- for deportees, so it was not a -- it was freight train, in -- in other words. And I think we sl- slept on the gr -- on the -- on something made from straw kind of things, inside the train. And the train would stop very often because to let go other trains that had priority. And one such train was a prison train, with -- guarded by soldiers, with -- with bars in the little windows, and right away the rumors spread that this train was a prison train for the followers of General Vlasov, and General Vlasov was a -- a traitor to the war effort because he -- even though he was originally a very heroic general, he surrendered to Germans and he promised them to fight on their side, along -- and he recruited lot of former prisoners of war, maybe mostly Ukrainians. And they fought -- I don\u2019t if they fought it, maybe -- I don\u2019t know if Germans really trusted them to fight or not. But, a-at the end of the war, they were considered the biggest traitors ever, both to the Russians, and to Americans, because they were fighting on the side of Germany. But General Vlasov was thinking in terms of saving his skin, and so he pushed to be on the -- under the western side -- western sphere of influence. So, he surrendered, somewhere in Czechoslovakia, or maybe not in Czechoslovakia, I think near Czechoslovakia, to the 2 American forces, with his whole army. And he was taken prisoner, but he didn\u2019t know about that arrangement of yal -- at Yalta, and he was immediately turned over -- I don\u2019t know if -- how immediately, but very soon turned over to the Soviet authorities, and he was sent to Russia and shot. And I -- I don\u2019t know if he was tried or not, if he -- you know, I don\u2019t know. They -- they did show trials in Soviet Union. But the soldiers, the soldiers we saw there, and the soldiers were making jokes with us, who would -- you know, we surrounded, surrounded the train right away, and there were young faces in these barred windows, and they were smiling and laughing. A-And -- and we all knew they were going to their death. And I didn\u2019t know, you know, we knew they were going to their death, but what kind of death they met, I didn\u2019t know then, until now I saw it on the internet. And it -- there is a -- and there is a -- a report of somebody who witnessed, an engineer, American engineer in the army who witnessed their surrender, and he relates that they were shot immediately after they disembarked in -- on the -- out of the trains in Russia. They were sho -- 0-on -- on arrival. They were shot on arrival. A-And we met that -- we met them on the way. And we had to wait because their train had the priority."

            "answer": "So, I -- I-I -- I ha -- I -- I think we got off in Krakow, and we got the permit. As refugees they would give us a per -- we got -- we escaped from the train, it wasn\u2019t so easy, we -- we brood about it, and thought about it, and -- and we got off the train by subterfuge, telling we wanted water, or something, or food. And we never got back on, and our papers went with the train, the main papers that we had. And our name went -- yeah, they went to Russia. So -- but we had some other papers still left, so we used them. And I think we did anyway. I -- you know, I don\u2019t remember what I had or I didn\u2019t have, I certainly acquire a lot -- acquired -- upon arrival, we acquired a lot of papers. So -- and I know that if we went to Poland, we went under name of Franka and Helena, or Helene, because that -- otherwise would have been foolish. So -- so a-an -- so we got off at Krakow, we got a pass to Rzeszow, we got off in Rzeszow. When we got off -- I mean, we escaped from the train in Krakow, and we got a permit -- free train ride to Rzeszow, o-on the base that we were refugees looking for family, which was true. We got to Rzeszow, and we walked in the situation after a pogrom. And because there was a pogrom in there -- Rzesz\u00e9w couple days before, and we learned that, and the streets were kind of empty, we didn\u2019t know what to do, but we came across a person, we decided he must be Jewish. So we stopped him, a-and he turned -- it turned out right, and right away 4 he took us to the place, to a Jewish community, and they said people are in hiding now because we have the situation, and later on I found out that some people were even killed, but at that time he didn\u2019t tell us that. But I found out from other people who were there, and you know, and that\u2019s why I knew about the -- I mean, from another point of view. But in the meantime he -- he told us that -- well, 1-1f we want to get out, we should get out as soon as possible. I don\u2019t know if it was he who told us that the borders to Czechoslovakia, we have to get out from Czechoslova -- through Czechoslovakia, might be closed, and he send us to Krakow, back to Krak\u00e9w, and he gave us money, and he prepared our -- I-I don\u2019t know if we got a train pass, or we paid for the train, whatever it was. They ro -- and they received us just like we were their brothers, or their family; very, very well. And they put us on the train, and we ended up in Krakow, only this time to stay, not to leave. And the first thing we did, we went to the Jewish Community Center, and we started looking for people who registered there, because whoever came, registered there. And he told us that, he told us go to -- go to [indecipherable] to examine the registry of survivors. And lo and behold I found my girlfriend from Lwow. The girl, with whom I went to school, the high school, was my best friend in high school. So of course I located her, and I told her our situation, w -- she -- she told me her story. She had a tragic story too, convoluted tragic story. Her fa -- her brother went to -- volunteered to fight for -- in Warsaw ghetto -- not Warsaw ghetto, the Polish Warsaw uprising, and he -- he fought as a Pole, and he was taken prisoner and he died in somewhere, of his wounds. And so she was now alone, and -- and her parents got killed 5 in the round-ups of Lw\u00e9w, and she says she wants to go with us. So there were three of us now. So -- but she knew a lot of people in Krakow, so she arranged for passes to Czechoslovakia. The reason we went to Czechoslova -- we were going to Czechoslovakia is to -- to go to the French embassy. And the fren -- the closest was in Prague, so we went to Prague. So we -- so she secured the -- she helped us secure the passes, and that time was still passes and the wonder was, that was one of the last passes every issued at that time. Later on the borders were closed, there were no passes, and whoever wanted to get out had to do it illegally. So the people were crossing to Germany instead of Prague. And we went -- I think we went through Katowice, because I have a pass to Katowice. So he -- we went through Katowice to Prague. Of course Prague is the mo -- one of the most beautiful cities of Europe, and we were there for three days and I\u2019m s -- kind of speeding it up, so we did see some places and things. But when we went to the French embassy we presented our case, and -- and -- and without any ado, they granted the per -- as the [indecipherable]. We told them that we -- we were in France and we came back to look for the family, and we didn\u2019t find anybody. So since we didn\u2019t find any -- in Rzesz\u00e9w I didn\u2019t find anybody, my be -- my uncle wasn\u2019t there. And I checked with -- they had registry there too, the local registry and he wasn\u2019t there. And -- and so I went -- so we told him the truth, and he said yes of course, and he said com -- that there\u2019s a plane tomorrow that leaves for Paris. Be on it. And --"
