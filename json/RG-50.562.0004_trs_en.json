And they didn\u2019t all hang them on good ropes. They hang them on thin ropes, so the ropes will break, and the people would come down and be bloody and made to go again to be rehanged. And there was -- and last one of them was Dr. Landsberg, and he was the head of the Jewish Council. And there\u2019s a controversy about what he did or didn\u2019t do.

I -- they were supporting us maybe, in a way. I remember that the girlfriend of I-Irene\u2019s is there, but I don\u2019t remember her name, so that\u2019s why I can\u2019t refer to her by name. And -- and I think she\u2019s mad. She\u2019s mad because my mother doesn\u2019t let me go and -- and get food on the Aryan side, because I have Aryan looks, I mean non- Jewish looks, and why don\u2019t I go and a -- why don\u2019t I go and -- and do that?

So we stayed there, we were taken -- first we spend a -- a couple of days at the Hotel Lutetia, which was a hote -- a place where they gathered all the refugees coming out of the war zone, and they were giving them medical reviews, and then they was disposing wi-with them accordingly to their state of health. And since our health appeared -- appeared to them adequate, they referred us to the Jewish agencies. And the Jewish agencies, since we were young girls, they were -- we were treated as adolescents, and we report to something called pension en famille, but it wasn\u2019t really -- 1t was a converted synagogue, and we -- in [indecipherable] converted offices in we -- that was very -- it was very primitive because they were converted offices, and we spend there some time. And then they made plans for us, as far as our future was concerned. I was to -- to become a stenodactylo, meaning I had to -- I was -- since I didn\u2019t have a high school diploma and I couldn\u2019t have a high school diploma, I could not have the permission to study, so I had to learn a vocation, that vocation would have been -- that was the easiest thing, since I knew This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And that was the plan. And Franka had to learn French first, and then decide what to do later. But in the meantime Franka came up with the idea that we -- she has to look for her family, she cannot start new life without finishing the old one, which was -- it kind of made sense. And it made sense to me too, except it was so hard to get to Paris, and to leave it, we would have to do some horrendous things. Because there were no trains, nothing. The only trains that went back to Poland were the Russian convoys, with the rush -- Russian nationals, because there was a secret agreement at Yalta between the heads of states, that all the western heads of states relinquish the rights to Russian nationals, and will turn them over to the -- to the Russian authorities. And that\u2019s what they were doing. And I witnessed them doing that in the movie theaters, where they would stand by the door, and watch for the patrons to leave, and they would round up whomever -- whoever they thought were a nash -- a Russian national, which wasn\u2019t too hard to detect. And the only way we could do that -- and then they would put them in a special camp that was organized in a place called Beauregard, near Paris, and once you entered this it was Russian territory, it was just like entering a ma -- a Russian embassy, and there you were in a Russian soil, that was it. So the only way to ma -- Franka had some Russian friends, so she found that out. She spoke Russian, her family was of Russian origin. And she spoke Russian very well, I -- I just had little Russian. And she decided that we can enter that camp, and -- and then they will transport us east. I don\u2019t know, we didn\u2019t have it -- the idea that we might go to Lw\u00e9w, but I -- I -- I don\u2019t think ba  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

That was a locked up camp with, I think, guards all over the place. And I think we spend some time there, maybe week, maybe more, maybe less. And we left in July, I think, or maybe late June, I don\u2019t know. I can look at the dates in the papers. And - and we left on a transport, and it was -- 1-1t was not a regular train, it was a train tha -- for deportees, so it was not a -- it was freight train, in -- in other words. And I think we sl- slept on the gr -- on the -- on something made from straw kind of things, inside the train. And the train would stop very often because to let go other trains that had priority. And one such train was a prison train, with -- guarded by soldiers, with -- with bars in the little windows, and right away the rumors spread that this train was a prison train for the followers of General Vlasov, and General Vlasov was a -- a traitor to the war effort because he -- even though he was originally a very heroic general, he surrendered to Germans and he promised them to fight on their side, along -- and he recruited lot of former prisoners of war, maybe mostly Ukrainians. And they fought -- I don\u2019t if they fought it, maybe -- I don\u2019t know if Germans really trusted them to fight or not. But, a-at the end of the war, they were considered the biggest traitors ever, both to the Russians, and to Americans, because they were fighting on the side of Germany. But General Vlasov was thinking in terms of saving his skin, and so he pushed to be on the -- under the western side -- western sphere of influence. So, he surrendered, somewhere in Czechoslovakia, or maybe not in Czechoslovakia, I think near Czechoslovakia, to the  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And he was taken prisoner, but he didn\u2019t know about that arrangement of yal -- at Yalta, and he was immediately turned over -- I don\u2019t know if -- how immediately, but very soon turned over to the Soviet authorities, and he was sent to Russia and shot. And I -- I don\u2019t know if he was tried or not, if he -- you know, I don\u2019t know. They -- they did show trials in Soviet Union. But the soldiers, the soldiers we saw there, and the soldiers were making jokes with us, who would -- you know, we surrounded, surrounded the train right away, and there were young faces in these barred windows, and they were smiling and laughing. A-And -- and we all knew they were going to their death. And I didn\u2019t know, you know, we knew they were going to their death, but what kind of death they met, I didn\u2019t know then, until now I saw it on the internet. And it -- there is a -- and there is a -- a report of somebody who witnessed, an engineer, American engineer in the army who witnessed their surrender, and he relates that they were shot immediately after they disembarked in -- on the -- out of the trains in Russia. They were sho -- 0-on -- on arrival. They were shot on arrival. A-And we met that -- we met them on the way. And we had to wait because their train had the priority."

And the first thing we did, we went to the Jewish Community Center, and we started looking for people who registered there, because whoever came, registered there.

So we -- so she secured the -- she helped us secure the passes, and that time was still passes and the wonder was, that was one of the last passes every issued at that time. Later on the borders were closed, there were no passes, and whoever wanted to get out had to do it illegally. So the people were crossing to Germany instead of Prague. And we went -- I think we went through Katowice, because I have a pass to Katowice. So he -- we went through Katowice to Prague.
