            "question": "Okay, let\u2122s pause. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. This is an interview with Beno Helmer, conducted on March third, 2000, by Arwin Donohue. This is a follow up interview to a videotaped interview that was conducted with Mr. Helmer, and this interview will focus on his post-Holocaust experiences. The videotaped in terview focused on his Holocaust era experiences. We may go back and -- and discuss some of th e Holocaust era experiences that weren\u2122t mentioned in the first interview. This is tape number one, side A. And, Mr. Helmer, I thought we would start with the moment of your liberation, and -- and move forward from there, and we\u2122ll see how -- how it goes, as far as going back before that. And you described in your first interview how you were -- the circumstances of your liberation, and how the am -- U.S. army came into the -- to the POW camp where you were. And I wondered -- you mentioned something about th is moment of freedom, and I wondered if you would talk a little bit about what that -- what freedom meant to you.",
            "answer": "Let me regress a little bit. The day of -- when I was liberated, it wan -- matter of fact, I think to -- let\u2122s say 24 hours before I was lib er -- I was -- got the worst beating in my lifetime. [indecipherable] I st ill have scars on my head and my shoulders, because the commander told us to march with him wherever he wanted to march, and I refused him. So he had a big, huge stick, and he beat me mercilessly. And I gonna die, but I\u2122d rather USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064 4 die instead of marching with him. Some hour s later, down the road, we saw a tank with a big, white, five star -- s -- five star -- star emblem. W-We didn\u2122t kn ow what that\u2122s -- I didn\u2122t know what that\u2122s -- this means the American army, I know the five star emblem was the Russian army, so we thought that\u2122s the Russian army came. But it wasn\u2122t so, because hours later, one s-single soldier came in, a short, little fellow what had a -- a -- a -- a rucksack on his back, and he said he is an American. It was a little fellow from Brooklyn. And the first thing he said, \ufb01Where is there water?\ufb02 He was thirsty, so I said, \ufb01We have a water fo -- water pump, but you\u2122re not allowed to drink it,\ufb02 -- be -- matter of fact, the first time I went into the camp, the commander told us we are not allowed to drink from this water, because this may give typhoid. And he said if anybody\u2122s drinking from this fountain, he going to be shot. And he said, \ufb01To pr ove to you,\ufb02 he took out his pistol, took an innocent man, and shot him. A Russia-Russian worker. This camp consisted of building prisoner of war camps for the American flyers, which was never finished, and that\u2122s the reason we slept on sand. So now, let\u2122s go right -- back to the American soldier. He said he was thirsty. So we said to him, \ufb01You cannot drink from this fountain, because you\u2122re going to die.\ufb02 He says, \ufb01No problem.\ufb02 Took the water, put it in his canteen, and put a pill into his water, shook it, and he drank it, and I think this was the biggest miracle I ever saw in my lifetime at that time, that he survived, he didn\u2122t die from his -- because of this little pill. A few hours later he says he going to bring some food, give it to it -- va -- ba -- bring us food because we were starving. I mean, when I was USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064 5 liberated, after aid already, I was weighing 92 or 94 pounds. So in that evening, or next day, the French came with a kitchen, a truck which had a big kettle of soup, in -- in the back, and the French men, they -- they said, \ufb01That\u2122s the fr -- thanks to the French liberation,\ufb02 which wasn\u2122t so, \ufb01we going to sing \u201aThe Marseilles.\u2122\ufb02 And I had a friend of mine which name is ra -- Ravel Monya -- Monyek Ravel. And I said, \ufb01I will not sing the French national anthem, because they did not liberate us.\ufb02 So I said, \ufb01Ravel, since we are free, let\u2122s get out of here.\ufb02 He says, \ufb01No, I don\u2122t want to go.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Ravel, good-bye, I am leaving.\ufb02 He followed me. And this how I left the camp, but it -- the biggest miracle I saw that time was the canteen with the pill in the water."

            "question": "I should just say that in your first interview, you did talk about that period, and you talked about your liberation, so I asked the question just to find out a little bit more about what was going on inside of you at that time, as far as what you -- you said, you know, this was a moment of realizing that you were free, and -- and what -- and whether that meant -- did you have any sense of allegiance to any country, or any people, or -- or what -- what were your thoughts inside, at that point?",
            "answer": "No, thi -- at that point, I felt I was an orphaned. This the first time I felt I was an orphan, because it was bewildering being free. What does that mean being free? Do I go wherever I want to go? Or do I go where th ey going to tell me to go? And in -- I -- I didn\u2122t have anything, no clothing, I had no fo od. I left the French camp, and I -- I start missing people. I missed my parents, I misse d my sister. My sist er, I thought she was USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064 6 perished anyways. She was a very, very skinny, little girl, so I said she cannot survive the camp. But I had a brother of mine, which was six years younger than I was, I said, \ufb01He was a strong lad, maybe he survived.\ufb02 But unfortunately, the fate wa -- dealt us a different card. The only one who survived was my sister, nob ody else. So when I walked out, I wanted to go back to Prague, to Czechoslovakia. An d -- and we marched, Monyek and I, we marched, and I\u2122m sure I told it before, this -- I was -- first time I was encountered with baseball. I spoke about the ba seball, so it\u2122s -- I don\u2122t have to spay about that any more."

I wrote it to the Jewish HIAS, or it was some organization in Sweden, to get in touch with Monyek Ravel, but it never, never got -- never I got an answer, never heard from him since. That\u2122s correct, I completely forgot. He want to go to Paris, and I want to go back home. And I\u2122m sure I told you I finally wound up in a DP camp. The American took me to DP camp in -- I told him I was Polish, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064 7 and I decided it\u2122s going to Poland, it\u2122s closer to go to Poland, from Poland to -- to Teplice, to Czechoslovakia, than -- than staying where I was. So you know the story about the rape of the women in the -- in the -- in the -- in the garage, and I don\u2122t know if you know this, when I came home, finally came back to Prague, I got sick.

And they put me the hospital to -- hospital name of Boulav cabbage, I spent some tim e there, and I was in the wo -- in the room with some Russian soldiers, and they were feeding me vodka. So the medication did not help too much, because whatever medication they gave me, the vodka counteracted it. So finally the doctor said, \ufb01You know, by now you should be having the results.\ufb02 So finally he USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064 8 found out, he saw a glass of vodka there, so he put me another room, and -- and finally I got better.

With all the killing what\u2122s going on by people with guns, we can\u2122t even pass a gun control law. I mean, it\u2122s -- it\u2122s terrible. So sometime I feel a small, autocratic nation, a small autocratic philosophy, is not the worst thing in the whole world. Democracy is terrific, what it stands for now, to -- quoting Mr. Churchill, he said, \ufb01Democracy is only good right now, because we don\u2122t know of anything better.\ufb02 But if you take Helle nistic culture, the destroying of Hellenistic culture was democracy, because everybody was right.

You\u2122re allowed to bear arms for the militia. We have a militia, it\u2122s called the National Guard. You know the militia thas I going to shoot at him, he\u2122s coming through my door today, and I\u2122m allowed to have a gun. We have to be educated. There\u2122s nobody more armed in the whole world than it is in Israel. Almost everybody had a rifle every -- but the killing is not there. So it seems like we have to educate not only what the gun stands for, but what the gun can do. But here we just -- yo -- the last two days we got a six year old child -- killed a six year old boy. A six year old boy killed some s-six year old child. This fellow killed yesterday, because he doesn\u2122t like the white people, killed three people. And we can\u2122t pass a gun control law. We can\u2122t even USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064 55 pass a law to put a -- a governor on a gun. So this reason -- we have to be involved.

It gave me a certain satisfac tion, but in retrospect, I just made a speech for some newspaper editors, and newspaper artists , and I said to them -- was last year, or two years ago. And I said to them, \ufb01You know something? Sometimes I slee -- during the night I get up, and I says, you know, you killed somebody\u2122s child.\ufb02 And then one of the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064 61 fellows said, \ufb01You know, I felt the same wa y.\ufb02 I don\u2122t know if it\u2122s compassio -- what about a chi -- ki [indecipherable] was -- I kill ed somebody\u2122s child. Now let me tell you an incident what happened to me two years ago. I go around -- I used to go around -- used to go around, make speeches about the Holocaust, and it\u2122s either the -- the -- how it\u2122s Hitler came to power, the German push on Munich, push. Landsbe rg, and -- and vay -- Hitler with \ufb01Mein Kampf,\ufb02 and ha -- Rudolf Hess, everything else. So before -- this was in Lakewood Community College in Lakewood, whic h is part of the Fl-Florida University.

I picked one of them who looks -- who looks Jewish, something like this. She looks Jewish. No problem is she going to know what the Holocaust means. I says, \ufb01Yes, young lady, what is the Holocaust?\ufb02 She says, \ufb01E thnic food.\ufb02 You\u2122re making a face? That\u2122s what she said. End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B ",
                " So she said it\u2122s ethnic food, and it\u2122s extrem ely disappointed since then. I feel when we take the children to the Holocaust museum, and I -- and I think it\u2122s -- since you are working there, I wonder if you ever observed, when they walk out, they make, tch, tch, tch, tch. It\u2122s leaves an effect, and after is always feels better, we going to eat now. I mean, I don\u2122t know how long emotion stays with them. They should made a study, how long USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064 62 emotion stays with you, if it doesn\u2122t touche s you extremely personally, you know, father, mother, cousin, something. When you see a strange mass of people, eight million, s-six million, 25 million. It\u2122s only a number. History teaches us it\u2122s not the first Holocaust we went through, not in this scope, but we know tha -- wer -- were that -- to sin -- crusifi -- to Crusades, because French Huguenots, there\u2122s a Christian killing Christians, almost everybody. The Turks went all the way up to Vienna, they killed mercilessly. We went down to the -- two Crusades, we killed everybody who came in our way. So you see, so -- so this Holocaust is repeated itself, only in bigger scope. And I always wonder, is if you talk about it, it\u2122s only eventually going to be a sentence in a new -- in the history books. You know, there was a Holocaust, 35 million people died, 25 million people died, six million Jews is gonna die, and that\u2122s all what it is. I\u2122m a very much involved now with the Holocaust survivors here, right here where I live, but you know, now, as a matter of fact, just recently went to a meeting, and somebody said something about the Holocau -- he says, \ufb01Oh, we here to have good times.\ufb02 See, even the Holocaus t survivors don\u2122t want to dwell of what happened. He says, \ufb01We ve -- have a life, now let\u2122s have -- let\u2122s think of good times.\ufb02 So I don\u2122t know where to we -- history going to tea -- what history going to think of us. Maybe the museum going to stay for some time, like same thing Museum of National History, says, you kn ow we -- how the Indians lived, and how the Neanderthal man lived, and how the Elsie lived, and the -- maybe we going to be just a little [indecipherable]. I went to Prague, there\u2122s a gorgeous, gorgeous synagogue, which called USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0064 63 the Portuguese synagogue, which is gorgeous. Hitler left it inta ct, because he said, \ufb01After all the Jews are destroyed, this going to be a show, the museum how the Jew -- there was a race, by the name of Jews.\ufb02 And he left it. And that\u2122s all. And we were eventually going to be the Holocaust, I feel going to be, you know, there was a -- a Holocaust, there was a -- a -- a darkness over Europe, which -- caused by one man, and his organization.
