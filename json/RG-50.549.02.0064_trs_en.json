            "question": "Okay, let\u2019s pause. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. This is an interview with Beno Helmer, conducted on March third, 2000, by Arwin Donohue. This is a follow up interview to a videotaped interview that was conducted with Mr. Helmer, and this interview will focus on his post-Holocaust experiences. The videotaped interview focused on his Holocaust era experiences. We may go back and -- and discuss some of the Holocaust era experiences that weren\u2019t mentioned in the first interview. This is tape number one, side A. And, Mr. Helmer, I thought we would start with the moment of your liberation, and -- and move forward from there, and we\u2019ll see how -- how it goes, as far as going back before that. And you described in your first interview how you were -- the circumstances of your liberation, and how the am -- U.S. army came into the -- to the POW camp where you were. And I wondered -- you mentioned something about this moment of freedom, and I wondered if you would talk a little bit about what that -- what freedom meant to you.",
            "answer": "Let me regress a little bit. The day of -- when I was liberated, it wan -- matter of fact, I think to -- let\u2019s say 24 hours before I was liber -- I was -- got the worst beating in my lifetime. [indecipherable] I still have scars on my head and my shoulders, because the commander told us to march with him wherever he wanted to march, and I refused him. So he had a big, huge stick, and he beat me mercilessly. And I gonna die, but I\u2019d rather die instead of marching with him. Some hours later, down the road, we saw a tank with a big, white, five star -- s -- five star -- star emblem. W-We didn\u2019t know what that\u2019s -- I didn\u2019t know what that\u2019s -- this means the American army, I know the five star emblem was the Russian army, so we thought that\u2019s the Russian army came. But it wasn\u2019t so, because hours later, one s-single soldier came in, a short, little fellow what had a -- a -- a- a rucksack on his back, and he said he is an American. It was a little fellow from Brooklyn. And the first thing he said, \u201c\u201cWhere is there water?\u201d He was thirsty, so I said, \u201cWe have a water fo -- water pump, but you\u2019re not allowed to drink it,\u201d -- be -- matter of fact, the first time I went into the camp, the commander told us we are not allowed to drink from this water, because this may give typhoid. And he said 1f anybody\u2019s drinking from this fountain, he going to be shot. And he said, \u201cTo prove to you,\u201d he took out his pistol, took an innocent man, and shot him. A Russia-Russian worker. This camp consisted of building prisoner of war camps for the American flyers, which was never finished, and that\u2019s the reason we slept on sand. So now, let\u2019s go right -- back to the American soldier. He said he was thirsty. So we said to him, \u201cYou cannot drink from this fountain, because you\u2019re going to die.\u201d He says, \u201cNo problem.\u201d Took the water, put it in his canteen, and put a pill into his water, shook it, and he drank it, and I think this was the biggest miracle I ever saw in my lifetime at that time, that he survived, he didn\u2019t die from his -- because of this little pill. A few hours later he says he going to bring some food, give it to it -- va -- ba -- bring us food because we were starving. I mean, when I was liberated, after aid already, I was weighing 92 or 94 pounds. So in that evening, or next day, the French came with a kitchen, a truck which had a big kettle of soup, in -- in the back, and the French men, they -- they said, \u201cThat\u2019s the fr -- thanks to the French liberation,\u201d which wasn\u2019t so, \u201cwe going to sing \u201cThe Marseilles.\u2019\u201d And I had a friend of mine which name Is ra -- Ravel Monya -- Monyek Ravel. And I said, \u201cI will not sing the French national anthem, because they did not liberate us.\u201d So I said, \u201cRavel, since we are free, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d He says, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to go.\u201d I said, \u201cRavel, good-bye, I am leaving.\u201d He followed me. And this how I left the camp, but it -- the biggest miracle I saw that time was the canteen with the pill in the water."

            "question": "I should just say that in your first interview, you did talk about that period, and you talked about your liberation, so I asked the question just to find out a little bit more about what was going on inside of you at that time, as far as what you -- you said, you know, this was a moment of realizing that you were free, and -- and what -- and whether that meant -- did you have any sense of allegiance to any country, or any people, or -- or what- what were your thoughts inside, at that point?",
            "answer": "No, thi -- at that point, I felt I was an orphaned. This the first time I felt I was an orphan, because it was bewildering being free. What does that mean being free? Do I go wherever I want to go? Or do I go where they going to tell me to go? And in -- [ -- I didn\u2019t have anything, no clothing, I had no food. I left the French camp, and I -- I start missing people. I missed my parents, I missed my sister. My sister, I thought she was perished anyways. She was a very, very skinny, little girl, so I said she cannot survive the camp. But I had a brother of mine, which was six years younger than I was, I said, \u201cHe was a strong lad, maybe he survived.\u201d But unfortunately, the fate wa -- dealt us a different card. The only one who survived was my sister, nobody else. So when I walked out, I wanted to go back to Prague, to Czechoslovakia. And -- and we marched, Monyek and I, we marched, and I\u2019m sure I told it before, this -- I was -- first time I was encountered with baseball. I spoke about the baseball, so it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t have to spay about that any more."

I wrote it to the Jewish HIAS, or it was some organization in Sweden, to get in touch with Monyek Ravel, but it never, never got- never I got an answer, never heard from him since. That\u2019s correct, I completely forgot. He want to go to Paris, and I want to go back home. And I\u2019m sure I told you I finally wound up in a DP camp. The American took me to DP camp in -- I told him I was Polish, and I decided it\u2019s going to Poland, it\u2019s closer to go to Poland, from Poland to -- to Teplice, to Czechoslovakia, than -- than staying where I was.

Spoke to a lot of people, none of them knew where -- where I -- what [indecipherable] Mozartplatz, because it was a huge, gorgeous statue of Mozart, and the city all was be-behind it. I said, \u201c\u201cWas -- where\u2019s the Mozartplatz?\u201d First thing, very few of them spoke Czech. It\u2019s amazing that\u2019s very few of them speak Czech. And most mas -- not all -- most -- all of them, nobody -- nobody knew where Mozartplatz was, there -- this was there 50 years ago. So went to the city hall, and all of them are young people, they said, \u201cWe have no archives of it.\u201d No archives. I came the wrong day anyways. So, by coincidence, when I went to -- my mother was in charge of the theater, the opera and the theater, cult -- cultural center. So we went -- at least I went to see where my mother stayed the cultural center, and all of a sudden I see Mozart statue, oh it\u2019s very interesting. We-Went to see that the spot where Moz -- where Beethov -- I don\u2019t know if I said it, Beethoven, and -- and Gerta walked. Gerta and Beethoven used to come that summer. And Gerta says to Beethoven, \u201cMove aside, the Kaiser is behind you.\u201d And he said, ger -- ber -- Beethoven said to Gerta, he says, \u201cRemember one thing, in hundred years, nobody knows who the Kaiser was.\u201d And this is -- it\u2019s all written up, all over. And- so I went to this place, and matter of fact, as a child I remember my father took a picture of my sister and I, before my brother was born, right on the same spot where Mozart -- which I happen to have the picture, my aunt gave it to me."

Usually you don\u2019t have a time to do those things. B- But so the -- when I got the job in the summertime, playing in the movie, supplemented my income quite well. And in Budapest I was quite a -- quite a bright man, because we had to do an essay, in the college we had to do an essay about -- I forgot what it was. And I and another fellow won the essay. And for my college, or all the colleges in matter of fact, the compensation was this we allowed to -- we had a interview with the prelate of Hungary -- of my -- my so-called friend of mine, I went by ra-ra-railroad to a city by the name of Estergum. Did I ever mention this story? I went to the city of Estergum, and we have int -- audience with the archbishop of Hungary, in the city of Estergum. So it wasn\u2019t only for my college, there was a lot of the college -- enormous, big, big hall, gorgeous. And we staying in -- and we staying in a -- ina-- ina--ina semi-circle, and the -- the archbishop comes out with a entourage of four or five people, and he go -- starts to face to the left, and he goes around, he goes around, everybody kisses his ring. And I said, \u201cI will not kiss this man\u2019s ring.\u201d So finally he comes to me -- in th -- in -- in Hung-Hungary, you say, \u201cKasi chuclum,\u201d as a salutation. What this means, I kiss your hand. So I said, \u201cKasi chuclum,\u201d I shake his hand, no problem. Walks around, fine, a -- finishes, goes to the door, this one good looking, tall fellow, turns around, and to the t -- says something, and t-to the archbishop, see, and he turn -- the archbishop turns around, and the other fellow turns around, he looks at me, and does f -- points me. I said, \u201cI know, I\u2019m going to the execution. They going to kill me.\u201d I mean, why should he point to me? The -- the archbishop, and two more, three more men walk in, the tall, tall fellow. Those -- this -- me -- w-wave to me, and I should come to him. I said, \u201cDefinitely this is it, firing squad.\u201d Walk into the room, walk to his office, huge o -- marble, with a wonderful design on the floor. Takes me around the shoulder, and he says to me, \u201cI hear you\u2019re from a different per-persuasion.\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d He says, \u201cWhat are you?\u201d \u201cA-A-A Jew.\u201d So that\u2019s fine, says, talks to me -- matter of fact, everybody got sandwiches, or some kind of -- like a box lunch, it was something that I ate with him. I ate with him. And during the conversation, he says to me, \u201cWould you like to see where I going to be buried?\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s very unusual to ask somebody [indecipherable] to be buried.\u201d He says, \u201cSure.\u201d He takes me down, he takes me down to the catacombs. So when you walk down to the basement, or so-called catacombs, th-there\u2019s a -- a double staircase -- one -- both sides, there\u2019s a staircase going down. So on each one on the end, there\u2019s a statue. So he says to me, \u201cI bet you you don\u2019t know what those statues mean.\u201d I didn\u2019t know a Jew is allowed to bet. But it was very easy. One statue was a black statue, had a f -- a torch facing up, and the other side the statues had a f -- torch facing down. I said, \u201cThis 1s life, and this is death.\u201d So he very s -- was very impressed with it. And I walked down, he showed me the niche where he\u2019s going to be buried, and we walked back up. And was for quite a pleasant thing, and a matter of fact, I was extremely flattered, oh, I was so flattered. The fellow who I came on the railroad, wasn\u2019t too flattered with me. Matter of fact, he never spoke to me since. Not ev -- since, now I don\u2019t know where he is, but h-he wasn\u2019t Jewish, he never spoke to me, he was so jeal --"

So I had an aunt of mine, which I went to stay with my aunt for a little while, except they was almost as poor as I was. So, I had to find a job. [ -- I -- since I sub -- mentioned before, I played in the movies, I got a contact to Eddie Cantor. And Eddie Cantor was in contract at that time to RKO, and they offered me a job, a job o -- to be an usher in Radio City Music Hall, or become a waiter in -- up in the Catskills, some hotel in the Catskills. I didn\u2019t want to do any of those two. I didn\u2019t want to be a server, be an usher showing seats, or being a server in a hotel, so I declined all those offers. So I got myself a job -- actually, my cousin got me a job in S. Klein, there was a department store, an S. Klein, I got a job for 28 dollars a week, 60 hours a day. Six days, 10 hours a day. After tax and everything else, I came home with 24 dollars. Out of the 24 dollars, I had to give 15 dollars to my aunt for room and board. Actually, it was only room, and a Sunday dinner. Everything else had to be my own, so with the subway, which I think at that time was a nickel or dime, I didn\u2019t have too much money. So I lived on one sandwich a day, and I lived on salami sandwiches for months. Simple reason is, I didn\u2019t speak English -- I hardly spoke English, and I go into the cafeteria, I saw ona board, salami. So I said salami in [indecipherable] language must be salami. So I walk down the line and I said to the fellow, the server that was serving, \u201cSalami.\u201d He says something to me, I didn\u2019t understand it, but he had a long knife, and he pointed to a rye bread, so I wave my head, and so he made me a salami sandwich, and when you got the register, there were kind of small containers of milk, so I took two containers of milk. After one week, or two weeks, he knew already. So I went to the -- came to the end of my line, my salami sandwich was waiting on -- for me.

So it seems like we have to educate not only what the gun stands for, but what the gun can do. But here we just -- yo- the last two days we got a six year old child -- killed a six year old boy. A six year old boy killed some s-six year old child. This fellow killed yesterday, because he doesn\u2019t like the white people, killed three people. And we can\u2019t pass a gun control law. We can\u2019t even pass a law to put a -- a governor on a gun. So this reason -- we have to be involved. Being gun control, being equal right, being pregnancy, being whatever it is. I mean, where does it -- where does it -- my philosophy, where does the Senate, the House, or the -- the -- the state has a right to go into my wife\u2019s bedroom? Or anybody\u2019s bedroom? What you want to do with your body? I going to tell you you can\u2019t have an abortion -- you cannot have abortion. The people who have money, they going to get abortion regardless. If they don\u2019t get it here, they get it in Canada, they get it in Timbuktu, they get it someplace. Only that -- poor people have to get an abortion through a hanger. So you have to be involved politically."

You were under cert -- the regiment, or -- or the supervision. You c-could not exercise your freedom any way you wanted it. Army did the same thing to me.

But it was on the regiment, and I am a little rough to be regimented again, and that\u2019s was the difference.

He says 27. I don\u2019t say nothing, I didn\u2019t get there yet.

So, actually, I -- less I followed -- I f-found I came here for a new life. I mean, the past doesn\u2019t going to do nothing for me. Matter of fact, people are getting money from Germany. I didn\u2019t get -- I didn\u2019t have anything to do with them. I didn\u2019t get any money for 50 years. I just started receiving it the last one year. My sister\u2019s getting it for 50 years, I never, ever few -- I did nothing to do with it. I just didn\u2019t want to live through my past. Matter of fact, I was more interested in the ass-assassination of President Kennedy. And I read the Warren Report, and I was more interested things which happen now, which I am so -- here, where I have something to do about it, where I have something to say about it. In-In-In-In-In the German war, I was a pawn, I was just a pawn, and I\u2019m glad what I did, that sabotage work, which I did, blowing up trains. It gave me a certain satisfaction, but in retrospect, I just made a speech for some newspaper editors, and newspaper artists, and I said to them -- was last year, or two years ago. And I said to them, \u201cYou know something? Sometimes I slee -- during the night I get up, and I says, you know, you killed somebody\u2019s child.\u201d And then one of the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection fellows said, \u201cYou know, I felt the same way.\u201d I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s compassio -- what about a chi -- ki [indecipherable] was -- I killed somebody\u2019s child. Now let me tell you an incident what happened to me two years ago. I go around -- I used to go around -- used to go around, make speeches about the Holocaust, and it\u2019s either the -- the -- how it\u2019s Hitler came to power, the German push on Munich, push. Landsberg, and -- and vay -- Hitler with \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d and ha -- Rudolf Hess, everything else. So before -- this was in Lakewood Community College in Lakewood, which is part of the Fl-Florida University. So before I start the speech, I usually say, \u201cDoes anybody know what the Holocaust means?\u201d There are three girls -- three girls, one black, and two white girls raise their hand. I picked one of them who looks -- who looks Jewish, something like this. She looks Jewish. No problem is she going to know what the Holocaust means. I says, \u201cYes, young lady, what is the Holocaust?\u201d She says, \u201cEthnic food.\u201d You\u2019re making a face? That\u2019s what she said. End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B ",
                " So she said it\u2019s ethnic food, and it\u2019s extremely disappointed since then. I feel when we take the children to the Holocaust museum, and I -- and I think it\u2019s -- since you are working there, I wonder if you ever observed, when they walk out, they make, tch, tch, tch, tch. It\u2019s leaves an effect, and after is always feels better, we going to eat now. I mean, I don\u2019t know how long emotion stays with them. They should made a study, how long emotion stays with you, if it doesn\u2019t touches you extremely personally, you know, father, mother, cousin, something. When you see a strange mass of people, eight million, s-six million, 25 million. It\u2019s only a number. History teaches us it\u2019s not the first Holocaust we went through, not in this scope, but we know tha -- wer -- were that -- to sin -- crusifi -- to Crusades, because French Huguenots, there\u2019s a Christian killing Christians, almost everybody. The Turks went all the way up to Vienna, they killed mercilessly. We went down to the -- two Crusades, we killed everybody who came in our way. So you see, so -- so this Holocaust is repeated itself, only in bigger scope. And I always wonder, is if you talk about it, it\u2019s only eventually going to be a sentence in a new -- in the history books. You know, there was a Holocaust, 35 million people died, 25 million people died, six million Jews is gonna die, and that\u2019s all what it is. \u2019m a very much involved now with the Holocaust survivors here, right here where I live, but you know, now, as a matter of fact, just recently went to a meeting, and somebody said something about the Holocau -- he says, \u201cOh, we here to have good times.\u201d See, even the Holocaust survivors don\u2019t want to dwell of what happened. He says, \u201cWe ve -- have a life, now let\u2019s have -- let\u2019s think of good times.\u201d So I don\u2019t know where to we -- history going to tea -- what history going to think of us. Maybe the museum going to stay for some time, like same thing Museum of National History, says, you know we -- how the Indians lived, and how the Neanderthal man lived, and how the Elsie lived, and the -- maybe we going to be just a little [indecipherable]. I went to Prague, there\u2019s a gorgeous, gorgeous synagogue, which called the Portuguese synagogue, which is gorgeous. Hitler left it intact, because he said, \u201cAfter all the Jews are destroyed, this going to be a show, the museum how the Jew -- there was a race, by the name of Jews.\u201d And he left it. And that\u2019s all. And we were eventually going to be the Holocaust, I feel going to be, you know, there was a -- a Holocaust, there was a- a-- a darkness over Europe, which -- caused by one man, and his organization. It\u2019s sad. "

So after one time, after second time, he came, no. Third time he gave them some kind of pill where the -- the urine turns blue. He says, \u201cOh, it\u2019s helping.\u201d After few treatments, the warts went away. So he was my assistant, that wasn\u2019t much older than I was. And, as I said -- so this why -- I went to look, I had a girlfriend that time, and I was looking for anybody. I knew it wasn\u2019t my brother, because he was a man. So I was looking for my sister.
