            "answer": "Yeah, very happy life. And I grew up like that, not very interested in politics. I -- I was sheltered. My parents sheltered me from everything. I was not alone with my husband till the day we\u2019re married, that\u2019s how sheltered I was. I wanted to bring that up. We were never left alone. And that\u2019s how they kept me from many things. So when the time came for all the unrest, and so forth, I belonged to a gym class, and I was never allowed alone, and I was 15. And I always had somebody walk with me, and I was walking to a -- my gym class through the city of Vienna when it was two days before the vote of the anschluss. And we -- as I walked through the city of Vienna, everybody was shouting and yelling for their party. They were the Social Democrats, who had the three arrows. There were the Christian Socialists, they were black, white and red. There were even Communists with hammer and sickle. And everybody was shouting for their party. There wasn\u2019t one swastika in sight. I took my gym class, and when I came out, the entire city was a sea of swastikas. Every policeman, every building. There were synagogues burning already. There were books being thrown out of libraries, that had Jewish writers. It was something that 1t was burn into my mind that I can never forget, and whenever I hear that the -- the Viennese didn\u2019t want to be part of Germany, I can\u2019t believe that, because I was there. And I hope everybody knows that, because they wanted it, and they asked for it. And I knew very little about anything at the time, but I went home, and my father came home, and he said, \u201cLet\u2019s leave.\u201d\u201d And my mother said, \u201cWhat do you mean leave?\u201d He says, \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d We always had our passports ready cause we liked to travel. And my mother says, \u201cHow can we leave everything we have here, and we have nothing anywhere else, and where would we go?\u201d And my father said, \u201cI don\u2019t care where we go, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d And my mother wouldn\u2019t do it. And I -- I just couldn\u2019t imagine what was happening at that time, and I learned very fast. And it was an unbelievable moment in my life."

            "answer": "My parents were in the tailored supply business. Everything in Austria was tailor made, every suit, and every dress, and every hat, and every underwear. And my parents had all the supplies for tailors. And that was our business. My father was originally from Krakow, Poland, and he came from a family of -- he had three brothers and a sister. His father died when he was young, and the mother was a real -- they call it a queen. She was a real go-getter, and she worked her boys real hard, and they were very successful. And as a matter of fact, I used to go visit them, and then my father would go to the grave with his father, which was in the little town of Merkow, Poland. And we went there every year, and in -- in Merkow is where my father had grown up. And we went to visit where he used to live, and I had to stoop down, and be on a dirt floor, that\u2019s where he was born. And they did very well, and moved to Krakow. And they were in the dried fruit business, and my father was at the railroad station checking out carloads of fruits going to Vienna when they came and said they were looking for him to go into the military. So he got on that train with the fruit, and went to Vienna. And there he met my mother, and stayed. So, that\u2019s how I came about. His whole other [indecipherable] his family stayed in Krakow, and as a matter of fact, they all ended up on Schindler\u2019s list, eventually. But my father became very Viennese, and loved cars, and my mother was a very wonderful business woman. She\u2019d rather be in business than at home. And they always had somebody to keep me, either English miss to teach me English, or a French mademoiselle that teach me French. So I knew a little bit of both languages."

And the men and women did not sit together, but because I was a young girl, I was allowed to sit with my father every now and then, and I did. But we only went for holidays, and I was confirmed. And -- but we weren\u2019t very religious. My mother did not grow up very Orthodox. Her mother was Orthodox, but her father grew up in an orphanage, and therefore wasn\u2019t, and he loved to eat things that weren\u2019t kosher, and -- to the great concern of my grandmother, who was. And there was an interesting thing, my grandfather on my mother\u2019s side, his father loved symphonies, and music, and so forth, and he was in -- attending a concert when fire broke out, and all the -- the doors went in instead of out. And many people died from the smoke inhalation, hundreds. And when they told his mother that the father had perished, she died. And she left two little children who grew up in an orphanage. And he was still Jewish, but had not been brought up with a lot of it. And that\u2019s it. I was a mixture. My father was -- came from Orthodox home, but my mother didn\u2019t. And we never had any pork or seafood, or anything like that, but we weren\u2019t kosher."

I wasn\u2019t allowed to go with friends, I went with my parents.

            "question": "This must have been very shocking to you.",
            "answer": "It was a complete shock to me. It was a life changing hour, and a growing up hour, and also of taking things in hand. My mother was an extremely nervous person, very hysterical for everything, so I became the leader with my mother, because I was more calm. And so I aged very quickly. At that time, that day when everything went awry, my father started to say we\u2019ve got to leave here. But then, things happened so fast. The very first week of Hitler\u2019s coming into Austria, somebody came with a rifle, knocked on our door, and said, \u201cCar keys.\u201d That wa -- that\u2019s all that -- that was the whole interchange, and we handed over the car keys. And then somebody came and said, \u201cI like this apartment.\u201d My parents had bought it before they were married, and had put in a bathroom, and -- a co -- like a co-op, they had done all the alterations and everything, it was ours. And we had to be out 1n six hours or die. And what do you do first? Do you pack, do you find a place, do you moo -- what do you do? So one of my parents went and got boxes, and one went to find a place to live, and I started packing. And in six hours we were out with as much as we could pack. The rest we had to leave just like it was. You know, we had all kinds of built ins, and things, and was all gone. And the -- we moved to a place that was almost like a ghetto, because it was an very old house, and most of the people there had to move out quickly, had to move into places like that, so that was quite a shock. We had two stores, and you were no longer allowed to have employees that were not Jewish, and we always had help in the house, living in, and she had to leave, and the people in the store could no longer help us. So -- but they were still open, and we were trying to sell enough to have enough money to -- for every day things, because the bank accounts were closed, and all in all, this was our income. So we lived like that until Kristallnacht -- Crystal Night. Kristallnacht, we woke up in the morning, and my father had said -- we didn\u2019t know it was happening, and my father said, \u201cThings are getting so bad.\u201d This was already November. He said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I take some of our valuables to the store and hide them there?\u201d And he took out cameras, and some jewelry, and -- and he left. And as he left the phone rang, and my girlfriend called and said, \u201cDon\u2019t let your father leave,\u201d and hung up. We had no idea what was happening. You know, what people don\u2019t realize is there was no television, and there was -- there was very little communication, so that nobody knew it was happening, really. So about two minutes later, doorbell rang, and it was my father, and he said, \u201cI\u2019m lost. I\u2019ll never see you again, they arrested me, and they\u2019re taking me away.\u201d And I knew one of the men, and I ask him could I leave some keys with you? So he had all this camera, and jewelry and all on him, and he took that and put it somewhere. And then he put on long underwear because he was cold, and my mother was almost screaming. And then she had an idea, and she went next door to the neighbor, it was a Jewish woman with a son who was not well. He was Si -- a very sickly man at the time. And she said to her, \u201cWould you hide my husband?\u201d And she said yes, and she put my father in her closet. They came and took her son away, and she didn\u2019t tell them that my father was hiding there. Luckily at that time, there was no concentration camps yet, so they send him home because they -- they didn\u2019t know what to do with him. So we felt better that we -- you know, that my father survived, and he did, too. But this is how it was done. It was -- it -- it snuck up on us. It -- it -- we couldn\u2019t believe people would do things like that. So then we didn\u2019t know what to do about my father, then we found out from the radio that the Viennese had 24 hours to do with the Jews as they pleased. And they were taking away Jews from everywhere. Men. They -- they put men into prisons and things, but they had no room for the women yet, that came later. But I went downstairs and got a taxicab, and my father laid down on the floor of the cab, and the cab driver did not give us away. And we went to the store -- one of our stores, and we have a friend, a mutual friend of my husband and mine, who was helping us out in the store, and he had opened it that day. And we went in there -- we closed the store with the iron gates from the inside. The store had no bathroom, and nothing. We wen -- we went in there and we closed that. And this young man and I, and my mother and father stayed in there. We had a telephone, and my girlfriend kept us aware of what was happening. She also sent somebody with some sandwiches to po -- put under the door. We didn\u2019t know how long we didn\u2019t there -- we would be there. We stayed about 30 some hours in there, and even though it was so terrible, we told stories -- we had no light, we couldn\u2019t turn on a light. People knocked on the doors, and we didn\u2019t open. And then finally my girlfriend says they have lifted this terrible thing that -- of Kristallnacht, and she said, you can come out now, I think. But we were still scared. And when we looked out, the Nazis had put a swastika seal on the key lock -- on the -- where the key goes, and at that time the keys were these large keys with the long tops. And I took a key, the key from the inside, and I unlocked it, and it didn\u2019t tear. Because that would have been certain death. Nobody could hurt the swastika seal. We ha -- w -- I had an aunt that wa -- had no husband. She lived with her sister and her daughter, and my father went in to hide there, because they didn\u2019t expect a man to be there. And he spend the next two days there. The young man that was with us, was -- they looked for him many times. He would not have survived if he had been hiding with us. It was a horrendous day."

            "num": 20,
            "question": "What did you see? What was -- what was it like?",
            "answer": "A lot of broken glass. All Jewish businesses had been torched, or broken. All the merchandise was either looted, or thrown out. It was -- it was horrible. And w-we couldn\u2019t believe we survived it, or that my father survived it. And h-he came back home after two days, and we had no more stores, we had nothing, you know. I remember going out of the store, I even took money out of the cash register, I remember that. But we -- we- thank God we survived it, and we were looking for ways to get out of Vienna. As you know, nobody wanted us. No country wanted us. The countries, most of the time just were closed to us, and you couldn\u2019t get out of Austria unless you had a permit to go to another country. So we had no such thing. And then, after that, it was probably in January, my father got an invitation to come to the Gestapo. And nobody ever came back from that. And that same day, the same friend was visiting me, and my father said, \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d And -- and my mother says, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d He says, \u201cPll find something, but I\u2019m not going to the Gestapo.\u201d And this young man said, \u201cPlease take me with you.\u201d So they each put a shirt and a shaving brush into one of my dolls suitcases. I still had dolls with suit -- I never liked dolls, I liked teddy bears -- and put it into little suitcases like that, they each had one. And they left. And my father and I had made up a whole language between us. And they were gone. And a few days later, I got a call from Antwerp, Belgium. My father said, \u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re safe,\u201d and he told me what to do. And what he did was this, he got on a train from Vienna to Rotterdam. Well, there was no more border between Austria and Germany, but there was a border between Germany and Holland. And before he came to the border, he contacted one of the waiters that looked simpatico, and he said, \u201cI have money I\u2019d like to give you if you would hide my friend and me under table.\u201d And he said okay. So they got under table at the border, they put tablecloths over them, and then they stood in front of the table while they searched the train. They found the two little suitcases, and nobody claimed them, so they searched some more. In the meantime they had the heating unit in their back. They said it was unbelievable, and they couldn\u2019t move. But they finally left, they couldn -- nobody knew what happened to these men. So, when they got to Rotterdam, my father said to this young man, \u201cGet out of the train and stretch, and act like you\u2019re lighting a cigarette, like you\u2019re going to get back on, because they\u2019ll be looking for us. And then make your way to the exit, and go to the streets, and when you find the -- a place that has a kosher sign on it, they\u2019ll help you.\u201d And that\u2019s exactly what they both did. They found a place with a kosher sign. They went in and told them they were refugees, and what should they do. These people knew -- these Jews knew that in an -- in Belgium, in Antwerp, they were giving 30 day permits to people to stay. So they made them up false papers, and they send one by car, and one by bus to Antwerp. And that\u2019s how they got to Antwerp. And our family in Poland send us money -- send my father money so he could exist. And my father said to me, \u201cAnd you do the same with mother.\u201d And I said [indecipherable] gave me all the details, he described the waiter, and said, \u201cHe said he would help you. And have twice the money.\u201d So my mother and I packed up huge boxes, and send them to my father in Belgium. They did not get there, they took out all the valuables, but I do have my things that -- from my grandmother, and pictures, and all that really survived by going to Belgium. My mother and I got on the train, the train that we knew he would be on. We went into a compartment of people who were -- turn out to be some Jews, and there was one young man that had a shaved head. He had already been to a camp, and they let him out and said, \u201cIf we catch you again, you\u2019re dead.\u201d And they had no place to go. Nobody had any place to go, and I couldn\u2019t tell them what we were doing. I felt like a traitor, but I wasn\u2019t going to say, because there\u2019s no way that many could be under tables. We went to the dining car, and I spotted the waiter, and I s -- I -- sit in front of me -- I had the menu in front of me, and I spoke to him, and I said, \u201cI have twice the money, you promised my father.\u201d I identified myself. And he said to me, \u201cDon\u2019t speak to me, I\u2019m being watched.\u201d And that was the end of that. So here were my mother and I going into no man\u2019s land. We went back to the compartment and one of the people there had gotten a telegram from a friend that -- on the border in Achen -- no, in Cologne, in Cologne, there was a hotel, an hourly hotel, a fleabag hotel, who would allow Jews in -- un-under the eaves for a certain amount of money. So we went with them to this place, it was a horrible place. And they put us all under the eaves. They also had people there that smuggled people across, that came there, and for money they said, \u201cWe\u2019ll get you across the border to Belgium.\u201d So we -- we did this. I was a young girl. There was a waiter there who liked me a lot. My mother was hysterical with this, there was nobody to protect me. And I[ had to really get out of his way. And I learned a lot very quickly. And then we started with trying to be smuggled out. It took five weeks of unbelievable things. We were caught five times. There was ice and snow. My mother had a 105 temperature. And we used to walk like half the night through the woods, and then be caught and sent back. They didn\u2019t know what to do with the women, the men disappeared."

Some of them had bought out the border police, but not all of them, just some of them, and they\u2019d let us go on, and then later on we\u2019d hear a car coming, we\u2019d throw ourselves in a ditch. Then we\u2019d hear a motorcycle, and that didn\u2019t catch us, but then the man came on his mot -- on a bicycle, and he caught us. We once made it to no man\u2019s land, to a -- we had walked all night, and I had to go to the bathroom so bad, and they had an outhouse surrounded by German border police so I couldn\u2019t go, cause they all liked me, because I was a young, big girl with no protection. I -- we sat -- we were soaked to the skin, and we sat and waited to be picked up from the other side. And the German border police came and send us back again. And one of the -- one of the people there had send me a note that he was in love with me, and that he knew what I was doing, and he wanted to join me when I got out. And I should -- gave me his name and address I should write to him, and I said sure. And when the border police came in, I dropped it under the table, I didn\u2019t want to be found with that. And that was a terrible time. Each time they send us back as far as our money would go, and you become very wise, you know. The men disappeared, the women were sent back. You become wise, you know. You become street-wise. So after five weeks of this, constant trying to get across the border with fashing, which is Mardi Gras time in Cologne, going on with -- they wouldn\u2019t even have us at that hotel, we found some other place, and my mother was very ill. And we were like up under the eaves, and had -- we had no ration cards either, so we couldn\u2019t buy any food, and I would go out in the street, and I found this little cheese shop, cheese and bread. And the proprietor was this very jolly, nice, fat man. And I went in and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a ration card, but I\u2019m hungry.\u201d And every day he sold me cheese and bread, or every few days. So he was a good man. And my accent was Viennese, so in Germany they knew immediately that I wasn\u2019t from there. So they knew what I was doing. I once fell down a whole flight of steps, and two German officers picked me up, and I couldn\u2019t say thank you, because they would have known immediately that I wasn\u2019t German. We had a lot of terrible incidents like that. And then one day my father called and said he had found a Gestapo man who wanted money out of the country -- out of Germany, and he was smuggling people across. And he send him to us and told them he would pay him on the other side, so he could get money. This man made us first go to the border police and be searched. We were searched each time, everywhere. There was a woman searching women, and a man searching men all over the body. And then he took us -- we had to walk about three hours through the night, in the woods. And then he picked us up in cars without lights, and we drove for two hours without lights, at night. And then we drove into Antwerp, and he delivered us. I went into hiding for two weeks. I couldn\u2019t -- I was afraid to go in the street. It was an after in fact. I had another incident before that in Vienna when they made me wash the streets one day, the people that I knew and grew up with. And they taunted me, and they send away all the other people and they surrounded me, and started touching me. And German officers came in and stopped it. And I cried for two days and two nights, and had to have a shap to stop it. So here went again, I was scared to death. I was real brave until we got to Antwerp, and then I be -- I just let loose. And after two weeks of not leaving the place, my parents made me go to a movie with them. What they didn\u2019t know is there was a Communist giving a speech for the movie, and I was so afraid, because you get so afraid of anything political, or anything that has to do with the law, and --"

He had no money in the bank, he had five unmarried daughters, he had no insurance. He had to state all that, that when you guaranteed for family to come to the United States. We took that to the American consul in -- in Antwerp, his name was Leroux, and he was a very nice man, and I -- I spoke some English, and I said, \u201cI -- I want -- we\u2019ll work and we won\u2019t need any help,\u201d and -- and he believed me, and he said, \u201cOkay. The first visas I get for Austria, your mother and you will go, but your father can\u2019t because he was born in Poland,\u201d and Poland was a different quota. There was a -- there was a strict quota system of where you were born, only so many a year allowed into America, no matter what. So our visas came, and we had to leave, and leave my father behind. And it was a terrible goodbye, but he had promised me the first Polish quota would go to my father. And we -- we got to New York on March 10\". We went on a Dutch ship during the war -- already the war had started, through the channel. We had to anchor at night. The winds were the worst in March, of any time. The entire ship was seasick to such an extent that when we got to New York, a lot of people were taken off on stretchers, that\u2019s how bad it was. We had no music -- we had to -- there were sunken ships, and mines all over the place. I remember seeing them go by. We had to wear our what do you call it? So you don\u2019t sink? Our life preservers. We had to wear them day and night, and it was not a good crossing, but we made it. We made it, and came to New York. My mother had a brother that was in New York already, and he got us a room for three dollars a week, and we went to work the day we got there. My father, May the ninth send us a telegram that his passport was at the consulate, and he had booked passage on the 11\", and we woke up on the 10\", and Hitler had marched into Belgium.

I -- somebody knocked on the door on July the 18\"\", and there was Max, and behind him the Western Union boy with the telegram from my father that, I\u2019m alive.

But then he escaped from there into Marseilles. So that was -- you know, for two months we have no idea. But he did escape. And I got all kinds of papers for him. It took another year, and he did come to the United States. So -- the other thing I forgot to tell you is, while I was in Belgium, we were looking for ways to get out of Belgium, we heard that the Chilean consul had left town, and the [indecipherable] consul was selling visas to Chili. So immediately my parents send me in, and with our passports, and we bought visas to Chili. We picked up our luggage one -- aboard a ship to Chili, and we were spending the last night before the trip at home, when in -- midnight the doorbell rang, and in Belgium the houses are build one onto the other, all the bedrooms are upstairs, and you had these huge mirrors to see who is at the door. At the door was the Chilean consul with the car, with the flag. We knew immediately he came to cancel our visas. And I still have those passports, we cancel -- they cancelled the visa.

To be at the mercy of guides that dealt in human beings for money, and you really didn\u2019t know where they were taking you. It was awful to know that we had no ration cards, that nobody was to help us, that we didn\u2019t know anybody. We were just at the mercy of so many people. And even though there were a lot of good people in the world, not enough of them. Because we were afraid to speak to anybody. I was afraid to open my mouth. And 1-it was so awful when we walked through the woods in the middle of the night. One time they took us through a -- a train tunnel, and I -- I thought, what if the train comes? And we walked through tunnel for a long time. And then when we came out the other end, there was a street, a road, and -- not much of a road, but a road, and we were so relieved to be on the other side of that tunnel, and that\u2019s when we were caught again. And I was lying on the -- in a ditch when we heard something coming, and all of a sudden I had a gun in my ribs. And we came out of the ditch, and they took us all the way back, when we had gone through that whole tunnel, you know? And we had to g -- walk all the way back, and be searched again, and sent back to Cologne. And this happened so many times. It -- I think sometimes I don\u2019t even want to remember it all. I kind of slop over it because it\u2019s hard. Especially when my mother was so ill, and I didn\u2019t know what to do, you know, we -- we didn\u2019t have any medicine, we didn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t call a doctor, and here we were in -- in strange country, and hiding. And I\u2019m sure that a lot of people that went through a lot more than I did, but at that time, it was terrible. It was terrible because we had no protection of any kind."

I sometimes go through old pictures, and it brings back memories. I\u2019m lucky to have those old pictures, not everybody does. When I\u2019m with my cousins, I remember the times when we were all little together, and what has happened since. Max and I really never spoke German at home, mostly because we were angry, and didn\u2019t want our children to know the language. Our children were angry with us for not teaching them. But at that time we just didn\u2019t want any part of German. We talked to each other when we sm -- met somebody German that wasn\u2019t younger than us, didn\u2019t trust them. Didn\u2019t -- we were thinking, where were you? We still doing this a little bit. Not much, but a little. So, you could say we\u2019re still a little preyudiced, but we try not to be. The first time Max had somebody apply for a job as secretary who was German, we talked to each other, and he hired her, and she became a wonderful woman, and wonderful secretary. But I want everybody to think that way, that when they said all Jews were bad, and all Jews should die, I never want to do that about any class of people, including Germans. There were some good Germans who tried, and were afraid of their own lives. There were a lot of bad ones who wanted to take advantage of people. I could never understand the people that worked in concentration camps who did things they didn\u2019t have to do. Where were these men that could kill children, and then go home to their own children? How is it possible? How -- what kind of human being was that? And that -- I always ask myself that, how is it possible? I -- I can\u2019t -- and so we never wanted to hate anybody. And we taught that to our children, they know that.
