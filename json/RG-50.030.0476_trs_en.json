And it had approximately, I would say, seven or eight Jewish families. My grandfather Marx, Moses Marx, came from the Rhineland, Achen, and established himself there, married my grandmother, and had a -- a shoe business. He sold sh -- shoes all over the area. He went by bicycle many times, and we had the -- a regular store at the bottom of our building, which was quite big."

And Sevra stayed in Battenberg. My father was born in Fleet bachin Hesse, sort of as -- bigger town, which was what you call a Christstadt in German. And he went to a technical school to learn agronomy. And he was employed by a man named Louie Marx, who was my mother\u2019s brother. Ne -- not Louie Marx himself, but his -- his firma, which was at that time called Deutsch and Marx or something like that, I don\u2019t remember. And Louie Marx took my father once up to Battenberg, and this way my mother met him, and they became engaged, and married in 1926."

            "question": "So tell me about you.",
            "answer": "So my father, who was an academic man, had during the early years a very good job with the Whymara government, inst -- instructing the farmers how to slaughter, when to slaughter, the right time to sow, or to reap, because Germany was very much interested in having a good agricultural f -- f -- what you would call a method, to feed it\u2019s people without too much imports at that time. But in 1933, when Hitler came to power, my father lost his job, because he was government employed. And he took over my fath -- my grandfather\u2019s shoe business, but at that time already, it was going downhill, and he couldn\u2019t really make a very good living from that. So this went through a couple of months, even I would say a year or two, and the anti-Semitism came to Battenberg very early. It was really a nest -- I call it a real nest of Nazis, and trying to get rid of all the Jews, and specially confiscate their business. So my mo -- my father decided it was better for him, and for us, for the family, to move to Friedberg where his parents had a home. At that time in the Judengasser, which was at -- at very early times in the 16\" century, ghetto. But it was quite a nice little street, the houses were one on the -- one on the other, and we had the three floor house, my father put in plumbing, which by that time they didn\u2019t have there. And we children, I had a brother by the way, his name was Norbert, who was born two years after me, in 1930, went to school in Bard Nowheim, which was a spa approximately three kilometers from Friedberg and had a Jewish cabearks -- ca -- gaminda shula, excuse me. A -- as- a school that took in all the children from the surrounding area. It was located in a beautiful area, and had very good reputation as a -- a school of first class. And we went to this school till 1938, I would say -- \u00b039, I\u2019m sorry."

            "answer": "Yes. Well, unfortunately we were children, didn\u2019t realize the difficult times my parents went through, especially raising us, bringing in the money to send us to school, and to feed us and so on. My mother was very fragile, but my father was a very strong man. He was an officer in the first World War, so he was wounded, and had a paralysis on the right hand, and the right arm was completely stiff. He was wonderful, he was able to do everything with his left. And made sure that we children go to school, was -- got very disciplined, and my mother sort of was weak in this. And we -- when we wanted something, we always went to our father, especially me. I cannot talk to -- about my -- my brother, we sort of at that time were very young, and had many little fights, or spats, I would call them."

As a matter of fact, it was just finished when Hitler was in power, and he made a lot of propaganda for it. He wanted to imitate the Hoover dam at that time."

The one thing we had there, we had a neighbor who was -- his name was George, I don\u2019t remember his last name, he threw stones into our windows all the time, and we had constantly to repair windows. They were -- and we children were persecuted. We had to walk approximately one and a half miles to school, I would say, since we lived on the upper part of the town, and the ch -- the school was in the lower part. So children were already throwing stones at us, and we were ostracized. As a matter of fact, at the end they put us 1n the back row in school, next to the Gypsies."

            "answer": "I -- I -- I felt this per -- persecution, and an incident happened, I should really not tell this here, but it\u2019s -- since these Gypsies sat next to us, there were two boys, they all the time exposed themselves towards us, and played around with their sex organ, and that left a terrible impression on me all my life. And there was one Jewish -- one non-Jewish boy, who was the son of the physician in the town, who went up to the teacher and told her, and she actually did nothing about it, because she was part of the Nazi party. But my father realized it\u2019s time that we have to go. And since our immigration was pulled here, and pulled there, because of my father\u2019s injury during the first World War, it was s -- rejected by the US at that time, and we tried other countries, and you needed an awful lot of money, and since my father was not employed since 1933, it was very difficult. We lived really, on a very wealthy aunt, who send us money and -- and bought us clothing, and helped us all along, as long as she could."

We had -- my father was a -- a -- a - a special person to an old woman, who was in her 70\u2019s at that time. She came in the middle of the night to bring us some food.

So he didn\u2019t believe in any of these dietary laws. And sometimes he took us children along, and we tasted pork, and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell your mom.\u201d The first thing when we came into the house, naturally children say, \u201cDo you know where we went? Daddy took us to this and this farmer, and we had a wonderful bratwurst.\u201d And my mother almost exploded. But those were incidents that were still pretty good. And 1 -- when we were then in Friedberg, my father had a lot of friends. School friends, and he was a good athlete. He used to play very good football, and he used to belong to a league, and some of the Germans that tried to contact us -- or contact him, did so. But it got less and less as time goes on. And --"

Now, in my old age, I\u2019m searching for my background, and for different, and look into different religions, and I\u2019m comparing it to, specially Yoga, Redunta and Buddhism.

And the schools there was also a children\u2019s home, where children who -- who pa -- whose parents were already separated, or immigrated someplace.

You didn\u2019t have to live in this children\u2019s home to go to that school. It was called the besere -- Bitseerik shula. That means of the whole county, Jewish children could come by train, by bus, whatever. And I remember I have a very good friend, Eva Forest, whose -- whose maiden name was Warburg.

So through the joint Jewish community of the German gu -- [indecipherable] German Reich, at that time, made sure that children that didn\u2019t have the means to lodge there, to place them in homes, and also children\u2019s homes. And I would say we went there in beginning of 40 for about a year and a half, which was a wonderful experience. Frankfurt is a big city, very liberal for German standards. It was always against the -- the Kaiser, and had some prominent non-Nazis. So some of the Jewish institutions were still working, and one of them is the philanthrop -- was the philanthropine, the school that was boser [indecipherable] and a -- a part of the school taught even in English, you could get your diploma in English, and regular German folkshula.

In the morning they came for my father, and he was rounded up with a lot of men to Buchenwald, which we later found out that, we didn\u2019t know at that time. And my mother, since we had that three story building, had a big attic, my mother put us all the way up into the attic, and said, \u201cYou be very quiet when they come here.\u201d And they did come, but they never went the s -- above the second floor, but they threw out all our -- my mother had a lot of miesen, and porc -- other porcelain, crystal, threw it out of the windows. Demolished the dining room, and living room, sort of furniture threw out of the window. But physically we were not apprehended, because first of all they never knew where we children were, and weren\u2019t interested. And my mother, I have no recollection where she stayed. She must have stayed on the third floor also, and just watched. But my father was gone for about four and a half weeks, till he came back from Buchenwald. And I remember my mother preparing a bath for him. At that time we didn\u2019t have bathrooms like here, except we had a flush toilet. And she made hot water in a sink ba -- basin, and washed my father from top to head, because he was smelling so much. And the -- we continued to live in Friedberg during all this time, going to school in Frankfurt, and my parents living in Friedberg, coming occasionally to Frankfurt to visit us, to see how we are doing. And also on vacation time we went home. And in 1940, or \u00b041 -- I have a friend who could -- who knows the exact date, but I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember."

It meant you had to take a train from Frankfurt to Friedberg, which was possible. Even so, we were -- we wore the star, the yellow star already, and we had to be s-sitting in a certain compartment. And it was very shameful for us kids, somehow. I mean, we were a little bit intimidated, sitting where we were sitting. And -- but what I remember about this family is they had a housekeeper who came from Battenberg, and she had a terrible nervous condition, and shook with her hands, and her head, and this is now coming into my mind when I think about myself getting old, and sometimes I have these anxiety attacks, and I start to shake a little bit, and that brings me back to that time."

Every year there was, or every couple of months there was a raid that you had to bring certain things for the possible war that they are going to fight against the allies. And this was a very hard thing for my mother, to -- dawa -- to part with material possessions. I think I learned from that. I am giving away already now many of my possessions, and I am very grateful that I had a husband who made good money during his career, and I had a nice home, but I know that I will have to leave it, and I\u2019m trying to learn non-attachment to material things."

But at that time the Germans made big progress into Poland, then into France, and by that time a lot of Jews were already deported to the east, and we were lucky to be there yet till \u201940 -- lucky? I wouldn\u2019t say lucky -- till September \u201942, when we were rounded up. And as I said, our luck was that my father was an officer in the first World War, and he had the Purple Cross, the German ahtler, and whe -- we were privileged to go to Theresienstadt.

That\u2019s about all that -- but that enabled him for us, between my brother and myself, to get us into kinderheim. At first we thought we both were going to go to the kinderheim, but somehow or other there was such an overflow of children they didn\u2019t have enough room, so we had to choose between -- my parents had to choose between my brother and myself, and they decided that I should go to the kinderheim."

That was actually for me a wonderful experience, since food was naturally the first thing on our mind, but being with the same group of people, being able to communicate it, to learn. Because in the kinderheim, every room had a sort of a teacher that had to keep us busy. And I remembered we had a girl named Hoyman -- Eta Hoyman, she was very well known in Germany in the Zionist movement. And she read books with us, we learned history of Palestine, and it was a very good, wonderful experience. However, it didn\u2019t last, like nothing lasts. Unfortunately, my brother during that time became sick with typhus and was quarantined. My mother was terribly upset about it, and I had to try to cheer her up a little bit here and there, and I have made acquaintance with a pianist in Theresienstadt, and she was in the entertainment part, and she got us tickets to various performances.

Some of the other mates were so hungry, and at that time you were doing anything you could to get more food.

Our Czech brothers and si -- our Czech sisters that were -- came from Theresienstadt with us, we assembled on the plaza, and then gi -- Mengele came and selected about four to 500 women. Among them was me. I had held the hand of my friend Ruth Wertheim, who probably pulled me over, because I was so small, and sickly already. And he might not have seen it, 1t was dusk, and gray and evening, and we were put on the train, on the last wagon again, a closed train, and were taken to Mattsdorf and Reasonkeperga. We arrived there the next day, and were unloaded, and the thing was they didn\u2019t have enough room for us, so they quickly built Quonset huts on top of the factory, and that\u2019s where we were located. That was a -- an plus for us, because the heat rises up from the machinery that went on 24 hours a day in the factory, and we felt the first time a little warmth. And also, the factory had to get rid of dirty water that -- hot water that came out of the machinery, since they were cooled by water, and we washed ourselves, and we kept ourselves pretty clean during that time. But that was a time I got sick very fast, and a doctor came and put me in the infirmary. I was coughing, I had a mastitis which was draining. My I-le -- ma -- in ma - on my ri-right breast for eight months, even after we were liberated yet. It gave me terrible pain, and I had absolutely no incentive or will to live at that time any more. But my friend Ruth Wertheim, and Hannah Laura Breaker, both kept me going. One day as we were standing there and talking in appelle, somehow or other, the foreman of the factory came by, and he said, \u201cHow come you girls speak so well German?\u201d So we said, \u201cWe -- we are Germans. We went to German schools.\u201d He couldn\u2019t understand it. So next day he brought us an apple, and we divided the apple in three.

The -- the door was always open for the flax to be thrown in, which was also done by girls, and some French prisoners brought the heavy bundles.

I\u2019m reading a letter f -- about Judaism now, very -- pretty much at the end of my life, I want to return to my original upbringing, and so on. But I have reservations.

But once I met my husband, who was a mountain climber, a hiker -- I was also a hiker before that, I must say I have walked, I love to walk.

            "answer": "I-I think that is a question of development. I was very much impressed first with science. But science also does not give all the answers. And I was in the medical field, in laboratories, doing research, especially in human blood, and sera, and so on, and so forth. And routine analysis of all fluids. My husband also was a chemist, and we discussed a lot of s-sciences, and so on and so forth. It left me with some questions and doubt, and it was sometimes quasi quasi, there were not hundred percent answers to anything.

So this all has to be worked out by men. And I think I got wiser by having had this experience, and I wonder what the other side will bring, if there is another side, and so more learning, and more experiencing. We don\u2019t know.

So after that, my gynecologist, who was Dr. Gisela Pearl said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want children, just don\u2019t have them.\u201d And the sex life was not the most important thing for me.
