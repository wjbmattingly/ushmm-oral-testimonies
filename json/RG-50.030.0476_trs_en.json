And Sevra stayed in Battenberg. My father was born in Fleet bachin Hesse, sort of a s -- bigger town, which was what you call a Christstadt in German. And he we nt to a technical school to learn agronomy. And he was employed by a man named Louie Mar x, who was my mother\u2122s brother. Ne -- not Louie Marx himself, but his -- his firma, whic h was at that time called Deutsch and Marx or something like that, I don\u2122t remember.

            "answer": "So my father, who was an academic man, had during the early years a very good job with the Whymara government, inst -- instructing the farm ers how to slaughter, when to slaughter, the right time to sow, or to reap, because Germ any was very much interested in having a good agricultural f -- f -- what you would call a method, to feed it\u2122s people without too much imports at that time. But in 1933, when Hitler came to power, my father lost his job, because he was government employed. And he took over my fath -- my grandfather\u2122s shoe business, but at that time already, it was going downhill, and he couldn\u2122t really make a very good living from that. So this went through a couple of months, even I would say a year or two, and the anti-Semitism came to Battenberg very early. It wa s really a nest -- I call it a real nest of Nazis, and trying to 3 get rid of all the Jews, and specially confiscate their business. So my mo -- my father decided it was better for him, and for us, for the family, to move to Friedberg where his parents had a home. At that time in the Judengasser, whic h was at -- at very early times in the 16 th century, ghetto. But it was quite a nice little street, the houses were one on the -- one on the other, and we had the three floor house, my father put in plum bing, which by that time they didn\u2122t have there. And we children, I had a brother by the way, his name was Norbert, who was born two years after me, in 1930, went to school in Bard No wheim, which was a spa approximately three kilometers from Friedberg and had a Jewish cabea rks -- ca -- gaminda shula, excuse me. A -- a s -- a school that took in all the children from the surrounding ar ea. It was located in a beautiful area, and had very good reputation as a -- a school of first class. And we went to this school till 1938, I would say -- \u212239, I\u2122m sorry."

My mother was very fragile, but my father wa s a very strong man. He was an officer in the first World War, so he was wounded, and had a paralysis on the right hand, and the right arm was completely stiff. He was wonderful, he was able to do everything with his left. And made sure that we children go to school, was -- got very disciplined, and my moth er sort of was weak in this.

We had to walk approximately one and a half miles to school, I w ould say, since we lived on the upper part of the town, and the ch -- the school was in the lower part.

And there was one Jewish -- one non-Jewish boy, who was the son of the physician in the town, who went up to the teacher and told her, and she actually did nothing about it, because she was part of the Nazi party. But my father realized it\u2122s time that we have to go. And since our immigration was pulled here, and pulled there, because of my father\u2122s injury during the first World War, it was s -- rejected by the US at that time, and we tried other countries, and you needed an awful lot of mone y, and since my father was not employed since 1933, it was very difficult. We lived really, on a very wealthy aunt, who send us money and -- and bought us clothing, and helped us all along, as long as she could."

So he didn\u2122t believe in any of these dietary laws.

It meant you had to take a train from Frankfurt to Friedberg, which was possible. Even so, we were -- we wore the star, the yellow star alread y, and we had to be s-sitting in a certain compartment. And it was very shameful for us kids, somehow. I mean, we were a little bit 12 intimidated, sitting where we were sitting. And -- but what I remember about this family is they had a housekeeper who came from Battenberg, a nd she had a terrible nervous condition, and shook with her hands, and her head, and this is now coming into my mind when I think about myself getting old, and sometimes I have these anxiet y attacks, and I start to shake a little bit, and that brings me back to that time."

And this was a very hard thing for my mother, to -- dawa -- to part with material possessions . I think I learned from that. I am giving away already now many of my possession s, and I am very grateful that I had a husband who made 13 good money during his career, and I had a nice home, but I know that I will have to leave it, and I\u2122m trying to learn non-attach ment to material things."

Also, he was a very minor, minor official. My mother used to say he probably has to sweep the floors of the -- of the Judenrat, of the bigshots 14 there. That\u2122s about all that -- but that enabled him for us, between my brother and myself, to get us into kinderheim.

That was actually for me a wonderful experience, since f ood was naturally the first thing on our mind, but being with the same group of people, being able to communicate it, to learn. Because in the kinderheim, every room had a sort of a teacher that had to keep us busy. And I remembered we had a girl named Hoyman -- Eta Hoyman, she wa s very well known in Germany in the Zionist movement. And she read books with us, we learne d history of Palestine, and it was a very good, wonderful experience. However, it didn\u2122t last, like nothing lasts. Unfortunately, my brother during that time became sick with typhus and was quarantined. My moth er was terribly upset about it, and I had to try to cheer her up a little bit here and there, and I have made acquaintance with a pianist in Theresienstadt, and she was in the entertainment part, and she got us tickets to various performances.

Our Czech brothers and si -- our Czech sisters that were -- came from Theres ienstadt with us, we assembled on the plaza, and then gi -- Mengele came a nd selected about four to 500 women. Among them was me. I had held the hand of my friend Ruth Wertheim, who probably pulled me over, because I was so small, and sickly already. And he might not have seen it, it was dusk, and gray and evening, and we were put on the train, on the last wagon again, a closed train, and were taken to Mattsdorf and Reasonkeperga. We arrived there the next day, and were unloaded, and the thing was they didn\u2122t have enough room for us, so they quickly built Quonset huts on top of the factory, and that\u2122s where we were located. That wa s a -- an plus for us, because the heat rises up from the machinery that went on 24 hours a day in the factory, and we felt the first time a little warmth. And also, the factory had to get rid of dirty water that -- hot water that came out of the machinery, since they were cooled by water, a nd we washed ourselves, and we kept ourselves pretty clean during that time. But that was a time I got sick very fast, and a doctor came and put me in the infirmary. I was coughing, I had a mastitis which was draining. My l-le -- ma -- in ma - on my ri-right breast for eight months, even afte r we were liberated yet. It gave me terrible pain, and I had absolutely no incentive or will to live at that time any more. But my friend Ruth Wertheim, and Hannah Laura Breaker, both kept me going. One day as we were standing there and talking in appelle, somehow or other, the foreman of the factory came by, and he said, \ufb01How come you girls speak so well German?\ufb02 So we said, \ufb01We -- we are Germans. We went to 40 German schools.\ufb02 He couldn\u2122t under stand it. So next day he brought us an apple, and we divided the apple in three.

But once I met my husband, who was a mountain climber, a hiker -- I wa s also a hiker before that, I must say I have walked, I love to walk.

And I was in the medical fiel d, in laboratories, doing research, especially in human blood, and sera, and so on, and so forth. And routine analysis of all fluids. My husband also was a chemist, and we discussed a lot of s-sciences, and so on and so forth. It left me with some que stions and doubt, and it was sometimes quasi quasi, there were not 56 hundred percent answers to anything.

So this all has to be worked out by men.
