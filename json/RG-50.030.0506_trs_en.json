This was particularly true with respect to my father. When the Nazis got into power, they established all kinds of trade restrictions. My father was exporting feathers to Germany. While he was visiting Germany, he was arrested, allegedly for breaking their trade ru-rules. He was able to post bail, and he actually jumped bail. So he knew that if Nazis ever got into Poland, that he would be picked up. With the encouragement of my mother who said to him that if you are in Poland you will be arrested, if you\u2019re out of Poland, you may be he -- able to help us, she encouraged him to promptly leave the country. It being late August, my father\u2019s parents, being religious, said, the high holidays are coming, you should wait and leave until after the holidays. Well, my father left Poland from the port of Gdynia, or Gdansk in late August, with the last ship to leave a Polish port before the war started."

In my own mind, and perhaps this 1s fantasizing, I think of Werdiswow as being the Anna Tefka.

So I do remember that one night when the Nazis were first invading, we spent the night on the floor of a barn, lying on the floor, somehow feeling that that was safer than staying in our homes. That there was the noise of artillery in the background. And I am told a story about myself which perhaps is -- should embarrass me, but it doesn\u2019t, that apparently in the middle of the night, I got up, I felt the full bladder, and just relieved myself to the expense of a sleeping neighbor."

And apparently Topja wa -- who was su -- probably supposed to be looking after all three of us, seemed to favor Hanka, or Anita. Also remember being told that when she was two and I was one, that I was as big as she was. And, by the way, I was told that I was a 10 pound baby. Obviously I can\u2019t prove it."

Then in \u201946, my Uncle Norman showed up, together with his brother Maurice, and while Maurice went back to Italy, Norman stayed in the United States, got himself a little tan Oldsmobile convertible wi-with red leather seats and I thought he was real cool.
