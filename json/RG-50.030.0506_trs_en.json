            "answer": "Yes, I do know. Okay, on August 23\", 1939, when the Soviets and Nazis signed a non- aggression pact, there was the fear of war in the air in Poland. This was particularly true with respect to my father. When the Nazis got into power, they established all kinds of trade restrictions. My father was exporting feathers to Germany. While he was visiting Germany, he was arrested, allegedly for breaking their trade ru-rules. He was able to post bail, and he actually jumped bail. So he knew that if Nazis ever got into Poland, that he would be picked up. With the encouragement of my mother who said to him that if you are in Poland you will be arrested, if you\u2019re out of Poland, you may be he -- able to help us, she encouraged him to promptly leave the country. It being late August, my father\u2019s parents, being religious, said, the high holidays are coming, you should wait and leave until after the holidays. Well, my father left Poland from the port of Gdynia, or Gdansk in late August, with the last ship to leave a Polish port before the war started."

He had previously gone to the United States, where s -- the ship was going, on -- on a -- business trips. So I think to my young mind, the difference between this business trip and other business trips, was not apparent."

            "answer": "Well, my recollection is that when the war came, we fled to my father\u2019s village, ni -- which was relatively close to Krakow, called Werdiswow. In my own mind, and perhaps this 1s fantasizing, I think of Werdiswow as being the Anna Tefka. And as -- so we felt it being a small village, it was a quote, safer place to be with the Nazis swarming all over Poland."

So I do remember that one night when the Nazis were first invading, we spent the night on the floor of a barn, lying on the floor, somehow feeling that that was safer than staying in our homes. That there was the noise of artillery in the background. And I am told a story about myself which perhaps is -- should embarrass me, but it doesn\u2019t, that apparently in the middle of the night, I got up, I felt the full bladder, and just relieved myself to the expense of a sleeping neighbor."

And apparently Topja wa -- who was su -- probably supposed to be looking after all three of us, seemed to favor Hanka, or Anita. Also remember being told that when she was two and I was one, that I was as big as she was. And, by the way, I was told that I was a 10 pound baby. Obviously I can\u2019t prove it."

            "answer": "That it would be a small east European village with largely unpaved streets, and probably chickens running around the place, and most of the men being bearded, and Yiddish being spoken --"

My mother won -- who was a little bit older than my father, grew up when there was no Poland. It was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and so she spoke a perfect Hoke Deutsch. And the Germans -- I mean, I can go into some detail about her contacts with them, did not speak Spanish, and so she conversed with them as a citizen of a neutral country, not as a Jew, not as a Pole.

And I might add that while we were -- the first visas that we were able to obtain was to go from Berlin to Moscow to Shanghai and then hopefully the United States. To put this in a chronological time frame, we left Krakow in March of 1941. When I saw the movie, \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d I realized that we left Krakow a week or two before all the Jews were rounded up in the ghetto. ve always wondered whether we weren't very lucky in getting out just in the nick of time.

Was not a -- a quick or easy st - stay from March through July of \u201941, and as -- as -- on June 22\u2122 of \u201941, we were getting ready to leave for Moscow, the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarosa, and that avenue of exit was closed to us. We subsequently were able to get permission to go through Vichy, France to Spain, and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s a-another chapter. But before I leave this, and the RAF would come over most every night and drop bombs on Berlin. They had no idea where the bombs were dropping. It was more like a -- an annoyance, but it meant that just about every night, we would have to go down to air raid shelters. And I remember there was at least one time when a bomb fell pretty close to the building where we were and that needless to say, shook up pe -- shook up the people mo -- in more than one way.

And the ship left from what I believe was the port of San Sebastian, and set out for Havana and then New York. The -- because there was a lot of illness about the ship -- in fact, I was told that about six people had died in voyage, and that\u2019s a voyage that took almost six weeks, that my mother was anxious to get us off the ship as quickly as possible. I recall that there were live cattle aboard the ship, like four cows, because they didn\u2019t have refrigeration, or adequate refrigeration, and so in order to have meat for the passengers, you had the cows.

We disembarked in Havana, and in addition to the health concerns, we didn\u2019t have immigrant visas into the United States.

But the Hebrew teachers thought that Roosevelt was an anti-Semite because he didn\u2019t allow more Jews into the United States. So we had this feeling -- this sense, you know, that bad things were happening to Jews there. The other thing that you asked, when did I really get the recognition of this? I remember coming home from camp in August of \u201945, and my father was sitting on a camp trunk and crying because he had just gotten a telegram that his parents had died during the war. Then in \u201946, my Uncle Norman showed up, together with his brother Maurice, and while Maurice went back to Italy, Norman stayed in the United States, got himself a little tan Oldsmobile convertible wi-with red leather seats and I thought he was real cool. By that time he was speaking Italian and I think he kind of, you know, had the glow of It-Italian chic."
