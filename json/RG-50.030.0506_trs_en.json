This was particularly true with respect to my father. When the Nazis got into power, they established all kinds of trade restrictions. My father was exporting feathers to Germany. Wh ile he was visiting Germany, he was arrested, allegedly for breaking their trade ru-ru les. He was able to post bail, and he actually jumped bail. So he knew that if Nazis ever got in to Poland, that he would be picked up. With the encouragement of my mother who said to him that if you are in Poland you will be arrested, if you\u2122re out of Poland, you may be he -- able to help us, she encouraged him to promptly leave the country. It being late August, my father\u2122s pare nts, being religious, said, the high holidays are coming, you should wait and leave until after the holidays. Well, my father left Poland from the port of Gdynia, or Gdansk in late August, with the last ship to leave a Polish port before the war started."

He had previously gon e to the United States, where s -- the ship was going, on -- on a -- business trips.

In my ow n mind, and perhaps this is fantasizing, I think of Werdiswow as being the Anna Tefka.

So I do remember that one night when the Nazis were first invading, we spent the night on the floor of a barn, lying on the floor, somehow feeling that that was safer than staying in our homes. That there was the noise of artille ry in the background. And I am told a story about myself which perhaps is -- should embarrass me, but it doesn\u2122t, that apparently in the middle of the night, I got up, I felt the full bladder, and just relieved myself to the expense of a sleeping neighbor."

To put this in a chronological time frame, we left Krak\u00f3w in March of 1941. When I saw the movie, \ufb01Schindler\u2122s List,\ufb02 I realized that we left 12 Krak\u00f3w a week or two before all the Jews were rounded up in the ghetto. I\u2122ve always wondered whether we weren't very lucky in getting out just in the nick of time. And I mention the chronology because we were in Berlin for a total of four months. Was not a -- a quick or easy st - stay from March through July of \u212241, and as -- as -- on June 22nd of \u212241, we were getting ready to leave for Moscow, the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarosa, and that avenue of exit was closed to us. We subsequently were able to get permission to go through Vichy, France to Spain, and that\u2122s -- th at\u2122s a-another chapter. But before I leave this, and the RAF would come over most every night and drop bombs on Berlin. They had no idea where the bombs were dropping. It was more like a -- an annoyance, but it meant that just about every night, we would have to go down to air raid shelters.

I remember coming home from camp in August of \u212245, and my fa ther was sitting on a camp trunk and crying because he had just gotten a telegram th at his parents had died during the war. Then in \u212246, my Uncle Norman showed up, together with his brother Ma urice, and while Maurice went back to Italy, Norman stayed in the United States, got himself a little tan Oldsmobile convertible wi-with red leather seats and I thought he was real cool.
