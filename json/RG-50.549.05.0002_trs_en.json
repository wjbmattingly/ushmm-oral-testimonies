And they had a dairy store, dairy, eggs and butter and my dad, that was my dad\u2019s job in Karlsruhe.

He was the manager of the dairy department in a wholesale grocery store, and he had this job until he was deported to Poland in 1938.

            "answer": "They were very poor, there were ten children and my grandfather had a tailor shop, Sylvia Green 4 January 11, 1996 Page 4 tailoring shop, and there hardly was any food on the table and my mother\u2019 was the second oldest girl, the first one was a boy. So my mother had to raise all the younger children so she never had a childhood. She said she never played with children. They had a cradle made out of wood and she would look out the window and children were on the sidewalk playing hopscotch and she participated then, she was in an apartment upstairs and many times the cradle was turned upside down because she got so excited, but she never had time to really play with children, raising the rest of the family. My grandfather, I only saw him once or twice in my life. To me, he was a big man with a long beard, Orthodox, and my mother said that he never held any of the children on his lap, but the grandchildren he did. That one time we went to visit, I was on his lap and I braided his beard and my mother just stood there, she didn\u2019t believe that he let me do that."

When my dad worked, well the name was Pfankuch, he never had a vacation all his life because he didn\u2019t work on any Jewish holidays and we got a lot of holidays, so this was taken off as vacation. So my mother used to take us places or, also, we children, obvious, every summer you had to get out of the city, like otherwise you would die it seems like. The New Yorkers do that too, don\u2019t they? * Cerka (Cilly) Posner Farber, born Oct. 20, 1887 Sylvia Green 5 January 11, 1996 Page 5"

            "question": "Were you close with him?",
            "answer": "As children we were close in a way, but boys were raised entirely different than girls. A girl just had to smile and look pretty, that\u2019s all that mattered, and my brother had to be educated, so he didn\u2019t have a childhood. My dad wanted him to be a rabbi, is that all right the way I\u2019m holding that now? My dad wanted him to be a rabbi, my mother wanted him to be a college professor, so he was educated for both. So I was schooled, we had school, you went to school from eight till 12 and you went back in the afternoon from two till four, or from eight till one and three till five. Whenever he got out of school, he had to go to Hebrew Sylvia Green 6 January 11, 1996 Page 6 school, every day. So he didn\u2019t have much of a childhood either. And it was really interesting, after we met again after the war, he was married and I was married and so we talked about our parents and about our childhood, and the interesting part was the way I talked about our parents was not the same way he talked about his parents, which were our parents, you know. So he told me, he said, \u201cI was so jealous of you.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d I said, \u201cI was so jealous of you, you were so brilliant.\u201d And he said, \u201cI had to be. I had to study all the time, I had no childhood and you had friends.\u201d He didn\u2019t have any friends. \u201cYou always had friends, you always were playing or going places, doing things.\u201d And it was really interesting, we were jealous of each other. But it worked out well, I mean we got it out of our system and we didn\u2019t carry any grudges."

And he had to bring home A\u2019s, B\u2019s were not good enough. And, well, that\u2019s what I said, all you had to do was smile and you had to associate with the people they approved of. And you couldn\u2019t go with children they didn\u2019t approve\u2014especially my mother. My dad was a hard-working man."

            "num": 16,
            "question": "Were they friends from school, or from?",
            "answer": "Well, at the beginning I had Gentile friends, but then when Hitler came to power, they Sylvia Green 7 January 11, 1996 Page 7 got sparse, less and less friends. And it\u2019s really interesting you asking that, I still remember Fritz Oler, we were raised together and I loved Fritz as much as I liked my brother, loved my brother Bernard. And then when Hitler came to power, he disappeared. If we passed on the street, he wouldn\u2019t see me. If I passed on the street when it was dark, at that time we used to go out in the evening, at the beginning, later on we didn\u2019t go out too much in the evenings, he would look, stare at you like no recognition, but then he would take his hand and wave at you in the back, so he wouldn\u2019t been seen. So but that really hurt, because in a way I knew that the reason for it because I was a Jew, but it\u2019s very hard for children to accept. You, you take it personally. Because I would cry, I came home and I saw some of the girls I used to play with and they run away. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she like me any more? I haven\u2019t done anything to her.\u201d That\u2019s hard. And they probably went home and talked to their parents, also, how bad they felt, you know."

I mean, what happened you remember, but to remember the exact date, because I started at such a young age and so many things happened until \u201845, and nothing was good really. So, but what they didn\u2019t know, we got a much better education than we did in public school because they wouldn\u2019t let Jewish college professors teach, so we got the college professors to teach us.

You know, I usually talk with my hands! It\u2019s hard. I\u2019m sorry. Well, I would always be in the front row, many blocks away from where I lived, and I was there in the front row with everybody everybody else, and everybody yelling, \u201cHeil Hitler!\u201d Here, he always came in a convertible and, naturally, he would hold his hand on the belt, I can close my eyes and see him, \u201cHeil Hitler, Heil Hitler,\u201d and people just went crazy screaming, you know. And they all were Sylvia Green 9 January 11, 1996 Page 9 running and I was right there with them. And he wouldn\u2019t let them get too close and then he just would take his hands, slowly, and everybody would go back. It\u2019s just like you were hypnotized, you know? So this was \u201833, but really, \u201832, already it started. There were Communist parties, Nazi parties, Socialist parties, and they always scheduled marches about the same time and there always, somehow there was a shooting going on, and they yelling and they used to hit each other. And my mother always used to grab my hand and, \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs, let\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d \u201cNo, I want to see what goes on!\u201d In \u201832, you know, I was eight years old, I was nosy."

I mean, my parents knew, my mother knew, middle in the night we heard that whistle, and it was my brother came home, that was in \u201838.

Germany did not want to get stuck with the people without a country, so that\u2019s why they pushed them to the border and the Polacks were shooting and the Germans were shooting and somehow they came to an agreement.

So my mother was sick and she sent me. So I went there and when they called my mother\u2019s name, I stood up and apologized that my mother couldn\u2019t be here, but I\u2019m here and I will give her the message, whatever the meeting is about. He yelled at me to come forward, he > Stateless (German) Sylvia Green 12 January 11, 1996 Page 12 yelled so hard and I was a child, you know I was 15 years old and we were children at 15, not, not the children, 15 seemed like they\u2019re very grown up, but we were not, we were children.

Well, I couldn\u2019t hold the pencil, my hand was just shaking, so he took his gun out and put it to my temple.

They were even smiling because you heard them downstairs already yelling and screaming, and by the time they came up, they start shooting and they didn\u2019t even notice that they were already dead. And I don\u2019t know what happened to my mother, I thought my mother might have ended up in one of the concentration camps, Sylvia Green 26 January 11, 1996 Page 26 but she might have been shot in the ghetto because they were just shooting left and right."

And he was not very sympathetic, he said, \u201cThe barracks are clean. Look at the nice care package. What are you complaining? People are getting killed, there is a war going on, you got it good here.\u201d So we told him, we said, \u201cWe will have to return those, we can\u2019t even touch it. The order was to open it up, but not to touch it.\u201d And they took those care packages away, but it was so upsetting to us that he didn\u2019t believe us, the representative from the Red Cross."

And then, but by the time we were sent back to Plaszow, we did not work in Kabelwerk any more. This was September, \u201843. And when I got there, well, we had to work in the concentration camp, we had to open graves, pull out gold teeth and the people who were in charge of this place were prisoners, German prisoners and they were completely out of control. I mean they were murderers, they were in prison because they were murderers from way before the war and they let them out to, to oversee us. And the guy\u2019s name, Hermann [ph], oh wow, he was crazy, he really was crazy. I saw Goeth many times and as soon as we heard he was walking in the camp, I was running away because we knew he was target shooting, he didn\u2019t care what you looked like, he was just target shooting, he wanted to see how close he could shoot or how far he could shoot. And Schindler was with him many times and they were drinking buddies. And I really don\u2019t think Schindler, well, he saved a lot of Jews and like they say, who saves one life, saves the world, but I can guarantee you this man did not start out to save the Jews. He started out to, to fill his pockets and somehow I think towards the end, he found out that it\u2019s a losing war they\u2019re fighting so he changed his mind. But, thank God he did because he saved a lot of Jews. But this was terrible, I mean in Plaszow, whether we had to go outside and load railroad tracks again or in, if we worked inside, then we had to dig, I mean open the graves and pull out the gold teeth or we carried barracks, they were always Sylvia Green 33 January 11, 1996 Page 33 building barracks and we had to, to carry that stuff. And really my legs are my weakest, my, my health problem, are my legs. You can\u2019t work like a dog, like a man, and not come out scarred. So we were there until, oh, I didn\u2019t tell you about my cousin, Janek Haubenstock. When we came back in September *43, people were telling me about my cousin, Janek. He and a little boy were walking in the concentration camp and, evidently, Goeth was walking towards him and my little cousin Janek had a habit, he drove his mother crazy, when he was upset he would whistle. He didn\u2019t even know he did this. And somebody told me that he was whistling, that, it was a Russian song or a French anthem, I don\u2019t know, I wasn\u2019t there, and they arrested him right there, in \u201c43, and they built a gallow to hang him, all night long, and the next day they brought him out to hang him, they made his father sit in the front row, my uncle, Henek Haubenstock, and the rope broke. So he sent somebody for a new rope and my poor little cousin, must have been just scared to death, and he was crawling up to Goeth\u2019s foot and kissing his boot. And they said that he was just hissing, Goeth took the gun out and shot him right there. My uncle saw it and he had a complete stroke, never came back from it because when I went up there, I went to see him in Plaszow, in that concentration camp where it all happened, he was just a vegetable."

Somebody had, had to survive to tell the world, we did not know that the world knew about it. We thought everybody was just ignorant about it, you know, they did not know. And I don\u2019t know, don\u2019t ask me whether, people say you must have been very healthy. I wasn\u2019t any healthier than the ones who died next to me because I had typhus, for two weeks I don\u2019t remember anything. I was so sick and we had to stand appell and they would drag me out, which I did not know, and they stood me up, holding me up. The only thing I can think of is, my time was not up. Somebody still had some purpose and also, I don\u2019t know, maybe it was a strong will to live, to tell the world. But my world crumbled pretty quick after I came to the United States, when I found out the world did know and didn\u2019t do a thing about it.

And I\u2019ve still got a lot of why\u2019s, thank God I got over the bitterness. The bitterness doesn\u2019t work, it eats you up alive and it, it doesn\u2019t harm the people you hate. It, I couldn\u2019t even talk German after the war, a complete blank. I blocked it out.

I connect it with Hitler, it\u2019s not beautiful, it\u2019s terrible.\u201d And then to meet people who had anything to do with Germany or German descent, I had to run away. And this kind man helped, he was so kind, because I just wanted to shut the door and that\u2019s it, not think about it and when I got married, and even after, I was an atheist, I didn\u2019t believe in anything, I really didn\u2019t. And so after I got married, I still did not talk about it to anybody. It was like I was ashamed of it, like some of it was my fault, you know. And I knew it wasn\u2019t, but somehow I just couldn\u2019t talk about it and then it was a small town with not many Jewish people, I already had one monkey on my head to be a Jew in a small town, and, but the door would not stay shut when I got pregnant.

So I was pretty lucky to have a wonderful husband and the children are great, they really are. They\u2019re loving, very loving. I said that in the documentary, I did not want to raise them full of hatred. In fact, they didn\u2019t know much about the Holocaust till I made that documentary. I want them to, want to raise them healthy, happy and, physically and mentally, and they got problems, I mean everybody\u2019s got problems, but the problems are not connected with my past. Because I did set myself a goal that if I fail, then Hitler had won out, and he didn\u2019t because they\u2019re loving children, they really are big hearts."

And Krakow, Auschwitz is not that far from Krakow, but it took such a long time because the train stopped every few feet because the planes were bombing. And before we got into the cattle wagon, they gave us some bread and that was all. And there was a container with water, and one container for the bathroom. And they stopped and gosh, were we pray, praying. Yeah, they jumped out of the, the trains, and they were hiding in ditches, the German, and we were laughing, we really were laughing. There was a little window up Sylvia Green 37 January 11, 1996 Page 37 in top, those cattle wagons, the old ones, and we would get on each others\u2019 shoulders to lift them up to see so we could get a good laugh because they were so scared.

They couldn\u2019t get any orders, they didn\u2019t know whether we end up in the, should end up in the gas chamber or at the camp. And we just sat. And it was cold, it was January. And finally there still were no orders, but then we took, I guess they were afraid to send us to the ovens, if the orders came that we should not been killed, they couldn\u2019t bring us back after they once gassed us, you know. So then they told us to go in to showers and we took the shower, naturally there\u2019s never enough water. And then we walked Sylvia Green 38 January 11, 1996 Page 38 out in the nude, in January in Poland, shivering.

            "question": "Were you still with your aunt?",
            "answer": "Yeah. We were liberated together. Let\u2019s see, after about 12 or 14 days in Auschwitz, we were shipped back in the cattle wagon to Bergen-Belsen. And when we got to, I think 1t was still January of \u201844, because we were pretty much one of the first ones there. When we came to Bergen-Belsen, they had nothing but tents and then there was a big storm one night and it was quiet, there was no shouting and it was very quiet in comparison to Auschwitz, there was so much commotion constantly. It was very quiet and my aunt said, \u201cYou know, Sylvia, in comparison to Auschwitz, this is a vacation.\u201d But we didn\u2019t know that was...1t was no gas chambers, but it was a starvation camp. They just starved you to death. So there weren\u2019t that many people, but then we had a big storm and it knocked all the tents down and they moved us to barracks. And they were looking for somebody who spoke a lot of languages, so I applied for it. I spoke German fluently, by that time already, I spoke Polish fluently, but couldn\u2019t read or write it because when you\u2019re young you pick up languages, they said I spoke it with a heavy accent. So I applied for it and I knew about three words of French, or maybe five words, and two words of Russian, so I got the job, not very long, though, but enough that I had a foot in the kitchen. And so I could steal food so my aunt wouldn\u2019t be hungry. So there were Jewish people working in the kitchen and some Russian soldiers working in the kitchen, and there were three Frenchmen. They were college students and Sylvia Green 40 January 11, 1996 Page 40 they worked with the underground, Gentiles, and they got caught. So they were funny, they were so funny. They all spoke German and wouldn\u2019t let the German know that they spoke German. And they would sing, and they would sing the French anthem, and they would laugh and they made us laugh. But the Russian people, we had to stay away from \u2018em. When when we stole food, we didn\u2019t tell on each other, but the Russians told on us when they saw us stealing food. They kept to themselves pretty much, we were afraid of \u2018em. So, well, I got typhus in the, back in Belsen, and Paul Lepitre, one of the Frenchmen, stole food and sent it to the camp, so by the time I got the food, there wasn\u2019t that much food left because she shared it with other people, but evidently 1t must have helped some. And when I got better after two weeks, I noticed that I didn\u2019t have any shoes, I don\u2019t know what happened to \u2018em, my shoes, and I told the girl, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t go back to work in the kitchen without shoes.\u201d So Paul Lepitre stole some man\u2019s boots and sent it to the camp with a friend of mine. And after I went back to the kitchen, those three Frenchmen hoisted me up on their shoulder and they were marching and they were singing La, what is it, La Marseillaise, the French anthem. Ach, the German, I\u2019m telling you, they would get so red and yell and we\u2019d say, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a stroke, he\u2019s going to have a stroke.\u201d But no, not such luck. And we were liberated April the 14\"..."

            "answer": "...of \u201c45. It was really strange, by that time I wasn\u2019t working in the kitchen any more, nobody was working anywheres because there was no food and they already knew that they Sylvia Green 41 January 11, 1996 Page 41 were in bad shape because the guards were disappearing there and they came back, there was no place for \u2018em to go. We didn\u2019t know that, they were surrounded by the Russians, by the British and by the Americans, and there was no place to run around, so they were digging ditches. And oh, they were angry, I\u2019m telling you, you couldn\u2019t even set a foot out, if not, you got shot. So we stayed pretty much indoors and everybody was sick, no energy, no water, no food and then I got dysentery problems again. I went out one night to relieve myself and I felt something cold I was sitting on and I looked, it was a body and I just moved over. I mean, you got, evidently, you got conditioned to that. I mean, just thinking about tt, it blows my mind, you know. And I crawled back in. So one night, it was between 14th and 15th, the night, or was early in the morning, we heard a lot of tanks rolling and rolling and rolling, we didn\u2019t know what was the matter. And it was morning and somebody came running in, \u201cWe are liberated! We are liberated!\u201d And they said, \u201cBy the British Army, we are liberated!\u201d Well, I crawled out there and my aunt went out there, too. I said, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d The German commanders, they were standing in front of the tanks, they tied them down evidently, I don\u2019t know. And they, with no medals, they stripped them of all the medals, but I didn\u2019t see that. I still saw the Nazis, I said, \u201cWhat you talking about? Here they are.\u201d And then we found out we were liberated, and I stood up, then I start singing the British anthem, God Bless the King, I remembered that from school. And, ah, there was such, so much commotion going on. They were so wonderful. And they gave us care packages, we didn\u2019t know how to handle those care packages, we ate everything! And that\u2019s Sylvia Green 42 January 11, 1996 Page 42 why so many died, on that starvation diet for so many years and then you drank cocoa, I mean the powder, and coffee, you smoked cigarettes, chocolate, all at one time and sardines. They meant well, I mean they didn\u2019t mean any harm. But I think that the world learned from that, whenever prisoners come back, they kind of condition them slowly with food."

If not, they\u2019d be still standing there today. I mean, it had to be like to say 550, it had to be 550. If not, they went back in the barracks and they counted the dead.

And I gave it to that British soldier I Sylvia Green 45 January 11, 1996 Page 45 met and he sent this letter to his mother in England and his mother, his parents, forwarded that letter to America, to Urbachs, Lexington, Kentucky. And at that time, Lexington, Kentucky was small, there were about 65,000 people, so everybody knew each other, so it got there just, Leon Urbach, Lexington, Kentucky, United... USA. So my brother was in the American Army, he, Urbach sent him an affidavit from England to come to the United States in 1940 and he was drafted in \u201c41. So he was still serving in the American Army, he was with Intelligence, he spoke seven languages fluently. And the Urbachs got in touch with him. And he came to Bergen-Belsen, and I think I told you that previously, when they came running in, telling me that my brother was out there. And I run out and all in a sudden I just stopped. I thought my dad was there because they look so much alike. So then he took us to Munich, he was stationed in Munich, my brother was stationed in Munich. And he sent an ambulance after us, I think 1t was around October, \u201845. When he came to the camp, he brought oranges, food, and ah, we, we just had a party.

They didn\u2019t tell us about it, we would Sylvia Green 51 January 11, 1996 Page 51 have been scared to death. But I would say there were about 800 passengers, maybe with the crew also, 1t was a very small ship. And it was not equipped, it was not a luxury liner.

From Karlsruhe?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d And she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, do you remember Berndt Weissman?\u2019 I said, Sylvia Green 52 January 11, 1996 Page 52 \u201cYeah, I went to school with him, the, the Jewish school.\u201d He had a speech defect and the children were not very kind to him and children can be cruel. So she said, \u201cWell, I really didn\u2019t have you on my list, but I looked at the list and I saw Sylvia Farber and I wanted to greet you, so I switched with somebody and I want to say, welcome to America and thank you for being so nice to my son, Berndt.\u201d And that kind of felt good that people remembered you, you know. And he was such a nice boy but the kids just didn\u2019t give him a chance, he was very intelligent, his father was a doctor, I don\u2019t know what happened to him, lost contact. So while we were talking, my cousin came with other cousins. The other cousins, but I didn\u2019t know the other cousins, they were waiting for that one cousin, he had to sign for us. And he came and he looked like a Farber, he looked like my dad, he looked like my brother and we just start hugging and kissing, you know. It seemed like the Farber, the looks go through the family, it\u2019s amazing."

Because I was older than their daughter, five and a half years, and I could stay out longer on a date. And she resented that. She said, \u201cThey love you more than they love me.\u201d They really were great people. But we didn\u2019t stay very long. My brother came in September and we rented an apartment and we lived on my brother\u2019s Army pay, ninety dollars a month, forty-five dollars rent. Water bill was cheap, two dollars, electric bill and we made it, can you imagine? And we only had hamburger on Sundays. But we wanted to be independent, Urbachs didn\u2019t want us to leave, but we wanted to get started. So my brother start teaching languages, he, he was working on Sylvia Green 54 January 11, 1996 Page 54 his undergraduate degree and he was tutoring in French and German and sometimes he didn\u2019t go to bed until two, three o\u2019clock in the morning because he had to do his own homework.

So I remember Joe Wile said to me, \u201cWhat are you doing on the floor?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m not stupid, I can do better than that, just wrap packages.\u201d And, well, normally a clerk couldn\u2019t have said that, but then, I didn\u2019t have the clothes I was supposed to wear, supposed to wear dark clothes, navy blue or gray or black. I didn\u2019t have it, he told me, \u201cYou wear what you got.\u201d So he really made, made allowances for me. In fact, people must have talked about this\u2014a Holocaust survivor\u2014and another department store, Martin, the buyer, I don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t think she came in to Wolf Wile\u2019s, she must have waited outdoors or something, she came up to me and she said, \u201cI really would like for you to work for Martin\u2019s. How much money do you get at Wolf Wile\u2019s?\u201d And I said, \u201cEighteen dollars a week.\u201d She said, \u201cWe can do better than that, we can pay you twenty-five dollars.\u201d So, I said, \u201cLet me think about it.\u201d So I went to Joe Wile, I thought that was the right thing to do because he gave me the chance. The factories where I applied in Lexington wouldn\u2019t hire me because I couldn\u2019t speak English fluently. Now, you could sue \u2018em because you discriminated, but at that time you didn\u2019t know about suing people. So I told him, I said, \u201cListen, they approached me at Martin\u2019s and they would pay me twenty-five dollars a week.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, 1f Martin\u2019s can pay you twenty-five, I can give you twenty-five.\u201d I did feel guilty because the people I worked with, some been working there ten, 20 years and didn\u2019t make more than twenty-five or twenty-seven dollars, but I told him, I said, \u201cYou know, we need the money.\u201d He said, \u201cI know.\u201d So people in Sylvia Green 57 January 11, 1996 Page 57 Lexington were very nice, very decent."

It was eight-twenty, eight-thirty, quarter to nine, no Jake Green. I got undressed, I put my slack suit back on, I was madder than a hornet. I wasn\u2019t used to be stood up.

It\u2019s like a cul-de-sac, you know, it\u2019s a circle. So that\u2019s how I met my husband and we went out dancing and I don\u2019t know, the evening passed by so fast and I ask him now, I said, \u201cHow could you understand me, I couldn\u2019t even understand myself.\u201d He said, \u201cIt was very easy.\u201d I learned a little Jewish, Yiddish and he knew a little Yiddish and some German and some English, we had a marvelous time and we both like to dance. And we dated about a year and a half and we got married January the 16\", 1949, which is going to be 47 years, a long time. My brother said, \u201cTt won\u2019t last.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d He had nothing against Jake, he just said, \u201cNobody could live with you any longer ten days to three weeks.\u201d "

We couldn\u2019t even venture out the barracks, because if they saw somebody venturing out, you just took your life into your hand. They were digging ditches, they were going to blow up the camp. And, really all... we all were in a semi-conscious state. And I remember I crawled out, I did not walk out. I Sylvia Green 65 January 11, 1996 Page 65 crawled on all four. And somehow, I had the energy, I don\u2019t know where it came from, I stood up, and I sang God... well, the British anthem, \u201cGod Save the King.\u201d I learned that in school. So, they were wonderful. I think the first thing they did, they took us to delousing. This camp was just completely diseased. It was typhus and lice and any kind of disease you want was found in there. And so many piled up that\u2019s all... the, the, the ones that died. And so they took us to delousing, and they gave us clean clothes. And delousing usually was, with the German, too, you left your... you went in through one door, you, you, you walked in the nude in the shower, and then, after you came out, and they sprayed you. So then they gave us a box of food. And it was like a ration. And I remember I ate everything in sight. I did not know what instant coffee was, and powdered milk, and sardines and cigarettes, and chocolate. That whole thing was consumed in the, in the few minutes."

            "answer": "No, no, no. They had a Holocaust reunion in Karlsruhe, 50 years after Crystal Day. I did not know anything about, because I was the only survivor in this part of the country. And some people I knew in New York, they went, and I met one of them at one of the weddings I went to. And she said, \u201cWould you have gone? I feel bad. I should have notified you, but I didn\u2019t think.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I would not have gone. I don\u2019t want to go there.\u201d My brother went back. My brother was with Borden\u2019s export and import, and he was in Europe a lot, so he was close by, and we had a friend, Fritz Oler. Before Hitler, he was our friend, then he didn\u2019t know us, you know. So he wrote Fritzle a letter, and Fritz wrote him back and he said, \u201cI want you to come home with me, and we going to have dinner together, you meet my wife, you meet my children.\u201d And Bernard said wait a minute. He wrote him, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to your home. Let\u2019s just meet at the neutral place, in the park, or the depot, just somewheres.\u201d Because, too many hard feelings there. And they met, and Fritzle was happy, Bernard, he... Bernard wanted to make his peace with Karlsruhe. So Fritzle was talking and Bernard was talking, and Fritzle said that his Sylvia Green 76 January 11, 1996 Page 76 parents were still alive. Bernard jumped up, and walked away, didn\u2019t say good-bye or anything. He came back to the United States, Sarah my sister-in-law told me, he walked into his home, went to the telephone, calling me, \u201cThere is no justice, there is no justice.\u201d Fritz Oler... Fritz was like a brother, really. We were raised together, and my mother and Frau Oler were close friends. And then, when Hitler came to power, her husband became a big wheel in the SS. And I was scared of the man. I don\u2019t know, I... how can you be that close, and then all in a sudden looking at you like, \u201cI\u2019m going to come at you and kill you?\u201d And I got the picture of... well, that\u2019s, the picture wouldn\u2019t help you, and I got... here. It\u2019s right in the front. Oh-oh. That\u2019s Fritzle. That\u2019s me."

October, \u201838, and we had to leave Karlsruhe by August, \u201839. So we had the pictures. So, in Poland, my Aunt Mina Sylvia Green 77 January 11, 1996 Page 77 had a very good friend, we thought. She gave her silver to her, fur coat, her china, her linen. And the linen, everything was hand monogrammed, even sheets were hand- monogrammed, everything. And my aunt gave her everything and her pictures and my pictures. So my Aunt Mina had the maid before the war, so after the war was over with, Mina wrote to Yulche [ph], the maid, to go to the people and tell them that she was alive and then that Mina was going to call her or talk to her, how to ship that... her stuff here to the United States. So when Yulche went there, the woman opened the door and she... and Yulche said that Mina was alive, and she said, \u201cOh, that poor woman is still alive?\u201d She said, \u201cWell, you write her that right after she left all that stuff with me, the German came and took everything away. I do have the pictures.\u201d So, we were so thankful for those pictures, because the other stuff was material things, you can live without it, but the pictures, Mina... we really were happy. And a lot of those pictures are my Aunt Mina\u2019s. Have you ever seen a picture of her?"

So this, well, they were trying to do it in \u201881, and I wouldn\u2019t do it.

It\u2019s called kaddish and you need ten men, at that time. Now women count, too. And so, they felt more like brothers and sisters. And I told her, I said, \u201cWell, ?'m going with that fellow in New York.\u201d And she was just after me and after me, so George and I had an understanding that we were going to date other people, since we were that far apart, to learn about the American way.

Sandy was the only Jewish child in the school system, the only Jewish child in high school, and she had a stupid teacher, homeroom teacher, who... 1t was before Christmas, said one morning, \u201cI was driving up and down Boone Avenue, all the houses were decorated for Christmas beautifully, except Sandy\u2019s house. Let\u2019s take up a collection.\u201d How do you think she felt? She came home and she cried, you know. Stupid teacher, he knew why. He thought he was funny. I don\u2019t know. He was crazy, anyway. And then she was... well, if they would have had valedictorian, she was the valedictorian, she got the junior cup. All A\u2019s, from the first grade on. And the minister\u2019s son came up to her, \u201cI would love to date you, but my father would kill me.\u201d So she came home and she cried, and I laughed, and I said to her, \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t be so happy about it either,\u201d you know.

We never were less than 14, sometimes 20 people, sometimes 11 people. So what else could I have done? I mean, you come to a point that they have to do it themselves. And I thought they had enough background. Sandy later belonged to a Conservative synagogue, but they only go on High Holidays and I think a lot... the rabbi has a lot to do with it. They had the rabbi, that\u2019s why they joined it, he was wonderful. He was great with young people. They... they went all the time, but this one, he\u2019s such a bore. The first time I went down there, and they were walking around... I don\u2019t know, have you ever... were you ever at services, Jewish services, when they walk around with the Torah, and you kiss the Torah? He was walking around, he didn\u2019t carry a Torah, and he was shaking hands, and I had my hand out. And I said, \u201cRabbi, I\u2019m Sandy\u2019s daughter,\u201d... I mean, mother, \u201cSandy is my daughter.\u201d And he said, \u201cOh.\u201d And then I went... Oh, I went a lot last year. And I even would go more, but I won\u2019t drive, and I have to fly, and Sandy\u2019s been paying for the flight for me to get there, and so I want to kind of slow down on that.

So, whenever... everywhere I am, I go to Saturday morning Sylvia Green 112 January 11, 1996 Page 112 services, because I always say I\u2019m a reborn Jew, I was Bat Mitzvah 11 years ago, because women couldn\u2019t participate when I was a child.

And when I was Bat Mitzvah, there were two other young girls. I\u2019m the only old woman who was Bat Mitzvah, and I don\u2019t know whether I did it as much out of religion, as I was... I think I was jealous of my brother, as a child. All that attention and all the gifts. And here, I knew every speech, I knew his Torah reading, I knew his Haftorah reading, I knew his speech by heart, as well as he did. And they made such a big deal over him. So, I don\u2019t know, in my speech 11 years ago, I said, \u201cYou probably are asking why I\u2019m doing this now. I raised my children in a kosher home, in the Jewish religion, to the best I could. I don\u2019t know whether that has anything to do with the religion, I am Bat Mitzvah, or it was jealousy. I had to prove to myself I could do it.\u201d That was my speech. And I said, \u201cI doed it.\u201d But, it was a lucky thing, because it helped me a lot in... after Jake died. The people are wonderful, they... I\u2019m almost the oldest one there, and they\u2019re all young couples, so \u2019ma grandmother. And then, after Jake died, they came for a whole week here, just saying prayers. And you only need ten people to say prayers. Now women count, too, men and women. Sometimes we had up to 30 here, because they wanted to come. And if I don\u2019t go on a Saturday, I miss it. I go every Saturday, even we had the little bit of snow, and they got mad at me after I walked in. \u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t be here, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be out.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s supposed to have melted by the time I drove home.\u201d But I miss it, and I feel like this is my family. And in fact, I think I told you, last Saturday, they Sylvia Green 114 January 11, 1996 Page 114 called me up to say a special prayer, before you read the Torah, or was it between you read the Torah, and I cried, I couldn\u2019t help it. And, so the one who read the Torah raf, he said, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Sylvia?\u201d And I said, \u201cI feel so alone.\u201d Yeah, they were wishing me a happy birthday and clapping, and in Hebrew, congratulations, you know. And so, I don\u2019t know, I just looked around, there was no... I mean, there were people there, but I was alone. And I told the Torahfa, he said, \u201cWhat are you talking about? We are your family.\u201d That was sweet. And it helped."

I had a very active grandfather. Or... stillborn, miscarriage, and only the strong survived and ten survived and she died. I\u2019m named after her. Sarah was her name. My Bible name is Sarah. So they knew about that, and my mother\u2019s... my dad\u2019s mother, she died... let\u2019s see, there was, the war broke out in \u201839, she died around that time. The war already broke Sylvia Green 115 January 11, 1996 Page 115 out, but it was at the beginning and thank God, the way she died, it was Passover, and she choked on a piece of matzo, and the whole thing was not even a split second. She must have been a hundred. And can you imagine how frightened she would have been in the cattle wagon? So this was really a blessing. So my children did not have a grandmother, because Jake\u2019s mother died when he was nine, and my parents got killed. So that\u2019s why I am a Bubby. \u201cBubby\u2019 is \u2018Grandmother\u2019 in eastern Europe. So, when Sandy was pregnant with Jay, she asked me whether it be all right, she never had a Bubby, whether Jay can call me Bubby. The other grandmother did not want to be called Bubby, she wanted to be called Grandmama. I said, \u201cThat\u2019s fine, if he doesn\u2019t call me... if your baby, my grandchild doesn\u2019t call me anything worse, Bubby is fine.\u201d So I\u2019m still Bubby.

And Jerry was a boy scout, he took piano lessons, he was on the Little League and they were busy. And it was good for them, and then both went to work. Jerry went to work at Kroger\u2019s when he was 16, sacking groceries. One time I walk in, Jerry was washing the floor. I said, \u2018Jerry,\u2019 somebody dropped a watermelon. I said, \u201cHow come you don\u2019t do this at Sylvia Green 116 January 11, 1996 Page 116 home?\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t get paid. Here I get paid.\u201d He worked for Kroger\u2019s when he went away to college. Now, he never worked during a week, in high school, just on weekends, because the manager ask him, \u201cI need somebody during the week,\u201d and he said, \u201cMr. Hazelwick, I want to work, but this would defeat the purpose. I want to save money so I can go to college. If I don\u2019t make the grades, then I wouldn\u2019t be accepted.\u201d And he liked his honesty, and he hired him. So when Jerry came home Christmas, and during the summer he worked at Kroger\u2019s till he graduated from college, and he saved enough money up to buy his own car. And Sandy worked at IGA as a checker, and she worked from the time she was 16. And she worked the graveyard shift, till 12 o\u2019clock, Jake was waiting for her.

So, I remember when I came to Lexington, people drove cars, but there were not many cars. And if you were Sylvia Green 122 January 11, 1996 Page 122 driving, they would stop, \u201cGo on, go on.\u201d Now, since I drive myself, they... they try to beat you to the stop light. It\u2019s a lot of change in... it\u2019s kind of overgrown, I think. Look what\u2019s going on in Anita Madden\u2019s... that shopping center she has, the mall. I don\u2019t know, I mean, it\u2019s just overgrown. Whenever they have a new shopping mall, people move out from a different place, and move there. I, I just wonder, how many shopping malls do you need?"

And I don\u2019t know, he seemed to be satisfied, maybe I put the \u2018X\u2019 down there, I don\u2019t know. Ever since then, any kind of legal, took a long time to overcome. Because I remember when I needed a Social Security number, it took Sylvia Green 123 January 11, 1996 Page 123 me three hours to get enough nerve to go in there.

Doesn\u2019t bother me any more now, but I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think I ever missed an occasion, not to vote."

And, but he did moonlight... he has a beautiful voice, cantorial voice. When I came back, when I buried him in Paramus, New Jersey, and I told you I locked myself in the house for two days and two nights and cried, I played the tape over and over, I must have over ten times, and I said, \u201cYou going crazy, you better quit. If not, you\u2019re going to wear out the tape and you\u2019re not going to have any tape.\u201d So, he had a strong, beautiful voice, and he did moonlight sometimes. Like on Passover, he would go in New York, oh what was that place? It was a hotel and they served food and ceremony... Grossinger. You heard of Grossinger, did you? No?"

So when his daughter, Sharon, picked me up at the airport, I said, \u201cCould we stop by?\u201d It was about eight o\u2019clock. She said, \u201cSure.\u201d So we stopped by, and the kids bought him a Lazy Boy, and he was asleep, and I walked in, and he was hard of hearing, too, and he couldn\u2019t... the hearing aids, he lost them and lost them and then they didn\u2019t help any, anyway. So I whispered in his ear, \u201cBernard, Bernard, you lazy boy, wake up. Your sister Sylvia is here.\u201d About three or four time, I repeated that, and all in a sudden, you should have seen his face. Before, he was pale, flushed, his eyes, there was recognition, and a smile from ear to ear. And Sharon said, \u201cYou know something? I haven\u2019t seen Daddy smile like that since Mama died.\u201d But that was the only recognition, then I was \u201cHey you,\u201d or \u201cI want to do this, I want to do that.\u201d And when Sharon... before we went to the airport, I... this time I stayed two days, because it Just wore me out, just fly in and fly out Sunday. So I, I flew in Thursday, and I was just... because before, I stayed with him all day, and she picked me up just to go to bed at her house. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s getting too hard for you, and you just stay a half a day,\u201d but I stayed all day Friday, I stayed all day Saturday, and before we went to the airport, I said, \u201cDo you think you could, we could stop by?\u201d She said, \u201cSure. We can leave about an hour earlier, and you can stay with him.\u201d So, when I walked in, he said... the day before, we thought he was going to die. Sylvia Green 136 January 11, 1996 Page 136 Walked in there, \u201cI want to get dressed.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, you going to get dressed.\u201d I took some clothes and I matched up things. He looked sharp, he really did. And I was going to shave him, but his electric shaver didn\u2019t work, and I wouldn\u2019t use a straight razor, he was a severe diabetic. But I combed his hair, I washed his face. He said, \u201cI want to eat in the dining room.\u201d He hasn\u2019t eaten in the dining room, I don\u2019t remember when. I took him to the dining room in a wheelchair, and sat down next to him. And they wouldn\u2019t give him any bread any more, because he would wad it up, put it in his mouth, and he\u2019d choke. So he saw the bread and he pointed, and his face lit up. So I broke it up in a million little pieces. And then he ate, and I kissed him good-bye. It didn\u2019t bother him that I left, he didn\u2019t know. But I\u2019m just happy I saw him two months before, and this... to recognize him, that he recognized me, this is something I cherish. But he left three beautiful girls. Nice son-in-laws. Good girls. One is going to make Aliyah, she\u2019s moving to Israel."

She was from Germany, and maybe a hundred miles away from my hometown, she was... she\u2019s, was from Mannheim. And some relatives of Jake wanted me to meet her, they thought that she was such a lovely lady, and she probably was, but I didn\u2019t want to meet her, because with the German connection. And for years I didn\u2019t meet her. If I saw her, I would run across the street, just not to have to see her. So then, finally, we did meet and we talked some, and I always said, \u201cShe seems nice enough, she couldn\u2019t be my best friend.\u201d And I don\u2019t know whether I would want her as my best friend, because then it\u2019s German again, you know. But I was at Kroger\u2019s, oh it was, I don\u2019t know, November, December, and we were talking about something and it came up, the past, and she starts sobbing and she start crying, and automatically, I cradled her in my arms. I couldn\u2019t believe it, I mean, that was such a automatic gesture, you know. I just couldn\u2019t believe it. So when I came home, I called Sandy. I said, \u201cYou won\u2019t believe it. I was comforting Lilo Thomps... Thompson.\u201d She said, \u201cMom, you\u2019ve come a long ways.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I Sylvia Green 139 January 11, 1996 Page 139 have.\u201d But I did tell her also, I said, \u201cListen, we were born at the wrong time, at the wrong place.\u201d Now, I couldn\u2019t have felt that way a few years back, and it\u2019s true."

So I called Jerry, then I called Sandy, Sandy said, \u201cHang up, I call right back and leave the line open.\u201d So I did, so she heard everything what went on. So, I was so fortunate that night, because my doctor, Dr. Sylvia Green 140 January 11, 1996 Page 140 Pika was on call that night, and she was called in, and she stayed with me. And Sandy called a friend to stay in the hospital with me. And so Dr. Pika told that friend, Ava Tyler, \u201cMiss Tyler,\u201d she didn\u2019t know Ava, \u201cI like to ask a favor of you, would you please spend the night with Mrs. Green? I don\u2019t want her alone.\u201d So, I\u2019m very fortunate to have a caring doctor like she is. And she\u2019s only about 32-33 years old, with two children. She had those while she already was, was in practice. So, she prepared me so, because they were working at, with Jake at the hospital, in emergency room. And she would come back and forth, to see how I was. And after about a half an hour, she said, \u201cMiss Green, you don\u2019t want him back. If he would come back now, he\u2019d be brain-dead and you wouldn\u2019t want him, he wouldn\u2019t want it.\u201d I think he already was gone when she came in telling me that."
