So my mother had to raise all the younger children so she never had a childhood. She said she never played with children. They had a cradle made out of wood and she would look out the window and children were on the sidewalk playing hopscotch and she participated then, she was in an apartment upstairs and many times the cradle was turned upside down because she got so excited, but she never had time to really play with children, raising the rest of the family. My grandfather, I only saw him once or twice in my life. To me, he was a big man with a long beard, Orthodox, and my mother said that he never held any of the children on his lap, but the grandchildren he did. That one time we went to visit, I was on his lap and I braided his beard and my mother just stood there, she didn\u2122t believe that he let me do that."

My dad wanted him to be a rabbi, is that all right the way I\u2122m holding that now? My dad wanted hi m to be a rabbi, my mother wanted him to be a college professor, so he was educated for both. So I was schooled, we had school, you went to school from eight till 12 and you went back in the afternoon from two till four, or from eight till one and three till five. Whenever he got out of school, he had to go to Hebrew Sylvia Green 6 January 11, 1996 Page 6 school, every day. So he didn\u2122t have much of a childhood either. And it was really interesting, after we met again after the war, he was married and I was married and so we talked about our parents and about our childhood, and the interesting part was the way I talked about our parents was not the same way he talked about his parents, which were our parents, you know. So he told me, he said, \ufb01I was so jealous of you.\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01Why?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I was so jealous of you, you were so brilliant.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01I had to be. I had to study all the time, I had no childhood and you had friends.\ufb02 He didn\u2122t have any friends. \ufb01You always had friends, you always were playing or going places, doing things.\ufb02 And it was really interesting, we were jealous of each other.

And it\u2122s really interesting you asking that, I still remember Fritz \u00d6ler, we were raised together and I loved Fritz as much as I liked my brother, loved my brother Bernard. And then when Hitler came to power, he disappeared. If we passed on the street, he wouldn\u2122t see me. If I passed on the str eet when it was dark, at that time we used to go out in the evening, at the beginning, later on we didn\u2122t go out too much in the evenings, he would look, stare at you like no recognition, but then he would take his hand and wave at you in the back, so he wouldn\u2122t been seen. So but that really hurt, because in a way I knew that the reason for it because I was a Jew, but it\u2122s very hard for children to accept. You, you take it personally. Because I would cry, I came home and I saw some of the girls I used to play with and they run away. \ufb01Why doesn\u2122t she like me any more? I haven\u2122t done anything to her.\ufb02 That\u2122s hard. And they probably went home and talked to their parents, also, how bad they felt, you know."

And then, but by the time we were sent back to Plaszow, we did not work in Kabelwerk any more. This was September, \u201a43. And when I got there, we ll, we had to work in the concentration camp, we had to open graves, pull out gold teeth and the people who were in charge of this place were prisoners, German prisoners and they were completely out of control. I mean they were murderers, they were in prison because they were murderers from way before the war and they let them out to, to oversee us. A nd the guy\u2122s name, Hermann [ph], oh wow, he was crazy, he really was crazy. I saw Goeth many tim es and as soon as we heard he was walking in the camp, I was running away because we knew he was target shooting, he didn\u2122t care what you looked like, he was just target shooting, he wanted to see how close he could shoot or how far he could shoot. And Schindler was with him many times and they were drinking buddies. And I really don\u2122t think Schindler, well, he saved a lot of Jews and like they say, who saves one life, saves the world, but I can guarantee you this man did not start out to save the Jews. He started out to, to fill his pockets and somehow I think towards the end, he found out that it\u2122s a losing war they\u2122re fighting so he changed his mind. But, thank God he did because he saved a lot of Jews. But this was terrible, I mean in Plaszow, whether we had to go outside and load railroad tracks again or in, if we worked inside, then we had to dig, I mean open the graves and pull out the gold teeth or we carried barracks, they were always Sylvia Green 33 January 11, 1996 Page 33 building barracks and we had to, to carry that stuff. And really my legs are my weakest, my, my health problem, are my legs. You can\u2122t work like a dog, like a man, and not come out scarred. So we were there until, oh, I didn\u2122t tell you about my cousin, Janek Haubenstock. When we came back in September \u201a43, people we re telling me about my cousin, Janek. He and a little boy were walking in the concentration camp and, evidently, Goeth was walking towards him and my little cousin Janek had a hab it, he drove his mother crazy, when he was upset he would whistle. He didn\u2122t even know he did this. And somebody told me that he was whistling, that, it was a Russian song or a French anthem, I don\u2122t know, I wasn\u2122t there, and they arrested him right there, in \u201a43, and they built a gallow to hang him, all night long, and the next day they brought him out to hang him, they made his father sit in the front row, my uncle, Henek Haubenstock, and the rope broke . So he sent somebody for a new rope and my poor little cousin, must have been just scared to death, and he was crawling up to Goeth\u2122s foot and kissing his boot. And they said that he was just hissing, Goeth took the gun out and shot him right there. My uncle saw it and he had a complete stroke, never came back from it because when I went up there, I went to see him in Plaszow, in that concentration camp where it all happened, he was just a vegetable."

Somebody had, had to survive to tell the world, we did not know that the world knew about it. We thought everybody was just ignorant about it, you know, they did not know. And I don\u2122t know, don\u2122t ask me whether, people say you must have been very healthy. I wasn\u2122t any healthier than the ones who died next to me because I had typhus, for two weeks I don\u2122t remember anything. I was so sick and we had to stand appell and they would drag me out, which I did not know, and they stood me up, holding me up. The only thing I can think of is, my time was not up. Somebody still had some purpose a nd also, I don\u2122t know, maybe it was a strong will to live, to tell the world. But my world crumbled pretty quick after I came to the United States, when I found out the world did know and didn\u2122t do a thing about it.

And I\u2122ve s till got a lot of why\u2122s, thank God I got over the bitterness. The bitterness doesn\u2122t work, it eats you up alive and it, it doesn\u2122t harm the people you hate. It, I couldn\u2122t even talk German after the war, a complete blank. I blocked it out. And my brother told me, \ufb01Sylvia,\ufb02 he said, \ufb01the German language is beautiful.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01The German language? I connect it with Hitler, it\u2122s not beautiful, it\u2122s terrible.\ufb02 And then to meet people who had anything to do with Germany or German descent, I had to run away. And this kind man helped, he was so ki nd, because I just wanted to shut the door and that\u2122s it, not think about it and when I got marri ed, and even after, I was an atheist, I didn\u2122t believe in anything, I really didn\u2122t. And so after I got married, I still did not talk about it to anybody. It was like I was ashamed of it, like some of it was my fa ult, you know. And I knew it wasn\u2122t, but somehow I just couldn\u2122t talk about it and then it was a small town with not many Jewish people, I already had one monke y on my head to be a Jew in a small town, and, but the door would not stay shut when I got pregnant. And then it all came back, the nightmares and waking up screaming, not waking up, excuse me, screaming in my dreams. Sobbing wet, Jake would wake me up, and we w ould come in and we sit for hours and I had Sylvia Green 36 January 11, 1996 Page 36 to start talking and this man sat next to me, I don\u2122t know whether he listened what I said or what, but his ear was there and that\u2122s what I needed. So I was pretty lucky to have a wonderful husband and the children are great, they really are. They\u2122re loving, very loving. I said that in the documentary, I did not want to raise them full of hatred. In fact, they didn\u2122t know much about the Holocaust till I made that doc umentary. I want them to, want to raise them healthy, happy and, physically and mentally, and they got problems, I mean everybody\u2122s got problems, but the problems are not connected with my past. Because I did set myself a goal that if I fail, then Hitler had won out, and he didn\u2122t because they\u2122re loving children, they really are big hearts."

And Krakow, Auschwitz is not that far from Krakow, but it took such a long time because the train stopped every few feet because the planes were bombing. And before we got into the cattle wagon, they gave us some bread and that was all. And there was a container with water, and one container for the bathroom. And they stopped and gosh, were we pray, praying. Yeah, they jumped out of the, the trains, and they were hiding in ditches, the German, and we were laughing, we really were laughing.

They couldn\u2122t get any orders, they didn\u2122t know whether we end up in the, should end up in the gas chamber or at the camp. And we just sat. And it was cold, it was January. And finally there still were no orders, but then we took, I guess they were afraid to send us to the ovens, if the orders came that we should not been killed, they couldn\u2122t bring us back after they once gassed us, you know. So then they told us to go in to showers and we took the shower, naturally there\u2122s never enough water.

And when we got to, I think it was still January of \u201a44, because we were pretty much one of the first ones there. When we came to Bergen-Belsen, they had nothing but tents and then there was a big storm one night and it was quiet, there was no shouting and it was very quiet in comparison to Auschwitz, there was so much commotion constantly. It was ve ry quiet and my aunt said, \ufb01You know, Sylvia, in comparison to Auschwitz, this is a vaca tion.\ufb02 But we didn\u2122t know that was\u2013it was no gas chambers, but it was a starvation camp. They just starved you to death. So there weren\u2122t that many people, but then we had a big st orm and it knocked all the tents down and they moved us to barracks. And they were l ooking for somebody who spoke a lot of languages, so I applied for it. I spoke German fluently, by that time already, I spoke Polish fluently, but couldn\u2122t read or write it because when you\u2122re young you pick up languages, they said I spoke it with a heavy accent. So I applied for it and I knew about three words of French, or maybe five words, and two words of Russia n, so I got the job, not very long, though, but enough that I had a foot in the kitchen. And so I could steal food so my aunt wouldn\u2122t be hungry. So there were Jewish people working in the kitchen and some Russian soldiers working in the kitchen, and there were three Frenchmen. They were college students and Sylvia Green 40 January 11, 1996 Page 40 they worked with the underground, Gentiles, and they got caught. So they were funny, they were so funny. They all spoke German and w ouldn\u2122t let the German know that they spoke German. And they would sing, and they woul d sing the French anthem, and they would laugh and they made us laugh. But the Russian people, we had to stay away from \u201aem. When when we stole food, we didn\u2122t tell on each other, but the Russians told on us when they saw us stealing food. They kept to themselv es pretty much, we were afraid of \u201aem. So, well, I got typhus in the, back in Belsen, and Paul Lepitre, one of the Frenchmen, stole food and sent it to the camp, so by the time I got the food, there wasn\u2122t that much food left because she shared it with other people, but evidently it must have helped some. And when I got better after two weeks, I noticed that I didn\u2122t have any shoes, I don\u2122t know what happened to \u201aem, my shoes, and I told the girl, I said, \ufb01I can\u2122t go back to work in the kitchen without shoes.\ufb02 So Paul Lepitre stole some man\u2122s boots and sent it to the camp with a friend of mine. And after I went b ack to the kitchen, those three Frenchmen hoisted me up on their shoulder and they were marching and they were singing La, what is it, La Marseillaise, the French anthem. Ach, the German, I\u2122m telling you, they would get so red and yell and we\u2122d say, \ufb01You\u2122re going to have a stroke, he\u2122s going to have a stroke.\ufb02 But no, not such luck. And we were liberated April the 14th \u2013"

It was really strange, by that time I wasn\u2122t working in the kitchen any more, nobody was working anywheres because there was no food and they already knew that they Sylvia Green 41 January 11, 1996 Page 41 were in bad shape because the guards were disappearing there and they came back, there was no place for \u201aem to go. We didn\u2122t know that, they were surrounded by the Russians, by the British and by the Americans, and there was no place to run around, so they were digging ditches. And oh, they were angry, I\u2122m telli ng you, you couldn\u2122t even set a foot out, if not, you got shot. So we stayed pretty mu ch indoors and everybody was sick, no energy, no water, no food and then I got dysentery problems again. I went out one night to relieve myself and I felt something cold I was sitti ng on and I looked, it was a body and I just moved over. I mean, you got, evidently, you got conditioned to that. I mean, just thinking about it, it blows my mind, you know. And I crawled back in. So one night, it was between 14th and 15th, the night, or was early in the morning, we heard a lot of tanks rolling and rolling and rolling, we didn\u2122t know what was the matte r. And it was morning and somebody came running in, \ufb01We are liberated! We are liberated !\ufb02 And they said, \ufb01By the British Army, we are liberated!\ufb02 Well, I crawled out there and my aunt went out there, too. I said, \ufb01What are you talking about?\ufb02 The German commanders, they were standing in front of the tanks, they tied them down evidently, I don\u2122t know. And they, with no medals, they stripped them of all the medals, but I didn\u2122t see that. I still saw th e Nazis, I said, \ufb01What you talking about? Here they are.\ufb02 And then we found out we were liberated, and I stood up, then I start singing the British anthem, God Bless the King, I remember ed that from school. And, ah, there was such, so much commotion going on. They were so wonderful. And they gave us care packages, we didn\u2122t know how to handle those care packages, we ate everything! And that\u2122s Sylvia Green 42 January 11, 1996 Page 42 why so many died, on that starvation diet fo r so many years and then you drank cocoa, I mean the powder, and coffee, you smoked cigarette s, chocolate, all at one time and sardines. They meant well, I mean they didn\u2122t mean any harm. But I think that the world learned from that, whenever prisoners come back, they kind of condition them slowly with food."

They didn\u2122t tell us about it, we would Sylvia Green 51 January 11, 1996 Page 51 have been scared to death.

From Karlsruhe?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Yes.\ufb02 And she said, \ufb01I don\u2122t know, do you remember Berndt Weissman?\ufb02 I said, Sylvia Green 52 January 11, 1996 Page 52 \ufb01Yeah, I went to school with him, the, the Je wish school.\ufb02 He had a speech defect and the children were not very kind to him and children can be cruel.

And he was such a ni ce boy but the kids just didn\u2122t give him a chance, he was very intelligent, his father was a doctor, I don\u2122t know what happened to him, lost contact. So while we were talking, my cousin came with other cousins. The other cousins, but I didn\u2122t know the other cousins, they were waiting for that one cousin, he had to sign for us. And he came and he looked like a Farber, he looked like my dad, he looked like my brother and we just start hugging and kissi ng, you know.

So they really were wonderful people and they treated me better than the daughter, the daught er said. Because I was older than their daughter, five and a half years, and I could stay out longer on a date. And she resented that. She said, \ufb01They love you more than they love me .\ufb02 They really were great people. But we didn\u2122t stay very long. My brother came in September and we rented an apartment and we lived on my brother\u2122s Army pay, ninety dollars a month, forty-five dollars rent. Water bill was cheap, two dollars, electric bill and we ma de it, can you imagine? And we only had hamburger on Sundays. But we wanted to be i ndependent, Urbachs didn\u2122t want us to leave, but we wanted to get started. So my brothe r start teaching languages, he, he was working on Sylvia Green 54 January 11, 1996 Page 54 his undergraduate degree and he was tutoring in French and German and sometimes he didn\u2122t go to bed until two, three o\u2122clock in the morning because he had to do his own homework.

So I remember Joe Wile said to me, \ufb01What are you doing on the floor?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I\u2122m not st upid, I can do better than that, just wrap packages.\ufb02 And, well, normally a clerk couldn\u2122t have said that, but then, I didn\u2122t have the clothes I was supposed to wear, supposed to wear dark clothes, navy blue or gray or black. I didn\u2122t have it, he told me, \ufb01You wear what you got.\ufb02 So he really made, made allowances for me. In fact, people must have talked about this\u0160a Holocaust survivor\u0160and another department store, Martin, the buyer, I don\u2122t re member, I don\u2122t think she came in to Wolf Wile\u2122s, she must have waited outdoors or something, she came up to me and she said, \ufb01I really would like for you to work for Martin\u2122s.

The factories where I applied in Lexington wouldn\u2122t hire me because I couldn\u2122t speak English fluently. Now, you could sue \u201aem because you discriminated, but at that time you didn\u2122t know about suing people. So I told him, I said, \ufb01Listen, they approached me at Martin\u2122s and they would pay me twenty-five dollars a week.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Well, if Martin\u2122s can pay you twenty-five, I can give you twenty-five.\ufb02 I did feel guilty because the people I worked with, some been working there ten, 20 years and didn\u2122t make more than twenty-five or twenty-seven dollars, but I told him, I said, \ufb01You know, we need the money.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01I know.\ufb02 So people in Sylvia Green 57 January 11, 1996 Page 57 Lexington were very nice, very decent."

It was eight-twenty, eight-thirty, quarter to nine, no Jake Green. I got undressed, I put my slack suit back on, I was madder than a hornet. I wasn\u2122t used to be stood up.

It\u2122s like a cul-de-sac, you know, it\u2122s a circle. So that\u2122s how I met my husband and we went out dancing and I don\u2122t know, the evening passed by so fast and I ask him now, I said, \ufb01How could you understand me, I couldn\u2122t even understand myself.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01It was very easy.\ufb02 I learned a little Jewish, Yiddish and he knew a little Yiddish and some German and some English, we had a marvelous time and we both like to dance. And we dated about a year and a half and we got married January the 16 th, 1949, which is going to be 47 years, a long time. My brother said, \ufb01It won\u2122t last.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Why?\ufb02 He had not hing against Jake, he just said, \ufb01Nobody could live with you any longer ten days to three weeks.\ufb02 "

I said, \ufb01What you talking about?\ufb02 I didn\u2122t even see the British. All I saw is that, \ufb01There are the Germans, don\u2122t you see \u201aem?\ufb02 Then somebody said, \ufb01No medals, look.\ufb02 And I stood up, and it is amazing that I had the energy to stand up, before\u2013 because we had no food. We couldn\u2122t even venture out the barracks, because if they saw somebody venturing out, you just took your life into your hand. They were digging ditches, they were going to blow up the camp. And, really all\u2013 we all were in a semi-conscious state. And I remember I crawled out, I did not walk out. I Sylvia Green 65 January 11, 1996 Page 65 crawled on all four. And somehow, I had the energy, I don\u2122t know where it came from, I stood up, and I sang God\u2013 well, the British anthem, \ufb01God Save the King.\ufb02 I learned that in school. So, they were wonderful. I think the first thing they did, they took us to delousing. This camp was just completely diseased. It was typhus and lice and any kind of disease you want was found in there. And so many piled up that\u2122s all\u2013 the, the, the ones that died. And so they took us to delousing, and they gave us clean clothes. And delousing usually was, with the German, too, you left your\u2013 you went in through one door, you, you, you walked in the nude in the shower, and then, after you came out, and they sprayed you. So then they gave us a box of food. And it was like a ration. And I remember I ate everything in sight. I did not know what instant coffee was, and powdered milk, and sardines and cigarettes, and chocolate. That whole thing was consumed in the, in the few minutes."

And when they liquidated the ghetto, March the 13 th, 1943, my first cousin, he was still alive at that time, was in the clean up crew, where they cleaned up the bodies, loaded it on trucks, and he told me that my dad was laying on the sidewalk, in the nude.

He wrote him, \ufb01I don\u2122t want to go to your home. Let\u2122s just meet at the neutral place, in the park, or the depot, just somewheres.\ufb02 Because, too many hard feelings there. And they met, and Fritzle was happy, Bernard, he\u2013 Bernard wanted to make his peace with Karlsruhe. So Fritzle was talking and Bernard was talking, and Fritzle said that his Sylvia Green 76 January 11, 1996 Page 76 parents were still alive. Bernard jumped up, and walked away, didn\u2122t say good-bye or anything. He came back to the United States, Sarah my sister-in-law told me, he walked into his home, went to the telephone, calling me, \ufb01There is no justice, there is no justice.\ufb02 Fritz \u00d6ler \u2013 Fritz was like a brother, really. We were raised together, and my mother and Frau \u00d6ler were close friends. And then, when Hitler came to power, her husband became a big wheel in the SS. And I was scared of the man. I don\u2122t know, I\u2013 how can you be that close, and then all in a sudden looking at you like, \ufb01I\u2122m going to come at you and kill you?\ufb02 And I got the picture of\u2013 well, that\u2122s, the picture wouldn\u2122t help you, and I got\u2013 here. It\u2122s right in the front. Oh-oh. That\u2122s Fritzle. That\u2122s me."

I audited some classes at the University Kentucky, I think it was two or three times in the morning, from eight till nine.

And she always said, \ufb01I have a cousin, a first cousin.\ufb02 Jake and Martha were more like brothers and sisters, because when Jake\u2122s mother died, Jake went to live with Martha and her parents, so he could say special prayers in the synagogue. It\u2122s called kaddish and you need ten men, at that time. Now women count, too. And so, they felt more like brothers and sisters. And I told her, I said, \ufb01Well, I\u2122m going with that fellow in New York.\ufb02 And she was just after me and after me, so George and I had an understanding that we were going to date other people, since we were that far apart, to learn about the American way. And, so the first night we went out, he took me dancing, we had a marvelous time. I always said, \ufb01How could you understand me?\ufb02 We spoke... spoke some German, some little Yiddish, sounds like German, he understood Yiddish. And then English. He said he understood me very well. So, it was September \u201a47, and we married January the 16 th, \u201a49."

I don\u2122t think so. But after we were married, we wanted children pretty soon, because he was 34, I was 24, and when I got pregnant with Jerry, that was when the nightmares started. And he would come with dry, clean pajamas and a towel, and he sponged me off with a washcloth. He changed the sheets, it just went through. The nightmare was the German came to take my baby away and kill it, because I saw many babies killed and they did not use bullets, they just threw them against the wall, because they couldn\u2122t waste bullets. So, that\u2122s when we talked, usually after I got... he got me all dried off and everything, we would sit on the couch in the living room, and many nights we never went back to sleep, and he didn\u2122t either. And all the time I lived with that man, he never complained. He didn\u2122t let me sleep, because it was even later on at times, I needed to talk. His ear was always there.

We never were less than 14, sometimes 20 people, sometimes 11 people. So what else could I have done? I mean, you come to a point that they have to do it themselves. And I thought they had enough background. Sandy later belonged to a Conservative synagogue, but they only go on High Holidays and I think a lot... the rabbi has a lot to do with it. They had the rabbi, that\u2122s why they joined it, he was wonderful. He was great with young people. They... they went all the time, but this one, he\u2122s such a bore. The first time I went down there, and they were walking around... I don\u2122t know, have you ever... were you ever at services, Jewish services, when they walk around with the Torah, and you kiss the Torah?

I\u2122m the only old woman who was Bat Mitzvah, and I don\u2122t know whether I did it as much out of religion, as I was\u2013 I think I was jealous of my brother, as a child. All that attention and all the gifts. And here, I knew every speech, I knew his Torah reading, I knew his Haftorah reading, I knew his speech by heart, as well as he did. And they made such a big deal over him. So, I don\u2122t know, in my speech 11 years ago, I said, \ufb01You probably are asking why I\u2122m doing this now. I raised my children in a kosher home, in the Jewish religion, to the best I could. I don\u2122t know whether that has anything to do with the religion, I am Bat Mitzvah, or it was jealousy. I had to prove to myself I could do it.\ufb02 That was my speech. And I said, \ufb01I doed it.\ufb02 But, it was a lucky thing, because it helped me a lot in... after Jake died. The people are wonderful, they... I\u2122m almost the oldest one there, and they\u2122re all young couples, so I\u2122m a grandmother. And then, after Jake died, they came for a whole week here, just saying prayers. And you only need ten people to say prayers. Now women count, too, men and women. Sometimes we had up to 30 here, because they wanted to come. And if I don\u2122t go on a Saturday, I miss it. I go every Saturday, even we had the little bit of snow, and they got mad at me after I walked in. \ufb01I thought you wouldn\u2122t be here, maybe you shouldn\u2122t be out.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Well, it\u2122s supposed to have melted by the time I drove home.\ufb02 But I miss it, and I feel like this is my family. And in fact, I think I told you, last Saturday, they Sylvia Green 114 January 11, 1996 Page 114 called me up to say a special prayer, before you read the Torah, or was it between you read the Torah, and I cried, I couldn\u2122t help it. And, so the one who read the Torah raf, he said, \ufb01What\u2122s the matter, Sylvia?\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01I feel so alone.\ufb02 Yeah, they were wishing me a happy birthday and clapping, and in Hebrew, congratulations, you know. And so, I don\u2122t know, I just looked around, there was no... I mean, there were people there, but I was alone. And I told the Torahfa, he said, \ufb01What are you talking about? We are your family.\ufb02 That was sweet. And it helped."

The war already broke Sylvia Green 115 January 11, 1996 Page 115 out, but it was at the beginning and thank God, the way she died, it was Passover, and she choked on a piece of matzo, and the whole thing was not even a split second. She must have been a hundred. And can you imagine how frightened she would have been in the cattle wagon? So this was really a blessing. So my children did not have a grandmother, because Jake\u2122s mother died when he was nine, and my parents got killed. So that\u2122s why I am a Bubby. \u201aBubby\u2122 is \u201aGrandmother\u2122 in eastern Europe. So, when Sandy was pregnant with Jay, she asked me whether it be all right, she never had a Bubby, whether Jay can call me Bubby. The other grandmother did not want to be called Bubby, she wanted to be called Grandmama. I said, \ufb01That\u2122s fine, if he doesn\u2122t call me\u2013 if your baby, my grandchild doesn\u2122t call me anything worse, Bubby is fine.\ufb02 So I\u2122m still Bubby.

He heard that in Kentucky people don\u2122t wear shoes, and they don\u2122t have many Jews, and he wanted to see it with his own eyes, and\u2013 and to take me back to New York. I thought it was very thoughtful, and very sweet, just the cousin who I met, you know.

He had a date, which he took to Atlantic City for a weekend, that was all right, wasn\u2122t it? But not his sister. So this was the only object\u2013 objection I had to him."

All Bernard knew, Bernard never had a childhood. He was studying, and they tore him apart, because my dad wanted him to be a rabbi, my mother wanted him to be a college professor. He had to bring home all A\u2122s. So poor Bernard just studied all the time. He never could have made it. He couldn\u2122t have made it in any of the camps. So, no, I wasn\u2122t angry about that, I\u2013 in fact, after we survived, Mina and I talked a lot about that, how lucky, because he would have been one of the first ones. And we were lucky that they sent him instead, the Jewish Welfare Office. He did not go with the kindertransport, but they send him somewheres else.

If not, you\u2122re going to wear out the tape and you\u2122re not going to have any tape.\ufb02 So, he had a strong, beautiful voice, and he did moonlight sometimes.

She said, \ufb01Sure.\ufb02 So we stopped by, and the kids bought him a Lazy Boy, and he was asleep, and I walked in, and he was hard of hearing, too, and he couldn\u2122t\u2013 the hearing aids, he lost them and lost them and then they didn\u2122t help any, anyway. So I whispered in his ear, \ufb01Bernard, Bernard, you lazy boy, wake up. Your sister Sylvia is here.\ufb02 About three or four time, I repeated that, and all in a sudden, you should have seen his face. Before, he was pale, flushed, his eyes, there was recognition, and a smile from ear to ear. And Sharon said, \ufb01You know something? I haven\u2122t seen Daddy smile like that since Mama died.\ufb02 But that was the only recognition, then I was \ufb01Hey you,\ufb02 or \ufb01I want to do this, I want to do that.\ufb02 And when Sharon\u2013 before we went to the airport, I\u2013 this time I stayed two days, because it just wore me out, just fly in and fly out Sunday. So I, I flew in Thursday, and I was just\u2013 because before, I stayed with him all day, and she picked me up just to go to bed at her house. She said, \ufb01It\u2122s getting too hard for you, and you just stay a half a day,\ufb02 but I stayed all day Friday, I stayed all day Saturday, and before we went to the airport, I said, \ufb01Do you think you could, we could stop by?\ufb02 She said, \ufb01Sure. We can leave about an hour earlier, and you can stay with him.\ufb02 So, when I walked in, he said\u2013 the day before, we thought he was going to die. Sylvia Green 136 January 11, 1996 Page 136 Walked in there, \ufb01I want to get dressed.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Okay, you going to get dressed.\ufb02 I took some clothes and I matched up things. He looked sharp, he really did. And I was going to shave him, but his electric shaver didn\u2122t work, and I wouldn\u2122t use a straight razor, he was a severe diabetic. But I combed his hair, I washed his face. He said, \ufb01I want to eat in the dining room.\ufb02 He hasn\u2122t eaten in the dining room, I don\u2122t remember when. I took him to the dining room in a wheelchair, and sat down next to him. And they wouldn\u2122t give him any bread any more, because he would wad it up, put it in his mouth, and he\u2122d choke. So he saw the bread and he pointed, and his face lit up. So I broke it up in a million little pieces. And then he ate, and I kissed him good-bye. It didn\u2122t bother him that I left, he didn\u2122t know. But I\u2122m just happy I saw him two months before, and this\u2013 to recognize him, that he recognized me, this is something I cherish. But he left three beautiful girls. Nice son-in-laws. Good girls. One is going to make Aliyah, she\u2122s moving to Israel."

I get there by\u2013 well, I used to at eight o\u2122clock, but Sylvia Green 144 January 11, 1996 Page 144 then, there\u2122s so much traffic on Boone Avenue when school is in session, if I try to get out here ten to eight, to be in the hospital at eight, I can sit 20 minutes and can\u2122t even get out my driveway. So it\u2122s worthwhile for me to get up a half an hour earlier and leave here about 7:30. But then, we have other things. We have bake sales, we have book sales. And in the morning, I\u2013 what I do is like a gopher. Anything they ask, we, we do. And then, the afternoon, I go to the gift shop, because in the morning it\u2122s a lot of running around. And my legs don\u2122t take it as well, so when I get in the gift shop, then it\u2122s more relaxing, except when we have Beanie Babies, then it\u2122s not very relaxing. There\u2122s\u2013 people still go wild over the Beanie Babies."

            "answer": "Well, take somebody else\u2122s place. Like somebody goes out of town, like I was out of town Monday, so somebody fills in what I do. So, if they go out of town, then I fill in what they do. And then, the only bad thing is that I don\u2122t drive at night, because we really got a lot going on in the synagogue, but it\u2122s always at night. And I have that horror getting stuck on Interstate 64, with a flat tire, or the car stops. So, I do have a car phone, I\u2013 I don\u2122t know, it just\u2013 it\u2122d be scary. So I don\u2122t go after dark. I do in town, I drive. Sylvia Green 145 January 11, 1996 Page 145 I\u2122m a member of AARP, and we meet in the evening."
