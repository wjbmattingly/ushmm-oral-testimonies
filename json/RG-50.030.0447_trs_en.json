My, then there was no money for soldiers\u2122 wives and so on and my fa mily wasn\u2122t rich so Mother had to work. And she went to work at a very unusual way. She worked for, as an, importer for a fi rm that reproduced wooden barrels. And she went all over to buy th e right wood, I don\u2122t know any more and I never knew and never will know what kind of wo od it was. But she was very good at that and when my father came home in 1918, I was five years old. I hardly recognized him. I told my mother, \ufb01There\u2122s a strange man out there, would you go look for hi m?\ufb02 Then I knew it was Father. During the war he occasionally came and brought food because food was very, ve ry rare in Vienna. I ha ve very bad memories as far as food goes that Mother and I, we were standing in line for a long time. I\u2122ve, now, if, I try to remember, it seems it was the whole night in order to get some food ration that, that was supposed to come to us and when we got there, was sometimes there was no fo od left and sometimes, once at least, I remember when we came home, there were potatoes and th ey were all spoiled and Mother cried. So I was then maybe three years old. Occasi onally, we went to my gr andparents. They had a farm in, in Silesia, no, in, in [talkover], no, Moravia . . ."

So I must have been very little and probably very light also. So when the war was over my father came home. He was a mechanical engineer and there was no job 2 for him to get so he worked as a ditch digger and in a factory as this and in a factory as that until the situation had settled. "

If your ch ild is supposed to be home at one thirty, and at th ree or four o\u2122clock, it\u2122s not at home, you wonder. So my father came to sch ool and I recall that the, the priest had kept me and a few other girls in school for a very funny incidenc e. He asked what wa s Christ when he was for 40 days in the, in the desert and there was no food and that was at this time, the time of the people who were called \ufb01hunger artists\ufb02. I don\u2122t th ink you know what that means here. There were people who were going on a hunger strike for so and so long in order to, to show, to prove something. And when , when the priest asked wh at was Christ, one of th e girls said, \ufb01A hunger artist.\ufb02 And then he said, \ufb01Who sa id that?\ufb02 And of cour se, nobody did say so I was one of the ones who were supposed to have said it and three or four others were ther e too.

And all th e time in the prison and on the trip from the prison to Ravensbruck I, I al ways had the feeling it\u2122s not I that\u2122s happening to, somebody else, and I was outsid e just watching what was happe ning. When we came to Ravensbruck I learned, I had to wa ke up. While we were standing there, there were two witnesses of Jehovah coming and they had a big basket in between them. They were walking on the street the so-called Lagerstrasse and a big truck was coming. And the truck would, was going so close that the mirror that a side mirror that he had, hit on e of the women.

So sometimes I think that that woman died so that I can live, okay. __________ Now while I was in Vienna there was a girl there who told, who had come in from Ravens bruck for an inte rview of, at the Gestapo. And she had told me when you come to Ravensbruck I\u2122m sure that\u2122s where you\u2122re going, ask for so and so. She will be able to help you. She is a very tiny dark-haired girl and she has, she is in the, in the receiving line 17 for all the people who come in. And she\u2122ll help you . And this is what I di d and the girl told me, \ufb01I\u2122ll come visit you in the block in the evening,\ufb02 and this is, this is what she did. I stayed at the receiving block who was run by a Vi ennese prostitute. Ever ybody went into this block first. And we stayed there, we, there were the bunks. And every bunk was supposed to hold one person. There, in every bunk were at leas t three. Two this way and one this way. And in the morning when I woke up I noticed that my cloths were missing and I couldn\u2122t go for to a __________ in clothes without shoes so I, I called and th e block, the Blockalteste, the leader, this prostitu te she came and she said to me, \ufb01You are Viennese?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Yes.\ufb02 She said , \ufb01Wait.\ufb02 And a fe w moments later she came with other, with other clothes, not with my own so I was saved for the moment. And for the while, I think for about three or four days we stayed in this bl ock which was horrible because there was really everybody in there. And then we were separated and I went into block number one, the older, not old but some political prisoners were. Rosel Jochman who became a member of Parliament in Austria after the wa r, she was there. Helena Poppt etts(ph) who became also some kind of big wig in the Austrian g overnment after the war, she was there. And I was there and oh I didn\u2122t tell you one story. When I ca me in Vienna into the prison, I had to wait out in the hallway for the little while and for, for the fe w hours, a little while. And then a door was opened and I was pushed into a room. The room wa s, you couldn\u2122t make out anythin g, it was so full of steam, of smell. Everything was kind of hazy and out of this haze somebody came towards me and said, \ufb01Don\u2122t cry, it isn\u2122t so bad.\ufb02 An d this was a former teacher of mi ne. Muti Tiechman was her name. She also had helped Jews and this was, was, wa s the reason why she was arrested. And when I came to Ravensbruck, she already was in Ravensbruc k, also into, also in this number one block. And there we, we kept up very mu ch contact. I was her former p upil, she was my former teacher and somehow a bond was formed. After the war, she adopted Saul whom you met now as her grandson. And she came to visit us in America twice. When we went to Europe we always visited her. Then she died. Now. The number one bl ock, is that all? No."
