It was something like a railroad. And you had a little, like a little choo choo train to drive it. I drove it several times against the wall.

So usually make the remark, the Jewish people usually are very fair and sincere, and they don't want to cheat people out of anything. As a matter of fact, you can rely on a Jewish person because holically (ph) or according to the law it's a sin to cheat. And anybody who's observant is going to respect that. There's another thing, which is very much observed that is in the ten commandments to respect and honor your elders. That's a very important thing in the Jewish law. That's one of the dos instead of do nots. And I think that the almighty was very kind to us. That was when we reach a certain age that we need protection and we need his protection. I think it's wonderful."

I feel, for instance, that I always envied my brother who's younger than me that he's such he's so much better person as a human being than I am. Why not him and why me? Somehow or other I feel guilty about being alive and him not being alive or, for instance, the event that the war was over, and Hitler does not exist anymore so I heard that they committed suicide in their bunker with Eva Braun Brown, right? I asked dear God why did we deserve this? Why did you do this to us? What have we done? I mean I'm not speaking only about our group? It happened in Poland. It was really something. So I don't know. I mean I am asking a lot of questions, but I am asking less and less as the time goes by. I live to see a whole generation of new grandchildren that my two of my granddaughters are married. One of them already have three children. So I have great grandchildren. So maybe there is a purpose in all of these I mean I have three I have a big family again and I came home alone. Alone with my husband, the two of us. It's not alone anymore. But I didn't even know when I was liberated by the Russians that I do have a husband here that took several months to arrive to the particular to that particular moment."

There is nothing they could they could pay me a million, but my mother and father will not rise from their grave. My parents will always be there, and my brother is nonexistent. I've never asked for reparation. I don't want their money. It's very funny. I'm going to have fantastic expenses, and I know that I don't even know if I'm going to survive this ordeal or not, but somehow I feel that I did not leave in vain. And the reparation would make much different. Maybe it would make a great deal of difference for the children. Maybe I should because of them. But for me money has no, no value in that particular thing. I have seen people selling houses, homes, fortunes, yachts for a crust of bread, really. I mean when it comes down to value, what is value? Life is valuable. How you live your life is valuable, but not money. The money is not doesn't somehow or other I am completely nonmaterialistic. Maybe, maybe it's foolish. And I should be a little bit have a little bit more foresight, and the children are going to be burdened with my expenses and whatever. But for myself, I don't want their money."

Why exactly that particular community, 1t was hit so very hard, only God knows. But I'm sure it's not only question of money.
