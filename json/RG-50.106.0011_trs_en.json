For instance for many, many years, many, many people ask, you know, did you tell your children? I said why should I darken their young ears with horror stories such as this? And I never did. It was very difficult for me to even think about these things, nevertheless to talk to my own kids or to my grandchildren. Sometimes my son asked about interesting stories. I said I might have interesting stories, but it's not for the ears of children. Those are horror stories. Those are ghost stories. And I don't want to frighten them."

And after a few minutes we looked back, we didn't see the German soldiers, we saw the bunker flocked down in there. So there was a bombing. The Germans were bombing that Saar region.

And I declare it especially here in the United States when they the people make completely uncalled for remarks, you know, jew you down or, you know, expressions such as that. So usually make the remark, the Jewish people usually are very fair and sincere, and they don't want to cheat people out of anything. As a matter of fact, you can rely on a Jewish person because holically (ph) or according to the law it's a sin to cheat. And anybody who's observant is going to respect that. There's another thing, which is very much observed that is in the ten commandments to respect and honor your elders. That's a very important thing in the Jewish law. That's one of the dos instead of do nots. And I think that the almighty was very kind to us. That was when we reach a certain age that we need protection and we need his protection. I think it's wonderful."

I was 37. She was born in 1960. That is seven years difference between my children. It wasn't my choosing. It just happened so what can I tell a https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection <0 child about my experiences? And then he's going to look at his best friend that he comes over to play football with or hockey or just do homework together.

I feel, for instance, that I always envied my brother who's younger than me that he's such he's so much better person as a human being than I am. Why not him and why me? Somehow or other I feel guilty about being alive and him not being alive or, for instance, the event that the war was over, and Hitler does not exist anymore so I heard that they committed suicide in their bunker with Eva Braun Brown, right? I asked dear God why did we deserve this? Why did you do this to us? What have we done? I mean I'm not speaking only about our group? It happened in Poland. It was really something. So I don't know. I mean I am asking a lot of questions, but I am asking less and less as the time goes by. I live to see a whole generation of new grandchildren that my two of my granddaughters are married. One of them already have three children. So I have great grandchildren. So maybe there is a purpose in all of these I mean I have three I have a big family again and I came home alone. Alone with my husband, the two of us. It's not alone anymore. But I didn't even know when I was liberated by the Russians that I do have a husband here that took several months to arrive to the particular to that particular moment."

There is nothing they could they could pay me a million, but my mother and father will not rise from their grave. My parents will always be there, and my brother is nonexistent. I've never asked for reparation. I don't want their money. It's very funny. I'm going to have fantastic expenses, and I know that I don't even know if I'm going to survive this ordeal or not, but somehow I feel that I did not leave in vain. And the reparation would make much different. Maybe it would make a great deal of difference for the children. Maybe I should because of them. But for me money has no, no value in that particular thing. I have seen people selling houses, homes, fortunes, yachts for a crust of bread, really. I mean when it comes down to value, what is value? Life is valuable. How you live your life is valuable, but not money. The money is not doesn't somehow or other I am completely nonmaterialistic. Maybe, maybe it's foolish. And I should be a little bit have a little bit more foresight, and the children are going to be burdened with my expenses and whatever. But for myself, I don't want their money."

It makes me very proud to see my oldest son sit down with the two youngsters, the two ten year olds, Rosalee's son and his son are about the same age. And he's learning with them half an hour every evening, so he's transferring his knowledge, his doctora with the young children and that's beautiful. To me, it gives a wonderful satisfaction. That's value. To me, that's value. It's not the new outfits, and the new bicycles and pizza shops and God knows what, that's beside the point.

It's a wonderful thing. To me that means a great deal and so did my younger son, not to mention my daughter. They became so religious. He's teaching in a yeshiva, and she's a__ now. And she's very, very respected in the Jewish community in Brooklyn. And, listen, being in Brooklyn you have to be very religious in order to fit in. And she is fitting in.

It couldn't be just a coincidence because I think that in our in the whole world, nothing just happens just by coincidence. Why this happened to us? Why exactly that particular community, 1t was hit so very hard, only God knows. But I'm sure it's not only question of money. We did have some rich people who were able to buy fake papers or went to Switzerland or whatever. Still somehow even they getting a certain tradition with us with them. Don't you think? And they assured us or the survivor of certain amount of people. It's could be it was their own family.
