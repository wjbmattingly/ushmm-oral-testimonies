And I understand that there was a big German aktion in town and that\u2019s when she -- when she was caught in the street and brought to the Umschlagplatz, which was the -- the railroad station, where they took all the people, to send them out.

Where we lived, we went to work at the brush makers, making brushes. And my father and my sister and I, we lived at the Narlefke Street. This was already maybe the third or fourth time that we have moved, since we were thrown out of our own apartment and moved into the ghetto. My father went to work at that particular time and did not return. It seems to have been an aktion and all people from the factory were taken out. So he never returned."

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection who was about three years old, yeah, it must have been \u201842. And my sister and I. And when we heard that the Germans are coming in, we started hiding. Now, my grandmother, my aunt and her little boy, went to a little cabinet underneath the window, which was used instead of -- instead of a refrigerator. And th-the walls of the building were thick, so there was enough room for those people to get in and I closed the door and put a chair in front of it. And my sister didn\u2019t know -- I -- we didn\u2019t know what to do. So we had a folding bed that when it was folded up, it looked like a table. And she crawled in there and I put a -- a cover over it and then I didn\u2019t know what to do, the Germans were already in, so I opened the door to the bathroom, but they looked in the bathroom, too. Then I saw on the -- at the wall -- on the wall of the bathroom, it was a ladder and on top of it was a shelf. There was also a light bulb above the shelf. And I don\u2019t know how I was able to, but I really went up the ladder and sat down on the shelf and unscrewed the bulb, making sure that no-none of my clothes hang down. By that time, I could hear the Germans in the hallway, coming in and my heart was banging so hard I hoped they didn\u2019t hear it. And that\u2019s when they found my sister, and they took her out. At that time they didn\u2019t find my grandmother, my aunt or my little cousin. But they did find my sister. Some people told me afterwards, some neighbors, that she was shot. I cannot recall -- I was in such shock, that I don\u2019t remember what I heard and what I saw. I just remembered that I heard her cry and they took her out. They found her in the bed."

And my uncle, at that time, tried to -- to contact some friends who worked with the police -- with the Jewish police. But, before anything could happen, we got word that the trains left. So, we know that she was caught there and that she was there. And of course, the trains left to Treblinka, that\u2019s what we were advised. When my father didn\u2019t come back, we did not hear anything, except that there was the aktion in the factory and the people were taken out. And this was, oh, I would estimate maybe two months or three months after my mother, because I remember the weather was windy. I really had to judge everything by the weather. I had no knowledge of dates. There was no calendar to look at. And I think that I was too young or inexperienced to -- to really remember dates. Life there was like life of a rat that is hiding and it\u2019s constantly chased. And one does not know exactly where and when it 1s, day, night, summer, winter.

But the dates -- exact dates are not known to me. Later on, when I listened to some people, who were a little bit older, even three, four years older than I am, they knew dates.

I know that the thought that was the most important, was survival and probably I -- probably I thought, \u201cHow can I survive without them?\u201d It was actually a -- a selfish feeling, probably.

Went to agent -- Jewish agencies to look for survivor\u2019s names. I wrote to the international Red Cross.

And I looked through -- through this book and I found two pictures where my uncle was in it and that\u2019s when I contacted that professor and I wanted to know and that\u2019s what he told me. He said if I went to Koblins, the people there are very accommodating and I could look through any pictures I want to. But of course, I didn\u2019t do that. I had a sick son, whom I lost since."

            "question": "And where were these pictures taken, that the professor had?",
            "answer": "It seems to me that it was taken on the stage of a theater in the ghetto. There were two or three theaters, one of which was familiar to me because my uncle performed there. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection And th-the name of the theater was Azazel. And I used to go there, almost daily to watch the performances of -- of the theater, I used to love it. And I used to go there every day after so-called school. There was no school for us, but we had a professor who formed classes in his house. And he was paid by my parent with whatever they had. Could be a pair of socks for his children or whatever. And he formed a class. So some of us -- we started out with about eight or 10 children in the class and little by little, there were fewer, because they were caught, they died, or whatever. So, every day after the classes, I would run over to the theater and watch the performances. So, when I saw the pictures, I saw also the other actors, whom I knew, whom I met there. And I tried to even locate them, but it -- it is not very easy. Although I was good at locating people -- I knew where to go and how to go about it, but those people I couldn\u2019t locate. So, I recognize on the picture the stage, and it must have been taken there. I would have loved to go there, to Koblins and look for more pictures and God knows whom I -- I could identify. But, at that time, my younger son was very, very sick and I just -- I just couldn\u2019t do it. I went away somewhere for a week or 10 days, I think to Florida and -- and I was sorry I did, because he couldn\u2019t -- he couldn\u2019t really look after himself, he was very ill. And he passed away Friday the 13th of December, of \u201896. So this Friday -- that -- this 13th of December that\u2019s coming, will be two years that I lost him. So I didn\u2019t pursue any more looking and with me getting so -- falling apart, kind of. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s tough to -- to concentrate on everything."

So, when we were taken, in \u201844, as Christians, there was a thought about it, but the thought was immediately countered by a feeling that this cannot happen because I\u2019m here among Christians and not Jews and they probably would not do that.

And people are trying to find things -- find other people, find their relatives, find a place to stay, acquire some clothes, acquire some food. It was quite chaotic, but the allies brought in a lot of help. There was one synagogue, I remember, and in that synagogue, they had brought in blankets and clothes and some food packages I think, I\u2019m not sure. And they were distributed to -- to people who needed them. The German people were -- also were quite depressed and they needed some help, too; they had no food. However, it was in a short period of time, there was -- a black market developed. Ill never forget that, it was called Alexanderplatz and in -- in that place, you could probably trade for everything you needed. You could buy or sell or whatever. The German people would bring out their wares, maybe their clothes or their watches or whatever, to sell, to exchange for food. The survivors were -- were looking for everything that they couldn\u2019t get from the Jewish agency. Oh, that\u2019s the word I was looking, the Jewish agency, not government. So, it was a time of confusion and people, being very eager and looking for things and for people. Somehow, one tried to help the other.

There was a Jewish holiday and Peppy invited the Jewish soldiers from the allied armies to come and celebrate the Jewish holiday. And I remember they were Russians, they were Americans, British, French. I don\u2019t think there were any Polish. And whatever Peppy cou-could get in the way of food, she would prepare and there were candles lit and this was -- this was a- a thing that will always bring tears to my eyes, because this is the first time that people in different uniforms of different countries, sat at the table and recited the same prayer. Whatever food there was, I don\u2019t remember. Probably wasn\u2019t much and probably some of it was that the allies brought in in cans or whatever. But the li -- the -- the candles were lit and all the different nations, who couldn\u2019t speak to each other because of the language barrier, they could recite the same prayer.

Took a long time to -- to get back to what I call, to normal. Maybe that\u2019s the reason that I can recognize survivors. There is something that tells us, oh, we\u2019re all right. We\u2019re okay. We\u2019re not what the Nazis told -- told the world that we are. We\u2019re a people and some of us are -- are really nice. And then, when you think about it and you read about it, we have given the world quite a few good things. So, I don\u2019t think anybody should hate us, but that\u2019s my opinion. That\u2019s my opinion. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

If they don\u2019t treat you well, you can find out why or you can not communicate with these people any more. But you, as my child, your approach should be to everybody, treat them the same and treat them well. I think I did the right thing by telling them that.

This person, I don\u2019t think I have anything in common with that person, and yet, he\u2019s my friend. I have quite a few friends with whom I have nothing in common, not in the past and not in the present.

You don\u2019t become close friends with just anybody, but you -- there is a difference between friends and -- and -- and acquaintances.
