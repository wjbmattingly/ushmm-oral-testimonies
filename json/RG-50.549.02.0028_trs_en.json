            "answer": "I can give you approximate times. A-All I remember, actually, was the seasons of the year, whether it was cold or hot. My mother disappeared, I think it was 1942 and it must have been July, or August, was very hot. And I understand that there was a big German aktion in town and that\u2019s when she -- when she was caught in the street and brought to the Umschlagplatz, which was the -- the railroad station, where they took all the people, to send them out. I found out later on that people who were caught and -- that day, were sent to Treblinka right away."

Where we lived, we went to work at the brush makers, making brushes. And my father and my sister and I, we lived at the Narlefke Street. This was already maybe the third or fourth time that we have moved, since we were thrown out of our own apartment and moved into the ghetto. My father went to work at that particular time and did not return. It seems to have been an aktion and all people from the factory were taken out. So he never returned."

            "answer": "After my father. I-It must have been -- it must have been the end of \u201842, I think. There was an aktion where the Germans came into the building and flushed out -- or at least tried to flush out everybody from their hiding places. And at that time, we were 1n an apartment on -- on the street floor, just a few steps going up. And the -- We were left -- my aunt was left, my Aunt Esther. My grandmother was left. My Aunt Esther\u2019s little boy, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection who was about three years old, yeah, it must have been \u201842. And my sister and I. And when we heard that the Germans are coming in, we started hiding. Now, my grandmother, my aunt and her little boy, went to a little cabinet underneath the window, which was used instead of -- instead of a refrigerator. And th-the walls of the building were thick, so there was enough room for those people to get in and I closed the door and put a chair in front of it. And my sister didn\u2019t know -- I -- we didn\u2019t know what to do. So we had a folding bed that when it was folded up, it looked like a table. And she crawled in there and I put a -- a cover over it and then I didn\u2019t know what to do, the Germans were already in, so I opened the door to the bathroom, but they looked in the bathroom, too. Then I saw on the -- at the wall -- on the wall of the bathroom, it was a ladder and on top of it was a shelf. There was also a light bulb above the shelf. And I don\u2019t know how I was able to, but I really went up the ladder and sat down on the shelf and unscrewed the bulb, making sure that no-none of my clothes hang down. By that time, I could hear the Germans in the hallway, coming in and my heart was banging so hard I hoped they didn\u2019t hear it. And that\u2019s when they found my sister, and they took her out. At that time they didn\u2019t find my grandmother, my aunt or my little cousin. But they did find my sister. Some people told me afterwards, some neighbors, that she was shot. I cannot recall -- I was in such shock, that I don\u2019t remember what I heard and what I saw. I just remembered that I heard her cry and they took her out. They found her in the bed."

And I wonder what that was like for you, what you remember feeling, that you never really knew what happened to them, you s -- they just disappeared.",

And my uncle, at that time, tried to -- to contact some friends who worked with the police -- with the Jewish police. But, before anything could happen, we got word that the trains left. So, we know that she was caught there and that she was there. And of course, the trains left to Treblinka, that\u2019s what we were advised. When my father didn\u2019t come back, we did not hear anything, except that there was the aktion in the factory and the people were taken out. And this was, oh, I would estimate maybe two months or three months after my mother, because I remember the weather was windy. I really had to judge everything by the weather. I had no knowledge of dates. There was no calendar to look at. And I think that I was too young or inexperienced to -- to really remember dates. Life there was like life of a rat that is hiding and it\u2019s constantly chased. And one does not know exactly where and when it 1s, day, night, summer, winter. This kind of sticks in the mind because it is -- you remember whether you were cold or -- or hot. But the dates -- exact dates are not known to me. Later on, when I listened to some people, who were a little bit older, even three, four years older than I am, they knew dates. I have a friend who is 10 years my senior, she remembers every date and she has a terrific memory. But I don\u2019t remember the exact dates."

I know that the thought that was the most important, was survival and probably I -- probably I thought, \u201cHow can I survive without them?\u201d It was actually a -- a selfish feeling, probably. It\u2019s very hard to describe, I even get goosebumps when I -- when I talk about it, even now, because now I -- I miss them. For all these years, I\u2019ve been missing them. But in those days, I think 1t was more of a -- of a self- preservation feeling. Of a, \u2018What am I going to do without them?\u2019 And that\u2019s all that comes to mind.

Went to agent -- Jewish agencies to look for survivor\u2019s names. I wrote to the international Red Cross. I even wrote to them to find out if they heard anything from my parents, because I hadn\u2019t seen them being killed and -- and -- and I thought that maybe miracle do happen and people do survive.

And I looked through -- through this book and I found two pictures where my uncle was in it and that\u2019s when I contacted that professor and I wanted to know and that\u2019s what he told me. He said if I went to Koblins, the people there are very accommodating and I could look through any pictures I want to. But of course, I didn\u2019t do that. I had a sick son, whom I lost since."

            "num": 24,
            "question": "And where were these pictures taken, that the professor had?",
            "answer": "It seems to me that it was taken on the stage of a theater in the ghetto. There were two or three theaters, one of which was familiar to me because my uncle performed there. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection And th-the name of the theater was Azazel. And I used to go there, almost daily to watch the performances of -- of the theater, I used to love it. And I used to go there every day after so-called school. There was no school for us, but we had a professor who formed classes in his house. And he was paid by my parent with whatever they had. Could be a pair of socks for his children or whatever. And he formed a class. So some of us -- we started out with about eight or 10 children in the class and little by little, there were fewer, because they were caught, they died, or whatever. So, every day after the classes, I would run over to the theater and watch the performances. So, when I saw the pictures, I saw also the other actors, whom I knew, whom I met there. And I tried to even locate them, but it -- it is not very easy. Although I was good at locating people -- I knew where to go and how to go about it, but those people I couldn\u2019t locate. So, I recognize on the picture the stage, and it must have been taken there. I would have loved to go there, to Koblins and look for more pictures and God knows whom I -- I could identify. But, at that time, my younger son was very, very sick and I just -- I just couldn\u2019t do it. I went away somewhere for a week or 10 days, I think to Florida and -- and I was sorry I did, because he couldn\u2019t -- he couldn\u2019t really look after himself, he was very ill. And he passed away Friday the 13th of December, of \u201896. So this Friday -- that -- this 13th of December that\u2019s coming, will be two years that I lost him. So I didn\u2019t pursue any more looking and with me getting so -- falling apart, kind of. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s tough to -- to concentrate on everything."

When -- When we were at -- when my uncle smuggled us out of the ghetto, we -- he prepared, with the help of my other uncle, his brother and -- and her - and his wife, they prepared an apartment. And my aunt\u2019s brother made a double wall in a room without a window and we could hide there.

This is a war, there were all kinds of rumors going on, because at -- at some point, we were -- we were bombed by the Cartushas from -- from the other side of the river. And they were, I think, the Russian Cartushas. And sometimes we heard airplanes and shooting, lot of shooting, and there were some direct hits. But it was a different feeling for me. They were not chasing me because I was Jewish. It was just a war.

So, when we were taken, in \u201844, as Christians, there was a thought about it, but the thought was immediately countered by a feeling that this cannot happen because I\u2019m here among Christians and not Jews and they probably would not do that.

Was a course of -- I think the power of negotiation or something like that. Was given by a very good instructor. And before the course, the instructor told us to write down everything we know how to do. And people were writing and writing and writing and I just wrote one word, survive. The instructor was not very pleased and she wanted explanation. But that was what I thought my main achievement in life, to survive. It is -- That feeling 1s terribly strong, especially it was for me, I -- I -- I figured fo-for everybody. And people did lot of things to survive."

Tell me what the- what the atmosphere was like at that time. Was it filled with people? Did it -- What did it seem like?",
            "answer": "Well, the atmosphere was chaotic. There were a lot of foreigners, many people, many survivors came. They were military of all area -- al-allied groups. And people are trying to find things -- find other people, find their relatives, find a place to stay, acquire some clothes, acquire some food. It was quite chaotic, but the allies brought in a lot of help. There was one synagogue, I remember, and in that synagogue, they had brought in blankets and clothes and some food packages I think, I\u2019m not sure. And they were distributed to -- to people who needed them. The German people were -- also were quite depressed and they needed some help, too; they had no food. However, it was in a short period of time, there was -- a black market developed. Ill never forget that, it was called Alexanderplatz and in -- in that place, you could probably trade for everything you needed. You could buy or sell or whatever. The German people would bring out their wares, maybe their clothes or their watches or whatever, to sell, to exchange for food. The survivors were -- were looking for everything that they couldn\u2019t get from the Jewish agency. Oh, that\u2019s the word I was looking, the Jewish agency, not government. So, it was a time of confusion and people, being very eager and looking for things and for people. Somehow, one tried to help the other. It was a very nice day and I can\u2019t remember what Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection kind of a Jewi-Jewish holiday it was, it\u2019s very hard for me to tell. There was a Jewish holiday and Peppy invited the Jewish soldiers from the allied armies to come and celebrate the Jewish holiday. And I remember they were Russians, they were Americans, British, French. I don\u2019t think there were any Polish. And whatever Peppy cou-could get in the way of food, she would prepare and there were candles lit and this was -- this was a- a thing that will always bring tears to my eyes, because this is the first time that people in different uniforms of different countries, sat at the table and recited the same prayer. Whatever food there was, I don\u2019t remember. Probably wasn\u2019t much and probably some of it was that the allies brought in in cans or whatever. But the li -- the -- the candles were lit and all the different nations, who couldn\u2019t speak to each other because of the language barrier, they could recite the same prayer. And that was something that I will always remember."

That\u2019s where I was going anywhere. But, as we were put in the jail cells, there were some people from Ukraine. And they told me that you really don\u2019t go home, they don\u2019t send you home. They send you somewhere in Russia, wherever they want to. I was scared. I don\u2019t want to go anywhere in Russia, I wanted to go to Warsaw. And the mere fact that we were locked up and not let out, scared me again. So this -- this person that was there told me how to escape, and I did."

So, he escorted me to the bathroom and he was walking up and down the hallway, huge hallway. So, I watched when he was very far away with the back to me, and I walked out and down the stairs and I -- very wide stairs. On each side there were policeman. Polish -- No, not a Pole -- German police and German soldier, I think. I remember the police, but there were two of them on each side. And when I walked out, I walked in the middle of the stairs, head high and very sure of myself. And nobody said anything. I -- I looked left and right, wherever I saw a corner of the -- of the street, closer. I think it was to the right. I turned right and I walked -- I kind of marched, until I hit the corner. When I went around the corner, I started running. And I ran very quickly. I went back to the railroad station. I had no money for a ticket, but 1t was -- I just went so quickly and I yelled something, I think in Russian or in Polish, when they wanted a ticket -- I didn\u2019t give them. And -- and because I saw the train started moving and I hopped in the train. And the train took me back to Berlin. It was the only train I could see there. It lucky took me to Berlin, it could have taken me somewhere else. So I went back to Berlin. On the way, they stopped and they looked for people again, but then I was lucky. I -- When -- When I jumped in to the train and I saw there were some Russian officers sitting and they showed me that I could sit next to them, so I did. And that\u2019s where my Russian language kind of -- although broken, but it was helpful. And they started talking to me a-and I said, \u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d They told me, \u201cAre you going to Berlin, too?\u201d So I said yes. I was glad to know it\u2019s Berlin. And I told them yes, I was going to Berlin too, to see my relatives, who were there after the war. And we developed a nice conversation. And when the train stopped at night and the other Russian soldiers came to look for foreigners, this particular officer, who sat across this -- the bench from me, he said to the soldiers, \u201cGo away, it\u2019s middle of the night, we\u2019re all sleepy. Go away.\u201d I couldn\u2019t be happier. And the soldier went away. So I could go back - otherwise, I would be caught again and brought to jail again. And I didn\u2019t know -- it -- it scared me, the fact that -- that they put us 1n jail before they send me away, that scared me. I would have been glad to go home, just because I was on my way.

We also went on patrols, night patrols, day patrols and whatever needed to be done, we did participate. However, I understand that we were not sent out of the area. We were only 1n that area, because I remembered when a different group of pamah came in. One group moved and one group came in. But we were on the left, where we were.

            "answer": "It was. It was emotional f-for s-several reasons. To begin with, it\u2019s the place that you thought you know. And all of a sudden, I find that I couldn\u2019t recognize everything. Mainly the things that were rebuilt and of course, they could have been rebuilt a little differently. But, also, I couldn\u2019t recognize -- I thought there was a street somewhere and then you go there, no, that there was no street, there is just a block. In other words, the memory plays a little trick. And I was upset about that. On the other hand, there were some things that I remembered and I told my son, \u201cWhen we\u2019ll go around the corner, we'll see steps mai --\u201d At that time they were made of stone, I think. But they go all the way down to the -- to the river. And he looks at me, we take a walk. Just around the corner, here are the steps, only they are made of wood and they are much nicer now. So, it brought back -- it brought back my -- my self confidence. We had -- he -- his birthday was while we were there, so we went to a very fancy restaurant and we were much impressed with -- with the restaurant and with the food they served and with the service they had. So that was one nice thing about it. But, when we went to another place, we found some -- some anti-Semitism exists, yeah. Which was not that great, and I wish it would go away."

Over there, I s -- I heard them being used a lot and it seems to be kind of degrading. Why don\u2019t they get rid of those expressions? There -- There are very few Jews now in Poland, very few, and mainly they are old and they are there because they have no place to go. I wonder why the people are so angry with us. There are no Jews there for 50 years. What could we do -- what we could have done to make those people still angry with us? A-And they are still using some expressions, they probably inherited them. Maybe they -- I don\u2019t know if they stop to think, but they should."

Of course, when I say singled out, I don\u2019t mean people who are lawless. I\u2019m talking about the political things that are happening. For politics people get killed and mistreated. I simply wish it would go away, because it - it isn\u2019t worth it. Life is so short and when you treat people nice, you treat everybody nice and everybody treats you nice, isn\u2019t that a world we want to live in? To help one another, rather than to fight. I see no good reason to -- to have any wars. I may be very, very stupid, I see no reasons for it, or -- we\u2019re talking now about -- about preparing weapons of mass destruction. That is awful. Who needs that? And sometimes I think that having gone through what I have, I wish I could live in a world that is peaceful and the same for my children, my son and daughter-in-law, their families. For my friends, I wish we had peace, we -- everybody would really benefit from it."

Women should get jobs that they are good for, just like men should get jobs that they are good for. I don\u2019t think that they should be chosen on the basis of their sex, but because of what they can do on a job. That\u2019s what they should do. But, I also believe that women are different from men. So, some of those movements that you mention, don\u2019t fall into any category. I would pull out -- some points out of it and say, where work is concerned, it goes by ability, who is able to do what. Should be doing th-that thing and get paid the same. When it comes to personal lives, women are different from men, period, no matter what. And as -- as such, we have to behave as such and we shouldn\u2019t change our behavior. I don\u2019t like to see boys walking around in dresses or -- or -- or -- or girls wearing man\u2019s suits. We are -- I feel that in private life, in personal life, men are men and women are women, should act as such and behave as such. That does not mean that it\u2019s a woman\u2019s job to cook the supper. If he is a better cook, he should do it. If he comes home earlier from work, he should do it. It is sharing, it 1s -- 1t is equality in where it counts. But we\u2019re -- we\u2019re not the same, we\u2019re much different. And as they say, vive la difference. I believe in that. But I\u2019d like to get paid as much as a man if I do the work that a man does."
