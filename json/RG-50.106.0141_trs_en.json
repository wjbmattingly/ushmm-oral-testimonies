            "answer": "Well, that\u2019s a very interesting question and I will illustrate it by, well, telling you what happened to me. I\u2014I went to a German school, as a matter of fact I was the only \u2014 during Hitler time already, from 1934 to 1938 to Kristallnacht, I was the only Jewish student in a Ss \u2014s \u2014 student body of about 280 in a high school that was a [indecipherable] gymnasium. One of the assignments we had \u2014 now thas \u2014 this was about 1936, and Germany of course was very, a-as we would say, a \u2014 a roots \u2014 you know, tracing your roots. They were interested in genealogy. So one of our assignments in social studies was This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

How was I gonna trace my ancestry? My \u2014 I \u2014 ma \u2014 my mother contacted her sister, a maiden sister who lived with my \u2014 in my mother\u2019s home village, and contacted my father\u2019s maiden sister, who lived in my father\u2019s home village, and they both yeah, tried to do \u2014 trace our history. And Martha, which was the Roberg side of the family, got as far as great-grandfather, didn\u2019t get very far. And Aunt Babette(ph) of the Marx family, my mother\u2019s family near \u2014 in a village called Byetahl(ph) near Heidelberg was much more successful. She first traced the history back to 1871, which was written up in the local \u2014 what do we call it in German? Standes amt, the local village registry. Prior to that, all births and deaths were, even of the Jewish community were inter \u2014 entered in the church registry of the Catholic church. So she went to the priest and he, as a favor, for 10 mark or so, wrote out our whole genealogy and we were able to trace the f \u2014 Marx family back to 1741. So I drew up a family tree based on this information. This took about oh, a couple of months to get that all written out by hand, turning the pages in the book and it became a matter of fascination for the priest himself. And I drew a\u2014a family tree, and I turned it in and it turned out that Roberg, the only Jew in the class, could trace his ancestry in Germany back further than my 29 Christian stu \u2014 fellow students. And my teacher, who was very s-supportive, and nya \u2014 he was not a Nazi by any means, he made a point of it, to \u2014 yeah, tell the class that Roberg could trace his ancestry back further than any of the German boys. So it\u2019s a longwinded answer to your very brief question.  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

            "answer": "Ah, it\u2019s a good question. We were a small Jewish congregation, but rather distinct. Celle, as you may or may not know, is of historic significance in that it was a m \u2014 the seat of a duke, Herzog, the Duke of Brunswick-Ltineburg \u2014 Brunswick-Luneburg, and so it was a white collar community. Our synagogue in Celle was built in 1741 and is today the on \u2014 the only surviving synagogue in northern Germany that was \u2014 well, it was vandalized of course, but that survived, it was not burned or destroyed. It was destroyed from the inside, but the building remains. It was during my time, had of course gone past its peak, people had started moving away after World War I. Some families moved to Hannover, which was 40 kilometers. 25 miles away was the nearest large city, some moved to Berlin. The remaining active members in the community were about a dozen families. There were some Jewish people who were not active, they didn\u2019t attend services. They, I guess were Jews by religion only, or th-they \u2014 the Germans so nicely put it, Jewish citizens of a Hebrew faith or persuasion. And that was by \u2014 by choice, they really didn't want to be identified with the Jewish community per se, and that was their choice. Give you an illustration, for \u2014 we only had services in our synagogue three times  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Well, Simchas Torah was observed, and you know, but we had trouble getting a minyan together, of course, and we were, by German standards Conservative, not Orthodox, but the synagogue of course was built, like m-m-most German synagogues with the women in \u2014 in the upper, on the balcony, whatever you call it, and the men downstairs and only men counted for \u2014 yeah, for minyan. However, if you were 12 years old and you were gonna be Bar Mitzvahed the following year, you could already be counted as a minyan man. So it was that kind of a thing, or if things got very tough and we were nine, as a last resort they would say \u2014 we would send one of the boys, sometimes me, over to one of the non-observing Jews, one of them was Solomon \u2014 Solomon and say \u2014 ask Solomon if hell come to minyan, you know, and then reluctantly and grumpily would come and di \u2014 um, sit in for minyan."

This guy was waiting with \u2014 of course, the word had spread, he\u2019s going to fight with Roberg, the Jew, whatever they had spread. And everybody was around, I took off my \u2014 my backpack, we had a Tornister it was called, a backpack. Took off my \u2014 my jacket and got into a fight. I\u2019d never fought in my life, but I knew what to do, I was interested in Schmeling and Sharkey and Joe Louis, I think was around already. So I knew about fighting. And we started squaring off and he landed some punches and I landed a lucky Sunday punch and bloodied his nose. So I was the first \u2014 first one to draw blood. Just then somebody hollered jute(ph), jute(ph), which does not mean Jew, but \u2014 although it\u2019s close to it. A teacher approached too late, now we weren\u2019t allowed to fight even \u2014 even in the park. And he came right to it, he says, what is this fighting, why are you fighting? I said, well he c \u2014 he called me juditsich(ph) and challenged me to a fight, I am fighting. So the teacher addressed the other boy and says, now that\u2019s not nice. You shouldn\u2019t say a thing like that. Now I want you to stop fighting and you both go home and that\u2019s the end of it. And that\u2019s how it was settled. So I came out the victor.

And when we recited class \u2014 in class, you know, vocabulary or whatever with the windows open, she could hear us recite. Okay, what\u2019s that [indecipherable]. So she said, I think you should \u2014 better go to school. Go like any other day. If there is a problem, we had a whistle, with which we were also summoned home if we were out in the street, Pll blow the whistle three times. So I went to sc \u2014 class, and I must say my teacher, my homeroom teacher, Studienrat Klem(ph) was a fabulous guy who really supported me all the way. He was not a Nazi, I mean he was anything but. I must say the entire schoolyo \u2014 teachers\u2019 body, with one or two exceptions, were fabulous to me and very supportive. So he came into class and of course in those days, you know, ba \u2014 when the teacher came into class everybody had to stand up and heil Hitler, you know, they were \u2014 and he \u2014 he would just go, sit down.

So everybody in class knew and they looked at me, but nobody said anything. And he \u2014 the \u2014 Klem(ph) called me up and said, do you know what is going on in town? I said yes, I heard. He says, do you want to stay in school? I said yes, I\u2019d like to stay in school, school like any other day. He says okay, any time you want to go home, you can go. So I went, and the intermission was at 10 o\u2019clock and I looked over to our house and everything was quiet. I could see our kitchen and bedroom windows from the schoolyard. And I went back into class and then at about a quarter to 11 or so, I heard my mother blow the whistle. So I asked Studienrat Klem(ph), I \u2014 may I go home? Yes, of course. And yeah, I did this very unobtrusive, I left my books there. I just went out of the classroom like I went to the toilet, but I didn\u2019t come back. I didn\u2019t want to make waves, you know, picking up my books and \u2014 and going out. I left my books and I just \u2014 like I went to the bathroom, but I went home.

Schnell. So I wrote on this postcard, we are well. Our old neighbor Herr Schnell had plenty of work for at least a week. So they knew how to interpret that, the censor didn\u2019t.

Meaning we were able to send something to Switzerland, okay? So that\u2019s how we disguised information. I think that was pretty common. You just had to adapt to conditions, and you did. And it became actually, a sport to try to outwit the Germans. That was our mentality and it was also, that\u2019s what kept us going.

You could take your American visa and whatever, okay? You would never get your exit permit. So they gave us another one week extension. Now within that week we still did not have the papers.

Wannsee was there was a large estate which was \u2014 course had been Jewish, that was confiscated and had been made as a R and R retreat for the SS. They were still in the process of fixing that up and the Jewish congregation apparently had somehow managed to arrange that they will supply X number of workers every day. Let\u2019s say 50 workers for doing ground keeping etcetera. So now we were assigned twice a week to go out and work in Wannsee. The Gestapo out there didn\u2019t care who came. Now we were \u2014 we were briefed, we were told, you will see people in striped suits that are guarded by soldiers with guns. Don\u2019t even look at them, make no eye contact with anyone.

Do your work, keep your head down, mind your own business, don\u2019t make waves, okay? So, with those instructions we took the S-Bahn, the subway, the elevated out to Wannsee and we went to work, raking, cleaning up, whatever they told us to do.

                " Well, now we were in Spain and while we knew, of course, that Spain, Franco\u2019s Spain was very sympathetic to the Germans, at least we had the feeling that we were not under direct German control any more. The people who had organized our trip had arranged for us to be overnight in San Sebastian and we stayed at the finest five star hotel, the Marie Louise, I think it is called, where we spent a glorious night and then went on by train, and as we were riding through the Spanish countryside, we really saw an appalling sight. Spain had just come out of the civil war which lasted what, four years, five years? And the people were devastated. We had hoarded bread for our trip because we had to take along food for five days. We were locked into a \u2014 into a car and we knew there was no food in \u2014 in Spain, so this was our third day. And suddenly we had really poor people coming along the railroad car and as we were standing at this station, or if we were on a siding somewhere, begging, begging for bread and offering us oranges. I hadn\u2019t seen an orange since I left Holland. In Holland we had oranges, but Germany had no oranges. So we traded bread for oranges. And then while the train then made its way slowly to the Spanish border, to the \u2014 to the Spanish-Portuguese border, and there we had to change again into a Portuguese train, which was \u2014  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We arrived in Lisbon and we were put up by the Jewish community there m \u2014 or the organization that was sponsoring our trip, assumably the HIAS. We were put up in a pensionne and we had a very interesting experience. About the day after we arrived, a man came to our pensionne and said, I am from the free Dutch government in London.

There was a Dutch force \u2014 air force, and you know, whatever, armed forces and we were very eager to help the allies. So he says well, I would like to interview you. I will come back tomorrow and I'd like you to \u2014 you know, to tell me whatever you can. And we were most eager to tell him. So we met the following day, it was about six o\u2019clock at night. I and two other boys, Jerry Cohen(ph), who was fluent in Dutch and one other boy. And first we went to a restaurant, caf \u2014 caf\u00e9 on the main square in Lisbon and he ordered coffee for us, and oh, we were glad to have real coffee after that bilge water we \u2014 we got in Germany. And then he said, don\u2019t turn around but I don\u2019t think we can talk here because there is an \u2014 an foreign agent sitting at another table, watching us. We better leave here. And of course we were not aware of \u2014 you know, we hadn\u2019t seen any of the movies that \u2014 that showed that friend and foe met in Lisbon.

All I can say is thank heaven he was legitimate. What we found out later, he could have been a German agent who posed as a free Dutch agent. Well, we spilled our guts. We told him what the Germans had done in Holland. We told him where the fortifications were in Berlin in the \u20141in the zoo area, Tiergarten and th-th-they had built high rise bunkers they call them,  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

What we didn\u2019t realize was that there were just as many German agents there as there were English and Dutch and whatever else.

So li \u2014 look at my passport, ah, sit over here. A couple of other people sat over there, most people could go again. And then finally he calls me back. Kurt Roberg? Yeah. Why are you trying to enter this country with an expired visa? I said, my visa was good when I came aboard ship. My visa expired at midnight. I was aboard ship at six p.m. According to the ship\u2019s log, this vessel sailed on June first. Your visa expired May 31. You can\u2019t come in. What do you mean I can\u2019t come in? I didn\u2019t say that, but I\u2014 we were taught to be humble, even in America. So, well, we docked in Hoboken, as was customary in those days. American export line docked in Hoboken, not in New York. And of course my mother knew \u2014 oh, I had \u2014 I had borrowed three dollars from a German speaking steward on board, to send a telegram from aboard ship to my mother that I was coming. She hadn\u2019t heard from me since I was in Berlin. I didn\u2019t write because every week we were supposed to leave and I was going to be there before the letters, right? So I didn\u2019t write. I wrote to my uncle, and he wrote to my mother and that\u2019s how she got word about what was happening with me, but I didn\u2019t write, and well, she went crazy \u2014 I mean, she understood, but why didn\u2019t you write? Anyway, so she was down on the pier and I was up on board. All the passengers were leaving the ship except me and one other woman, we stayed on board. Do you think they would have let my mother up, or me down? No, not in America. We waved, she cried. I guess I was teary- eyed. And I remember I s \u2014 I called to my mother, Mother, are you wearing lipstick? She says, yes, in America we \u2014 in America we wear lipstick.

I said, before you know it you probably will \u2014 will paint your nails red, too. So those were the little \u2014 and that \u2014 that sort of stuck in my mind. Now anyway, my mother was told that I could not come down. We hollered up and down, you know, across the \u2014 and they told me that I'd have to go to Ellis Island for a hearing, just a formality. And my mother, of course, went the next day just for this formality and there was a hearing before a judge, and he looked at my papers and decided that well, they couldn\u2019t let me in. Now they \u2014 the visa was definitely expired. As a matter of fact, there was something wrong with the visa. The visa was issued on January 31\u00b0, it should have only gone to May 30\". They gave you an extra day, why? Oh, this will have to go to Washington, the State Department will have to handle that. And so it happened that Kurt Roberg stayed on Ellis Island for four weeks while they debated in Washington whether they could take a risk, the risk of letting me in, or whether they would send me back. And I guess lawyers came cheap in those days. American export lines had their lawyers working on it, because they would have had to pay another 210 dollars to take me back to Lisbon and obviously lawyers were paid a lot less than that in those days. So after four weeks they finally re \u2014 relented and \u2014 and they said, you can stay."

I\u2019m considered, probably considered one of the more Conservative, but then the Reform movement is going toward Conservative anyway, you know, it\u2019s not what it was 30 years ago, Reform is no longer Reform. So no, I have no \u2014 I \u2014I don\u2019t think I\u2019m any more or less religious. I mean, the question of whether there is a God, you know, what does it really mean is deeply philosophical, I don\u2019t think we should get into that. But my children are not religious. I don\u2019t particularly \u2014 well, I wish they were more oriented  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They don\u2019t. But then, we gave \u2014 you know, those of us who give our children the freedom of decision making, we exposed them to Judaism, Jewish teachings. Unfortunately the Hebrew schools that they went to, while we thought they were excellent, turned them off rather than the other way, than inspired them. The damage was done, they \u2014 they had the choice of, you know, or th \u2014 they have the option of choosing and whatever they choose, what\u2019s important is they are good people, they are decent human beings and that is what religion is supposed to do, in my view, 1s make decent people of everyone; the purpose of religion, one of the purposes of religion. And that is the case, so I have no \u2014 I have no quarrel or problem with how they achieve their goodness, of being good. If they want to find religion, if later in their lives they turn toward religion, as a lot of people do, so be it, you know, but I \u2014 I have no \u2014 no problem with that. I mean, that\u2019s my view. End of Tape Five, Side A Beginning Tape Five, Side B"

            "answer": "Yes, I \u2014 well, I-I\u2019m certainly more aware of it, but I\u2019m also aware of the abuses and of the limitations and it\u2019s interesting that I\u2019ve gone back to Germany many times and the change I see in Germany today, the change toward democracy is really remarkable. I had a very interesting experience. As a matter of fact I [indecipherable] I went back to my hometown, Celle on the anniversary of Crystal Night in \u201998, 50\" anniversary and participated in a \u2014 well, I really instigated a memorial service at the synagogue in Celle, and I went over there for that and I was the keynote speaker. And I'll be glad to send you a copy of that speech. It was held in German, but I made a fairly accurate English translation for my congregation and for my friends. So Ill send you that, and you can put it into the records. But 1\u2014 I really \u2014 and I met with some of my former classmates for whom I would vouch that they were not Nazis then or now. And it was a very interesting experience and I think sort of telling. The \u2014 yeah, what went on under Hitler, how a lot of Germans who were, let\u2019s say scared into following the party line. Of course there was a meal ticket too, that they didn\u2019t dare to go across the \u2014 against the party line because it meant their livelihood. And I think there is really a lot of true democracy, especially in the young people. We \u2014 we read about the skinheads, the anti-Semitism, etcetera. But just like here, the good people don\u2019t make news, it\u2019s the bad people that make the news, and I think in our society too, you hear about the killings of \u2014 you know, the teenagers that are shooting up our schools and all that, but you don\u2019t read about the good kids or the kids that are scared. I met a little girl in Florida, she\u2019s 11 years old. There was a \u2014 well, talk  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

You know, there are \u2014 so what I\u2019m saying 1s there\u2019s good and bad everywhere. We don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t hear about the good kids, we only hear about the bad kids. And I think you as a \u2014 as an educator, know that that is so. To condemn a whole generation or sector of the population because of a few, is unfair. Any time you generalize, it\u2019s unfair, or even inaccurate. What\u2019s his name, Goldhagen? Every German is guilty? I haven\u2019t read his book. I read the synopsis in the \u201cNew York Times\u201d book review and all that. I don\u2019t want to read his book. He can come with statistics, but I don\u2019t think that every German down \u2014 deep down in his heart, felt anti-Semitic or was part \u2014 part-participated or wanted to participate. So he has a formula; that formula too, is not accurate. I think you have to take people as individuals and that\u2019s what I try to do. They\u2019re good and they\u2019re not so good and they\u2019 re outright bad. And n \u2014 that has been \u2014 I mean, I made my peace with Germany in 19 \u2014 in the 1950\u2019s, when I went back the first time on business with Hans Solomon(ph). We went back to Germany to try and do business in 1952. We went to the photo show in Cologne and we spent two weeks in Celle. Now he, being 15 years older than I, was there as an adult. He remem \u2014 knew a lot more people, and we looked up a lot of them and talked to them. Of course, in the 50\u2019s, nobody would know or admit that they knew anything. But we talked to people who said yes, we knew that Bergen-Belsen, which was 15 miles away from Celle, that 1t was there, but we didn\u2019t know what was going on. We \u2014 the man who was \u2014  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But he was told these are foreign Zwangsarbeiter, forced labor. But that they were systematically starved to death, or whatever, worked to death, he didn\u2019t know that. Nobody \u2014 nobody knew that other than the guards and the guards didn\u2019t tell, because it was self-incriminating. He supplied meats, he supplied food. Hey, we\u2019re taking food in there every week, you know. Whether \u2014 that this was only for the guards or whatever, nobody knew, right? So what I am \u2014 what I am saying is that we did talk about it. Ther- There was a death march where people were marched from the railroad 15 miles to the camp. And yes, some of the people saw it and even taunted the prisoners and whatever, you know, on the death \u2014 that came out later. Yes, but those people aren\u2019t going to talk about it or advertise it or admit it, even. They are the ones that say, we don\u2019t want to talk about the past any more, we want to lo \u2014 but the young Germans, who now \u2014 I mean \u2014 I mean the new, young generation, whose grandparents were the perpetrators, participants or silent participants, they are now asking, why did you keep quiet? How could you k- keep quiet? They don\u2019t understand how they could have \u2014 how their parents and grandparents could have kept quiet. And it\u2019s very hard in the 1990\u2019s, or 2000, to understand what the mentality was 50 years ago unless, you know the zeitgeist of the era, what the fears were, what the attitudes were and why people kept quiet. Why people didn\u2019t speak out. They were scared.

And he had the key for the ar \u2014 in \u2014 in the building, and up on \u2014 on the roof was a flag \u2014 you know, f \u2014 a \u2014a flagstaff. And when the Nazis took over, they went up there to pull down the red, white and blue flag to hoist the Nazi flag. And who has the key? Rusterfeld(ph) has the key, get Rusterfeld(ph), and they said, we want the key. I don\u2019t have the key. Well, give us the key or we\u2019ll break down the door. So he rummaged and he found the key. And as they stormed up there and up there, he was heard to mumble under his breath, I hope they break their neck. Somebody heard it and he was indicted and \u2014 that he made this remark. He had enough friends in the court system that witnesses came up and said oh no, you heard it wrong. He said, I hope they don\u2019t break their neck, because it was so dangerous to climb up there. They gave him the benefit of the doubt and he was permitted to retire earl \u2014 take early retirement, okay? Now, there were people like that, okay? And he was watched from there on and he couldn\u2019t afford to make a wrong move, but he didn't permit his daughters to ever join the Nazi party, for the girl they have the JungmAadel or whatever, the Hitler youth. He could have redeemed himself to prove that he was not against them by saying I want you to join, even if it\u2019s only pro forma. No, he stuck to his principles. There were people like that. So who\u2019s to say who is good and who\u2019s bad?"

And I would like it to go on record. I hope I have created a feeling of what the spirit was, both in Holland and in Germany, what the mentality was of the Jews in Celle, certainly. Why they did what th \u2014 why we did what we did, and you know, like some of them said, why do you stay so long? Why \u2014 you know, why didn't you leave earlier?
