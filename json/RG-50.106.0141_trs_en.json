            "question": "Now let\u2019s talk a little bit about your family. How far back can you trace the generations in this area of Germany.",
            "answer": "Well, that\u2019s a very interesting question and I will illustrate it by, well, telling you what happened to me. I\u2014I went to a German school, as a matter of fact I was the only \u2014 during Hitler time already, from 1934 to 1938 to Kristallnacht, I was the only Jewish student in a Ss \u2014s \u2014 student body of about 280 in a high school that was a [indecipherable] gymnasium. One of the assignments we had \u2014 now thas \u2014 this was about 1936, and Germany of course was very, a-as we would say, a \u2014 a roots \u2014 you know, tracing your roots. They were interested in genealogy. So one of our assignments in social studies was Interview with Kurt Roberg , March 16, 2001 to trace our ancestry. How was I gonna trace my ancestry? My \u2014 I \u2014 ma \u2014 my mother contacted her sister, a maiden sister who lived with my \u2014 in my mother\u2019s home village, and contacted my father\u2019s maiden sister, who lived in my father\u2019s home village, and they both yeah, tried to do \u2014 trace our history. And Martha, which was the Roberg side of the family, got as far as great-grandfather, didn\u2019t get very far. And Aunt Babette(ph) of the Marx family, my mother\u2019s family near \u2014 in a village called Byetahl(ph) near Heidelberg was much more successful. She first traced the history back to 1871, which was written up in the local \u2014 what do we call it in German? Standes amt, the local village registry. Prior to that, all births and deaths were, even of the Jewish community were inter \u2014 entered in the church registry of the Catholic church. So she went to the priest and he, as a favor, for 10 mark or so, wrote out our whole genealogy and we were able to trace the f \u2014 Marx family back to 1741. So I drew up a family tree based on this information. This took about oh, a couple of months to get that all written out by hand, turning the pages in the book and it became a matter of fascination for the priest himself. And I drew a\u2014a family tree, and I turned it in and it turned out that Roberg, the only Jew in the class, could trace his ancestry in Germany back further than my 29 Christian stu \u2014 fellow students. And my teacher, who was very s-supportive, and nya \u2014 he was not a Nazi by any means, he made a point of it, to \u2014 yeah, tell the class that Roberg could trace his ancestry back further than any of the German boys. So it\u2019s a longwinded answer to your very brief question. Interview with Kurt Roberg \u00b0 March 16, 2001"

I think it was a marriage that was arranged. I\u2019m not sure, but I think it was through the newspaper, which was the customary way, rather than shotgun. And so that was the then modern Interview with Kurt Roberg \u00b0 March 16, 2001 way. There was the \u2014 a newspaper, Jewish paper called Jiidische Familienblatt, the Jewish Family paper, and there were marriage proposals or whatever and as we have today in some of the better United States papers, started from \u201cThe Village Voice\u201d on."

            "question": "How many Jewish families tell a \u2014 out of a total population?",
            "answer": "Ah, it\u2019s a good question. We were a small Jewish congregation, but rather distinct. Celle, as you may or may not know, is of historic significance in that it was a m \u2014 the seat of a duke, Herzog, the Duke of Brunswick-Ltineburg \u2014 Brunswick-Luneburg, and so it was a white collar community. Our synagogue in Celle was built in 1741 and is today the on \u2014 the only surviving synagogue in northern Germany that was \u2014 well, it was vandalized of course, but that survived, it was not burned or destroyed. It was destroyed from the inside, but the building remains. It was during my time, had of course gone past its peak, people had started moving away after World War I. Some families moved to Hannover, which was 40 kilometers. 25 miles away was the nearest large city, some moved to Berlin. The remaining active members in the community were about a dozen families. There were some Jewish people who were not active, they didn\u2019t attend services. They, I guess were Jews by religion only, or th-they \u2014 the Germans so nicely put it, Jewish citizens of a Hebrew faith or persuasion. And that was by \u2014 by choice, they really didn't want to be identified with the Jewish community per se, and that was their choice. Give you an illustration, for \u2014 we only had services in our synagogue three times Interview with Kurt Roberg \u00b0 March 16, 2001 a year, on the high holidays, rush \u2014 you know, Passover and Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Well, Simchas Torah was observed, and you know, but we had trouble getting a minyan together, of course, and we were, by German standards Conservative, not Orthodox, but the synagogue of course was built, like m-m-most German synagogues with the women in \u2014 in the upper, on the balcony, whatever you call it, and the men downstairs and only men counted for \u2014 yeah, for minyan. However, if you were 12 years old and you were gonna be Bar Mitzvahed the following year, you could already be counted as a minyan man. So it was that kind of a thing, or if things got very tough and we were nine, as a last resort they would say \u2014 we would send one of the boys, sometimes me, over to one of the non-observing Jews, one of them was Solomon \u2014 Solomon and say \u2014 ask Solomon if hell come to minyan, you know, and then reluctantly and grumpily would come and di \u2014 um, sit in for minyan."

My father came from an Orthodox \u2014 well, an observant family. My father\u2019s family, it\u2019s a family of butchers, Interview with Kurt Roberg \u201d March 16, 2001 kosher butchers, but I guess the scene at the turn of the 20\" century was really the \u2014 I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not telling you anything new, you know, the German Jewish community had been, well, had the opportunity for the first time to assimil \u2014 well, to try and assimilate or at least to practice by choice, and the tendency was away from \u2014 from religious observations and to assimilate, to try and assimilate. So there were many Jews who felt primarily as Germans of Jewish faith. And I guess we were \u2014 my father ate treyf occasionally, because when he traveled he couldn\u2019t observe all th \u2014 so as a \u2014 as a boy, as a young man already, he stopped eating kosher as he did at home, and my mother the same way when she got out into daily life, modified, and 1t was called new kosher, neu- kosher.

Or to walk straight, to be \u2014 Jews were thought of as being non-athletic. My mother was very proud that we excelled in sports, my brother and I, and it was part of our \u2014 well, that we belonged, we were as good as they were. And well, it was odd that even my brother and I, during you know, Hitler times in high school, were allowed to participate in sporting events which in many other cities, Jews were no longer allowed to participate.

            "answer": "You can call it altercation, I call it a challenge of a fight. So after school I went home, or w-went to my \u2014 our store, and in the park, which was the \u2014 you know, in the \u2014 1s the \u2014 the French park. This guy was waiting with \u2014 of course, the word had spread, he\u2019s going to fight with Roberg, the Jew, whatever they had spread. And everybody was around, I took off my \u2014 my backpack, we had a Tornister it was called, a backpack. Took off my \u2014 my jacket and got into a fight. I\u2019d never fought in my life, but I knew what to do, I was interested in Schmeling and Sharkey and Joe Louis, I think was around already. So I knew about fighting. And we started squaring off and he landed some punches and I landed a lucky Sunday punch and bloodied his nose. So I was the first \u2014 first one to draw blood. Just then somebody hollered jute(ph), jute(ph), which does not mean Jew, but \u2014 although it\u2019s close to it. A teacher approached too late, now we weren\u2019t allowed to fight even \u2014 even in the park. And he came right to it, he says, what is this fighting, why are you fighting? I said, well he c \u2014 he called me juditsich(ph) and challenged me to a fight, I am fighting. So the teacher addressed the other boy and says, now that\u2019s not nice. You shouldn\u2019t say a thing like that. Now I want you to stop fighting and you both go home and that\u2019s the end of it. And that\u2019s how it was settled. So I came out the victor. The word apparently spread and I never had any problems after that. Interview with Kurt Roberg ie March 16, 2001"

And so we \u2014 and nearsighted, so he was limited in anything we did. Sunday \u2014 well, the routine, Sundays we would go for the traditional Sunday afternoon Spaziergang in the woods, whatever. Sometimes we would go on a boat ride on the river. But after 19 \u2014 let\u2019s say, well, after the Nuremberg laws of 1935, which was the first really restrictive, official restrictive, then I think that stopped. We could have gone \u2014 I mean, we went walking, but we no longer would go, let\u2019s say, using this excursion boat, which one of our neighbors \u2014 we lived right on the river, a-and they were a family of fishermen who also owned a little excursion steamer motorboat. So we no longer went. That was part of not raising any awareness and we really \u2014 and apparently we did it successfully in our town, because there was no open anti-Semitism that I was aware of. Others in town complained about anti-Semitism, only \u2014 you know, somebody would say something, was either as a matter of competition or neighbors who didn\u2019t like the n\u2014 the Jews next to them for one reason or another.

Kids I think everywhere, take sides. You have a favorite \u2014 well, sports idol and you have a political party of your choice. So kids would ask you, so what are you? And I wa \u2014 I would say, I\u2019m SPD \u2014 SPD riz \u2014 there was this Social Democratic party. What are you? I\u2019m NSDRP, it\u2019s a Nazi party, meaning they were what their parents were, right? I mean it \u2014 not hard to figure. The kids \u2014 children don\u2019t have opinions, they have the opinions of their parents. So that was reflected. So I went SPD and I remember we had a \u2014 what do we call it, Jahrmakt, a \u2014 a \u2014 a fair, a country fa-fi-fair, twice a year, in the spring and in the fall. And you go there and you \u2014 you know, and you \u2014 you had the stands and I bought a \u2014 as a matter of identification, the symbol of s \u2014 the SPD was three arrows. So I bought \u2014 I spent five cents and bought a pin so that I could have an identity. And I came home with that, and my mother says, what do you have? I said, aren\u2019t we SPD? And my mother said yes, but I think it\u2019s better if you Interview with Kurt Roberg \" March 16, 2001 don\u2019t wear that, because you can be something and you don\u2019t have to advertise it, because if somebody who sees and doesn\u2019t like it, you may get into an argument or a fight and you know the Nazis of course \u2014 well, the Nazi kids, they would stick together and the SPD kids would stick together. So these were little clubs. So I was aware of political things. I remember well in the \u2014 in the paper that there were street fights in Hamburg which was, of course, Hamburg was largely red, predominantly communist, because was a harbor city and of course everybody read about you know, the \u2014 what happened \u2014 what went on in Munich and in Berlin where the Nazis would ride around in trucks, have a demonstration and the communists would come and break it up and vice-a- versa. And they would let \u2014 and the SA, these storm \u2014 the SR then was the predominant power, the brown shirts and brown pants. The SS was not yet very predominant then. So SR would go around and these were bruisers. They were people who liked to fight. They were, you know, bouncers, they were bru \u2014 they would go out \u2014 they joined the party so they could get into a good fight just like people here go out on Saturday night, hey, let\u2019s go to a bar where we can have some action. Same mentality. So I was aware of that as a child, but there was a \u2014 you know, of course, a sobering effect from the home to say don\u2019t get involved and we have to, as Jews, be \u2014 lay low and you know, don\u2019t make waves."

And they \u2014 he went to the railroad station and took his hat and went begging, you know, with a blind man, you know, here\u2019s a blind man, please give the blind \u2014 and they got enough money together from Germans to go from Oranienburg to Berlin, and Hans\u2019s sister-in-law lived in Berlin. They went to the sister-in-law, her husband had of course also been taken but she was at home, and he bought enough money for the railroad fair for the two of them to come back to Celle.

And his body smelled from \u2014 you know, the only food that they got was \u2014 apparently the Germans took whale blubber and cooked that into a stew and that\u2019s what they got to eat, that and some potatoes. And most people couldn\u2019t eat it. Hans ate it, and whoever didn\u2019t want to, couldn\u2019t stomach this stuff. It smelled fa \u2014 and my father e-exuded this smell of whale blubber oil type. I mean, incred \u2014 I \u2014I\u2014I can smell it just thinking about it. And Hans was the only guy in the whole Oranienburg camp who gained weight, because he ate everybody el \u2014 what everybody else could \u2014 he was that kind of a guy. And then my father sat down and he cried. I had never seen my father cry, and he related the tortures that they had gone through. They had to stand at attention, now this was December, to stand at attention for six hours and if somebody dropped they weren\u2019t allowed to help them.

He wa \u2014 he \u2014 they had taken his glasses away from him, he was like a blind man. He didn\u2019t see it, but he heard it, of course. And he would \u2014 he would tal \u2014 and he never talked about anything, but he was talking about it, and who could listen to that? And he\u2019d break down and cry.

Now, we only had \u2014 we had relatives who lived in a suburb called Hillerhausberg(ph), and I decided to go there, but to go there I had to well, go through a railroad \u2014 go through a railroad underpass and of course the road was jammed with cars, but I was on a bicycle, there were a few other people on bicycles, you know, Holland is a \u2014 bicycle is a means of transportation and there weren\u2019t that many cars in 1940.

And then eventually, after I guess about four or five days after the fires were out we returned back to our address on Mauritsweg, and we found that the city was well, burned, the center of the city.

It turned out \u2014 I found out after \u2014 I visited this teacher, Dr. Riegerberg(ph) after the war when I came back to Germany, and I visited with him, and I found out then that he had a Jewish grandmother that some of his colleagues knew about, but nobody would tell.

So maybe I can, you know, look at that as a positive thing that came out of this. Anyway, by about July, August, the Germans were, of course, pre-preparing for the invasion of Great Britain. And whatever was afloat, they requisitioned. They were requisitioning every barge, every boat, every whatever. But is also showed to us and the Dutch that they really hadn\u2019t prepared \u2014 I think the war went so well for them, both in France and Belgium and in Holland, you know, they wiped out the allies and came to \u2014 to the North Sea and the channel, and really weren't prepared to invade \u2014 to invade England when the time was right.

So \u2014 no, but we wouldn't have spoken German for anything, so my corresponding was in \u2014 but I wrote everything in \u2014 well, we had a\u2014acode. This interesting point that you make. This is something that we had already developed while living in Germany. When \u2014 when we wrote from Germany, let\u2019s say to Holland or to relatives, we would write it in such a way that they understood what we were talking about but nobody else could. For instance, in Celle, the Interview with Kurt Roberg \u00b0* March 16, 2001 \u2014 the captain of the volunteer fire brigade, his name was Schnell, which happens to be quick, okay? Schnell. So I wrote on this postcard, we are well. Our old neighbor Herr Schnell had plenty of work for at least a week. So they knew how to interpret that, the censor didn\u2019t. So this is how we got the information across without, you know \u2014 anyway, it worked for us and I think all families had that. Or we would \u2014 we would refer to family members who were already somewhere else, you know. If \u2014 if we had a relative, let\u2019s say, in Switzerland, we would say Uncle S-Simon, you know, we were able to get in touch with Uncle Simon and send him something. Meaning we were able to send something to Switzerland, okay? So that\u2019s how we disguised information. I think that was pretty common. You just had to adapt to conditions, and you did. And it became actually, a sport to try to outwit the Germans. That was our mentality and it was also, that\u2019s what kept us going. Chronologically now I want to move on to \u2014 my uncle, of course, was trying desperately at that point to try and get me to America. Don\u2019t forget, America was still neutral. Then he found out in oh, about in October, November must have been, sometime in the fall of 1940 that someone in Holland tried to organize a children\u2019s transport to save or to reunite children who were left behind in Holland with parents who were already in America. [ only found out about 10 years ago when I was in \u2014 in Amsterdam at the war museum and archives, who this woman was. And that was Mrs. Wijsmuller.

He was \u2014 he was the contact, so we didn\u2019t just \u2014 you know, he was the contact, and we also in the group, the oldest person \u2014 oh, there were two, there was one woman, Judith, she was 17, and there was a fellow with whom I became very friendly, Jerry Cohen(ph) was 17. They were the \u2014 the senior people and they sort of, you know, took everybody\u2019s passport so that \u2014 there had to be an organization. They were in charge. Anyway, the first day, of Interview with Kurt Roberg \"\" March 16, 2001 course, within 24 hours, within Germany, certainly within Europe, when you move, you know, you have to register. When you leave Holland, whe-when I left Gouda, I had to go to the city hall and say, I\u2019m leaving, I\u2019m going to Berlin, I will be in Berlin, okay? And then when I \u2014 when we got to Berlin we had to say, we are now in Berlin, we come from Gouda, etcetera, records, you know, transfer every \u2014 and everything with stamps and so we had to go to the city police in Berlin and s-state that we were there for one week, we were staying at Grosse Hamburger Strasse and we were going \u2014 after one week we would go \u2014 you know, continue on to Lisbon, we were in transit. Fine, got permission to stay for seven days, no problem. But after seven days we did not have our transit visas for Spain. We needed transit visas for \u2014 well, France wasn\u2019t a problem, that was an occupied country. It\u2019s \u2014 the Germans were in charge, but Spain and Portugal were. And our passports were taken to \u2014 were taken to the Spanish consulate and they said oh, we will be glad to give you the visa, as soon as you have the Portuguese visa. What\u2019s the sense of giving you a Spanish, you don\u2019t even have the Portuguese? And unless we can be assured that you have the Portuguese so that you don\u2019t get stuck in Spain, we will give it to you. Went to the Portuguese. Of course we will give you Portuguese visa, as soon as you have the Spanish visa. What\u2019s the sense of giving you a Portuguese, you don\u2019t even have the Spanish? Get the Spanish and you will get the Portuguese, okay? Catch 22. We went back to the Spaniards and told them. And oh no, they\u2019re wrong, they \u2014 we will give you the \u2014 1t went back and forth. This took, of course, Interview with Kurt Roberg \u201c\u00b0 March 16, 2001 more than a week so after seven days we had to go back to the Berlin police to get an extension of our permit to stay. Now they got nasty, and they hollered at us in German. You\u2019re eating the bread that the German workers are entitled to. The implication was that if we didn\u2019t work, we wouldn't eat. Now we also had heard and we knew that once you were assigned as a labor force, if they put you into a factory, you were \u2014 became war essential. You could take your American visa and whatever, okay? You would never get your exit permit. So they gave us another one week extension. Now within that week we still did not have the papers. Now they said well, the \u2014 Berlin is not responsible for these papers, the American visa was issued in Holland. The \u2014 these people came from Holland, they should have gotten their Portuguese and Spanish transit visas in Holland, not in Berlin. So they took our passports and sent them back to Amsterdam. Now we were without identification. We got, I guess, a temporary, you know, bu \u2014 I \u2014I.D. card, whatever from the \u2014 from the \u2014 Berlin. Now we did not dare to, you know, go out or whatever. If we \u2014 if we would be caught without that \u2014 you know, you have to \u2014 you have to expl \u2014 well, we did go out, but only \u2014 things were very controlled in Berlin already at that time. The British would fly over and bomb occasionally. It was not \u2014 but they would come across, so there were air raids at night. The food was rationed, of course. And Jews had special ration coupons. Everything was by coupons and the Jewish coupons were stamped with a red J. Jews were only allowed to buy after four p.m. There was nothing left by four p.m. You go into a bakery, you took whatever \u2014 if they had anything left you Interview with Kurt Roberg \u201d\" March 16, 2001 took what, you know, didn\u2019t say well, I want a rye bread, you took whatever they had, right. Those were the conditions. Anyway, the Jewish congregation \u2014 and I\u2019m going to try and find out how they did that, had a \u2014 had a gimmick. They protected us from being assigned to the workforce, and it worked as follows. We were assigned as a workforce in Berlin Wannsee. Now, I don\u2019t know whether you know what Wannsee. Wannsee was there was a large estate which was \u2014 course had been Jewish, that was confiscated and had been made as a R and R retreat for the SS. They were still in the process of fixing that up and the Jewish congregation apparently had somehow managed to arrange that they will supply X number of workers every day. Let\u2019s say 50 workers for doing ground keeping etcetera. So now we were assigned twice a week to go out and work in Wannsee. The Gestapo out there didn\u2019t care who came. Now we were \u2014 we were briefed, we were told, you will see people in striped suits that are guarded by soldiers with guns. Don\u2019t even look at them, make no eye contact with anyone. Don\u2019t talk to anyone. Don\u2019t talk among each other other than necessary, even the people that you know. Do your work, keep your head down, mind your own business, don\u2019t make waves, okay? So, with those instructions we took the S-Bahn, the subway, the elevated out to Wannsee and we went to work, raking, cleaning up, whatever they told us to do. And now we had to go back after two weeks to the city police. What are you doing, you have been here \u2014 are you \u2014 what \u2014 we are working for Gestapo Wannsee. That\u2019s all they had to hear. We got our stamp. You can stay. We had the extension. And that\u2019s how they rotated people who Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Kurt Roberg \u201d March 16, 2001 were about to leave to protect them from being entered into the labor force. And I\u2019m going to try and find out in Berlin when I am there this spring if they know how they managed to do that. In the meantime, political things march on. Things in the Balkan weren\u2019t going too well. We were watching, of course the political or the \u2014 how the war developed. So far, for Germany everything went right.

I didn\u2019t have all that much time left. My American visa was issued January 31\u201c. It Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Kurt Roberg m March 16, 2001 expired May 31\u201c. By that time I had to be on the boat. So time was getting short for me, the other kids had maybe a week or two more, but not a lot. One day \u2014 well \u2014 how much time do you \u2014 how much time do you have left? So one day, it was, I guess end of April or so, and I was walking past a Woolworth and there wa \u2014 it is \u2014 was a Woolworth, there was a Woolworth in Berlin, and it was like 9:30 in the morning. And I saw that they had a big ad in the window, Thermosflaschen(ph), Thermos bottles. They had a special. So \u2014 but Thermos bottles in Germany weren\u2019t that easy to come by during the war. So my God, it\u2019s 9:30, I walked into this store. I would \u2014 and they were pretty cheap too, like four mark or something like that. I said yes, I would like some Thermos bottles, yes. I need 13. 13 Thermos bottles? Yes. He says, why do you need 13? I said, we\u2019re going on an excursion from school and you know, we \u2014 we all going and I need \u2014 of course I said this in perfect German. Are you sh \u2014 are you Aryan? Sind sie arisch? I said yes. He says, may I see your Ausweis? I said, I don\u2019t have an Ausweis, I have a passport. Let me see your passport. I said my passport is at the \u2014 at the German embassy. Are you sure you\u2019re Aryan? I said look, I am Auslandsdeutsche. Now I don\u2019t know whether you know what that it. Auslandsdeutsche they \u2014 in Germany they had a very special standing because they were the Germans, the Aryan, the good Germans, Aryan Germans who lived in the foreign countries, and Hitler \u2014 the system really sort of depended on them that if and when they moved in that they would support the German cause. So the Auslandsdeutsche was a status. I said, 1 am Auslandsdeutsche from Holland. I said, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Kurt Roberg \" March 16, 2001 I\u2019ve lived in Holland most of my life. My parents were German, but I lived in Holland and in Holland we don\u2019t know from Aryan or non-Aryan. I don\u2019t know what that means. Yeah, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re German. I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t sell you now. Now this 1s called chutzpah. I| said well, 1f you don\u2019t want to sell me now, at least will you save me 13 bottles so that when I come back at four ocl \u2014 he said, you have to come back after four o\u2019clock \u2014 when I come back after four o\u2019clock that I \u2014 that I can still get these? I really don\u2019t know why you don\u2019t want to sell me those now. Come back at four o\u2019clock. And I did. And she was not waiting with the police. She was decent. She sold me 13 bottles. Now, be \u2014 all my co-travelers were very happy because now we were prepared for our trip through France and Spain and Portugal. We at least could have hocked something. When I came to America and I told my mother that story, she almost died. How can you be so stupid? Well, that\u2019s \u2014 I took the chance and I had to try and get out of it as best I could, and you have to \u2014 you lived, or you survived or you didn\u2019t survive by your wits.

The people who had organized our trip had arranged for us to be overnight in San Sebastian and we stayed at the finest five star hotel, the Marie Louise, I think it is called, where we spent a glorious night and then went on by train, and as we were riding through the Spanish countryside, we really saw an appalling sight. Spain had just come out of the civil war which lasted what, four years, five years? And the people were devastated. We had hoarded bread for our trip because we had to take along food for five days.

All I can say is thank heaven he was legitimate. What we found out later, he could have been a German agent who posed as a free Dutch agent. Well, we spilled our guts. We told him what the Germans had done in Holland. We told him where the fortifications were in Berlin in the \u20141in the zoo area, Tiergarten and th-th-they had built high rise bunkers they call them, Interview with Kurt Roberg ia March 16, 2001 solid concrete.

The boat was still in port, so I went to bed, and \u2014 my bunk and next morning I got up at seven o\u2019clock, I went to see the sun rise over the ocean, I got up, we\u2019re still in Portugal. They\u2019re still loading cork. The Excambion was a combination freight and passengers. There were 180 passengers and n \u2014 thank heaven, one class. Da \u2014 did not have first and second or third class. So there were no ubermenschen and untermenschen, which was nice. But hey, I\u2019m on board, it\u2019s an American ship, I\u2019m on American territory, right, American grounds, under the American flag. I wasn\u2019t worried. So we finally left about nine o\u2019clock. They weighed anchor and off we went, stopped in Bermuda for six hours and well, 10 days later we arrived in the good old U.S.A., so I guess the customs people got on board out in the bay, Customs and \u2014 customs and immigration. So the last two hours as the ship steams 1n, they are Interview with Kurt Roberg ia March 16, 2001 processing everybody. So li \u2014 look at my passport, ah, sit over here. A couple of other people sat over there, most people could go again. And then finally he calls me back. Kurt Roberg? Yeah. Why are you trying to enter this country with an expired visa? I said, my visa was good when I came aboard ship. My visa expired at midnight. I was aboard ship at six p.m. According to the ship\u2019s log, this vessel sailed on June first. Your visa expired May 31. You can\u2019t come in. What do you mean I can\u2019t come in? I didn\u2019t say that, but I\u2014 we were taught to be humble, even in America. So, well, we docked in Hoboken, as was customary in those days. American export line docked in Hoboken, not in New York. And of course my mother knew \u2014 oh, I had \u2014 I had borrowed three dollars from a German speaking steward on board, to send a telegram from aboard ship to my mother that I was coming. She hadn\u2019t heard from me since I was in Berlin. I didn\u2019t write because every week we were supposed to leave and I was going to be there before the letters, right? So I didn\u2019t write. I wrote to my uncle, and he wrote to my mother and that\u2019s how she got word about what was happening with me, but I didn\u2019t write, and well, she went crazy \u2014 I mean, she understood, but why didn\u2019t you write? Anyway, so she was down on the pier and I was up on board. All the passengers were leaving the ship except me and one other woman, we stayed on board. Do you think they would have let my mother up, or me down? No, not in America. We waved, she cried. I guess I was teary- eyed. And I remember I s \u2014 I called to my mother, Mother, are you wearing lipstick? She says, yes, in America we \u2014 in America we wear lipstick. Because in Europe women \u2014 Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Kurt Roberg \u2122 March 16, 2001 hussies wore lipstick. My mother wearing lipstick, can you believe that? I said, before you know it you probably will \u2014 will paint your nails red, too. So those were the little \u2014 and that \u2014 that sort of stuck in my mind. Now anyway, my mother was told that I could not come down. We hollered up and down, you know, across the \u2014 and they told me that I'd have to go to Ellis Island for a hearing, just a formality. And my mother, of course, went the next day just for this formality and there was a hearing before a judge, and he looked at my papers and decided that well, they couldn\u2019t let me in. Now they \u2014 the visa was definitely expired. As a matter of fact, there was something wrong with the visa. The visa was issued on January 31\u00b0, it should have only gone to May 30\". They gave you an extra day, why? Oh, this will have to go to Washington, the State Department will have to handle that. And so it happened that Kurt Roberg stayed on Ellis Island for four weeks while they debated in Washington whether they could take a risk, the risk of letting me in, or whether they would send me back. And I guess lawyers came cheap in those days. American export lines had their lawyers working on it, because they would have had to pay another 210 dollars to take me back to Lisbon and obviously lawyers were paid a lot less than that in those days. So after four weeks they finally re \u2014 relented and \u2014 and they said, you can stay."

They were pretty desperate because they were starving, you know, Americans were \u2014 but the island was officially declared secured.

Now, since I\u2019m the person that doesn\u2019t like to take chances, I had seen to it that I had a few clips of ammunition that I had forgotten to turn in, just for insurance. And now we were \u2014 we were out on a\u2014 on a mission at night and we had a young lieutenant with us, someone we referred to as a shaved hair, that was second lieutenant just out of boot camp and whatever.

And we were \u2014 we didn\u2019t know what it was or who it was, but you have to assume that it is the enemy, right? I had passed the word to my two other colleagues that I had ammo, so we felt relatively comfortable. But the lieutenant didn\u2019t know, and he also had no ammo. So he said, do you think \u2014 do you think those are Japs? Lieutenant, we don\u2019t know, but when we find out we could probably arm wrestle them. So, you know, we found out that they had only 99 Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 raided our supply depot, the Japanese, they \u2014 they were hungry, they didn\u2019t want to fight.

I had a very interesting experience. As a matter of fact I [indecipherable] I went back to my hometown, Celle on the anniversary of Crystal Night in \u201998, 50\" anniversary and participated in a \u2014 well, I really instigated a memorial service at the synagogue in Celle, and I went over there for that and I was the keynote speaker. And I'll be glad to send you a copy of that speech. It was held in German, but I made a fairly accurate English translation for my congregation and for my friends. So Ill send you that, and you can put it into the records. But 1\u2014 I really \u2014 and I met with some of my former classmates for whom I would vouch that they were not Nazis then or now. And it was a very interesting experience and I think sort of telling. The \u2014 yeah, what went on under Hitler, how a lot of Germans who were, let\u2019s say scared into following the party line. Of course there was a meal ticket too, that they didn\u2019t dare to go across the \u2014 against the party line because it meant their livelihood. And I think there is really a lot of true democracy, especially in the young people. We \u2014 we read about the skinheads, the anti-Semitism, etcetera. But just like here, the good people don\u2019t make news, it\u2019s the bad people that make the news, and I think in our society too, you hear about the killings of \u2014 you know, the teenagers that are shooting up our schools and all that, but you don\u2019t read about the good kids or the kids that are scared. I met a little girl in Florida, she\u2019s 11 years old. There was a \u2014 well, talk 113 Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 about a \u2014 an incident in school and she was scared and she asked her mother, I don\u2019t want to go to school today because there\u2019s gonna be trouble. You know, there are \u2014 so what I\u2019m saying 1s there\u2019s good and bad everywhere. We don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t hear about the good kids, we only hear about the bad kids. And I think you as a \u2014 as an educator, know that that is so. To condemn a whole generation or sector of the population because of a few, is unfair. Any time you generalize, it\u2019s unfair, or even inaccurate. What\u2019s his name, Goldhagen? Every German is guilty? I haven\u2019t read his book. I read the synopsis in the \u201cNew York Times\u201d book review and all that. I don\u2019t want to read his book. He can come with statistics, but I don\u2019t think that every German down \u2014 deep down in his heart, felt anti-Semitic or was part \u2014 part-participated or wanted to participate. So he has a formula; that formula too, is not accurate. I think you have to take people as individuals and that\u2019s what I try to do. They\u2019re good and they\u2019re not so good and they\u2019 re outright bad. And n \u2014 that has been \u2014 I mean, I made my peace with Germany in 19 \u2014 in the 1950\u2019s, when I went back the first time on business with Hans Solomon(ph). We went back to Germany to try and do business in 1952. We went to the photo show in Cologne and we spent two weeks in Celle. Now he, being 15 years older than I, was there as an adult. He remem \u2014 knew a lot more people, and we looked up a lot of them and talked to them. Of course, in the 50\u2019s, nobody would know or admit that they knew anything. But we talked to people who said yes, we knew that Bergen-Belsen, which was 15 miles away from Celle, that 1t was there, but we didn\u2019t know what was going on. We \u2014 the man who was \u2014 114 Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 who supplied meat there, he went in there every couple of weeks, driving a truck in there, sure he saw. But he was told these are foreign Zwangsarbeiter, forced labor. But that they were systematically starved to death, or whatever, worked to death, he didn\u2019t know that. Nobody \u2014 nobody knew that other than the guards and the guards didn\u2019t tell, because it was self-incriminating. He supplied meats, he supplied food. Hey, we\u2019re taking food in there every week, you know. Whether \u2014 that this was only for the guards or whatever, nobody knew, right? So what I am \u2014 what I am saying is that we did talk about it. Ther- There was a death march where people were marched from the railroad 15 miles to the camp. And yes, some of the people saw it and even taunted the prisoners and whatever, you know, on the death \u2014 that came out later. Yes, but those people aren\u2019t going to talk about it or advertise it or admit it, even. They are the ones that say, we don\u2019t want to talk about the past any more, we want to lo \u2014 but the young Germans, who now \u2014 I mean \u2014 I mean the new, young generation, whose grandparents were the perpetrators, participants or silent participants, they are now asking, why did you keep quiet? How could you k- keep quiet? They don\u2019t understand how they could have \u2014 how their parents and grandparents could have kept quiet. And it\u2019s very hard in the 1990\u2019s, or 2000, to understand what the mentality was 50 years ago unless, you know the zeitgeist of the era, what the fears were, what the attitudes were and why people kept quiet. Why people didn\u2019t speak out. They were scared. The man I told you about who lived below us, the people who helped us on Crystal Night, he was a high official at the court, the Supreme Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 115 Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 Court. And he had the key for the ar \u2014 in \u2014 in the building, and up on \u2014 on the roof was a flag \u2014 you know, f \u2014 a \u2014a flagstaff. And when the Nazis took over, they went up there to pull down the red, white and blue flag to hoist the Nazi flag. And who has the key? Rusterfeld(ph) has the key, get Rusterfeld(ph), and they said, we want the key. I don\u2019t have the key. Well, give us the key or we\u2019ll break down the door. So he rummaged and he found the key. And as they stormed up there and up there, he was heard to mumble under his breath, I hope they break their neck. Somebody heard it and he was indicted and \u2014 that he made this remark. He had enough friends in the court system that witnesses came up and said oh no, you heard it wrong. He said, I hope they don\u2019t break their neck, because it was so dangerous to climb up there. They gave him the benefit of the doubt and he was permitted to retire earl \u2014 take early retirement, okay? Now, there were people like that, okay? And he was watched from there on and he couldn\u2019t afford to make a wrong move, but he didn't permit his daughters to ever join the Nazi party, for the girl they have the JungmAadel or whatever, the Hitler youth. He could have redeemed himself to prove that he was not against them by saying I want you to join, even if it\u2019s only pro forma. No, he stuck to his principles. There were people like that. So who\u2019s to say who is good and who\u2019s bad?"
