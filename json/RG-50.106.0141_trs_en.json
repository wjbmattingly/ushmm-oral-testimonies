            "question": "Now let\u2122s talk a little bit about your family. How far back can you trace the generations in this area of Germany.",
            "answer": "Well, that\u2122s a very interesting question and I will illustrate it by, well, telling you what happened to me. I \u0152 I went to a German school , as a matter of fact I was the only \u0152 during Hitler time already, from 1934 to 1938 to Kristallnacht, I was the only Jewish student in a s \u0152 s \u0152 student body of about 280 in a high school that was a [indecipherable] gymnasium. One of the assignments we had \u0152 now thas \u0152 this was about 1936, and Germany of course was very, a-as we would say, a \u0152 a roots \u0152 you know, tracing your roots. They were interested in genealogy. So one of our assignments in social studies was Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 4to trace our ancestry. How was I gonna trace my ancestry? My \u0152 I \u0152 ma \u0152 my mother contacted her sister, a maiden sister who lived with my \u0152 in my mother\u2122s home village, and contacted my father\u2122s maiden sister, who lived in my father\u2122s home village, and they both yeah, tried to do \u0152 trace our history. And Martha, which was the Roberg side of the family, got as far as great-grandfather, didn\u2122t get very far. And Aunt Babette(ph) of the Marx family, my mother\u2122s family near \u0152 in a village called Byetahl(ph) near Heidelberg was much more successful. She first traced the history back to 1871, which was written up in the local \u0152 what do we call it in German? Standes amt, the local village registry. Prior to that, all births and deaths were, even of the Jewish community were inter \u0152 entered in the church registry of the Catholic church. So she went to the priest and he, as a favor, for 10 mark or so, wrote out our whole genealogy and we were able to trace the f \u0152 Marx family back to 1741. So I drew up a family tree based on this information. This took about oh, a couple of months to get th at all written out by hand, turning the pages in the book and it became a matter of fascination for the priest himself. And I drew a \u0152 a family tree, and I turned it in and it turned out that Roberg, the only Jew in the class, could trace his ancestry in Germany back further than my 29 Christian stu \u0152 fellow students. And my teacher, who was very s-supportive, and nya \u0152 he was not a Nazi by any means, he made a point of it, to \u0152 yeah, tell the class that Roberg could trace his ancestry back further than any of the German boys. So it\u2122s a longwinded answer to your very brief question. Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 5"

            "question": "How many Jewish families tell a \u0152 out of a total population?",
            "answer": "Ah, it\u2122s a good question. We were a small Jewish congregation, but rather distinct. Celle, as you may or may not know, is of historic significance in that it was a m \u0152 the seat of a duke, Herzog, the Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg \u0152 Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, and so it was a white collar community. Our synagogue in Celle was built in 1741 and is today the on \u0152 the only survivin g synagogue in northern Germany that was \u0152 well, it was vandalized of course, but that survived, it was not burned or destroyed. It was destroyed from the inside, but the building remains. It was during my time, had of course gone past its peak, people had started moving away af ter World War I. Some families moved to Hannover , which was 40 kilometers. 25 miles away was the nearest large city, some moved to Berlin. The remaining active members in the community were about a dozen families. There were some Jewish people who were not active, they didn\u2122t attend services. They, I guess were Jews by religion on ly, or th-they \u0152 the Germans so nicely put it, Jewish citizens of a Hebrew faith or pe rsuasion. And that was by \u0152 by choice, they really didn't want to be identified with the Jewish community per se, and that was their choice. Give you an illustration, for \u0152 we only had services in our synagogue three times Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 8a year, on the high holidays, rush \u0152 you know, Passover and Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Well, Simchas Torah was observed, and you know, but we had trouble getting a minyan together, of course, and we were , by German standards Conservative, not Orthodox, but the synagogue of course was built, like m-m-most German synagogues with the women in \u0152 in the upper, on the ba lcony, whatever you call it, and the men downstairs and only me n counted for \u0152 yeah, for minyan. However, if you were 12 years old and you were gonna be Bar Mitzvahed the following year, you could already be counted as a minyan man. So it was that kind of a thing, or if things got very tough and we were nine, as a last resort they would say \u0152 we would send one of the boys, sometimes me, over to one of the non-observing Jews, one of them was Solomon \u0152 Solomon and say \u0152 ask Solomon if he\u2122ll come to minyan, you know, and then re luctantly and grumpily would come and di \u0152 um, sit in for minyan."

My father came from an Orthodox \u0152 well, an observant family. My father\u2122s family, it\u2122s a family of butchers, Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 9kosher butchers, but I guess the scene at the turn of the 20th century was really the \u0152 I\u2122m sure I\u2122m not telling you anything new, you know, the German Jewish community had been, well, had the opportunity for the first time to assimil \u0152 well, to try and assimilate or at least to practice by choice, and the tendency was away from \u0152 from religious observations and to assimilate, to try and a ssimilate. So there were many Jews who felt primarily as Germans of Jewish faith. And I guess we were \u0152 my father ate treyf occasionally, because when he traveled he couldn\u2122t observe all th \u0152 so as a \u0152 as a boy, as a young man already, he stopped eating kosher as he did at home, and my mother the same way when she got out into daily life, modified, and it was called new kosher, neu-kosher.

An d well, it was odd that even my brother and I, during you know, Hitler times in high school, were allowed to participate in sporting events which in many other cities, Jews were no longer allowed to participate.

This guy was waiting with \u0152 of course, the word had spread, he\u2122s going to fight with Roberg , the Jew, whatever they had spread. And everybody was around, I took off my \u0152 my backpack, we had a Tornister it was called, a backpack. Took off my \u0152 my jacket and got into a fight . I\u2122d never fought in my life, but I knew what to do, I was interested in Schmeling and Sharkey and Joe Louis, I think was around already. So I knew about fighting. And we started squaring off and he landed some punches and I landed a lucky Sunday punch and bloodied his nose. So I was the first \u0152 first one to draw blood. Just then somebody hollered jute(ph), jute(ph), which does not mean Jew, but \u0152 although it\u2122s close to it. A teacher approached too late, now we weren\u2122t allowed to fight even \u0152 even in the park. And he came right to it, he says, what is this fighting, why are you fighting? I said, well he c \u0152 he called me juditsich(ph) and challenged me to a fight, I am fighting. So the teacher addressed the other boy and says, now that\u2122s not nice. You shouldn\u2122t say a thing like that. Now I want you to stop fighting and you both go home and that\u2122s the end of it. And that\u2122s how it was settled. So I came out the victor. The word apparently spread and I never had any problems after that. Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 16"

And so we \u0152 and nearsighted, so he was limited in anything we did. Sunday \u0152 well, the routine, Sundays we would go for the traditional Sunday afternoon Spaziergang in the woods, whatever. Sometimes we would go on a boat ride on the river. But after 19 \u0152 let\u2122s say, well, after the Nuremberg laws of 1935, which was the first really restrictive, official restrictive, then I think that stopped. We could have gone \u0152 I mean, we went walking, but we no longer would go, let\u2122s say, using this excursion boat, which one of our neighbors \u0152 we lived right on the river, a-and they were a family of fishermen who also owned a little excursion steamer motorboat. So we no longer went. That was part of not raising any awareness and we really \u0152 and apparently we did it successfully in our town, because there was no open anti-Semitism that I was aware of. Others in town complained about anti-Semitism, only \u0152 you know, somebody would say something, was either as a matter of competition or neighbors who didn\u2122t like the n \u0152 the Jews ne xt to them for one reason or another. But there really was very little and it \u0152 we used to almost brag about it, you know, to other Jewish families, that we had no richiss(ph) \u0152 there was no anti-Semitism \u0152 open anti-Semitism in our town Nobody was ever beat en up, intimidated or you know, I mean \u0152 and you could \u0152 anything could \u0152 could happen. Like a Hitler youth would see a Jewish Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 17man coming down the street and bump into him, you know, why don\u2122t you watch where you\u2122re going, or you know, walk in the gutter, or you know, make anti-Semitic remark and of course you couldn\u2122t do anyt hing about it.

Kids I think everywhere, take sides. You have a favorite \u0152 well, sports idol and you have a political party of your choice. So kids would ask you, so what are you? And I wa \u0152 I would say, I\u2122m SPD \u0152 SPD riz \u0152 there was this Social Democratic party. What are you? I\u2122m NSDRP, it\u2122s a Nazi party, meaning they were what their parents were, right? I mean it \u0152 not hard to figure. The kids \u0152 children don\u2122t have opinions, they have the opinions of their parents. So that was reflected. So I went SPD and I remember we had a \u0152 what do we call it, Jahrmakt , a \u0152 a \u0152 a fair, a country fa-fi-fair, twice a year, in the spring and in the fall. And you go there and you \u0152 you know, and you \u0152 you had the stands and I bought a \u0152 as a matter of identification, the symbol of s \u0152 the SPD was three arrows. So I bought \u0152 I spent five cents and bought a pin so that I could have an identity. And I came home with that, and my mother says, what do you have? I said, aren\u2122t we SPD? And my mother said yes, but I think it\u2122s better if you Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 18don\u2122t wear that, because you can be something and you don\u2122t have to advertise it, because if somebody who sees and doesn\u2122t like it, you may get into an argument or a fight and you know the Nazis of course \u0152 well, the Nazi kids, they would stick together and the SPD kids would stick together. So these were little clubs. So I was aware of political things. I remember well in the \u0152 in the paper that there were street fights in Hamburg which was, of course, Hamburg was largely red, predominantly communist, because was a harbor city and of course everybody read about you know, the \u0152 what happened \u0152 what went on in Munich and in Berlin where the Nazis would ride around in trucks, have a demonstration and the communists would come and break it up and vice-aversa. And they would let \u0152 and the SA, these storm \u0152 the SR then was the predominant power, the brown shirts and brown pants. The SS was not yet very predominant then. So SR would go around and these were bruisers. They were people who liked to fight. They were, you know, bouncers, they were bru \u0152 they would go out \u0152 they joined the party so they could get into a good fight just like people here go out on Saturday night, hey, let\u2122s go to a bar where we can have some action. Same mentality. So I was aware of that as a child, but there was a \u0152 you know, of course, a sobering effect from the home to say don\u2122t get involved and we have to, as Jews, be \u0152 lay low and you know, don\u2122t make waves."

Now at this time, 1936, to go back to what you asked about Zioni sm, we did have classes twice a week on Wednesdays.

They were impressed with what was being done there and from there on he really said, well we have to \u0152 we have to support Palestine, Zionism is our solution. And we listened.

During that time, in August, of course, you know that every year the Nazis in August had the Nuremberger(ph) Parteitag, the party convention.

We moved \u0152 it so happened that our landlord, the owner of our house, it was a three family house, we lived on the \u0152 they lived on the ground floor, the first floor was a retired lawyer, he was a person that was working at the \u0152 the law \u0152 the supreme \u0152 there were three Supreme Courts in Germany , one of them was in Celle.

So we no longer had a store since 1937.

I don\u2122t know, I don\u2122t remember whether he phoned or whatever. I doubt it. We weren\u2122t a telephone oriented and we couldn\u2122t trust the telephone. My father was released on December 16th from Oranienburg together with Hans Solomon , who was this \u0152 the younger man, the family that we were friendly with. Of course, all the German \u0152 th-the Jews from Celle were sent to the same camp, Oranienburg . And I think Lotheim had already been released a week earlier, but I couldn\u2122t be sure, because he was \u0152 he was in his 70\u2122s. Hans and my father came out, as I say, on the 16th. They were just discharged and Hans was a \u0152 in his early 30\u2122s then, he was very inventive, he\u2122s a sharp guy. And my father, you know, was nearly blind, so they took the old \u0152 the hat that \u0152 that they were Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 43getting in \u0152 giving \u0152 all their clothes had been disinfected and just rolled in a ball, they were crumpled and smelled from this disinfec tant, I can smell it today. And they \u0152 he went to the railroad station and took his hat and went begging, you k now, with a blind man, you know, here\u2122s a blind man, please give the blind \u0152 and they got enough money together from Germans to go from Oranienburg to Berlin, and Hans\u2122s sister-in-law lived in Berlin. They went to the sister-in-law, her husband had of course also been taken but she was at home, and he bought enough money for the railroad fair for the two of them to come back to Celle. And then they walked in and I remember my father coming in, his \u0152 well, he didn\u2122t have much hair, but the head was completely shaved and this horrible smell of the disinfectant. And his body smelled from \u0152 you know, the only food that they got was \u0152 apparently the Germans took whale blub ber and cooked that into a stew and that\u2122s what they got to eat, that and some potatoes. And most people couldn\u2122t eat it. Hans ate it, and whoever didn\u2122t want to, couldn\u2122t stomach this stuff. It smelled fa \u0152 and my father e-exuded this smell of whale blubber oil type. I mean, incred \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I can smell it just thinking about it. And Hans was the only guy in the whole Oranienburg camp who gained weight, because he ate every body el \u0152 what everybody else could \u0152 he was that kind of a guy. And then my father sat down and he cried. I had never seen my father cry, and he related the tortures that they had gone through. They had to stand at attention, now this was December, to stand at attention for six hours and if somebody dropped they weren\u2122t allowed to help them. And just, you know, the bunks, that was Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 44where they slept over there, wer \u0152 where they \u0152 and how they were well, humiliated and somebody broke an infraction, everybody \u0152 everybody out to witness how they were put aufbuch (ph) that was \u0152 it was a \u0152 a wooden whatever, gadget, where they were strung up, I guess, spread eagle and whipped 25 lashes in front of everybody. Or 50, whatever \u0152 whatever the leader of \u0152 you know, and people were dropping and collapsing and watching that. And I guess luckily my father couldn\u2122t see too much. He wa \u0152 he \u0152 they had taken his glasses away from him, he was like a blind man. He didn\u2122t see it, but he heard it, of course. And he wo uld \u0152 he would tal \u0152 and he never talked about anything, but he was talking about it, and who could lis ten to that? And he\u2122d break down and cry. And I left then, a week later, on the twe \u0152 December 24th, I left for Holland. Now here\u2122s again a little well, incidence of the spirit that we had.

Now, we only had \u0152 we had relatives who lived in a suburb called Hillerhausberg (ph), and I decided to go there, but to go there I had to well, go through a railroad \u0152 go through a railroad underpass and of course the road was jammed with cars, but I was on a bicycle, there were a few other people on bicycles, you know, Holland is a \u0152 bicycle is a means of transportation and ther e weren\u2122t that many cars in 1940.

And they protected him until 1944 when the director of the school thought it was best if he would take early retirement, just to protect him.

So maybe I can, you know, look at that as a po sitive thing that came out of this. Anyway, by about July, August, the Germans were, of course, pre-preparing for the invasion of Great Britain. And whatever was afloat, they requisitioned. They were requisitioning every barge, every boat, every whatever. But is also showed to us and the Dutch that they really hadn\u2122t prepared \u0152 I think the war went so well for them, both in France and Belgium and in Holland, you know, they wiped out the allies and came to \u0152 to the North Sea and the channel, and really weren' t prepared to invade \u0152 to invade England when the time was right.

So \u0152 no, but we wouldn't have spoken German for anything, so my corresponding was in \u0152 but I wrote everything in \u0152 well, we had a \u0152 a code. This interesting point that you make. This is something that we had already developed while living in Germany . When \u0152 when we wrote from Germany, let\u2122s say to Holland or to relatives, we would write it in such a way that they understood what we were talking about bu t nobody else could. For instance, in Celle, the Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 62\u0152 the captain of the volunteer fire brigade, his name was Schnell, which happens to be quick, okay? Schnell. So I wrote on this postcard, we are well. Our old neighbor Herr Schnell had plenty of work for at least a week. So they knew how to interpret that, the censor didn\u2122t. So this is how we got the information across without, you know \u0152 anyway, it worked for us and I think all families had that. Or we would \u0152 we would refer to family members who were already somewhere else, you know. If \u0152 if we had a relative, let\u2122s say, in Switzerland , we would say Uncle S-Simon, you know, we were able to get in touch with Uncle Simon and send him something. Meaning we were able to send something to Switzerland, okay? So that\u2122s how we disguised information. I think that was pretty common. You just had to adapt to conditions, and you did. And it became actually, a sport to try to outwit the Germans. That was our mentality and it was also, that\u2122s what kept us going. Chronologically now I want to move on to \u0152 my uncle, of course, was trying desperately at that point to try and get me to America. Don\u2122t forget, America was still neutral. Then he found out in oh, about in October, November must have been, sometime in the fall of 1940 that someone in Holland tried to organize a children\u2122s transport to save or to reunite children who were left behind in Holland with parents who were already in America. I only found out about 10 years ago when I was in \u0152 in Amsterdam at the war museum and archives, who this woman was. And that was Mrs. Wijsmuller. She was \u0152 and my uncle found out about it because her husband was a shipping magnate. He \u0152 he ow ned steamships. And my uncle was, you know, dealt with Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 63steamship companies, being in the grain business.

They were the \u0152 the senior people and they sort of, you know, took everybody\u2122s passport so that \u0152 there had to be an organization. They were in charge. Anyway, the first day, of Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 67course, within 24 hours, within Germany, certainly within Europe , when you move, you know, you have to register. When you leave Holland, whe-when I left Gouda, I had to go to the city hall and say, I\u2122m leaving, I\u2122m going to Berlin, I will be in Berlin, okay? And then when I \u0152 when we got to Berlin we had to say, we are now in Berlin, we come from Gouda , etcetera, records, you know, transfer every \u0152 and everything with stamps and so we had to go to the city police in Berlin and s-state that we were there for one week, we were staying at Grosse Hamburger Strasse and we were goi ng \u0152 after one week we would go \u0152 y ou know, continue on to Lisbon, we were in transit. Fine, got permission to stay for seven days, no problem. But after seve n days we did not have our transit visas for Spain . We needed transit visas for \u0152 well, France wasn\u2122t a problem, that was an occupied country. It\u2122s \u0152 the Germans were in charge, but Spain and Portugal were. And our passports were taken to \u0152 were taken to the Spanish consulate and they said oh, we will be glad to give you the vi sa, as soon as you have the Portuguese visa. What\u2122s the sense of giving you a Spanish, you don\u2122t even have the Portuguese? And unless we can be assured that you have the Portuguese so that you don\u2122t get stuck in Spain, we will give it to you. Went to the Portuguese. Of course we will give you Portuguese visa, as soon as you have the Span ish visa. What\u2122s the sense of giving you a Portuguese, you don\u2122t even have the Spanish? Get the Spanish and you will get the Portuguese, okay? Catch 22. We went back to the Spaniards and told them. And oh no, they\u2122re wrong, they \u0152 we will give you the \u0152 it went back and forth. This took, of course, Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 68more than a week so after seven days we had to go back to the Berlin police to get an extension of our permit to stay. Now they got nasty, and they hollered at us in German. You\u2122re eating the bread that the German workers are entitled to. The implication was that if we didn\u2122t work, we wouldn't eat. Now we also had heard and we knew that once you were assigned as a labor force, if they put you into a factory, you were \u0152 became war essential. You could take y our American visa and whatev er, okay? You would never get your exit permit. So they gave us another on e week extension. Now within that week we still did not have the papers. Now they said well, the \u0152 Berlin is not responsible for these papers, the American visa was issued in Holland. The \u0152 these people came from Holland, they should have gotten their Portuguese and Spanish transit visas in Holland, not in Berlin. So they took our passports and sent them back to Amsterdam. Now we were without identification. We got, I guess, a temporary, you know, bu \u0152 I \u0152 I.D. card, whatever from the \u0152 from the \u0152 Berlin. Now we did not dare to, you know, go out or whatever. If we \u0152 if we would be caught with out that \u0152 you know, you have to \u0152 you have to expl \u0152 well, we did go out, but only \u0152 things were very controlled in Berlin already at that time. The British would fl y over and bomb occasionally. It was not \u0152 but they would come across, so there were air raids at night. The food was rationed, of course. And Jews had special ration coupons. Everything was by coupons and the Jewish coupons were stamped with a red J. Jews were only allowed to buy after four p.m. There was nothing left by four p.m. You go into a bakery, you took whatever \u0152 if they had anything left you Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 69took what, you know, didn\u2122t sa y well, I want a rye bread, you took whatever they had, right. Those were the conditions. Anyway, th e Jewish congregation \u0152 and I\u2122m going to try and find out how they did that, had a \u0152 had a gimmick. They protected us from being assigned to the workforce, and it worked as follows. We were assigned as a workforce in Berlin Wannsee. Now, I don\u2122t know whether you know what Wannsee. Wannsee was there was a large estate which was \u0152 course had been Jewish, that was confiscated and had been made as a R and R retreat for the SS. They were still in the process of fixing that up and the Jewish congregation apparen tly had somehow managed to arrange that they will supply X number of workers every day. Let\u2122 s say 50 workers for doing ground keeping etcetera. So now we were assigned twice a week to go out and work in Wannsee. The Gestapo out there didn\u2122t care who came. Now we were \u0152 we were briefed, we were told, you will see people in striped suits that are guarded by soldiers with guns. Don\u2122t even look at them, make no eye contact with anyone. Don\u2122t talk to anyone. Don\u2122t talk among each other other than necessary, even the people that you know. Do your work, keep your head down, mind your own bu siness, don\u2122t make waves, okay? So, with those instructions we took the S-Bahn, the subway, the elevated out to Wannsee and we went to work, raking, cleaning up, whatever they told us to do. And now we had to go back after two weeks to the city police. What are you doing, you have been here \u0152 are you \u0152 what \u0152 we are working for Gestapo Wannsee. That\u2122s all they had to hear. We got our stamp. You can stay. We had the extensio n. And that\u2122s how they rotated people who Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 70were about to leave to protect them from being entered into the labor force. And I\u2122m going to try and find out in Berlin when I am there this spring if they know how they managed to do that. In the meantime, political things march on. Things in the Balkan weren\u2122t going too well. We were watching, of course the political or the \u0152 how the war developed. So far, for Germany everything went right. Italy started to invade Albany, Albany couldn\u2122t be invaded."

By this time it was April and we said oh well, if the war expands, maybe we\u2122ll never get out. And we still didn\u2122t have our papers. They were still haggling in Amsterdam and Berlin.

Now it was \u0152 finally, by the end of April we said well, we are getting our papers, and we did get our papers finally, and now we were preparing, we were told the trip takes five days. You will leave on \u0152 maybe in two or three weeks you will be able to get on the train. And I was telling them my, you know, my visa \u0152 my visa expired May 31st. I didn\u2122t have all that much time left. My American visa was issued January 31st. It Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 71expired May 31st. By that time I had to be on the boa t. So time was getting short for me, the other kids had maybe a week or two more , but not a lot. One day \u0152 well \u0152 how much time do you \u0152 how much time do you have left ? So one day, it was, I guess end of April or so, and I was walking past a Woolworth and there wa \u0152 it is \u0152 was a Woolworth, there was a Woolworth in Berlin, and it was like 9:30 in the morning. And I saw that they had a big ad in the window, Thermosflaschen(ph), Thermos bottles. They had a special. So \u0152 but Thermos bottles in Germany weren\u2122t that easy to come by during the war. So my God, it\u2122s 9:30, I walked into this store. I would \u0152 and they were pretty cheap too, like four mark or something like that. I said yes, I would like some Thermos bottles, yes. I need 13. 13 Thermos bottles? Yes. He says, why do you need 13? I said, we\u2122re going on an excursion from sc hool and you know, we \u0152 we all going and I need \u0152 of course I said this in perfect German. Are you sh \u0152 are you Aryan? Sind sie arisch? I said yes. He says, may I see your Ausweis? I said, I don\u2122t have an Ausweis, I have a passport. Let me see your passport. I said my passport is at the \u0152 at the German embassy. Are you sure you\u2122re Aryan? I said look, I am Auslandsdeutsche. Now I don\u2122t know whether you know what that it. Auslandsdeutsche they \u0152 in Germany they had a very special standing because they were the Germans, the Aryan, the good Germans, Aryan Germans who lived in the foreign countries, and Hitler \u0152 the system really sort of depended on them that if and when they moved in that they would sup port the German cause. So the Auslandsdeutsche was a status. I said, I am Auslandsdeutsche from Holland. I said, Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 72I\u2122ve lived in Holland most of my life. My parents were German, but I lived in Holland and in Holland we don\u2122t know from Aryan or non-Aryan. I don\u2122t know what that means. Yeah, I don\u2122t think you\u2122re German. I\u2122m sorry, I can\u2122t sell you now. Now this is called chutzpah. I said well, if you don\u2122t want to sell me now, at least will you save me 13 bottles so that when I come back at four ocl \u0152 he said, you have to come back after four o\u2122clock \u0152 when I come back afte r four o\u2122clock that I \u0152 that I can still get these? I really don\u2122t know why you don\u2122t want to sell me thos e now. Come back at four o\u2122clock. And I did. And she was not waiting with the police. She was decent. She sold me 13 bottles. Now, be \u0152 all my co-travelers were very happy because now we we re prepared for our trip through France and Spain and Portugal. We at least could have hocked something. When I came to America and I told my mother that story, she almost died. How can you be so stupid? Well, that\u2122s \u0152 I took the chance and I had to try and get out of it as best I could, and you have to \u0152 you lived, or you survived or you didn\u2122t survive by your wits. And that\u2122s \u0152 that was the point of growing up under these conditions. Anyway, we had our Thermos bottles, we were ready to go and we were preparing, and on May 11th, Rudolf Hess decided to fly to England . Rudolf Hess of course was Stellvertreter des F\u00fchrers, and we thought this is the end, we\u2122re no \u0152 never going to get out. Well luckily, the Germans played it down, they didn\u2122t make a big deal of it, it was in the paper one day and he was out of his mind, it was \u0152 well, whatever. He tried to \u0152 however they explained it and the newspapers will tell you how. And it did not change the foreign policy toward Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 73America, which was still neutral. And on May 19th, we left Berlin. We were sealed into a railroad car, third class. This was a regular, you know, railroad car."

Th e people who had organized our trip had arranged for us to be overnight in San Sebasti\u00e1n and we stayed at the finest five star hotel, the Marie Louise, I think it is called, where we spent a glorious night and then went on by train, and as we were riding through the Spanish countryside, we really saw an appalling sight. Spain had just come out of the civil war which lasted what, four years, five years? And the people were devastated. We had hoarded bread for our trip because we had to take along food for five days. We were locked into a \u0152 into a car and we knew there was no food in \u0152 in Spain, so this was our third day.

We arrived in Lisbon and we were put up by the Jewish community there m \u0152 or the organization that wa s sponsoring our trip, assumably the HIAS. We were put up in a pensionne and we had a very interesting experience. About the day after we arrived, a man came to our pensionne and said, I am from the free Dutch government in London.

So we met the following day, it was about six o\u2122cl ock at night. I and two other boys, Jerry Cohen(ph), who was fluent in Dutch and on e other boy. And first we went to a restaurant, caf \u0152 caf\u00e9 on the main square in Lisbon and he ordered coffee for us, and oh, we were glad to have real coffee after that bilge water we \u0152 we got in Germany. And then he said, don\u2122t turn around but I don\u2122t think we can talk here because there is an \u0152 an foreign agent sitting at another table, watching us. We better leave here.

All I can say is thank heaven he was legitimate. What we found out later, he could have been a German agent who posed as a free Dutch agent. Well, we spilled our guts. We told him what the Germans had done in Holland. We told him where the fortifications were in Berlin in the \u0152 in the zoo area, Tiergarten and th-th-they had built high rise bunkers they call them, Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 80solid concrete. And where the anti-aircraft guns were agains \u0152 you know, when the British came o \u0152 flying over, we spilled our guts and felt very good about it, that we could finally do something.

You know, the Tiergarten, which is the \u0152 the zoo or the park area, they had built bunkers there because they were \u0152 because it was \u0152 they were protected by the trees and were, you know, camouflaged, natural camouflage. And we ll, we just told them what we knew about what they were doing in \u0152 in Holland, that they had tried to, you know, build a fleet which \u0152 etcetera, etcetera. And \u0152 and well, there was that and then as time got near I went, of course, speaking for my ow \u0152 my own interests, I went to the American export lines and told them that I was here. I had my cable showing that my mother had paid. I had missed the March 15 th, I had not taken advantage of the payment. You have a payment, and I\u2122m here now and I\u2122ve got to le ave. I knew that the next ship was leaving on March 30th. The Excambion, one of their lines. And yes, I said, well I have to be on Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 81that ship, and \u0152 okay, don\u2122t wo rry, I se \u0152 so starting on the 27th, I went to the office eight o\u2122clock in the morning and I said I would like to see the passenger list. Don\u2122t worry, you\u2122ll be on the \u0152 I said, I want to see the passenger list. Well, we don\u2122t have it yet. So I sat there all day and waited and \u0152 and I had no other pl ace to go. And on the 29th, it was getting a little closer, don\u2122t worry, you\u2122ll be on the ship, and you know \u0152 anyway, they \u0152 they gave me a song and a dance, and let me see the \u0152 I said, you can see it but you can\u2122t have it. It was my only receipt. And this went until the 30th, and then on the 30th, said, well, the ship isn\u2122t sailing until tomorrow, which was May 31st. I say, you\u2122re sure it\u2122s sai \u0152 yes, i \u0152 tomorrow. Well anyway, they gave me their \u0152 you know , delayed me again. They never came across with the passenger list. And I talked to the guy from the Jewish committee and he said, you\u2122ll be on the list, don\u2122t worry, you\u2122ll be \u0152 you\u2122ll make it. Then, on the \u0152 he said, yet \u0152 look, tomorrow mornin g you go to the pier \u0152 and I had to borrow money because we were onl y allowed 10 mark out of Germany , which was soon gone. I borrowed money from one of my fellow trav elers and that \u0152 luckily the fares in Portugal were very cheap, so I got to the pier and I was standing there waiting. I got there about two o\u2122clock in the afternoon w ith all the other refugees and we were \u0152 I was standing in the sun. Here it was the end of May and I was wearing my winter clothes that I had left Holland with in March. Not good. And well, this guy finally \u0152 our guy showed up about four, 4:30, climbs up on a crate and starts calling out names of re fugees. The Americans were going up the gangplank, you know, like Americans do, and the refugees were Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 82standing in the sun.

So finally like the third last name, Roberg, Kurt. Well, by this time it was six o\u2122clock. I flew up that gangplank and I was on my way, so I th ought. So, wait til about 10 o\u2122clock, this boat was \u0152 it was supposed to leave at six. The boat was still in port, so I went to bed, and \u0152 my bunk and next morning I got up at seven o\u2122clock, I went to see the sun rise over the ocean, I got up, we\u2122re still in Portugal. They\u2122re still loading cork. The Excambion was a combination freight and passengers. There were 180 passengers and n \u0152 thank heaven, one class. Da \u0152 did not have first and second or third class. So there were no \u00fcbermenschen and untermenschen, which was nice. But hey, I\u2122m on board, it\u2122s an American ship, I\u2122m on American territory, right, American grounds, under the American flag. I wasn\u2122t worried. So we finally left about nine o\u2122clock. They weighed anchor and off we went, stopped in Bermuda for six hours and well, 10 days later we arrived in the good old U.S.A., so I guess the customs people got on board out in the bay, Customs and \u0152 customs and immigration. So the last tw o hours as the ship steams in, they are Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 83processing everybody. So li \u0152 look at my passport, ah, sit over here. A couple of other people sat over there, most people could go again. And then finally he calls me back. Kurt Roberg? Yeah. Why are you trying to enter this country with an expired visa? I said, my visa was good when I came aboard ship. My visa expired at midnight. I was aboard ship at six p.m. According to the ship \u2122s log, this vessel sailed on June first. Your visa expired May 31 st. You can\u2122t come in. What do you mean I can\u2122t come in? I didn\u2122t say that, but I \u0152 we were taught to be humble, even in America. So, well, we docked in Hoboken, as was customary in those days . American export line docked in Hoboken, not in New York. And of course my mother knew \u0152 oh, I had \u0152 I had borrowed three dollars from a German speaking steward on board, to send a telegram from aboard ship to my mother that I was coming. She hadn\u2122t heard from me since I was in Berlin. I didn\u2122t write because every week we were supposed to leave and I was going to be there before the letters, right? So I didn\u2122t write. I wrote to my uncle, and he wrote to my mother and that\u2122s how she got word about what was happening with me, but I didn\u2122t write, and well, she went crazy \u0152 I mean, she understood, but why didn\u2122t you write? Anyway, so she was down on the pier and I was up on board. All th e passengers were leaving the ship except me and one other woman, we stayed on boar d. Do you think they would have let my mother up, or me down? No, not in America. We waved, she cried. I guess I was tearyeyed. And I remember I s \u0152 I called to my mother, Mother, are you wearing lipstick? She says, yes, in America we \u0152 in America we wear lipstick. Because in Europe women \u0152 Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 84hussies wore lipstick. My mother wearing lip stick, can you believe that? I said, before you know it you probably will \u0152 will paint your nails red, too. So those were the little \u0152 and that \u0152 that sort of stuck in my mind. Now anyway, my mother was told that I could not come down. We hollered up and down, you know, across the \u0152 and they told me that I\u2122d have to go to Ellis Island for a hearing, just a formality. And my mother, of course, went the next day just for this formality and there was a hearing before a judge, and he looked at my papers and decided that well, th ey couldn\u2122t let me in. Now they \u0152 the visa was definitely expired. As a matter of fact, there was something wrong with the visa. The visa was issued on January 31st, it should have only gone to May 30 th. They gave you an extra day, why? Oh, this will have to go to Washington, the State Department will have to handle that. And so it happened that Kurt Roberg stayed on Ellis Island for four weeks while they debated in Washington whether they could take a risk, the risk of letting me in, or whether they would send me back. And I guess lawyers came cheap in those days. American export lines had their lawyers working on it, because they would have had to pay another 210 do llars to take me back to Lisbon and obviously lawyers were paid a lot less than that in those days. So after four weeks they finally re \u0152 relented and \u0152 and they said, you can stay."

So every Sunday, when my mother came from New Rochelle , we spent in the basement seeing to it that \u0152 spraying roach stuff and whatever, that we wouldn\u2122t get any roaches into the furniture, into the mattre \u0152 into whatever.

And went to a lot of movies on Saturday morning for 17 cents, to learn English. That\u2122s how you learned English. And then as \u0152 Sunday we were in the basement, when about 2:30 we heard about the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor and then we heard Roosevelt, so I know exactly where I was. And we were \u0152 well, we were glad."

So, you know, I knew that, and thi \u0152 it was true in America, and you know, we \u0152 we heard and learned that well, you can \u0152 that in certain businesses and banks you can\u2122t \u0152 you know, you can\u2122t go into the banking business, you can\u2122t go into the \u0152 at the time, that that was \u0152 those were businesses or professions where Jews were not welcome."

And we were \u0152 we didn\u2122t know what it was or who it was, but you have to assume that it is the enemy, right? I had passed the word to my two other colleagues that I had ammo, so we felt relatively comfortable. But the lieutenant didn\u2122t know, and he also had no ammo. So he said, do you think \u0152 do you think those are Japs? Lieutenant, we don\u2122t know, but when we find out we could probably arm wres tle them.

By the same token my wife, who grew up in wartime Germany, and she was five years younger, so she had to leave eastern Germany when the Russians came, as a small child.

            "answer": "Yes, I \u0152 well, I-I\u2122m certainly more aware of it, but I\u2122m also aware of the abuses and of the limitations and it\u2122s interesting that I\u2122ve gone back to Germany many times and the change I see in Germany today, the change toward democr acy is really remarkable. I had a very interesting experience. As a matter of fact I [indecipherable] I went back to my hometown, Celle on the anniversary of Crystal Night in \u212298, 50th anniversary and participated in a \u0152 well, I really instigated a memorial service at the synagogue in Celle, and I went over there for that and I was the keynote speaker. And I\u2122ll be glad to send you a copy of that speech. It was held in German, but I made a fairly accurate English translation for my congregation and for my friends. So I\u2122ll send you that, and you can put it into the records. But i \u0152 I really \u0152 and I met with some of my former classmates for whom I would vouch that they were not Nazis then or now. And it was a very interesting experience and I think sort of telling. The \u0152 yeah, what went on under Hitler, how a lot of Germans who were, let\u2122s say scared into following the party line. Of course there was a meal ticket too, that they didn\u2122t dare to go across the \u0152 against the party line because it meant their livelihood. And I think there is really a lot of true democracy, especially in the young people. We \u0152 we read about the skinheads, the anti-Semitism, etcetera. But just like here, the good people don\u2122t make news, it\u2122 s the bad people that make the news, and I think in our society too, you hear about the killings of \u0152 you know, the teenagers that are shooting up our schools and all that, but you do n\u2122t read about the good kids or the kids that are scared. I met a little girl in Florida , she\u2122s 11 years old. There was a \u0152 well, talk Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 113about a \u0152 an incident in school and she was scared and she asked her mother, I don\u2122t want to go to school today because there\u2122s gonna be trouble. You know, there are \u0152 so what I\u2122m saying is there\u2122s good and bad everywhere . We don\u2122t \u0152 we don\u2122t hear about the good kids, we only hear about the bad kids. And I th ink you as a \u0152 as an educator, know that that is so. To condemn a whole generation or sector of the po pulation because of a few, is unfair. Any time you generalize, it\u2122s unfair, or even inaccurate. What\u2122s his name, Goldhagen? Every German is guilty? I haven\u2122t read his book. I read the synopsis in the \ufb01New York Times\ufb02 book review and all that. I don\u2122t want to read his book. He can come with statistics, but I don\u2122t think that every German down \u0152 deep down in his heart, felt anti-Semitic or was part \u0152 part-participated or wanted to participate. So he has a formula; that formula too, is not accurate. I think you ha ve to take people as individuals and that\u2122s what I try to do. They\u2122re good and they\u2122re not so good and they\u2122re outright bad. And n \u0152 that has been \u0152 I mean, I made my peace with Germany in 19 \u0152 in the 1950\u2122s, when I went back the first time on business with Hans Solomon (ph). We went back to Germany to try and do business in 1952. We went to the photo show in Cologne and we spent two weeks in Celle. Now he, being 15 years older than I, was there as an adult. He remem \u0152 knew a lot more people, and we looked up a lot of them and talked to them. Of course, in the 50\u2122s, nobody would know or ad mit that they knew anyt hing. But we talked to people who said yes, we knew that Bergen-Belsen, which was 15 miles away from Celle, that it was there, but we didn\u2122t know what was going on. We \u0152 the man who was \u0152 Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 114who supplied meat there, he went in there every couple of weeks, driving a truck in there, sure he saw. But he was told these are foreign Zwangsarbeiter , forced labor. But that they were systematically starved to death, or whatever, worked to death, he didn\u2122t know that. Nobody \u0152 nobody knew that other than the guards and the guards didn\u2122t tell, because it was self-incriminating. He supplied meats, he supplied food. Hey, we\u2122re taking food in there every week, you know. Whether \u0152 that this was only for the guards or whatever, nobody knew, right? So what I am \u0152 what I am saying is that we did talk about it. TherThere was a death march where people were marched from the railroad 15 miles to the camp. And yes, some of the people saw it a nd even taunted the prisoners and whatever, you know, on the death \u0152 that came out later. Yes, but those people aren\u2122t going to talk about it or advertise it or admit it, even. They are the ones that say, we don\u2122t want to talk about the past any more, we want to lo \u0152 but the young Germans, who now \u0152 I mean \u0152 I mean the new, young generatio n, whose grandparents were the perpetrators, participants or silent participants, they are now asking, why did you keep quiet? How could you kkeep quiet? They don\u2122t understand how th ey could have \u0152 how their parents and grandparents could have kept quiet. And it\u2122 s very hard in the 1990\u2122s, or 2000, to understand what the mentality was 50 years ago unless, you know the zeitgeist of the era, what the fears were, what the attitudes we re and why people kept quiet. Why people didn\u2122t speak out. They were scared. The man I told you about who lived below us, the people who helped us on Crystal Night, he was a high official at the court, the Supreme Interview with Kurt Roberg March 16, 2001 115Court. And he had the key for the ar \u0152 in \u0152 in the building, and up on \u0152 on the roof was a flag \u0152 you know, f \u0152 a \u0152 a flagstaff. And when the Nazis took over, they went up there to pull down the red, white and blue flag to hoist the Nazi flag. And who has the key? Rusterfeld(ph) has the key, get Rusterfeld(ph), and they said, we want the key. I don\u2122t have the key. Well, give us the key or we \u2122ll break down the door. So he rummaged and he found the key. And as they stormed up there and up there, he was heard to mumble under his breath, I hope they break their ne ck. Somebody heard it and he was indicted and \u0152 that he made this remark. He had enough friends in the court system that witnesses came up and said oh no, you heard it wrong. He said, I hope they don\u2122t break their neck, because it was so dangerous to climb up there. They gave him the benefit of the doubt and he was permitted to retire earl \u0152 take early retirement, okay? Now, there were people like that, okay? And he was watched from ther e on and he couldn\u2122t afford to make a wrong move, but he didn't permit his daughters to ever join the Nazi party, for the girl they have the Jungm\u00e4del or whatever, the Hitler youth. He could have redeemed himself to prove that he was not against them by saying I wa nt you to join, even if it\u2122s only pro forma. No, he stuck to his principles. Ther e were people like that. So who\u2122s to say who is good and who\u2122s bad?"

Why they did what th \u0152 why we did what we did, and you know, like some of them said, why do you stay so long? Why \u0152 you know, why didn't you leave earlier?
