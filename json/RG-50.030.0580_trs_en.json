On Piotrkowska 82, there was a \u0152 there was a family, their name was Krikos(ph), and she was a fashion designer, a known one, with in ternational ties, travels to [indecipherable] and so on. Her husband was taken away and killed in a prison. She remained alone and my father and I, my mother, were there helping her with anything we could. I was \u0152 I was maki ng sure that she has enough wood for the fireplace and things like that. Although it \u0152 it was just the beginning of the need of the wood. In the \u0152 in the ghetto, we met at the beginning and \u0152 and then all at once everything got to be a problem, distance was a problem, time, energy mostly was a problem, and so on. But she maintained \u0152 maintained contact with us, and aware to what\u2122s going on in our lives. She herself worked as one of the fashion designers or manager in a Beschen(ph) \u0152 Beschen(ph) Kleider factory, one of six Beschen(ph) and Kleider factories. Now, when \u0152 when I brought the bread to my mother and I gave it to her, a Jewish policeman grabbed me, took me into \u0152 into an entrance of RG-50.030*0580 31the house across Lagiewnicka and he beat me up. I was not supposed to be outside on the street. And now I think maybe he sa ved my life at that time, because if I would join them, I would be gone. But anyhow, it\u2122s \u0152 I was very humiliated. I think this what hurt the most. And in the middle of the night, I went to \u0152 to M-Mrs. Krikosava (ph) where she lived in Marysin . A-And I told her what happened, and can she either li \u0152 arrange for me to join my mother, or \u0152 or get my mother out of that transport. I didn\u2122t hear much \u0152 mu ch about that, but when my mother was taking away, this was \u0152 this was my \u0152 oh, I t \u0152 I didn\u2122t feel that \u0152 that I want to go on, especially. I wouldn\u2122t spend energy, I didn\u2122t have ener \u0152 I didn\u2122t go for my bread ration, which is once in 10 days or someth ing, which means death, dying, not \u0152 no \u0152 and di \u0152 she appeared. And she took me to he r office as a runner, in order to have a soup a day, and to survive \u0152 to survive on that soup or whatever til \u0152 til the \u0152 til the time comes for the regular allocation of food. And now \u0152 no w my story gets interesting, because as I was there, there was an inspection by the chief engi \u0152 by the chief of the Bescher(ph) and Kleider. To tell you also that when we came to the ghetto, there was somebody who was distri buting the apartments. The one who was the manager of our area was a name by the name of Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch (ph). Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch (ph) was now \u0152 was now in char ge of those factories, and \u0152 and Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch (ph) is the one who entered, and he stopped near me, and kind of, I thought accusingly, he is ask me how do I \u0152 what do I know you f- RG-50.030*0580 32from? And I say, from the cultural evenings, because he was attending. So he \u0152 he went ahead and I thought he is going to throw me out, he knows that this is fictitious, me being there, and eating the soup. But Krikosava (ph) followed, and together with other people, the manager, and she smiled to me, that me said nothing bad happened. And this continued for, I don\u2122 t know, two or three days. After \u0152 after which, the droshka(ph) firm with Rumkowski with the white horse, stopped in the front of the building, they calle d me out and they took me to Balucki Rynek. And Balucki Rynek was sitting Rumkowski, and on both side female secretaries and people, and so on, and \u0152 an d a \u0152 and they kind of \u0152 Rumkowski a-asked me a few words, and the other people, and I z \u0152 I saw Anodinka(ph), the head, and I am being taken to the house of Rumkowski , which was divided into four apartments. And in apartment number one, was the apartment for Dora Fuchs . That\u2122s the first time I learned about anybody like Dora Fuchs . Rumkowski, everybody sign \u0152 sings \u0152 Dora Fuchs was very often doing the things that they complained about, and that Rumkowski fought against, but this wasn\u2122t k nown publicly, this I learned later. And Bernard Fuchs, her brother, who died in Connecticut just a few years ago, his wife is still alive, Irena."

Where I went, what I went through had \u0152 had very little chance for RG-50.030*0580 50survival. I came together very romantically wi-with the boys and the girls, and \u0152 and we thought that we will live together, all of us, like a group of youngsters, but not men or women yet.

I think that I went through the initial selection because I couldn\u2122t believe I saw \u0152 we already knew, as we were undressing, they already told us. When we went one way, already people told us, you go to life. And \u0152 and I believer there were only maybe a hundred or 200 from the whole train, and the rest \u0152 the re st went right away to \u0152 the train which came a day before us, everybody went, the day after us, everybody else. Us, had a small \u0152 a small contingent of survivors. Bu t then there was the selection, and this time the selection was undressed.

When I came there, there was kind of a movement of resignation that he \u0152 he put me there to \u0152 lilike he kind of o-okay, put me to, and I RG-50.030*0580 51think was it, did my staring do it? My physic simply wasn\u2122t \u0152 I wasn\u2122t like a person for work yet, never \u0152 never did I see [indecipherable]. I will never know, nobody would never know, but I had other occasions that I remained alive because of something unexplainable, some \u0152 somebo dy did something, somebody had \u0152 had a moment of compassion, or \u0152 or \u0152 or \u0152 or whatever, again and again and again, because I came to Mauthausen later on.

But I must have mentioned that \u0152 the 30 th of May. That\u2122s what I was so \u0152 so the 30th of May must be my date, and \u0152 because in delirium wa \u0152 it came through.

At \u0152 Bolek (ph) Yakobovitch said, because the eggs were not delivered for \u0152 for breakfast, he says, you see? You can \u0152 you can live a day without eggs for breakfast, he says to Dora , or something like that. You see, you can eat \u0152 the chil \u0152 children were born and died in the ghetto RG-50.030*0580 58without ever seeing an egg, without knowi ng what it is, or what it tastes.

Dropped in and she had a sa ndwich and she started over with her s \u0152 she started to \u0152 to eat the sandwich and \u0152 and wrapped it up and put it back. She says, the doctors say \u0152 said the best \u0152 the best way \u0152 said, th-the \u0152 the best way to eat, is to stop eating while you are still hungry. This was in the ghetto where \u0152 which hunger was \u0152 was giving everybody an unen durable pain, just the \u0152 the feeling of hunger. The doctor told her that it\u2122s the healthiest to stop while she is still hungry, and exercise and a diet, or something like that. And I \u0152 I \u0152 I couldn\u2122t \u0152 I couldn\u2122t stop, my father just died of hunger. My mother was \u0152 must have been very afraid of being \u0152 being taken away, as a person who cannot work any more, or whatever. And then, okay, but then I \u0152 I prefer to be \u0152 to eat \u0152 which means, like I have my principles that I have to compromise with, but \u0152 an-and ne-nev ertheless, it was \u0152 it was good to \u0152 to eat that. At the same time when I went over to the other children, there was less food and less [indecipherable] but, at that time it wasn\u2122t a question of hunger or no hunger, and it didn\u2122t make a difference."

What happened that \u0152 that night, the blockalteste, the blockalteste, which means the leader of the block, at the entrance to the main block, th-there was a little \u0152 a little place which \u0152 which was the kitchen and also the blockalteste . In this RG-50.030*0580 69particular place it was not only the blockalteste, but also the lagerfuehrer \u0152 the lagerfuehrer, this means the main \u0152 the main blockalteste, whose name was Willie. Willie, nobody had anything against Willie. He \u0152 he was going to Familienlager very often. He was released early for \u0152 an-and sometimes people on a transport saw Willie, and \u0152 and it was like a friendly thing. He was a captain of a ship which sold the load because of some romantic entanglement, they said. And \u0152 and \u0152 and he was well known by \u0152 by the people. And the Familienlager who came from Theresienstadt, who were in the Potenkins (ph) village, feel it wasn\u2122t necessary any more to \u0152 to present that theater to the cro \u0152 Red Cross, Swedish Red Cross. And ththat Willie on one side. And now I \u0152 I was working in the kitchen, doing whatever they were telling me. It was getting late, but nobody told me what \u0152 what to do with myself. At one point, a \u0152 a German \u0152 th-there was an SS invited that \u0152 into to those festivities. Somebody there was a kapo who played on \u0152 on an accordion, or the \u0152 and that officer comes, an officer, it looke d to me like an important officer. But he came over to the kitchen, and he is drunk, and he is asking for water, and I gave him water, and I answer him in \u0152 in \u0152 in Ge rman. So he says, oh, I know German, how come that I know German? I must be a Mischling or something, and I said n-no, but at home, this means at home, this means Dora Fuchs and so on, we spoke only German. My first book, [indecipherable] in British Columbia, I \u0152 I read there, you know, the first German book. And \u0152 and I did the most stupid thing that anybody RG-50.030*0580 70can do in one\u2122s life, because I was embittered by \u0152 I saw the smoke coming out from \u0152 from the chimneys, and because he aske d me, do you also speak English? And I say, what for, so I burn better? A-And I showing this a \u0152 I thought, i-in a moment I will \u0152 my head will be under his boot, or he will shoot me, or he will [indecipherable] I \u0152 I [indecipherable] already on \u0152 already this second day, I have seen people killed all over the place. So he says \u0152 he kind of sobered up, and he says, oh no, not boys like you. We will \u0152 we will teach you a trade, and after the war you will be working for the Reich. And \u0152 and that\u2122s how it finished. The next \u0152 the next day, didn\u2122t finish \u0152 it didn\u2122t finish, I didn\u2122t tell to anyone that. And this is \u0152 then I don\u2122t know what to do. Willie, who \u0152 who occupied a c ubicle, says \u0152 says [indecipherable] there is a bed. A bed? People were lying on the floor all over. But I went bed, and he sidles up in the bed, an d I am petrified, completely. I don\u2122t move, I am frozen. He talks to me and so on, and \u0152 and I am \u0152 I am petrified. So he started to talk to his little dog, and he says that he is not a good burschak (ph), he is not this, and so on. He \u0152 he kind of turned around and I s \u0152 I \u0152 I left the bed, and I didn\u2122t have where to sleep. I didn\u2122t know if to go into the block if somebody will beat me up. So I remained in this section in the kitchen, a-and I slept there. In the morning I was woken by the din of givi ng \u0152 giving the \u0152 giving bread \u0152 bread and something [indecipherable] or whatever, to the passing people . So I helped. It was \u0152 this time it was some cheese, and the one from Pionki (ph), the \u0152 the butcher from Pionki (ph), RG-50.030*0580 71who was also the cook, was very nice to me and so on, so he also gave me some potato from the day before, which made a big difference. And later on, the boxes, the crates remained with \u0152 with the \u0152 for \u0152 with some cheese gl-glued to it. Can I take it and \u0152 and \u0152 to find my friends and give it to them? Well, my friends was \u0152 Walter I didn\u2122t know so \u0152 so well yet, but other, Benek(ph) and Chaim and \u0152 and so on. Benek(ph) in Maryland , here, nearby, he lives nearby. It started to \u0152 I went out with the box, and people absolutely a ttacked me, to \u0152 broke the box into little pieces. I never found him, and there was like between the blocks, you \u0152 you had like a promenade. There was a time that you were in between things, and you could walk back and forth. And I don\u2122t know if it wa s the same day, or the second day or the third day or the fourth day. After a very short time, all at once, everybody on one section of the \u0152 of the \u0152 of the promenade is being like taken \u0152 taking in a gauntlet, and put into a block, and some \u0152 some people, like stronger pe ople would be put aside, but small people, and old people, who \u0152 who somehow \u0152 some of them were [indecipherable] for some time \u0152 I was new \u0152 were pushed into \u0152 in to that block, op-opposite the 14 block. Now, thi-this \u0152 this was \u0152 it \u0152 it was so tight that it was like \u0152 it was difficult to breathe, because everything was squeezed. No sitting, no this, you know, just trying to sit in each other\u2122s lap, fighting for breath. I remember my chest hurting the way it hurt now, with a \u0152 with heart disease, like empty, empty hurting. And \u0152 and it was in the middle of the night, middle of the night or whatever, RG-50.030*0580 72there are cries, the lights go on, flashlights coming to \u0152 to my row, showing no this, this, people started to try and make space. I was taken out from th at bunch of people, brought to the door. At the door was the German officer, Willie, the guy who wanted me to \u0152 to \u0152 to do sexual things to him, and Karl , which was the \u0152 the main kapo , or \u0152 aft-after Willie, a man \u0152 a man \u0152 a lame \u0152 a lame person with a stick. And they pulled me out and they put me into block number two. In block number two there was a bunk to sleep, and \u0152 and this was the first block near the SS stuba entrance. And the Canada commando were there. Canada commando were actually the people who were \u0152 not where they do the \u0152 I \u0152 I read something, clothing and so on. Some of the things with the Canada commando, yes, those were clothing, things to sort out. But the people who were working at the receival \u0152 at th-the \u0152 re-receiving the people on the train and emptying this and so on, this was the \u0152 the real Canada commando. Most of them at that time were from Holland, where \u0152 where I was. They had food and all kind of th ings. I was brought there, and they pass without any resolution where I belong and what\u2122s my name, or whatever. And \u0152 and then I am told that I will be \u0152 I will be the runner for the SS stuba, which was the next, and the SS stuba, th \u0152 it means, like if there was a raport(ph), an appell , and everyone had to be in front of the block, and later they would make a tally of \u0152 of the people, and \u0152 and I would \u0152 I would have to run along it, and bring the pieces of paper. The raport(ph) pier(ph) is standing in the middle, would correlate if th \u0152 all RG-50.030*0580 73the people are there. If not, the thing has repeated itself. Sometimes it repeated just in order to show people, you know, to be punitive, or \u0152 or whatever. And that what I was doing, and jobs were bei ng piled up on me. One of the SS men had the rabbits, and he wanted me to bring greens. The greens were \u0152 were growing near the electric wire, where nobody would go. But I got a nu mber, for the first time, I got a number, which yesterday here I was in the file with my number, which is already not visible, almost not visible. It \u0152 it was a small \u0152 a small portion of that. You \u0152 you probably haven\u2122t seen a number that \u0152 and \u0152 I\u2122m sorry, yo-you said something?"

Once somebody came to me, that\u2122s means \u0152 those people were in \u0152 in Theresienstadt. Somebody came to me and says, I heard that you were in Birkenau at that \u0152 that time, and she said that they saw my brother, from \u0152 from Theresienstadt, from Familienlager, there. Is it possible that \u0152 that he \u0152 that he was there? And \u0152 an d I told her, yes, it\u2122s possible. Somebody passed on the same circumstances saying y ou shouldn\u2122t give people false hope. I \u0152 I felt insulted. I didn\u2122t, but it was possible, why was it possible? On the last night, when \u0152 when they were ta king out all the people from Theresienstadt, it was Willie, and his friend Karl, and probably contacts that he had, which allowed him to bring approximately a hundred \u0152 hundre d people \u0152 hundred young men from \u0152 from the Theresienstadt out into our end. And so they avoided being th-th-they \u0152 th-they remained alive. So yeah, her brother could have been \u0152 her brother survived this particular person. But so \u0152 an-and then th ere was a dispute with those people. What hundred people, what are you sa \u0152 talkin g about? Only 22, we were the only ones who remained, 22. My friend, he\u2122s a psychiatrist, and he was in this. And I said, no, there were a hundred, I was there. Gilbert wer \u0152 wote \u0152 wrote a book, the \u0152 the boys of Birkenau, or something like that. A-And he writes about those \u0152 those children, and \u0152 and he \u0152 and he writes about those hundred and \u0152 there is a page for \u0152 for every one of those hundred, and they are still in England, the ones who are alive, RG-50.030*0580 76most of them are alive, and they are still in England. So this was \u0152 this was what I knew, that little, in the \u0152 in the camp, and \u0152 and the later, because I just met people from there and we were comparing notes on some occasion. Just how I learned, I thought that Dina Gottliebova is a \u0152 a \u0152 a \u0152 I said that the-there was a \u0152 once, I said [indecipherable] I said \u0152 somebody sa \u0152 oh, I see you have a number from Birkenau. I said yes. So I say, I see you have a number, too. So, yes, yes, I was there, in the Familienlager. And I said, there is someone on my mind that said, I will probably never find out what happened to her. She was sent, so I thought she is going with \u0152 she is going with Mengele , she probably knows much more than the rest of us do. And probably \u0152 and \u0152 and sh e was sad. This also \u0152 this also doesn\u2122t allow me much hope. She \u0152 she [indecipherable] to \u0152 had a husband, Rudy, and \u0152 and she says he is talking about Dina Gottliebova. Bobbit. I was in contact with her later on, and Bobbit \u0152 Bobbit is a \u0152 is \u0152 is her husband\u2122s \u0152 her husband\u2122s name. And she was fighting to get the \u0152 to get so me \u0152 she was also somebody who not \u0152 admired her boss. And this is \u0152 she admired things about Mengele. Things were coming all the time. When she talked abou \u0152 about Mengele, some kind of pride came into her voice, you know? Like she would make an example. She says, I made his portrait, she says. She was doing many portraits for his friends as gifts. And \u0152 and then six or seven of th ose Gypsy paintings, and the wall, which is probably in Israel, in Yad Vashem , the \u0152 the wall \u0152 the wall the seven dwarfs, that\u2122s what the RG-50.030*0580 77children wanted \u0152 wanted once they were there, in the Familienlager. They were in a room, and she painted it. And \u0152 and, so the seven dwarfs. And actually, she married the man who was the author of one of the seven dwarfs, which is Bobbitt. So, we are now with the \u0152 so I thought that there is no survival. There is absolutely, there is absolutely no survival. And \u0152"

But my friends were there, and as a matter of fact, they are in Montreal and now he re-retired as a \u0152 an \u0152 and he is writing his third book in Czech, about those times, about a re \u0152 reminiscences. He is \u0152 their children are \u0152 were from childhood, with what happened, involved writing poetry on those sa \u0152 things. My children, I protected them as mu ch as I could, especially since I lost her \u0152 their mother at the age of nine and 12. This is my daughter, she was nine when my \u0152 when my wife has died. So, the number \u0152 I said this is a telephone number, and so on. Til today they don\u2122t know. Part of the fact that the family is meeting together here and I am giving the testimony and w ill try also to leave the testimony for my family out there. This is the same, this \u0152 thi-this is part why we are here. But just an aside, that it\u2122s good for the children to know rather to not know, because they \u0152 they know anyhow, but in some dark and un touchable way. What \u0152 what happened \u0152 RG-50.030*0580 78what happened later on, I was lucky again. There was a \u0152 they were supposed to \u0152 to e-empty the Zigeunerlager , and I don\u2122t know \u0152 I don\u2122t know the \u0152 how \u0152 how those minds worked, but Willie was interested in my survival. Karl was nice to me. I-It\u2122s \u0152 n-nobody bother me. I \u0152 I could help othe rs. I knew two boys, and their father was put in \u0152 into a \u0152 into that \u0152 the same bloc k where I was, and they wanted to get the father out, and they gave me a \u0152 a diamon d, I didn\u2122t want the diamond. And I went to \u0152 to one of the Dutch people that I kne w, and I ask him for a couple of sardine boxes, so they can bribe the \u0152 the blockalteste. They went, they bribed, they got the father out. Later they were \u0152 they were all going from some \u0152 on some assignment to work, hopefully. I gave him back the diamond and he accepted it. And \u0152 so the idea is, if I could, somebody was in the krankenbau, in the hospital, I will bring in a metal container, food. But at one time th e guard shot down the line. I \u0152 I was startled, and I got electrified, and \u0152 and fell out while \u0152 while this happened. I also was [indecipherable] flowing back, and disconnected, but it \u0152 it was a fe \u0152 quite a feeling to \u0152 to be the \u0152 I was going to \u0152 to look for Mrs. Feldman , who was the head of the orphanage before, that \u0152 the same orphanage. And she was not \u0152 she is an artist, a known person in my life, felt fine. Mrs. Feldstein. And I \u0152 I found other people. They asked me for warm underwear, and \u0152 and I would be bringing to the people warm underwear. One of them had the relative in Montreal, who said that her underwear that I brought saved her life. Whatever. It \u0152 it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s probably RG-50.030*0580 79misconception with some people that it wa s dog eat dog and only dog eat dog. It wasn\u2122t. People were doing things when they could. I did too. It was almost something pushing me do something good, si nce, you know, like \u0152 so \u0152 so this was the time, and \u0152 but I don\u2122t understand why Willie was so nice to me, after \u0152 after trying to \u0152 to \u0152 to get me to be his playth ing or whatever. He \u0152 he wasn\u2122t rough, or he wasn\u2122t this. Talked to his dog that I am not a good bo y. And \u0152 and later he is \u0152 and I am \u0152 as the camp was going to be emptied, I am getting a letter from an SS, probably the same officer, who I never, ever saw again. And that letter \u0152 with that letter, I was sent to Sosnowice. And in Sosnowice \u0152 in Sosnowice, I arrived and I gave the letter to the commandant of the cam p. And he says, if you were look \u0152 you were good enough to be a runner in \u0152 in Birkenau, you are good enough to be a runner for me. One of the strangest things happened; if somebody would make a film, I would be the first one to say this is impossible: I was \u0152 I was running, stoking the fires in all the SS have their barracks, I was stoking the \u0152 stoking the fire and \u0152 and all that; ea-eating sometimes from the \u0152 from the SS kitchen. Everybody knew me, it was a small camp. I said that I was interested to see the machinery, always interested me, machinery [indecipherable]. So I went for one shift, commandant praising me that I am interested. So I \u0152 I went to \u0152 to the factory. I liked what I saw. Poles were working together with the Jews from the camp, the relations were this. I didn\u2122t see a Pole for years, five years, well, at that time. And it was very nice, I ti \u0152 I RG-50.030*0580 80fell a little bit in love with one Polish woman who was in the center of the factory, writing things down, reading poetry, so we have something \u0152 something in common. She was talking something, so the youngsters that I said are running away they say, to \u0152 to the [indecipherable] to Warsaw , actually go into the forest, talking that maybe I can go into the forest, but I will have to avoid the \u0152 the Polish partisans and go 30 kilometers. It\u2122s \u0152 I made a little reading lamp in the workshop of the camp, for the commandant, an SS man, a young SS man sees me and he says, oh, did you do it? And I said yes. So \u0152 so I say, take it. So he says, no, I will \u0152 di \u0152 you made it for the \u0152 for the commandant, no I will not take it. So I say okay, so I will make you another one. I \u0152 I make him \u0152 I made him another one later on. This is the young one, who was later killing people on that \u0152 on that road and sharing the bread with me, and other things, which \u0152 which help me to survive. There was another SS man there from Austria, who was crying his head off be cause he didn\u2122t hear from his wife, and he thought maybe they were bom bed, a-and \u0152 and I \u0152 I put my arm on him, saying that the \u0152 maybe the post does n\u2122t work or things. He shared with me some sugar cubes, also on the trip, on that long trip where so many people were \u0152 were \u0152 were killed, per we \u0152"

Okay, he got to be a commandant in Dachau , so he is not a gent-gentle \u0152 as a matter of fact, so gentle, his family, like, they adopted me. I was running around the camp, I had the movement. The telephone was ringing in the \u0152 in the office, I would pick it up and say, this is Camp Sosnowice, so and so, and take a message. And \u0152 and now it looked to me \u0152 show it to me in a film and I don\u2122t believe it, you know? That \u0152 so this was the true. But \u0152 but that\u2122s how it was, that was the thing. I \u0152 I was a \u0152 a \u0152 decorating the \u0152 the Christmas tree. I took every candy out, as a joke, and \u0152 and have only empty candies there, I didn\u2122t need the candies.

The \u0152 the gift that I brought to the commandant that I made, wa s packed as a gift from \u0152 from me. The family had gifts \u0152 gifts for me for Passover. It\u2122s a \u0152 it was a crazy time out, a-at crazy times, crazy places. Sosnowice was different, separate from \u0152 from anything else you \u0152 you \u0152 you can say. Nobody was \u0152"

            "answer": "They were \u0152 they were in \u0152 in Sosnowice, they had to march a certain disdistance, and oh \u0152 oh \u0152 oh yes, I \u0152 when they started to tear with running away to \u0152 to the partisans, I \u0152 I asked the \u0152 the commandant to be \u0152 to \u0152 to \u0152 to free me from my duties, because I want to learn a trade, to be useful. And he stopped the whole column and praised me, because \u0152 and I actually wanted to see \u0152 to give a chance to run away, and \u0152 and to see he r more often. She was much older, with knowing eyes, she knew exactly what it\u2122s doing to me. I was the hungry. I was rested. It\u2122s \u0152 so, that was \u0152 that was \u0152 so one morning \u0152 one morn ing, everything is packed. I didn\u2122t have to worry any more what choice I am making, it was a difficult choice to be courageous, to run away. I didn\u2122t know if I had the courage. And we started to \u0152 to [indecipherable] at Gliwice, the commandant unloaded his stuff, his furniture, and \u0152 and it occurred to me that I will ask him that \u0152 maybe to hide in the furniture and I will help the family later on. But I chickened out on that as well. After \u0152 after that, that young SS man was crazy, the \u0152 going around and shooting people; he had so much energy. He brought me \u0152 at the end of the day he brought me his coat, spattered with blood, to wash out the blood. And I was washing out the blood, and felt sick over it, brought it to a place where \u0152 where they \u0152 where the SS were sleeping on the floor with \u0152 with \u0152 and there was a panzerfaust or something, you know, a grenade, and I thought \u0152 I thought if I will grab the grenade and throw it, maybe we\u2122ll change our \u0152 b ecause we could hear the Russians in the back. And \u0152 RG-50.030*0580 83anyhow, I didn't know how to actuate it. It\u2122s \u0152 I s \u0152 I saw a movie only recently where \u0152 about a school for SS, and said that you unscrew the bottom. So for half a century I didn\u2122t know how I could have done it, but I saw the movie, right, yeah, now, now. So, and \u0152 and that way we came to Mauthausen . Mauthausen was \u0152 was \u0152 I had, from sleeping on the ground, I had four large furuncles. I couldn\u2122t bring it down. I went through the selection, beca use it was in \u0152 in two days it swelled up more and more. We had the \u0152 the \u0152 that thing written, that\u2122s me \u0152 somebody was going around writing down the names of the ones who have to go to the hospital. The hospital actually was the Russian lager, and actually it was a place where they kill people. Put people in, and bottles of chlorinated water, phenol injections, al-all kind of things. So, on the way \u0152 and this mi ght be of interest, on \u0152 on the way there, there is the lageralteste from \u0152 from Sosnowice, and the lageralteste was \u0152 was a \u0152 a delegate to the \u0152 to the Reichsdeutsche\u2122s Reichstag, wha-whatever the na \u0152 the name was. And \u0152 and he was held in very high esteem by the raportfuehrer. I heard what\u2122s going on, the bombing, because the tw o of them talked, and \u0152 and later I saw this lageralteste, but he was hiding his \u0152 his red \u0152 red triangle, because the \u0152 the kapos in Mauthausen were criminals, and not political. And \u0152 and this kapo criminal was actually in charge of the Jehov ah Witnesses. They have some tailoring blocks, or whatever. So he talk ed \u0152 he talked to \u0152 to that kapo as we pass. My group was halted, and \u0152 and they\u2122d say talk to th e Yugoslav, and I was brought to that \u0152 to RG-50.030*0580 84that hospital, which I didn\u2122t know, only that it\u2122s not a good place. I didn\u2122t know that I will go to death. And some SS put me on a table from \u0152 from stone, and he started to cut and I started to faint. He sprayed something and I fainted again. And I was brought to the block. I was brought to \u0152 I don\u2122t know when and how I was brought to the block."

What he didn\u2122t know, he couldn\u2122t have known, that near the barracks now are those tents, and the bombs fell into the tents. So, there was that all over, and pieces of flesh. There was no place for everybody in the tent. Flesh on the wires around that. The next day there was \u0152 there were cooking fires, that the people still had utensils from their trip. Kaduk(ph), a raportfuehrer from Auschwitz was going around. Wherever he saw something in a pot which was suspicious, he would kick it over and shoot a few people.

Later on, there was no \u0152 there were no bombs, and you could see missing buttocks on people still alive, still RG-50.030*0580 87the \u0152 the mouth is still moving.

Came to Gunskirchen, Gunskirchen was \u0152 was the place to die. I was dying. There was no place to lie down inside, outside it was rain. So people went on and use \u0152 use the belt to remain on the rafters. I did, too, but you couldn\u2122t go out, if you go out, they would not allow you to come back. Some people didn\u2122t care. I crawled down, I couldn\u2122t come back. Remained there near the \u0152 near the dig-out, which was from before, with feces and so on, and \u0152 and in the rain. And \u0152 and the Americans came.

So, I-I \u0152 I-I was \u0152 I was going around with that paper, and then I see a group of people [indecipherable] you have to sleep over, eat something.

As \u0152 so I ha d to sleep over, and so on. They were encourage \u0152 they didn\u2122t have enough \u0152 enough youngsters.

My wife was from Canada, we \u0152 we were not sure where we will be, but decided to give one year to Canada, which with the birth of my son and so on, turned into a permanent thing.
