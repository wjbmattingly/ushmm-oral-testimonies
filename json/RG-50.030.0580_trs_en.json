On Piotrkowska 82, there was a \u2014 there was a family, their name was Krikos(ph), and she was a fashion designer, a known one, with international ties, travels to [indecipherable] and so on. Her husband was taken away and killed in a prison. She remained alone and my father and I, my mother, were there helping her with anything we could. I was \u2014 I was making sure that she has enough wood for the fireplace and things like that. Although it \u2014 it was just the beginning of the need of the wood. In the \u2014 in the ghetto, we met at the beginning and \u2014 and then all at once everything got to be a problem, distance was a problem, time, energy mostly was a problem, and so on. But she maintained \u2014 maintained contact with us, and aware to what\u2019s going on in our lives. She herself worked as one of the fashion designers or manager in a Beschen(ph) \u2014 Beschen(ph) Kleider factory, one of six Beschen(ph) and Kleider factories. Now, when \u2014 when I brought the bread to my mother and I gave it to her, a Jewish policeman grabbed me, took me into \u2014 into an entrance of Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection RG-50.030*0580 31 the house across Lagiewnicka and he beat me up. I was not supposed to be outside on the street. And now I think maybe he saved my life at that time, because if I would join them, I would be gone. But anyhow, it\u2019s \u2014 I was very humiliated. I think this what hurt the most. And in the middle of the night, I went to \u2014 to M-Mrs. Krikosava(ph) where she lived in Marysin. A-And I told her what happened, and can she either li \u2014 arrange for me to join my mother, or \u2014 or get my mother out of that transport. I didn\u2019t hear much \u2014 much about that, but when my mother was taking away, this was \u2014 this was my \u2014 oh, I t\u2014 I didn\u2019t feel that \u2014 that I want to go on, especially. I wouldn\u2019t spend energy, I didn\u2019t have ener \u2014 I didn\u2019t go for my bread ration, which is once in 10 days or something, which means death, dying, not \u2014 no \u2014 and di\u2014 she appeared. And she took me to her office as a runner, in order to have a soup a day, and to survive \u2014 to survive on that soup or whatever til \u2014 til the \u2014 til the time comes for the regular allocation of food. And now \u2014 now my story gets interesting, because as I was there, there was an inspection by the chief engi \u2014 by the chief of the Bescher(ph) and Kleider. To tell you also that when we came to the ghetto, there was somebody who was distributing the apartments. The one who was the manager of our area was a name by the name of Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch(ph). Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch(ph) was now \u2014 was now in charge of those factories, and \u2014 and Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch(ph) is the one who entered, and he stopped near me, and kind of, I thought accusingly, he is ask me how do I \u2014 what do I know you f- Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection RG-50.030*0580 32 from? And I say, from the cultural evenings, because he was attending. So he \u2014 he went ahead and I thought he 1s going to throw me out, he knows that this 1s fictitious, me being there, and eating the soup. But Krikosava(ph) followed, and together with other people, the manager, and she smiled to me, that me said nothing bad happened. And this continued for, I don\u2019t know, two or three days. After \u2014 after which, the droshka(ph) firm with Rumkowski with the white horse, stopped in the front of the building, they called me out and they took me to Balucki Rynek. And Balucki Rynek was sitting Rumkowski, and on both side female secretaries and people, and so on, and \u2014 and a \u2014 and they kind of \u2014- Rumkowski a-asked me a few words, and the other people, and I z\u2014 I saw Anodinka(ph), the head, and I am being taken to the house of Rumkowski, which was divided into four apartments. And in apartment number one, was the apartment for Dora Fuchs. That\u2019s the first time I learned about anybody like Dora Fuchs. Rumkowski, everybody sign \u2014 sings \u2014 Dora Fuchs was very often doing the things that they complained about, and that Rumkowski fought against, but this wasn\u2019t known publicly, this I learned later. And Bernard Fuchs, her brother, who died in Connecticut just a few years ago, his wife is still alive, Irena."

The \u2014 the people who died, almost at his hands, which may count to hundreds and thousands, they cannot write letters that he saved them \u2014 their life.

Where I went, what I went through had \u2014 had very little chance for RG-50.030*0580 50 survival. I came together very romantically wi-with the boys and the girls, and \u2014 and we thought that we will live together, all of us, like a group of youngsters, but not men or women yet. That we will share everything, that once we come to the labor thing and so on, we will support each other, and we will be strong and \u2014 and so on, SO \u2014 w-we came to be [indecipherable]. So, you know, in Birkenau right away, right away part of us didn\u2019t make it. I ma \u2014 I made it, I was small \u2014 I am small. And I don\u2019t know how I went through \u2014 through the initial selection. I think that I went through the initial selection because I couldn\u2019t believe I saw \u2014 we already knew, as we were undressing, they already told us. When we went one way, already people told us, you go to life. And \u2014 and I believer there were only maybe a hundred or 200 from the whole train, and the rest \u2014 the rest went right away to \u2014 the train which came a day before us, everybody went, the day after us, everybody else. Us, had a small \u2014 a small contingent of survivors. But then there was the selection, and this time the selection was undressed. So, I have a white jacket, because see, it was custom made still. I had from that time, so maybe I looked a little bit stronger. But then we were \u2014 we were undress, and there was that figure in black going back and forth, and it really fascinated me, like that \u2014 that \u2014 that situation of a man deciding that or \u2014 or \u2014 and I was \u2014 and I was looking at \u2014 at that \u2014 at that assessment, a-and I was \u2014 I was staring. When I came there, there was kind of a movement of resignation that he \u2014 he put me there to \u2014 li-like he kind of o-okay, put me to, and I RG-50.030*0580 31 think was it, did my staring do 1t? My physic simply wasn\u2019t \u2014 I wasn\u2019t like a person for work yet, never \u2014 never did I see [indecipherable]. I will never know, nobody would never know, but I had other occasions that I remained alive because of something unexplainable, some \u2014 somebody did something, somebody had \u2014 had a moment of compassion, or \u2014 or \u2014 or \u2014 or whatever, again and again and again, because I came to Mauthausen later on.

On \u2014 I \u2014 I must have, in my delirium, I must have in the hospital in \u2014 in Austria, in the basement of the hospital, I must have, being delirious, and I remember talking del \u2014 del \u2014 delirious. As a matter of fact, I remember that I was doing some \u2014 that I was e-engage and ar-articulate whatever speeches. That\u2019s what I remember from my \u2014 from my be-being in a high delirium. But I must have mentioned that \u2014 the 30\" of May. That\u2019s what I was so \u2014 so the 30\" of May must be my date, and \u2014 because in delirium wa \u2014 it came through.

But it was every morning, almost every morning, the chief of police, Rozenblat or something, would bring eggs. At one time he forgot to bring eggs, and Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch was sleeping over, he was sleeping over, af-after all, she \u2014 she was his fianc\u00e9, Bolek(ph) \u2014 Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch was eating breakfast, my father died of hunger, this was early in the game. And I was eating breakfast, I \u2014 I finished my breakfast, Dora\u2019s father, Papa was invited for breakfast. So he was eating breakfast and \u2014 and he was \u2014 he packed lunch, a beautiful sandwich or something with an egg and sp \u2014 it was with, not egg, sprouts and things like that. And he unpacked it after I finished breakfast and says, would you like to eat my lunch? I didn\u2019t give it a second thought, I ate his lunch. But he was sending me \u2014 I also got the message, you know? We \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 we measure \u2014 we \u2014 we measure, somehow, you know, what we \u2014 or whatever. At \u2014 Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch said, because the eggs were not delivered for \u2014 for breakfast, he says, you see? You can \u2014 you can live a day without eggs for breakfast, he says to Dora, or something like that. You see, you can eat \u2014 the chil \u2014 children were born and died in the ghetto RG-50.030*0580 58 without ever seeing an egg, without knowing what it is, or what it tastes. And he says that it\u2019s possible to survive. Yakobovitch wife, Regina, dropped in just to have a talk with me. Dropped in and she had a sandwich and she started over with her s \u2014 she started to \u2014 to eat the sandwich and \u2014 and wrapped it up and put it back. She says, the doctors say \u2014 said the best \u2014 the best way \u2014 said, th-the \u2014 the best way to eat, is to stop eating while you are still hungry. This was in the ghetto where \u2014 which hunger was \u2014 was giving everybody an unendurable pain, just the \u2014 the feeling of hunger. The doctor told her that it\u2019s the healthiest to stop while she is still hungry, and exercise and a diet, or something like that. And I \u2014 I\u2014 I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t stop, my father just died of hunger. My mother was \u2014 must have been very afraid of being \u2014 being taken away, as a person who cannot work any more, or whatever. And then, okay, but then I \u2014 I prefer to be \u2014 to eat \u2014 which means, like I have my principles that I have to compromise with, but \u2014 an-and ne-nevertheless, it was \u2014 it was good to \u2014 to eat that. At the same time when I went over to the other children, there was less food and less [indecipherable] but, at that time it wasn\u2019t a question of hunger or no hunger, and it didn\u2019t make a difference."

And everyone started to peel potatoes. I knew I have no chance, I \u2014 I was squashed by the people. I remained where I was, near the wall, and he pointed at me. And \u2014 and people started to pass me o-overhead to \u2014 to him, like \u2014 and \u2014 and they say, oh you will survive, you will survive, like this would be, you know, like peeling potatoes would mean survival. And I peeled potatoes, they cooked. What happened that \u2014 that night, the blockalteste, the blockalteste, which means the leader of the block, at the entrance to the main block, th-there was a little \u2014a little place which \u2014 which was the kitchen and also the blockalteste. In this RG-50.030*0580 69 particular place it was not only the blockalteste, but also the lagerfuehrer \u2014 the lagerfuehrer, this means the main \u2014 the main blockalteste, whose name was Willie. Willie, nobody had anything against Willie. He \u2014 he was going to Familienlager very often. He was released early for \u2014 an-and sometimes people on a transport saw Willie, and \u2014 and it was like a friendly thing. He was a captain of a ship which sold the load because of some romantic entanglement, they said. And \u2014 and \u2014 and he was well known by \u2014 by the people. And the Familienlager who came from Theresienstadt, who were in the Potenkins(ph) village, feel it wasn\u2019t necessary any more to \u2014 to present that theater to the cro \u2014 Red Cross, Swedish Red Cross. And th- that Willie on one side. And now I \u2014I was working in the kitchen, doing whatever they were telling me. It was getting late, but nobody told me what \u2014 what to do with myself. At one point, a\u2014 a German \u2014 th-there was an SS invited that \u2014 into to those festivities. Somebody there was a kapo who played on \u2014 on an accordion, or the \u2014 and that officer comes, an officer, it looked to me like an important officer. But he came over to the kitchen, and he is drunk, and he is asking for water, and I gave him water, and I answer him in \u2014 in \u2014 in German. So he says, oh, I know German, how come that I know German? I must be a Mischling or something, and I said n-no, but at home, this means at home, this means Dora Fuchs and so on, we spoke only German. My first book, [indecipherable] in British Columbia, I \u2014 I read there, you know, the first German book. And \u2014 and I did the most stupid thing that anybody Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection RG-50.030*0580 70 can do in one\u2019s life, because I was embittered by \u2014 I saw the smoke coming out from \u2014 from the chimneys, and because he asked me, do you also speak English? And I say, what for, so I burn better? A-And I showing this a \u2014 I thought, 1-in a moment I will \u2014 my head will be under his boot, or he will shoot me, or he will [indecipherable] I \u2014 I [indecipherable] already on \u2014 already this second day, I have seen people killed all over the place. So he says \u2014 he kind of sobered up, and he says, oh no, not boys like you. We will \u2014 we will teach you a trade, and after the war you will be working for the Reich. And \u2014 and that\u2019s how it finished. The next \u2014 the next day, didn\u2019t finish \u2014 it didn\u2019t finish, I didn\u2019t tell to anyone that. And this is \u2014 then I don\u2019t know what to do. Willie, who \u2014 who occupied a cubicle, says \u2014 says [indecipherable] there is a bed. A bed? People were lying on the floor all over. But I went bed, and he sidles up in the bed, and I am petrified, completely. I don\u2019t move, I am frozen. He talks to me and so on, and \u2014 and I am \u2014 I am petrified. So he started to talk to his little dog, and he says that he is not a good burschak(ph), he is not this, and so on. He \u2014 he kind of turned around and I s \u2014 I \u2014I left the bed, and I didn\u2019t have where to sleep. I didn\u2019t know if to go into the block if somebody will beat me up. So I remained in this section in the kitchen, a-and I slept there. In the morning I was woken by the din of giving \u2014 giving the \u2014 giving bread \u2014 bread and something [indecipherable] or whatever, to the passing people. So I helped. It was \u2014 this time it was some cheese, and the one from Pionki(ph), the \u2014 the butcher from Pionki(ph), RG-50.030*0580 71 who was also the cook, was very nice to me and so on, so he also gave me some potato from the day before, which made a big difference. And later on, the boxes, the crates remained with \u2014 with the \u2014 for \u2014 with some cheese gl-glued to it. Can I take it and \u2014 and \u2014 to find my friends and give it to them? Well, my friends was \u2014 Walter I didn\u2019t know so \u2014 so well yet, but other, Benek(ph) and Chaim and \u2014 and so on. Benek(ph) in Maryland, here, nearby, he lives nearby. It started to \u2014 I went out with the box, and people absolutely attacked me, to \u2014 broke the box into little pieces. I never found him, and there was like between the blocks, you \u2014 you had like a promenade. There was a time that you were in between things, and you could walk back and forth. And I don\u2019t know if it was the same day, or the second day or the third day or the fourth day. After a very short time, all at once, everybody on one section of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the promenade is being like taken \u2014 taking 1n a gauntlet, and put into a block, and some \u2014 some people, like stronger people would be put aside, but small people, and old people, who \u2014 who somehow \u2014 some of them were [indecipherable] for some time \u2014 I was new \u2014 were pushed into \u2014 into that block, op-opposite the 14 block. Now, thi-this \u2014 this was \u2014 it \u2014 it was so tight that 1t was like \u2014 it was difficult to breathe, because everything was squeezed. No sitting, no this, you know, just trying to sit in each other\u2019s lap, fighting for breath. I remember my chest hurting the way it hurt now, with a \u2014 with heart disease, like empty, empty hurting. And \u2014 and it was in the middle of the night, middle of the night or whatever, RG-50.030*0580 72 there are cries, the lights go on, flashlights coming to \u2014 to my row, showing no this, this, people started to try and make space. I was taken out from that bunch of people, brought to the door. At the door was the German officer, Willie, the guy who wanted me to \u2014 to \u2014 to do sexual things to him, and Karl, which was the \u2014 the main kapo, or \u2014 aft-after Willie, a man \u2014 a man \u2014 a lame \u2014 a lame person with a stick. And they pulled me out and they put me into block number two. In block number two there was a bunk to sleep, and \u2014 and this was the first block near the SS stuba entrance. And the Canada commando were there. Canada commando were actually the people who were \u2014 not where they do the \u2014 I \u2014 I read something, clothing and so on. Some of the things with the Canada commando, yes, those were clothing, things to sort out. But the people who were working at the receival \u2014 at th-the \u2014 re- receiving the people on the train and emptying this and so on, this was the \u2014 the real Canada commando. Most of them at that time were from Holland, where \u2014 where I was. They had food and all kind of things. I was brought there, and they pass without any resolution where I belong and what\u2019s my name, or whatever. And \u2014 and then I am told that I will be \u2014 I will be the runner for the SS stuba, which was the next, and the SS stuba, th \u2014 it means, like if there was a raport(ph), an appell, and everyone had to be in front of the block, and later they would make a tally of \u2014 of the people, and \u2014 and I would \u2014 I would have to run along it, and bring the pieces of paper. The raport(ph) pier(ph) is standing in the middle, would correlate if th \u2014 all RG-50.030*0580 73 the people are there. If not, the thing has repeated itself. Sometimes it repeated just in order to show people, you know, to be punitive, or \u2014 or whatever. And that what I was doing, and jobs were being piled up on me. One of the SS men had the rabbits, and he wanted me to bring greens. The greens were \u2014 were growing near the electric wire, where nobody would go. But I got a number, for the first time, I got a number, which yesterday here I was in the file with my number, which is already not visible, almost not visible. It \u2014 1t was a small \u2014 a small portion of that. You \u2014 you probably haven\u2019t seen a number that \u2014 and \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, yo-you said something?"

Once somebody came to me, that\u2019s means \u2014 those people were in \u2014 in Theresienstadt. Somebody came to me and says, I heard that you were in Birkenau at that \u2014 that time, and she said that they saw my brother, from \u2014 from Theresienstadt, from Familienlager, there. Is it possible that \u2014 that he \u2014 that he was there? And \u2014 and I told her, yes, it\u2019s possible. Somebody passed on the same circumstances saying you shouldn\u2019t give people false hope. I \u2014 I felt insulted. I didn\u2019t, but it was possible, why was it possible? On the last night, when \u2014 when they were taking out all the people from Theresienstadt, it was Willie, and his friend Karl, and probably contacts that he had, which allowed him to bring approximately a hundred \u2014 hundred people \u2014 hundred young men from \u2014 from the Theresienstadt out into our end. And so they avoided being th-th-they \u2014 th-they remained alive. So yeah, her brother could have been \u2014 her brother survived this particular person. But so \u2014 an-and then there was a dispute with those people. What hundred people, what are you sa \u2014 talking about? Only 22, we were the only ones who remained, 22. My friend, he\u2019s a psychiatrist, and he was in this. And I said, no, there were a hundred, I was there. Gilbert wer \u2014 wote \u2014 wrote a book, the \u2014 the boys of Birkenau, or something like that. A-And he writes about those \u2014 those children, and \u2014 and he \u2014 and he writes about those hundred and \u2014 there is a page for \u2014 for every one of those hundred, and they are still in England, the ones who are alive, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection RG-50.030*0580 76 most of them are alive, and they are still in England. So this was \u2014 this was what I knew, that little, in the \u2014 in the camp, and \u2014 and the later, because I just met people from there and we were comparing notes on some occasion. Just how I learned, I thought that Dina Gottliebova is a \u2014 a \u2014 a\u2014I said that the-there was a \u2014 once, I said [indecipherable] I said \u2014 somebody sa \u2014 oh, I see you have a number from Birkenau. I said yes. So I say, I see you have a number, too. So, yes, yes, I was there, in the Familienlager. And I said, there is someone on my mind that said, I will probably never find out what happened to her. She was sent, so I thought she 1s going with \u2014 she is going with Mengele, she probably knows much more than the rest of us do. And probably \u2014 and \u2014 and she was sad. This also \u2014 this also doesn\u2019t allow me much hope. She \u2014 she [indecipherable] to \u2014 had a husband, Rudy, and \u2014 and she says he is talking about Dina Gottliebova. Bobbit. I was in contact with her later on, and Bobbit \u2014 Bobbit is a \u2014 is \u2014 is her husband\u2019s \u2014 her husband\u2019s name. And she was fighting to get the \u2014 to get some \u2014 she was also somebody who not \u2014 admired her boss. And this is \u2014 she admired things about Mengele. Things were coming all the time. When she talked abou \u2014 about Mengele, some kind of pride came into her voice, you know? Like she would make an example. She says, I made his portrait, she says. She was doing many portraits for his friends as gifts. And \u2014 and then six or seven of those Gypsy paintings, and the wall, which 1s probably in Israel, in Yad Vashem, the \u2014 the wall \u2014 the wall the seven dwarfs, that\u2019s what the RG-50.030*0580 77 children wanted \u2014 wanted once they were there, in the Familienlager. They were in a room, and she painted it. And \u2014 and, so the seven dwarfs. And actually, she married the man who was the author of one of the seven dwarfs, which is Bobbitt. So, we are now with the \u2014 so I thought that there is no survival. There 1s absolutely, there is absolutely no survival. And \u2014"

But my friends were there, and as a matter of fact, they are in Montreal and now he re-retired as a \u2014 an \u2014 and he 1s writing his third book in Czech, about those times, about a re \u2014 reminiscences. He 1s \u2014 their children are \u2014 were from childhood, with what happened, involved writing poetry on those sa \u2014 things. My children, I protected them as much as I could, especially since I lost her \u2014 their mother at the age of nine and 12. This is my daughter, she was nine when my \u2014 when my wife has died. So, the number \u2014 I said this is a telephone number, and so on. Til today they don\u2019t know. Part of the fact that the family is meeting together here and I am giving the testimony and will try also to leave the testimony for my family out there. This is the same, this \u2014 thi-this is part why we are here. But just an aside, that it\u2019s good for the children to know rather to not know, because they \u2014 they know anyhow, but in some dark and untouchable way. What \u2014 what happened \u2014 Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection RG-50.030*0580 78 what happened later on, I was lucky again. There was a \u2014 they were supposed to \u2014 to e-empty the Zigeunerlager, and I don\u2019t know \u2014 I don\u2019t know the \u2014 how \u2014 how those minds worked, but Willie was interested in my survival. Karl was nice to me. I-It\u2019s \u2014n-nobody bother me. I \u2014 I could help others. I knew two boys, and their father was put in \u2014 into a \u2014 into that \u2014 the same block where I was, and they wanted to get the father out, and they gave me a\u2014 a diamond, I didn\u2019t want the diamond. And I went to \u2014 to one of the Dutch people that I knew, and I ask him for a couple of sardine boxes, so they can bribe the \u2014 the blockalteste. They went, they bribed, they got the father out. Later they were \u2014 they were all going from some \u2014 on some assignment to work, hopefully. I gave him back the diamond and he accepted it. And \u2014 so the idea is, if I could, somebody was in the krankenbau, in the hospital, I will bring in a metal container, food. But at one time the guard shot down the line. I \u2014 I was startled, and I got electrified, and \u2014 and fell out while \u2014 while this happened. I also was [indecipherable] flowing back, and disconnected, but it \u2014 1t was a fe \u2014 quite a feeling to \u2014 to be the \u2014 I was going to \u2014 to look for Mrs. Feldman, who was the head of the orphanage before, that \u2014 the same orphanage. And she was not \u2014 she is an artist, a known person in my life, felt fine. Mrs. Feldstein. And I \u2014 I found other people. They asked me for warm underwear, and \u2014 and I would be bringing to the people warm underwear. One of them had the relative in Montreal, who said that her underwear that I brought saved her life. Whatever. It \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s probably RG-50.030*0580 79 misconception with some people that it was dog eat dog and only dog eat dog. It wasn\u2019t. People were doing things when they could. I did too. It was almost something pushing me do something good, since, you know, like \u2014 so \u2014 so this was the time, and \u2014 but I don\u2019t understand why Willie was so nice to me, after \u2014 after trying to \u2014 to \u2014 to get me to be his plaything or whatever. He \u2014 he wasn\u2019t rough, or he wasn\u2019t this. Talked to his dog that I am not a good boy. And \u2014 and later he is \u2014 and I am \u2014 as the camp was going to be emptied, I am getting a letter from an SS, probably the same officer, who I never, ever saw again. And that letter \u2014 with that letter, I was sent to Sosnowice. And in Sosnowice \u2014 in Sosnowice, I arrived and I gave the letter to the commandant of the camp. And he says, if you were look \u2014 you were good enough to be a runner in \u2014 in Birkenau, you are good enough to be a runner for me. One of the strangest things happened; if somebody would make a film, I would be the first one to say this is impossible: I was \u2014 I was running, stoking the fires in all the SS have their barracks, I was stoking the \u2014 stoking the fire and \u2014 and all that; ea-eating sometimes from the \u2014 from the SS kitchen. Everybody knew me, it was a small camp. I said that I was interested to see the machinery, always interested me, machinery [indecipherable]. So I went for one shift, commandant praising me that I am interested. So I \u2014 I went to \u2014 to the factory. I liked what I saw. Poles were working together with the Jews from the camp, the relations were this. I didn\u2019t see a Pole for years, five years, well, at that time. And it was very nice, I ti\u2014I RG-50.030*0580 80 fell a little bit in love with one Polish woman who was in the center of the factory, writing things down, reading poetry, so we have something \u2014 something in common. She was talking something, so the youngsters that I said are running away they say, to \u2014 to the [indecipherable] to Warsaw, actually go into the forest, talking that maybe I can go into the forest, but I will have to avoid the \u2014 the Polish partisans and go 30 kilometers. It\u2019s \u2014 I made a little reading lamp in the workshop of the camp, for the commandant, an SS man, a young SS man sees me and he says, oh, did you do it? And I said yes. So \u2014 so I say, take it. So he says, no, I will \u2014 di \u2014 you made it for the \u2014 for the commandant, no I will not take it. So I say okay, so I will make you another one. I \u2014 I make him \u2014 I made him another one later on. This is the young one, who was later killing people on that \u2014 on that road and sharing the bread with me, and other things, which \u2014 which help me to survive. There was another SS man there from Austria, who was crying his head off because he didn\u2019t hear from his wife, and he thought maybe they were bombed, a-and \u2014 and I \u2014 I put my arm on him, saying that the \u2014 maybe the post doesn\u2019t work or things.

Okay, he got to be a commandant in Dachau, so he is not a gent-gentle \u2014 as a matter of fact, so gentle, his family, like, they adopted me. I was running around the camp, I had the movement. The telephone was ringing in the \u2014 in the office, I would pick it up and say, this is Camp Sosnowice, so and so, and take a message. And \u2014 and now it looked to me \u2014 show it to me in a film and I don\u2019t believe it, you know? That \u2014 so this was the true. But \u2014 but that\u2019s how it was, that was the thing. I \u2014 I was a \u2014 a \u2014 decorating the \u2014 the Christmas tree. I took every candy out, as a joke, and \u2014 and have only empty candies there, I didn\u2019t need the candies. But it was a joke, and it was accepted as a joke, but where did I come to do this [indecipherable] but I did survive. The \u2014 the gift that I brought to the commandant that I made, was packed as a gift from \u2014 from me. The family had gifts \u2014 gifts for me for Passover. It\u2019s a \u2014 it was a crazy time out, a-at crazy times, crazy places. Sosnowice was different, separate from \u2014 from anything else you \u2014 you \u2014 you can say. Nobody was \u2014"

            "answer": "They were \u2014 they were in \u2014 in Sosnowice, they had to march a certain dis- distance, and oh \u2014 oh \u2014 oh yes, I \u2014 when they started to tear with running away to \u2014 to the partisans, I \u2014 I asked the \u2014 the commandant to be \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to free me from my duties, because I want to learn a trade, to be useful. And he stopped the whole column and praised me, because \u2014 and I actually wanted to see \u2014 to give a chance to run away, and \u2014 and to see her more often. She was much older, with knowing eyes, she knew exactly what it\u2019s doing to me. I was the hungry. I was rested. It\u2019s \u2014 so, that was \u2014 that was \u2014 so one morning \u2014 one morning, everything is packed. I didn\u2019t have to worry any more what choice I am making, it was a difficult choice to be courageous, to run away. I didn\u2019t know if I had the courage. And we started to \u2014 to [indecipherable] at Gliwice, the commandant unloaded his stuff, his furniture, and \u2014 and it occurred to me that I will ask him that \u2014 maybe to hide in the furniture and I will help the family later on. But I chickened out on that as well. After \u2014 after that, that young SS man was crazy, the \u2014 going around and shooting people; he had so much energy. He brought me \u2014 at the end of the day he brought me his coat, spattered with blood, to wash out the blood. And I was washing out the blood, and felt sick over it, brought it to a place where \u2014 where they \u2014 where the SS were sleeping on the floor with \u2014 with \u2014 and there was a panzerfaust or something, you know, a grenade, and I thought \u2014 I thought if I will grab the grenade and throw it, maybe we\u2019ll change our \u2014 because we could hear the Russians in the back. And \u2014 RG-50.030*0580 83 anyhow, I didn't know how to actuate it. It\u2019s \u2014 Is \u2014 I saw a movie only recently where \u2014 about a school for SS, and said that you unscrew the bottom. So for half a century I didn\u2019t know how I could have done it, but I saw the movie, right, yeah, now, now. So, and \u2014 and that way we came to Mauthausen. Mauthausen was \u2014 was \u2014 I had, from sleeping on the ground, I had four large furuncles. I couldn\u2019t bring it down. I went through the selection, because it was in \u2014 in two days it swelled up more and more. We had the \u2014 the \u2014 that thing written, that\u2019s me \u2014 somebody was going around writing down the names of the ones who have to go to the hospital. The hospital actually was the Russian lager, and actually it was a place where they kill people. Put people in, and bottles of chlorinated water, phenol injections, al-all kind of things. So, on the way \u2014 and this might be of interest, on \u2014 on the way there, there is the lageralteste from \u2014 from Sosnowice, and the lageralteste was \u2014 was a \u2014 a delegate to the \u2014 to the Reichsdeutsche\u2019s Reichstag, wha-whatever the na \u2014 the name was. And \u2014 and he was held in very high esteem by the raportfuehrer. I heard what\u2019s going on, the bombing, because the two of them talked, and \u2014 and later I saw this lageralteste, but he was hiding his \u2014 his red \u2014 red triangle, because the \u2014 the kapos in Mauthausen were criminals, and not political. And \u2014 and this kapo criminal was actually in charge of the Jehovah Witnesses. They have some tailoring blocks, or whatever. So he talked \u2014 he talked to \u2014 to that kapo as we pass. My group was halted, and \u2014 and they\u2019d say talk to the Yugoslav, and I was brought to that \u2014 to RG-50.030*0580 84 that hospital, which I didn\u2019t know, only that it\u2019s not a good place. I didn\u2019t know that I will go to death. And some SS put me on a table from \u2014 from stone, and he started to cut and I started to faint. He sprayed something and I fainted again. And I was brought to the block. I was brought to \u2014 I don\u2019t know when and how I was brought to the block."

We were there maybe a couple of days, I don\u2019t know, it was very, very cold, freezing at that time. And later they brought us over to a\u2014 toa [indecipherable] lager.

What he didn\u2019t know, he couldn\u2019t have known, that near the barracks now are those tents, and the bombs fell into the tents. So, there was that all over, and pieces of flesh. There was no place for everybody in the tent. Flesh on the wires around that. The next day there was \u2014 there were cooking fires, that the people still had utensils from their trip. Kaduk(ph), a raportfuehrer from Auschwitz was going around. Wherever he saw something in a pot which was suspicious, he would kick it over and shoot a few people.

Later on, there was no \u2014 there were no bombs, and you could see missing buttocks on people still alive, still RG-50.030*0580 87 the \u2014 the mouth is still moving.

I crawled down, I couldn\u2019t come back. Remained there near the \u2014 near the dig-out, which was from before, with feces and so on, and \u2014 and in the rain. And \u2014 and the Americans came.

And I don\u2019t remember how long I was RG-50.030*0580 92 there to \u2014 to continue a story just a little bit beyond, 1s when I could, I got a paper from the \u2014 from the city hall, by an American, and who wa \u2014 who was there in city hall, to \u2014 to afford me a assistance as I look for my mother, because there was still time for illusion about her right away then. So, I-I \u2014 I-I was \u2014 I was going around with that paper, and then I see a group of people [indecipherable] you have to sleep over, eat something. They were going to Switzerland, and they told me to \u2014 to \u2014 to lower my age, because they were supposed to take youngsters to \u2014 to \u2014 to Switzerland, about the school \u2014 school level, a certain school level. They didn\u2019t know much either about what was happening. School level. So she told me, just put \u2014 put less [indecipherable]. And I was later on those \u2014 I was stumbling over those dates. Once you have a piece of paper, everything starts to emanate from the piece of paper, and \u2014 and then you leave it alone, and then you find su \u2014 as I, that I was going around with a \u2014 a incorrect date, which, it shouldn\u2019t matter much."

Okay, and \u2014 and they were \u2014 and \u2014 and some of the English are the ones that jer \u2014 Gilbert is writing about from the boys of Birkenau. Now, th-the next legation was American. As \u2014 so I had to sleep over, and so on. They were encourage \u2014 they didn\u2019t have enough \u2014 enough youngsters. They all came out with a goodwill gesture, but they didn\u2019t have enough, at this area, there, they didn\u2019t have RG-50.030*0580 93 enough young people survivor that they can \u2014 that\u2019s why they say \u2014 say \u2014 say that you are less in age. And then I saw a soldier, a soldier surrounded by people, speaking Yiddish. A pole that here was written Palestine. And then I rem \u2014 then I remember how I talked to him at length, or where \u2014 when there was a chance I waited out a \u2014 the crowd and so on. He told me the best way to find relatives is to go to Israel, once they have a specialized \u2014 a specialized facility, they call it mabrodliki(ph) puskravym(ph), the Institute for Finding Relatives. And \u2014 and then, you know, you don\u2019t have a telephone, you don\u2019t have this, you don\u2019t have communication. You \u2014 it \u2014 it really, it has to be a chance once to a thousands that you touch base with someone who knows something. As \u2014 an-and then, I remember that during the war we also said that if we separate, then \u2014 then those people will be our contact. So I went to Israel, and that\u2019s where I was for 11 years. I was there a student, I was a volunteer in the pel-mah(ph). I was later a \u2014 a teacher, for some three years. My wife was from Canada, we \u2014 we were not sure where we will be, but decided to give one year to Canada, which with the birth of my son and so on, turned into a permanent thing. So \u2014 so that \u2014 that\u2019s what happened after the \u2014 the \u2014 that means the fact that \u2014 that I found myself in Canada."
