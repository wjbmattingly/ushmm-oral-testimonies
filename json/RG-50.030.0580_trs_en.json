I never found him, and there was like between the blocks, you \u2014 you had like a promenade. There was a time that you were in between things, and you could walk back and forth. And I don\u2019t know if it was the same day, or the second day or the third day or the fourth day. After a very short time, all at once, everybody on one section of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the promenade is being like taken \u2014 taking 1n a gauntlet, and put into a block, and some \u2014 some people, like stronger people would be put aside, but small people, and old people, who \u2014 who somehow \u2014 some of them were [indecipherable] for some time \u2014 I was new \u2014 were pushed into \u2014 into that block, op-opposite the 14 block.

On the last night, when \u2014 when they were taking out all the people from Theresienstadt, it was Willie, and his friend Karl, and probably contacts that he had, which allowed him to bring approximately a hundred \u2014 hundred people \u2014 hundred young men from \u2014 from the Theresienstadt out into our end. And so they avoided being th-th-they \u2014 th-they remained alive. So yeah, her brother could have been \u2014 her brother survived this particular person. But so \u2014 an-and then there was a dispute with those people. What hundred people, what are you sa \u2014 talking about? Only 22, we were the only ones who remained, 22. My friend, he\u2019s a psychiatrist, and he was in this. And I said, no, there were a hundred, I was there.

And I said, there is someone on my mind that said, I will probably never find out what happened to her. She was sent, so I thought she 1s going with \u2014 she is going with Mengele, she probably knows much more than the rest of us do. And probably \u2014 and \u2014 and she was sad.

When she talked abou \u2014 about Mengele, some kind of pride came into her voice, you know? Like she would make an example. She says, I made his portrait, she says. She was doing many portraits for his friends as gifts.

I knew two boys, and their father was put in \u2014 into a \u2014 into that \u2014 the same block where I was, and they wanted to get the father out, and they gave me a\u2014 a diamond, I didn\u2019t want the diamond.

They went, they bribed, they got the father out. Later they were \u2014 they were all going from some \u2014 on some assignment to work, hopefully. I gave him back the diamond and he accepted it.

He \u2014 he wasn\u2019t rough, or he wasn\u2019t this. Talked to his dog that I am not a good boy. And \u2014 and later he is \u2014 and I am \u2014 as the camp was going to be emptied, I am getting a letter from an SS, probably the same officer, who I never, ever saw again.
