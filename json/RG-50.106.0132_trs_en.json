On the other hand, we did have a Christmas tree, supposedly for the staff, to honor them. I remember going to temple. I tried to find the temple when I was in Vienna, but the only temple that we located was one that was closed. And later on when I talked to one of my distant relatives, I was told that there were several temples and that probably was not the one that I attended as a child."

I don\u2019t remember my grandmother being -- bringing up religion in any way. We did have religious training though, but the religious training came because in Vienna at the time religion was part of the curriculum, and since we were Jewish, that was not given in the schools.

Frankly, I don\u2019t remember presents as such as part of a traditional festivity. I know I got my first gold ring because I ate some meat, which I refused to eat previously. And I remember that whenever my parents went to Paris, because my mother bought most of her wardrobe there, they would bring us back -- and clothes were always uppermind -- in my mind, even as a little girl, and I remember that. But I -- I -- I don\u2019t remember any presents as such that were particularly meaningful to me. I remember as a little girl I had little dolls that I liked.

I was never allowed to even cross the street by myself or walk any place by myself. My biggest pleasure was that my mother once took me on the bus.

And in Vienna the oldest child had a lot of privileges that the younger child didn\u2019t have. So I was very annoyed at that. She was allowed to go at night to the opera, I was not. She was allowed to go to bed later, I was not. She was allowed a lot of fe -- also, I had a lot of hand-me-down dresses from her, which I terribly resented.

We had -- the only set of friends that I remember were two boys, and I absolutely detested the younger one, because he was my age, and adored the older one, who was supposedly my sister\u2019s friend.

            "answer": "Yes, many times. Movies bring it back. I -- | remember vividly one movie with Jane Fonda and the ride on the train, where she was smuggling some anti-Nazi material or something, and all of a sudden I felt what I felt on the train when I was seven years old. And there are other movies. I -- I -- I saw a movie with my friend Jeanette there th -- see, we -- there are certain va -- basic things. You asked me previously, did we ever talk about our past experience. And we rarely did. It was much more of that we knew and we felt the same thing. It\u2019s very hard to explain. I saw the movie east w -- East West with her. And frankly it\u2019s not really related to the Holocaust, but all because it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s Russia and it\u2019s France, but the oppression and the fear and all that, and -- and we both said we were so happy that we didn\u2019t see it with anybody else but each other, because we both knew exactly how we felt and what disturbed us and what -- you can never get rid of that fear. Even today I am petrified when I see a policeman in a car when I am driving. I totally always do a big sigh of relief when he passes me and doesn\u2019t stop me. Even though I know I\u2019m not speeding, I\u2019m not doing anything, I\u2019m just plain riding a car. It\u2019s unbelievable. Never ceases. And that\u2019s probably partially the reason that I hate, detest guns, detest any sort of violence, cannot stand violence in any form and really do not read a newspaper. And even when I listen to the news, I automatically shut them off.

But -- I mean, my friend Mimi has been in therapy for many years, and is no longer, but that\u2019s the one who lost her two friends in the Holocaust. We all -- we -- I feel we are all marked. There is no question on that. I even sometimes feel my son is marked, because I raised him, and some of my reactions to raising him. Either that or it\u2019s inherited, I don\u2019t know.
