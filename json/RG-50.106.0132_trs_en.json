I don\u2019t remember my grandmother being -- bringing up religion in any way. We did have religious training though, but the religious training came because in Vienna at the time religion was part of the curriculum, and since we were Jewish, that was not given in the schools. So I remember we had a Hebrew teacher coming to the house, teaching us Hebrew and religion."

Frankly, I don\u2019t remember presents as such as part of a traditional festivity. I know I got my first gold ring because I ate some meat, which I refused to eat previously. And I remember that whenever my parents went to Paris, because my mother bought most of her wardrobe there, they would bring us back -- and clothes were always uppermind -- in my mind, even as a little girl, and I remember that. But I -- I -- I don\u2019t remember any presents as such that were particularly meaningful to me. I remember as a little girl I had little dolls that I liked. And I think when Hitler came I could take a few with me, I don\u2019t remember. But somehow they disappeared. But I don\u2019t remember like having had a specific toy that Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg \u2018 July 29, 2000 I was attached to, like my little granddaughter now 1s with -- with Minnie Mouse. I - | don\u2019t remember that. Maybe I blacked it out. I -- I can\u2019t remember."

            "answer": "Okay, we went -- we did not attend private school, we attended the public school, and I remember the greatest embarrassment was that we were brought there with the car and the chauffeur and I was very embarrassed about not being able to walk to school like the other children. I was never allowed to even cross the street by myself or walk any place by myself. My biggest pleasure was that my mother once took me on the bus. That was a big excitement for me because the car I -- I kind of disliked riding in the car, because I used to get carsick a lot."

We did go to a private dancing school, and we did have piano lessons in the house with a piano teacher. But I -- and I also remember coming to the house, we had the governesses that were supposed to instruct us in Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Dorrit L.

And in Vienna the oldest child had a lot of privileges that the younger child didn\u2019t have. So I was very annoyed at that. She was allowed to go at night to the opera, I was not. She was allowed to go to bed later, I was not. She was allowed a lot of fe -- also, I had a lot of hand-me-down dresses from her, which I terribly resented.

Ostberg \u201d July 29, 2000 from one cheek to the other. And I had an uncle who always touched me at the cheek and said for me to eat. And I would forever sit and eat, from morning to night, because I was underweight, I had asthma -- I was an asthmatic child, and the governesses were told that we had to eat, that I particularly had to eat. So they kept me at the table s -- what seems to me still hours and hours.

It meant to be -- to be excluded while the -- while the other children in the elementary school had their Catholic instruction. And I knew I was Jewish. It didn\u2019t mean a great deal, I think, as far as tradition.

And on Saturday and Sunday, I remember a little bit of my father playing with us, maybe. A very little, very little interplay.

I was absolutely much too strict about a certain concept. I still remember being with my brother-in-law and one of the anecdotes were that they had a radiologist who was teaching the internist and he would say -- he would show them Slides, and he would say, what is this on the slide? And the man would say, it\u2019s a kidney. And he would say it\u2019s excellent, excellent answer. Wonderful answer. It would be better if you had said it was the liver. So, I never forgot that because I used to get sick when they didn\u2019t remember a formula. And I used to be angry and they had to memorize the formula. It was stupid. I mean, what does a formula do? Absolutely nothing. A kidney and a liver, if he takes it out, that means a lot. So I -- that was the bad part. The good part was that I had -- since I went back to Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Dorrit L.

And I understood of them blacking out and being afraid and -- and not being able to achieve. That I was good at. I was also very gullible. I had a kid that told me his father -- he couldn\u2019t do his homework because his father was dying of cancer, I was in tears, I -- I told him how my sister died and everything. I ran down to -- oh, he got in trouble with me, he almost hit me. So he was -- he was -- w-w-we -- I was in front of the assistant principal and he said, you know, this kid, he lies a lot. You see what position you put me? I have to call the father now and see whether the mother or whatever -- th-the mother now and see whether the father is really dying. You know something? He made it all up, this kid. Made the whole story up. So there are things that were good and things that were bad."
