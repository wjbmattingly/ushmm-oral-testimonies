            "answer": "Bivolari was one of the small villages established in the late 1800's. It consisted of one main street, unpaved and a perpendicular one called the Armenian Alley, or in Yiddish, the Kribbe Gass (ph), at the end of which, the Jewish community of 200 families, approximately a thousand people, built an Israeli, Israelita Romana (ph) or public school, no, elementary school. The communal bath was there, the matzo factory, the . . . a few other institutions. And we lived happily as children in the little village, surrounded by about five, six thousand peasants. They would come . . . the street was one after another, little shops, ateliers. The Jewish community consisted of all sorts of... what do you call them? Occupations, there were tailors and cobblers and bakers and other such. And stores, of which my parents occupied one in the middle of the street, the middle of the village. On Mondays, Sundays and Mondays, the peasants would come with their produce and sell it for such people who would then accumulate it and send it up to other, larger cities and with the money the peasants would buy what the Jews had for sale. 01:04:06 Previously there were hard times so that when I came on the scene, the atmosphere was relaxed but cautious and nobody ventured out of the city by himself or late at night. It was a nice arrangement, we lived during the day, we stay indoors at night. And we were not then. . .. The city, the village, was bordering, about half a mile from a river called Prut, and later that Prut became the border between Romania and Russia."

I would work in the store and also catch up on my schooling that I had to neglect before, and there was the Jewish, larger Jewish community, a larger school, with all grades up to the 12th grade and there they had special programs for such students that missed the regular grades and we were able to graduate two classes in one year.

            "answer": "Yes, oh Iasi, it was part of a large community and the Jewish community, the town approached 100,000. Here we come from a place with 900 people, from Bivolari. In many other small places, the Jewish moved to Iasi. Not by order, but that was the natural choice. That's where we always traveled to do things that were missing in Bivolari. Even to go to theater or to movies, we would drive or ride to Iasi. Antisemitism, in Iasi it was already open, and we arrived in '39, time went by, until June 21, 1941, when Hitler invaded Russia and of course that was 50 miles from Iasi, where we used to live, in Bivolari, they crossed the Prut.\u201d We were shaking at the sight of tanks and soldiers and this tense situation and sure enough, within a week, on June 29th, there was a big pogrom in Iasi. The authorities, the Rumanian authorities, issued an order that all Jews must come to the city place, city hall to obtain identification cards or exchange any that they might have had. My brothers went and my father and myself stayed home, he said, \"No, we will wait until everybody else got their cards and then we'll go.\u201d And sure enough when the people arrived there for cards they were surrounded and enclosed in a large yard, an outdoor movie house all walled in by stone walls, and shooting started. My brothers were among the first to come so they were settled by the wall and they were able to jump the wall and start looking for shelter. They found it in a Shed of wood, firewood piled all the way to the ceiling, but they were able to remove the top level, crawl in and replace the front so that whenever soldiers came by, they could see wood, firewood. Myself and father at home in this apartment lived about 30, 40 Jewish families. A large building with a large basement, but unfinished, just a cellar, and that cellar had five, six exits or entries, such that when they came to look for us in one entrance, mothers, female, women, were able to send them away that we already went to the city hall and send us to the other corner of the basement and vice versa, wherever they came from. They came to see that everybody went to get their ID cards and this way we ran through and could see what's going on outside, but we escaped. 01:21:23"

They stopped shooting in the morning and about 11,000 people were still alive. They marched them to the train station and packed them into cattle cars and started traveling them from Iasi to Podu Iloaiei again and again, back and forth. And every now and then they would pour lime, which give off the fumes that killed of the 12,000 about half or three- quarters of them, died on the pogrom.\u2019 My uncle was one of them. Some of our friends were in the trains. And the others came out completely disoriented, they didn't know where they were, what they were and it took some doing to find them. In the meantime it quieted down * June 22, 1941.

But then the Germans went on to Russia and we remained to reorganize. Now the Rumanians asked all the Jewish families to supply one person for volunteer hard labor. In my family, I was the volunteer. Why? Because in a round-up of such, they ask for a bookkeeper, anybody knows how to keep books. My brother raised his hand, but he meant to send me and so I worked as a volunteer on hard, or forced labor in a military hospital, formerly a Jewish hospital, but at this time they took it over. In the offices of course, the officer in charge of bookkeeping had difficulties staying sober or keeping books and so he found me, his savior. He could pick me out because at this point we had curfew at six, seven o'clock, in evening or early in the morning, so he would come and pick me up, keep me until late hours and take me home. 01:26:06"

In Cyprus, they took my violin away and indicated that you will get it back when you leave, but that's another story, I never left through the gates.

Sorry, I was in the summer camp, the winter camps were inland, Limassol -- 30, 40 miles away, in the capital, outside the capital I believe, Larnaca a greek city, inland. This Famagusta in Cyprus 1s on the northern part of Cyprus. It is across the Turkish border, about 20, 30 miles of water in between.

We started with the help of Israeli shlichim'*, we started preparing paramilitary organizations and training and studying Hebrew and engaging or preparing to engage in escape from the camps. The camps were serviced by the British, but they employed Greek, Greeks for cleaning the camps, providing provisions to the camp, so there was a daily 'S There were five camps near Famagusta and seven outside of Larnaca.

By now we were organized with representatives from Israel and we were called the Haganah, and with contacts with these Greeks that like us in Israel, were trying to get rid of the British control of the island. So in exchange of their help for our escapees, for every one of us, they received a gun that the Israelis brought from Israel. That's the curiosity of arms tradings, the Israelis would buy them from the British and give them to the Greeks, so they can fight the British. That's how armaments travel. 02:11:07 But we engaged in, first of all, observations of their movements. The camps were surrounded by two fences of barbed wire and in between, this concertina barbed wire rows. And we began to escape through the barbed wire. My specialty was to crawl into the concertina, so that when we split it, it doesn't start running away, because every 50 meters there were guards posted on towers. So this is where we started taking out youngsters of military age, every week, every night, eight to 10 people, bringing back the wires and tying up the fence back so that nothing can be suspected. As the youngsters left the fence, they would walk to a road where the Greeks would pick them up and take them to an orange grove, many orange groves around there, and house them for a time, when we had 40, 50 escapees collected together. At that point, Israeli fisherman would come, with permits to fish in Turkish waters and by pre-arrangement with lights and signs, we were able to board them and take them on little fishing boats, to Israel. Many times we were caught by the British and the punishment for that was to interrogate you, for which they always got the same response, that nobody organizes us, we just get together and decide to leave. The punishment was to transfer you to the other camps. We thought we would be strangers there, but there we were waited for and after a month or so we would do the same thing there, so that in punishment we would be returned. After several times and many funny exploits, it turned out that the safest place to escape was through their camps. They would be sleeping in tents the British and we would pass through there and get out of the camps. Right through the fence, just the fence that bordered to their encampment. 02:14:44"

And other escapades, we dug a tunnel. We lived in tents and a few, some British huts, metal huts, but they were for tables and for mess halls and half of them we filled with the soil that we dug out from the tunnels. And we took out about 1000 youngsters this way and one night I indicated that I'm not coming back and I tied up that fence from the outside and joined the 10 people that we left. After a few nights there, stayed locked up in these orange groves during the day and at night they let us out, roam around 1f we wanted.
