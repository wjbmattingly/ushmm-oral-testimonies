In 194 _, since July, 1913, they called the Germans camp to the Jewish quarter and th ey ask the men they should come with their license to be present in that building. That building was the headquarter of the pilots, the officer, the aviation. I should do that before. Then the men they went there for three days. After three days, they start to ask all the women and the children, they should come too and to bring all the possession they had, the silver, the money, the gold to bring in toge ther. Then they would stay all day long there, they would stay long in -- they would be in one building, in one village. Your money, you will support yourselves. I should start like this. From there they took us after three days, they gave the alarm and we went to walking like a caravan like you see in the movie, they walking with all the belonging together like blankets, pillows, all the clothes, wh atever they had. Luggage, together and we went to the boat and after five days we arrive in Pireo and from Pireo they took us to Athens where the camp was ther e waiting for the train, for the wagons. We stayed in that place, that camp they call Haidari. We stayed three days there in the Haidari and after they put us in the wagons.

Manos S______.The three men pass away because was thirsty and they died. They throw in one hole over there. After we start -- they hided us for many days. During the day, we was hiding.

            "answer": "Yes, in the train we was with all my fa mily; my father, my mother. My father, he used to read the perck, not the perck, the -- some part of the tehillin (psalms). He used to read continuously, continuously, continuously until we arrived. My mother, she was sitting there. We didn\u2122t have room to move. We didn\u2122t have no toilets. We didn\u2122t have nothing. My brot hers, my sister, my brother-in-law, even we want to make our necessity and we sa y, turn your face. In the same train, in the same people, in the same where we were sitting because they didn\u2122t have no room. My three nephews, my sister-in-law, she was very young, twenty-five years old. Her little girl was a year and a half. My brother at that time was 28 years, I don\u2122t know. My father was 71, my mother 60, 61 when they arrive in Auschwitz. They promise us we will s ee every night. During the day, they will go to work. But was not like that. Only we heard by the French when we smell the meat, barbecue. They used to look like th ey have steak in the -- steak barbecue. We say, look they eating barbecue with the music and the French people what was over there before us, they say no. They are your parents, they are cremated. At that time, we didn\u2122t know what mean cremated. Because in our country, in our little island, we was very na\u00efve. We kne w what means cremation because in our Bible they say cremated, cremation is against the law We never thought they 14would cremated those people. My brother, they took my brothers and my brotherin-law, they choose to work and also myself. But my brother Josef went to Mauthausen, Nissim was in Dachau, my br other-in-law was in Rideltow and those things I find out because I wrote to Red Cross. They answered me and they told me where they was dead. That is the r eason I know where I lost my brothers. Myself, I was working in Villestadt before for two months, years. I was working in Auschwitz bringing barrels of food to the kitchen or bring water to the kitchen. After breaks, after they send us to Villestadt. Was factory of munition. My job was gleeov. I can\u2122t translate what mean gleeov. The only thing I know was a big trunk. I put pieces of metal. The mach ine gun I don\u2122t know. Put it there and then put it in the \u0152 in one place, 500 mil kilo watt to make hard. Every 20 minute, I have to change the trunk and put the other. In the meantime, the 20 minute until they would be cool off. I used to help the other girls who they couldn\u2122t make it. We worked 12 hours daily for one week. One night, 12 hours. Tachi and Nachi they used to call. But we never saw when was daytime. When was nighttime because we was working under tunnel. We never saw sunshine. We never saw the time, what time, what day. We di dn\u2122t know nothing. We was working like slave until the Russian they start to come and they move us in other place to work in pieces of assembly of ai rplane. We stayed there thre e, four days or one week. From there they took us another place. They put in the wagons, almost the end I think. They left us in wagons, closed of Villestadt, no Theresienstadt. They closed the wagons for five days. How ma ny girls was dead and we didn\u2122t have no toilet, no air, only they was lucky with chan. After five days over there, you should see the cholera they have, the cholera. The Russian camp, they liberated us. They say to us, \ufb01kein arbeit, kein brot\ufb02; if you don\u2122t work for you, you can\u2122t have bread. The strong girls, they have to go to work. You have to go. To me, they pick up myself to work in -- to make bread. Another also to make bread. The other in the kitchen to cook so we worked just for us. Some afternoon, we used to go to the Russian commander to clean the rooms and to cook for them. Every time when I used to go there, I used to steal one knife, knife, one fork and one time I stole a little cushion. Until th ey sent us to Prague. From Prague I escaped twice. I went to Budapest to ask help for my friends who was very sick with this dysentery. We started all over."

I have to go to Bremen in Germ any because the American, they used to send soldiers to Germany and the boats empty. The boats, the navy, they used to come back and bring refugees from Germ any. I was in Germany again for three weeks to see those lousy face of Germans. But I never came out from there, from my room. I never going to eat out because I don\u2122t want to hear the steps of the Germans and I don\u2122t want to hear their vo ice. I came -- when the time came we went to the boat, to the navy and so I came to United States, to New York. From New York, I came to Los Angeles, three nights and two days by train. I came to Chicago, the train -- I missed the train. I have to stay another 24 hours there with 17no food, no nothing. Because I didn\u2122t know the language. I didn\u2122t know what to ask to say give me tuna sandwich or cheese sandwich; I didn\u2122t know until I arrived to Los Angeles. When I arrive d to Los Angeles, my aunt she say, you know, I was in the depot. She came to pi ck me up. She say, the first thing, you know, now you are in America. Your name is no Miru any more. We have to go and change to Mary. I say I\u2122m very sorry; my parents they gave me Miru, I want to keep Miru. If you don\u2122t like Miru, call Mary.

I\u2122m the only survive, why you don\u2122t like? I say okay, you call me anything you want and I did like this because I was exhausted from the trains with no food. I came and you start to give me lecture, to say not Miru, Mary! I stay a few months over there, se ven months with my aunt. I didn\u2122t get along. I went -- I took one room with somebody. In the meantime, I didn\u2122t have no money. I brought with me $500 but was eas y to spend. I wrote to Italy. I say when I will work, I will pay you. They send me every month $100. Like that. I can pay $40 and the $60 I can eat and take the carfare. I had more hard time in United States than in Germany. Beca use in Germany I know I was obligated, with no choice. But over here, I couldn\u2122t speak the language, I couldn\u2122t find job and I didn\u2122t have no place to stay. I had very bad life. For one year I was desperate until I decide to go back to Italy. I say I wish to find a job to make my ticket and to go back. A friend of mine, my cousin who I saved from Auschwitz, who got diarrhea, she say come to Seattl e and I will find job for you. I went to Seattle; I start to work but I had hard time because I didn\u2122t know the language. I was working in _______but very hard to explain to me. I took time from the other people to teach me, to tell me what to do and my time also. They fire me. Finally I look in the telephone book, Italia n family, Italian place and I find Eurocity store and I start to work in Euro-c ity store. After five years, I became American citizen. I say, goodbye everyone. I\u2122m going to Europe to see where will be my destiny. I was going to Israel a nd in Israel they have war after war. I say not for me. When I went to Italy, I fi nd out the life was very hard to find job. I say, I will come back to United States. I will work more. When I will have more money, I\u2122ll go back to Israel. That is what I did. Now in the meantime, my health is no good. My health is very deteriorated."
