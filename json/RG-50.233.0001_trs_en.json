            "question": "Okay let\u2019s begin by -- if you can tell me your name.",
            "answer": "Yes. My name is Miru Alcana. I was born in the island of Rhodes in 1915 and I was deported in 1944, July 23, 1944. From Rhodes, we spent three days in one building and after they took us to different couple of boats to take us to Pireo and from Pireo we went to Athens. In Athens was a camp of concentration and the name was Haidari. We spent over there three days in Haidari and three of our family, relative, they pass away because was thirsty and they couldn\u2019t survive. The name of this people who pass away was Moselton Hasson, is cousin of my mother. Also Allegra Buroff and her mother. I don\u2019t remember her name. After three days we was in Athens, in Haidari, they put us in wagon like animals with no water, no food. Only they put some bread, very, very hard. They put boxes of little onion, white onions. Also boxes of honey and also something else. We couldn\u2019t eat because the bread was very hard, we can\u2019t chew and besides that no water; how can we eat the honey? How can we eat the onions without water? How we would dump the bread with no water? So we arrive in Auschwitz after three weeks, traveling through the night. Daytime we was hiding different places but we didn\u2019t know where it was. Finally we arrive in Auschwitz but during the trip, three men, they pass away in Serbia. One was Rahamim Galanti, another Alchadef, Yomtov and the other was Yehuda Notrica. Those three mens, they died because they was thirsty. Without water, they couldn\u2019t survive. Finally we arrive Auschwitz. In Auschwitz, they separated from our parents. They told us we would see every night but you young people, you will go to work. Then every night, you will meet your parents. So -- was not like that. The only thing, when we arrive, they choose us for work and they put us in line. In the meantime, we was hungry and thirsty and finally we smelled the meat. Smelled the meat and we said I hope those SS they should choke because they having barbecue, They having broiled steak with music but we didn\u2019t know what was going on. The only thing the other people, the French people who was in line with us, they said, when did you arrive? We say a few hours ago. So there are your parents, are cremated. Cremated, what mean? We don\u2019t know that word, cremated. In our country, we never heard that. They say those people who doesn\u2019t -- that are not too strong to work, they put in the ovens. You can imagine how we feel to hear that. To smell they are burning our parents with the music. Because not to hear the screaming. We start to cry, screaming, nothing we can do. After they start to count and they send us to take shower. After they put in our block, in every -- number 20 the first time. Four o\u2019clock or before, they start to call \u201csel appel, sel appel\u201d That means they have to count. That is the story of Auschwitz and our life. I don\u2019t know what to say else. The only thing when we was working, they choose us to work in the factory. I was working in gleeov but I don\u2019t know how to explain what means gleeov. The only thing was big trunk to put pieces of material to 1 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Just like in one little room where there are 500 kilowatts for twenty minutes. Then after, we have to take out and bring to the other girls to work. Then put the other box over there. That was all the work in Auschwitz. In the meantime, we didn\u2019t have nothing. On Sunday, \u201ckein arbeit kein brot\u201d. They don\u2019t give us anything to eat. But every 12 hours, we was working. They used to give a little soup and one tiny piece of bread. We have to keep for the next day to work. In the meantime, there was people who they steal your bread and nothing you can talk because we couldn\u2019t talk German and we can\u2019t defend ourselves in Yiddish. Really, we have very, very hard life. That is the history of our life."

            "answer": "In Auschwitz I used to go to bring bricks or \u2014 in Auschwitz also the barracks, the food for us. But in Auschwitz we have bitter experience. We used to accept three slice of tiny bread to buy a panty, a brief, a panty. When we washed and we was waiting for a little bit sun. Sun, we never saw in Auschwitz and we tried to put -- to be in the air. The Polish, the grabbed the panty and they go to the blockkova to say, look the Italian, they stole my panty. Was not true, we can\u2019t talk and then the blockkova came. They punish us and they beat us without no reason because we didn\u2019t know the language. We didn\u2019t know Yiddish and we suffered worst than the Hitler. In Germany when I was in Buchenwald, working in the factory, I used to help the other girls. Because they couldn\u2019t do their own job so when I have 20 minutes to rest until the trunk was in the oven; so I used to help some girls to do their own job. I tried to save the girls. Otherwise, they will be killed, they will be cremated. So thank God, they are alive. When I was liberated in Theresienstadt I went to Prague. From Prague, I took the train. I went to Budapest to look for medicines for the girls because they have dysentery. They gave me but before I had problem with -- in the office because they don\u2019t want to give me anything. They say bring your sister here and we will help. I say they are in the hospital. The Russian, they don\u2019t have nothing to help them. I saved them and I want to take home back with me. I spoke with the manager and I say, listen, I came from Prague. I spent three nights and two days and a half in the trains. Now I need help from you. I want to save my sister. I say here is my names. My name is Miru Alcana and they say, what is this. Deanna Galanti, the other. I say they are my sister, my father passed away, my mother got married. So they are Galanti, the other sister, half-sisters. Finally they gave me medicine and also gave me 1,200 merango (130) for each one. I came back to Prague, not to Prague. I find they was in Rattot. I came back. I looked where the Rattot to see where is the camp to meet them again. Finally I have hard time. I don\u2019t know how many 2 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

The other live between -- the other sister she live between Switzerland and France. But when they come to see the sister, we meet each other. What else? Another girl, she live in Johannesburg. She write me and once in a while, she send something, present. At least they recognize what I did for them.

Nurse, I used to do shots for so many people and I used to do tests of the urine for diabetes and albumin. Also I had store one of the best of Rhodes. Perfumeria Rosa di Rodi they used to call. Was a store of classic perfume. For many years, I was very pleased to manage that store But until the Germans -- first of all, when I was -- before that I was working with the government, the manu foreste. But I couldn\u2019t work over there, they say, because I was Jewish so I lost the job. After I went to work in that store where they sell the perfumery. From there I used to go to the hospital to finish the course. In the meantime, I used to make good money for the shots I used to give to people. Also with --. I used to make good money.

But they teach us for little island of Rhodes, no matter how many they used to before teach the boys. The boys they used to send to the chabra or to college, Hebrew college, but the girls, they were not allowed. Only the boys they should. But later they start to teach us, the girls, three hours weekly. Was not so bad. At least we learned something. The most important what we learned, to respect the people, to respect our parents and to know the Ten Commandments, what is very, very important. At the school, they used to teach us Hebrew history and so we continue to keep that in our mind.

            "answer": "I had Italian passport but Rhodes passed to the Greece in 1948. I didn\u2019t want to be Greek. I pick up, I choose to be DP, displaced person to come to the United States. I have to go to Bremen in Germany because the American, they used to send soldiers to Germany and the boats empty. The boats, the navy, they used to come back and bring refugees from Germany. I was in Germany again for three weeks to see those lousy face of Germans. But I never came out from there, from my room. I never going to eat out because I don\u2019t want to hear the steps of the Germans and I don\u2019t want to hear their voice. I came -- when the time came we went to the boat, to the navy and so I came to United States, to New York. From New York, I came to Los Angeles, three nights and two days by train. I came to Chicago, the train -- I missed the train. I have to stay another 24 hours there with 16 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Because I didn\u2019t know the language. I didn\u2019t know what to ask to say give me tuna sandwich or cheese sandwich; I didn\u2019t know until I arrived to Los Angeles. When I arrived to Los Angeles, my aunt she say, you know, I was in the depot. She came to pick me up. She say, the first thing, you know, now you are in America. Your name is no Miru any more. We have to go and change to Mary. I say I\u2019m very sorry; my parents they gave me Miru, I want to keep Miru. If you don\u2019t like Miru, call Mary. First of all I say, Aunt, I got your mother\u2019s name. I\u2019m the only survive who got your mother\u2019s name. We had four Mirus in the family. I\u2019m the only survive, why you don\u2019t like? I say okay, you call me anything you want and I did like this because I was exhausted from the trains with no food. I came and you start to give me lecture, to say not Miru, Mary! I stay a few months over there, seven months with my aunt. I didn\u2019t get along. I went -- I took one room with somebody. In the meantime, I didn\u2019t have no money. I brought with me $500 but was easy to spend. I wrote to Italy. I say when I will work, I will pay you. They send me every month $100. Like that. I can pay $40 and the $60 I can eat and take the carfare. I had more hard time in United States than in Germany. Because in Germany I know I was obligated, with no choice. But over here, I couldn\u2019t speak the language, I couldn\u2019t find job and I didn\u2019t have no place to stay. I had very bad life. For one year I was desperate until I decide to go back to Italy. I say I wish to find a job to make my ticket and to go back. A friend of mine, my cousin who I saved from Auschwitz, who got diarrhea, she say come to Seattle and I will find job for you. I went to Seattle; I start to work but I had hard time because I didn\u2019t know the language. I was working in but very hard to explain to me. I took time from the other people to teach me, to tell me what to do and my time also. They fire me. Finally I look in the telephone book, Italian family, Italian place and I find Euro- city store and I start to work in Euro-city store. After five years, I became American citizen. I say, goodbye everyone. I\u2019m going to Europe to see where will be my destiny. I was going to Israel and in Israel they have war after war. I say not forme. When I went to Italy, I find out the life was very hard to find job. I say, I will come back to United States. I will work more. When I will have more money, I\u2019ll go back to Israel. That is what I did. Now in the meantime, my health is no good. My health is very deteriorated."
