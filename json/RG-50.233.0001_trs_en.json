            "question": "Okay let\u2019s begin by -- if you can tell me your name.",
            "answer": "Yes. My name is Miru Alcana. I was born in the island of Rhodes in 1915 and I was deported in 1944, July 23, 1944. From Rhodes, we spent three days in one building and after they took us to different couple of boats to take us to Pireo and from Pireo we went to Athens. In Athens was a camp of concentration and the name was Haidari. We spent over there three days in Haidari and three of our family, relative, they pass away because was thirsty and they couldn\u2019t survive. The name of this people who pass away was Moselton Hasson, is cousin of my mother. Also Allegra Buroff and her mother. I don\u2019t remember her name. After three days we was in Athens, in Haidari, they put us in wagon like animals with no water, no food. Only they put some bread, very, very hard. They put boxes of little onion, white onions. Also boxes of honey and also something else. We couldn\u2019t eat because the bread was very hard, we can\u2019t chew and besides that no water; how can we eat the honey? How can we eat the onions without water? How we would dump the bread with no water? So we arrive in Auschwitz after three weeks, traveling through the night. Daytime we was hiding different places but we didn\u2019t know where it was. Finally we arrive in Auschwitz but during the trip, three men, they pass away in Serbia. One was Rahamim Galanti, another Alchadef, Yomtov and the other was Yehuda Notrica. Those three mens, they died because they was thirsty. Without water, they couldn\u2019t survive. Finally we arrive Auschwitz. In Auschwitz, they separated from our parents. They told us we would see every night but you young people, you will go to work. Then every night, you will meet your parents. So -- was not like that. The only thing, when we arrive, they choose us for work and they put us in line. In the meantime, we was hungry and thirsty and finally we smelled the meat. Smelled the meat and we said I hope those SS they should choke because they having barbecue, They having broiled steak with music but we didn\u2019t know what was going on. The only thing the other people, the French people who was in line with us, they said, when did you arrive? We say a few hours ago. So there are your parents, are cremated. Cremated, what mean? We don\u2019t know that word, cremated. In our country, we never heard that. They say those people who doesn\u2019t -- that are not too strong to work, they put in the ovens. You can imagine how we feel to hear that. To smell they are burning our parents with the music. Because not to hear the screaming. We start to cry, screaming, nothing we can do. After they start to count and they send us to take shower. After they put in our block, in every -- number 20 the first time. Four o\u2019clock or before, they start to call \u201csel appel, sel appel\u201d That means they have to count. That is the story of Auschwitz and our life. I don\u2019t know what to say else. The only thing when we was working, they choose us to work in the factory. I was working in gleeov but I don\u2019t know how to explain what means gleeov. The only thing was big trunk to put pieces of material to 1 make machine gun; to some electricity to make very, very hard. Just like in one little room where there are 500 kilowatts for twenty minutes. Then after, we have to take out and bring to the other girls to work. Then put the other box over there. That was all the work in Auschwitz. In the meantime, we didn\u2019t have nothing. On Sunday, \u201ckein arbeit kein brot\u201d. They don\u2019t give us anything to eat. But every 12 hours, we was working. They used to give a little soup and one tiny piece of bread. We have to keep for the next day to work. In the meantime, there was people who they steal your bread and nothing you can talk because we couldn\u2019t talk German and we can\u2019t defend ourselves in Yiddish. Really, we have very, very hard life. That is the history of our life."

            "question": "Yeah, what were you doing then when you first heard that the war had broken out?",
            "answer": "In Auschwitz I used to go to bring bricks or \u2014 in Auschwitz also the barracks, the food for us. But in Auschwitz we have bitter experience. We used to accept three slice of tiny bread to buy a panty, a brief, a panty. When we washed and we was waiting for a little bit sun. Sun, we never saw in Auschwitz and we tried to put -- to be in the air. The Polish, the grabbed the panty and they go to the blockkova to say, look the Italian, they stole my panty. Was not true, we can\u2019t talk and then the blockkova came. They punish us and they beat us without no reason because we didn\u2019t know the language. We didn\u2019t know Yiddish and we suffered worst than the Hitler. In Germany when I was in Buchenwald, working in the factory, I used to help the other girls. Because they couldn\u2019t do their own job so when I have 20 minutes to rest until the trunk was in the oven; so I used to help some girls to do their own job. I tried to save the girls. Otherwise, they will be killed, they will be cremated. So thank God, they are alive. When I was liberated in Theresienstadt I went to Prague. From Prague, I took the train. I went to Budapest to look for medicines for the girls because they have dysentery. They gave me but before I had problem with -- in the office because they don\u2019t want to give me anything. They say bring your sister here and we will help. I say they are in the hospital. The Russian, they don\u2019t have nothing to help them. I saved them and I want to take home back with me. I spoke with the manager and I say, listen, I came from Prague. I spent three nights and two days and a half in the trains. Now I need help from you. I want to save my sister. I say here is my names. My name is Miru Alcana and they say, what is this. Deanna Galanti, the other. I say they are my sister, my father passed away, my mother got married. So they are Galanti, the other sister, half-sisters. Finally they gave me medicine and also gave me 1,200 merango (130) for each one. I came back to Prague, not to Prague. I find they was in Rattot. I came back. I looked where the Rattot to see where is the camp to meet them again. Finally I have hard time. I don\u2019t know how many 2 kilometers I walk and finally we was together until we came back to Bologna, Italy altogether. I accomplished something in my life. They recognized what I did for them and we are 1n touch with them. They call me often, one, she live in Vancouver, Washington. The other live in Miami. The other live between -- the other sister she live between Switzerland and France. But when they come to see the sister, we meet each other. What else? Another girl, she live in Johannesburg. She write me and once in a while, she send something, present. At least they recognize what I did for them. I\u2019m satisfied, not what they send me but at least they recognize and they never forget of me. That is all my life. Maybe I got something else but right now I don\u2019t remember. Don\u2019t forget, I\u2019m old lady."

            "answer": "In that time, I was at the hospital study to be midwife but I couldn\u2019t because with the situation of the Jews. They were not allowed to continue to study so I was nurse. Nurse, I used to do shots for so many people and I used to do tests of the urine for diabetes and albumin. Also I had store one of the best of Rhodes. Perfumeria Rosa di Rodi they used to call. Was a store of classic perfume. For many years, I was very pleased to manage that store But until the Germans -- first of all, when I was -- before that I was working with the government, the manu foreste. But I couldn\u2019t work over there, they say, because I was Jewish so I lost the job. After I went to work in that store where they sell the perfumery. From there I used to go to the hospital to finish the course. In the meantime, I used to make good money for the shots I used to give to people. Also with --. I used to make good money. One of the best worker or salelady or employee you can tell was myself because I used to make good, good, good money. After we start with the problem of the Germans so until we finish to be in the hands of the Nazis. Now when I hear still the Nazis is growing up, really I\u2019m getting nervous. I\u2019m sick. But nothing you can do. People, they are cruel, people they don\u2019t know what they want. It is just that they are envy and mean."

I used to help all those girls to cook and to be together because I thought it was my duty to help them because they was orphans, no parents. But I was also without parents but I tried to help them. In the meantime, I used to go to the hospital to see the people who came back from concentration camp was in very bad shape. I used to bring something to them every single day. I used to go to Instituto Rizzoli and also to Santa Orsoladi to hospital to help them. In the meantime, we used to have La Wizo like Hadassah over here, Wizo. We used to - | was very active, I was member and I used to make cookies to have tea, to give tea and then to make money to send to Eretz Israel. Because Israel -- I was very Zionist in my country because my brother was president of the Macabee. My grandparents -- my grandfather died in Jerusalem; my grandmother, also. They were very, very Zionist. Also I continued to be Zionist and I was revisionist in my country in Rhodes. So when I was after the concentration camp, I used to be running from one place to the other to bring cassette, how do you say it? I used to go from one house to the other to bring the keren ami box, the blue box to receive some, to get some money to send to Eretz Israel. Also in this country, I do the same thing. Twice yearly, I have to bring the cassette, the boxes of -- the blue box to the Jewish Fund for Israel. I think for today, I don\u2019t have else what to say. Maybe --."

They gave lots of advice. They teach us how to be human being, to be generous, to be unselfish. At the school, I used to do good work and after the school I used to work. After the school, I used to work. After I finish the school, I went to the hospital to learn midwife but unfortunately, like I will repeat, I didn\u2019t have luck to finish because on account of the religion -- of the Nazis.

But most important, the more classes we had, was Italian subject. Then French, and after Hebrew. Hebrew we have three times weekly for one hour. In fact when I go to Israel, I have no problem with my language because when I studied the dikduk in Hebrew, the only thing I learned with point. I didn\u2019t learn without. But they teach us for little island of Rhodes, no matter how many they used to before teach the boys. The boys they used to send to the chabra or to college, Hebrew college, but the girls, they were not allowed. Only the boys they should. But later they start to teach us, the girls, three hours weekly. Was not so bad. At least we learned something. The most important what we learned, to respect the people, to respect our parents and to know the Ten Commandments, what is very, very important. At the school, they used to teach us Hebrew history and so we continue to keep that in our mind. No matter what we went through in our life, still we keep what we learn from our parents and from the school. That was wonderful experience in our life."

Now here with the Mexicans who hate the Jews and the Protestant, so many people who I met over here, when I find out how they are mean and they hate the Jews, I find out the best is ours. Because we don\u2019t hate no one. Only we respect and so that is the most important. We try to help everyone with no interest but the other religion is just --. They do for interest. Otherwise they don\u2019t do nothing for nothing. I respect my religion and I will die the way I am, this was the best."

When they came to the Jewish quarter, they say we have to bring the men; they have to come with the licenses of their job and then they have to work for us. Every night they will come back. So everyone they took the license of their job. They went there to that building and they didn\u2019t came out. After three days they spoke out again. They came, they say, the womens and the children, they have to come -- they have to go to that building. In case they don\u2019t go, all the mens they will be killed. And they say they have to bring all what you have, gold, money, silver, anything what you got in the house because you will be concentrated in one village. With your money, you will eat and you will be safe. Everyone, they took all the -- what -- all the jewelry, 8 whatever they had, they brought with them.

The building where we went was a commando, how you say, a building for the pilots, the officer, pilots, officers. You can imagine how many toilets they have. Everything was full of money, full of gold. From there, the Germans, they took everything what we had and they used to beat us if they don\u2019t give whatever they had. After the, like I say, they put us in -- they gave the alarm and we start to walk to the port, you know, to the -- to take the boat. Like that they took us to Pireo, took three days or five days to take to Pireo. You can imagine, was the, the 23 of July; we arrived the August 16. The 12\" was from Rhodes to Athens; from Athens to Auschwitz, the 23\" and we arrived the 16\" in Auschwitz. To Haidari was in July 234. "

That building was the headquarter of the pilots, the officer, the aviation. I should do that before. Then the men they went there for three days. After three days, they start to ask all the women and the children, they should come too and to bring all the possession they had, the silver, the money, the gold to bring in together. Then they would stay all day long there, they would stay long in -- they would be in one building, in one village. Your money, you will support yourselves. I should start like this.

He used to read continuously, continuously, continuously until we arrived. My mother, she was sitting there. We didn\u2019t have room to move. We didn\u2019t have no toilets. We didn\u2019t have nothing. My brothers, my sister, my brother-in-law, even we want to make our necessity and we say, turn your face. In the same train, in the same people, in the same where we were sitting because they didn\u2019t have no room. My three nephews, my sister-in-law, she was very young, twenty-five years old. Her little girl was a year and a half. My brother at that time was 28 years, I don\u2019t know. My father was 71, my mother 60, 61 when they arrive in Auschwitz. They promise us we will see every night. During the day, they will go to work. But was not like that. Only we heard by the French when we smell the meat, barbecue. They used to look like they have steak in the -- steak barbecue. We say, look they eating barbecue with the music and the French people what was over there before us, they say no. They are your parents, they are cremated. At that time, we didn\u2019t know what mean cremated. Because in our country, in our little island, we was very naive. We knew what means cremation because in our Bible they say cremated, cremation is against the law We never thought they 13 would cremated those people. My brother, they took my brothers and my brother- in-law, they choose to work and also myself. But my brother Josef went to Mauthausen, Nissim was in Dachau, my brother-in-law was in Rideltow and those things I find out because I wrote to Red Cross. They answered me and they told me where they was dead. That is the reason I know where I lost my brothers. Myself, I was working in Villestadt before for two months, years. I was working in Auschwitz bringing barrels of food to the kitchen or bring water to the kitchen. After breaks, after they send us to Villestadt. Was factory of munition. My job was gleeov. I can\u2019t translate what mean gleeov. The only thing I know was a big trunk. I put pieces of metal. The machine gun I don\u2019t know. Put it there and then put it in the \u2014 in one place, 500 mil kilowatt to make hard. Every 20 minute, I have to change the trunk and put the other. In the meantime, the 20 minute until they would be cool off. I used to help the other girls who they couldn\u2019t make it. We worked 12 hours daily for one week. One night, 12 hours. Tachi and Nachi they used to call. But we never saw when was daytime. When was nighttime because we was working under tunnel. We never saw sunshine. We never saw the time, what time, what day. We didn\u2019t know nothing. We was working like slave until the Russian they start to come and they move us in other place to work in pieces of assembly of airplane. We stayed there three, four days or one week. From there they took us another place. They put in the wagons, almost the end I think. They left us in wagons, closed of Villestadt, no Theresienstadt. They closed the wagons for five days. How many girls was dead and we didn\u2019t have no toilet, no air, only they was lucky with chan. After five days over there, you should see the cholera they have, the cholera. The Russian camp, they liberated us. They say to us, \u201ckein arbeit, kein brot\u2019; if you don\u2019t work for you, you can\u2019t have bread. The strong girls, they have to go to work. You have to go. To me, they pick up myself to work in -- to make bread. Another also to make bread. The other in the kitchen to cook so we worked just for us. Some afternoon, we used to go to the Russian commander to clean the rooms and to cook for them. Every time when I used to go there, I used to steal one knife, knife, one fork and one time I stole a little cushion. Until they sent us to Prague. From Prague I escaped twice. I went to Budapest to ask help for my friends who was very sick with this dysentery. We started all over."

In the meantime, I didn\u2019t have no money. I brought with me $500 but was easy to spend. I wrote to Italy. I say when I will work, I will pay you. They send me every month $100. Like that. I can pay $40 and the $60 I can eat and take the carfare. I had more hard time in United States than in Germany. Because in Germany I know I was obligated, with no choice. But over here, I couldn\u2019t speak the language, I couldn\u2019t find job and I didn\u2019t have no place to stay. I had very bad life. For one year I was desperate until I decide to go back to Italy. I say I wish to find a job to make my ticket and to go back. A friend of mine, my cousin who I saved from Auschwitz, who got diarrhea, she say come to Seattle and I will find job for you. I went to Seattle; I start to work but I had hard time because I didn\u2019t know the language. I was working in but very hard to explain to me. I took time from the other people to teach me, to tell me what to do and my time also. They fire me. Finally I look in the telephone book, Italian family, Italian place and I find Euro- city store and I start to work in Euro-city store. After five years, I became American citizen. I say, goodbye everyone. I\u2019m going to Europe to see where will be my destiny. I was going to Israel and in Israel they have war after war. I say not forme. When I went to Italy, I find out the life was very hard to find job. I say, I will come back to United States. I will work more. When I will have more money, I\u2019ll go back to Israel. That is what I did. Now in the meantime, my health is no good. My health is very deteriorated."
