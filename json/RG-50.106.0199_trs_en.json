When I was born he was in Klagenfurt working as a window dresser for the only department store in town. My mother had been sent to be a, to learn how to become a master milliner and she was an apprentice for I believe seven years. They had the guild system in Austria and she was a master milliner. And as a result she had a store where she made hats and had four apprentices working for her. Meanwhile, they lived in a flat. We lived on the second story and they always had every year, a different girl, peasant girl would come from Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, some such place, for a one year contract and up, upstairs, there was another family and Herbert was a little boy who played with me. He was a year younger than me and if https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Erica Laufer 5 August 19, 2012 we wanted to play we would push the broom on the ceiling or the floor as to whether or not we wanted to play."

It had a very nice yard that we could use to our heart\u2019s content. And I don\u2019t know goose, by the name of Pauline. And we would sit on a bench. It was very pleasant.

I remember being taught by nuns. I have no idea whether the public schools in Klagenfurt were run by nuns or whether that was a Catholic school. My mother liked to deny her Jewishness and tried to tell me that her parents, her mother Julie Hotzel was Catholic. But I\u2019m not too sure about that. I sort of doubt it. But anyhow, I went to school and I was the only Jewish child there. My father insisted that I not attend class during Catholic training. As a result I recall spending my time out in the school yard, even in the fall and the winter for the hour that they had the daily religious training. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Erica Laufer 6 August 19, 2012 The nuns didn\u2019t like me and they thought that I was slow witted and insisted that I be trained to learn how to read and how to do math. I was very slow and I seem to recall sitting in front of the room in disgrace all the time."

I would run after him because he walked so fast and my grandfather, my mother\u2019s father, Otto Schwartz would pick me up after school.

Then they would take me to the little shop that they had. It was no larger than this room here. And they had imported fabrics, beautiful fabrics https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Erica Laufer 8 August 19, 2012 from Scotland or what not.

And I recall one of my friends in class, Herta, she kept raising her hand cause she wanted to go to the bathroom and the teacher thought she was saying Heil Hitler too much and wouldn\u2019t let her go.

There was this man with a funny hairdo and funny moustache and a uniform https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Erica Laufer 9 August 19, 2012 and he was screaming and shouting and everybody was Heil Hitler-ing. The next day or the same day, almost immediately, Herbert came to see me and said his mother said we could no longer play together. He was forbidden to talk to me. The school told me, I could no longer go to school there. Dr. Strife the pediatrician said he could no longer treat us. And then a short while after that, an edict came that everybody who was Jewish had to resume or acquire a Jewish or Hebrew name and wear a yellow star. And everyone had to leave and move to the first section, Asta Bitzerk [ph] of Vienna. Find relatives or anything to go there and so we moved into the small flat of my father\u2019s father, Shmeil Laufer was his name. I think he went by Samuel. But his name was Shmeil. His wife had died a number of years earlier, Esther. She had died earlier. And everybody descended on this little apartment. It was on one of the upper floors. Flats they called them in those days."

So that was very successful. Several years earlier she had fired Dora Taya [ph], one of her apprentices because https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Erica Laufer 11 August 19, 2012 she was stealing from customers and from the store. And after Anschluss Dora Taya came with an SS officer and said for my mother to get out. This now belongs to Dora Taya. No, don\u2019t take anything with you. Just go. My mother\u2019s brother, Richard Schwartz, meanwhile had married a very beautiful Catholic girl by the name of Annie. Very stylish, very beautiful, very tall. She advised him to take all the money out of the bank. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen and they put it in, they put it in a paper bag and she said she accidentally threw it in the trash. They spent two days at the city dump looking for the money. Of course they never found her and of course she was seen next with an SS officer as well. I don\u2019t know what happened to Richard or my grandparents at that point, my mother\u2019s family. Until later. I never saw, I know I never saw them again.

And the SA were like scouts, first. They marched also with them and they were of course, being young boys, were the most vicious. They came upstairs one day and they were looking for things. Unfortunately nobody had anything but they threw some furniture out the window. But then they left. I recall one of them actually looked at me and smiled. I was a little kid, eight years old.

It, just a recollection of total fright and terror. After a while the relatives said they couldn\u2019t afford to have us come there anymore of course."

            "answer": "His father and all his relatives as to how could we go someplace where it\u2019s so strange and different and we don\u2019t know the language and the custom and they got slanted eyes and yellow skin and nobody can understand anything they say, even when they speak German, which 1s true. You can\u2019t understand them when they speak English and they\u2019re speaking English. But anyhow, they made complete fun of him and they said these classic words that he\u2019s being very foolish that god will take care of him. they have lived good lives and god will, good God fearing lives and they, God will, God will take care of them in the form of England and the United States. America and England would not let anything happen to them. Ok. They laughed at him and said he was foolish and had no skill, no ability. What would he do? And he said well his wife makes hats. And we would figure it out. Ok. One of his sisters apparently had a new husband who had more energy than the other people there and she had a daughter or maybe it was his daughter. I believe it was her daughter. And he said they were moving to Sweden and they laughed at him too. What would he do? And he said he was going to make soap. And I remember they laughed at him. they had to hold their mouths so they wouldn\u2019t make so much noise. They were laughing. So everybody already has soap. Why would they need you to make soap? And what do you know about making soap. Anyhow, there was a big kettle. And he proceeded to make soap. He did make soap. Understand they did move to Sweden and I understand that the daughter became a nurse. I don\u2019t\u2019 know her name. I don\u2019t know their married name. I have no idea. I don\u2019t know his name, his father\u2019s name. Anyhow, my father also had a sister whose name was also Clara and she had, she was I believe divorced or widowed. I think divorced or whatever. Anyhow she did have a husband. Her daughter, Vera, was my favorite cousin. And they of course had no money to go anywhere. So we were going to leave and go to China. My father went to some kind of a building. I don\u2019t know whether it was a court, or whether it was a government exit visa. I don\u2019t\u2019? know what it was. Anyhow, we went there and when he got there it had been occupied and there was a commandant sitting there. And there was blood on the wall and he could hear men screaming. And it was my https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Erica Laufer 15 August 19, 2012 father\u2019s turn and he said he went up and said Herr commandant I am a veteran of World War I. I fought on behalf of the Austria-Hungarian Empire. I am a poor man. I am a window dresser without any skills. I have tickets to China. If you have seen the movie, Good Earth you know that they are so poor that they are even eating earth. Undoubtedly we will be killed there or starve to death or they will kill us or we will die as a result of the civil war they\u2019re in. You don\u2019t need us and there\u2019s only me and my wife and my daughter. My small daughter. And we will, have tickets to leave within two weeks. And the man said, let him go. As far as I know, he was the only person who ever talked his way out of a concentration camp. It\u2019s been my inspiration all my life. Speak up. Ok. Speak up and have something worthy to say. As he went out, a man approached him and said do you want tickets to Port of Spain. My father said what\u2019s that. He said it\u2019s a British crown colony in the Caribbean and my father said , he asked what\u2019s that and the man told him it\u2019s a small island opposite Venezuela that\u2019s owned by the British. And that he had gotten tickets where he wanted to go, namely where everybody wanted to go, Argentina. And did my father want his tickets to Trinidad. Of course my father took it. I don\u2019t know whether he paid or had the money or whether it was all free in those days. You could only take a hundred marks, shillings, whatever they had, out of the country. So it didn\u2019t make any money, difference how much money you had or what you spend. Anyhow, I remember he came back and said we\u2019re going to Trinidad. And he offered his tickets to China to the other relatives who just laughed. I don\u2019t know if eventually they used them or what. I have no idea. I have no recollection or knowledge of what happened to the relatives after that. Other than Clara. Anyhow, we went to, we had to go to Amsterdam. I believe we had 67 relatives when we left. And we went by train to Amsterdam where we would wait until the ship, the Cotica would come and take us on to Trinidad."

And my father was horrified because my father was the most honest person you\u2019ve ever met. Even to people who wanted to kill you, exterminate you, he was going to obey what they said. He would never have done anything like that. He was shocked. Anyhow the man said he had emptied his suitcase and he had fixed it so that he had lots of money in there and jewelry or whatever it is. And my father said the only jewelry we have we\u2019re wearing. There was, I had a little locket. And my mother had a couple of bracelets and my father had a watch or something. And I think maybe two gold chains. They were in plain sight. We were wearing them. Anyhow, when we came to the station, the SS agent came and took the man away.

And his wife was obviously very British with blond hair and blue eyes. They had about 12 different children. No two of them had the same shape, size or color. I had never heard of adoption. I don\u2019t know if they were adopted or whether this happens through having enough children with a mixed race, whatever. The youngest ones were pale blond. The oldest ones were much darker, that\u2019s all I know. Anyhow we stayed with them for a month. That\u2019s what had been arranged. And then there was carnival or something. I think carnival is in February actually. I don\u2019t know why. But anyhow there was carnival in Trinidad where they go singing through the streets and marching and dressed in costume. And singing Mardi Gras and what not and so on. They\u2019d do nothing except sing and dance through the streets. And I ran afoul of the color line which we knew nothing about because often in Austria, we had never seen anyone. Oh we once had gone to, we once had gone to Vienna and saw a gypsy with a baby. She was nursing a baby in the middle of the street, very shocking. Other than that we never saw anybody expect a white person. And in Trinidad there was a -- which we didn\u2019t know there was a color line and we had no costume so my mother had, I had dirnd1 skirt and an apron. And my mother put a kerchief on my head upside down, mammy style. And apparently I crossed the color line and caused a sensation because a white person doesn\u2019t dress like a black person. Anyhow, I don\u2019t know how it happened but my mother immediately got a job in a hat store, making hats. My mother\u2019s a very nervous woman.

And she went to the bathroom at work, put the purse down on the sink while she was washing her hands and a black man came in and stole her purse. She of course could not identify him because not having been there long enough, every black looked like every other black. When you first see Chinese or you think they all look the same after a while you see everybody\u2019s different. Anyhow all she could say he was black. Of course he was never found. We now had no money, no jewelry which they had hoped to be able to sell. Anyhow, my mother worked and she hated black people. All the rest of her life detested them with a passion. Thought they were all ignorant stupid and black. (laughs) And they were no better than a gorilla. She absolutely detested them. They later had more reason to hate them. But anyhow, she was working there. And in the evening she would, she cut apart our curtains and made I think maybe a dozen or less little children\u2019s dresses, little fluffy children\u2019s dresses. And my father was -- nobody would hire him. There was nothing he could do. They found a little hole in the wall and selling children\u2019s dresses which my mother had sewed after working all day and they were an instant success. They were very fluffy and ruffle-y and what not and they were a tremendous success. And as a result this got around and wholesalers came to see him and gave him credit so that he was able to start a nice little business selling children\u2019s dresses. And he even put an ad in the newspaper saying delicious little children\u2019s dresses which he sent to my mother\u2019s relatives in New York. Because we were hoping to get a visa to go to New York. My mother could have gone instantly since she was on a German passport. There was an endless ability of any German to enter at any time. But my father since his place had become Poland was on a Polish visa and there weren\u2019t that many Poles in United States at that time and he had to wait until his visa would come up. And he showed, he sent this to show what they were doing in Trinidad. And they never lived down the \u2014 my aunt\u2019s husband Alex Cramer. They never stopped giggling and laughing about delicious children\u2019s dresses. My mother meanwhile opened up her owns store, naturally and was very successful because she created hats of a kind that they hadn\u2019t seen before. And they were doing very, very well. And then it became time for England to enter World War II, at which point it was said that it\u2019s a crown colony, an oil colony and so they clapped every last refugee into a detention center with https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Erica Laufer 23 August 19, 2012 barbed wire all around it.

They were countless people from India. I don\u2019t recall the women but I remember the men. They were so many of them. They had turbans and were wearing some kind of diaper. And would be sitting on the public steps, all day long. I don\u2019t know why but they would just sit there, old men sitting in their turbans and sitting on all the public steps. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Erica Laufer 24 August 19, 2012"

Within the first month of our arriving there. Because he undid his over, over those wooden crates that you have. He over -- he opened up the crates and he took out a saw, hammer and nails and he sawed apart one of them to make a table and two benches of the crates. So we instantly had furniture. It was very interesting. There were coconut trees and the houses were, had metal roof, corrugated metal roofs and when it rained, it had monsoons there, rainy season. The coconuts would fall on the roof and went bong, bong, bong, bong. And opposite us there was some guy who had, some man some Indian man who wore just his diaper and a turban and had a goat. And the goat would be there all day long on a chain and say (bleats). I would carry on conversations with the goat. That\u2019s all I remember of that. I don\u2019t remember any children there whatsoever. By the time we were in the detention center there were I think five children. They had duties.

Everybody would go home from work and eat and sleep and the refugees were, just continued to work and walk around in the heat of the sun.

I don\u2019t know what they did in the detention camp because after a while I would just stay in the school and on weekends since I hated having to go to the Anglican church. They went to the Anglican church and I had never been to church before and I was, you had to kneel down at certain times. And Mrs. Lake\u2019s daughters, the oldest ones were in the choir. And I was https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Erica Laufer 26 August 19, 2012 certain that if I kneeled down or attended church any minute God would come and lightning would strike me dead. And as I discovered he didn\u2019t. I was terrified at the boarding school because we had to sing a certain prayer. Oh there were mosquitoes. So you had the mosquito net and you had to say a prayer at night time before you went to sleep. Something about if I should die before I wake I hope the Lord my soul would take. Something, angels at my head and feet. I was terrified to go to sleep. I didn\u2019t want to see these damn angels and I sure didn\u2019t want to see god taking my soul while I was sleeping. Meanwhile Valerie, Mrs. Lake\u2019s daughter, the little monster, would have her fun. I couldn\u2019t speak English you see. And in the dead of night, we shared the room. In the dead of night she would get up every once in a while. Out of her mosquito net, come over to my bed while I was actually sleeping. See I did sleep and whack me one. And I would scream. I mean I had gone through a lot. All I need was something like that. I would scream. And Nanny would come in and she would say that I was had, Valerie would say I had done this to her. That Valerie was sleeping and I had done this. And I couldn\u2019t defend myself. I couldn\u2019t speak English. So I had great incentive every single day we had lessons and I would go after I had studied the lesson, you go to school all day and then you have to learn your homework and then I had to go see Mrs. Lake every day and recite my homework. And I complained to her. I didn\u2019t know what these words meant. I can\u2019t memorize this. I can\u2019t understand this. Sail-y, gaily be night a Gallic night and sunshine are in shadow when riding along, singing a song. In short what does it mean. And she said you don\u2019t have to know what something means to learn. Just repeat it often enough you can learn anything. When you are old enough you will know what it means. Unfortunately I\u2019m now 82 years old. Ok. Anyhow I owe Mrs. Lake a great deal. I learned a huge number of things. I learned how to memorize. I learned how to do mathematics, English and everything else. British history. You name it. French. It was an excellent school. Every single day we had lunch and they would serve these tropical foods I\u2019d never seen before. Fried bananas. Breadfruit. These horrible things as far as I was concerned. Secondly you have to eat it at lunch time, whereas we were used to having a small lunch and a big dinner. They had these huge lunches after which they took a nap and then ate hardly anything at all in the evening. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Erica Laufer 27 August 19, 2012 I would spend all night long starving to death, crying to myself being so hungry. But at lunch time when they served these foods I would make horrified faces and Mrs. Lake would send me out of the room. I had to stand outside where I could see the children so I\u2019d stand outside. And I wouldn\u2019t\u2019 get to eat anything the next meal that was served. I had the same food. I had to learn to eat it without making a face, without dawdling, eating as rapidly as everybody else. And I learned to eat any garbage you put in front of me without making a face."

Something for some reason they stopped doing. But anyhow in those days you needed that. And aunt Irene, her husband, uncle Alex, worked in New York. He checked music to see if that sound was copyrighted. And they sponsored us. And she had never worked. And they sponsored us and she said they could only sponsor a limited number of people depending on how much money they make, Alex made. And made my parents sign a contract that they would never ask for one penny from them. Regardless of what they promised the United States. I sort of never forgave aunt Irene for that but that\u2019s a different story. But they had gotten us a one month rent in a brownstone in Manhattan. It was a huge efficiency and my father pulled out the dictionary, encyclopedia, whatever it was. It was orange covered and it showed the flags of all the different countries and what not. And he pulled up the United States and he found out that Washington, DC is the capital and that not too far from New York and it didn\u2019t cost that much by Greyhound to go from New York to Washington. And he, and it was a small town and since it was the government, they all would be needing hats because of the ladies would be attending functions and would need to wear a hat. And so it would be a good place for my mother to be a milliner. And they decided to we would move at the end of the month to Washington, DC."

Somehow we had one month, every place we went to we had one month. When we got to Washington, DC we had one month, it must have been through the refugee committee I guess. I don\u2019t know. We were staying with a rabbi and his family in northeast Washington. And it was just so different again, so very confusing."

Yes, we were just there for a month. And when we had this one month, I think in DC with the rabbi and looked around. And it was obviously to my parents not the right neighborhood in which people would be wanting to buy designer hats, made to order. And discovered a place in Georgetown, which at that time was a slum where they rented a building at 1330 Wisconsin Avenue, northwest. That there was a store downstairs and there was a little efficiency upstairs. My parents stayed upstairs and the store had, in the back of the store there was a little room which, my mother\u2019s workroom and it had a cot and that\u2019s where I would sleep at night time. That was my place. They were upstairs, I was downstairs. There was a small refrigerator, an antique one, with a gas refrigerator with a motor on top of it. And one day apparently the gas, my mother was always very, she couldn\u2019t do anything. Oh, her husband had to do everything. Everything was such a crisis. Couldn\u2019t do anything at all. One day the gas leaked and this person who could never do anything, somehow called the authorities, had them remove the thing and got a new refrigerator. By the time my father came home, we had a new refrigerator.

And we all shared the same playground. And the bad girls learned how to can and cook and iron. And I know we went over there too. We learned how to, this was during World War II and we learned how to, we were taught how to iron your husband\u2019s shirt. And how to sew and how to darn socks and how to cook Spam and string beans and potatoes and foods, very cheap foods and so on. So that we could manage on your husband\u2019s income."

If there really was an air raid and a bomb dropped on us, we\u2019d be buried alive. And the teacher gave me the same reply that people always give to this kind of question apparently. Just keep quiet and keep singing. I\u2019ve heard this so often in my life. I would ask a question so basic and always got that type of response. So all life has been a learning thing. I was picked on mercilessly. They called me the little Hitler. Because I was German. And of course the only one in the school and of course the only Jewish person within miles around. As far as I know. And I was not ever going to tell anybody that I was Jewish again. I had enough in Austria where It was out there when they were in a nice warm classroom and I had to be outside all by myself in the snow and what not so I wouldn\u2019t have my brain filled up with Catholicism or whatever. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Erica Laufer 36 August 19, 2012 So I said nothing. I was picked on mercilessly. They played games like dodge and it finally occurred to me that they really wanted to hit me as hard as possible. So I would refuse to play and remembered what I had done in Trinidad and I would sit during recess and I would sit and read. You won\u2019t believe this at ten years old, ten and a half, I would read Plato and all the classics. The others could barely read. They were American students and the education system was ridiculous. My parents of course were terrified of authorities. Wouldn\u2019t dream of saying no, that\u2019s not right. The teachers felt I needed to learn now to adjust to learn American history. I could have learned it by reading a book in one weekend. But no, they insisted that I go in class according to my age, instead of according to my knowledge which is far superior having gone to a boarding school. They were learning adding and subtracting and I was doing algebra. Doing math in my head and what not. Doing compositions. Anyhow I sat in the back of the room for two years. Teacher said I could join in any time I wanted to for whatever I wanted to do and spent my time painting pictures the whole time, two years."

I was on the swimming team and we had swimming thing against whatever the major schools in northeast and they disabled me almost instantly by kicking me in the stomach after we dived in. But anyhow, I was on this -- I went to the playground. We never had anybody watching me after we came to the United States. I spent all my time after school. I would go to the library and read books every single day until it was time to come home and eat dinner. And in the summer I would go to the playground. Georgetown playground was just a few blocks away and did crafts and what not. And fended off boys who kept saying annoying things to me. No longer picking on me.

            "answer": "Yeah, since she had this stomach condition and needed medicine and kept ranting and railing that American doctors are far behind, she would send to her relatives in Switzerland soap and perfumes and candies and what not. And they would instead send this to Austria or Germany or France or wherever they had relatives for sedrabal, which was some kind of a stomach thing. I think she lacked sufficient stomach acid or something and this would cure her. They had nothing comparable in the United States. I haven\u2019t been able to find it on the internet. It\u2019s long since gone whatever it was. My mother\u2019s brother meanwhile, when we were you know I said I had never seen when we left Klagenfurt, I had never seen my very beloved grandparents again, my mother\u2019s parents. The Schwartzes. Apparently uncle Richard, my mother\u2019s brother, took them, they \u2014 I know he was in Italy and that went. I know that they were in several countries and eventually he took them to France. From there they were, after World War ended, the Red Cross informed my parents that her parents had died in Buchenwald concentration camp. Apparently the French sent them to their death in Buchenwald. My uncle somehow, remember he was the one that the nuns had said when he was a kid that he would end up on the gallows. But because he always found some way out, that wasn\u2019t a standard one. Anyhow, he wound up in the French Foreign Legion and spent World War II in North Africa with the French Foreign Legion. He eventually, he went back to Austria after, after the war. And he eventually came to the United States."

            "answer": "Yeah, oh I was on the swim team and I had a good friend by the name of Audrey. Very, very pretty girl who was also a very, very good swimmer. And I remember being shocked going to see her in their apartment as to how many people there were who slept all in one bed. And how little they had. Anyhow, next thing you know it was World War II and sailors would come home on the weekend and you couldn\u2019t go downtown to the movie houses without the sailors were and soldiers were lined up on the street like four deep, trying to pick up any girl that walked by, screaming after them. Anyhow, next thing you know little Audrey was pregnant. And she asked me whether I knew where babies came from and I said of course. I had no idea. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Erica Laufer 39 August 19, 2012 No idea whatsoever. I foolishly went home and asked my mother. And she went why do you want to know. And I said well Audrey says she\u2019s going to have a baby. I thought my mother was going to throw up on the floor. She was so shocked. Within I think a month or weeks, she had found a house to buy in Petworth, a row house, all the way across town. I remember my father being stunned. How would you have money for a down payment on a house? And she had done that. My father had never gone to a grocery store and she had. He would -- she worked and she gave him all her money and he would take care of it as was the ancient method. And he would give her grocery money and she would skimp off the grocery money to such an extent that she had enough for a down payment on a house. And he wanted to know how would they pay for this every single month and she said they would rent out the apartment they were living in now and she had her store. And he had an income by now too. And they would be able to do, and they would rent one or two rooms in the house. I could sleep on the sofa. And they would rent enough where they would pay for the utilities and the mortgage. She had read a book that\u2019s called How To Make a Million Dollars in Your Spare Time in Real Estate. And she took that as a recipe and followed every last word of it. Toward the end they owned six houses. She could never get my father to do that because every penny he had, by that time he had a uniform shop. And every penny he had he stuck into the uniform shop. I would work there on Saturdays. He would go on shopping trips for his store to Philadelphia or New York. Mostly Philadelphia and would take me along and I would try on the uniforms and see which were comfortable and which ones didn\u2019t wrinkle and which ones looked very stylish and as a result he had very stylish uniforms. And the wholesalers made a lot of money telling people which uniforms had been proven to be the most comfortable and the most stylish. They were selling them all over the place."

And so they all had to have a uniform. So he had a shop in a black neighborhood on seventh street and (sigh) which had uniforms, ladies uniforms. And then he also took in for pretty white fluffy blouses and then he took in white stockings and then dressy stockings for holidays and so on. And I would go there on Saturdays and help him."

They looked like they were ten or eleven with boyfriends who would buy them fancy stockings and the girls would act so thankful to the boys. And the boys were so nonchalant. I became so disgusted with the whole thing. I hated it. The moment I was 15 I got a underage permit and I got a, I was able to get a job at a department store as a sales lady. For the summer. I didn\u2019t tell them that I was going to go back to school. They just assumed I was one of the many girls who stopped working, I mean stopped going to school and was working. And so I got a job, at a very nice department store. And two months later my parents insisted that they were going on vacation. A friend of theirs, a man who had a shop across the street. His brother had a place up in Akwar, New York in the Poconos and insisted I go with them for a week because the man had a son by the name of Harold that they wanted me to meet. And of course I hated him at first sight. And when I came back after the week up in the mountains, Lansburgh\u2019s said that they didn\u2019t need me anymore that my job was gone. So I got a job at a five and ten a block or so further down. Kresge\u2019s five and ten. And I was in the basement. They put me to selling, counting a hundred marbles and putting them in a sack. A hundred marbles to the bag, all day long. And I, there was a curtain there between this and the store and I would sit as far in the curtain as I possibly could because there was a black man who worked the stock room. He was big and I was terrified of him. I had never been this close to a black man before. I was terrified of him. Anyhow \u2014"

By that time he had moved up to 14\" street to a better neighborhood, so called for a while. And I wanted no part of selling and I wanted to go to New York school of fashion designing. And my mother said over her dead body would I leave the house until I was married. So my father said that he had been supporting his family at a much younger age. He saw no reason why they should support me. But anyhow they finally decided they would give me one year of any education that would then make me financially independent and I could then do whatever it is I wanted to do with my whatever. One of the problems was in high school 1n those days people were very insecure. We all were sure we were going to die as a result of an atomic bomb from the Russians. And everybody got https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Erica Laufer 43 August 19, 2012 married. It seemed everybody was engaged, including me in high school, ready to get married the day they got out of high school. And we decided on McLafin school for medical and legal secretaries. One year of learning how shorthand, typing, blood tests, urinalyses, biothermies, all the systems of the human body, et cetera. Very, very intense for one year. Upstairs, two rooms. And I learned how to take blood give blood, do all these things. Look at microscopes, count how many blood cells there are et cetera. And then after I graduated I got a job. They gave me a job for the summer for some physician, Dr. Goldstein. While his nurse was in England on a three months honeymoon. And I worked there and learned I would never again work for a physician in my entire life, that they\u2019re total phonies and what not. Anyhow I then got a job with the American Trucking Association which was a lobby for the trucking industry in the legal department. And the men would come in at 10:00 with their hats on, sit down at their desk, smoke a cigarette and read the paper and send me out to get coffee and have me doing typing and shorthand and what not. And I soon realized that I could do what they were doing a lot better than what I was doing. And saved my money. Needed all the money I could. I had to work for two years to pay for dental work. I had never had dental work, shoes, feet and what not. I had all kinds of disabilities that nobody had enough money for. And after that decided I would, I didn\u2019t know I had the brains for it, but I decided to I went to George Washington University and they said I didn\u2019t have the requirements to get to college. I had decided in high school to enjoy myself. And not take geometry. I dropped geometry and algebra two and physics, what not. And enjoyed myself in high school, instead of studying. Cause I thought I was going to marry Ralph as soon as I got out, but instead broke up with him. But anyhow, as a result I didn\u2019t have the requirements. They told me I could go as a non-degree student and if I got good grades, when I was 21, I could petition that my grades be counted and miraculously I got all A\u2019s. I went all the way through college and got all A\u2019s and one D. The D was in sociology, criminology and sociology of the criminal. I just wanted to throw them all in jail and throw the key away instead of mollycoddling them. But anyhow, all the rest of them I got A\u2019s and I became Phi Beta Kappa which was an honorary society. I requested a scholarship the last year. I was working during the day and going to night school or other years when I had enough money going to day school and I mean I would go to school during the day or at night, depending on which I had money for. And one year, the last https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Erica Laufer 44 August 19, 2012 year I won the scholarship and they told me my father made enough money to send me through college. And I said my father refuses to send me to college. He believes that women have no business being in college. They should be married and having children. And that if I got an education I would limit my choice of how many husbands, for a husband and he was adamantly opposed to it. They didn\u2019t care about that. But the head of the political science department said if I would switch my major to political science, they needed a secretary. I could work there three afternoons a week and I would, they gave me a scholarship of 150 dollars which in those days was something. And between that and working for him in the school I was able to pay for my last year of college. And then I was working as a secretary, got good wages, I finished and I thought gee I got all A\u2019s and what not. I tried to get a job and I was, couldn\u2019t find a job. The only job I could get was as a typist for the Congressional Record. A reduction of what I was making as a secretary. By that time I was a cracker jack secretary, legal secretary and I was so shocked that you could get all A\u2019s, show that you had the ambition to work your way, pay for it yourself, and nevertheless couldn\u2019t get a job. I walked across the campus to law school and said I would like to apply to become a lawyer. And the gal there said to fill out this form and she saw my Phi Beta Kappa key and she said it wouldn\u2019t be any problem at any rate. No tests, no anything. Ok so I went to law school and worked as, for lawyers. One year I went to the most outstanding law firm 1n Washington. They had an ad for -- two ads, one for a law clerk and one for a secretary and I applied for a secretary. And they gave me an IQ test and refused to hire me because they said my IQ was as high or higher than the lawyers. And I said so that means I can really help them and they said no, this would be too confusing so I said well how about the job you have a job as a law clerk. Oh no. We don\u2019t hire girls for that. I said well if my IQ 1s so high then I\u2019m going to law school. They said that would confuse everyone. There\u2019s -- absolutely not. So I became a women\u2019s libber very soon."

My mind was blank. I had writer\u2019s cramp. I couldn\u2019t even concentrate. Anyhow within a week of having taken that exam I also took the federal service entrance exam as back up. And I practically passed that barely within two points or something. But was picked up by the veterans administration because, not because my score was high because everybody else had a higher score since they had studied for a year. But because I had worked for a doctor and gone through McLaflin\u2019s medical school, I knew one bone from the other. I knew the blood systems. I knew all this stuff backwards and forwards and they were doing disability and they were rating disability of veterans. And people on social security and old age and so on. So they hired me. And they couldn\u2019t promote me fast enough. They thought I was a genius. I got one promotion after the other. Even bringing, in taking off several weeks to have a baby."

Gail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Erica Laufer. This is track number three. Let\u2019s talk about some of your thoughts and your feelings about what you went through. Do you think about your childhood often now and what you had to go through, leaving your home, going to different places? Do you think about it more often as you\u2019ve gotten older? Erica Laufer: Oh yeah. Because once you\u2019re retired you don\u2019t have as much to do so you have time to think about these things. Otherwise, one keeps oneself so busy, one doesn\u2019t think about anything. Leave alone anything that might be difficult. ve thought about many times. My parents had a chance to go back to Austria and then they did visit. I also was sent something or other and unfortunately, any time I see something German or Austrian, I have mixed feelings. I don\u2019t want to give them a penny of my existence. Other than that I don\u2019t think much of them. I\u2019m grateful that I\u2019m not living there, that they sent me away. They wanted to exterminate me. I don\u2019t have any \u2014 the thing that bothers me endlessly in my brain is something that is politically incorrect. And you can\u2019t ask. The Germans went through people\u2019s history as to how many generations back they had Jewish blood. And if so, they were sent to concentration camps. How are the Germans now that they have their pure Aryan blood? That has been bothering me terribly. When the Moors and Jews were thrown out of Spain, we know what happened to Spain. It went downhill. And why hasn\u2019t this happened to Germany yet? All their intellectuals, all their money people. Everybody who was anything was Jewish. The men all tried to marry a blond girl, as non-Jewish as possible, if they possibly could. What\u2019s happened to those children? Were they all sent to concentration camps? Did they wind up in Argentina, New York, Israel? https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Erica Laufer 50 August 19, 2012 My father\u2019s sister Clara and her daughter Vera, my favorite cousin, were in concentration camps. They apparently survived and were sent to Israel. In the last days of concentration camp, Vera married a fellow from the concentration camp. However, she became pregnant in Israel and he said he had never had a life. He had had no youth. Had nothing. He didn\u2019t want to be burdened with a wife and children. And that was the last heard from him, I understand. She went insane finally and she habitually would run through the streets stark naked. They would arrest her and put her in a, whatever it is. And my father would send money for, or for some medicine that would temporarily make her sane. I don\u2019t know what happened to them. Eventually they, somebody, maybe it was her mother, grandmother. But her son, the son wanted to go to technical school and they didn\u2019t have money and my father sent money for him to go to technical school. After that my father died in 1975. My mother I think tore up everything she could possibly find, where there were any knowledge of anybody else. She says all they want is money from you. So I have no way of knowing other relatives. Obviously I have some in Israel. I obviously have some in Sweden. Unless they have all gone back to somewhere else. Who knows? Cause I don\u2019t know where Freddie wind up. Men usually die earlier than women, but he may still be around somewhere. But I saw some photograph when I was doing, I was doing a history of the family. And I came across a picture of Freddie and his children and his wife. But that was something in Germany. I don\u2019t know if they were just on vacation or what. I don\u2019t know where these people are. I don\u2019t have any relatives. I didn\u2019t really care. I never thought about them. I agreed with my mother. Forget about them. But my children keep wanting to know do we have relatives, some. My grandchildren. Do we have relatives in some other country? Where are they? Who are they? I don\u2019t know.

And stopped off in German Switzerland. And went to Vienna. We went, I wanted to go to Klagenfurt but it was snowing and there was -- it was six hours by train and the train couldn\u2019t go cause the tracks were full of snow. And we spent, no airplane could leave Vienna airport. And there I had a little overactive son and a daughter at Vienna airport. And we couldn\u2019t go. We were stuck there for days at the airport. And finally I let them run loose and he did what boys do. He https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Erica Laufer 52 August 19, 2012 ran up to the conveyor belt and played with the conveyor belt and within minutes somebody came and said Madame, we do not let our children run loose in \u2014 perhaps in America. And so I took the cue and said oh but I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve been here for so long. What can I possibly do, I can\u2019t control them. Within minutes they found us a plane to get us out of Vienna. I think it was to Egypt. And from there we would go to India. Unfortunately, there seemed to have been some problem on the plane, because we all had to depart, stand in the middle of nowhere and they brought our luggage next to us. And we had to stand next to the luggage. Nothing seemed to happen. The luggage went back on. Everybody got back on the plane. And they said it would be I don\u2019t know, four hours or something before we would leave. Six hours. And so I left Chris with the children and decided to go to the airport and enjoy it. I thought I couldn\u2019t get back on the plane until it was departing. It was hours and hours at the airport. I couldn\u2019t leave outside. No permission to leave and go outside the airport.
