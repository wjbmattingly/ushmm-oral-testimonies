But I have, like Rabbi Schlossberg and other people told me, that I have an obligation to spread the word. Reluctantly I do this. Now I get a satisfaction of speaking to people in the hinterlands of the Midwest. We're not talking about New Yo rk, Washington, Chicago or Detroit, we're talking about where I live where Jews are still seen with horns. That I get a satisfaction out of speaking to schools and tell them not necessarily my life but what the holocaust can do to you. Because many of these kids' parents don't believe the holocaust happened. It's everywhere. When I talk, I remember one school, I talk about the sten gun I had in the Maquis. The kids write me letters afterwards, which are very interesting. None is alike. Because I ask the teacher that the kids write something about the speech. Some of them go, some of them don't. One of them, a kid writes: I like Mr. Marx's talk about guns because I love guns. The kid is 10 years old or 12 years old. We shoot every Sunday and I love to play with guns. Well, my mission wasn't done. I had one experience in one high school, I spoke to 200 juniors and seniors, they were exchange students from Switzerland, Germany and Poland, I think it was. And I told them my message there is different than when I tell you my story. My message is it shouldn't happen ever again, because it can. A young woman from Germany comes to me: I want to show you something. Do you speak Germ an? I said: Yeah, but speak to me in English, this is America. I can speak English. I want to show you something. She opens her purse and shows me the picture of her grandfather in an SS black uniform with all kinds of ribbons. Proudly she showed me this picture. What sh all I do? I had enough how do you say that in English (?kayack?) to walk away, not to get involved with this child. Because later on, when I tell this to people, they say you should have taken the picture and tear it up. That's not the answer, but it did happen. These experiences are still out there that 17, 18yearold young woman is proud to have that picture. She probably doesn't know what that man did. He probably killed a few hundred."

            "question": "How long did you stay in Indianapolis?",
            "answer": "I stayed in Indianapolis until 1959 when I got married. And I worked in that delicatessen and I got fired because I wanted more money. I was tending bar and go to school at night at Indiana University. I didn 't get a degree, but I went to business school. Because a long, long relative, cousin picked me up and made me work for him. His name was Max Reiss. I don't know if you ever hear d that name before. But he's Finer Foods. He died since too. And I worked for him and then I worked for his competitor. I was in the food business. I was in the I was moved to Minneapolis. And there I became parttime cantor on Friday. I was home Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Went back on the road Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursd ay. And that's how I got acquainted with because my background from home, from the seminary , from the school in Paris, and the encouragement of Rabbi Sacks in Minneapolis, who was a lousy chauffeur blower. When I heard that, I says: Give it to me. And I've been blowing the chauff eur ever since. But I became their cantor on Friday, on Shabbat. And there was no money. And then I was moved to Dayton, Ohio where I did my vol untary services for the Wright Patterson Air Force Base on Friday nights and Saturday mornings. I was the divorced from my first wife because I spent too much time on weekends, instead of with the children, with the what she called me, she came from a very informed environmen t, she called me a religious nut. And I shouldn't have done it, we didn't get along any more to call her that. I came to Louisville, Kentucky in 1978 because I wanted to settle down and not travel anymore. There was an opportunity for opening up a gourmet delicatessen food store which I was knowledgeable. And it didn't go over. Rabbi Cling from the congregation _+ said: We need a religious director. What's a religious director? A religious director is a glorified (?shama?). I said: What is my job? He says: Anything that I don't want to do you do it. And I've ever been there ever since."

            "question": "Can we talk a little bit before we end about your feelings and your reflections? You had said that you have this sense of op timism that you probably inherited from your father. What else kept you going through these terrible time s of the war? Anything else besides that?",
            "answer": "Well, one, how can anyone believe six million, five million, four million, one million? Impossible. Okay, so they're put in a camp, don't get much to eat. But killing? It's how can and I was a young punk who loved life. And I don't know, I still do. At the age of 70 I still believe that I'm one of the luckiest people in the world. And this is what I tell the people. What kept me alive is I don't know. But I wanted to stay alive because and I don't want to be a saint or anything, but I hope the next day is better than the one yesterday. And when Rabbi Kurshner says ba d things happen to go od people look, I'm not good people, bad things happen anyway . Bad things can happen to anyone and not everybody is good. It's easy to say bad things happen to six million. They were all good people. And like you asked me awhile ago, my father had a big influence on me despite I only knew him for a few years. And my love for him, I don't know. Children ask me, and this is what I say at the end: Why do you still believe in God? I keep a kosher home. I'm not what you call an orthodox Jew. I wear a kippah when I go to holocaust museum. I'm not a fanatic. As a child I wore a (?talibkatan?). As a child we wore a very _ from home. The question is why I still believe in God? The answer is why not? And that's me."

            "answer": "Oh, I was told that I get very emotional at the time of Yom HaShoah. I found out that other people are in the same boat. That it is amazing there's a scar. We all have scars. And this scar may be healed but it's there. But why did it take 50 years to get a holocaust museum? All of a sudden in 1950 nobody wanted to talk about it. Was America ashamed of it? Maybe they should have, maybe not. I'm not a politician. But America should have done more and they know it. All of a sudden not necessarily all of a sudden, in the last 10 years or so the stories come about. Ther e's a lot of people, myself, who I didn't mention what I saw when we were running from the Germans, that the Messerschmitts up there were shooting at at civilians running away from Paris. We just saw people getting killed and bloody stuff in the on the way to Limoges. You know, it's impossible to explain these things. There are no witnesses to it. There are just those who survived and they didn't want to talk. I know people that we re in the same boat as I am. I met them out in Los Angeles. They didn't wa nt to talk about it. They have a new life. Some of them went to school, some of them became very wealthy. Some of them did well. I don't know if they have done their share to Judaism or not. Because if I win the lottery tomorrow, that's another story. But I think we have now and I realize, and like I said, I'm not a good guy, I'm not a saint. We now have an obliga tion to spread the word. And as a school, I'll tell the teacher is waiting for me over there now in the little county. She she says I'm her she's a very devout Christian: I am the Jewish what do you call it? Preacher."

It's amazing how our Jewish peop le feel that way, when they say: My hometown. Uhuh, I have no hometown. My hometown is where I live now, where I have a wife. That's my hometown. I hear people going back to my ho metown in Castle or wherever they are. That's not a hometown. She never had a home, sh e got chased out of there. We have our own Jewish people buy MercedesBenz of cour se. And to me, I said it one time, I says: I won't go in that Nazi car. And the man was ve ry upset about that, what I said. Let them do what they want. There is I don't want to go to Germany. People went to Germany as guests of the German I wrote for the heck of it. I wrote to the town of Speyer: I am Ernst Marx, son of Leo Marx, later (?Abino?) Marx. And I would I hear that I'm welcome in your city. What when shall I we intend to vi sit you next year. I don't know, it's always in German. Anyway, said: What is your what do you help us out financially? The answer came: My name is not B\u00fcrgermeister, my name is Ober B\u00fcrgermeister _ port. And he says: I am 42 years old, I do not know anything about the past. Our town is not in position to finance your trip. However, you will always be welcome in our city. Oh, achtung _ Very Truly Yours. So I am no, a lot of people ask me do I want to go back. I went to Israel three times. I went to Israel to pick up my mother who was in Israel and had another stroke in Israel. A nd I had to bring her back firs t class on Luf on Lufthansa to Frankfurt. This is the funniest and because El Al didn't have any room. And went back on two trips with the synagogue to Israel as part I was at the upper shem. And I said (foreign language) at the flame down there. I think this was the highlight of my whole life. You know, we have a beautiful museum ri ght over here, which is historical. It's not for us, I think our it's not a museum, a memorial is in Israel. They're building more, I understand. (Tape change)"
