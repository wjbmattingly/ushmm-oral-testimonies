And they blocked off all the intersections, they put barbed wire at every intersection with a guard and a dog, and you could no lee -- you could not leave unless you had a permit, a pass, or if you\u2019re going to work. That\u2019s the only way. And then, of course, it overcrowded -- and then we had, from the outskirts, some Jewish farmers we had, that lived in the little shtetls, outskirts of the city. And if the Germans didn\u2019t know, they took a non-Jew with them, a Gentile on the -- on the Jeep to show them where the Jews lived. And then they rounded them up and they told them to leave. Left the house. Whatever you take with you, they\u2019ll let you take a few suitcases, whatever you want and you had to wound up in this ghetto. And of course, overcrowded. You had to put up people, help to one another. So food was scarce, starting to get scarce, sort of every day less, less, less and less. People were bribing the soldiers, they had something to bribe them with, but then as the thing got around you didn\u2019t have anything to bribe them with any more, everything you had you gave away already. So, you couldn\u2019t even bribe them then. So you -- then there was a lot of suffering going on with -- Interview with Henry Greenbaum \u00b0 December 20, 1999 especially with food and -- and health too, because we had the overcrowding caused the -- the sanitary conditions were very bad and typhus broke out. And when the typhus broke out then they -- they would pick up the people with -- that had fever, took them with trucks away and we no longer saw them any more. They shot them and killed them and buried them somewhere in the outskirts of that city."

We were -- up til then we were in the ghetto and October then came and they came out on the loudspeakers early in the morning, they banged on our doors with the rifles, scared to death, early in the morning, raus, raus, everybody out. Where we going? To the marketplace. Everyone had to leave the area of the ghetto into the marketplace. And we had to wait for the people to come over at night for the night shift, I wa -- I had the night shift from 11 to seven in the morning. When I came Interview with Henry Greenbaum a December 20, 1999 from the factory they did not take us back to the ghetto, we went right to the marketplace. In the marketplace we all had to stand around it until -- from five a.m., I would say about til three in the afternoon, until -- til the selection started. They -- they started picking the -- before that even, people were coming towards the -- from the ghetto towards the marketplace to walk. It was a little distance, I don\u2019t know exactly the amount of the distance, but on the way there they were -- the Germans were screaming loud, schnell, fast, fast. And children would get separated from their mothers, and you could hear the children screaming Mom, they were screaming for their mothers, the children -- and the mothers would scream for the babies, they got lost for a second or so. It caused a lot of turmoil to -- to -- to get all these people lined up in the marketplace. And they finally did line them up with the selection and that guy -- we stayed, and he would say left, right, left, right. And of course, th-the old -- the old ones, the old people and the real young, they would take them right over to one section. They didn\u2019t go right, left, they just take them over, you -- looked at you, you were old, over to the section. If you had children, over to the section. I had one of my sisters with two children. She held onto them, both girls. That was the -- my sister\u2019s named Reisl. She held onto the two children with my mother, they held on, stayed together. My other sister worked at night with me, Faige. We came in the morning, so the child was with my grandmother -- with the Interview with Henry Greenbaum _ December 20, 1999 child\u2019s grandmother, which was my mother. And when the child saw her mother, she was screaming for her, she wanted her mother, but her mother -- she started running over to the mother and the German would start hitting her, kicking [indecipherable] back to the grandmother. He would not let her go over to the sister -- to -- to -- to my sister, which was the child\u2019s mother. And the ch-child was crying. She finally quit crying and my -- my mother, which was the child\u2019s grandmother, held onto her. Until this was lined up and I would say at -- by five o\u2019clock it was -- everything was straightened out. They took the old people and the real young and marched them towards the railroad yard. And the people that they picked, the younger ones, they looked like the ones that had already jobs and the ones that didn\u2019t have jobs, but they looked young, strong, were moving over to one area. And after the old ones marched away from us, then they started on us. They start lining us up again, checking us over again. And on the way when the people left towards the railroad yard we could hear screams going on, we could hear the rifle shootings were going, maybe they shot in the air, I don\u2019t know, but there was a lot of commotion going on until these people were settled towards the railroad yard. And ones then they -- we heard they packed them in and we heard the train, the noise of the locomotive and we knew they were heading away. We didn't know where they were going, we never did know where. They went to us, they lined us up Interview with Henry Greenbaum \u201c\u00b0 December 20, 1999 again and they told us five in a row, and line up, and the Germans were standing there, and -- with the guards and the Ukrainians. They even had the Lithuanians with them, too, who joined the Nazi regime. Those were also no good. Very, very bad. And they lined us up and they told us to march, start marching. And we marched. And you had little satchels with you, they told you to take whatever you want with you, so you gra -- how much did I have? I had a little satchel with me, I don\u2019t even know what was in it. Mother packed it for me, she said you take this with you. So wis -- when we were heading towards the destination where they told us to go to march -- and on the way they kept beating us too, we didn\u2019t walk too fast, then they told us to jog. And it was all uphill. And the place we were heading for was six and a half kilometers from the market. It was hot to -- October, very hot. Usually it\u2019s cool already, but that was a very hot October. We didn\u2019t have anything to drink from five a.m. in the morning [indecipherable] to drink, no water, nothing. And on the way they kept beating us and -- and some people were falling down on the ground. Then they beat them up and they made us lift them up again and walk with them, he-helping them along. We finally did come to the destination and we looked and there was a camp for us. And we were not aware of it in this outskirts of the town that they built -- in fact, there was two camps. They took one bunch over to one sa -- area, to one camp, and one to another, was two camps in that city. And Interview with Henry Greenbaum a December 20, 1999 that was the Arbeitslager, the -- what they call a slave labor camp. They -- they didn\u2019t have any electric wires around us, they had regular barbed wire. But they had the guards on the towers and they had guards below. And barracks. And that was a surprise for us, I suppo -- we didn\u2019t even know what was going on there. They built it secretly. We knew nothing of [indecipherable] of it until we go -- finally got there to the gate and the loudspeaker again out, and he says everybody achtung, achtung whatever their name is and whatever they said, and they said empty your pockets, all that -- what you bring with you, dump into a little box, there\u2019s a box sitting there on the side, and the satchels went into the box. There was another box, they said, take all your jewelry, all money, dump it into this other box. And you\u2019d better aboi -- abide by it because you will get killed. So we all listened, of course you had to do it, otherwise you don\u2019t want to get killed over there, so you search yourself, make sure you don\u2019t have a nickel left. Empty your pocket, you empty it, everything, with the jewelry and threw it in. They pile it [indecipherable] behind the gate of the camp, and assigned us to different barracks. We came into the barracks and all they had was empty bunks. Was nothing over there, just wood. They put us three to a bunk. It was, I think, three or four bunks high. And --and they had nothing, no water, not a thing for us, just shoved us into those barracks. And we didn\u2019t get out from those barracks until five a.m. in the morning the following Interview with Henry Greenbaum \u201c December 20, 1999 morning. The -- the -- the loudspeaker again, aus, everybody aus, aus, aus, aus. And then they would give us the [indecipherable]. The ones who had jobs working in the ammunition factory, line up to one area. So we all knew where, you know, we were already [indecipherable] so we stood in one area, then he filled in others with us, then they marched us towards the factory. As we came into the factory, we were- they\u2019re like a -- a -- a herd of cows. We were walking in and they were stand with the long whips and they\u2019re beating on us [indecipherable]. And the overseer with the SS man was right there with him. With the dogs barking and screaming, grabbing your legs if you didn\u2019t walk fast enough, or your clothes. And I remember there was this shouting shout [indecipherable] we didn\u2019t walk fast enough to the gate. And that was a regular ritual with them, in the morning to go 1n we gota beating and then when we left we got a beating. Either way we didn\u2019t walk fast enough [indecipherable] a good excuse, because we were all bunched up in one area, trying to get through the gate so that we can go about -- to march back to the camp, and we\u2019d always get beatings over there. And then, you know, once we got up to the -- inside the factory compound, we all knew where our stations were. And the new ones were assigned to the areas wherever they assigned them to. And we stayed there in that factory til almost -- I would say til 1943, or -- or the beginning of \u00b044, we stayed in that Arbeitslager. And there too, typhus broke out. Very bad Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Henry Greenbaum \u201d December 20, 1999 typhus, I had it myself. And I lost a sister that way. One of my sisters, Chaja, they drove in a truck one morning before I came back from work, the night shift. And seven o\u2019clock instead of letting us into the -- to the camp, they would let us in between the barbed wire, like six feet apart or something like that. And all of us had to stay in the barbed wire til the two truckloads came out of the camp. And these were supposedly going all infected people with the typhus. And we no longer saw them after that. That\u2019s -- I lost one sister right there. Of course, the others, in the beginning when we had -- when the -- what do you call it, the -- when they took everybody, the old and the young away, in the beginning I lost a sister there, too, in another town. But that\u2019s how I lost one of them. The other sister, my t -- the -- the one that was two years older than I was, she came down with typhus. And they had, believe it or not, so to speak, a hospital. There was one room at that bunk, one bunk bed, on one side, one bunk bed on the other side. No blanket, no nothing to cover yourself with, just plain old wood. And I still til today don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t kill her and why they let her stay in that little hospital. She stayed there -- I would check on her every morning when I come in from work, whenever I got off I would always go in to check on her, see how she is. And one morning I came in, she was no longer there. So I went up to the Jewish policeman which I knew, and I said -- his name was Muttle, Muttle Hilf. I said -- I ran into him and I said, Muttle, what Interview with Henry Greenbaum * December 20, 1999 happened to my sister? He said, she died during the night and we already buried her in the bottom of the stone quarry [indecipherable] a stone quarry, and we buried her there, but the two -- one that was two years older than I was. So I was only left with one more sister in the camp, Faige. And I lost her too, as we going to come into it. We stayed there in this camp, then we -- the -- the Russians advanced a little bit from the east coming in, and then we could hear the artillery pounding already and we knew something was going on. So my sister Faige and this Jewish policeman got together, and there was another Jewish policeman who -- his name was Moishe Herblum, he was sort of related to us, a distant cousin. She and him got hooked up to work out some way that we going to try to escape from that place. And I came home from the shift -- that -- that shift I had from three to 11 that e -- in the night. Came home 11, she looked me up, my sister and she says, we\u2019re going to escape tonight, don\u2019t tell anybody, no one. I said, okay. So she -- I said, when am I going to know when to run? She says, I'll come and get you. So she says, just be ready, stay in front of the door in -- of the barrack and I'll come and get you. She and the policeman came along and got me. By that time other people knew it already too, because I saw a lot of commotion, people were running. And somebody got into the -- to the barbed wire and cut through the barbed wire. And as we were running, the ike -- the cue was if the lights are off, we run. So the lights were off. So Interview with Henry Greenbaum * December 20, 1999 the people what their mission was to cut the wires, they did the job. And a lot of people was -- tried to fight through that little area to get out, and they got entangled to one another, and a lot of commotion. By that time the guard heard a lot of -- more noise going on, so he took the lights and put the searchlight towards that area where he heard the noise and he saw people were running out. He opened fire and I was running with my sister and the Jewish policeman together, and I got hit in the head, wounded, and I dropped. My sister, after I dropped I don\u2019t know what happened to her, o-or to the policeman. I know people were running back, the lights went on and people were running in every direction, in, out, in and out. Somebody jumped on me with a [indecipherable] and put a scar on here, I was bleeding from here, I was bleeding from my head until I -- they were stampeding me. So I finally woke up and came -- a few seconds, I came up to myself, I said -- I started screaming for my sister, Faige, Faige, and I didn't hear from her. So I said to myself, why don\u2019t I go into he -- the women\u2019s barrack and look for her. So, I was a little bit disor-oriented, I didn\u2019t know which -- I lost a lot of blood, and I did manage to go into the women\u2019s barrack, which she shouldn\u2019t have gone in, but I took a chance, I went in there. The -- the lady in charge of the barrack was one of our Jewish women from our city, so I knew her, sort of. So I figured she\u2019s not going to bother me too much. I went, Faige, Faige in th -- in the barracks, no Faige. So my -- my first cousin, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Henry Greenbaum * December 20, 1999 Ida, she was my first cousin, she says, what are you sh -- she says, what are you looking for? I was looking for Faige, have you seen Faige? She says no, she\u2019s not here. And then she saw I was bleeding [indecipherable] from my head, so she grabbed that shirt, dipped it in some water [indecipherable] I put it on my head, tried to stop the bleeding, and -- and I couldn\u2019t leave that women\u2019s barracks that night, I had to stay overnight there, underneath th-the last bunk, I squeezed myself underneath there. And she told me to hold this over my head, which I did. And then- because all night long they were -- they were angry that we were trying to escape, so they were shooting all night long into the barrack with the -- with the rifles, boom, boom -- with the machine guns, boom, boom, boom, boom, all night long, until early in the morning it stopped, I snuck out of there and went into -- back to my barrack. And three days later the rumor was sure, that we are going to be shipped out. My sister didn\u2019t tell me that, but that\u2019s the reason they wanted to escape, because we going to be shipped out. And one to the other was talking, they said here we helping, actually, the Germans. Everybody has a job, we work in the ammunition factory, and all kind of copper foundries, each one had a job. We were actually helping the Germans, and if they ship us out of here, where can they take us? To probably [indecipherable] extermination camp. We didn't know. So my sister was trying to escape with me and the policeman. Now, the rumor later was Interview with Henry Greenbaum * December 20, 1999 around, saying that the underground was supposed to have met us there. There was - the way they worked it out, they wouldn\u2019t tell me anything about it, they didn\u2019t want me to know, in case I get caught or something, so I don\u2019t have nothing to tell them. It was all arra -- arranged with the partisans, who were supposed to meet that- at 11 - 12 o\u2019clock in the night, and to eliminate the guard and knock the lights out. And it so happened there was an air raid, so the lights went off anyway, and there was -- got a little bit mixed up. It so happened that the -- the partisans never showed. Maybe they got some problems, they never showed. So we proceeded with our stuff that we said we going to do, we did. So, a lo -- some of them did escape, I don\u2019t know how many, so the next morning roll call they wanted to see how many escaped, so they chased everybody out from the barracks and they would start to count the names and the -- and they marched us over to the place where -- where we were trying to escape, we cut through the wires. And right in the front of us there was the policeman, wounded. My sister was there, but she was dead. But there was about, I would say 10 - 15 people laying there, moaning and moaning and groaning, blood -- lot of blood flowing around and -- and they made us look and they took the machine gun and killed every one of them. And they said this is the lesson that you will learn. If you escape, that\u2019s what will happen to you. So from now on, stay put, Interview with Henry Greenbaum \u201c December 20, 1999 don\u2019t -- don\u2019t escape any more. And this is the lesson that we learned right there. And sure enough, within about four or five days later we were shipped out of there."

And all the trouble started during the day. If they needed extra help they Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Henry Greenbaum *\u00b0 December 20, 1999 would come in and drag you out of bed, and go do extra work, plus he makes sure he brings you back so you can go on the regular shift.

But he would come in during the day and have everybody outside and he would -- like target practice, he would have you walk a straight line. If he knew you were sick in bed -- so-sometime you would see people laying on the bed with foaming from their mouth from the high fever from the typhus. I had the typhus too. So-Some -- sometime maybe [indecipherable] or heavy, I don\u2019t know what it is. My sister, the one who died, she had typhus, but for her, hers turned into the tu -- tuberculosis I think it turned into, she never recovered, she died. They let her die on her own. That was in the a -- in the camp yet. And what -- he would bring them 1n and he made you walk a straight line. If you did -- if you wiggled a certain way, he would put a bullet in the back of your head. And this was like ta-target practice for him. And he had other accomplices come with him, to show them what he is doing. Trying to show them that gee, he could do that too. To harden them up, I guess, like weren't hard enough. And I remember one of my neighbors, his name was Luther, I don\u2019t know his last name, he was my -- my age, and he had a bad case, cause he was foam -- I remember seeing him in the morning, he was foaming from the mouth. And he would tell us to go out, so we had to leave, you could not stay inside or he would Interview with Henry Greenbaum \u201d December 20, 1999 kill you in your -- in your bunk if you stayed. And he -- that\u2019s how he died, because he was wiggling when he was walking, his fever was so high that he could not walk straight line. So therefore he shot him in the back of the head. This is the only one that I saw him shooting, by the way, but he would do that every so often, every so often. I remember this young man when he was my friend, he was my neighbor before, we were living near each other. We were the tailors and they were the carpenters. Yeah, we knew each other pretty good."

My sister didn't want to tell me, but then we found one another to see how they -- the people were trying to work this out with the -- with the partisans somehow. And they pulled up the train and the camp was maybe a block away from the -- from the railroad. We could see the railroad yard from far away. You know, it wasn\u2019t that far, 1t wa -- maybe it was longer than a block, but we could see the cattle cars. And one day they told us to line up in the morning, and Interview with Henry Greenbaum \" December 20, 1999- and march towards the railway yard. Well again the beatings [indecipherable] on the way it was the same thing, that we would walk past the -- it was constantly beating, beating with the long whips, just like -- just like the cowboys here with the herd of cows trying to round them up, it\u2019s constantly beating, beating, beating. When we finally came towards the railroad yard they started to line up people. See, you go -- to what wagon to go into, push them in. And we were packed in, 125 to 150, I would say, approximately to 1 -- to each car. They would set us down between each other\u2019s legs so that we could fit more in. And then once was full, he s- closed the door up and sealed it up so no one can open it up. And they finally, after leaving and we got through, we finally pulled away, we could hear the locomotives, the noise of locomotives and we were heading out, we were three days on the road. No water. We stopped at every station. We didn\u2019t know where we were going, but we stopped in so many stations, I know, because this was not a priority train, the army has to go through first, so there was -- they let everybody else go, but we stopped in so many stations, and in unison, I remember we were screaming, wasser, wasser, wasser, and the Germans know what wasser means, because in their -- German language | think it\u2019s the same. We didn\u2019t ask them to feed us, all we asked, water, water. No water was given, nothing at the station. We finally did arrive -- we finally did arrive at the destination in three days fa -- after three days Interview with Henry Greenbaum \u201c December 20, 1999 you finally arrived in this camp, it was very scary for me personally, with -- to see all these electric wires with the -- with the current would kill us, with seven foot tall, they had to be at least, or 10 foot tall. It was a different ballgame there. And as we were looking through the barbed wire, we saw people walking around with skeletons, with thin and striped cap and a striped uniform an-and wooden shoes, we already saw that. But the people who came to meet us in the front of the car, they pushed those little carts. And they came and told us in Yiddish that this is [speaks Yiddish here] we were burning, we were burning the Jews here. This 1s not a work camp, this 1s strictly a killing camp. And that\u2019s when we first got to know about this from the -- from the people from within the camp, when they met us in front of the railroad yard. Then they opened up the -- the car, each car -- each car separately, and they were saying, raus, raus. Again the same thing started with selection. Right, left, right, left. Even -- even we were all, so to speak, the cream of the crop. We were working. We -- we were healthy, so to speak. Still they wanted, still line up again people, and they put them off to one end, and we went to the other end. They took the -- the one end away, we don\u2019t know what happened to them, til we found out later on that they took them for gas and killing and then -- and [indecipherable] right away. With us they took us over [indecipherable] a little bit younger, they took us over and we marched towards the inside, I remember. And Interview with Henry Greenbaum * December 20, 1999 we came up to a big table, and there were SS men sitting at the table, there must be about 10 of them, and they had some kind of instruments 1n their hands. And that\u2019s where they were tattooing us. So we rolled up our sleeve and they gave us our numbers on the arms."

We were tattooed, then they checked us over, they told us to go into [indecipherable] the barbers were standing, and women and men, their hair was cut off. Before, in our camp, where we came from, the -- the Jewish population in that camp, the women wore the hair. They cut their own a little bit shorter, but when we came to Auschwitz, they chopped all the hair off, they took off that the girls looked like boys already, everybody looked the same. And that\u2019s when they noticed, the barber, I don\u2019t know whether he was a German, or whether he was one of the -- from the camp workers [indecipherable] but he asked me about my wound. The first time. He asked me about my wound so I told him I had a fight inside the car. We were pushing each other trying to get to the -- which was true, we were trying to get to that little window to get a breath of air. And there was fighting, really fighting going on in Interview with Henry Greenbaum \u201c December 20, 1999 that car with us. And then -- so I told him I got hurt that way. He took -- he didn\u2019t question me after that. Shaved if off. It felt better after he cut away all the hair, but again it still was infected. And after the haircut they told us we had to go get a shower. So they lined us up again and like in a maze where you couldn\u2019t get out any more. You got in, you couldn\u2019t get out. And we went in, they gave us -- they told us to leave our clothes on the inside and when we came out on the other end of the shower, we had our striped uniforms ready with our wooden shoes and we got dressed, went back into the barrack and we stayed there in the barrack. Finally somebody brought in some buckets of water to get -- to get drink. And you could have dranked up a whole bucket yourself as thirsty we were. And we -- they delivered the water and then during the night -- during the night was a terrible noise going on next door to our barrack. Very noisy."

Black bread and some ersatz coffee, which was imitation black coffee, we had that in the morning, early. And after that, eating for three days and drinking, this was like nothing compared to what we did where we were before. But a little bit more to eat, we had extra soup over there because we -- when we went to the factory, in the Arbeitslager. But here so far we didn\u2019t get just -- just this bread in the morning and the watery soup in the evening.

            "answer": "Well, Buna was a little bit cleaner than Auschwitz because Buna was already like a working camp. At least we didn\u2019t have any crematoriums in there. They did have punishment by hanging in that camp, but not crematorium, no burning people in that -- Buna-Monowice. And this man picked us up and the job that I was assigned to was to I.G. Farben company. And so anyway, so we did get -- we were still able to get a little bit extra soup over there in the -- in the Monowice in the factory. So we would get -- actually you would get a piece of bread in the morning in -- in Buna with the black imitation coffee. Then around one, two o\u2019clock in the afternoon they give you a little water soup, a little bit extra. And then when we came home, to home, when we came home back to the camp, we got another watery soup. You had a spoon with you, but believe me you didn\u2019t need a spoon, there was nothing there to eat with a spoon. There was cabbage, you couldn\u2019t find a piece of cabbage. Or turnips, you couldn\u2019t find a piece of turnip. It was just watery soup, you could drink it. So that made us a little better in that camp, I think, it looked a little bit cleaner too in th -- in that Buna camp. Like I say, every morning we would get up, and -- get up in the morning, get to -- get this little piece of bread and on the way you would -- sometimes they would transport us by truck. If it was foggy -- they used to be very foggy sometimes there that you couldn\u2019t see but maybe 10 - 15 feet away in front of you. So they would put us in trucks to take us to the factory Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Henry Greenbaum \u201d December 20, 1999 back. But of course -- and in the factory the same thing what happened there. We didn\u2019t get as much beating, but you still had guards with you, so you had to watch your [indecipherable] you couldn\u2019t talk to one another. If we did, we -- he\u2019d -- in the evening -- they wouldn\u2019t bother you while you were talking, but before you left to go back to the camp, they would call you into a certain area, you know, like an office where they were and they would ask you, why were you talking so much to this man? What were you talking about? What we talking about, we hungry, we talking about food. We talk about -- we not have -- and we talk about the families we lost, that kind of talk, that\u2019s all the talking that we did. And one day he didn\u2019t take -- he didn\u2019t take that and he gave us -- there were chairs that you put your head through, your knees on the ground, your stomach on the seat of the chair, and they take your -- take your shirt off and they would give you a whipping with a whip. And when you get through, your back looked like a city map, a road map, with the beating that we used to get.

That was his punishment, that\u2019s only no -- that\u2019s the only thing I know about it.

So this captain, I remember he had two little bars on the top of his shoulder, I think he was a captain, I can\u2019t remember his Interview with Henry Greenbaum \u201c December 20, 1999 name. And he says he gave orders that Sunday after liberation, the non-Jews -- that the Gentiles are going to church, they cannot go to church that day. And then he had all the carpenters build boxes, coffins. And they came over there and they had to dig out the grave, that was hardly covered. The Germans, they had to take the -- the Germans had to go down there and they take the bodies -- we -- were seeing -- we see -- that\u2019s where we saw that this -- these people belonged to our group, that we lost three nights before we were liberated. And I remember seeing the soldiers, American soldiers crying, they were -- tears came out of there. And usually a soldier is harder, th-they\u2019re tough. But they were saying how these people got killed and shot in the head. It was just inhumane. And they made these people put them in boxes and they put them on a truck and they took them to a regular cemetery there in -- near Neuenburg [indecipherable] and they put them in the cemetery, all in one grave, but each wa -- each body in a coffin, that I do remember. And that was just three days, they didn\u2019t -- their luck was not there. When I was liberated I did see a few of my friends, yes, from my own town, even, that we got -- th-then we had a -- from out of town we had a lot of that we\u2019ve got -- became friends with. We stuck together, a-all til I was separated an-and sent to this country and they went to England, some of them. Interview with Henry Greenbaum \u00b0\u00b0 December 20, 1999"
