There was anti-Semitism but we were used to it and that was part of life, so rta. So we accepted it as it is."

            "answer": "Well, yes, there was plenty. I, myself, before th e war, my looks are not, t ypical sort of Jewish. I have blue eyes and not a typical. I used to be able to walk on the other side where the church was standing, the Polish church. It was called Koschua (?) in Rovno where I observed and read the literature put out in front of the church against the Jews and anything that was possible to print and make hatred. So I used to relay th is information to others because it was a little dangerous to walk on the other side of the street. And that\u2122s the only kind of a thing. I came across, myself, before the war, cer tain episodes like, when I used to walk to visit my father in Abarrov. I had to pass a little section where onl y Polish people live and as I was walking some youngsters would attack Jewish guys. The episode was that as I was walking on the street, one was screaming in Polish, \ufb01Der is Yid, der is Yid_______. That means, \ufb01is a Jew, catch him.\ufb02 When the other friend of his came and said are you a Jew, I said where, where is the Jew? And somehow because of that asking the question where is the Jew, he was puzzled. He didn\u2122t know I was Jewish and he let me go. This is the ki nd of things as youngsters we knew. There was anti-Semitism."

Where they made them eat non-kosher foods, they didn\u2122t allow them to kill like the Jewish way of kosher, and I think the woman was called Madame Priestaroba that was in charge of all this business.

                "\ufb02 Sure. One June the 22 nd, early in the morning about 4 o\u2122clock in the morning, being that I was on the border and working on the railroad at that particular town_________, in the morning I saw airplanes overhead fighting with Russian airplane s. That was the start of the war. Already I saw one airplane shot down by the German airplane s and that pilot landed not far from us. He parachuted out. I saw the Germans were flyi ng around him while he was being parachuted and they were shooting at him flying down. They made a few holes in the parachute, but they didn\u2122t get him and he safely landed. That\u2122s how we knew that something was going on between the Germans and the Russians. At 12 0\u2122clock that day, the, Molotov at the time, announced that there was war and attack on Russia and there wa s war between Russia and Germany. The first few hours while I was there, the railroad lines between___________and Lutzk was cut. So, we already were paralyzed on the railroad because the Germans bombarded the railroad and no trains were coming into our sta tion. My chief of the station knew about that, that we were paralyzed. He was upset, he had his whole family, he was a Russian. He was the chief of that station, and I worked under his command. And, he said to me that you stay over here I will take my family with the children and take them out to the city of Lubov. I saw that there was no reason for me to stay at the station because there was no communication and there was no connection between the stations already, because we were cut off, and I was upset about staying all by myself in that station. I knew the Germans were close by, so I said why do I have to stay here, there is nothing to do anyway now, why won\u2122t I go with you and help you to evacuate your family to Lubov and then we will together co me back to the station to work. Well, he agreed and it was my luck, we camouflaged, it was the only locomotive left on the station. We camouflaged one of the cars traveling to Lubov. We never made it back, because the Germans occupied that part and from ther e on we did not stop in Lubov, but we got connected to another transport and we traveled towards the Russian territory in the east, by train, and we had, I remember, a open platform train, where old cars were open like platforms and we took that train and we traveled to Rovno which took us a couple of days. I would say about three days to travel from Lubov to Rovno because of the bomba rdments from the air by the Germans. Every time we heard airplanes we had to stop the trains, run off to the sides, hide because they were shooting, they were flying very low and shooting at us with the automatic machine guns from the airplanes. When they were gone, we continued until I came to__________where I was still assigned to the railroad and this_________, which I mentioned before was twelve kilometers from Rovno. I think it was June the 25 th. Being that___________ was only twelve kilometers from Rovno and my family lived in Rovno, and I didn\u2122t see them for a long time, I decided to go to Rovno to see my family. I was assigned to a post to be back at 10 o\u2122clock at night, to watch a certain part of the main terminal of__________and I was free until 10 o\u2122clock that evening. So I went to Rovno and met my family. "

During the day the German airplanes used to fly in and bombard sections of the city. In order for my family to be safer, I told them to move to a section which was called Kapkaz that was the other part of the city, like one section is towards east of the city like facing the Russians and we had an uncle who was the keeper of the synagogue.

                " To bring them over to that part of the town was already late and I had to go back to____________where I was assigned to be there at 10 o\u2122clock. Because about 7:30 or 8\u2122clock, I left my family, I said goodbye to my father, my w hole family and (a portion of tape is blank). ",
                " I am going to repeat a few sentences. When I brought my family over to Kafkaz it was late in the day and I had to go back to Slobonov where I was assigned. We didn\u2122t know at the time that the Germans are going to take over most of the territory. We figured it\u2122s just a temporary thing and the Russians are going to be able to fight back the German s and life is going to go on normal. I was responsible for my job where I wa s in Slobonov so I had to leave my family. My mother did not want me to go back. She insisted I should stay with the family, in that synagogue. I spoke to my father, he was more lik e sort of reasonable, and he said to me, I remember and I\u2122ll never forget it, he said, my son, you are a grown man, you have to make your own decisions what to do. If you think that it is important for you to go back, then you have to go back. So I had no problems with my father, but my mother wa s insisting I should stay with them. I made up my mind to go back because I fe lt that if I don\u2122t, I will be responsible for the job I\u2122m supposed to do on the railroad in Slobonov because it is a major depot place where soldiers and with the Russian soldiers and they ha d to be transported from one place to the other and it was important for me to be there. So, I said to my parents th at I\u2122m going to be there tonight. After I finish my job in the morning I\u2122 ll see you back. I\u2122ll come back to the city and see you again. On the way to Slobonov walking, I walked out about six kilometers, about half way, from the city of Rovno to Slobonov there was an attack. It was sort of getting dark that day, already late in the day, and I was walking with the road of the railroad, that\u2122s how I came to Slobonov and a lot of planes were coming toward s us and there were another few people and everyone was hiding and I was also hiding from the airplanes. We didn\u2122t know they were going to attack us, they were flying very low and I saw them go towards Rovno, towards the city of Rovno. A few minutes later I looked out, all the airplanes they spread like sort of in one line and they attacked the city of Rovno from one e nd to the other. And a few minutes later I saw the whole city burning. I was six kilometers out of the city. It wa s very hard for me to make a decision what to do now. I didn\u2122t know whether my family was killed at the time or not, because the city was on fire from one end to the other. I made a decision to go to work because I figured like that. If I don\u2122t go to work and nothing happened to my family I would be a deserter, because I was sort of mobilized alrea dy by the Russian army to be on the railroad, and then they will kill me as a deserter, the Russian government. If my family is dead, I won\u2122t see them anyhow. So I decided that in the morning when I finish my work, I will run back to the city. Being that I came back to Slobonov I wa s on my place of work, watching the cars on the outside. I was assigned to that, we had a few attacks in the middl e, like already dark later on, we had attacks by the German airpla nes on the railroad, on the station. "

And I ran out to the outskirts of Slobonov. We went into a house a few kilometers from the depot, from the Slobonov station and I walked into the house and I said I have to stay here, I have to rest until this thing is over and I\u2122ll have to rest here in your house and the woman did not disagree, she let us in, there were a few men already sleeping on the floor, and she said I have no room, the only place I have is on the floor. If you want to accept it, it\u2122s O.K. I asked her, I said please, if I fall asleep, wake me up, but early, ea rly in the morning. Being that I was tired and I didn\u2122t sleep for a few days, traveling from Lubov to Rovno, I was ve ry tired so I fell asleep on the floor. I was so tired that the woman just co uldn\u2122t get me up early in the morn ing and she let me sleep. She didn\u2122t know the reason why I had to be up early. About 8 o\u2122clock, sort of, in the morning I got up. I said, why didn\u2122t you wake me up, I was supposed to be on the station working. Well, I walked out of the house and I ran towards the station where I was supposed to be working. As I came close to the rails, I saw German tank facing a column of Russian soldiers with their gun from the tank pointing at them and all the Russian s with their hands up were standing in front of their building from that colum n. And I couldn\u2122t figure it out that the Germans were there already because I didn\u2122t see Germans until that poin t, that was the first tank I ever saw German except in the air, the bombardment. So I walked around behind the tank."

So I walked right up. It was an uphill, I walked up to the railroad and I went into the station and I took a look. During the night most of the trains and locomotives were evacuated going east while I was asleep and I didn\u2122t see anybody on the station. Everybody was evacuated. It was empty. It was a very f oolish, stupid episode that if you\u2122re interested I\u2122ll tell you that I carried a little suitcase, I had some underwear, clothes that I had and I put it in a warehouse when I came down with the train fr om Slobonov originally, and it was in that warehouse. I figured if I have to run I got to have my suitcase so I ran to that warehouse and there was still an old woman closi ng up to run away too. I said to her, I have my suitcase with my clothes in it, I would like to get it. There were hundreds of suitcases lying there, I was looking for my personal suitcase which didn\u2122t have much to look at and I found my suitcase and with the suitcase I ran towards the smoke that I saw going east from the chimney. The smoke was coming out of the locomotives, they were going one after the other probably about two kilometers away from the station already."

When he saw me run he slowed down and he picked me up. And on that locomotive I was until we got into Russia. Never had a chance to go back to Rovno to see if my family was alive or dead.

So as th e Russians, which most of the time they were retreating, the Russian army, we were like sort of behind the lines traveling back and forth in case the government would need a transport for so me reason. So I was on the railroad for six months, just living in cars with a whole group, hundreds of people, of railroad people, that worked on the railroad for the purpose of re storing the railroad if it was bombarded, for transporting military back and fort. So my job at the time was just to travel. That\u2122s why I lived and as the Russians were retreating so did we with the transport we were retreating. Where we got up to a town further away from Harkov. I don\u2122t remember that town that we stayed. As I was working on the station over there we actually parked at that place and we worked at the station and I used to go out to see all the transports that were coming by this station going east towards Russia and they called them_________, people that run away from the occupied areas of Germany, people that were running away from the front. Whoever could evacuate themselves, they were passing by our station and I was checking every car to look for relatives, friends from the city of Rovno. Whether they were passing by t oo. And I looked into every car as they were coming by. I met one guy and he was a son of one of our landlords and he knew my family very well.

Rovno the city of Rovno remained under the Russian government after the war, because this was part of the Ukraine and never changed hands back to Poland. On the way back I managed to get out of Russia and we were supposed to travel towards Kovid, it\u2122s a city, Kovid, and my transport got diverted instead of going to Kovid, went towards Rovno. Overnight was traveling and in the morning I get up and I walk out on the station and when I opened up the doors, we stopped at that station, and as I opened up the door I see a church, the one I mentioned before, a Polish church, which I recognized, I figured that every city in Poland, I knew I was in Poland but I didn\u2122t know which town, I figured in my mind that every city in Poland ha s a church like that. So I say this must be Poland already, because I see the church is just like the one we had in Rovno. The rest of the town was completely bombarded, it was leveled. So as I walk out of the station, I didn\u2122t recognize the station, it was also bombarded, demolished, and I asked one man that was passing by, I asked him, I say what city is this? He says to me this is R ovno. Can you imagine the guy telling me, I was born in Rovno, I knew the whole city and I didn\u2122t recognize it. Only recognized the church that was sticking out. It looked like they never aimed at churches or big synagogues because that survived in the city in Rovno."

The whole city was rebuilt. It had only happened a few years ago when I was there. When I saw this in Rovno, I wasn\u2122t able to remain because my transport was going toward Kovid a nd Krakow and I had to stay on the transport that was taking me out of Russia until I came to the borders of Poland, and we entered Poland somewheres near Krakow. When I first got off, on the first station as we entered Poland in 1946, we saw the Polish officers, checking us out and we immediately noticed the antiSemitism right away was worse than it was in Ru ssia. They greeted us with hatred and you can understand what kind of feeling I had and I thought I made a mist ake coming back to Poland. I came back to Poland only to have freedom, but I didn\u2122t find it in the behavior of the Polish people. So I traveled from there to a town which was Bittem. It was somewheres, I think it was__________, the town of Bittem. It used to be a German, a lot of German people used to live there before the war. When I came to the town a group of Zionist, young people, came to the transport and asked all the young Jewish people that came from Russi a to join the Zionist organization and from there go to Israel. Being that I was single and I didn\u2122t find my family, I knew I was all alone and young, I decided to join this organizati on which I was with them for quite a while and working with the organization in Bittem. If it was of interest to you, this whole organization was trying to snuggle into Isr ael. It was Palestine at the time, under the British occupation and the situation at that time before the Jewish State was established, was controlled by the British and they didn\u2122t allow any Jewish people to settle, they took them all to Cypress and other camps where they caught them on the open seas. But, nevertheless, we all tried very hard to get there one way or the other, because Poland was no more a place for Jews. During the time I was in that particular place, I was assigned from the organization to go on the market and buy out all the soap, which was ca lled Rif, in Germany it was called__________, it was made out of Jewish people and openly the German people on the market were selling that particular soap in bags. It looks like it must ha ve been with the help of the Israeli government or the Jewish government, we used to buy that soap out of the markets, wherever we saw it being sold and eventually, I understand it, that so ap went to Israel, it was buried because it was made out of Jewish people\u2122s fat. So this was on e of my jobs in that pa rticular organization in Bittem. We also tried to find children, Jewish children that were kept in some Christian homes and we tried to buy them out from the Christian people to be able to go back to Israel. And we managed to find a lot of Jewish children thro ugh certain ways and investigations who had children like that. Some Christian, Polish familie s took in very, very young Jewish children and they kept them as their own. Which was very nice. Some Christian families did not want to give up their children. But a lot of them decided to allow them to go back to Israel where they belong and we paid, the Jewish government, the Israeli governm ent paid a certain amount for them as a price for the good deeds that they di d. Later on, I am not going to go into details about what happened when Poland attacked, the Polish government attacked our house."

An order came for us to depart Bittem, start going towards sort of Italy and we had to go to another town which was called Katowice and from Katowice we had special pape rs made for us like new names and the names were given to all the ninety people, more than ninety because families of these youngsters that lived outside of this particular building were also taken at the same time so all of us were given Greek names, each one had a Greek name sort of, that we were not Jews but Greeks escaping, going to Greece and we got false documents with Polish stamps that we were Greeks and in the middle of the night, one night, we smuggled the border from Poland to Czechoslovakia. We had a special guide in the middle of the night. Old and young, were walking through the woods in the dark and people were falling and it was raining that night, and was mud on our feet, but we had to go as fast as possible because the guide he knew the way and he was going fast. So the whole length of that echelon, all the people that were going in one line sort of, it stretched for a long way, we managed to get in to Czechos lovakia. And we had an assigned building that was waiting for us. They took us to that partic ular house. We came in all muddy with shoes full of mud and wet. We had to wash ourselves ou tside in the middle of the night and from there we had to go, the woman from the house took care of us, and we had something to eat and early in the morning they brought a tr uck, a flat truck sort of, maybe about two feet high, flatbed not covered, they took all the older people and the children, the young children, on that truck, and it traveled to Bratislava. Lying down on the tr uck like from________, that wa s the town that we started, right on the border to Bratislava, the older people were lying and they were covered with a canvas, and that\u2122s how they traveled all the way to Bratislava to a hotel where they had in Bratislava for the refugees. The younger pe ople were assigned to go by train so being that________ is a tiny little town, didn\u2122t see too many people, slowly two by two, a boy and a girl, walked towards the train station and we want ed to buy tickets. As we went to the station, two by two, not in a group, the station manager, whoever was there, noticed that so many people are here. He never had that many people goi ng by train to Bratislava that he called the police, the Czechoslovakian police, the polic e came and arrested us. Naturally we had documents that we were Greeks so we had t o, Greek we did not know how to speak, so we spoke whatever we knew in the Seder, in the pray ing book, so sort of this kind of language sort of we spoke. We didn\u2122t understand each other, bu t we made believe that we speak Greek. They arrested us, the whole group. A Jewish organi zation in Bratislava found out that we were arrested by the Czechoslovakian police, they work ed very hard and they got us out and they transferred us to Bratislava into that hotel wh ere we were going to leave Czechoslovakia. They didn\u2122t want us there. So we were lucky that they didn\u2122t send us back to Poland because we really smuggled out of that country with false papers. When we got to Bratislava they organized a group of, about 200 people, to go to th e border to come to Vienna. The leadership that was in charge of that group had a pe rmission to take out twenty people out of Czechoslovakia on the border crossing. They made 200 out of that twenty, they added another zero and they took 200 people on that particular document. When we came to the border, they gave the Czechoslovakian guard on the border a couple of cartons of American cigarettes. So we crossed the border and now we are in no-ma n\u2122s land. We came to the Russian side which was part of Vienna."

            "question": "The Russian occupation zone?",
            "answer": "The Russian occupation zone of Vienna. They gave them a couple of bottles of vodka and they let us through. So we boarded a streetcar in Vienna and with the streetcar we went to the American side of Vienna and we stayed in th e Rothschild Hospital in Vienna. That was like sort of a place, we organized th at hospital as a transition place, a place for refugees until it was time to go further towards Italy. My uncle Men achim was with me at certain times. He found me in Russia. That was my mother\u2122s youngest br other. He was in the Russian army and then he was bombarded and shot. He wound up in certain parts of Russia where he found me accidentally and I was with him at certain places. Which, if you ar e interested, later on I will go into it. He volunteered during Russia he volunteered to the army and we separated again in Russia. He was in Czechoslovaki a until the end of the war even after the war, fighting Germans and somehow he survived and he wound up in__________, in a camp, displaced persons camp, where he was in sort of citizens police, in camp police, as a policeman. All the Zionist organizations had a conference in this camp a nd through one person at the conference he found out that I was in Vienna on the American side in Rothschild Hospital. That person at the conference took a message to me telling me about my uncle that he is living in_________, which at that time I did not know where it was, and I should pick myself up and travel with the next transport that passes by Linz and he\u2122ll wait for me. Well, I excused myself from this organization because I was with the Zionist organi zation going towards Israel all this time, and I said my uncle was there and if you don\u2122t mind I want to travel to meet him. That was the first relative I ever found since the war started. And, as I was trave ling, they gave me permission and I was traveling towards Linz. He was waiti ng for me, he didn\u2122t know which transport, but he was waiting for one transport to the other until he found me on the transport. But the transport was not supposed to stop in Linz, only stop there for refueling or something, water. That transport was going towards Italy with Jewish people that were going to Israel. And as I came to Linz I knew that somebody was going to wa it for me at the station. I looked out the window and he spotted me and he was in sort of a Jewish with a Star of David on his sleeve, with a whistle on his neck over here with a uniform Jewish Police, with a hat. So somehow the Austrian police at the station allowed him to get me off that transport and take me with him. And that\u2122s how I was able to get into this par ticular camp or displaced persons camp. He signed me into that camp which was a little hard because this particular camp__________ did not allow new people to sign into that camp. The only ones that they allowed was brothers, sisters, relatives that were there and if they found them they allowed them to take into the same room they had in the camp. Because there was no room in this camp for newcomers. He managed to do that by saying that I was his brother, not a nephew and I was ab le to get into this camp under the name of Grossman, which was his name too, my name was changed a few times before that, so I accepted the name Grossman. He accepted the name Grossman because he knew that in America his brothers names were Grossman, so he didn\u2122t want to make complications, so he marked the name Grossman and I became a Gro ssman which I was a few times before when I met him, and that\u2122s how I am a Grossman all th is time it would be too hard to explain to anybody why I am not Tannenbaum, but Grossman. So under Grossman I live in the United States since I came here."

But he never crossed that railroad and the railroad many times was bo mbarded and destroyed and rebuilt and stuff like that. There was an or der by the Russian government to take all these railroad people that were working, hundreds, maybe thousands that were all around Russia, around Moscow, excuse me, to ship them, and they were getting ready in Stalingrad and this must, I don\u2122t remember the time."

            "question": "You passed the winter near Moscow?",
            "answer": "Yes. When I found out that th is transport is going to Stalingr ad and I figure they are pushing, according to the information I got, I knew that I am going to have to fight for Stalingrad and probably get killed like everybody else did. But I decided to go deeper into Russia. And I took a group of four guys, four railroad people that I knew; they were from Kovid, from my area. I told them, I said, now we\u2122re not going to work on the railroad anymore, looks like we\u2122re going into some kind of a different uniform and we\u2122re going to have to fight or shoot or something like that, because the whole transport is going to wards Stalingrad. If you want, I say we should do another thing and go someplace else. Bei ng that we didn\u2122t know where to go, but we decided, all the five of us, decided to escape from that place because we are not needed anymore, in the middle of the night we went from that place. We were not arrested or kept under special supervision, but if somebody would see us go away from that transport they would be suspicious. So in the middle of the night we decided to go to the railroad station that was not far from Zagorsch and go wherever it is possible to go deeper to Russia, deeper in Russia because the Germans were very close. We found, I particular no ticed a transport that was assembled with cars from th e Moscow Metro and they were al ready stationed, they were on platforms, platform beds on the railroad cars and those cars were hooked up next to these particular platform station. I said to my frie nds, I say, look, I don\u2122t know where, but when I was in Moscow I saw these particular cars in the metro, in the unde rground, in the subway. I think that these trains are being evacuated because they are valuable trains, they were very nice and if they are evacuated they are not going to the fr ont they are probably going toward deep into Russia. If we manage to get on this particular train we will probably go towards Russia, because we did not get information where the trans port is going. So that train took off and went to a town of Gorki, which was north and east. It was, now I remember, it was wintertime, it was cold, so it must have been between \u212241 and \u212242, because I froze my hands someplace near Gorki. We went into certain, there were cars, on flatbeds, there were al so trucks standing on the platforms so we managed to get into a door in to the trucks and we were traveling in that particular truck in the cabins all the way to Gorki in the cold. When we got to Gorki, we found out it was Gorki, we really didn\u2122t know that we\u2122r e going to come to Gorki. We came to Gorki we saw a whole transport of wounded soldiers. We were still in the uniform of the railroad. We had our uniforms on. We went in to speak to, there were passenger train, a lot of refugees were there in Gorki and they didn\u2122t allow anybody to hook on to this train because there were wounded soldiers from the front sort of going de ep. Being that they were wounded soldiers, I didn\u2122t think that these soldiers are going toward s the front, they were going to deep into Russia for treatment. So we decided as railroad people to go with them, but they didn\u2122t allow us to go into the inside of the train to the compartments because they were soldiers and we were railroad people, but they allowed us to stay in between th e cars on the outside a nd travel till the next station, maybe we\u2122ll find another transport somepl ace else. We traveled for a while. I know when I came off I was all frozen, my hands were frozen and all the other guys were all frozen traveling in between the trains and we got out of Gorki. We managed to hook onto some refugee trains later on in the cattle cars. When we got into some cars there were also refugees from Europe, from Russia, from all different to wns and we managed to get in there with them, travel to Quebishov, there\u2122s a town Quebishov and from Quebishov they took us to Tashkent, we got off in Tashkent, that\u2122s Asia already. On the way we had a lo t of trouble because the sanitary ways were very bad and we had lice and sicknesses and typhoid and all kinds of sicknesses among the people, but we managed, I managed to get to Tashkent. In Tashkent as a railroad guy and as a student for a certain school in Russia in_________, I made an appointment with the chief of th e railroad from the Tashkent. I was lucky enough that he made an appointment for me to see him and when I got up there, he was an old man, he was the chief, the Kamisar, they call it, and I to ld him that, I told him a little lie , that we were bombarded o the road as I was traveling and my transport that I was with disappeared and I managed to come here and I am looking for a place to live and to st ay and to work on the railroad. Well he gave us a place, he told me O.K., you as a machin ist, you know mechanics, we\u2122ll give you a job on a machine on a certain machine to work, but the other four I don\u2122t have any place except for a place in Tashkent to work on the same machine th at was cutting railroad ties for the railroad. They would be pushing the trees up to the machine by hand and that will be their job. He gave us a place to live in Tashkent, a dorm. They took us into places where we could clean ourselves up and delouse ourselves and we lived there. I lived in Tashkent for about nine months working on that machine, which even though there was hunger and not enough food, but I survived in that place. Before I got the job, I was sleeping in Tashkent on the railway station where every morning hundreds of people died, they took out, they found in the morning. They used to clean up the station, they found dead people from typhoi d that they used to pick him up and just throw him on the wagon. These were all refugees, and I couldn\u2122t live like that, that\u2122s why I went to look for that job, and I was lucky enough to be able to get that job and signed in to Tashkent under the name of Gedale Tenenboim. And I worked there for nine months with the machine in this factory until my uncle, Menachim came down to the station. He passed through Tashkent, he was on his way to the Polish army with a group. He was dismissed from the Russian army, he was wounded in his thigh and his mouth, but the Russia ns did not trust the Polish people to be in the Russian army so they dismissed all the Ukrainian Polish citizens, so that before the Russians took over. They told them that if you want to go and join you can join the____________army in Russia which was forming up there. When he stopped on the way to Guzar which was near the Afghanistan border, that\u2122s where the Polish army made, accepted their recruits. He stopped in Taskent and he f ound a friend from the city of Rovno and he asked him what, who are the people that he knows th at are from Rovno. Maybe there are some people. He mentioned to him that I know ther e is one guy Gedale Tennenboim that comes here every morning, I used to work nights on the machine. In the morning I used to go to the station to look for relatives, whoever passes by or who stops maybe I\u2122ll find some relatives of my mother or father or brothers or sister. He met me and he said, he used to meet me all the time and we used to talk to each other. When he saw my uncle he didn\u2122t know that he was my uncle; he only mentioned my name as there is one guy Gedale Tennenboim that works here in Tashkent. He said Gedale Tennenboim, that\u2122s my sister\u2122s son. To make it short, he went to the____________ bureau in Russia, in Tashkent, wher e everybody that works in the city, not as a refugee, but if he works there has to be signed to the city, signed up as a citizen of the city. I was signed in the books where I work and my name was right there. He looked it up and they told him where I am, he came to the place where I was working and I\u2122m not going to go into the details how we met. It was qui te a scene and he told me th at now that I have found you, you have to go with me. I said I can\u2122t leave the m achine. I\u2122m working at night, night is my time when I have to be at the machine. There are fort y people working on this particular machine. If I don\u2122t show up they can\u2122t work. And he says never mind, he says, you\u2122re going with me. He had a list of about fifteen people that was in a group that was going with him. A lot of them disappeared on the road so the list got smaller and smaller. One of the names from that particular list I took. I don\u2122t remember the name and I decided to go with him. Naturally, I deserted my job and I was shaking pretty badly because if the Russian_________, or the KGB would find me, they would probably hang me. The next morning I was already back on the station with all of the refugees and the way I came to Tashkent and the next morning there was a train going to this particular spot of Guzar_________ near the Afghanistan_______ border where the Polish were recruiting members to go to England from Russia. And I went with him and took one of the names on that list that he had. And on the way ther e was, they call it an ablava the Russian_________ were checking all the people on that station and checking their passports, their names. All my passports, all my documents, all the pictures that I had with me I had to destroy at that particular station. I went into the toilet, threw out all my pictures of my family, of my brothers, whatever I had with me, my parents, all documents under the name of Tenenboim, all my passports, and my documents th at I had and I had to destroy because I was sort of a deserter from this pa rticular work place and that was the end of my name Tenenboim. From there on I took the name what was on that paper, I don\u2122t remember the name because it was a very short time and we went to Cuzar. A nd when I came to Cuzar with my uncle to sign up to the Polish army to fight the Germans from the English side. It was supposed to take all the Polish people. Bring them to sort of Pale stine, from Palestine they took them back to England and fight from maybe down there. I don\u2122t know what the English were going to do with them, but help the English people fight Germ any. And we wanted to sign up. When they took me for a medical examination, which they undr essed us completely. At that particular point in Cuzar I was rejected because they f ound out that I was circumcised and I am Jewish, not Polish even though I spoke Polish and my un cle spoke Polish and we were born in Poland, but because we were Jewish they didn\u2122t accept us. And they gave me a document, in Polish it was written_________. They gave me a document unde r the name of Grisorus which was the original name of my uncle, and I said I am Grisorus and the accepted it, they made me Grisorus and since then I was Grisorus. And I had to leav e. They didn\u2122t accept me or my uncle. From that point on the Russians had to go back to Russia, stay in Russia and they, because I was a Polish born person, they took me to differ ent places of work, camp. They called it___________. That was work, it was an army sort of, out of civilians that were not labor, that were not taken to the Russian army because we we re Polish citizens and they only took us from one camp to another camp and they shipped us to places of work like farms where they needed workers and all kind of different places, from one place to the other. Th e last place that I was, because I can\u2122t go into that cert ain. I have to skip over that."

He decided to volunteer to the army and he escaped from that particular town into the recruiting place of the Russian army. He wanted to volunteer to fight the Germans and anybody that volunteered over there to the Russian army they took, \u201acause they needed people to fight, and he was a ccepted. He left me behind in this particular place, this was Khazikstan and not far from_____________, the place was called Danscoya____________.The place was a place where they were digging ore mines and also had political prisoners. It was 200 kilometers from___________. It was very hard to escape from there because the wilderness was all around the place of Danscoya. You couldn\u2122t escape. Even the prisoners couldn\u2122t escape. It was 200 kilomete rs to walk in the wilderness some wolf or they had wild animals on the road, they w ould eat you up. So nobody could escape from that place and this is the last place I was. When the war ended I tried to sign up as a Polish citizen to go back to Poland. I had to provide certain documents, which I didn\u2122t have under the name of Grisaurus. I showed a picture with epaulets that I kept.. That particular picture I didn\u2122t destroy because there was nothing written, but was only written something in Polish with a stamp on the corner from the school that I went to in Poland in Rovno. And that particular picture I kept with me. I still have it today, a copy of it in my album and because of the epaulets, it was from a Zionist organization, so we had those in Poland and the corner of it was written in Polish from a Polish school. It wasn\u2122t written Rovno because that part of Rovno was not on the picture, like a corner of the picture wa s showing but it was written in Polish so they could read it. They accepted me as a Polish citizen only because of that picture and I was able to get documents to get out of Russia under this picture, under this document. That\u2122s how I came back to Poland where I met my first anti-Semites near Krakow."

And I did everything. I wrote to Mo scow, I wrote to HIAS, I wrote to Yad Vashem in Israel, any organization that is available, private organizati ons, that are searching for people and I never was able to get any information whether they are alive or dead.

I took my wife and my daughter, who was born in the United States, and we went there for a visit to the place where 17,500 Jews of that city was shot, murdered by the Germans with the help of the Ukrainian police over there in the place of Susneke, the woods, which I knew before the war very well and they were all shot. They assembled all the Jews, most of the Jews, and they were shot there between November 6 and 7, 1941, right after the Germans occupied the city. A few months later they destroyed all the Jews. Whatever was left later on, they had another 5,000 Jews and they kept them in ghettos and they were killed also. And another place, which was called Bially Street, I visited that particular place.
