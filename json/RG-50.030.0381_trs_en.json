So, I put down a list of 103 books I know exactly, from different categories, categories and countries. And there was the Scandinavian countries and American literature and, of course, Polish literature, French, all kind. Everything in translation, of course, into Polish, not in the original languages. So I put down a list of 103 books, and Russian literature was a very, very modern at the time , to read the Russian, the Russian literature translated into Polish. And I went to Mrs. Dobnow. Erlich. Dobnow was the daughter of the famous historian Dubnow, wrote the history of the Jews. And she was herself a poet. She was writing poetry in still Russian and knew excellent Polish literature -- altogether a very intelligent and very well educated. His two sons were professors, one of Columbia and the one is who passed away and the one is in Yale. And she was there, I made an appointment with her, and I said, \ufb01Mrs. Dubnow, I want to come and have your opinion,\ufb02 because I didn\u2122t want to rely on myself, that this is right. So I left with her the list of 100 books and she studied it. Then she, I called her, and she said, \ufb01Would you come up? Le t\u2122s have a discussion about it.\ufb02 And there she accepted the 100 books, but one which was called, Cztowiek Zmienia S\u2122ku\u2122re.11 In English, it 11 Bruno Jasienski\u2122s book\u2122s English title is A Man Changes His Skin. 27 would be \ufb01a person changes his skin.\ufb02 It means th at becoming \u0152 changing his ideas, his ideology.

She didn\u2122t want \u0152 she was a little bit, you know\u2013 She was a Bundist, but she didn\u2122t want to start with the Communists. This was my feeling at that time, as young as I was. And I felt it should be there. And we had a big discussion about it. And she told me, \"If you feel so strongly about it, let\u2122s leave it.\ufb02 It was written by Bruno Jasienski, who was a Communist once and he -- who believed in Christ that have to help people and so on. The funniest this was when I came to the United States, and I came to visit her, so she says to me, \ufb01If you feel so strongly about it, let's leave it.\ufb02 The funniest thing was when I came to the United St ates and I came to visit her.

            "answer": "Not exactly, not exactly. I knew that he is involved, but not exactly, he didn't tell me, you know. So over there, how -- it was interesting. Th ey loved Irene, the little baby and whenever -- he sometimes took her on his knee -- the -- the pe asant, Mr. Patoka took -- took her on her knee and they were eating like, potato balls, you know, made. Take matzo balls, you know potato balls. So he took a piece into his mouth, he made it soft and gave it to her. I was looking at it and I was dying, you know. But, didn't say a word about it. There was a little wooden thing for them to give food to the -- to the pigs, they brought it in. So I washed it, I put in water and I bathed Irene. I took her to the fields and I -- I could pick the, what's calle d? Peas, the green peas in this, I took it out and I gave it. I took carrots, I-I grated them, I squeezed out juice to have for her, the juice the -- the -- the you know, the carrot juice, some vitamins . And when the -- the woman, the peasant, she saw this, she says, \ufb01We give it to the pigs, why do you give it to the baby?\ufb02 You 35 know, this kind of things, very primitive, but ki nd. And I think that the soltys, you know what's the soltis, the eldest of the village, who was getting on everything, I think that he guessed who I am, but he never said anything. But one day, he came and he said, \ufb01The Germans are coming for the boys and girls. It would be good for you to escape here from here with the child. I think I wrote about it, you read it. Michal isn't here, I have no addres s for Michal. He was one right here, one right there, didn't know what to do. I had a few, you know, Polish zlotys, but didn't know what to do and I had to go, because if he came to me and said it in a nice way, that he didn't want me, you know, to -- he knew that I woul dn't survive with the child. He said I have to disappear, I have to disappear. And he said, that peasant said there is a brother of the -- his wife in -- near Tuszcz. Tuszcz is -- was the stati on where the train stopped for Treblinka, you know. Tuszcz, Malkinia and Treblinka, this was the -- the route. \ufb01He's a smith (ph), you know and so we can take you there. And maybe until your husband will come, he'll find you.\ufb02 Well, it was quite a few miles. I was carrying Irene you know, w ith the rest of my, of my strengths. He was carrying a little package what I had, you know, diapers, this. And we came there. Well, they were very nice to us because, you know, he says my husband should come, you know and they'll take me away, it's only a matter of a few days. So she was very nice. But somebody pass by from the village where I was before, in the Gleb- Gle boczyce, who said, \ufb01She was there, why is she here? She is probably Jewish.\ufb02 Th is was it. So she came in, the wife and said, \ufb01You cannot stay here any more. You have to go.\ufb02 And then I decided to go to Warsaw. What do I do? I don't know where, no address, no nothing. And Michal wouldn't know where I am. So I said, \ufb01Okay, tomorrow I'll go. You'll take me there to the statio n and I'll go.\ufb02 So then I put Irene to sleep for a nap before the trip. Trip supposed to be one o'clock, two o'clock, I don't remember. And she slept and I was standing at the window and I was crying. And suddenly I see somebody passing by. Michal. And I started to run after him, until I came out. He was very fast walking, he didn't know anything, you know. And -- and he didn't hear me, and he didn't hear me screaming, \ufb01Michal.\ufb02 So I took a stone, I threw at him. So then he turned around, said, \ufb01What you doing here?\ufb02 And I told him the whole story. This was a miracle, co mplete miracle. So he came into the apartment 36 and then the -- when the smith (ph), you know, he said, you know, was talking to him and just looking him up and down and he said, \ufb01What do you do?\ufb02 And he says, \ufb01Oh, I am a mechanic, you know, this, that.\ufb02 So he looks at his hand an d said, \ufb01You are not a mechanic. Doesn't look like it.\ufb02 And we left. I with Michal, we left. And he took me to pref -- you know, we're afraid of the train, you know. People were -- this was a station where everybody was running here and there. So he took me there, he took me to Wa rsaw, we took a -- a carriage, you know, a -- s-same is standing in Central Park. And we got off about two blocks before it's destination, which was a very old -- she was a concierge, that woman an d the -- for that buildi ng where he took me. And this was a very narrow, little room where th ere were already three woman living. The -- the owner -- the -- the -- the concierg e with a little boy and I come and with Irene and Michal. He found it, somebody told him, but he lived not far away, one block away. He lived there, lived, you know, slept. This was the -- the -- the worker where he -- whom he met in the street, what are you doing, and he gave him -- said threw he ca n stay with him. He was very nice too, that man. He was helping for awhile and then he chan ged his mind and started to talk. So we -- we went there and I had the little narrow bed for Irene and myself and we cont acted the -- Gina, she was working in Warsaw. And Gina came, you know and what do we do? We cannot stay here, everybody will know. And we decided to separate Irene from us, for her to be safe. Cause we knew that we'll perish, this way, another way. It's impossible to live through the whole thing, impossible. So let Irene stay, you know, at least. And we talked it over with Gina, and Gina said, \ufb01I have somebody.\ufb02 And she said, where she gave her exam for nursing -- which was international -- the Ministry, she had to go through the Ministry of -- of Health and Education, Dr. Zachert. \ufb01She seemed to me a very nice pe rson,\ufb02 she said, \ufb01when she -- when she examined me. I'll call her.\ufb02 She called her, sh e had already papers and she called her and she said that her -- she want to see her, because she want to -- advice from her. She said, \ufb01Of course, come.\ufb02 A very nice person. And she went up and when she told her over the phone that she's on the Juzwiak. So she said, \ufb01You are not Juzwiak. You are a Gina Kl epfisz. Please come in.\ufb02 And she told her the story, she has a brother and a sister-in-law and a baby and sad situation, what can we do? She 37 was also the director of the orphanage, Boduena. Priest Boduen was called. She says, \ufb01I can take the baby to the orphanage as an orphan, but not knowing that she's an orphan and she has to be left in the street and I'll take her ove r.\ufb02 And here starts the whole thing.

She didn't cry at night, you know, all th e time. So they told me to go and I went out and I was walking around the block, it was evening, around the blocks, I wasn't afraid that somebody can catch me. And I was wa lking probably for a half an hour or more, even. And then I hear somebody grabs me. It was one of the -- said, \ufb01What do you think, going in such a cold time, all around? Why don't you come back? I told you take only five, 10 minutes, that's all. You -- you can get, you know, a pneum onia or something like that, come in.\ufb02 This were the women.

And the children, the two younger children, she was going once a week to another town, where she had an uncle, a priest, Lowicz, to Lowicz, and bring food. Sour cream, butter, cheeses, you know, all kind of things. A lot of it, he'd star t to prepare for her when she's coming and she could sell to the neighbors, because we couldn't get it.

Through her I had a telephone there, Michal could call me. And I had a lot of contacts. Over there was living one woman and also she was a teacher and she wa s very -- and she probably guessed, we never talked about it, but I\u2122m sure she guessed w ho I am. What I am, you know, who I am. I found 17 Mrs. (Polish). 18 ID card (German). 41 another one, also a friend of hers and that woman, where I could put my friend, Halinka Ellenbogen. She was also a maid someplace. She was always with swollen knees because she was on the floor, you know, washing the floors. I never did this kind of thing. And she was crying and this and that, but she looked very well, you know, like really Aryan. She used to come up to me and I gave her a place to live not far from me. She was also a teacher. And she had, and then I gave her the place with Dr. Zachert in Boduen, so she saw Irene every day. And so she had the apartment I arranged for her, she had the books and French literature, all kinds of things. She was so proud of it -- after being a maid, you know, when we came to Florida. And the work she had in Boduen, she could see Irene every day. And I got reports from her about Irene. But one day, in the beginning, I wanted to see Irene. So I started to walk there. It wasn\u2122t too far from me, it was far enough but not too bad. I could walk then have to take the train which I was avoiding. And the children were going from one side of the street to the other to play with the garden. And I knew from afar, I could see Irene. And one day I decided to go to her, to pick up her hand and I said, I\u2122ll help you to cross the street. And she gave her hand and she looked at me and she walked with me and the nun came and she starte d screaming at me, \ufb01You know that you are not allowed to touch our children! You can give them some kind of infection!\ufb02 which is true. It was typhus and syphilis and this kind, so I said, I\u2122m sorry. I never do it again. So I left Irene and I walked away and she said,\ufb02 Mommy!\ufb02 I got scared. I was afraid that the nun heard it but she didn\u2122t. I never went again. She recognized me. It was after a few months. She was crying the first three months, I heard. 02:56:00 Dr. Zachert told me that. At night, she was crying . And then, I have a very sharp instinct, I don\u2122t know how it happens but it is so. I can somehow feel out things. I was cooking something, I was preparing dinner, and I had a dish with peeled potatoes to put into the water, put into the pot. 42 And I was thinking about Irka and I said, \ufb01Irka is very sick.\ufb02 And everything fell down on the floor. I didn\u2122t understand why. So then, I called, I didn\u2122t call, I called Dr. Zachert and I said, \ufb01I have a feeling that Irka is very sick.\ufb02 She said, \ufb01Yes, it\u2122s tr ue. She still has a mark on her leg, she got some kind of infection.\ufb02 And even the priest wanted to come, you know, she was very sick. And then, you know, somehow she got out of it, you know."

            "answer": "It was by pure accident. Halina Ellenbogen was before Madden Sanitarium (ph) a sanitarium for children, for sick children under the auspices of Bund. Madden (ph) was one of the great leaders from the Bund \u0152 really a theoretician of the Bund -- so there was a sanitarium named in his name and during the war. She was there. Pe relka is really her name, Ellenbogen. There was also Boleck Ellenbogen and Anya (ph) Ellenbogen, so it was the family. And after the liquidation of the Madden Sanitarium, in fact, Michal came there and told them one night that they can go out but they didn\u2122t hear; they were on another side of the -- and this was from Warsaw quite a few miles, about 10 or 15 miles. 03:10:05 They had to go by train, and they didn\u2122t hear him, but he went at night . Halina said that she heard him, but they couldn\u2122t come to that point b ecause they were afraid. So they then came to Warsaw, there was one woman also, a teacher, in Madden Sanitarium, which was -- Irene was also young and she took care of her and she came to look for work. And at that time Blanca and Maria were working at the Germans; she pr obably told you. And she came to ask for work. 47 There were Volksdeutscher19 Germans, or German, \ufb01real Germans.\ufb02 And so she, Blanca, was the head maid over the housekeeper, for the Germans, and she looked at her, and she said, \ufb01My name is Geneska (ph),\ufb02 which is a Polish name. So Blanca answered her, \ufb01We have a lot of Geneska\u2122s (ph) like that, you know.\ufb02 And through her, Halina came to Blanca and Maria and, as we were meeting constantly, you know, Sundays we had all off. So we\u2122re meeting in one place, either at Anya (ph) Ellenbogen\u2122s, where she was working, her mistress was going out, so we brought in Blanca and Maria also there. And sometimes we were going there because they could listen to the radio, to the, you know, Germans could have radio, so we could listen to what\u2122s going on. So this is how I got, you know -- we were, I want to tell you, during that time we were meeting, all these friends, and we\u2122re meeting Ma rysia Sevitzka, you know, and just Navel (ph) Halska (ph), who gave us a lot of help, particularly to Michal and Gina and when Gina was sick, they were taking care of her. But this was during the Aryan side, until the Polish uprising in 1944. And during, you know, the Polish uprising --"

It was a basement, something like that \u0152 or maybe a low ground floor apartment. So he slept there, you know. This was his place at that time. And we were meeting either there or other places, sometimes in a coffee shop which he knew was safe to go into a certain room, or whatever. And he was writing a lot, what\u2122s going on, and he was meeting with the leaders from the underground. And there was a special place also from the Bundists, on Sharavial (ph) Street and he was leaving there, the happenings, you know, the events, which he was writing down everyday. And I remember sitting once with some coffee and he was writing, and I said, \ufb01Aren\u2122t you afraid?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01No, this is, you know, we have to leave something. What\u2122s happening now.\ufb02 He, he wrote everyday. He was very, very, you know, historically minded, and to let people know what\u2122s happening.

This was before the 17 th -- it was about the 16th -- of April, it was Irene\u2122s birthday and his, and he called me and he said that he\u2122s going back into the ghetto because they know that they will be coming, the Germans will come and surround the ghetto and the fight will start. And I said at that time, \ufb01Maybe you won\u2122t go.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01I must go.\ufb02 I didn\u2122t say anything anymore. This was it. And he wi shed me, you know, Irene, and all that. It was his birthday, his 30th birthday. And Irene was how much? Two years old. I had a tremendous conflict. For a long, long time, maybe up to now , who knows. But what\u2122s more important. You 20 A person who, for money or favor , betrayed Jews in hiding. 50 cannot judge. We were very important to him, I know that. He left Irene. He felt when she was born, that there\u2122s no other child who is more educated, more intelligent and prettier than she is, so? He was very proud, very proud of her. So this was, you know, we were meeting, and constantly. In different places, we were meeting. And later on, when -- after the Warsaw ghetto uprising -- we started to meet w ith other people, and as I say, it was Blanca and Maria and Anya (ph) Ellenbogen, and Boleck Ellenbogen and Halina Ellenbogen. 03:19:01 Halina is also not her name, but, Pearl is he r name. And Halina was nearby me, over there, she got the job and Anya (ph) was still worki ng as a maid, and Bolek was working in the construction business. So, we, we used to meet. Sometimes we went to Marysia Sawicka\u2122s home and Navel (ph) Halska (ph). And there was a time when Michal was grabbed in the street and going to Treblinka. He was on the train, and he jumped. He jumped from the train and the Germans shoot and it was, it was -- he got it in his leg, the bullet, and he was, he couldn\u2122t walk, but he hid someplace in the field where he jump ed from and the first place he waited until the morning. This was closer to the evening, middle of the morning, something. In the morning, he went to Marysia Sawicka and Navel (ph) Halska (ph), they lived together. And they took him in, of course. Under, underneath, Gestapo lived. They had a big apartment, Gestapo. And there was no toilets there, you know, so they had to carry out everything. But they did it. They were marvelous, they were really marvelous. They he lped a lot, they give such a shelter to many people, particularly to Gina when Gina got sick. Gina got sick and she died, you know, before the Polish uprising. She died in 1942. She felt she had ulcers and she couldn\u2122t function. She was 51 very sick, and I wasn\u2122t the strongest either and a small child, so sh e felt that she had to take care of us. The only way being, and that is knowing what\u2122s the matter, she couldn\u2122t go for an operation. But this was a Polish, you know, hospital. And how much care she\u2013 Michal didn\u2122t tell me. 03:22:01 She talked to me about going for an operati on, I said, \ufb01Never.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Over my dead body you\u2122re going to the hospital because I am afraid they might not give you good care.\ufb02 And Michal did not tell me that she went to the hospital, but I found out that she died in the hospital after the operation. And this was in December, 1942. So another link of the family went."

The director of that, you know, Guzik. He was very well known, he was in the Judenrat; he was personagrata (ph). He said that I can go to France with Irene. The Jews paid thousands and thousands of dollars to get out and they could\u2013. They were all in that Hotel Polski , it was hotel. Whoever paid was in this hotel, the Jews. And I went there twice, I remember, to visi t some people, to find out what it is and how it is; who are going, who paid in and going. And there was a woman, Estusia Lipszyc, her husband was also very famous Bundist and activist and she had a son and a daughter older overseas. And she was going. She paid in because she sold, sh e was a dentist, she sold everything, you know, her cabinet, you know, this, everything. And she had the money and she paid in and she was going. So I came there and she saw me, she says , \ufb01Look, I have two children, I am not afraid; I am going, that I want to be together.\ufb02 And I told her that I had the offer from Guzik, she says, \ufb01Why don\u2122t you take your child and go?!\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I\u2122m scared, I don\u2122t know. I cannot make this kind of decision. Now she is in the orphanage, she is safe. I don\u2122t know what\u2122s going to happen. She is safe now. And the main thing is her sa fety.\ufb02 I went once; I looked around at the people 56 who are going there, they were mostly Jews, so it was dangerous, but I took the risk, I wanted to know. 03:35:04 Then I went the second time, and I remember that I met I think Meed, his brother, I think, went there also. And I think so. I think it was his brot her. And I spoke again and I still, I couldn\u2122t make the decision because Irene was safe. I fe lt. Whether it was true or not, I don\u2122t know, but this is how I felt at that time. And I came back and I had to give an answer because the Guzik had to know the amount of people to get out from Warsaw to France. Vittel, this was the town, Vittel, the famous town, Vittel. And I spoke to Mrs. Rouba and him and they said to me, \ufb01We don\u2122t trust the Germans. If you want to go, go, but we don\u2122t trust them.\ufb02 And this was somehow my point, decision. They helped me to decide not to go and I did a good thing because all the people went to Auschwitz from Hotel Polski. So, how do you know? This is luck. You make a decision, you don\u2122t know right or wrong. And I di dn\u2122t have anybody close to find out, to ask what should I do? But this was my decision. They helped me to do it. And this is how it was. So, then came the -- we met with friends of mine, as I told you, with whom. And it was nice at that time to see somebody friendly. And they were good company, you know, meaning (ph). They in they were -- when the Germans, you know, they were working for the Germans, they had a picture of a Polish \u0152 Zeromski, you know, author, very famous, you can imagine, when we came in there. Then came the Polish uprising. This is 1944 and they came to our building, too. And they took us out, the Rouba family, the whole Rouba family. 57 03:58:00 Mireck, the oldest one, went to fight. With the, you know, w ith the uprising. He was in the uprising. And one of the days, Halina told me, Ha lina Ellenbogen, when they were in the bunkers hiding, they were going from places to places. W ho came there? Mireck. As Halina and I use to come up to meet, to visit me there, Mireck came in and said, \ufb01What are you doing here?\ufb02 She said, \ufb01The same thing as everybody else.\ufb02 He went out and an hour later he brought her sugar, a whole box of sugar. She couldn\u2122t get over it. Then he was killed in the uprising. Mirek was killed, the oldest son. And the mother said, \ufb01G od gave and God took.\ufb02 She was a very religious, you know, Catholic. Then they came to us to take us and she, with her husband, the two children and I went to a camp, to a big, big field where they were selling all kind of vegetables. They were coming from countries and the villages to sell vegetables, a tremendous place. And they took us there, the Ukrainians. They were wild. They wanted to kills us, you know, in that apartment, so she gave them a bottle of vodka a nd they started to drink and we went down. And this we, you know, we joined the other people and we were taken, walking, you know, to that zazielenic,22 it was called. Zazielenic is green, the vegetables were called zazielenic, you know. And it was an open place with tens of thousands of people were there guarded. We were taken to Pruszk\u00f3w. It was a transient camp. There we re factories, not working factories."

            "answer": "Ukrainians, yeah. They were, you know, the same as the -- I don\u2122t kn ow if they were the same people, but they killed the Zacherts, you kn ow -- they came -- this was in our area, over 22 Greens, vegetables (Polish). 58 there. And we were there sleeping there, you know, just on the grass, were the two children. And then they were taken to Pruszk\u00f3w, to the factorie s there. So we had a roof under, but nothing else there. And they said that people with children, who have children, can go out. 03:41:00 Because they were taking people for work to Ge rmany, so with people with children can go out. So we have two children over there. And there\u2122s he and she. But I don\u2122t have a child. So I was there, I saw there a nun with a few children and I ask her whether she can give me a child and an address where I can deliver the child later. A nd this way I will go out. She gave me -- she was grateful that she can get rid of one child at least. She gave me th is child and we all went out and we went to Ro-bus (ph), an old, the next little town from Pruszk\u00f3w . We walked. And we went there and I was with this strange little girl. She was four or five years old. And what do we do now? There is no money, there is nothing. And I don\u2122t know what is going to happen to Irene because everything was being evacuated. I knew that I have to go back and find out what\u2122s happened to Irene, to Pruszk\u00f3w, at least. And I got an address from another convent, meanwhile, I was there a few days. I took the little girl. I brought her to that convent and I went back. I slept in the convent for a whole night, I didn\u2122t know who I am. I said that the parents, so and so and so, you know. And I went back and then I told th e Roubas\u2122, \ufb01I am going to Pruszk\u00f3w. I have to find out what\u2122s happened with Irene.\ufb02 She says, \ufb01Where are you going, where are you going to stay?\ufb02 She had a friend in Pruszk\u00f3w, on Olowkowa, the street in the [Indecipherable] 11, and I got the address from her. 59 03:43:19 And one morning, she says, \ufb01You have no money, you have nothing.\ufb02 I says, \ufb01What can I do, but I have to go.\ufb02 So when they were all sleeping still, I left her a note that I am going to this and this address, that she knows where I am because sh e was worried about me. And I have to know what\u2122s, what\u2122s happening to her. I was hungry, bu t I was walking through fields with the wheat as I was taking out the kernels and I was eating this, and I came to that person, to that family, and I told her that I know Mrs. Rouba. She didn\u2122t know anything, that I am Jewish, you know, and I came that I was, I know them. I didn\u2122t say that I was working there, but I know them. And I met them. And that I was in the Polish uprising and my husband is in Germany, he is working. And my daughter, my child, is in orphanage because we had to do, we had to do something to make a living and she should be safe. Is in the orphanage in, the Polish orphanage, a Catholic orphanage, you know. So everything is kosher. And I starte d to run around to find out, the convent. I found out the convent and I told them the story, I was fighting in the Polish uprising, my husband is in Germany and all the same story. And my child is in the orphanage. Is Boduena coming here? Did you hear anything about Boduen? They said, \ufb01Yes, we know that they are going to be evacuated.\ufb02 So, \ufb01Good. When?\ufb02 \ufb01We don\u2122t know, but leave me your address and I let you know.\ufb02 They were very nice and very kind. So I left them the address, where I was, but I was gone everyday. I did not rely on that. To that Pruszk\u00f3w, to that camp, the big gates where, because it was a factory before that, and the Ge rmans were sending their armies there, you know, arms, and they were pushing me all the time. I wa s going closer, maybe can take a look inside or whatever. I was running. One day, I came over ther e, I was almost the whole day because I was afraid they will come and I wouldn\u2122t know, were they going or whatever. One day, I come in 60 December, they said somebody was standing ther e, \ufb01Boduena orphanage come, came already.\ufb02 So I heard this, I said, \ufb01This is it.\ufb02 I was waiting, I was already further a little bit from the gate. I was afraid that they would catch me there. So I going further down and I see after maybe an hour, one cart came out with children. You know, what\u2122s cart, the Polish peasants have a cart; there\u2122s a board in the center and there is two like other boards, but a little length. And the children were from both sides sitting, the sm all children, you know. And they\u2122re heads were going like that onto the board. There was one cart that came out with a horse, you know, this was, was drawn by a horse. 03:47:00 And Irene wasn\u2122t there. Came another one. Wasn\u2122t there. The third one, I found her. There is one nun there with the children, in the cart. I let them go because I was afraid, near, near the Germans. I let them go and quite a while I wa s running after them on the other side so nobody would, you know, be suspicious. And I -- then I protest up the, the cart. And I said to the nun, \ufb01Here is my little child, I want to take her.\ufb02 She said, \ufb01Take her.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Chodz do mamusi.\ufb02 \ufb01Come to Mommy.\ufb02 She stretched out her hands , you know, and I took her. And I run. This child, a running nose with the diarrhea. I felt her head, I saw that she has fever. I took her home. I took her temperature, it was in Celsius, you know, 40 degrees, which is 104\u00ba Fahrenheit. I didn\u2122t know what to do. I have not a penny to my soul. I don\u2122t know anybody. What do I do? Well, I asked about a doctor. The people I lived with, you know, I was already there about a week, probably. I asked a doctor about a doctor and they gave me a name of a doctor, a Polish doctor. I went there. \ufb01I was in the uprising, my husband is in Germany, my child was in 61 orphanage. I just brought her back, she is sick and she has a lot of fever.\ufb02 So he said bring her. I said, \ufb01I have no money.\ufb02 He sai d, \ufb01Bring her.\ufb02 And when I left to look for the doctor, Irka (ph), Irene said to me, \ufb01Mommy, will you still come b ack?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Yes, I\u2122ll be back.\ufb02 I took the child. He said, \ufb01She has deep bronchitis. She has in fection of all her intestines. You have to give her medication and ground apples and take ground meat, make balls, boil it without anything and give it to her. That\u2122s all.\ufb02 03:50:04 I brought her back and there were a lot of, you know, fruit cartons that sell, so I use to see that apples were on the ground, so one evening I went out and I picked up the apples. I ground them, gave them. I borrowed money from my, from wh ere I lived, I said, \ufb01I\u2122ll sew something for you, I\u2122ll be sewing and I will return it. I will return the money to you.\ufb02 And she gave me and I bought the meat and then, medication, what do I do now? So there was like Kupat-Cholim 23 in Israel. Kasa-chorych24 it was called, and I went there. \ufb01I was in the Polish uprising, my husband is in Germany and my child is very sick, I have no money. Can I get the medication?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Of course you will get it.\ufb02 They gave me the without the money. The doctor didn\u2122t take money; they didn\u2122t take money, I bought it, you know? She came out. She came out from that and she was, she was happy with me. There was a teenager, Halin a, and I was there. There came a time when they needed the papers, the Kennkarte, you know. And she got used to it, you know, Irene, she settled down somehow. Then I needed a Kennkart e, the document, without this, you know, I am nothing. And one winter day, I decided to go for it because I had the birth certificate of the, you 23 Israel\u2122s National Health Organization. 24 Poland\u2122s National Health Service. 62 know, sister of our maid once, what she gave me from the, when I went to the village that, on this basis I could get a Kennkarte, but the risk to go to the official bureau to get a Kennkarte is like to go, you know, on to the guillotine. And this highway, I am in Pruszk\u00f3w and this is in another town. I cannot go by train, I have to walk on the highway. I gave her instructions, I said, \ufb01In case maybe something happens to me, this and this and this.\ufb02 \ufb01What will you do?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I don\u2122t know.\ufb02 \ufb01Nothing will happen to you, go.\ufb02 And I went. 03:53:00 I had no instructions to give, to leave her with anybody, you know? And I go with this highway. It was quite a few miles. And I\u2122m the only one ther e, it\u2122s cold, it\u2122s terribl y cold, I didn\u2122t have any, something too, too warm to wear anyway. And against me walks a woman and she passes me by with, we always started, not to look each ot her in the face, whoever I see, better not. And I see a familiar face but I wasn\u2122t sure, I was afra id. And I go. A few steps further, you know, five or six steps, I turn around, the woman stands and turns around too. I decided to meet her. And we go to each other and who is it? It was Halina Szef ner, who was the professor of my husband\u2122s in a gimnazjum who teach him French, and I knew her. I knew her husband too. He was a journalist. And you can imagine. I had so ma ny pimples on my face because, you know, I didn\u2122t eat right and all that. The first th ing what she did with me, there was a kiosk selling little things, she bought me yeast, to eat it. I get vitamins , you know, for the pimples. She gave me the contacts. She looked like, I say again, like a thousand, like a ton you know, going, beautiful woman. I have a photograph of her. She was so marvelous, really, gray hair, white hair, she looked like a queen. She gave me the contacts of Mirek. 63"

Can you imagine how she looked? Anyway, one day, so I had to contact with her already, and she let them know that I am some place, you know? She let them know because she wa s in contact with them. And one day, I took Irene. 03:55:58 First of all, I had to take her to Boduena. They were taking all the children to big factories of silk, a little for sewing silk, you know, the little things, and the factories. All the children are, if Irene would go there she wouldn\u2122t come out alive, being so sick at that time. I decided to go to tell the director that I took Ire ne because it was her responsibility and I felt at that time, also stupid of me, but it was right to do that, because she would be worried, what happened to Irene, who took her? Because she was told not to, not to give her to anybody. So, I went there to her, this was the first trip I did by train. And I came back. And after I met Halina Szefner, I decided to go to see Mirek Edelman with the whole group. And, because they would give me help, money they would give me, they had money. And I went there, I went to the train and on the way, a mother of my friend who looked like a hu ndred Jews, I made like that [shaking head \ufb01no\ufb02]. I approached her. So we got off and we went to Mirek and Ala, his wife, and there was Sylvia and Antek together. Well, you can imagine th at he saw us. Mirek was with, with the last 64 minute, you know, with Michal.

And then she committed suicide. In 1962, she committed suicide. This was Elza. Irka was at that time in Europe. She didn\u2122 t know, I didn\u2122t want to write to her. She could never forgive me that, but I didn\u2122t want to, I was afraid. I was really afraid. So she found out, not from me, after she came back. It was a pure accident, from so mebody else, not myself. I prepared myself to tell her on the weekend I am home, to be with her. Doesn\u2122t work like that. This was Elza, you know? Because they were goo d friends. Zygmunt was the one who brought back the news about Treblinka, you know. Very active, very active guy. Nice people.
