And the workers came and, and always ask, \u201cCould you give me a good book, something to read?\u201d And when I spoke to the director of the library, he said to me, \u201cRozka, why won\u2019t you write out a list of 100 books so when the people come in and want to take a book out, they could see the list, what they should take.\u201d And I decided to do that. So, I put down a list of 103 books I know exactly, from different categories, categories and countries. And there was the Scandinavian countries and American literature and, of course, Polish literature, French, all kind. Everything in translation, of course, into Polish, not in the original languages. So I put down a list of 103 books, and Russian literature was a very, very modern at the time, to read the Russian, the Russian literature translated into Polish. And I went to Mrs. Dobnow. Erlich. Dobnow was the daughter of the famous historian Dubnow, wrote the history of the Jews. And she was herself a poet. She was writing poetry in still Russian and knew excellent Polish literature -- altogether a very intelligent and very well educated. His two sons were professors, one of Columbia and the one is who passed away and the one is in Yale. And she was there, I made an appointment with her, and I said, \u201cMrs. Dubnow, I want to come and have your opinion,\u201d because I didn\u2019t want to rely on myself, that this is right. So I left with her the list of 100 books and she studied it. Then she, I called her, and she said, \u201cWould you come up? Let\u2019s have a discussion about it.\u201d\u201d And there she accepted the 100 books, but one which was called, Cztowiek Zmienia S\u2019ku\u2019re.'!

She was a Bundist, but she didn\u2019t want to start with the Communists. This was my feeling at that time, as young as I was. And I felt it should be there. And we had a big discussion about it. And she told me, \"If you feel so strongly about it, let\u2019s leave it.\u201d It was written by Bruno Jasienski, who was a Communist once and he -- who believed in Christ that have to help people and so on. The funniest this was when I came to the United States, and I came to visit her, so she says to me, \u201cIf you feel so strongly about it, let's leave it.\u201d The funniest thing was when I came to the United States and I came to visit her. So she says to me, \u201cRozka, I remember how you argued with me about that book, that we had the discussion about that book.\u201d I was beside myself. How could she remember such a stupid thing and the khutspe\u2019\u201d of me, you know, to argue with her when she says let's take it out.

            "answer": "Not exactly, not exactly. I knew that he is involved, but not exactly, he didn't tell me, you know. So over there, how -- it was interesting. They loved Irene, the little baby and whenever -- he sometimes took her on his knee -- the -- the peasant, Mr. Patoka took -- took her on her knee and they were eating like, potato balls, you know, made. Take matzo balls, you know potato balls. So he took a piece into his mouth, he made it soft and gave it to her. I was looking at it and I was dying, you know. But, didn't say a word about it. There was a little wooden thing for them to give food to the -- to the pigs, they brought it in. So I washed it, I put in water and I bathed Irene. I took her to the fields and I -- I could pick the, what's called? Peas, the green peas in this, I took it out and I gave it. I took carrots, I-I grated them, I squeezed out juice to have for her, the juice the -- the -- the you know, the carrot juice, some vitamins. And when the -- the woman, the peasant, she saw this, she says, \u201cWe give it to the pigs, why do you give it to the baby?\u201d You know, this kind of things, very primitive, but kind. And I think that the soltys, you know what's the soltis, the eldest of the village, who was getting on everything, I think that he guessed who I am, but he never said anything. But one day, he came and he said, \u201c\u201cThe Germans are coming for the boys and girls. It would be good for you to escape here from here with the child. I think I wrote about it, you read it. Michal isn't here, I have no address for Michal. He was one right here, one right there, didn't know what to do. I had a few, you know, Polish zlotys, but didn't know what to do and I had to go, because if he came to me and said it in a nice way, that he didn't want me, you know, to -- he knew that I wouldn't survive with the child. He said I have to disappear, I have to disappear. And he said, that peasant said there is a brother of the -- his wife in -- near Tuszcz. Tuszcz 1s -- was the station where the train stopped for Treblinka, you know. Tuszcz, Malkinia and Treblinka, this was the -- the route. \u201cHe's a smith (ph), you know and so we can take you there. And maybe until your husband will come, he'll find you.\u201d Well, it was quite a few miles. I was carrying Irene you know, with the rest of my, of my strengths. He was carrying a little package what I had, you know, diapers, this. And we came there. Well, they were very nice to us because, you know, he says my husband should come, you know and they'll take me away, it's only a matter of a few days. So she was very nice. But somebody pass by from the village where I was before, in the Gleb- Gleboczyce, who said, \u201cShe was there, why is she here? She is probably Jewish.\u201d This was it. So she came in, the wife and said, \u201cYou cannot stay here any more. You have to go.\u201d And then I decided to go to Warsaw. What do I do? I don't know where, no address, no nothing. And Michal wouldn't know where I am. So I said, \u201cOkay, tomorrow I'll go. You'll take me there to the station and I'll go.\u201d So then I put Irene to sleep for a nap before the trip. Trip supposed to be one o'clock, two o'clock, I don't remember. And she slept and I was standing at the window and I was crying. And suddenly I see somebody passing by. Michal. And I started to run after him, until I came out. He was very fast walking, he didn't know anything, you know. And -- and he didn't hear me, and he didn't hear me screaming, \u201cMichal.\u201d So I took a stone, I threw at him. So then he turned around, said, \u201cWhat you doing here?\u201d And I told him the whole story. This was a miracle, complete miracle. So he came into the apartment and then the -- when the smith (ph), you know, he said, you know, was talking to him and just looking him up and down and he said, \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d And he says, \u201cOh, I am a mechanic, you know, this, that.\u201d So he looks at his hand and said, \u201c\u201cYou are not a mechanic. Doesn't look like it.\u201d And we left. I with Michal, we left. And he took me to pref -- you know, we're afraid of the train, you know. People were -- this was a station where everybody was running here and there. So he took me there, he took me to Warsaw, we took a -- a carriage, you know, a -- s-same is standing in Central Park. And we got off about two blocks before it's destination, which was a very old -- she was a concierge, that woman and the -- for that building where he took me. And this was a very narrow, little room where there were already three woman living. The -- the owner -- the -- the -- the concierge with a little boy and I come and with Irene and Michal. He found it, somebody told him, but he lived not far away, one block away. He lived there, lived, you know, slept. This was the -- the -- the worker where he -- whom he met in the street, what are you doing, and he gave him -- said threw he can stay with him. He was very nice too, that man. He was helping for awhile and then he changed his mind and started to talk. So we -- we went there and I had the little narrow bed for Irene and myself and we contacted the -- Gina, she was working in Warsaw. And Gina came, you know and what do we do? We cannot stay here, everybody will know. And we decided to separate Irene from us, for her to be safe. Cause we knew that we'll perish, this way, another way. It's impossible to live through the whole thing, impossible. So let Irene stay, you know, at least. And we talked it over with Gina, and Gina said, \u201cT have somebody.\u201d And she said, where she gave her exam for nursing -- which was international -- the Ministry, she had to go through the Ministry of -- of Health and Education, Dr. Zachert. \u201cShe seemed to me a very nice person,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen she -- when she examined me. I'll call her.\u201d She called her, she had already papers and she called her and she said that her -- she want to see her, because she want to -- advice from her. She said, \u201cOf course, come.\u201d A very nice person. And she went up and when she told her over the phone that she's on the Juzwiak. So she said, \u201cYou are not Juzwiak. You are a Gina Klepfisz. Please come in.\u201d And she told her the story, she has a brother and a sister-in-law and a baby and sad situation, what can we do? She was also the director of the orphanage, Boduena. Priest Boduen was called. She says, \u201cI can take the baby to the orphanage as an orphan, but not knowing that she's an orphan and she has to be left in the street and I'll take her over.\u201d And here starts the whole thing.

Just leave her and go away and she'll pick her up. So I said to Michal, \u201cI'm not going to do that, I can't. You have to do it.\u201d And Gina was also there, in the square, someplace without Dr. Zachert. So he said, \u201cOkay,\u201d he has to do it. Well, I said good-bye to Irene, he took her and left.

And she could sing, you know, with what we're singing, you know, the melodies. And the words, sometimes. Then Gina asked Dr. Sachat what's going to happen to me?

And they have to look at her, how she looks.\u201d My eyes were already prominent at that time. You'll see another picture of me before that, was because of thyroid. Again, I immediately knew what it is, you know, when I got up in the morning and my eyes were prominent. Never had this kind of eyes. So I went there, was there three times, interview. Meanwhile, before that I was in that room, where I lived, you know, where I be -- came from, with all these women. They were prostitute and they had all her -- their business in the streets. They came in the middle of the night, or whatever. I didn't know about it. I wouldn't even think about 1t, Michal didn't know about it. And one evening was very -- what -- was very rainy, you know and they couldn't do their business in the street, so they invited two -- two men, you know. And there was like a curtain over their bed and I was sitting there and reading, what do I do? I was reading something. Someone said, \u201cWhy can't she give?\u201d \u201cLeave her alone, she has a husband.\u201d \u201cSo, what's this?\u201d But [indecipherable] have to go. So I told them that next time, that when they have some guests in their house, to let me know and I will go out. And they did it one day, it was very cold or something like that. And they said to me, \u201cTake only five, 10 minutes, can come back, but don't go around.\u201d They were very good people, very good women, really. They loved Irene. She didn't cry at night, you know, all the time. So they told me to go and I went out and I was walking around the block, it was evening, around the blocks, I wasn't afraid that somebody can catch me. And I was walking probably for a half an hour or more, even. And then I hear somebody grabs me. It was one of the -- said, \u201cWhat do you think, going in such a cold time, all around? Why don't you come back? I told you take only five, 10 minutes, that's all. You -- you can get, you know, a pneumonia or something like that, come in.\u201d This were the women. Then when -- also when I gave away the baby, you know, when I said it's going to my cousin, Hearanther (ph) says, \u201cWhy did you do that? We could take care of her if you wouldn't, you know.\u201d And we said, \u201cI'm going to work, he is going to work,\u201d you know, if a Jew wouldn't be able to take it, \u201cWe would take care of them.\u201d They were good women. And they loved Irene, you know, because she didn't cry, they were afraid in the beginning that, who knows, the baby will cry, but -- so this was the story before I went for the interviews."

When he used to leave the house, he used come, \u201cPani Lodziu, may I go?\u201d You know, this way. He was very nice. And the children, the two younger children, she was going once a week to another town, where she had an uncle, a priest, Lowicz, to Lowicz, and bring food. Sour cream, butter, cheeses, you know, all kind of things. A lot of it, he'd start to prepare for her when she's coming and she could sell to the neighbors, because we couldn't get it. And she didn't take much money. Before that, she had herself, what she made from them, she could pay for her own, to have for the family. So she was free to go for a few days, for two days, three days, because I took care of the family, you know. So it was a double thing. And not to make me feel bad, she was paying me 80 zlotys a month that I\u2019m working for it, not that I\u2019m giving, you know, her this. Through her I had a telephone there, Michal could call me. And I had a lot of contacts. Over there was living one woman and also she was a teacher and she was very -- and she probably guessed, we never talked about it, but I\u2019m sure she guessed who I am. What I am, you know, who I am. I found '7 Mrs. (Polish). '8 TD card (German). another one, also a friend of hers and that woman, where I could put my friend, Halinka Ellenbogen. She was also a maid someplace. She was always with swollen knees because she was on the floor, you know, washing the floors. I never did this kind of thing. And she was crying and this and that, but she looked very well, you know, like really Aryan. She used to come up to me and I gave her a place to live not far from me. She was also a teacher. And she had, and then I gave her the place with Dr. Zachert in Boduen, so she saw Irene every day. And so she had the apartment I arranged for her, she had the books and French literature, all kinds of things. She was so proud of it -- after being a maid, you know, when we came to Florida. And the work she had in Boduen, she could see Irene every day. And I got reports from her about Irene. But one day, in the beginning, I wanted to see Irene. So I started to walk there. It wasn\u2019t too far from me, it was far enough but not too bad. I could walk then have to take the train which I was avoiding. And the children were going from one side of the street to the other to play with the garden. And I knew from afar, I could see Irene. And one day I decided to go to her, to pick up her hand and I said, P\u2019ll help you to cross the street. And she gave her hand and she looked at me and she walked with me and the nun came and she started screaming at me, \u201cYou know that you are not allowed to touch our children! You can give them some kind of infection!\u201d which is true. It was typhus and syphilis and this kind, so I said, I\u2019m sorry. I never do it again. So I left Irene and I walked away and she said,\u201d Mommy!\u201d I got scared. I was afraid that the nun heard it but she didn\u2019t. I never went again. She recognized me. It was after a few months. She was crying the first three months, I heard. Dr. Zachert told me that. At night, she was crying. And then, I have a very sharp instinct, I don\u2019t know how it happens but it is so. I can somehow feel out things. I was cooking something, I was preparing dinner, and I had a dish with peeled potatoes to put into the water, put into the pot. And I was thinking about Irka and I said, \u201cIrka is very sick.\u201d And everything fell down on the floor. I didn\u2019t understand why. So then, I called, I didn\u2019t call, I called Dr. Zachert and I said, \u201cI have a feeling that Irka is very sick.\u201d She said, \u201cYes, it\u2019s true. She still has a mark on her leg, she got some kind of infection.\u201d And even the priest wanted to come, you know, she was very sick. And then, you know, somehow she got out of it, you know."

And we decided to buy milk, fresh milk, as she, you know, was selling a lot of things to have money for everyday, and so on. We took, we went the first time, I went and bought milk and she asked me, \u201cWhich cow do you want?\u201d To me they looked all the same, but I said, \u201cThis cow.\u201d So she gave me milk from this cow and from then on, I was always buying from the same cow the milk because I was afraid maybe another cow could get sick or something will happen to her and then it will be a reflection on Irene.

And she was giving to her, I gave it to her and she was giving very quietly to Irene, I know, something special. But when he went there, she was screaming at him, she said to never show up again. Because it was very dangerous for the child. Nobody should know, only the director of the orphanage knew, the woman, that she is a Jewish child, and I can -- only the mother -- can pick her up. This was her restriction, Dr. Zachert\u2019s, when Irene came to the orphanage. She said only I can pick her up and not to give the child to anybody because people adopt, you know how it is, she looked as a very Aryan child. She was blonde.

            "answer": "It was by pure accident. Halina Ellenbogen was before Madden Sanitarium (ph) a sanitarrum for children, for sick children under the auspices of Bund. Madden (ph) was one of the great leaders from the Bund \u2014 really a theoretician of the Bund -- so there was a sanitarium named in his name and during the war. She was there. Perelka is really her name, Ellenbogen. There was also Boleck Ellenbogen and Anya (ph) Ellenbogen, so it was the family. And after the liquidation of the Madden Sanitarium, in fact, Michal came there and told them one night that they can go out but they didn\u2019t hear; they were on another side of the -- and this was from Warsaw quite a few miles, about 10 or 15 miles. They had to go by train, and they didn\u2019t hear him, but he went at night. Halina said that she heard him, but they couldn\u2019t come to that point because they were afraid. So they then came to Warsaw, there was one woman also, a teacher, in Madden Sanitartum, which was -- Irene was also young and she took care of her and she came to look for work. And at that time Blanca and Maria were working at the Germans; she probably told you. And she came to ask for work. There were Volksdeutscher!? Germans, or German, \u201creal Germans.\u201d And so she, Blanca, was the head maid over the housekeeper, for the Germans, and she looked at her, and she said, \u201cMy name is Geneska (ph),\u201d which is a Polish name. So Blanca answered her, \u201cWe have a lot of Geneska\u2019s (ph) like that, you know.\u201d And through her, Halina came to Blanca and Maria and, as we were meeting constantly, you know, Sundays we had all off. So we\u2019re meeting in one place, either at Anya (ph) Ellenbogen\u2019s, where she was working, her mistress was going out, so we brought in Blanca and Maria also there. And sometimes we were going there because they could listen to the radio, to the, you know, Germans could have radio, so we could listen to what\u2019s going on. So this is how I got, you know -- we were, I want to tell you, during that time we were meeting, all these friends, and we\u2019re meeting Marysia Sevitzka, you know, and just Navel (ph) Halska (ph), who gave us a lot of help, particularly to Michal and Gina and when Gina was sick, they were taking care of her. But this was during the Aryan side, until the Polish uprising in 1944. And during, you know, the Polish uprising --"

We were meeting and let\u2019s say, sometimes I was staying there overnight, too, that worker who met him in the street and said, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He gave him a shelter then. It was a basement, something like that \u2014 or maybe a low ground floor apartment. So he slept there, you know. This was his place at that time. And we were meeting either there or other places, sometimes in a coffee shop which he knew was safe to go into a certain room, or whatever. And he was writing a lot, what\u2019s going on, and he was meeting with the leaders from the underground. And there was a special place also from the Bundists, on Sharavial (ph) Street and he was leaving there, the happenings, you know, the events, which he was writing down everyday. And I remember sitting once with some coffee and he was writing, and I said, \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, this is, you know, we have to leave something. What\u2019s happening now.\u201d He, he wrote everyday. He was very, very, you know, historically minded, and to let people know what\u2019s happening. So we were meeting, I would say once a week for sure, when Mrs. Rouba saw that I am very depressed or something, she says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and meet your husband,\u201d because whenever I come back from these meetings, you know, I was elated.

This was before the 17\" -- it was about the 16\" -- of April, it was Irene\u2019s birthday and his, and he called me and he said that he\u2019s going back into the ghetto because they know that they will be coming, the Germans will come and surround the ghetto and the fight will start. And I said at that time, \u201cMaybe you won\u2019t go.\u201d He said, \u201cI must go.\u201d I didn\u2019t say anything anymore. This was it. And he wished me, you know, Irene, and all that. It was his birthday, his 30\" birthday. And Irene was how much? Two years old. I had a tremendous conflict. For a long, long time, maybe up to now, who knows. But what\u2019s more important. You *0 A person who, for money or favor, betrayed Jews in hiding. cannot judge. We were very important to him, I know that. He left Irene. He felt when she was born, that there\u2019s no other child who is more educated, more intelligent and prettier than she is, so? He was very proud, very proud of her. So this was, you know, we were meeting, and constantly. In different places, we were meeting. And later on, when -- after the Warsaw ghetto uprising -- we started to meet with other people, and as I say, it was Blanca and Maria and Anya (ph) Ellenbogen, and Boleck Ellenbogen and Halina Ellenbogen. Halina is also not her name, but, Pearl is her name. And Halina was nearby me, over there, she got the job and Anya (ph) was still working as a maid, and Bolek was working in the construction business. So, we, we used to meet. Sometimes we went to Marysia Sawicka\u2019s home and Navel (ph) Halska (ph). And there was a time when Michal was grabbed in the street and going to Treblinka. He was on the train, and he jumped. He jumped from the train and the Germans shoot and it was, it was -- he got it in his leg, the bullet, and he was, he couldn\u2019t walk, but he hid someplace in the field where he jumped from and the first place he waited until the morning. This was closer to the evening, middle of the morning, something. In the morning, he went to Marysia Sawicka and Navel (ph) Halska (ph), they lived together. And they took him in, of course. Under, underneath, Gestapo lived. They had a big apartment, Gestapo. And there was no toilets there, you know, so they had to carry out everything. But they did it. They were marvelous, they were really marvelous. They helped a lot, they give such a shelter to many people, particularly to Gina when Gina got sick. Gina got sick and she died, you know, before the Polish uprising. She died in 1942. She felt she had ulcers and she couldn\u2019t function. She was very sick, and I wasn\u2019t the strongest either and a small child, so she felt that she had to take care of us. The only way being, and that is knowing what\u2019s the matter, she couldn\u2019t go for an operation. But this was a Polish, you know, hospital. And how much care she...Michal didn\u2019t tell me. She talked to me about going for an operation, I said, \u201cNever.\u201d I said, \u201cOver my dead body you\u2019re going to the hospital because I am afraid they might not give you good care.\u201d And Michal did not tell me that she went to the hospital, but I found out that she died in the hospital after the operation. And this was in December, 1942. So another link of the family went."

And I was picking it up someplace, on certain street, for the whole building. It was a co-op building for the engineers, architects, engineers, and they were all, you know, patriots, Polish patriots. Only the concierge\u2019 was a little shaky for me. And he didn\u2019t know, if he would know, I wouldn\u2019t be, you know, there. If he would guess even, I wouldn\u2019t be, he would finish with me, to get some money from Gestapo. And Michal was still alive and I was, I had a dream. I woke up and I was all wet. I dreamt that I see in that bulletin, I see a news item about \u201cMichal Klepfisz, engineer, was caught while making arms\u2019, you know, and was, and he was killed, something like that. And I remember it was page three; one, two, you know \u2014 the first page, the number three -- and I couldn\u2019t believe it.

It was the end of the year, I don\u2019t remember which month, it was the same news item! And he was awarded. It was the medal of Virtuti Militari, the only medal given, you know, to a Jew at the time of the Nazi occupation. How would this happen, I don\u2019t know, but this is a fact.

The director of that, you know, Guzik. He was very well known, he was in the Judenrat; he was personagrata (ph). He said that I can go to France with Irene. The Jews paid thousands and thousands of dollars to get out and they could.... They were all in that Hotel Polski, it was hotel. Whoever paid was in this hotel, the Jews. And I went there twice, I remember, to visit some people, to find out what it is and how it is; who are going, who paid in and going. And there was a woman, Estusia Lipszyc, her husband was also very famous Bundist and activist and she had a son and a daughter older overseas. And she was going. She paid in because she sold, she was a dentist, she sold everything, you know, her cabinet, you know, this, everything. And she had the money and she paid in and she was going. So I came there and she saw me, she says, \u201cLook, I have two children, I am not afraid; I am going, that I want to be together.\u201d And I told her that I had the offer from Guzik, she says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take your child and go?!\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m scared, I don\u2019t know. I cannot make this kind of decision. Now she 1s in the orphanage, she is safe. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. She is safe now. And the main thing 1s her safety.\u201d I went once; I looked around at the people who are going there, they were mostly Jews, so it was dangerous, but I took the risk, I wanted to know. Then I went the second time, and I remember that I met I think Meed, his brother, I think, went there also. And I think so. I think it was his brother. And I spoke again and I still, I couldn\u2019t make the decision because Irene was safe. I felt. Whether it was true or not, I don\u2019t know, but this is how I felt at that time. And I came back and I had to give an answer because the Guzik had to know the amount of people to get out from Warsaw to France. Vittel, this was the town, Vittel, the famous town, Vittel. And I spoke to Mrs. Rouba and him and they said to me, \u201cWe don\u2019t trust the Germans. If you want to go, go, but we don\u2019t trust them.\u201d And this was somehow my point, decision. They helped me to decide not to go and I did a good thing because all the people went to Auschwitz from Hotel Polski. So, how do you know? This is luck. You make a decision, you don\u2019t know right or wrong. And I didn\u2019t have anybody close to find out, to ask what should I do? But this was my decision. They helped me to do it. And this is how it was. So, then came the -- we met with friends of mine, as I told you, with whom. And it was nice at that time to see somebody friendly. And they were good company, you know, meaning (ph). They in they were -- when the Germans, you know, they were working for the Germans, they had a picture of a Polish \u2014 Zeromski, you know, author, very famous, you can imagine, when we came in there. Then came the Polish uprising. This 1s 1944 and they came to our building, too. And they took us out, the Rouba family, the whole Rouba family. Mireck, the oldest one, went to fight. With the, you know, with the uprising. He was in the uprising. And one of the days, Halina told me, Halina Ellenbogen, when they were in the bunkers hiding, they were going from places to places. Who came there? Mireck. As Halina and I use to come up to meet, to visit me there, Mireck came in and said, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She said, \u201cThe same thing as everybody else.\u201d He went out and an hour later he brought her sugar, a whole box of sugar. She couldn\u2019t get over it. Then he was killed in the uprising. Mirek was killed, the oldest son. And the mother said, \u201cGod gave and God took.\u201d She was a very religious, you know, Catholic. Then they came to us to take us and she, with her husband, the two children and I went to a camp, to a big, big field where they were selling all kind of vegetables. They were coming from countries and the villages to sell vegetables, a tremendous place. And they took us there, the Ukrainians. They were wild. They wanted to kills us, you know, in that apartment, so she gave them a bottle of vodka and they started to drink and we went down. And this we, you know, we joined the other people and we were taken, walking, you know, to that zazielenic,\u201d~ it was called. Zazielenic is green, the vegetables were called zazielenic, you know. And it was an open place with tens of thousands of people were there guarded. We were taken to Pruszkow. It was a transient camp. There were factories, not working factories."

And we were there sleeping there, you know, just on the grass, were the two children. And then they were taken to Pruszkow, to the factories there. So we had a roof under, but nothing else there. And they said that people with children, who have children, can go out. Because they were taking people for work to Germany, so with people with children can go out. So we have two children over there. And there\u2019s he and she. But I don\u2019t have a child. So I was there, I saw there a nun with a few children and I ask her whether she can give me a child and an address where I can deliver the child later. And this way I will go out. She gave me -- she was grateful that she can get rid of one child at least. She gave me this child and we all went out and we went to Ro-bus (ph), an old, the next little town from Pruszkow . We walked. And we went there and I was with this strange little girl. She was four or five years old. And what do we do now\u201d There is no money, there is nothing. And I don\u2019t know what is going to happen to Irene because everything was being evacuated. I knew that I have to go back and find out what\u2019s happened to Irene, to Pruszkow, at least. And I got an address from another convent, meanwhile, I was there a few days. I took the little girl. I brought her to that convent and I went back. I slept in the convent for a whole night, I didn\u2019t know who I am. I said that the parents, so and so and so, you know.

I have to find out what\u2019s happened with Irene.\u201d She says, \u201cWhere are you going, where are you going to stay?\u201d She had a friend in Pruszkow, on Olowkowa, the street in the [Indecipherable] 11, and I got the address from her. And one morning, she says, \u201cYou have no money, you have nothing.\u201d I says, \u201cWhat can I do, but I have to go.\u201d So when they were all sleeping still, I left her a note that I am going to this and this address, that she knows where I am because she was worried about me. And I have to know what\u2019s, what\u2019s happening to her. I was hungry, but I was walking through fields with the wheat as I was taking out the kernels and I was eating this, and I came to that person, to that family, and I told her that I know Mrs. Rouba. She didn\u2019t know anything, that I am Jewish, you know, and I came that I was, I know them. I didn\u2019t say that I was working there, but I know them. And I met them. And that I was in the Polish uprising and my husband is in Germany, he 1s working. And my daughter, my child, is in orphanage because we had to do, we had to do something to make a living and she should be safe. Is in the orphanage in, the Polish orphanage, a Catholic orphanage, you know. So everything is kosher. And I started to run around to find out, the convent. I found out the convent and I told them the story, I was fighting in the Polish uprising, my husband 1s in Germany and all the same story. And my child 1s in the orphanage. Is Boduena coming here? Did you hear anything about Boduen? They said, \u201cYes, we know that they are going to be evacuated.\u201d So, \u201cGood. When?\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know, but leave me your address and I let you know.\u201d They were very nice and very kind. So I left them the address, where I was, but I was gone everyday. I did not rely on that. To that Pruszkow, to that camp, the big gates where, because it was a factory before that, and the Germans were sending their armies there, you know, arms, and they were pushing me all the time. I was going closer, maybe can take a look inside or whatever. I was running. One day, I came over there, I was almost the whole day because I was afraid they will come and I wouldn\u2019t know, were they going or whatever. One day, I come in December, they said somebody was standing there, \u201cBoduena orphanage come, came already.\u201d So I heard this, I said, \u201cThis is it.\u201d I was waiting, I was already further a little bit from the gate. I was afraid that they would catch me there. So I going further down and I see after maybe an hour, one cart came out with children. You know, what\u2019s cart, the Polish peasants have a cart; there\u2019s a board in the center and there is two like other boards, but a little length. And the children were from both sides sitting, the small children, you know. And they\u2019re heads were going like that onto the board. There was one cart that came out with a horse, you know, this was, was drawn by a horse. And Irene wasn\u2019t there. Came another one. Wasn\u2019t there. The third one, I found her. There is one nun there with the children, in the cart. I let them go because I was afraid, near, near the Germans. I let them go and quite a while I was running after them on the other side so nobody would, you know, be suspicious. And I -- then I protest up the, the cart. And I said to the nun, \u201cHere is my little child, I want to take her.\u201d She said, \u201cTake her.\u201d I said, \u201cChodz do mamusi.\u201d \u201cCome to Mommy.\u201d She stretched out her hands, you know, and I took her. And I run. This child, a running nose with the diarrhea. I felt her head, I saw that she has fever. I took her home. I took her temperature, it was in Celsius, you know, 40 degrees, which is 104\u00b0 Fahrenheit. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I have not a penny to my soul. I don\u2019t know anybody. What do I do? Well, I asked about a doctor. The people I lived with, you know, I was already there about a week, probably. I asked a doctor about a doctor and they gave me a name of a doctor, a Polish doctor. I went there. \u201cI was in the uprising, my husband 1s in Germany, my child was in orphanage. I just brought her back, she is sick and she has a lot of fever.\u201d So he said bring her. I said, \u201cI have no money.\u201d He said, \u201cBring her.\u201d And when I left to look for the doctor, Irka (ph), Irene said to me, \u201cMommy, will you still come back?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d I took the child. He said, \u201cShe has deep bronchitis. She has infection of all her intestines. You have to give her medication and ground apples and take ground meat, make balls, boil it without anything and give it to her. That\u2019s all.\u201d I brought her back and there were a lot of, you know, fruit cartons that sell, so I use to see that apples were on the ground, so one evening I went out and I picked up the apples. I ground them, gave them. I borrowed money from my, from where I lived, I said, \u201cIll sew something for you, Pll be sewing and I will return it. I will return the money to you.\u201d And she gave me and I bought the meat and then, medication, what do I do now? So there was like Kupat-Cholim\u201d? in Israel. Kasa-chorych\u201d* it was called, and I went there. \u201cI was in the Polish uprising, my husband is in Germany and my child is very sick, I have no money. Can I get the medication?\u201d He said, \u201cOf course you will get it.\u201d They gave me the without the money. The doctor didn\u2019t take money; they didn\u2019t take money, I bought it, you know? She came out. She came out from that and she was, she was happy with me. There was a teenager, Halina, and I was there. There came a time when they needed the papers, the Kennkarte, you know. And she got used to it, you know, Irene, she settled down somehow. Then I needed a Kennkarte, the document, without this, you know, I am nothing. And one winter day, I decided to go for it because I had the birth certificate of the, you *3 Israel\u2019s National Health Organization. ** Poland\u2019s National Health Service. know, sister of our maid once, what she gave me from the, when I went to the village that, on this basis I could get a Kennkarte, but the risk to go to the official bureau to get a Kennkarte is like to go, you know, on to the guillotine. And this highway, I am in Pruszkow and this 1s in another town. I cannot go by train, I have to walk on the highway. I gave her instructions, I said, \u201cIn case maybe something happens to me, this and this and this.\u201d \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cNothing will happen to you, go.\u201d And I went. I had no instructions to give, to leave her with anybody, you know? And I go with this highway. It was quite a few miles. And I\u2019m the only one there, it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s terribly cold, I didn\u2019t have any, something too, too warm to wear anyway. And against me walks a woman and she passes me by with, we always started, not to look each other in the face, whoever I see, better not. And I see a familiar face but I wasn\u2019t sure, I was afraid. And I go. A few steps further, you know, five or six steps, I turn around, the woman stands and turns around too. I decided to meet her. And we go to each other and who 1s it? It was Halina Szefner, who was the professor of my husband\u2019s in a gimnazjum who teach him French, and I knew her. I knew her husband too. He was a journalist. And you can imagine. I had so many pimples on my face because, you know, I didn\u2019t eat right and all that. The first thing what she did with me, there was a kiosk selling little things, she bought me yeast, to eat it. I get vitamins, you know, for the pimples. She gave me the contacts. She looked like, I say again, like a thousand, like a ton you know, going, beautiful woman. I have a photograph of her. She was so marvelous, really, gray hair, white hair, she looked like a queen. She gave me the contacts of Mirek."

Can you imagine how she looked? Anyway, one day, so I had to contact with her already, and she let them know that I am some place, you know? She let them know because she was in contact with them. And one day, I took Irene. First of all, I had to take her to Boduena. They were taking all the children to big factories of silk, a little for sewing silk, you know, the little things, and the factories. All the children are, if Irene would go there she wouldn\u2019t come out alive, being so sick at that time. I decided to go to tell the director that I took Irene because it was her responsibility and I felt at that time, also stupid of me, but it was right to do that, because she would be worried, what happened to Irene, who took her? Because she was told not to, not to give her to anybody. So, I went there to her, this was the first trip I did by train. And I came back. And after I met Halina Szefner, I decided to go to see Mirek Edelman with the whole group. And, because they would give me help, money they would give me, they had money.

She was born in 1936, was Elza. And whoever lived through will take care of the other wife and the children. This was their pact. And Frydrych told me about it. Frydrych told me about it, yeah. It was after, when I met him, when I already knew about, what Vladka told me, you know, and both of them, when Frydrych was killed taking out people from the canals, after the Warsaw ghetto uprising, there was a certain village and they were caught and there were five people were killed at that time and he was among them. And his wife perished in Majdanek, she was taken before that. And Elza was with Polish people and she was first in a convent, and then, you know, Mirek Edelman and a whole group were just following. Elza stayed in the convent, and then after the Polish uprising, she was shifted to another place. There were a few places and she was sick and tired of it. She was a young child, very bright, intelligent, beautiful. And in the end she settled, you know, they gave her to a Smith (ph) and they loved her and they really wanted her and she felt good with them. And all the time, you know, changing places and loosing her security. She was very angry and bitter about that. And after the war, when they came for her, Mirek Edelman came with his wife, Ala, to take her away from that Polish family, she didn\u2019t want to go because her parents told her, \u201cRemember, never tell anybody that you are Jewish.\u201d And she didn\u2019t know after the war, after the war ended, she didn\u2019t know anything, and the woman didn\u2019t want to give her away. She wanted to have her as her child, as a child of her own and so they gave her a lot of money and this way, they took Elza. And then it started the whole thing again, you know, from place to place. I was for her a mother. She loved Irene and the pact was following me, to take care of Elza. And there is a family here, Shatzkin, who adopted her. She had a tragic life she couldn\u2019t shed. Nervous breakdowns. And she always was coming to me on the vacation, she was in Cornell when the vacation came. She always visited, not with her parents, adopted parents, but with us, with Irene and me. And they were like siblings, you know. To me she was like a daughter, really. But she had a few nervous breakdowns and, in the end, she went to the hospital. Also, she got married, a professor from Columbia. He\u2019s better known now, a historian. And that Sunday morning when she went to the hospital, she called me up and she said, \u2018\u201cRozka, I am going to meet my father and mother,\u201d because she knew that it will be drilling about her past, her childhood, and this and that. And then she committed suicide. In 1962, she committed suicide. This was Elza. Irka was at that time in Europe. She didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t want to write to her. She could never forgive me that, but I didn\u2019t want to, I was afraid. I was really afraid. So she found out, not from me, after she came back. It was a pure accident, from somebody else, not myself. I prepared myself to tell her on the weekend I am home, to be with her. Doesn\u2019t work like that. This was Elza, you know? Because they were good friends. Zygmunt was the one who brought back the news about Treblinka, you know. Very active, very active guy. Nice people. So little by little, everything was shrinking."

So I was sitting and sewing sometimes to two o\u2019clock at night, three o\u2019clock at night and Irene was sleeping. It was only, you know, two rooms, one bedroom, was there. I was in the bedroom with Irene in one bed, another bed somebody else was sleeping there. And this is how it was."

I didn\u2019t smoke at that time already. And chocolate and sardines and all kinds of things, and it was like, you know, manna from heaven. And I remember, I started to give Irene little by little the goodies, and Halina came so I gave her the cigarettes because she was smoking, heavily smoking. And I gave her all the goodies so Irene was, couldn\u2019t even reach the table but she was looking how Halina was eating, I gave her this and I gave her that, so she asked me, \u201cMommy, will Pani Halina eat everything?\u201d So I said, \u201cNo, there are things for you too, don\u2019t worry.\u201d So this was, you know -- and he came twice with the truck, you know, from Lublin.

There was one train a day and there were thousands, thousands of people so he took me and Irene. He threw Irene through the window, somebody picked her up, then me, he carrying me, pushed also through the window and he somehow got to through a door, I don\u2019t know how. This was the way, this was Mirek, you know? Always caring. This is how people, a whole group of people cared, you know, when they knew somebody 1s, and they picked up Elza as I told you. People cared. Take Boleck, you know, how he came with food and all that. Because, first of all, a child alive at this time was like, you know, a miracle. I was the only mother. There was also Gabrish, you know, Chana Fryshdorf. They were in the partisans. But he was born in a bunker, born in the Polish uprising, and she went out and she also was in that, but this was 1944 already. He was just born then. And she was for a while, the Polish uprising finished, you know, it was -- and for a while she was in a village someplace. He was the -- she looked like, you know, a hundred Jews. And the little one, the babies, nothing. But after a while she came to Lodz to find out, she went to Warsaw and the committee was, addresses and names, she found out to be in L6dz so she came to L\u00e9dz and she found us, Chana Fryshdorf. Her husband was killed in the partisans. He went for a project, you know. They had for the trains to dynamite a train or something and was killed by the Germans and she stayed, you know, pregnant with, there was the child. And she came to Lodz and she found us. She went back. She brought Gaby, he was very sick also. He had some kind, around his ears, some infections all around his neck. And we stayed together since then, you know, this is the way. Gabrish (ph) 1s like a brother to her, to Irka because Irka was the big sister. Another three years older, you know, that\u2019s all. Do you know? We created families. It was like one of us cared about the other, you know? And I had two, two towels I gave her one towel; two apples, I gave her one apple. For Gaby, you know, this is, this is how it was. And we lived together. It was a while in Lodz after the war, we lived together. The Ellenbogens and Chana Fryshdorf and Halinka."

I got some money, very little, but I remember that the Zared (ph) -- this is from the Bundist Committee -- they send me some money at that time and then my family, my aunt, Michal\u2019s aunt from the States, used to send me a few dollars here and there, but it went all to the common, you know, account. That\u2019s all. And this is how we lived there. It was, you know, a family. Boleck used to go with Irene, you know, for walks. We used to do some sewing and at home for somebody.

But this is an example, a child comes up. And then there were constantly killings, they were killing, murders. And we decided to go away at that time. It was antisemitism, it was. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they finish up everybody?\u201d So it wasn\u2019t easy, but to Lodz came a lot of people. The same thing to Warsaw, the survivors looking for the families; they stayed here or there. In all kind, but the atmosphere was very bad. Then we decided, the, the Jacob Patt came to Poland and he said that he can take, give some visas, you know? To Sweden. Sweden was taking in people. And of course, I gave -- I was on the list with Irene because of Michal\u2019s aunt here. But to tell you about the atmosphere, to go by train to Gdynia, this is the port of Poland. There we could take the boat to Sweden. Two women, Polish women, went with us, we with children. It was Chana Fryshdorf, Gaby, and I was with Irene in our, in our train. In case something happens, \u201cThis 1s their children,\u201d because they were taking down people from the trains and killing. So, once came somebody to our apartment with a gun and looking for somebody. Luckily, it was a mistake. You know, Boleck was at that time; I was at that time, Irene was asleep, it was in the evening. To kill somebody because they had some kind of account, who knows? But it was very dangerous. Kielce. You know about Kielce? This was 1946! We left 1946, the first, the 31\u00b0 of March, I think so. So this was very dangerous to live. So we had, it was us, some Polish people to go with us in case the children are not theirs. Always the children and if they take us, okay, but the children are there. So this is how it was, you know, in Poland. *8 Jewess (Polish)."

The children were wonderful there. This is where Irene was going bicycling and swimming and school. She spoke Swedish like a Swedish-born child immediately. She went to school. The people were very nice to us. They always invited me and Irene for coffee and cookies and she was playing with the children then. She spoke. We didn\u2019t never lock the doors at night. When Chana said, \u201cI\u2019m going to buy some milk at the store,\u201d you know country store, and she gave her a little, you know, back with a few Swedish crowns, she said, \u201cWhere is your bag?\u201d A pocket book, Irene had. \u201cOh, I left it on the bench over there.\u201d I said, \u201cGo and pick it up.\u201d She said, \u201cNaw, [ll take it tomorrow.\u201d She found it tomorrow.

And we had a whole group. I was always, I don\u2019t like to live in groups, so we had two buildings. One was a big building with a lot of survivors and we were only three families in this building, you know, where we lived. And it was marvelous. Everybody cared about the other and we could go to the city with Chana and Chana\u2019s brother\u2019s wife took care of the children, to go to sleep, you know, or something like that. We started to work, both. She was a very good children\u2019s dressmaker. So we went to the biggest store in Melbourne, in Melbourne. This is Australia already. I was in Australia for a time.

I couldn\u2019t speak, you know, but I was reading and writing. So this was also, you know, what we did in Sweden. So I came here and I brought Gaby with me, which was a nice thing, on the boat. At that time, in 1949, it was an order from the immigration department that nobody can land in New York, only first have got to Ellis Island. This was order and no, even with visas, not only passing by, cannot go. I didn\u2019t know about it. Nobody told me. Gaby was secured, \u201c\u2018bamaters (ph)\u201d as here, you know? She was legally, you know, here. But I didn\u2019t know about it at all. And during the passage, there was a young woman who really was with me constantly. She was going on a regular, not a legal visa, to her sister here. But she was so, she was from a camp or something, very depressed. But I took her under my wing, so, I said, \u201cYou have to go to the doctors, there was this child, you go first to the doctors.\u201d I gave her one child, she go before me and I went after that. This kind of thing. And her sister was also there when we arrived. They let them come on the boat, you know, aboard.

I wondered why, but I couldn\u2019t talk to her because I was the next one. So, Chana Fryshdorf was there with Bernard Goldstein (ph), was another one, survivor, also. And so, first of all, I clear Gaby. I said, \u201cThe mother is here, she can pick him up,\u201d you know, the mother. And Gaby is through. Then I come and I supposed to go, Gaby shouldn\u2019t have gone to Ellis Island as a child, but all the other passengers with visas, legal visas, had to go to Ellis Island, from Ellis Island they had to release them. Next, I come. So, I give my passport, all these documents for clearing and he said, \u201cNow, you go to Ellis Island.\u201d He talked fast. So I said to him, it was my khutspe, I said, \u201cYou speak very good English but too fast.\u201d He take the stamps, he put \u2018pass\u2019. Can you imagine such a thing? I was the only one with Irene who passed. If I would go to Ellis Island, I wouldn\u2019t be here today, because I only had 10 days and they send everybody out. In transit, I was in transit. But this is what I said, this is what works. My khutspe, I said, \u201cYou speak very good English, but too fast.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what this Ellis Island, I didn\u2019t know what he is talking about. And I got stamped \u2018pass\u2019.

There was a beautiful speech from Dr. Robinson, you know, and I went to the Joint. Then it\u2019s sad that it\u2019s a new era."

I understand how hard it has to be to face the deaths of so many people that are so close to you.

If I would have to tell this story, you know, what really, with what happened all the time it would take, I don\u2019t even know whether I could find the real words to describe. I don\u2019t think we have -- we don\u2019t have the vocabulary, all these words to describe what we lived through. And sometimes I wonder now, and I spoke about it to some friends. I really don\u2019t know from where I took all the strength to get through all these years. I really don\u2019t know. And I cannot understand how I did it. I really can\u2019t understand how I did it. It was by, what kind of force was pushing me to do this or that, to decide, all kinds of things, which came out good decisions, but I don\u2019t know. I really, and to describe the feelings, the life, what we went through, I don\u2019t think there is a real vocabulary that has all the words for it."
