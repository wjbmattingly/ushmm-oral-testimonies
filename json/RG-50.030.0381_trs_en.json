So I left Irene and I walked away and she said,\u201d Mommy!\u201d I got scared. I was afraid that the nun heard it but she didn\u2019t. I never went again. She recognized me. It was after a few months. She was crying the first three months, I heard. 02:56:00 Dr. Zachert told me that. At night, she was crying. And then, I have a very sharp instinct, I don\u2019t know how it happens but it is so. I can somehow feel out things. I was cooking something, I was preparing dinner, and I had a dish with peeled potatoes to put into the water, put into the pot. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They took them to the field during the day, close by, and then, you know, some never went out of the ghetto, too. And that I couldn\u2019t, I was breastfeeding her, but not always I had enough and so once she needed milk. And my doctors, they believed very much in fresh milk so my mother-in-law found out where the cows are. They wasn\u2019t too far from where we lived. And we decided to buy milk, fresh milk, as she, you know, was selling a lot of things to have money for everyday, and so on. We took, we went the first time, I went and bought milk and she asked me, \u201cWhich cow do you want?\u201d To me they looked all the same, but I said, \u201cThis cow.\u201d So she gave me milk from this cow and from then on, I was always buying from the same cow the milk because I was afraid maybe another cow could get sick or something will happen to her and then it will be a reflection on Irene. So we had the milk all the time, whenever I bought, from the same cow."

This was her restriction, Dr. Zachert\u2019s, when Irene came to the orphanage. She said only I can pick her up and not to give the child to anybody because people adopt, you know how it is, she looked as a very Aryan child. She was blonde.

The director of that, you know, Guzik. He was very well known, he was in the Judenrat; he was personagrata (ph). He said that I can go to France with Irene. The Jews paid thousands and thousands of dollars to get out and they could.... They were all in that Hotel Polski, it was hotel. Whoever paid was in this hotel, the Jews. And I went there twice, I remember, to visit some people, to find out what it is and how it is; who are going, who paid in and going. And there was a woman, Estusia Lipszyc, her husband was also very famous Bundist and activist and she had a son and a daughter older overseas. And she was going. She paid in because she sold, she was a dentist, she sold everything, you know, her cabinet, you know, this, everything. And she had the money and she paid in and she was going. So I came there and she saw me, she says, \u201cLook, I have two children, I am not afraid; I am going, that I want to be together.\u201d And I told her that I had the offer from Guzik, she says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take your child and go?!\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m scared, I don\u2019t know. I cannot make this kind of decision. Now she 1s in the orphanage, she is safe. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. She is safe now.

And I think so. I think it was his brother. And I spoke again and I still, I couldn\u2019t make the decision because Irene was safe. I felt. Whether it was true or not, I don\u2019t know, but this is how I felt at that time. And I came back and I had to give an answer because the Guzik had to know the amount of people to get out from Warsaw to France. Vittel, this was the town, Vittel, the famous town, Vittel. And I spoke to Mrs. Rouba and him and they said to me, \u201cWe don\u2019t trust the Germans. If you want to go, go, but we don\u2019t trust them.\u201d And this was somehow my point, decision. They helped me to decide not to go and I did a good thing because all the people went to Auschwitz from Hotel Polski. So, how do you know? This is luck. You make a decision, you don\u2019t know right or wrong. And I didn\u2019t have anybody close to find out, to ask what should I do? But this was my decision. They helped me to do it. And this is how it was. So, then came the -- we met with friends of mine, as I told you, with whom. And it was nice at that time to see somebody friendly. And they were good company, you know, meaning (ph).

This was order and no, even with visas, not only passing by, cannot go. I didn\u2019t know about it. Nobody told me. Gaby was secured, \u201c\u2018bamaters (ph)\u201d as here, you know?

So I said to him, it was my khutspe, I said, \u201cYou speak very good English but too fast.\u201d He take the stamps, he put \u2018pass\u2019. Can you imagine such a thing?
