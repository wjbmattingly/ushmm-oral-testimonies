            "answer": "When I was liberated, it was in June, I don\u2019t know exact the date, 1944. We f -- I remember that when the Russians arrived, they assigned most of the partisans to the army, because the war was still going on. And I and another group and one of the commandeers were assigned to liberate my town and the vicinity of Pruzana. So ra - time when I -- when I came to Pruzana, the most assignments what we were given was to first of all, to s -- look and find most all the collaborators who collaborated with the Germans. This was one of our mission, and then we were sent surrounding towns around Pruzana. I recall one place, it was near -- not far -- 50 kilometers from Pruzana. We went in a little town, I think it was -- let me [indecipherable] the town. Think it was Bielsk, Bielsk. And I remember a farmer came over to me, and he was telling me there is -- this farmer was eding -- hiding out one of the Jewish -- a Jew -- a Jewish boy. And the farmer told me, he says, I been trying to tell him that the war is Over, come out from there. He was in the barn, in a hay barn they\u2019re hiding. And he -- he\u2019s heard -- he didn\u2019t believe him because it was still going on, a lot of bombardments, the Russians, you know, the airplanes, they bombard at the retreating German army. So I remember I went out to him and I says, come out, I\u2019m a Jew, and I spoke to him Yiddish. Finally he came out. Of course, he was all unshaved, dirty and oof -- this 1s -- this is occasion that I can never forget. Then, while being -- eventually, when I settled in Pruzana, I came to my house and the house, a lot of houses were destroyed during the war. My house was still existing there. And I came to my house and there was a family with a lot of children, awful USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0080 : lot of children. And she nice to be to me, nice to me -- she tried to be an -- a Gentile ca -- a Gentile [indecipherable] they tried to nice to me. And she tried to, you know, give me food and I saw they haven\u2019t got much for themselves, they were -- I just asked her a place to stay and sleep because I was still working, I was still in my uniform, was still given a job to look for all those collaborators. And eventually the - another historish -- historic movement -- mo-moment, I would say, after a -- a few weeks or a couple mo -- maybe -- maybe six weeks, showed up in sh -- in Pruzana a doctor, her name is Olla Goldfine, and she was a neighbor of mine. And before the war, you know, I was in y -- you know, listening to these -- to these history what is going on with the Germans, with the Nazis in Germany, and so what I\u2019m [indecipherable] I was only 15 years old that time, I was surprised and she told me -- and she came with a nun, and she told me that she escaped on the second -- this was January the -- I -- I think it was the second transport, January the 28\", 1943, at night from the -- from the cattle car, and she -- sh -- wandered around all night til she reached -- in Pruzana we had nuns -- what is the name? A c -- ac -- you know, it was a house of nuns."

And sh -- one of -- one of the nuns asked them there, the Mother Superior if she can, you know, that -- to accept her there. But she was afraid and she wasn\u2019t, I would say, 1t was a problem for her. So eventually what happened, the nun USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0080 \u00b0 gave her clothes, and put on a big cross on her, and she took off to a town in central Poland, and there she spend most of -- most of the time til, in 1944 when the Russian moved up to near -- near where she was staying, liberated her, and she came back to Pruzana with a nun. Of course, I tried, you know, I was able to do a lot of things that time when I was as-assigned to -- in Pruzana. I helped them very much, and eventually, when I left Pruzana, the nun and the doctor followed me and I brought them out to Poland. The war was still going on and we settled wa -- in Bialystok because Bialystok was already liberated, and Bialystok was assigned the temporary capital of Poland. Coming in Bialystok there were already lot of organizations, like different organization from different -- from different nationalities, from churches, some from -- and they helped, you know, that time to find housing and to settle down temporarily. So, it happened to be my brother, we call him Shmeril, my brother Louis was already in Bialystok.

A few here, you know, the church sponsor, they took them right in. But the church are responsible for them. When they come in they gotta give them. So we had a tough time for two years.
