And then what happened i \u0152 th that was 1947 \u0152 \u212248, the infl \u0152 at that time, the influence of Soviet Russia was tremendous. Why? Because that goes to polit \u0152 politics. The Czechs always felt that the west let them down. Th-The \u0152 the che \u0152 the \u0152 the west means England , not the United States , the United States was out of this world. But England , France , partially Italy , that instead of helping the Czechs, so to speak, maintain their Interview with Frank Hyde May 4, 2013 22 identity, freedom, they let them down, and then in turn, Hitler marched in, and the whole situation has changed. So the Russia influence was very strong. We, Georgine and me, we didn\u2122t care for it, because we have seen what happened when you don\u2122t have freedom. We both survived Auschwitz , we came back in 1945, and were living in Prague as best as we could have done it, until \u212247 - \u212248. But when the situation became very, very difficult, we didn\u2122t like it. We thought again, we might have to go through the same thing. Maybe not the extremes, but hardly the freedom which we were hoping for. Well, we decided to get out of Czechoslovakia , which was 19 four \u0152 late \u212247, early \u212248. I couldn\u2122t get out, because I was, quote, military age. So I thought that if I somehow split with Georgine, that by myself I will be easier to get out than two of us with luggage and all and that stuff. That\u2122s how we thought of it. Well, I met somebody by the name of Hyde . His name was Walter E . Hyde . Through him, I got a English passport. So Georgine left Prague in February 1948. I couldn\u2122t get out that quickly. In the meantime she went from Prague to London , stayed in London for a while. From her mother\u2122s side, they were here, surviving the situation in Ecuador . Now, of the f \u0152 all these countries, I\u2122ll tell you why Ecuador . That was Georgine\u2122s uncle from her mother\u2122s side; he was a dentist. But he didn\u2122t care for dentistry, he was more like a businessman sitting on the board of directors here, sitting on the board of directors there. And somehow he became Interview with Frank Hyde May 4, 2013 23 consul general of Ecuador . Well, how he got Ecuador , I can\u2122t tell you. But that\u2122s how it was. So it was \u0152 unfortunately, the situation became worse, before Hitler and all that stuff. He was trying to convince Georgine\u2122s mother and father to go to Ecuador because he was able to give them the visa to go to Ecuador . Well, my mother, you know, they were in a different situation. They had a house like a house, and those days there were no mortgages in Prague . So to leave your house, to leave your business, that was unheard of. Why should I go to Ecuador to listen to those idiots down there, or something? This is my home. Well, unfortunately, it didn\u2122t work out in the long run, but since they survived in Ecuador , in Quito , they came after the war here, like most of people usually do. So when Georgine was in England , she heard, of course, of her aunt and uncle, that they were here \u0152 they were in Ecuador at that time. But they know they were living in \u0152 in Ecuador . They came here and that uncle of hers had some earlier connections to somebody who was a manufacturing person. And because of the Cold War which existed already at that time, somehow the United States government was pumping much more money into Puerto Rico , as a prevention that Puerto Rico wouldn\u2122t go too much left, like some of the countries did."

Not for u \u0152 I mean, we were just prisoners, and we had to do whatever we were told, but it was not so easy for them either. So we were traveling for two days, eastward. Then we came to a place in Germany , or maybe western Poland , or something. Next to us was a train with German soldiers. They were heading west, we were heading east. It\u2122s like that, okay.
