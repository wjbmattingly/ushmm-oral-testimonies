Baloja(ph) said to the commandeer, him, he\u2122s Jewish, he doesn\u2122t know ho-how to pu t mines. I\u2122m not going. So he says, step away, right away. In Russia there\u2122s not such a thing you\u2122re not going. So he said, who wants to go? And my friend Abrusha (ph), he \u0152 he \u0152 I\u2122m going with Noah.

And that\u2122s what I was missing. All the years I used to say, uh, I have to go to scho ol. School is far. AAfter a day\u2122s walk, we [indecipherable] went by hand to Israel in the hot day, they have \u0152 you have \u0152 the \u0152 you strong enough to go into school twen \u0152 20 kilometer. And you [indecipherable] money for \u0152 to \u0152 to \u0152 to pay for the bus. But if my father would be li \u0152 alive, I \u0152 I would sit with hi m for an hour I learn something. So I was always telling myself, that what I\u2122m missing the most. But I know I couldn\u2122t return the whole thing, so I used to learn myself, I used to ta \u0152 buy books and sits to [indecipherable] after \u0152 after a day\u2122s work, I used to take couple hours of sleep and my \u0152 my daughter and my wife was sleepy, sleepy and I used to wake up, get in the kitchen, the kitchen was big, you know, like \u0152 like this \u0152 this thing, and take a pen and paper and write. I used to write poems and I write a book, was 700 pages. And because I wasn\u2122t [indecipherable] Israel, so I keep the book because they said everybody who \u0152 who had ma terial, you should keep \u0152 we should know in the future, and they took it away and never returned me."
