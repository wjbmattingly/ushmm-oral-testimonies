They lined the Jewish people up on one side and they lined us up on the other side. In nightgowns. That\u2019s why it was summer, it wasn\u2019t cold. And they took a machine gun and they killed the Jewish people. Right there in front of us. We were not, not supposed to cry or help them. They said if you get out of line, you get shot. So we all stood frozen in one line. And then the one guy took a pistol, held to my mom and said I shoot you. And my mom said Jesus help me. And the guy dropped his gun. I don\u2019t know why he dropped the gun, but he dropped it. And he couldn\u2019t shoot it anymore. And then he went, my father said if you want to https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Edith Langer 24 shoot anybody you have to shoot me because I\u2019m the one who got the Jewish people in our house.

And then the whistle go up, one guy put a whistle in his mouth. The whistle go off. A truck came and they all had to go on the truck. Except my mom. My mom had to stay there and she went in the air raid shelter as a Red Cross nurse. She stayed there for four years. And we had to go. They drove us at farms. We had to do farm labor like child labor. At ten years you had to milk five cows in the morning, learn how to drive a tractor. How to plow with horses. We did that all at ten years old. First I cried. I was miserable. And then I got used to it. And but while we were driving out they put gasoline on your house, they put your house on fire. So we lost everything. My mom had to find a room somewhere. And we were at these farms. We are all separated. They put us on four different farms. And that now a big truck we went. And you couldn\u2019t escape. There was nowhere to escape. So we stayed there and I was there for four years. And I got confirmed there you know. So I learned the good work ethic. That\u2019s where I did learn. You know somebody said you have to go to work 5:00, I would be there 5:00. That\u2019s what I did learn. So then after the war, my mom got a taxi. She went to it\u2019s called the Bergersmeister office. You know who the Bergermeister is. Bergersmeister office. They had all the papers and she found out there where we were. And she went in this taxi and picked us all up. No warning. AIl of a sudden she was standing there. You know and I was super glad that I saw her again. And she took around and picked up all my sisters. My brother had run away. And my parents said he went to the Heights MB [ph], to American Legion. And we have never heard from him again. He went there and he disappeared. So he wanted no part of this. So we don\u2019t know where he went. I have looked on the internet, trying to find him but I can\u2019t find him. He might be dead also, cause https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Edith Langer 25 I\u2019m now you know.
