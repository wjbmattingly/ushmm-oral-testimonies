My father being a political activist was persecuted much earlier than the general Jewish population. He was constantly in hiding and at certain times they would storm the house and take him away for short periods of time. So they decided to esca pe Germany and go to Poland and that was Eastern Poland where my mothers family lived and also my fathers family resided in the same city. My mother\u2122s family owned a textile mill and they we re distributors for textiles as well as had the retail store. My recollection of that plays a very vivid they were very happy days even for the fact we were displaced from our home. My gran dparents and the siblings of my mothers and father were living in a very large home, within that there were like apartments where my aunts 2 and uncles were living and I had a lot of cousins. We used to play together. Early restrictions were started to impose upon us as the Germans were storming Poland, but relatively it was a happy time for me."

I do remember wanting to play with a certain child that I like very much and prior to the war we were very good friends and as I approached her one day the mother pulled that litt le girl away she said \ufb01Oh no you can\u2122t play with her any more she is no good she is a Jew\ufb02, and the little girl said \ufb01What is a Jew, she is my friend\ufb02, and that thats when I really started feeling different. It was also the fact that I couldn\u2122t pl ay on the play ground that mainly our activities were restricted to our house, with my coursins being in the same situ ation it made me already feel that some thing bad is coming upon us. We used to play down in the celler in the dark places, mainly inside the house."

            "answer": "Well, I real yes, I, we were relatively off, better off than other families because of the fact of a although all the goods were confiscated and a business was removed and given away to non-Jewish citizens my grandparents an d parents were able to still hide some of the goods and that way they kept up secret trades with the a farmers in the villages and the obtain food, in order to obtain food so were were not initially totally starving. I remember we used to disguise ourselves a wearing shawls and peasant cloths and at night to to the villages and carry these good in exchange for food and many times these farmers would take there goods and not give us the farmers food and we would come back empty ha nded. But I used to look forward to going on these excursions it was an adventure and for a child it was a mysteries way of sneaking through the dark streets in the evening in a disguise aw ay. This was going on for a short period of time until a they were posting all kinds of curfews and th reatening with being killed if we left certain time. The wearing the white bands with blue star and it became much more restrictive."

What we can do and what we can not do and all the restrictions and so on so. It it it became gradually more difficu lt to live, also big impact on us when they started bringing Jews from different countries like Hungry. Suddenly they brought hundreds of Jews and into the synagog where they camped out there and these people were poorly malnourished. They have no food they have no clothing they have to leave suddenly, and thats when we realized that a actually there is a war and that we are going to be involved, by probably being displaced also."

You the windows have to be shut, the doors have to be shut. We we each member of the family was assigned to sit guard behind the window. Lets say 12 hours a day there was a exch ange each member was taking a turn and there was fear. There was anxiety and there was an air of uncertainty. You didn\u2122t know what tomorrow might bring. It it it was a kind of a day to day life, moment to moment really. Along with restrictions I know they form a Unionrod wh ich was a collection of elders and my my uncle was part of that. Unionrod and through him we were learning some of the horrors that were going on in the larger cities not to distant from us. There was our only connection to the outside world."

World war one and the excite ment then they the excitement adventures of wars and I kind of thought that was a really neat thing to be able to wonder from country to country and a see soldiers fighting and so on. And so I imagined that to be the same way. Little did I know that this war was going to be directed against me. My image of a war was soldiers against soldiers not soldiers against children. We really were not, as children we were not prepared for anything realistic the adults probably knew and I used to hear them talk about killings and death and so on but, as children we did not know what to expect."

            "answer": "We were living outsid e Chorkof at at only for a brief period of time. What happened was that soon after they formed the Unionrod we heard of Acktunin an action being a a being performed 5 in all cities around us. Well one day my uncle cam e running from that Unionrod screaming at us to disberse something terrible is going to happe n. He didn\u2122t know what but nothing good and to run away, just get out of the house I don\u2122t want to see you. That was the beginning of the extermination of our town. I remember my mother grabbed me she said \ufb01Lets go lets run\ufb02, some of the other members ran down the we had a ve ry big celler and they ran down there and my mother grabbed me and said \ufb01Lets go.\ufb02 So we we nt outside of the city falling on our floor until we reached some farm farmers houses we heard shot s very soon, very near by we hid in stacks of hay from house to house and the shots were coming closer and closer , we knew we had to move fast, we could only move at night or in the da rk. We crawled to house until we started hearing voices, these were Jewish members of the city carring dead bodies to a near by cemetery. We kept on moving farther and farther away until the lamenting shots became much more distant and pretty soon quieted down. We stayed in a hay stack at a farmers house over night. The space was so small and so tight, that I remember laying there over night doubled over until early morning when the farmers left for the fields. We crawled out of there and the bright day light really blinded us and we stretched out and was pr etty quite and peaceful and then we decided to move back to watch the town. We came back and a deadly silence greeted us there was blood and dead bodies in the street. And we came back to our house and the house was totally ransacked the windows were broken, there was nobody there, we sat on the floor. Pretty soon some members emerged from the celler and th ey were telling us how the Germans were searching homes and killing people and lucky they didn\u2122t discover them in the celler. My father who used to be in hiding all the time escaped last minute and hid in a village. And then when he returned, upon his return he was sure that we were all killed. My uncle who was in the Unionrod was a witness to all these killings and death. At that time my brother who a was not a direct member of the Unionrod, but my uncle use to keep around him there because he thought it a much safer place. Was taken from the Unionrod and he was made to gather all the dead bodies into the villages square and then he was lined up and taken away with the transport. Later on some of the farmers was telling us they st ood and watched and they saw the Jews marching 6 towards the railway station and they saw my brother along side my grandfather march along without a speigel to their death. My uncle described the scene when they lined them up he was pointing with his sad eyes towards him like making a gester rescue me, get me out of this line, but he couldn\u2122t. One of the Jewish elders tried to pull away a little girl out of the line, his own litle daughter, and he was shot on the spot. After that and a few other action occured, they wiped out the total town. The few left over people and among them we were part of the left over population was transported to a city called Lutrouch."

I remember Saturdays when he took me there, there was always singing going on and he was a very good student and in school and he used to tutor other children and I always go along with him and he play the violin and I always hope that some day I would, it was a very close relationship."

I went into total isolation, I did not speak to anybody, I wore black cloths. As a child I associated that already with black cloths, I wouldn\u2122t eat, I just totally went into morning more than any adult. It was a devastating experience for me and I totally refused to acknowledge that he\u2122s not there. I remember even some how get a hold of a piece of chocolate, I don\u2122t know how it ever came to my hands, I refuse to eat it I was saving it when he comes back for him."

I knew that \ufb01They were taken away to camps.\ufb02 And the adults knew that there was no return from those camps, but I as a child refused to believe that. My image was always that he escaped and he will come back. As far as fear I personally, I can not describe the feelings of fear. It was a life of living from moment to moment and I I I just have never had that feeling of fear. I felt that I have to meet what comes and any challenge that will come I should surmount it. It is amazing to me that as a child during those times before this action and this devastating action that took place, my main con cern and regret was I couldn\u2122t go to school. I couldn\u2122t play, I couldn\u2122t go to nursery school that was my main depravation I experienced during those years. Not so much food lack of food or lack of cloths it was more lack of freedom, lack of playing of interaction of other children."

I think we were taken into a horse and wagons and driven to we didn\u2122t know where we were going and after some hours we arrived at this to wn was a very depressing place. I remember coming in a wagon there were cobble stone streets was no lights, houses were dark the streets were filthy and smelling, gray cobble stone and we were taken to a house, which was like a two story house, there were some inha bitants there already. There was a dark corridor there were a few rooms assigned to families, there were like ei ght to 14 people to a room and there was like a communal type of a life. There was a two story house there was only one bathroom on the lower floor and I remember the lines they used to be lined up for that bathroom. I was always thought gee what if someone was constipated and got stuck there and all these people still waiting in line. In a way it wasn\u2122t totally totally a destructive life there because we lived together because there 9 were some children from different families that we interacted right away. Except now we started to experience food shortage and much more limited freedom of movement. We were not allowed to leave that house, toward evening one member of a room snuck out and brought back some food. I remember that ther e was like a black market and my father did not look Jewish at all and he would be the one to leave the house and venture out, he grew a beard and mustache and looked very much Aryan. And he would co me back and bring food. Many a time we didn\u2122t know if he was going to come back because he could have been caught. I still remember specifically in those times members were appointed to sit guard, and I was a little bit older and I was to sit with an adult, looking out through the crack in the window, which was totally covered with a sheets, looking out across the street was the Aryan side. And I used to children walk and children play and I just couldn\u2122t imagine through a children\u2122s eye wh at it would be for me to be able to go across there and just walk.

I saw my grandmother die and she died a natural death on the bed and we, in our home nobody spoke about death. I re member that night, the children were placed in one room only, I guess to protect us from the visual image of a person actually dying and 10 taking the last breath. And the adults and the children, the, my mother's brothers and sisters gathered that night around the bed and we heard the heavy breathing of my grandmother, but we didn't say anything, we just lay th ere motionless and I cannot speak for what the others heard, but I still remember now, it becomes so vivid in my mind, the way she was really gasping for the last breath and I remember my father, who was he r son-in-law, asking for forgiveness and I remember her asking, \"Why, you didn't do anything wrong, I have nothing to forgive you.\" It's the first time that I really speak of that. And I remember as a child hearing that. Nobody spoke anything about it and the following day, naturally it couldn't be funeral, but I remember my uncle, her son and some other men from the hous e were carrying her body wrapped in a white sheet. I did not know, we were not told where they were going and what they are going to do with the body and we never knew whether they were going to come back alive because they had to leave the compound. This was the first time that I spoke about it. Life went on, very restricted, if you can call it life. My father came to realize that it's time to do something about survival and his features were not Jewish and he grew a must ache and he looked totally Aryan, so he used to escape out of this restricted compound to venture on the outside and as I mentioned, to bring us food. One day he took the freedom of leaving for a day and wandered into a village and it was Easter day, Easter morning. While wa ndering through this village and trying to get some food, he started to be suspected as a Jew. At least he was a foreigner there, nobody knew him, said, \"What are you doing here, so mething suspicious about you.\" So he started running to different areas, where he found himself on Easter morning in front of a church. The members of the church were let out after the Easter sunrise ceremony and he was so deep in pain and so much alone, that his heart started crying and he started singing Ailee, ailee(ph), the song from Yom Kippur services, with a loud, stro ng voice. He used to love to sing. The Christians walked out and started asking, \"Who are you and why are you singing here, why didn't you go inside?\" And he started saying, \"M y voice sounds better on the outside and didn't you hear the priest sing that?\" And these pe ople stood around and listening to his singing and 11 then walking away, nodding their heads. It was ironic that he was a Jew, hiding his identity, singing a, a holy Jewish song in front of a Christian audience."

            "question": "When he came back and told you about that incident, was he very worried about going out again? Were you very worried about him?",
            "answer": "We were worried, but we couldn't sit and philo sophically worry. By being on the outside, he was more in touch with reality. He picked up me ssages, he knew that the war is coming closer and closer. And when he returned from the outsi de, he knew that something has to be done and started to organize the men in the compound to build bunkers, hiding places. So, immediate action was taken to build bunkers within the big house or compound. They organized and searched the house and the ground and finally they found what they thought was a great tunnel under the house and constructed a rock that blocked off a certain area. And that was deep tunnel leading to nowhere, that's what they thought and for days they were digging and constructing that bunker. At the same place they built some alternate places, hiding places. One day, very soon, the guard, quote unquote, the guard, was sitting in front of the windows spotted some activity going on on the street with German sold iers popping out on the corners. The signal was given for us to run to the bunker. It was amazing th at prior to that we used to practice every day, how fast we, it has to take for us to run down the stairs and climb up those rocks and one elder was standing and timing us. Well, time came to hide and we started hearing shots. People became panicky and one was climbing up on the ot her too fast, enter that bunker and moved the rocks. I remember there were sick peopl e on the second floor and nobody could carry them down, cause everybody was running towards the bunker and they were left in their beds. The place was very small and the people were crowded together, there was nowhere to move, you couldn't breathe. But unfortunately it didn't last long, pretty soon we heard, started hearing shots and German voices shouting rousse (ph), rousse(ph), which meant ge t out, get out. We couldn't believe that they discovered us so soon, we were so convinced that this was such a safe bunker. What it turned out to be is that the tunnel was leading across the street underground, below some of the stores on the Aryan side and there was the barber shop and when we were digging that 12 tunnel, they used to hear the voices of the Jewish people building that bunker and as soon as this action started, the barber right away notified the Germans and the Polish militia, that there were Jews hiding right underneath and they came straight, without havi ng to search long. They found the rock, they opened the rock and urged us to come out, but nobody would move, so they started shooting into the bunker and throwing some gas ro ckets, whatever it was. People started to move back, towards the wall, there was screaming of children, people bleeding from these wounds inflicted upon them by the shots. There were a few sick people laying right near the entrance, they were shot on the spot. And I remember pulling my mom and my dad and said, \"Let's go.\" And even at that moment, I was th inking of my brother and I said, \"Let's go, we'll join now Joshua.\" On the way out they were beating everybody with clubs. People became disoriented. There was blood running through their faces. They were lined, these soldiers were lined out along the corridor, lining up the people and beating them at the same time, so they will be, came so helpless and disoriented and did not o ffer any resistance. Any resistance would have been met with a bullet anyhow, so there was no point. I remember spotting my uncle, standing there and his blood was dripping from his head an d we could not do anything and we were ready to go. I stood with my parents and I spotted a door and I tried the door and it cracked opened and I pulled my mother and she says, \"Why are you pulling me?\" I said, I pointed with my finger, with my thumb, \"Go over there, go over.\" And then I pulled my father and then I, I pulled them in and we went up the stairs, we we nt up the stairs and there were bodies laying up there on the bed, with the blood dripping down and went into a room and each of us hid under the bed in a puddle of blood. And then we heard the lamenting voices from downstairs and pretty soon it became more quiet. Suddenly we heard footsteps running up the stairs and a voice saying in Polish, \"I saw you running up there, I know you are hiding. Stay under the bed until it becomes quiet and then go down and hide again.\" And he disappeared. As it became quiet we emerged from under the beds and we went into a di fferent hiding that my fa ther constructed. It was located on top of a toilet which pretended to be like a ceiling. Pretty soon the Germans and the Polish militia returned with some other citize ns, to remove the dead bodies and to do a last 13 minute search. They entered the toilet room where we were hiding a nd instead of looking up, they looked down and there was a child that fell through the toilet seat, it was a constructed toilet, not like we have here and this child was deep in feces and the soldiers were standing there and laughing and one said, \"Don't waste a bullet, she'll drown in the feces anyhow, \" and walked away. We remained breathless up on top, until all the bodies were removed and the doors were closed. Later we emerged from our hiding and th ere were a few other people that survived in that same room."

            "question": "What did you do immediatel y after this actione(ph)?",
            "answer": "Well, as we were lucky enough to escape the s econd time in that toilet , hiding, we stayed in that house for a day or two until everything quiete d down and pretty soon [pause], we remained in the house, all the four of us, wondering what's going to ha ppen next. We did not remain for long alone. Few days after this total destruction, new transports were coming in from nearby cities and villages. These were new resettlers . The house was filled again with Jews from all over the area. Some urban, some rural, people that had only in common by being persecuted by the Nazis because of being Jewish. They came fro m all walks of life. We befriended one family that was a farming, a Jew from a farm that had a little girl my age and we became friends. My father, being again mobile and circling around the non-Jewish quarters, was aware that the war is coming to an end and this is a time, a final actio n that they final soluti on of the Jewish question is in sight. And his only way of escape would be to do it now, otherwise we are doomed to die. We were lucky enough that we were able to save gold and silver coins that we carried in our clothing, hidden in seams. And my father appr oached this, befriended a family, his name was Abraham and told them that he would offer him money in order for both of the families to escape. His idea was, because Abraham knew all these farmers and had such great faith in his village, that he would send Abraham to find a hidi ng place. The plan was to divide our families so that in case somebody's killed, one member at least, will remain. Abraham went back to the farm and was to come up with three hiding places. He left, but we never knew whether he would return or not. After some time he did return and announce that he found a place and the children would go first. Thus it was decided that I and his little girl would follow him. The eve of one day, we were to follow Abraham through fields and paths, through forests, moving forward through the night and hiding in the fields during the day, in orde r not to be spotted by farming people in the fields. We crawled on our four , until Abraham decided that he was going to venture out and find a farming house and we stayed in the fields until he returns. The two little 15 girls remained laying there, waiting for Abraham to return. It took days til he returned and announced that he found a place, we ought to follow him and just run into a barn, in towards the evening, without telling anybody or speaking to anybody. That night he let us into a barn, we climbed up on a high stack of hay and Abraham said goodbye to us and left us there. And if, if we only knew that we are in a barn, but we had no concept where we were, we had no image whether this was a city, a village, a town, a farmer's house. We had no concept what's on the outside. We could only tell day fr om night by the sound of the environment, like the crack of the dawn, the rooster, the rooster would crow, or towards the evening the farmers would return from the fields. The only other being was the horse in the barn and we knew day from night when the horse would return from work in the field. A nd the morning when the farmer would come and feed the horse and get him ready to go to the field."

We re mained laying on top of that high stack of hay, which was piled up, up to the roof of the barn. Our food consisted of a morning ration of water and a piece of dry bread. The farmer would bring the water, a buc ket of water to feed the horse and out of that he poured some for us. He ha d a hiding place for the ladder and he would quickly assemble the ladder and with a sound, with a sign al of a cough, he would approach the haystack and quickly place the, some wate r and a piece of bread and immediately descend. This repeated itself at night. The only change of meal was on a holiday or a Sunday, where instead of water, we would get some milk. We could hear the chil dren outside playing in the yard and we were never sure whether they were going to run into the barn and play, although the farmer made sure that the ladder is not in sight. The only companion was the horse. We laid stretched out on the, on top of that haystack, two little girls, covered under a blanket that blended in with the hay, not speaking to each other in order to conserve ener gy. We could not stand up, there was room only to sit or lay and thus was our days going, flowing in from day to day. We could not tell time, we could not tell season, we just existed up there. 16"

The horse, hearing that noise, got up and made a lot of commotion. I laid there and cold, bleeding, the floor was cement. Lisa, my friend up there could not help me, we could not speak, not make noise. The farmer came in and saw me laying there and did not say anything, just walked out again, in order not to arouse suspicion. We, I wondered what is going to happen. I couldn't mo ve. The following day the farmer came back and placed a ladder, motioning for me to climb back up.

We knew that it\u2122s only, it would take only one moment to be discovered either by a child or by a neighbor, by 19 somebody walking into the barn and suspecting someth ing. And as a matter of fact, that\u2122s what happened. Through some mysterio us way, the farmer, not beknown to us or to himself became a suspect of hiding, quote unquote, hiding Jews. One day when he wa s out in the field working, we suddenly heard some suspicious sounds, loud sound s of militia approaching the barn. Within a moment or two, we realized that this is danger lurking right behind the barn and what do we do? With a glance at each ot her we knew that we have to escape and how do you escape? There\u2122s no ladder and we are way up high there and those voic es are coming closer and closer. We jumped off that big high haystack and by some miracle we got up from that cold ston e floor and ran through half-open door and behind another haystack and the ya rd and then into the wide fields. Just in that moment as we went thr ough that yard, the militia was approaching the gate and entered the barn. There was loud noises and singing and voices of joy assuming that they are gonna catch us. Well we were right behind. They ran into the farmer\u2122s house, ransacked his hous e and did not find us. We in turn laid in the field. It was broad da ylight and the sun was pi ercing through the high cornfields. We laid there until the evening approac h, approached. We\u2122re afra id to go too far away from the village, yet by staying too close, we were in dang er of being discovered. Now, and by going too far we\u2122d have, we would have lost our way back to th e same house. That night we moved back and ran back into that barn. There was no la dder so we couldn\u2122t climb up so we just laid there on the floor. The farmer suspecte d that we would return and came in at night into the barn and found us there. He mumb led something and then pl ace the ladder and we climbed up. However, he was not too happy because next mo rning no food was delivered to us. That following night, Abram heard in his hiding place that, th at farmer\u2122s house was ransacked an d he was sure th at we got caught and killed. And he came to find bodies in that barn. He came and sat there at night and didn\u2122t see any blood on the floor so he thought maybe they took us aw ay and killed us in the fields. He sat in that barn quiet, assuming that th e farmer will come in and he did but his only greeting was that to take us away, right away he will not subject his family to danger. And he wanted us out. Despite all the pleading, Abram had won his confidence by giving hi m a day or two to go out and find another hiding place. He agreed to wait \u201atil Abram returns next day. Ne xt day Abram never did 20 come back. We did not know what to expect. We thought maybe he was killed. However, after a few days, Abram came back and took us. He took us to, not find, not being to able to find a new hiding place, he divided us up and took us to where my parents were and took his little girl to where he was hiding at. I was very weak and quite ill and it did me well be st aying with my parents."

            "answer": "Yes. It was a planned situati on that we knew that they were in hiding. We did not know where and we had no concept of the geogr aphic location of the whole village . But we did know that they were alive and as the plan was, to divide us up, it was not a surprise that they were close by. The hiding place they were at was designated by th eir farmer as only for two people and when the farmer walked in and sa w an additional person he said, \ufb01No wa y. I did not agree to three.\ufb02 We tried to bribe him and give him some more gold. He took it and then next day changed his mind. He said, \ufb01You gotta go.\ufb02 And so again, Abram was caught between having to take us out of this hiding place and not finding another. We were chas ed out, by now it was turning cold and winter snow was on the ground. I was very weak, practically unable to walk and Abram was just trying to help by finding another place which wa s no avail. I was be gging him to leave me there on the cold white snow. I could not walk anymore. The wi nd was fierce in an op en field, the snow was blowing, and I, all I wanted is to be left alone. But Abram said, \ufb01As God is my witness, I\u2122m not gonna let you die.\ufb02 And he carried me on his shoulders and he was alternating. My father did a little bit carrying and we wandered days in that bitter cold in the white snow until we spotted a dark object far away. Abram ventured out by leaving us on the snow and moving forward to examine what it was, came back few feet, telling us that it looked like it\u2122s a house and that we have no choice but try to go towards it. We ch ose to wait there in th e snow while he himself ventured out. He 21 dared to walk into that house a nd came out alive, coming back to us and carrying us, carrying me back into that house. It turned out to be an isolated little hut in the prairie and the cold snow, a very very poor farmer allowing us, agr eeing to take us in. We entered the barn which was totally empty. This time there was neither a horse nor a cow nor hay. We lay down on the cold floor just waiting. The farmer was very poor. It was one of these, God\u2122s people really, that had nothing worldly around him. He had chil dren, they had no shoes, therefore stayed inside th e house. Therefore the danger of them running in to the barn was diminished. He expl ained to us that he had a cow that died because he could not feed her so he had no mil k. His crop died in that cold weather and he had no bread and the gold that we gave him was no avail to him becau se he could not go into the market to buy anything because he was know n to be the poorest soul in the area. So on a Sunday we would have some potatoes but he was so poor that he couldn\u2122t afford any salt. But he was good-hearted and really sympathized with our fate. For so me time we stayed there until one day we heard shots. These were very distant and we did not pay much attention until the farmer came and said, \ufb01Do you know the war\u2122s approaching. The Russians are coming nearer and n earer and they are beating the Germans and you\u2122re going to be fr ee soon.\ufb02 We did not believe that . We continued to remain in the same position, very pessimistic and doubting whether we would ever get out alive from these places. One night, we h eard very close shots. Pr ior to those shots, we heard this lamenting of human beings was was, which was so painful, was like these lamenting cats that sometime cry at night. It was so close that we thought that it\u2122s approaching us and soon engulf us in it. I remember thinking is this how you die, by hearing these voices coming out of nowhere? Pret ty soon, we heard some voices knocking, some sound knocking at the door of the farmer\u2122s house and later we learned that Abraham, his little girl and his wife, at th e last minute prior to the Russian Army approaching the village, were taken out by one of the farmers that they were hiding at. Abram and his wife and daughter were dragged out into the open field, close to th is farmer\u2122s house and shot to death. Thus was the end of Abraham after all these wanderings. After all thes e narrow escapes, the friendly farmer, the farmer that Abraham fed and provide d clothing and provided food for his family and his animals, thus was the end of Abraham, shot by his own quote unquote fr iendly farmer. The man 22 that was totally a stranger to us, our farmer, explaine d to us that the knocking at the door was one of the militia men that asked him to go out and bury those bodies. The fa rmer described these three bodies laying in blood and the blood was still warm, melting the white snow. And the ground was so frozen that he couldn\u2122t dig any holes. After whil e, he just had to leave them there and cover them up with the snow. Days after, the farmer came back to the barn sayi ng, \ufb01You know, the end is here. The Russians are coming.\ufb02 We did no t believe it. He said, \ufb01Look, you can come into my house.\ufb02 His house really consisted of one room where five people were living, three children and his wife. His wife was ill and was in bed. But we did not dare leave that barn until one knock at the door convinced us that freedom is here. He came in, the farmer came in, just refused to close that door and dragged that, dragged us into the house. By th en, soldiers came in and he explained us that the Russians are here. The Russians in deed were there. They were friendly. My father, teaching himself the Russian language, started talking to them with tears in his eyes. My mother, I remember, was kissing their hands and the Russian soldiers were patting her saying, \ufb01Devie (ph), devie (ph),\ufb02 which means no, no, don\u2122 t have to do that. We are here to liberate you. And then they saw me and they lifted me up and said indeed, that\u2122s a yehvooshkod (ph), that\u2122s a little girl. They saw that we barely were breathing and embraced us and brought in cases of food and prepared us for departure. We knew that we couldn\u2122t stay in that house any longer , that we had to move forward because the battlefield was right there. There were bombs explod ing all around us. The Russians dropped us off at the ne arest village and despite the fact that quo te unquote we were liberated, the danger was lurking behind each and every house. The Ukra inian population was not very friendly to survivors. They we re trying to kill us at every mome nt that we took a step in that village. At one moment, a, one of the villagers lifted his, an ax, trying to chop off our heads, when a Russian tank rolled by and noticed that and shot the man on the spot. I remember the villagers standing on the streets and pointing at us and we had to protect ourselves by hiding behind the tanks that were rolling by. I remember my father going over to on e of the villagers saying, pointing to me saying, \ufb01You see, she doesn\u2122t have any horns on her head. She\u2122s just a little girl like yours.\ufb02 And then the farmer spit in his face. The Russian Army was really the key to our survival. They took us 23 in their tanks despite the limitations and regulations not to pick up civilians. They brought us from village to village and until the, a certain destination where they could not move on any longer. They placed me in a farmer\u2122s hom e and instructed the farmer to light the fire in the oven, made room for me to stay in a warm place, brought in cases of Spam and ordered the farm er to feed us, warning them that they\u2122ll come back in a few days and they wanted to fi nd us alive. Meanwhile, the battle was going on and we had to move on."

These were Polish, Polish people, young, young gang members organized against Jews and were trying to do harm to the Jewish population. Not so much by killing them but definitely robbing them of their 27 goods and making their li fe not very pleasant for the remainder of the Jewish popul ation.

I always had the feeli ng that I was not welcome there, I was not liked. The Polish students did not socialize with me. There was one more Jewish student there and so the ratio was like 98 percent, 99 percent non-Jews, a nd maybe one percent Jew. Was me and another young man, young child, young boy. We were excl uded from, again when there was religion we had to wait outside. We c ould not participate in certain club activities and there was certain remarks, there were remarks made behind our backs. There was not a very friendly atmosphere in school.

And there it was like a displa ced camp which you have a lluded to although we did not see it as a camp. There were individual houses within cer tain area, there were no walls to the area except it was outside of the city with an area of wood s and flowerbeds and it was very pleasant. There, there was a Jewish self-ruling committe e established where all the administrative work was done by a, by an elected quote unquote government body. And my father happened to become one and we was kind of considered to be the elite group of that commune. My uncle who returned from the Russian Army, he was the only one that survived due to the fact that he was threaten to the Russian Ar my, was the physician for that whole ar ea. And again we were fed well. We had a ample supply of food. My, my own concern was to go on with my education and I did not like living in that commune so because of th e school being in the dow ntown area, my parents and I decided that I would move out and live with a family, ir onic enough, a German family. However, I had my own r oom and I could go to school in th e morning then I would have tutors come in the afternoon to their ho use where I could totally concentr ate on my studies and, and I\u2122d have tutors either going to their homes or they coming to my home. These tutors were former Nazi professors, they were not allowed p ublicly to teach anymor e in the school system so they made their living by tutoring students . And that\u2122s, I fell in to the hands again of fo rmer Nazis. Since my objective was to get as much as I can as far as educatio n was concerned, to catch up for the times that I lost, I decided to forgo th e fact that these were Nazis and continued on without dwelling upon political differences . I also in the afternoon, a ttended a special course for quote Creeksbeshaydickter (ph) which means, meant that all the people that participat ed in the war, in the German Army could not attend regu lar school and these were former Nazi yooogunt (ph) and Nazi soldiers that volunteered early in life to be in th e army. A special course was created for them at a very fast pace to catch up on all the education requirements. And we found out about it and I applied for that and I got accepted so I was the only female student, Jewish, sitting with all former Nazis, Nazi soldiers, Hitler yoogunt (ph) that dur ing breaks made the same remarks that I used to hear before that how sorry they are that they didn\u2122t kill off all the Jews and that they had to do it 30 over again, they would volunteer over again and they had no hesitation admitting how, how they are looking forward to the Nazis coming back and regain ing the power."

And they made sure that the Jewish, remaining Jewish population had a place to live by, by placing them in ho mes where former Nazis lived and restricted der Libenstraum (ph) just like they restricted ours for a long period of ti me. It was not very pleasant to live with these people because you were reminded every day that what, that they were sorry that they did not complete the job of total liquidati ng the Jewish race and that they\u2122d have to do it over again, they would. So they never left that doubting that they are sorry that it did not come to be, what they planned to do. Otherwise, life wa s very beautiful in Munich. Again, I enjoyed my student years.

The musical life, I reme mber, for the first time when Leonard Bernstein came to conduct a symphony and I went ther e and he personally, I got to shake hand s with him. it was such a thrill for me.

Unfortunately, the, the, the student body at Europ ean universities is not a very close-knit, it\u2122s not that you attend a class and you\u2122re part of that class.

For lots of people, this was just a waiting period to move on to differen t states, midwest and Chicago and so on. Being that people had 34 relatives in those parts of the United States. We were destined to stay in New York since my father had a cousin. It was a time of sear ch, a time of inst ability, a time of insecurit y, a time of losing selfrespect for oneself, being that we were dependent on this Hebrew Aid Soci ety to provide us with lodging and food. We had only a limited amount of resources to establish our own identity. The sponsor that signed for us was a cousin of my father\u2122s who wa s a millionaire in New York, being the proprietor of a multi-m illion dollar business consisting of all, of all the th ings, there was hairnets that he imported from China that were folded and bagged in his plant in New York City. We naturally visited him and other memb ers of his family and the first th ing to do was to invite us for dinner. Well after the dinner , the first question said, so, what are you gonna do here?

            "question": "This is a United States Ho locaust Memorial Museum interview with Dr. Anne Resnick conducted by Amy Rubin on November 25 th, 1996 in Washington, D.C. This is tape three, side A. You were telling me about meeting with your cousin and what he was starting to ask you about what you were going to be doing in the U.S.",
            "answer": "Ah, my father replied, \ufb01I\u2122ll do what I always do . I\u2122ll find a way to star t a business.\ufb02 Said, \ufb01Well how are you gonna start? You don\u2122 t have any money. I\u2122m gonna give you a job because I signed for that.\ufb02 So he offere d a job for my mother and for myself. Now legally I was not supposed to be working yet. He placed us in a sweatshop where it was packed with women sitting alongside a large long table folding those nets, hairnets and pl acing them in envelopes. The work was so fast and depended on the success of the speed. There was a foreman there, supervising the working women which have been work ing there for years and were very well suited for that job. Except the two of us, strangers and never having be subjected to that kind of wo rk. And he used to stand there with a real whip and hit the tabl e and we used to withdraw our hands because we were not fast enough. After few days of that kind of envi ronment, we walked out and feeling very disappointed, I kept on walking the streets of 5 th Avenue, seeing a different world for myself. I, at the same time, I had the great sense of art and I loved to sew and pr epare clothes and I started to design children\u2122s clothing and until one person noticed that and gave me a lead where I presented it to a manufacturer. And after a while, I was designing children\u2122s wear at one of the biggest companies in New York. I was not happy with my life though. I used to finish a job and say we ll, so what else did I do today? Another piece of cloth. I, my, I, but I was determined to help my parents get established. I also won scholarship but that was a chance that I took and, subjecting myse lf to a certain test that I saw at an international student organization offering a scholarship in Texas, So uthwestern University. So I was awarded their, their, I wa s awarded that scholarship, went down to Texas, stayed there for a short while at the University but I guess I had a guilt feeling leavi ng my parents in New York and, not really knowing what, how they gonna survive and what they were gonna do. So I dropped everything and came back to New York. But then my father had, still had some resources, financial 36 ones and had bought a grocery store and we all he lped. My mother became the major storekeeper as my father was mainly ordering milk and supplies and that\u2122s ho w we got our feet back and got back into business. I then, it was time that I get out of this fami ly business and my parents having lost all their property and home and textile plant in Europe thought that maybe they could get it back. A movement was on for _ _________, meant that the Germ an government should restore some of the property to the Jews. I, there not bein g very happy in that environment of store and just doing designing, I decided to go back to Europe and to enroll in the university there and at the same time try to see if I could regain some of our, our property. It was difficult for me to stay in New York and continue my educ ation there although I could have stay ed in Texas but I, again, did not feel very suited in that, for that area, being that was a total different culture between, in Texas and myself. I went back to Munich and enrolled at the university and was determined to pursue medical degree and become a physician. I did make some contacts with that __________ of fice but they discouraged me saying that there properties will never be recovered. By then my father had had some account in a Swiss bank and he suggested that I transfer myself to Bairn (ph), Switzerland and enroll at the university, continue my medical studies there an d while trying to recover the monies from the bank. But that again, was to no avail. I went to the bank and they said there\u2122s no such account. But I stayed on at the Un iversity of Bairn (ph). I enjoye d the studies there and I graduated with honors. Switzerland was nice in the effect that I had all the freedom to study and there was a small Jewish student population there where you could interact and pu rsue your studies. That was my aim and that\u2122s was my goal and that\u2122s why I went there. I used to come home to New York in the summer. I used to take fellowships at va rious hospitals and join various international medical students\u2122 groups and learned a lot an d there was my life: to learn and to be able to do medicine. I graduated from the University of Ba irn (ph) and then I met my father in Israel after graduation. And the meantime, a very sad thing happened, while I wa s in Bairn (ph), my mother was ill, became ill and was diagnosed with ovarian can cer. I came back to New York and faced that reality. It was very difficult since being in medicine, I knew what the outcome would be. However, I had to go back and continue my life. During my last year of school, I was not aware of this grave situation 37 and my mother passed away without me being at her bedside. My father upon consultation with a rabbi decided not to let me know until it was too late for me to come \u201acause they were afraid that I would stop school and never return to it. And being in the last year they thought it would be wise for me to finish and that I defini tely could not change the situation. This is still a very heavy guilt that is weighing upon my shoulders, not being able to hold the hand at the end of her life and I\u2122ll just have to live with it."

            "answer": "In 1995. I had joined a certain organization through the Jewi sh community, Jewish Federation in L.A. They had some programs, cultural programs a nd I came upon certain people. They were child survivors in different coun tries, in Scandinavian countries and th ey were telling of their experiences as orphans being taken to a priest, by priests int o, Jesuits and churches and lived in orphanages. And they had the most interesting stories to tell and finally I joined them. Although I did not speak much on my experience , I had this feeling that I be longed to a certain group, that is child survivors. In 1995, my son being a student at the University of Pennsylvania, visited Washington and visited the museum, the Holocaust Museum and came back and had asked me to talk about my experiences. Although I never did sp eak to my children about it, I did speak to high school students at the Jewish Federation and I became a docent at the Museum of the Holoca ust in L.A., in Los Angeles."

I just was so involved with succeeding in life and, and pursuing what I wa nted to do in my life and, and medi cine was my only go al in life. And 38 then I got married and I had two beautiful successful children and I think I instilled upon them the same love of learning and that there was my all, my whole awareness was the presence, the present, not thinking of the past. Now that I start dwelli ng on the past and seeing that, I had no childhood, that I had lived this life in hiding and during pe rsecutions and a very unusua l childhood, I, I begin to realize that it, I think it made me a stronger person although I cannot imagine how it would have been had I had a normal childhood."

            "answer": "This is entitled, \ufb01A Day in the Life of a Hidden Child.\ufb02 It was a day as it was in those times, a dark stable, a horse, a high stack of hay. This, this hay occupied a space almost up to the roof. Two little girls, motionless, lying side by side, communicating only with a whisper, a sigh. Sharing the same destiny for no reason or fault of their own. Each different, ea ch from different corners of the world, thrown into a doomed fate of struggle an d despair. Both cuddling an imaginary dream on their worn-out blanket, the color of hay to blend in with. The space was small, only room to sit but not to stand. The positi on assumed was horizontal, laying down only, to reduce friction, to conserve energy, time of the day judged by the sounds of th e outside. Sunrise by th e crowing of the rooster, sundown by the return of the villagers from the fields. Sund ays and holidays by the presence of the horse in the stable, by the small ration of milk instead of water. At the crac k of the dawn, the farmer would enter the barn, getting the horse ready for a day\u2122s work. He would carry a pail of water, some of which we would share w ith the horse and a piece of dry bread under his shirt. With a cough, he would signal his approach, produce a ladde r and place it at the edge of the hay. He would 39 place then, the water and the bread at the edge and then quickly di sappear removing the ladder as quick as possible. This exchange was so fast, was so quick that we never had the chance to see his face. Time wa s of essence."

I had to pass certain exams in order to qualify to do post-graduate traini ng and I remained in New York for a brief period of time and then obtained a pediatric internship at the Universi ty of Buffalo Child ren\u2122s Hospital.
