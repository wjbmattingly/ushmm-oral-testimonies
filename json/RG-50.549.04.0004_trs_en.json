So my first question would be, give our listeners who don\u2019t know your parents a sense of who they were. Your father -- who did you see o-of -- ho-how did you see your father when you were younger, and how did you see your mother?",
            "answer": "Well, my mother stayed at home, so I saw a lot more of her than my father, who worked very hard. My father, I always knew had family. I never met anyone of my mother\u2019s family until I was eight years old and we met an aunt through marriage in Germany. I know that my mother took me abroad when I was, I believe one year old, but of course I don\u2019t remember having met her then. But I never knew family from my mother\u2019s side, which was a tremendous loss th-that I felt as a child. I knew that there was a huge, huge part of childhood experience, having grandparents and Interview with Shelly Rothschild-Sherwin , March 15, 2001 aunts and uncles and cousins missing from my life. I was very keenly, keenly aware of it."

Ho-How did -- how -- did you -- how did you ask them about it? Did you ask your mother, how come I don\u2019t have grandparents? How -- how did this evolve?",
            "answer": "My father came before the war, so his experience was growing up in America from late teenage-hood on, here, as his brothers and sisters, who had been farmed out from Germany before the war. And they all had international experiences, some went to South America, some went to Palestine, some -- I mean, every brother and sister was sent to a different relative around the world. His parents both died before I got to know them, his mother outlived his father, and was alive when I was born, but also died when I was quite young. My mother\u2019s side of the family only came through me -- to me verbally, because there were no -- no pictorial histories or scrapbooks, or mementos handed down. So it was only her stories and my imagination that gave them any kind of reality."

The intellectual capabilities, the accomplishments. Her family was very accomplished in many different fields. Sh -- and I think that\u2019s why she had great hopes that I would be a pianist like one of her cousins who was world renowned. That didn\u2019t do t -- I didn\u2019t do too well there. Maybe a dancer. The Russian -- the Russian ballet instructor told my mother, save your money. So th -- so -- so there were -- there were quite a few talents that I did not pick up from her fa -- family side, but reading and education were certainly something that she impressed upon me and I developed my own curiosity in pursuing."

            "answer": "No, the dawning was gradual, but the visual indicator was always there. My mother was always physically very different than other mothers. Her physical disabilities worsened as I grew up, and it was because her condition was becoming much more visible and apparent to the outside world that then I came to understand Interview with Shelly Rothschild-Sherwin \u00b0 March 15, 2001 that she had been born perfectly normal, but because of the beatings that she received in the camp, it was the cause of these physical abnormalities worsening."

            "answer": "There was never a special day that I remember, that was set aside to say this 1s what happened to me. It was, I think, always part of my consciousness. I think -- I remember one thing, one day I remembered seeing one of my friend\u2019s parents who had a number on their arm, and I asked my mother why she didn\u2019t have a number on her arm. So I knew that there was a commonality of experience that my friend\u2019s parents had been in camps, and my mother had been in camp, but there was a difference. And I think that started the storytelling a bit more."

            "answer": "The area that I grew up in in the Bronx was a terrific mix of Jewish, Italian, Irish and in high school, black. But for th -- my earliest school experiences, I would say 95 percent of my classmates -- at that time New York used to place you in a class of your ability, so the classes were numbered one, two, three, four, so if you were in Interview with Shelly Rothschild-Sherwin \u00b0 March 15, 2001 the first grade in the first class, that means that you were the most academically superior. So always being in that first class, it seemed that the make-up was 95 percent Jewish at that time."

            "answer": "The three friends that I have from when I was 10 years old were all American born and their parents were American born, so no, they -- they didn\u2019t experience the particular childhood that I did. But I had other friends in the second circle of my -- of my associates that had Holocaust survivor parents."

            "answer": "Sometimes I remember there were discussions at -- at -- at lunch about parents having nightmares and we would only discuss it amongst ourselves. My mother wasn\u2019t one of those, but -- but I had a friend, Mary Chewbowski who used to tell Interview with Shelly Rothschild-Sherwin \u2018 March 15, 2001 me about her mother\u2019s nightmares, and we were very protective of each other. It was almost a different circle of friends, the immigrant kids, then the other Jewish kids who really didn\u2019t have any way of relating to what it was like to have to be a nurturing support to your elder parent. It was -- it was a role reversal even at a younger age that some of my friends had. My mother at that point was stronger than some of my friend\u2019s parents, who were much more emotionally crippled at that stage, at that stage. My mother was stronger, but the years have taken their toll."

            "answer": "I was an only child. I was told very early on that my mother had lost all her family, and when the doctors told her that she was not supposed to have a child, that her response was that she didn't survive the war not to have a child. So no matter what the physical cost was going to be -- which put a little guilt on me because I knew that she was taking a risk and did damage her condition further by bearing me, but that she felt that she lived for a purpose and the purpose was to have a family, and that was me, but there was only just me. So I didn\u2019t have any brothers and sisters. I didn\u2019t have any grandparents or cousins, or people from her side that she could relate to.

            "answer": "My mother will probably say that I was spoiled, and I don\u2019t think so. My -- I was- | was -- I will admit that my parents were extraordinarily generous of their time and the amount of input that they put into my cultural awareness. I grew up in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, I tell everybody that I did. I -- I spent more time going to botanical gardens and zoos and Radio City Music Hall, and shows when I was young. And I turned around and did the same thing for my daughter because my -- my life -- my childhood was so full of extraordinary outings, that I couldn\u2019t wait to turn around and do that when I had a child, so I -- my -- my social activities with my parents were extraordinary. Maybe that was to make up for lack of family affairs."

            "answer": "No, I wasn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t exposed to these things necessarily to have them drummed into my psyche that this 1s what you must know in order to be a cultured person. Everything was on an equal basis. Going to the movies, or seeing the Interview with Shelly Rothschild-Sherwin \u201d March 15, 2001 Rockettes was on the same level as going to a ballet. So everything was done with a sense of -- of fun and a special occasion, and dressing up and going downtown to Manhattan. So it was -- it -- 1t was never an expectation that I would be able to then recite to impress anybody what I had been exposed to. It was just something that would cu -- just culturally open me up to the rest of the world, outside of New York."

            "answer": "L always believed my parents to be much more strict than my mu -- than my friend\u2019s parents who were American born. And we\u2019re talking about my Jewish friends. Some of their parent were the -- brought up in the 40\u2019s here, very liberal, virtually leaning on the Communist way, so that they were allowed to stay out late and make decisions for themselves when my parents said, we have to know where you are and who you\u2019re with and what time you\u2019re going to come back, and so I felt that there was much stronger bungee cords on my freedom than my par -- than my - my peers experienced. Now that I\u2019m a parent, I don\u2019t know whether it wasn\u2019t a good idea, cause I probably mimicked more than I -- than I want to admit. But no, my parents were more strict than my friends.

            "answer": "I went to public schools, New York public schools were wonderful at that time, and then to, as I said, keep broadening my field of reference, my parents would, on a very meager income, sacrifice and send me to Swiss schools for the summertime. I always say that there was a finishing school and th-they finished me off but good. I\u2019m very polished, highly polished, to a g -- a great gloss.

My memories of them are that I -- I know that they sent me away from the city so I didn't have to bear the city heat. My -- before I was sent away to camp, we always went away -- my mother and I went to the Catskills, and my father would come up weekends, just like the other fathers would come up and visit, so that my summers were very pleasant. But then when I became of an age where there- they wanted to also have some kind of growing experience, or benefit to be derived from a summer away, that\u2019s when they looked into these schools in Switzerland for me, and I went to the same one for two summers in a row."

            "answer": "The ho -- interesting, you know, the Holocaust itself did not. There were some Jewish children who came from very nouveau riche families in New York, and there were Arab children there as well whose -- the younger ones were being trained to hate anyone Jewish. The older ones my own age were a bit more tolerant. This 1s- you -- you know where -- this was close to when Israel had been founded, so there was some leniency and understanding with the children my own age, but the younger ones were already being disciplined to avoid us, and they called us -- they called me the enemy. I re -- I remember that distinctly, that the younger wa -- younger ones would come up to the table when I was sitting with friends and they would say, how could you sit with the enemy?

Some of my American second generation friends were experimenting with drugs, and this is where the strictness factor came in with my parents, they -- they practically used to sniff out the backpacks of my friends when they came in, were very, very protective about what was coming into the house, and- and what was be -- what activities were being engaged outside of the house.

I had a visual reminder every single day of what happened to her. Every time I look at her now, the entire Holocaust experience is encapsulated in when I look at her. So knowing the specifics was not as important as grasping the entire experience. And it happened 1- in the smallest things. When I had to go shopping with my mother and nothing ever fit because her deformity is so limiting in what she can and cannot even try on. I Interview with Shelly Rothschild-Sherwin March 15, 2001 was aware of it on so many different levels. Her physical limitations, her lack of energy, her -- the pain that she\u2019s in, the brace that she has to decide whether to put on or take off.

So there can be -- even though the number of my mother\u2019s family is finite, when I see pictures of hundreds, they all become related to me in a sense because anyone of them could have been a true family member. I'll never know which ones were. It -- on rare occasions my mother has found books and she has found not Holocaust photographs, but from before the war, photos of people who were in her family, in very formal, stylized portraits. And I look at them Interview with Shelly Rothschild-Sherwin March 15, 2001 almost like I look at a picture of Queen Victoria, there\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s such a far relation, it\u2019s saying my goodness, this is a person who was in my family.

And for the very reason because her personality seemed to be -- she was in awe of other kids, and I remember feeling, in my school, that I wasn't the top student, so that the expectations were always that these are the top students, and I know where I belong in the pecking order.

Let\u2019s come to sort of a -- a few issues that are potentially very large, but I would like to leave it up to you how much you want to respond to it. And the first question is, what kind of role does your Jewish identity or faith play in your life?",
            "answer": "I wouldn\u2019t be anything else but Jewish, given a choice. I love being Jewish. I think being culturally Jewish is a tremendous part of my personality. I don\u2019t know who I would be, or what I would be like 1f I wasn\u2019t Jewish. I mean, it\u2019s that much a part of my psyche. And on the other hand, when it comes to pure religion and observance, I\u2019m more observant than my mother. My husband and I made that determination when we had our daughter, that we wanted religion to be a spiritual backbone. Not strict, not strictly enforced, but certainly the spiritual foundation that it gives someone in terms of an identity. That she would feel as comfortable in her skin being Jewish as I was, but I had the unique experience of growing up in a very Jewish community in New York City, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s also interwoven for me. And my husband grew up in a Jewish area in -- in London. But 1 -- but a -- a New York Jew is an entity unto itself. What you see on television is what I g -- is what -- is what my life was growing up. My -- my daughter when she was going through Interview with Shelly Rothschild-Sherwin *\u00b0 March 15, 2001 school -- it\u2019s interesting, in my parent\u2019s house they did not speak Yiddish. My mother\u2019s family in Poland did not speak Yiddish because her mother\u2019s side of the family was Sephardic and that was the -- obviously the s -- the Spanish side, 1t was not -- it was the Ashkenazic that spoke Yiddish in the house. And I had a summer job once, working for a doctor in the Catskills, and I picked up a tremendous amount of Yiddish, because it was with an elderly Jewish clientele, and I brought up my daughter with these little Yiddish expressions. And she felt so comfortable in her Jewish skin, that she would routinely use them in her compositions in school, and sometimes get comments on the t -- on the papers from the teacher saying, I don\u2019t understand this word. So I encouraged her creativity and said, if that\u2019s the word that best describes how you\u2019re feeling, then just put a footnote at the bottom of the page, which is what she started doing in grade school. If -- if a Yiddish word sufficed, she would use it, and then put a footnote in for those people who didn\u2019t understand it. And so even when we converse now, it\u2019s not that either of us are fluent Yiddish speakers, but th -- there are certain expressions that we do use routinely. So that\u2019s -- that\u2019s where I fit in in terms of being culturally how I identify myself, and in terms of personality. I cannot split where my Judaism leaves off and where the rest of me begins. They\u2019re -- they\u2019re inextrictably entwined. Religiously is a different story. In -- in following the rituals, when my daughter was going to Interview with Shelly Rothschild-Sherwin 7 March 15, 2001 Hebrew school in preparation for her Bat Mitzvah and my husband and I started a temple with 18 other couples, it was an extraordinary life changing event to be in on the -- on the formation of a temple. I -- we never worked as hard, we never sat on as many committees, we never had so little free time as we did, and yet we look upon that as the most golden period in our lives because we did something really so constructive. But when it got down to actually being alone with my thoughts with God, it\u2019s a love/hate relationship. My mother came out of the camps questioning her faith. She will tell you now that if she was given a choice she wouldn\u2019t come back Jewish. My father loves temple and loves being surrounded by things that are familiar with him, he\u2019s -- he\u2019s -- he\u2019s traditional and a little bit old-fashioned in that sense, he doesn\u2019t like female cantors. He likes that good old solid, you know, Jan Pierce type of voice, that -- that brings him to his spiritual satisfaction. When I was diagnosed with cancer in -- breast cancer in aug -- in July, sorry, in July, I had my surgery in August, I didn't question why it happened to me, and I wasn\u2019t as angry at God as I have been about why my mother had to suffer through the Holocaust. I could accept my fate more easily and hopefully with more grace than I\u2019ve ever been able to accept what happened to my mother and her family. And so when it -- when I think in terms of blind faith, I don\u2019t have it. I know that Judaism is built upon equal parts of blind faith and questioning, so that you come to a -- a soulful Interview with Shelly Rothschild-Sherwin * March 15, 2001 understanding of your relationship in -- in the world, and with God as a Jew. And yet, the Holocaust puts a -- a huge roadblock that sometimes prevents me from attaining more spiritual insight. I\u2019ll never be able to get past that. Sometimes I have a very accusatory tone in my thoughts when my mother is suffering the way that she does. I never had a normal mother. I never experienced a mother without pain, without even the unspoken kind of neuroses that the Holocaust caused her to develop in her personality. She is an intellectually brilliant free spirit, and yet the Holocaust harnessed her intelligence and imprisoned her in this failing, tortured body. And so I\u2019ve been very angry at God for a long time."

I\u2019m the Hillel director, which is the Jewish student group, and create a program of activities, everything from virtual bowling to having intellectual, philosophical, ridiculous conversations. Activit -- all kinds of activities. These are college students and they\u2019re looking to have fun and they\u2019re looking to bond with their peers, and so I\u2019ve been doing that for 10 years.

And the other thing that keeps me very busy, because I do love writing, I -- and I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve free-lanced on a book, and I just enjoy the process of writing, is that I have a business with a partner for college admissions, we\u2019re college counselors. And I work both with high school students and then college graduates on their admission application essays. We help them from the entire creative process of formulating their ideas to the finished product of the essays. So it\u2019s a very creative and involving and sometimes nerve-wracking process, waiting for those acceptance letters to come. But it -- it keeps me very involved with students from high school age through graduate school students."

Since we had the chance to travel two years ago to Italy when my daughter was doing a study abroad, that re-sparked my wanderlust, which I had before I married my husband, and he has promised that he will take off some time and we\u2019re going to go back to Europe again. Museum trips are still a -- a very constant feature of life here in Los Angeles. Reading, I\u2019m a great reader, I always have. Music, I -- I keep a little bit of my youth in my tastes with -- still listening to the Beatles, but I find that classical music is more satisfying now as I\u2019m getting older, especially driving in LA traffic. And love my dog."
