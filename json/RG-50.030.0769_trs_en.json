And I and another guys were able to get some old guns. I had a old American western Colt, about this size.

And then, of course, we saw the four guys coming towards us, about 20 feet ahead of us, and they saw what was happening, so we started running. And they took the rifles off and started shooting at us, and we run up the embankment, and near the ghetto walls, and by the ghetto walls we got to downtown. And then, on the way back, we're told not to go through \u2014 near the station, because the German were arresting people left and right. And next day they killed 20 women and children on that spot.

They didn\u2019t take prisoners, they were killing them. Hospitals and everybody. So he took me there, and the whole city was in a flame. It was extremely hot and stinking, and I was given a anti-tank weapon, which I could hardly handle. And I was firing at one of the tanks, and I hit the tank, and the tank started firing. But there was another stan \u2014 tank standing by, and he saw the window from which I fired, and he turned the gun, and fired at my window. And just before he fired, I jumped out. This was second story. And I busted my leg \u2014 broke my leg."
