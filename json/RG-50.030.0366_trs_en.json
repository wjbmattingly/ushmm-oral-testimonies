So, after we did that, we took the, the pail in the toilet, you know, in the cabin, close up and get undressed and wash with this garbagy water. And then I had only one pair of pants. This was it. No bra or nothing. So, I would take off the pants, wash it in this water and guess what I would do. I was working at the, at the press. I would hang the pants under the table and the heat of the press would almost dry it. It was half dry. I would put it on again and this is the way I kept clean."

I was working for the commander and I had to go and buy pro -- get provisions for the commander and I did it. So, to the commander went a part and a part went to our house where all the ten of us were living. They had, I ate with the commandant, it was a group. And one day this -- Genneg(ph) was his name -- came home and he said there is a nunnery and they have men, they are all swollen up from hunger after the concentration camp. He's very sick and they don't have enough food for. So, my mother started to make packages. We had plenty of food and this Genneg took the bicycle and every day he delivered the food. Came a time when he comes and he says he's all right he's going back to Lodz and he wants you to, to write down your names and where you are and I said to my mother, so we write. He will throw it away some place. Mother says, \u201cBut it doesn't harm you to write it down,\u201d so we did. He went to L\u00e9dz, he put it at the town hall and my brother was there with a friend and the friend says, \"Look, this is your mother and Irene here.\u201d\u2019 He knew where to find us and he found us. This, this was he found us. The men survived and he was grateful and, and he gave me a chance to find my brother. And then my brother they, they started him to get involved, you know to translate and so on and I started and he told me that he heard that Bert was alive. He didn't know where but he knows he's alive. So, there is nothing for me to do here anymore, I'm going to look for him. Went to Berlin, got the papers because at that time -- Germany was divided already, English zone, American zone and so on -- got the papers and I brought over the first transport of people from Berlin to the English zone, 60 people of us. We come to Brunswick, this is two hours from Han-Hannover, I think a short distance from, and I am at the railroad station with Dora and I said -- my mother was left behind with my brother in this small town -- I said we have to get on this train no matter what. And as we talk a young man comes over and he recognized me and I said you know I heard that my, my husband is alive but I'm looking for him. So he says you know I have to tell you something. Your husband is an angel. Why? He was working in the town hall, Bert, voluntary, and this man, it was curfew after the war. Certain times you couldn't move around and you needed papers, identification. Bert wrote him out the papers and gave him everything and he wanted to give him money. So, Bert says when I do for someone a fa-favor I don't take pay for it and go and Gesundheit.\u201d\u00b0 I met this fellow at the railroad station and he told me where Bert was. I knew where he was. So, we got on this train at four in the morning. You know people were hanging on trains. You didn't have a regular, you know -- it was right after the war. We got there to Hannover and then the experience how we met it was just unbelievable. But it's a long story, too long. But we met. I found him."
