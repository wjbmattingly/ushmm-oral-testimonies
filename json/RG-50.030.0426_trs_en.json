I was waiting my friends, I was waiting my sister, | was waiting my brother, and I was staying there hours and hours. And I never forget this unhappy people who had not strength to walk or had not strength to live and we were helping there and giving them something, what we have, and we found, also, some friends from us, or we talked to neighbors, \"oh, your relative is here, please go and treat him\". But my sister didn't come. We got only a letter that she's alive, that she's very ill, that she's in Bergen- Belsen and after she went to and some English soldiers liberated her and an English doctor saved her life because she was very, very ill. And for many, many years, for about 40 years, I didn't like to think about it because after war, when I came home, I wanted to live normal. I didn't want to speak with many people about what happened to us. Also, some people told us, \"oh, why came you back, why didn't you stay there\", and it was very painful. I didn't like for 40 years to think very deeply about it because every time, when I started to think and to talk about what happened to us and to my friends and to my relatives, I was really ill about it. I was so, trembling and I wanted to live normal and to study normal and to work good, but something stayed. For example, I was so happy to be able to study, that they allowed me to study, that when I had students which didn't work, I was nearly furious. I told them, \"How you can dare not to work? You don't know that people, children or young people, couldn't learn anything, that they were in concentration camps\", and so on. And this was a very strong feeling for me because I was, everyday telling, thank you that I can live a normal life. And because I was every time so excited that, in that way about it, when I was speaking with somebody, I wanted to, didn't want to speak too much about it and I didn't visit Terezin 40 years after the war. And after the 40 years I found the strength and I went there with my son and it was very good that I went because I saw a nearly normal village. In the home where we were living, nobody wrote that we, that they were sometimes almost starving children and that this happened and this happened. And after, I told to me, oh, you cannot thinking in this way, you have to be quiet and only you can work for the future. That never will the same thing will happen to children and to people. And for this reason I am working in Terezin, 1n it's archive, in Prague, and I'm working also in my town, Berno (ph), in the staff of Jewish society."

And asking Him, \"why he is so cruel and he let these things to work?\" No, He didn't answer me. For this reason, I only was feeling that I am a member of a group of people that had the same destiny, and I was proud of this big tradition, this old tradition. I was proud that I was a Jewish and I told everybody that I am Jewish, but I didn't practice the religion. After, when my father died, I came a little bit back."
