We \u2122re interviewing Mr. Virgil Myers, who served in the 80th infantry division, Patton\u2122s third army, 317th regiment. Mr. Myers, can you briefly describe your childhood?",
            "answer": "I was \u0152 I was brought up on a farm, and I lived on a farm until I was 18 years of age, and then I began to work for Quaker Oats company, and to go to junior college at night. And I graduate d from the junior college, and then I was married at 20 years of age. And I still worked for Quaker Oats company. And I started to work for \u0152 I started to go to business college, which Quaker Oats paid for. And I graduated two years later, going to school at night, from business college. And I \u0152 my wife and I had a daughter a year and a half after we were first married. And so, the war came along. I was working at a job with Quaker, which was providing food for the military. And they deferred me one time for a year, then my name came up again, and I s-said well, I\u2122ll probably go this time. They said no, you have more important job here. And so they deferred me the second time. I was downtown one day and a la dy came by and she stopped me by pulling my arm. She said, are you in the military? And I said, no ma\u2122am, I work for Quaker Oats company. She said, well I have two sons and you look as healthy as they are. And I don\u2122t understand why that they\u2122re in the military and you\u2122re not. And that began to 4 worry me and to bear on my mind. And th e next time when my deferment come up, they asked me, and I said no, I don\u2122t want it. Which turned out to be a bad decision on my part, I thought many, many times during the war."

            "answer": "I entered it Saint Joseph \u0152 well, actually at Leavenworth, Kansas . I was inducted from Saint Joe, Missouri and went into the army in Leavenworth, Kansas. Was transferred from Leavenworth to Camp Hood, Texas. And I was one of the first groups that their training period was reduced from 18 weeks to 12 weeks. And we had 12 weeks of basic training, which really amounted to one day of looking at a weapon and being told what it was, the next day you would tear that weapon down, clean it and put it back together many, many times. The next day you would spend a half a day in a schoolroom, showing videos of how that weapon was used in combat. And then the next day you would go on a different weapon. And that\u2122s the way it was for the 12 weeks. And you learned to ha \u0152 you hadn\u2122t night problems that you would use that weapon fo r a half a day, and then you were on a different type of a weapon. At the end of, really the first week that we were there was just being assigned, getting our billets, getting our clothes, and everything. So when it come right down to it, you only had 10 weeks of basic training, because the last week you were there, they were givi ng you orders to go home, and then to where you were to go from there. So you \u0152 at the time I went through, you really only had 10 weeks of basic training. 5"

            "answer": "Of 1944, and I came home for 10 days furlough. Then I was sent to Fort Mead, Maryland and we got on a ship, the \u0152 th-the \u0152 the first part of September of 1944. And from there we went to Liverpool, England , which took us 10 days to go across the ocean in a c \u0152 big convoy. And then we landed in Liverpool, we got off of one boat, walked down the dock, got on another boat, or ship, and went across the channel. And I got off at Omaha Beach on the 27th of September. Went up on the hill at Omaha Beach, which at that time was a replacement center. They had two men tents there. And each t \u0152 and it rained every hour that we were on Omaha Beach, and they would tell \u0152 they told us when we were assigned to our tent, there is a bulletin board right down here. You look at that bulletin board at least once every four hours because your name will appear and you will be deployed from here to some unit. We had no idea where we were going to be deployed. On the second afternoon, they \u0152 we went to the bulletin board, and my name and elethe \u0152 and eleven other names were on th e bulletin board, and we were told to load on a truck at 12 o\u2122clock and at 12 o\u2122cloc k we \u0152 12 of us loaded on , and there was a sergeant on the truck. He says, I will be in charge of you until you reach the deployment area where you\u2122ll be assigned. Six hours later we ended up at Pont A Mousson, France 6 on the Moselle river. And the 80th \u0152 and when we got ther e, we actually unloaded on the west side of the river. And a first sergeant by the name of Percy Smith came up, and he was just a small fellow, about five foot six, smoking a big stogie. And he said, I want you fellows to know that you have just been assigned to Company G, of 317, the fightingest damned outfit in the United States Army. Well, maybe they all told us that, I don\u2122t know. But that was our approach when we first reached there. Lined up, he got our names, our serial numbe r, and he said, is there anyone here that has ever fired a 60 millimeter mortar? And Ken Mauer (ph), who happened to have taken basic training in Fort Hood with me, was in the same group that I was in, which is a miracle for two people to be, but we were replacements. At that time we found out that the 80th had taken a lot of casualties, and that they needed replacements. So Percy said, you see that bunch of trees about three blocks down there? We said yes. He said, there\u2122s a sergeant by the name of Fadinas (ph). You report to him, and he\u2122s really gonna be glad to see you, because he lost five of his squad yesterday in an artillery barrage. So, that was our re \u0152 first experience to being near combat situation. And so we were assigned to the Company G, near Dieulouard, France on the 29 th or 30th of September of 1944."

And he had gotten his citizenship by volunteering to come into the United States Army when he was 18 years old. And at that time he was about 20. And so, he was a very dedicated American soldier, but he hated the Germans with a passion, because his parents and his grandparents both had been eliminated by the SS in Russia."

            "answer": "My first personal experience was the next day. We were to take a labor camp on the east side of the Moselle river. We had then, after we landed, we went across the river near Saint Genevieve. And Company G was near Saint Genevieve, France, and we were to take ov \u0152 a Polish labor camp that was supposed to be in some woods, that were just beyond where we were. Well, as we started out, we started through these woods, and the Germans laid in an artillery barrage. And I can remember that Ken and I were so na\u00efve, that we were standing there and saying, oh look, that artillery shell hit that tree and knocked the whole top out of it. Because we\u2122d never seen anything like that. And we were \u0152 were talking about how the shells were knocking the limbs off of these trees, never thinking about that we could get hit ourself. Well, after they k \u0152 shot about 12 shells, it seemed that the Germans would traverse to another area, and our lieutenant said, c\u2122mon fellows, let\u2122s go. 8 Well, we got up and we started and we walked about 50 yards. And here was the fellow laying on the ground with the medics, and he had the top of his helmet and his head completely cut off with a piece of shrapnel. And I looked, and it was one of the fellows that rode up on the truck w ith me. Here\u2122s a guy that just got into combat, didn\u2122t even have his rifle off his shoulder, and was killed before we even got started. Well, the next time that shells started exploding in trees around us, Ken and I were the first ones to stick our heads into the root s of the trees, because we didn\u2122t want that to happen to us. And it was a very vivid experience of finding out what happens in combat, in a hurry. But we took that labor camp that day, and freed about 40 Polish labor \u0152 laborers out of a camp that were providing labor for an electrical company in the area of Pont A Mousson."

And we didn\u2122t even have an assignment before we came up that day before. And we were mortar men, and had had two days experience on a mortar before we came up to that i \u0152 to that day."

And so then we came back to the area of Saint Genevieve, and we then were assigned, our 10 next objective was to take a village and a road junction at Sivry, which was about 10 miles east of the area that we were at that time. Now, you understand that companies of infantrymen, one company wi ll take an area and go forward. There will be two companies that usually will go forward, and one company in reserve. That next day we were in reserve. These other two companies had gone forward from Dieulouard east into France. And then we were brough t up from reserve, and said your objective is to take this little village of Sivry, s-i-v-r-y, France. There is a road junction there that the Ge-Germans are using that comes down from the mountains of s \u0152 of Saint \u0152 Saint Jane , and Saint Mihiel , and coming down and furnishing supplies to the Germans up around Metz. So we want to cut that road off. We went into the little village of Sivry , set up our road blocks, never had a fire \u0152 shot fired at us. We went into this little village, dug our foxholes, set up our defenses in our \u0152 our area. At midnight th at night, the Germans started firing from the mountains. Now, these are not peaks, these are big hills. They had set up their artillery and mortars on top of these two big hills that overlooked this valley, and at midnight they started firing on Company G because we were the only ones in this village at that time. And there\u2122s about 75 houses and a big church in this village. By daybreak there was not one building in that little village that was still standing. We went in that village that day, short of our component of [indecipherable] we had 169 men. And they shelled us every time a nybody would move outs ide of a foxhole. They let us dig in, the oth \u0152 that afternoo n before, and never fired on us. But that 11 night they started firing on that field, a nd the village. And by the next morning, all those houses were completely flat. And they kept firing all morning. The afternoon fog moved in, and it began to get dark abou t 4:30 in the afternoon and we got notice to pull out. Out of the 159, the daily report of Company G shows that 40 men walked out, and back up over the hill that night. Now, I don\u2122t know that all of them got killed. We know that about 38 of them got captured in that village, but the rest of them were injured, and that was \u0152 that was my first day of real combat, and you can become an experienced person of combat in a very short time."

            "answer": "Yes. On \u0152 we were near Saint Avold, France , near a little \u0152 in a little village called Gunwaller(ph), and we had just finished the battle of Farebersviller on November the 27th, through the 29th. And we had come up to Saint Avold, and were in reserve. And we were there and we notice of a m \u0152 and about nine o\u2122clock in the morning, there will be trucks here at 12 o\u2122clock to load us up, because we\u2122re gonna take a trip up to Luxembourg. Well, nobody knew where the heck Luxembourg was. We didn\u2122t \u0152 had never heard of it even . And so we, after \u0152 on the way up there, well, we got talking about it and trying to figure out what we were gonna do. We had heard that the Germans had broke throug h up there, and that we were supposed to go up and support the troops that were up there. Well, it\u2122s about 125 miles from Saint Avold up to where we were going. And that evening, or that night, we ended up just east of Luxembourg city at Gonderange, between Gonderange and 12 Junglinster. And the next morning we got notice, Company G was to be transferred, and we got in trucks and went up over \u0152 they call them mountains, we call them big hills here \u0152 they went over the big hill to Steinsul (ph), a village of Steinsul(ph). And from Steinsul(ph) we went to the west. He wa \u0152 he ended up in Mersch where headquarters company, but we were west of Mersch on the mountain west and going dow n the ridge north towards Ettelbruck. And we walked all evening, and up to about 10 o\u2122clock at night, and we found a big barn, and it was sn \u0152 it was beginning to sleet. And they put us up \u0152 we all got into that barn, and laid down and slept til the next morning. But we could hear gunfire during the night, so we knew that we were getting clos e to the \u0152 the front. But it was still about five miles north before we ran into any activity at all, which was just west of Ettelbruck. And from there we went to Niederfeulen, and we were at Niederfeulen and then it began to snow and got co ld as hell. Cold as hell. And the next day would have been the 23 rd \u0152 well, we were in Niederfeulen a couple a \u0152 a couple of days, and then we were supposed to go north of Niederfeulen to Bourscheid and Walscheid and Kehmen . And as we went up the ridge, and got just south of Kehmen, they opened fire on us, and we didn\u2122t realize it, but they had a mountain to the east and north of that area, that they could see the whole area, it \u0152 it was like open country to them, and they could see us. And that was where what was called Bloody Ridge, today, yet today to the Luxembourg people, because we were tied down there for two days, and took severe \u0152 317 took severe casualties all 13 that two days, because every time anybody got out of a foxhole, they would get shot at, because they could see them from across the valley from that mountain in the woods where they had their artillery and mo rtars dug in. And that\u2122s what most of it was, was shrapnel from artillery, and it would hit the frozen ground, and it would just skip, and hit people, if you were e xposed. And from there \u0152 we were there two days. They drew us back, and then we went into Hiderscheid(ph), and into \u0152 we went into Hiderscheid(ph), and replaced \u0152 319 had been in, that was another regiment of the 80 th, and they \u0152 they pulled out and moved farther west, towards Bastogne, and we then replaced them at Hiderscheid(ph). And we got counterattacked that first night, and then we were able to save that. And then our objective was to go across the \u0152 it\u2122s the cliff river in that area that goes on down. But from there, we were on the front side of that mountain, near Tadler and Ringel and all that area, for almost two weeks, right in that area, because they were across the valley firing back at us, and hell, we couldn\u2122t move. We \u0152 every time we \u0152 we would move \u0152 plus the fact that supplies, we didn\u2122t have supplies, and then on the 21st of January, we had \u0152 our objective was to start from Ringel to go down the valley and up over the mountain to Bourscheid, and to help to take Bourscheid. I was in what was called the weapons plato on, the fourth platoon, and I had 26 men that morning. And Captain Namkowitz(ph), who was the company commander said, Myers, take your men and \u0152 a nd \u0152 and along with Heizer (ph) and his machine gun, you fellows walk up the \u0152 the fire alley in the forest, because, he said, you can 14 carry your weapons, we don\u2122t need you til you get to the top. Well, we didn\u2122t know it, but they had an 88 dug in up at the top, and there was 15 to 18 inches of snow on the ground, and it was 18 below zero that mo rning, and \u0152 or that afternoon. As we walked up the hill \u0152 now, out of my squad that \u0152 that day, of 12 men, I had nine men that had just come up, because they were new replacements, just \u0152 and I \u0152 I was an old man then, because I\u2122d had from October, November, December, so I had 90 days of experience of \u0152 of that. I was 26 years old, and everybody wanted to get into my squad because I was the oldest man there. And they thought that because I was older that I was \u0152 I was \u0152 maybe could keep them safe. Well, tha-that didn\u2122t ha \u0152 that wasn\u2122t the way it was in combat. You just were lucky wherever you were. But anyway, I had young men, inexperienced, and as the 88 started firing down the firepath at us, they started running. We kept hollering, drop in the snow, drop in the snow. Well, they didn't do it. They ran to get into the trees. And the Germans had wire traps all up the hill, with bouncing Betty booby traps that were half gallon bucket size, s-syrup bucket size, that would jump 40 inches in the air and explode, and they were filled with shrapnel. And they were devastating. Well, when we started to run, Heizer (ph) and I hit the ground in th e center of the firepath, in the snow. They were running, they hit these, and out of the 26 men, 22 of them got \u0152 were casualties. And that afternoon, that \u0152 after that afternoon, four o\u2122clock they called off the \u0152 the advance. About the fi \u0152 si \u0152 third or fourth shell that that 88 fired, tanks started firing at that 88 and finally knocked it out. But that was \u0152 we 15 only had about four or five shells from that 88, and that was all because they knocked it out. But that evening, there were so many casualties in G Company, that that evening, not only in G Company, but in the second battalion going up that hill, that when they called it off, they\u2122ve all had \u0152 called for volunteers of 22 men from the company, and two officers to carry the casualties to \u0152 back towards Ringel, so they could be put in trucks and into ambul ances to be taken back to the first aid. And that day, after that day, gi \u0152 G Company had less than 50 men in \u0152 in it that day, and we were attached then for three more days to another company, because we were declared inoperative. So, until we could get more replacements up, why, we were attached to another company a nd that \u0152 that was one day that you don\u2122t forget."

            "question": "Okay, so it was infantry.",
            "answer": "It was infantry. And they came up and all of us, each regiment had an armored unit attached to it, like the 307. Three \u0152 307 tank battalion was attached to the second battalion of 317. But th ree wee \u0152 actually, 317 as we came \u0152 we had been in Erfurt for three days fighting. And then we started and came to Weimar, and it\u2122s only 10 miles to Weimar from Erfurt. And when we got to Erfurt, why 319 was 17 ahead of us, and 317 was in reserve. They call it reserve, we were held \u0152 we were all like a mile back of them, so that if they got in trouble, why we could be deployed up to help them. But we stopped and we sat there for \u0152 for quite a \u0152 for about three or four hours. And finally, why they gave the message to the mayor to surrender the city, and he and a lady on a bicycle came out with a white flag, and they surrendered the city. So, 319 went around th e city, 317, with the second battalion, came into Weimar and we were the only ones that was in Weimar from the 80th division actually, because 319 skirted it and went around, and 318 followed them. 317 was left in reserve so that we could \u0152 our \u0152 ou-our assignment was to do police work and keep control of the city. And that\u2122s what we did. 317, the three \u0152 the second battalion walked right down th e main street from the west, into Weimar. As we walked down the street, we were on both sides of the street, about five, 10 yards apart, each one of us, as we got downtown, the civilians that were on the street as we walked by, would turn th eir back to us and face the walls of the stores, and wouldn\u2122t look at us. Wouldn\u2122t look at us at all. But the kids, the kids would run out and say, have you got any gumy (ph), gumy (ph), gumy (ph) chocolate. And so they were just like kids back home . And when we got downtown, to Weimar, we went down to the plaza that is right in the center of town by the city hall, and company G, Captain Namkowitz (ph) set his headquarters up in a building right down on the \u0152 on the square. So he signed all the different ones. I had to s-set up on a street with my mortars, near the railroad station, so that I could see down the railroad tracks, in 18 case that a train come, or something like that. So, we were there. We kept seeing these people who were in striped suits. Not many, but we would see them once in awhile, walk by. Finally Captain Namkowitz(ph) told Percy Smith, who was the first sergeant of G Company, he said, Percy, he says, you take down Smith the Jeep driver in a Jeep and get Myers , and you guys go see if you can find out where the hell these guys are coming from. He said, wa \u0152 where are they coming from? He said, we\u2122d see \u0152 they must be a \u0152 a prison, or a jail around here that they\u2122re getting out of. So, we started, a nd we asked four different civilians, where are these prisoners? Nix(ph), nixt (ph), we don\u2122t know, we don\u2122t know. They didn\u2122t know where they were coming from. Well, we went down to the railroad st \u0152 track, or down by the station and sa w two boys that were about 10 - 12 years old. Percy could speak a little bit of German, and Percy got out of the Jeep and he went over to these boys, he said, where are these prisoners coming from? And they said, oh, way out on the hill, way up on a hill, way out in the country. So, we started to drive out in that direction. We drove for about four miles, and we thi \u0152 and we got to talking, we said, you know, those damn kids , they \u0152 they\u2122ve given us bad direction, there can\u2122t be anything out here, and we still didn\u2122t see it. But we were on a country, a dirt road that had been traveled a lot. So, Don said, well, we\u2122ll just follow this up around the hill. So we went up around the hill, and then right at the top of this hill, here was a 10 foot wire fence. Guys were just leaning against it, just looking. We drove up to the gate, and we didn\u2122t know what it was. We saw all these 19 buildings. Now, at the wi \u0152 at that time, we didn\u2122t realize that we were at the back gate of Buchenwald , which was down by where the museum is now. But there was a fence all around that area on the west side of the camp, and we came up on the west side of the camp. And Percy got out and he asked the guy, he said, what is this place, anyway? And the guy says, ein minute, ein minute. He goes into a barracks and comes out with a little fellow that was five foot six. Skinny? God, he didn\u2122t weigh 70 pounds, he didn\u2122t weigh 60 pounds. He said, my name is so and so, and I am from Lithuania. He said, I\u2122ve been in this camp for four years. He could speak English, very good English. He said, I been in this camp for four years, and he said, this is Buchenwald work camp. Percy said, work camp, what the hell is a work camp? He said, well, we furnish \u0152 he said, they come here and this is a big camp. He said, there\u2122s other little camps all around, at the industries and out in the farms, that furnish labor from here. And he said \u0152 Percy said, well, who\u2122s in charge here? He said, well, the SSers were until last night, and they heard that you were headed this way, and, he said, they ran. He sa id, there was about 3,000 of them here. We said, 3,000? And he said yes, he said, there was approximately 3,000 here before you came here. He said, how many people are in this camp, anyway? Well, we could see \u0152 now, where we came in, there were low one, just one story buildings that looked like they had been put up in a hurry. They had just \u0152 I don\u2122t know whether it was straw board, or what, but it wasn\u2122t \u0152 it \u0152 it was \u0152 looked like temporary buildings. And so he said, this camp here, is \u0152 is the west part \u0152 he said, 20 the main gate is over there. Well, we didn\u2122t know that there was a name \u0152 main gate. And later on, we found out that other people from 317 had come in on the front side of the gate. But he said, there was some guys here yesterday in a motorized vehicle, kind of like a tank, but he said, they didn\u2122t even come in. They just were here for a short time, and he sa id, they left. And we said, well, what did you have to \u0152 what ar e you eating? And he said, well, he said, the SSers had some potato peelings that they had peeled yest erday and threw in the dump, and he said, we got them and washed them, and then, he said, we went over there and got green grass and brought over and put in with that, and he said, that\u2122s all we\u2122ve had to eat today. So, we went inside the camp, just to the first row of buildings, and in front of the barracks, they had people laying out, and Percy says, what happened to them? Oh, they just died. They just died. And about that time, here come six guys pulling a two wheel cart up from around the corner, down below. And they were picking these dead guys up and putting them on this two wheel cart. And I don\u2122t know what they were doing with them wh en they got them, you know. But Percy said, well, I don\u2122t remember was Percy, me or Don said, what do they do with them? Well, he says, they have a cremator \u0152 had \u0152 they ha ve an oven up there. An oven? Yeah, he said, they burn them. He said, they burn the bodies. Well, come find out they had two crematories there with four ovens in each building, and they worked them 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And \u0152 so Percy said, how many people are here? He said, well, we think there is about 26,000 here now. And Percy said, who\u2122s in 21 charge? Well, we have a committee that\u2122s in charge, but, he said, really nobody\u2122s in charge. He said, a bunch of them took off after the SSers. He said, they broke into the armament, and they are after the SSers now. And he said, we\u2122ve got ninet \u0152 now I\u2122m \u0152 I \u0152 I might be wrong, but he said \u0152 I think that he said, we have 19 of them locked up on the other side in a building. And so Percy and I and Don went back to town and Captain Namkowitz (ph), we told him what we \u2122d found. He said, well, I\u2122m going to call division and tell them what\u2122s there. So they said, well, we\u2122ll have some trucks with some food and blankets and medicine up there tomorrow. So, I was assigned with my five man \u0152 six man, I was assigned from the 13 th, the 14th and up until about noon on the 15th to go around and pick up these guys that were in \u0152 sstraggling in town, and to take them back out to camp for \u0152 so that they could get medicine. And some of the fellows didn\u2122t wa nt to go back out to camp. But we told them that they were gonna be food out there, the best we could. Tried to tell them, but we had one fellow that was at the edge of town, and he came out of a house eating a potato that must have weighed a po und. And he was just eating that thing just like it was a candy bar. He walked out to \u0152 almost to where our je \u0152 truck was \u0152 Jeep, and he fell over. Well, we picked him up, put him in the Jeep and took him back out to the camp, and Dr. Bob out there, he was our battalion medic, he was out there and by that time they had set up some medics also that had got there. And he said, this poor guy, he didn\u2122t weigh 60 po unds. He said, this poor guy was e \u0152 we told him what happened, and he said, well, probably the starch in the potato was just 22 too much for his system and he just can\u2122t ha ndle it, he just couldn't handle it. So, on the 15th, then, I was r \u0152 they \u0152 I was relieved by \u0152 now, I \u0152 I think it was people \u0152 fellows from a cavalry that replaced us, bu t by that time then, our headquarter, our company headquarters had moved, and we went to Gina(ph). Gina (ph) was east of there, and so we went to Gina(ph) from \u0152 from there."

The guys never \u0152 they just looked by us when we were in there. Now, some of them, four or five trailed along with us, as we were walking in there. But other than that, they were so sick. And I didn\u2122t realize it until this year, when we were in Weimar and was talking to fellows that were in the camp, that the backside of Buchenwald was called the death camp. That when they had people that were so sick and so emancipated that they thought they were gonna die, they would bring them back to that part of the camp and \u0152 and 23 put them there. They asked me in the evening if I would tell about finding the camp and what I had seen and such as this. One fellow, afterwards he said, he was in the cr \u0152 in the group, and he held his hand up, and I said, yes, sir? He said, what you have just said, I can verify every word, because, he said, I was a 16 year old Jewish boy that had typhus fever, that they had pu t me into the death camp. I said, what do you mean death camp? He said, that\u2122s what that part of the camp was called. If they expected you to die in the next four or fi ve days. And he said, I was destined to be eliminated in four or five days, but yo u guys came along, and saved my life. And I said no, the SSers were gone. We didn\u2122t save you, we \u0152 we just happened to come up there. He said no, they knew that you were coming and they left. So, he said, I want to come up and shake your hand. And he did, and he started crying, and so did I. And so, he said, my na me is \u0152 my name is Klein. He said, I have been an American citizen for over 45 years and I\u2122m a r \u0152 a \u0152 a Jewish rabbi in California.

And I said, no, we didn\u2122t. But, I said \u0152 he said, well, as far as I\u2122m concerned, you did, because the next da y I was in a hospital in Gina(ph), and two days after that, I was in England , and he said, then I was sent to the United States to completely recover, and that\u2122s where I\u2122ve stayed."

The boat would go up and come down and hunks of enamel or paint would pop off of the side of the boat, like that.

That\u2122s what I thought, I really did, but boy. But after five days it \u0152 it began to smooth out. We came into New York and set outside of New York harbor for four hours in the dark and we couldn\u2122t figure out why. Well, they waited until daybreak to take us by the Statue of lemer \u0152 of Liberty. And man, everybody \u0152 everybody was crying and f \u0152 happy and hollering and everything. And hello statue, and they all laughed, and it was \u0152 it was a very happy time. It was just wonderful. And then they unloaded us at New York, took us over to Camp Kilmer and from Camp Kilmer they took us into a big assembly hall, the first thing. When we got off of the train, we marched into there.

I said, what can I tell you? She said, well \u0152 I said, why don\u2122t you have your history teacher write me down so me things that she would like for me to cover? So she did.

And the year before my wife got sick, and I had to kind of quit this for awhile, I talked to 46 different schools in one year, about World War II, and the Battle of the Bulge, and this, and I bring it up to them, that if your parents aren\u2122t voting, then you keep on them, and make sure that they vote for someone, and to study their \u0152 what they stand for before you let them go. And don\u2122t let them say, well, I don\u2122t have time.

And the Senate rescinded their authority and let him have a one man decision on all questions, problems and answers to what he thinks that ger \u0152 is best for Germany. The first thing he did, so the people tell me, was after he got this authority, was to eliminate everyone that disagreed with him, by building up hate within the people for a specific problem that Hitler wanted to get rid of. That was religion, God, and his en emies. And he was successful in getting the Senate to relinquish their power and to give it to him. But in the new constitution of Germany, they no longer have that authority to relinquish that power to one person. It must stay in a vote in Germany. So I was told in Weimar this time, because I ask them."
