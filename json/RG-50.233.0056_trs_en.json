    "header": "3Interview with Irene Hizme and Rene Slotkin April 12, 1992 Oceanside, New York R: My name is Rene Slotkin. This is now Ap ril, 1992. I was born Rene Guttman [Gutman] in 1937 in Tepice-Sanov (Teplitz Schoenau) which is in Czechoslovakia (Czech Republic). What is your specific birth date? R: December 21, 1937. And I am not sure how long we actually lived \u0152 or how long I stayed in Tepice-Sanov, but my first recoll ection is living in Prague. Um\u2013 Irene, you have something? I: Oh sure. My name is Irene Hizme and I was Renatta (Renate) Guttman, I was born the same day and I am a half an hour older than Rene. Um\u2013I don\u2122t remember Teplice-Sanov but I do remember Prague and we lived upstairs in an apartment. We had a terrace\u0160 it overlooked a yard, um\u2013I don\u2122t think it was a very big apartment. I kind of rememb er a lot of things being in one room. Um\u2013 our crib \u0152 we slept in a crib \u0152 and it was in the room where our parents\u2122 bed was as well. And someplace down always was a tabl e. That\u2122s kind of all I remember. There was a long flight of stairs to get upstairs. R: Yeah, the staircase \u0152 I remember that too. \u201aC ause I remember falling on the stairs once and cutting my chin and having a burning sensation when I was treated for it. And, lo and behold, years after, after the war when I first remembered this, I looked and there is a little scar there. You recently took a trip where you recall a certain streetcar or a trolley? R: Well, after the war, I return ed to Prague because\u0160 because we had some friends who had some documents and pictures of us when were much younger, before the war with our parents. I do remember then seeing a trolley car with th e number 22. I didn\u2122t know what was 22 at the time but the image is 2-2. We followed the routes of the tram at that time \u0152 number 22 \u0152 and I was able to locate this particular apartment building a nd it turned out to be the right one, so that was a bit exciting. But even more exciting was being able to, at the time, to get \u0152 this must have been in 1948 \u0152 just before I started my trek to the Unite d States, to be able to get actual pictures of myself and Irene and my parents together. It sort of really gave me some roots for the first time ever\u0160 something tangible to be able to look at and know that I had a beginning and parents like everyone else. I: I have very sporadic memories of our chil dhood, but I do remember that we were beautifully clothed. We had beautiful clothing \u0152 matc hing outfits. You know there was always\u0160 I remember, particularly, we had these um\u2013 you know\u0160 not these, with bells on them so our mom could hold us with like a leash. Not a leas h, but you know what I\u2122m talking about\u0160 I don\u2122t know how you call that\u0160 how do you call that? 4A harness\u0160 I: A harness. And they had these little bells on them. I remember that very clearly. I remember also very often going to a park which must have been near our home, with our parents. And most vividly, I remember, one time there was a huge storm and we went to the park afterwards and all these trees had fallen down and we were climbing \u0152 you know like kids do \u0152 on them, walking along the trees\u0160 it was really a lot of fun. R: The pictures are of us, our parents and ourselves in the park. I: We even have pictures in the park. And I reme mber \u0152 this is just something that came to my head \u0152 I remember candy that we used to get. Like a marmalade, um\u2013 it\u2122s like the Passover candy that they used to make. You know those je lly\u2013 jelly kind of candies. I remember that for some strange reason. Do you remember what they tasted like? I: Yeah, kind of orangey. That was weird, I just\u2013 we also had, we had a certain number of toys. And we used to play upstairs in the apartment, the one specif ically I remember, we had punches (ph 058) like conductors on a train and we would play train a lot and we would punch the tickets. And I also remember having a doll, which Rene very nicely threw down from the balcony and smashed to smithereens. Yes. Was that one of those celluloid dolls from the time or\u2013 I: Yeah\u2013 R: It was big. I: Yeah, a big doll. R: From that period, what I remember is being in the yard of this building and stepping on a bee\u0160 I: Yeah, he was bitten\u0160 R: And I was bitten by a bee and even now, when I think about it, my foot starts itching. I: Yeah, right on the bottom of your foot, I remember th at so clearly, it\u2122s funny. Did they take you to a hospital or was it ju st taken care of at home, do you remember? R: I think it was just taken care of the way you would take care of a bite today. 5I: And the other thing I remember so clearly, is when mom used to put us to bed, we played kind of a game. She would put our hands in a certain order and we would see if we could wake up in the same position. Do you remember that? R: No. I: I remember that. So you shared a crib? I: Yes, we shared a crib. You were on the\u2013 right. What have you learned now in terms of what your father did, in terms of his occupation? R: My father was in the export/import business a nd I think this somehow le d to his accusation of being a spy\u0160 because I imagine that he had deal ings with foreign countries. He was originally from Germany, the whole family is from Germany so this is what he was accused of, and I think on the basis of that he was jailed and sent to the camps. My mother I don\u2122t know. I: Our mom, she also worked, she was very good in math, so I think she had something equivalent to possibly an accounting job, which of course, once laws that you couldn\u2122t hire Jews came about, you know she was laid off. But she did have a good job. Do you know if you were a fairly well-off family or typical middle class or\u2013? R: I can only judge by the clothing that we wore from the photographs we have, we can show you. We seem very well dre ssed and our parents also. I: I think\u2013by that time, our parents had fled fr om Dresden to Czechoslovakia where we were born, but I think our aunts from Dr esden kept sending us clothes. It was our aunt that sent us clothes. Because our parents could not buy anythi ng. Because by then our father was out of work and so was our mom. R: In other words, after we left Germany\u0160 when they left Germany, that was the whole down\u2013 I: Yeah, they no longer had any source of support and it was our aunt that sent\u2013 When did they leave Germany? I: Well we were born in \u212237 so it must have been around then. I see. I: There are a series of letters between their father and the aunt in Germany\u0160 about ten letters that we have, describing the children\u2122s behavior and how\u2013 6R: Yeah, that is terrific to have. I: Memories for the future\u2013 they are wonderful. They\u2122re in German. You don\u2122t know specifically what your father imported and exported? R: No. But he was arrested in Czechoslovakia, I see. Do you have any recollections of his being taken or\u2013 I: I do. I definitely do, again, not clearly but, one night, there was a knock on the door, a very loud knock\u0160 and there were soldiers who had come and they came to take our father away. I remember our mom was crying. We didn\u2122t know wh at happened. It was late at night and we never saw him again after \u0152 at least I don\u2122t\u2013 R: I just remember what she sai d. It was a disturbing event, it did happen but that\u2122s about it. About how old were you at the time? R: I would say four. And are you the only children of your parents. No brothers or sisters? (Silence on the tape for a few seconds) Any other memories that you would like to talk about? I: Something in the letters, maybe? I can\u2122t recall th e letters. I do remember at some point that we used to stand on line to get food\u0160 I sort of remember that. Um\u2013 the people stood on line. Do you know if your family was religious? I: I have no recollection. R: None. Did relatives ever come to visit you in Czechoslovakia, that you recall? R: No I: I do remember once though, that in the summer , it must have been summertime, I don\u2122t know when, but we went someplace where there was wate r, like a beach. That\u2122s all I can remember. R: It would have to be a lake. I: Maybe a lake, I don\u2122t know but I remember being\u2013 7R: I don\u2122t remember it. See what thirty minutes makes? A big difference. One of those memories\u2013(everyone laughs). Well, you have good recollections of being injured (to Rene). What do you recall about the changes in Prague or changes in your life once the Germans occupied? Or what is th e first significant memory you ha ve of a real change in your lifestyle? I: My first significant memory is waiting to get on this train to go someplace. It was a nice train though, you know it was like a sleeper or something, with windows. R: I think that was Theresienstadt that we were going to. I remember too, chronologically speaking, that is the next memory after. Because the previous memories, it wasn\u2122t a good life\u2013 a good existence, I don\u2122t think. I: Umm, it was, I think I\u2013 as a child, I sensed something was not right but\u2013 R: That\u2122s right, that\u2122s what I\u2122m saying. I: Our mother was rather sad. R: \u201aCause I don\u2122t remember my father, obviously my mother\u0160 she would have to have been sad. I: I remember a certain sadness, but the next thing, as I said, was really this train ride to someplace else to live. R: That was Theresienstadt. I: That was Theresienstadt. Do you remember taking anythi ng with you, in particular? I: Well, we did have some stuff but\u2013 I\u2013 this is\u2013 I\u2013 the only thing I recall is that I had a locket. I had a locket that I\u2013 a heart, and I re member having that for a long time even when I arrived in Auschwitz and I was very brazen. We would stand on line for the showers and we would have to strip naked and I had enough presence of mind to know that I had to take this thing off and I would hold on to it. I don\u2122t know how I did it, but I did it. I lost the locket however, somewhere. What did the locket look like? I: It was a heart shaped locket. It had pictures inside of it\u0160 I don\u2122t recall. This was a gift from your mother? I: It must have been, probably. You don\u2122t recall taking a toy with you or umm\u2013? R: The only thing I remember was my mother\u2122s shoulder and the texture of the dress that she wore. 8On that day, or\u2013? R: Not on that day, but from Theresienstadt. Th at\u2122s one of the things \u0152 since you asked us something tangible \u0152 this is what I do reme mber. And I think there was a picture taken\u0160 I: Picture taken of us\u0160 R: Picture was taken of us at that point in time and\u0160 I: We have the picture. R: Yeah, we got the picture and you know, it confirms this shoulder that I was leaning on. We have it right here. And, but I don\u2122t remember taking anything with me, like a personal toy or anything like that. No, I don\u2122t. So you remember how her dress felt? R: Yeah, it was coarse\u2013 I: But I do remember that our mom did carry a bag with something. That I remember but I don\u2122t know what was in it really. Do you remember anything about the train journey itself, and getting to the train station outside Theresienstadt? I: Actually, the train ride was kind of\u2013 I don\u2122t know, I enjoyed it. I think it was maybe our first train ride. It was a pretty nice trai n ride. It wasn\u2122t bad, as I recall, that trip to Theresienstadt. R: I have a blank on that. You do? You don\u2122t remember the march to Theres ienstadt? What are your first memories of Theresienstadt? I: Unfortunately, I think I have very minima l memories of Theresienstadt. Again, only, I remember cobblestone roads, pavements, brick bu ildings, I always see these bridges over water, I don\u2122t know if it\u2122s from there, I don\u2122t know, but that comes to mind. Were you staying with your mother there? Were you still with her? R: Yes, yes. I remember you being sick ther e (to Irene). I: It\u2122s possible, I was sick a lot\u2013 R: Over there, I do remember you being ill. Was she taken away to the hospital in the camp or\u2013 R: To some infirmary but she didn\u2122t stay overn ight or anything. She would just go there and come back. I: And in Theresienstadt, I also remember standing on line and I remember the carts with dead bodies. 9R: Yeah and on the cobblestone too. I: They just\u2013 yeah. R: Hard pushing, the wheels would get stuck between these rocks and everything would come to a halt and they would have to get everybody on the si de to get this thing started again, rolling and they lost a few bodies every once in a while, that rolled off. I: Umm\u2013 Do you recall what your day to day life was like there? Did you\u2013 there was an underground school. Do you recall ever getting taught\u2013 I: I can\u2122t recall. I think we were too young for the school. I am not sure we attended. But I don\u2122t know. R: I don\u2122t recall. I: I don\u2122t recall it at all. Well recently, there was a film made about Theresienstadt and in the film footage, which we saw in the Village just this year, there was a kindergarten, and on the bottom steps I spotted Rene in the film, so he was pa rt of the kindergarten group, whether they were active or not. It was part of the Nazi propaganda film footage. Oh, I see. I: I don\u2122t recall. R: I don\u2122t recall either. It is possible. I: It is possible. And I don\u2122t know if you recall this, I don\u2122t know if it\u2122s an ____ (?? ph 14) time for me, but at one point, do you remember standing in a field, just for hours and hours on end, I don\u2122t know for what. No? It is just something that is kind of flitting in and out of my head lately, but I can\u2122t exactly recall\u2013 R: I remember something, it was fields, it was dar k, was dark and I think we were waiting for the train to Auschwitz. I: No that\u2122s a different\u2013 R: That\u2122s a different\u2013 \u201aCause I remember taking quite a walk towards that train. I: Oh yeah, I remember that too, but that, no, this was just a lot of people were there and we were just kind of standing around waiting. Well that did happen. There was an occurrence li ke that where many people were taken out of the camp and held in a field, in a fo rest outside of Theresienstadt. I: Really? Yeah, so this is what I have read and what I have heard from other survivors. R: And what was the purpose of that? 10Well actually, last night Inge Auerbacher talked about that too, for what she remembered, she was an older child, that it looked as though th ey had plans to kill everybody. You know, she put it, \ufb01Babi Yar style,\ufb02 you know, shoot people into mass graves, but it didn\u2122t materialize for some reason \u0152 luckily \u0152 and everyone went back to the camp, back to Theresienstadt, so that might have been\u0160 it might be that you recall. I: Hmm. Well, on occasion, that is how they handl ed epidemics. There was some kind of disease and they couldn\u2122t handle it, well that would be their medical solution. And actually, before the film, they did depor t many people also, before they filmed the propaganda movie. Because they knew that it was too crowded. Do you remember if your mother was with you all day or did she leave you during the days as if to go to some kind of labor detail? R: I don\u2122t think that she was with us all day but I \u2013 I do remember running wild in the place. I do. And I\u2122m throwing things into windows and from windows down, and I\u2122m sure that happened while I was unsupervised. Do you remember if you were with other kids? R: Yeah, yes. War games, I guess you would call them. I: Don\u2122t you remember drawing, some inkling of memory, I think you once mentioned to me. I don\u2122t know, it doesn\u2122t come to me at this moment. The head of the children\u2122s school was in your transport from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz and hi s name I forgot but it will come to me in a minute. Very influential person, because he ke pt such a wonderful spirit among the children there and um\u2013 I think that when I mentione d it to you once, you did remember drawing. Do you remember any thoughts you had about these wagons with dead bodies, I mean, did you think it was interesting as a child, do you recall any thought you had then? I: My thoughts were that I didn\u2122t understand it, didn\u2122t understand what it was but I\u2013 R: I don\u2122t think that it made the emotional impact that it would to somebody a lot older. \u201aCause it was just something\u2013 we were learning new things and I think it was just another thing for us to learn. I: It was life, whatever it was, that is what happened to some people. Do you have any memory of wearing a star? I: I don\u2122t. R: I do. What do you recall about that? R: Hmm. Do you recall getting it, or do you just recall wearing it\u2013 11R: I just had it. I don\u2122t know where even. I don\u2122t know\u2013 where would that have been. Probably in Prague. R: In Prague, yeah, yeah. Very small, but it wa s there and \ufb01Juden.\ufb02 I remember people pointing to us because of it but uh\u2013 it\u2122s the first time I ever\u2013 I: Mentioning Prague, I just remembered something. And probably \u0152 maybe this didn\u2122t even happen \u0152 because Prague was never bombed was it ? I remember sirens, I remember sirens and I remember that we would go downstairs\u0160 must ha ve been Prague because where else would I have gone downstairs? Was this a large building that you lived in? Many apartments or do you know\u2013? R: Not terribly, I would say like six, seven stories. Right? I: Yeah, something like that. R: Going down\u2013 I: Yes, yes. And all the other people in the building went down too\u0160 there were other people there too. Yeah. Was there food dow n there or any provisions? R: Would this fit? Yeah, it could. I don\u2122t know off hand but it might. R: It is very vague\u0160 very misty. In your home, did you speak German? Do you remember? I: I think we spoke German. Because I seem to understand Yiddish after the war and I couldn\u2122t figure out how, so\u0160 it had to be. An early implant\u0160 I: An early implant from someplace. See, the grownups thought that I didn\u2122t understand what they were saying but I understood. R: Seemingly, we understood but I don\u2122t reme mber what language, but when anybody spoke, especially the Germans there, I knew exactly what they were saying. So that would have to be. But I am sure that since we grew up in Czechosl ovakia, that we must have learned that too\u0160 the first few years. I: But see\u2013 R: Or you don\u2122t think that we were out all that much? I: No, I don\u2122t think that we were out and I thi nk that you learned Czech after the war, because I have no recollection of Czech at all, German yes. R: I don\u2122t remember the language, I just remember understanding. 12Do you remember, do you have any memories of a ny of the S.S. guards or the soldiers? What they looked like or um\u2013 treatment of other people or of yourself? I: Well the first recollection that I have of the S.S. \u0152 I guess \u0152 or the soldiers or whatever, was when we took this very long walk in Theresienstadt to the train that was to take us to Auschwitz. R: There were dogs there\u2013 I: And they had dogs there. It was a long column of people who were marc hing, it was at night, there was snow on the ground and it was very, bitterly cold. And if people didn\u2122t walk quickly enough, they would shoot them. They would just shoot the people. There were shots that rang out and I just saw bodies kind of falling. I don\u2122t know \u0152 again \u0152 I don\u2122t think that I really understood that they were dead or that they weren\u2122t going to get up again and there were dogs and I remember that I was kind of tired and I didn\u2122t want to go on this trip\u0160 my mom\u2013 R: Our mother held us by our hands, pulling us, I: Pulling us\u2013 R: I remember that. You were being roused awake or\u2013 I: Well, it was at night\u2013 R: It was at night, but it started\u2013 at the evening, it was prob ably\u2013 it wasn\u2122t an arousal in the middle of the night, it was something that was ongoing in the evening\u2013 I: And it seemed like a very long walk, but that might have been that we were so little\u2013 Little legs\u0160 I: Little legs, it seems that the transport card, which was posted on the wall in Theresienstadt \u0152 and that is when you knew your time had come to go. We recovered these transport tickets and they are in a museum in Israel, in a kibbutz \u0152 Givat Chaim Yihud \u0152 they have a whole slew of things about Czech-all the Czech families that we re in Theresienstadt and that\u2122s in fact, where Rene and I found an affidavit that indicated that our mother had died in Auschwitz. R: And our names are there\u0160 I: Our names\u0160 R: With dates of birth are th ere, everything is there. I: And what transport numbers \u0152 the numbers that we had on the transport \u0152 to Theresienstadt and from Theresienstadt and to Auschwitz and the dates. R: December 15\u0160 I: December 15 to Auschwitz\u2013 R: To Auschwitz\u0160 1943. 13I: To Theresienstadt it was August. R: About a year-August\u0160 I: 1942. Or September 9, I am not sure, I always get confused. R: No it was August\u2013 I: Yeah, it was August. R: A little over a year\u2013 I: There was also another artist that was on that same transpor t \u0152 and he has drawn account after account of what happened that night \u0152 and you can see in his black and white drawings the pitch black of night and the entrance into Auschwitz \u0152 the spilling out of the prisoners from the cattle cars \u0152 and it\u2122s a very clear image of what they actually went through. Bernard\u2013 um\u2013 I forgot his name. This photograph of you two and your mother, where was this taken, do you remember? I: Theresienstadt R: Theresienstadt Was there\u2013do you remember why it was taken, did there just happen to be a photographer in Theresienstadt? They were doing these things\u2013 I: Doing these things and I think they sent it out to family members to say \u0152 \ufb01We\u2122re fine. Everything is great.\ufb02 Do you think that this was probably done early? Do you recall that it happened shortly after you arrived in the camp? R: I couldn\u2122t say. We were there over a year , empirically, knowing this now. I don\u2122t recall. I: It is hard to tell. R: But looking at us, I would say that we looked pretty good\u0160 so\u0160 I: So it might have been early. R: Early. Do you have any memory of the clothes that you were wearing? R: No, I remember what my mother was wearing \u0152 how it felt. 14I: But I remember\u2013 my hair. R: I remember your dress\u2013 that dress\u2013 colors. I: I remember that dress. R: Sort of reddish, purplish\u2013 I: Reddish, purplish right. Yeah. And I remember\u0160 R: \u0160and there was yellow lines, right?? I: Yes! Yes! So the squares are purplish? R: Yeah, basically a purplish background, they were like squares and also like yellow. I: See that. R: But obviously this is the first time ever that I am remembering this. I: But I remember that my mom always made me a thing on top of my head\u2013 R: Yeah the long\u0160 I: I had long hair and she always had\u2013 yeah right. What was your mother\u2122s name? R: Ita. And so you recall walking to the transport to Auschwitz, and the dogs and the guards shooting people who were straggling I guess. Or beating them, or yelling and the dogs barking. Yeah, they just had to get the trains loaded. I: It was horrible. R: Yeah, it was our first real display of real uh\u2013 force against the people \u0152 that I remember. I: It was horrible. And your mother was pulling you along? Had you by the hand. R: Yeah. She had two of us, she couldn\u2122t carry much of anything else right? 15I: But she also did, she still had some thing. A small parcel of some sort. What do you recall about the transport itself? I: That was horrible. R: That I remember. Uh\u2013 we were absolutely ja mmed into this car, I can smell the stench of what went on in there. Everything went on in th ere. And we were there for a very, very long time. People were trying to faint and fall down, but they almost couldn\u2122t because\u0160 I: It was so crowded, you couldn\u2122t turn around or anything. It seemed like an endless journey. Just an endless journey. You were all together in a car. I: Yeah, with lots and lots of other people. There was nothing to eat. I remember being very thirsty. I remember biting my hand. What did biting your hand do? I: I wanted to cry but I knew that\u0160 I didn\u2122t dare cry, I think R: That was really a strange environment, we really didn\u2122t know what was going on. This was so unnatural. I: I didn\u2122t understand what was happening. R: Heard the clickety click of the train rolling, just on and on and on. Do you remember anything about your mother on th is transport? Anything that she was doing or saying to you? R: She was up there\u0160 I was down. I: Yeah, she was standing. R: She was holding us close, that is all I remember. There wasn\u2122t any contact. I: I kind of remember hanging on to her legs. R: Yeah right. I: I remember that I wanted to sit down. I want ed to sit, but there was no space, you couldn\u2122t turn around. Do you remember other children on the transport? 16R: No. Did your mother have any food with her? Do you recall her passing any bread to you or potato or\u2013? I: I would think that she must have had something but I don\u2122t remember. So this journey took quite a while? Several days? I: At least a day, I would think. We arri ved December 18, so it took three days. R: I think that there were people who died on that ride. I: Oh, there were. R: Because, when they opened the doors, th ey were lying, there was no movement down. You remember that? R: Yeah. The stench was unbelievable. That I can smell every once in a while, actually. \ufb01Heraus\ufb02\u0160 it was German again and the dogs and \ufb01schnell,\ufb02 \ufb01macht schnell.\ufb02 And again your mother had you\u0160 you were thrown out of the train? I: And miraculously enough, we stayed with our mother. There was a whole Czech Lager, a special family Lager for the Czech families that everybody stayed together-men, women and children. It was a special\u0160 from Decembe r to March, we stayed together. So, other twins have recounted them yelling for twins, \ufb01Zwilling, Zwilling\ufb02 (ph 445). Do you recall that? I: We heard that also but it didn\u2122t mean a nything. Well\u0160 maybe it di d but I don\u2122t\u2013 because I remember that we went with our mother to th e hospital to be\u2013 whatever\u0160 to be checked out and the reason I remember this \u0152 I love to tell th is story \u0152 the reason I remember this is because he (Rene) was such a cry-baby when it came to doc tors. Now, I was scared that he was going to cry and that they were going to beat him up or hit him, because I was such a stoic. (Laughs) So somebody examined you two and your mother? I: I remember that she was with us, one time, sh e was there with us. But that might have been when they knew that we were twins. Did you two, did you know you were twins? It might sound like a silly question, but\u2013 I: I don\u2122t think so. 17R: No, no. It had no meaning. It took on meaning later, I think, when we were separated and I first got into the group of the male twins that I realized I was a twin. Even then, I wasn\u2122t sure that I knew that it was different than being just a normal kid. But what it really meant uh\u2013 So after it was \ufb01Haraus\ufb02 out of the cars , you were taken directly to this Lager? I: This barrack, yeah, this Lager where all the ot her Czech families were and my recollections of then are really\u0160 again, we were with our moth er, there was very little food\u0160 I remember we used to get a piece of dark, black bread and um\u2013some kind of slop to drink\u0160 I don\u2122t know, something that tasted awful and but I recall s eeing people beaten in that Lager, I don\u2122t know why. But\u2013 Were there just women and children in that Lager or did it seem like whole families were together? I: I think it seemed like whol e families were together. Bu t I am not\u2013 what do you recall? R: I don\u2122t have any recollection of any of this until we were separated and then I start to pick up memories. Because I was totally on my own the n, and then I really had to\u2013 it seems like we were really guarded. I just don\u2122t remember any of the outside things that happened. I: I remember, sometimes we had to stand outside in the mornings for something or other-when our mother was there-I don\u2122t know. Any other recollections of your day in this Lager? Do you think you were just in there the whole day or\u2013until these Appells came about? I: I have no\u2013 R: Not in that period. I start remembering after we were separated, I started to have day activities and then I start remembering our morning roll calls uh\u2013 I remember the bigger and older were taken off to work and uh\u2013 Where were you taken then? You were removed\u2013 I: At some point, I think it was in March of th at year or April or whatever, maybe in June\u2013 R: \u201a44 I: No, it was \u201a43 R: No, \u212244. We got there in\u2013 I: That\u2122s right, December \u212243, so sometime in \u2122 44, I recall one particular terrible day when I just recall that we were ripped away from our mo ther and I recall a loud scream and um\u2013 I knew something\u0160 something had happened. You know, so mething was happening that was terrible. 18Was it your scream that you heard or\u2013 I: I think it was my mother\u2122s. R: I think it was my mother\u2122s. I: She was trying to hold on to us and we were just grabbed\u2013 R: Pulled away from her\u0160 I: Pulled away from her and\u2013 This was within the Lager? I: Yeah, inside. And then the next thing I knew, I was in someplace different with just other women and girls and Rene wasn \u2122t there anymore and my mo m wasn\u2122t there anymore. How were you taken to this new place? Do you remember, were you walked, or did they put you in a truck or\u2013? I: I don\u2122t recall. What are your recollections about this? (To Rene) R: Same. The very same. And then I was just th ere in this new surrounding -it was very close to one of the ovens \u0152 the Crematoria \u0152 because I saw people walking in constantly\u0160 one way. And that is where I start remember ing how my days were \u0152 hunting through garbage for a potato and seeing these daily beatings in the roll call lines in the mornings. Also, ve ry vividly, I remember, prisoners \u0152 the Russian soldiers and the Polish soldiers \u0152 they were shot. They were lined up against the ditch and they were just shot. And the children \u0152 I was just six years old \u0152 we would look over the pit and see some of them still twitching and I remember pulling \u0152 not me, but some of the older boys \u0152 they pulled one fellow out who was obviously still alive but he did have a big swelling in his head \u0152 which had to be a bulle t most probably \u0152 and they took him into the barracks and put him on one of the bunks. I don\u2122t know what happened to him. But these things happened almost daily \u0152 the shootings. Somebody wa s always being shot. There I also remember the sirens \u0152 they were more frequent occurrences as the war grew \u0152 the sirens and the hum of the airplanes above and always an S.S. trooper standing in front of the barracks at the time, outside. I am just going to pause this for one second. *START OF SIDE TWO (2)-COUNTER 625 So Rene, you were taken from your mother and brought to Lager B-2B uh\u2013how were you initiated into the new Lager? What do you re member first about coming there? Did anybody show you the\u0160 19R: Yeah, there was concern by older people who were like me \u0152 they were twins, this I know now \u0152 and one of their big concerns was getting me a pair of shoes. You were barefoot at the time? R: I must have been, or maybe they didn\u2122t fit or something. I needed shoes, and somehow they managed through the black market to get me shoes for a loaf of bread. I even remember the color of the shoes \u0152 they were a yucky brown, you know \u0152 up to here. They covered the knee\u0160 no, not the knee, the ankle. And they were like, you know, a caramel color brown. But they were almost like brand new and so I felt like I was be ing taken care of, but it was a totally different existence. I was really\u2013 my eyes were opene d, I questioned like, \ufb01What\u2122s going on?\ufb02 \ufb01Who is the master of this?\ufb02 I remember asking, \ufb01Who is in charge here?\ufb02 You know like who can I ask? Who can I talk to? And in the background, all the mornings, the co ld, the hunt for potatoes in the garbage and the endless lines of people walking to this\u2013and\u2013 Did you go around with other twins or the other people in the\u2013 the other children looking for scraps? R: I always remember being al one. Totally alone. I know they were there but the hunt was always alone. Do you remember a time that you were especial ly successful in finding something to eat? A substantial piece of br ead, a whole potato? Yeah, these moments happened, but I had to go inside and have it cut up so that I could warm it on the stove inside. You warmed the potato? R: Yeah, there were moments. They were wonderful moments when you found something that you could really eat but nothing really substantial like finding a box or anything like that. Maybe a big potato that wasn\u2122t totally rotten\u0160 that was a find. You mentioned that you were questioning ma ny things. Did you\u2013 what did people tell you or\u2013 what did you ask about this procession going into the gas chambers? R: I never asked that, that was just something that was happening. But I asked, \ufb01Who is the master of\u2013 who is the master of the world?\ufb02 I think I asked. I was told \ufb01Hitler\ufb02 Okay. I was satisfied. That was an answer. The prisoners answered you that. R: Yeah. And part of, I guess, daily activity \u0152 I have to retell \u0152 is the sleeping thing at night. On these bunk beds and ____(??ph 55) and so close to the wood, smelling it and also getting pushed and many times, just being able to squeeze in someplace, to have a space. But alone. 20Did you always sleep in the same approximate spot? R: I was just asking myself the same ques tion. I don\u2122t remember. I don\u2122t recall. Do you remember anything about that in your\u2013? I: Well, you know, my memories are a little different than Rene\u2122s. But we did have bunk beds as well, and there was this long oven down the center, and I think we were somewhat assigned to beds, but I am not sure that everybody always went to these same beds. I particularly remember one night, having to get up and having to go to the bathroom\u0160 well, not that they had bathrooms but\u2013 outside in the back, and then coming back and getting totally confused as to what side of the barrack my bed was on. And I really got into a state of panic, but I knew I had to get into a bed, and I kept going over\u0160 you know, I would go over and ask somebody if I could just come in next to them, and I remember being pushed away and them saying, \ufb01This is not your bed.\ufb02 And the more his happened, you know I just was panicking, and so I remember climbing over the oven and saying well maybe\u2013 I was so conf used. And finally somebody had pity on me and let me come in with them. Was anybody taking\u2013did anybody \ufb01adopt\ufb02 you? I: No. There was just no kind of organization of any sort. It seemed to me that most of the girls were older. I didn\u2122t really see too many\u0160 certain ly not younger than me\u0160 I don\u2122t recall. And no one seemed to be in charge and I\u2013 I remember particularly being extremely, extremely lonely. It was like the worst thing. There was no one. And I remember that we would receive bread and some soup, and I tried to save my piece of bread, I figured that if I held on to it longer that I would have it for the whole day. But then somebody always stole it from me at night. Now, I don\u2122t know if it was somebody else or it was the rats who ate it, but I never had it in the morning. And um\u2013did I learn? No, I did this every night. I remember that there were two girls that were with me and they had little pouches, and they used to hide their bread in the little pouches. It was a separate pouch? I: Yeah, a little thing\u2013 I\u2013 and I would say, oh I wish I had one of those\u0160 but I didn\u2122t. Um\u2013 I vividly also remember going to the hospital. And being sick. And I remember standing\u0160 that\u2122s when I remember standing for roll call\u0160 that wa s in Auschwitz in the morning\u0160 almost every morning. Once you were in that Lager\u2013 I: Yes, definitely. And I rememb er it distinctly because I always tried to hide behind somebody big so that I wouldn\u2122t be seen, so that I wouldn\u2122t be chosen for anything. I didn\u2122t question \u0152 I hardly spoke to anyone \u0152 but I was beginning to comprehend from what I was hearing that terrible things were going on\u0160 that whatever was happening was terrible. Although to me at this time\u0160 this was life and I didn\u2122t remember anythi ng else. I didn\u2122t think this was wrong, right or otherwise. I just knew that if I wasn\u2122t spotted, I wouldn\u2122t maybe get chosen for something and um\u2013I remembered that I could \u0152 from out of th e door of the barrack \u0152 I could, at some point\u2013 I remembered that I had a brother, and I remembered that he was to the right\u0160 this way. And if I 21looked out this way, then his barrack was there. And I remember th is on a night in particular when there was some kind of explosion and ther e was a big fire and I was terrified that his barrack was the one that was on fire. Um\u2013 I reme mber often seeing people run into the fence and uh\u2013get electrocuted. And I remember on one particular occasion\u0160 and there were dead bodies on the ground, I remember one time trying to hide among these dead bodies. I don\u2122t exactly know why\u0160 I don\u2122t know what it was I was scared of, I think I just wanted to disappear and thought that maybe this was a good, convenient way to do it. These were bodies outside the barrack, stacked up or\u2013? I: Yeah, just\u2013right. And I thought that this way, I could hide somehow and it would all be over. I don\u2122t really know what went th rough my mind. It wa s a child\u2122s idea \u0152 you know \u0152 be still like everybody else and no one will notice me. What about the other children in that particular Lager? I: There were some older children but I again\u0160 it seemed like they hung around with each other. So now, later on, I know that they were other twin girls, so I guess that they hung around with each other. I didn\u2122t have my twin\u0160 because he wa s\u2013 we were not of the same sex so it was a little harder. But throughout all the time in the hospital and through experiments and through horrible times, I always felt that Rene was alive and I said that I have to stay alive to take care of him. This was like my mission in life and I ve ry clearly remember um m\u2013 standing on line \u0152 it was always cold, of course \u0152 and we were going into the showers, standing naked and again. I bring up the locket \u0152 for a long time, I was miracul ously able to hang on, hide the fact that I had this locket, and always put it b ack on after I came out of the showers. I also remember that somehow I knew already that not everybody came out of the showers, so every time we were lined up like this, I remember that fear, li ke oh my God, is this the last time? After the shower you would be lined up? I: No\u0160 before. Before. What happened when you got sick? I: I was in the hospital. Did you get yourself to the hospital or\u2013 I: I think somebody else must have. Periodically, I was taken to the hospital because I had certain medical procedures I guess, done to me\u0160 like\u0160 again\u0160 I don\u2122t remember exactly why, or what for, or the very detailed specifics. But I can remember that, at one poi nt, I had blood taken out from my neck. You know\u2013 I don\u2122t\u2013 but it is vi vid because it was extremely painful. And another time, I was strapped to a table of some sort, and there was a doctor \u0152 he was in white and he had a scalpel. Well, I didn\u2122t know it was a sc alpel then. I realize it now that it was\u2013 and um\u2013 he cut me. And I remember also being x-raye d. I remember a lot of x-rays, kind of stuff and of course being measured and stuff like th at. But I also remember \u0152 and I don\u2122t know what this has to do with anything \u0152 but wires. Wi res attached to me and um\u2013 something with 22electric\u2013 I don\u2122t know. And, I remember, um\u2013 reme mber seeing in one room\u0160 in some room, I don\u2122t know\u2013 there were eyes. Don\u2122t ask me\u0160 Like eyes? Just independent eyes? I: I don\u2122t know. But I also rememb er getting injections that made me very sick because then I found myself in kind of a hospital bed or some thing and um\u2013 I remember throwing up a lot and having diarrhea, and I was extremely sick. I reme mber though that there was some nurse there who kind of looked after me, and I think there wa s one point when they were cleaning out the hospital. I don\u2122t know\u0160 again, now, they were probably just going to kill everybody, I am not sure, but there\u2013it was a very hurried kind of thing. There was a big commotion and this person grabbed me and just stuck me under her skirt and it was all dark and she just said be quiet. You know\u0160 she didn\u2122t have to tell me twice and um\u2013I think she saved me, I think she saved me from something\u2013 I don\u2122t know. When the doctor cut you, do you remember anything about it? I: I just remember I must have fainted or\u2013 I don\u2122t remember anything else after that except waking up in a lot of pain. And during any of those examinations, you were never with Rene? I: No. The only time I remember being with him is when we went with our mom that time. I don\u2122t ever remember being there again with Rene . \u201aCause I never saw you again after that. At least I don\u2122t remember seeing you. R: I was there a couple of times, but nothing like \u2013 at least I don\u2122t recall\u0160 the only thing I recall is being measured, the touch of the very cold instruments and the word \ufb01Runken\ufb02 \u0152 that\u2122s x-ray, I think, in German. I remember that. So there wa s a lot of that going on but that\u2122s about all. What were the measurements? R: Around the head, body, head, everything. Because they were sort of trying to\u2013 they were putting you in between something, to see how, I gu ess how big\u0160 it wasn\u2122t like they were taking a tape measure, they put you ag ainst something cold, steel\u0160 I: There was steel, it was very cold. R: Very cold. Who was the person doing the procedure? Um, did they talk to you or ask you anything? I: Um, I just remember being terrified, and I knew that I had to just not cry and just do everything that I was told. No matter what. When you were\u2013 How was it that you knew you were taken to be examined? Did, one morning, somebody\u0160 soldier come in and take you, or di d you know that on a particular day you would go? R: I was walked over by one of the older boys. I am sure that I was the youngest kid there. I was walked over by one of the older boys and that was it. 23Do you have a recollection of the \ufb01twins\u2122 father?\ufb02 The gentleman Zvi Spegel (ph 202)? R: He could have been the one. I know of him on ly in\u2013 1985, I learned of him. I met [him] in Israel, Zvi Spegel. Did he remember you? R: No. I think his mind was sort of on the blink at that point. But ther e was somebody else in 1985 who remembered me, which was very heartwarming. I: And he was part of Zvi Spegel\u2122s group. R: And he was part of that group so obviously I was there. Some of the other male twins have described se eing each other\u2013 seeing the Soviet prisoners in the next half of the barracks. Do you recall any older men there? R: Yeah. The only\u2013 the Soviet\u2013 the soldiers, I remember they were periodically shot, they were the ones that were always taken and disposed of\u2013 the partisans (ph 214)? I: Do you remember Adolph (ph 215)? R: No. But the only one I would remember is th at young kid\u0160 that one other one that I met in Israel. I: Peter Grainfield? R: Yeah. Peter. Very vaguely. I met this man in Israel and he was the only one that would have been my size. I: He was about a year younger. R: And that was extremely young. Because I don\u2122t think the older boys would\u0160 even socially they wouldn\u2122t associate with us. Because I think that the next up was at least three or four years older and at that point, that is a big difference so\u0160 we were alone, except that I was told that I played with him. And I kept looking at him and uh\u2013 I sort of \u2013 it stirred some memories, but nothing specific. Nothing specific really. What I was going to say\u2013 You were asking about who did some of the experimentati on \u0152 the Museum at Auschwitz now has the documents, which we got copies of, of our names \u0152 both our names a nd numbers \u0152 matching and all that. Irene has a document where there is a signature of blood testing and Mengele\u2122s signature on the bottom of it-so he could have been one of the gentlemen who participated in this-pretty sure. They took blood from you as well? R: I don\u2122t recall them taking blood from me, no. But you recall the x-ray procedures? R: I recall the x-rays and measuring, that I remember. The other things\u2013 Did these x-ray procedures take a long time? 24Time didn\u2122t have much meaning to me. It just happened. You both had numbers? Y ou were both tattooed? R: Yes. What do you recall about receiving those numbers ? Was that when you first entered Auschwitz or when you were transferred to the separate Lagers? I: Since our numbers are so different, I would imagine that it must have been when we were separated because we had totally different numbers. R: Yeah, my number, I remember it being put on , it hurt. There was an awful stench all around me, it was muddy and it was like a n eedle pricking me, but in terms of time, when they put it, I can\u2122t put it anywhere. You said it was muddy. It was done outside? R: It was muddy when I walked up to\u2013 yeah, it was done outside. Whoever it was, they were sitting at a desk with a cover over it but I stepped into it like from outside. And um\u2013 I\u2122ll show you my number, I have a very cl ear number. It reads this way: 169061. And that\u2122s confirmed by some of the records. But when I first saw that nu mber with my name next to it \u0152 also, only in the last few years \u0152 that really gave me the chil ls again, confirming dreams, memories of long, long ago. Which still affect you, I guess. I\u2122m sure they do. Did anyone tell you that you had to be account able for this number in some way? R: You know, after the war, which is really\u0160 for children, I think, the hardest part\u0160 this is like another Holocaust starting or use\u2013 That\u2122s how I look at it. I took an awful lot of beatings because of this number because that identified me as a Jew, in Czechoslovakia, after the war, when everything was supposedly very nice and good. There was no relief for children who\u2013 seven years old, all alone. I mean parents can ap preciate this sort of thing. When you become a parent you will understand. Irene, do you have recollections of receiving a number? I: I drew a blank on that. I do remember just va guely, a needle jabbing my arm but I didn\u2122t make anything of it. I just saw that everyone had one of those\u0160 I wanted one also. I wanted to be like everyone else. You described an explosion you heard. Do you recall this explosion\u0160 fire coming out? R: No. But my feelings about Irene being alive, the way that she felt, I felt that too. And I do remember seeing her once, through the wires, an d I knew it was her\u2013 it had to be. Some time had elapsed since we were separated, uh\u2013 I think it was toward the end, but I knew that she was alive because of that\u0160 I just knew that she was alive. That just confirmed the whole thing for me\u0160 that she never died in my thinking\u0160 she wa s always alive in my consciousness until we met in the States many years later. What are your next me mories about Auschwitz? 25R: Well, just prior to liberation, there was this incident of us being taken and almost done away with by another officer other than Mengele and uh\u2013 very clearly do I remember this incident. Another doctor? R: I don\u2122t know if it was a doctor, an officer. And I remember Mengele coming in just in the nick of time in his green convertible and stopping this whole procession, and I also remember \u0152 and Irene I guess had that feeling many times \u0152 I knew that this was going to be deadly. I mean this fear instinct I guess \u0152 I had a feeling that this could be the end for me \u0152 and the horrible feeling. So Mengele stopped this. And also, towards the end of\u2013 there was this march that we all went on, that they marched us out of\u2013 I mean, the last week or so\u0160 weeks\u2013 again, time is meaningless\u0160 but I do remember a lot of excite ment among the German soldiers and distant artillery fire getting louder and louder and them taking us on to this march\u0160 that was a pretty gruesome type affair because they \u0152 again \u0152 shot anybody or just\u2013 anybody who wouldn\u2122t/couldn\u2122t continue they just\u2013 This was January, 1945? R: This was January. Right. And that was a long, long haul if I remember. I can\u2122t put it in terms of hours, but then all of a sudden the German sold iers were gone and the Russian soldiers were around us \u0152 in white uniforms. I remember one o fficer being on a horse \u0152 I think it was a pink horse (laughs). A very big\u0160 huge animal. But they were all dressed in white and that was the liberation. So you were en route on the march? You hadn\u2122t reached anywhere in particular? R: No, no. And you realized that people were being shot if they were straggling behind? R: Yes. Do you remember making a conscious effort to\u0160 R: Yes. I had to keep going, and she was my stre ngth, and I knew I had to make it for her, as was the case for many of my ot her hardships that came about later. She gave me the strength to keep going. Did you have a blanket with you or anything? R: Don\u2122t recall. Do you recall getting any bread rations before the march? R: Nothing. I do remember the Russians marched us into a warehouse of some kind after this happened and there was a tremendous scramble for food. I wanted to get in on this. I do remember getting a can of some kind and rollin g it and then I finally got somebody to open it\u0160 it was sauerkraut. That is my memory of this th ing \u0152 big yellow, yellow, golden kind of a can \u0152 it was huge to me then. I don\u2122t know how big it really was, but I had to roll it, I couldn\u2122t lift it. Surely, you ate it? 26R: I had something of it. A lot of people didn\u2122t do so well because they overate, I understand. That was liberation from Auschwitz. And for you Irene? I: I went\u2013I must have been at a different camp (laughs). Ki nd of towards the end, before liberation as I know it now, I sensed someth ing had changed. Uh\u2013 there wasn\u2122t\u0160 suddenly there wasn\u2122t this order in the day anymore. We weren\u2122t being put outside, we weren\u2122t standing\u2013 somehow there was no order anymore and I \u0152 at that point \u0152 was, I must have been quite sick because I remember just that I was on the ground. I couldn\u2122t get up. And there were other people also lying on the ground \u0152 I don\u2122t know if it was because they were hungry or sick or what. I do remember something had changed\u0160 I wasn\u2122t qu ite aware of what\u0160 but there seemed to be people who were kind of a little bit\u2013 saying that we\u2122re saved \u0152 I didn\u2122t know what that meant \u0152 and the next thing I knew was that I was picked up by some Polish lady and she took me. Within the camp? You were still within the camp? I: In the camp, but she took me out of the camp. So I was not part of this march \u0152 you know, that was not me \u0152 I was already gone. A nd um\u2013I was with her a while. Where did she take you? I: It seemed she lived in Auschwitz, in th e town proper, and she took me to her house. For how long did you stay with her? I: I was there until Rescue Children extricated me. It must have been\u2013 This is an organization? I: Yes, an organization to get back Jewish children. But um\u2013 I remember Christmas very vividly, so I was there at least a year. I remember her telling me that Santa Claus is going to come out of the moon\u0160 she says to me\u0160 I believed her. Yeah, right! Did she have other children? I: No. It was just her? Was she married? I: Um\u2013I think she was married, but I was an only child. I guess, I suppose you learned Polish? I learned Polish. And when did this relief organization find you and take you? I guess about a year later and um\u2013 I first went to Prague to an orphanage and then I went to France to an orphanage and then a different orphanage blah, blah, blah\u2013 a lot of orphanages. I got shuttled around a bit. 27And Rene, after liberation and the warehouse, what was your\u2013 R: The next recollection I have, I understand that I was in a hospital in Bratislava \u0152 so I am told \u0152 and I had some TB \u0152 tuberculosis \u0152 a touch of it. And the next\u2013 the memories for me, really begin in Czechoslovakia in a town called Ko\u0131ice (Kaschau) (ph 390), in an orphanage. A big orphanage in a hospital complex. Was this specifically a Jewish orphanage? No. There were nuns, Mothers, around taking care. And uh\u2013 there was an administrator there \u0152 a doctor Kelina (ph 395) who, after some time, took me out and uh\u2013 with his wife\u0160 they had no children, and I lived with them. Subsequently, they had a child\u0160 Did they have a child? Or am I mixing it up with the other one? I: They didn\u2122t have any children. R: No, they did not. I am mixing him up with his brother. I lived with him for a while and they had to flee because somehow the Communists\u2013 so mebody made some statements regarding this man and he just got wind of it and he had to flee . So he left me with hi s sister and that\u2122s the family \u0152 the Mann family \u0152 and lived with them for a good number of years. They were the ones that had the other children, Bebe and Otto (ph 410) and they treated me very well. There I went to school \u0152 in Czechoslovakia \u0152 but there again, I was the only visible Jew and they were waiting for me everyday after school with stones. So the other Czech children\u2013 R: There was one other Jew, I remember, but we both had to run for our young lives at the time. And it was a good thing that we were still young and so the people that were waiting for us couldn\u2122t do all that much harm. They were still youngsters also, but they were serious and they were mean\u0160 so we had to run. I mean that after we were let out, we had to\u2013 Sprint home? R: Sprint home, very fast, sprint a long way too, because I lived very close to the school, they knew \u0152 they blocked my way \u0152 so I had to go somewhere else. It was always a big circle\u0160 sometimes it led into the fields. What was the name again? R: Kojista (ph 429). And the family\u2122s name? R: Mann. M-A-N-N? R: Yes, M-A-N-N, Joseph Mann and\u2013 I: Edith. 28R: Edith, yes. This was the sister\u2013 R: The sister yes, of Doctor Kalina. Unknown Woman: Just as an inte resting point, later on we found out from people in New York City here, that the search for the Jewish childre n that had been taken for a million reasons into Polish homes \u0152 Christian homes \u0152 the way that they discovered who was a Jew in these homes was that the rescuers would go to the town Bishop, or whoever was the religious cleric in the town, and they would ask for all the baptismal certificates of the children. And if there were four children in one home and three baptismal certific ates, the fourth one was the Jew. And they would exchange monies, or whatever the town ne eded \u0152 the Bishop I am sure was paid also \u0152 and then the children were rescued. So, because of that, the American Jewish Organizations were trying to raise funds to have monies to pa y for these children and through one of these organizations called Rescue Child, they were having dinner after dinner, I: It was called Rescue Children. Unknown Woman:\u2013Rescue Children, Inc., one of them \u0152 the prime mover of this \u0152 was a gentleman from Long Island and he, he went into Eu rope to one of his orphanages that had been set up for all these rescued orphans and he found Irene in one of them. And he said, \ufb01Oh, you\u2122d be perfect to come back to Ameri ca and just help us raise funds.\ufb02 This was just, like, your picture perfect orphan\u0160 with beautiful, full banana curls and a sweet face. And somehow he convinced her that she should come to America with him. and subsequently, she was made part of this Life Magazine article \u0152 Nov. 17, 1948\u2013 all about\u2013 1947\u2013 right, that\u2122s how Irene was taken out of the Polish home, by the way. One of these emissari es of Rescue Child\u2013 Rescue Children Inc\u2013 I: Well I\u2122m not sure, there were other organizations that worked in Poland. I think that Rescue Children came into the forefront later on when ma ny of these children were in France and they were trying to find their parents here in America\u0160 find relatives for them or else ship them to Israel or whatever. But when I was in Poland, you know Rene was talking about school \u0152 I was in \u0152 she was obviously a Catholic lady\u0160 I was in all Catholic school and I went to church\u2013 R: So did I. I went to church. Did you know that you were Jewish? R: Yes. I went to the end of the line. Many times I snuck away when they went to church, but many times I did go and went through the whole\u2013 whatever I went through. I: I went to Church. I knew I was Jewish because I had this number on my arm. I also was\u0160 as Rene said, I also was\u0160 getting very sick. Because I lay in bed, and I remember doctors coming and flitting in and out of fever, or whatever. And um\u2013 she was a very strict lady. I had to feed her bunny rabbits\u0160 she had rabbits. Which she would then cook. I couldn\u2122t eat them because I was taking care of them. And, in the summer, sh e had family that lived out on a farm, and I remember that it was a very long walk\u0160 it took al most half a day to get there. And there were other children there and I hated going there becau se they made fun of me because I had this number. And nobody defended me a nd I cried. I cried a lot. 29What would they say to you? I: They made fun of me because I had this number\u0160 that I\u2122m a prisoner of some sort, they kept saying. I cried a lot. But, with everything, when the Jewish organization \u0152 which might have been the Joint Distribution\u2013 uh I don\u2122t know\u2013Distribution Co., came to pull me out of that home, I had really come to like being Catho lic. I thought it was like\u2013 nifty. You know, Church, the whole bit, rosary beads. And I didn\u2122t want to leave \u0152 you know I really did not \u0152 I was very upset. I remember the first orphanage where I came to, I met somebody who I am still friends with to this day \u0152 her name is Miriam, she lives in Israel. And she was about seven years older than me, and she kind of became my mother fi gure\u0160 but she had also had\u2013 was from Poland and we were both sitting there with the Rosary beads plotting our escape from this orphanage because we wanted to go back, you know. Back to Poland? I: Right. This was when you were in Prague? I: Yes. So they removed you to Prague and fr om Prague you were taken to Paris. I: Yeah, I was outside of Paris in 525, and th at\u2122s where I was selected actually by Herbert Tenszer \u0152 he used to be a Congressman from here \u0152 and he chose me to come. And he promised me that he would send me back\u0160 promised. He didn\u2122t keep his promise. So you came to New York at that time? I: Yeah. And Rene, you had an exodus out of Europe also? R: Well, my exodus really tied t o\u2013related to her being taken in by somebody who lived out here on Long Island. A friend of Herbert Tenzer \u0152 was widely active in the organization \u0152 Mayer and Dina Slotkin \u0152 which is my name now \u0152 Rene Slotkin. And they took Irene in and that had to be maybe like \u212248. I: Yeah, it was at one point before I came to th em, I was with the Novicks, and they dragged out of me that I had a brother. Because I had never spoken about it and\u2013 R:So they took Irene into their home, right here in the Five Towns, and then they started to search for missing Rene. And it is a long and fascinating story but uh\u2013 Life Magazine was somehow instrumental in locating me because th is Dr. Kalina that I mentioned, had escaped. He had gone to Israel and somehow\u2013 Was he Jewish? R: Yes. And he had gotten hold of this Life Magazine, and in it, he saw Irene as Irene Guttman. The names clicked and he put it together \u0152 so he got in touch somehow with somebody here in New York and told them that I was living in Czechoslovakia with his sister. And they \u0152 the 30Slotkins \u0152 sent somebody over into Europe to get me out. And ther e was a lot of red tape, I had to go through Germany and documentation and Swit zerland for a while\u0160 not a direct route, and uh\u2013 I finally ended up\u2013 I: 1950\u0160 R: 1950, March 29, in Idlewild Airport, rainy night\u0160 I\u2122ll never forget that and we were reunited on that evening. So you remembered your last name. There was no reason why you should remember that your last name was Guttman, but I suppose you did. R: Well, why? That was my name, all the wa y through until\u2013 that was always my name\u0160 I knew my name. I: The Polish lady changed my name from Renatta to Ivenka (ph 588). So that\u2122s how Irene came. Unknown Woman: Zvi Spegel also reinforced everybody\u2122s identity in the camp\u0160 for the boys. He would have the boys\u2013 a newcomer come in right away, and they were greeted in like a circle and everybody would introduce themselves so their names were constantly being reinforced and who they were. End of Tape 1 counter number 598 Tape 2 I: It is only in retrospect now that June is talking about it a little that I do remember when I was in Poland, that every once in a while we would take this long walk \u0152 it seemed like a long walk to me \u0152 and we would shift through this mountain of ashes \u0152 looking \u0152 she told me I should be looking for gold. And it was just\u2013 I couldn\u2122t stand doing it\u2013 it was just\u2013 So these were crematory ashes then? I: It was just the worst. The worst. It was horri ble. And in the town where she lived \u0152 right across \u0152 her apartment kind of faced this village square \u0152 but to the right, down the road, was where the Russian soldiers were housed and I recall that she would sometimes send me there with things to\u2013 To trade or what? I: I don\u2122t know what, it was always wrapped up. So she would ma ke me go there, and I hated going there because I was afraid of these Russian soldiers-although they were very nice \u0152 I was scared of soldiers \u0152 it was a soldier and my recollection of soldiers was not somebody that I wanted to deal with \u0152 not after Auschwitz, so it was very scary for me \u0152 but she would make me go. I have no idea what transpired. R: I do want to say one thing about the Slotkin family. That it is amazing to me now that I am a parent and have children, that they had the willingness and uh\u2013the charity to extend themselves to a war orphan like Irene and then not knowing at all what I would be like, certainly a questionable background. And to spend these huge amounts of funds to send somebody to 31Europe to get me, to bring me over here and to adopt me at the age of 12\u2013 I am not sure that I could do it, knowing where I came from. I just don\u2122 t know\u0160 I really have to say that these were the most marvelous people to be able to do su ch a thing. And uh\u2013I think that there are other stories like that too. The Jewish community really went out at that time, once they knew what was going on really and in the open and things like this and I think that this should be known. I think the atrocities of what happened should be known, but I think that some of the good things that came about should also be publicized. When did you learn what became of your mother? Or did you seek out the information, did you ever confirm what happened to her? R: It was confirmed in \u212285, when we went to th is museum in (ph 034), Is rael. But I think I knew, right then and there when it happened. What about your father? Did you ever find out when and where he was sent? Was that ever obtainable? R: It was found out. June: Sometime in December 1941, he was taken to Auschwitz, because the records came back\u0160 one record that we have of his demise says December 1941. And he might have been one of the earliest prisoners that actually helped at Birkenau. That was when it was being built. They sent it political prisoners at that time and he fit that bill. Because of his import/export background? R: Therefore accusations of spy activity. Unknown Woman: It seems that he was th e first sent to the Petschek (Petschk v) (ph042) prison \u0152 which was actually the Petschek Palace and th e Nazis turned it into an interrogation prison from where no one ever returned. We learned\u2013 got this from other people who lived in Czechoslovakia at the time and we met them in 1985. R: I do remember going with our mo ther to a place with packages. Unknown Woman: Maybe you went to visit. R: Maybe. I don\u2122t remember visiting or seeing, but I do remember going to this very sound, fortress-like structure and bringing packages. Unknown Woman: There\u2122s a marker outside the Petschek now with the names of all the people who went through there\u0160 so it\u2122s possible that their dad\u2122s name is on it. What was his name? R: Herbert. Herbert Guttman. There are some documented stories from some of the other twins, at least for the boys, about playing\u0160 being taken to a field to play soccer. Do you have any recollections about anything like that? 32R: Obviously I wasn\u2122t big enough to be picked for the team. No, I don\u2122t remember. I played soccer after the war in Czechoslovakia, a little bit like a national pastime, like baseball is here. Unknown Woman: One of the older twins who talked to us in 1985 \u0152 and he just mentioned \u0152 that Rene was shepherded by this communist. Zv i Spegel set each person in kind of a pecking order. This twin had to take care of that twin, or this person had to take care of that twin and since Rene and Pepe \u0152 Peter Grainfield \u0152 were the youngest, they were given an adult male, and this fellow was named Otto, and he was the one who kind of kept Rene away from the wires.
