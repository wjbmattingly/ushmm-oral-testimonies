            "answer": "Well, I would say both. At first we, of course, were very dependent on our parents. But when our father was arrested in 1943, we realized \u2014 and I say we, my brother and I \u2014 realized what was happening. Well, we already realized what was happening back in 19 \u2014 November 9, 1938, Kristallnacht. Of course, I was not quite six years old. I was born in \u201933, January. And then I realized what was happening. And of course the Germans took my father\u2019s store away. They destroyed his inventory. They destroyed his sewing machines. Excuse me. [coughs] They destroyed everything and then forced us to live, again, in a apartment unit there. There were \u2014 I don\u2019t know how many different levels in that building there was, but we had one room below the kitchen. And that\u2019s what we had and that\u2019s what every other Jewish family had that had two kids. 6*0143 6 They each h-had one room with a kitchen, a small kitchen.

            "answer": "No, no, I do have memory of that. Si -- again, since we lived in the Jewish area, the Hitler youth already, kids 10 years old, there were many a times when we \u2014 the kids spit \u2014 spit at us. We could not defend ou-ourselves, even if we were at such an age where we could have \u2014 maybe we\u2019re stronger than those kids that spit at us or kicked us and so forth, but we were not permitted to hit anybody that had a Hitler youth uniform."

            "answer": "Okay, yes we did. Nowadays, even though my brother is a year older, he hardly remembers what transpired. He just wiped this whole thing out of his memory. If I can say here, last week, of course, was Holocaust Remembrance week. I was asked by the you \u2014 army in Fort Lewis, Washington, to talk about the Holocaust. The army there specifically asked Holocaust survivors, preferably concentration camp ho \u2014 su-survivors that have also been in the U.S. military, preferably in military service. I spent time in the U.S. Army, received a warrant officer commission during my service in Korea and I t-talked about the Holocaust. I did want my brother to talk about the Holocaust, but \u2014 and the reason I wanted him to talk, he spent time in Vietnam, he spent 22 years in the arm \u2014 U.S. Army, retired a major, a much higher ranking officer than me. But he says he just can\u2019t talk about it, he doesn\u2019t remember it and does not want to talk about it. And he\u2019s [indecipherable] he can\u2019t remember what has happened, yet he\u2019s a year older. He cannot speak German any more. While he was in the military he was stationed in Germany, in Heidelberg for three years, but never had anything to do with the Germans."

Don\u2019t get involved, don\u2019t get into arguments. And of course, in 1941, I think 1t was, when we had to wear the Jewish 6*0143 8 Star of David. And there were \u2014 it\u2019s not just wearing the star, there were limitations made, what \u2014 we couldn\u2019t go to a store except between five and six o\u2019clock in the afternoon.

And again, we were unique inasmuch our father was an American citizen. And our father never thought that he would be arrested and sent to a concentration camp.

And again, that was another reason that he f-felt, like many Jews that was in the German army during World War \u2014 World War I, figured that they would not ever be arrested. And even when my father lost his business, his tailor shop and was moved \u2014 a-and we had to go and live in this apartment, he had to go into slave labor, but he figured that\u2019s the worst that the Germans will do to him, they forced him into forced labor.

It was probably two or three days prior to Kristallnacht. The shop windows were just painted with pic \u2014 Jude, which means Jew, in front.

And it so happened this woman had children, two boys, almost our age and they wi \u2014 they looked a li \u2014 somewhat like us. So we actually took their I.D., pictures of them, and we moved to a reso-sort area in Binz auf Rugen. It\u2019s a eastern part of Germany and my mother had a job there as a \u2014 as a maid at one of the \u2014 at a big hotel again, where soldiers took their own rest and recuperation. And she was \u2014 my mother became a maid over there, and had an income. But again, after about four months we had to move, because again, school. We didn't dare go to school. In fact there was a time where all the German kids had to work out on a farm and pick vegetables and things, so there was no school. And so my brother and I were out there with the other German kids, boys and girls, pulling vegetables and things like that. But then it got \u2014 school started and we had to move because we didn\u2019t dare go to school again. And so we went back to Berlin, again this midwife, she mailed \u2014 via mail she sent us the proper documents that we needed in case there\u2019s an I.D. check. But at that time we almost has the proper I.D. for Hitler youth. But we were lucky that there was no I.D. check on our way to Berlin, back from Binz auf Raden(ph) on the train, because we would have been caught of the \u2014 it was very, very, very scary when we went in public transportation. But we ended up back in Berlin. I think we kept that identification until the end of the war, the \u2014 by the name of Schmitz.

And there were times my brother and I were going to drink it, and we kind of kept each other from drinking it. We knew that that is dirty, we\u2019re not going to 6*0143 37 drink it. And we, with quite a few other Germans, moved to the next station, which was not flooded then. And we probably spent \u2014 and my \u2014 our mother was still alive then, and \u2014 who kind of kept us, too, from drinking it. And we got to the other station that was not flooded, and \u2014 but we needed water, and so my mother went outside the station upstairs to a fire hydrant to get water. And she didn't come back down. And I went up and I do remember seeing her lying at the fire hydrant. And actually she was killed, I don\u2019t know if it was German or Russians, but the crossfire between the Russians and the Germans. And so \u2014 and I never could get the water, I was forced to go back down into the subway station by German soldiers. I was a kid, and he forced me to go back down. And I would say that same day, all of a sudden two Russian soldiers came into that subway station with Tommy guns \u2014 machine guns in each hand and everyone \u2014 everyone down in that subway tunnel started clapping. There were a few German soldiers there, they threw down their weapons and surrendered to those two Russian soldiers. And again, this was at Anhalter Bahnhof, which is no longer a subway station, but the station is still there as a \u2014 a memorial, so to speak. And that was the end of the war for us.

And we, for awhile were guides to some of the Russian officers going from point A to point B."

            "question": "Previous to you losing your mother, were di \u2014 di \u2014 wasn\u2019t there a situation where you were taken away?",
            "answer": "Yes. We didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t cover that. Yes, again, like I said, we moved around freely under false I.D., and again in a streetcar, and I was there by myself. I think I may have been on my way to this midwife, Noelting, because she had some groceries for us. And we\u2019d do that, sometimes my brother went to see her. And this was on April 15\", 1945. I was caught in a streetcar. And the reason is they had what I always feared, we all of us feared, an I.D. check. And they had an I.D. check and I had the I.D., I was \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the first name, the last name was Schmitz. But I didn't have my Hitler youth card with me. So again, they make you drop the pants and they knew pretty much if you didn\u2019t have the Hitler youth I.D. you were Jewish. And of course, to a 12 year old having to drop their pants in front of everybody was a humiliation to begin with. And of course, I was circumcised, Jewish, and they \u2014 I was arrested. They tied me up, my hands behind my back, very tightly and they took me to Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse 9. That was the SS headquarters. And they had a kind of a basement, like a dungeon where they questioned people, not just Jews, even Germans that helped Jews, or others that talked against the regime, they were tortured at that place. And again, according to the archives \u2014 the archives in Germany do not s- say what happened to me when I was arrested April 15\". It only showed that on April 17\", I was shipped to Dachau on a t \u2014 railcar, a train. Well, for t\u2014 two days there, between the 15\" and the 17\", I was tortured, but they didn\u2019t get any information out of me because they beat me and 6*0143 39 things they did, pulling teeth out, I have dentures. Pulling out teeth without any Novocain or anything, and usually I\u2019d pass out, and they finally gave up and stuck me in one of those trains. And that was April 17, according to the archives. And I ended up, after two days roughly, 1-in Dachau, which I believe was the only concentration camp that still was open and there with a route between Berlin and Munich. And of course Dachau was very close to Munich. I never left the train. The train, railcar that I was in was mostly \u2014 were mostly Russian soldiers, men and women soldiers. There were, I think, a couple of kids my age in there and a few other women and men, Germans, Jews, I do not know. Then there were a whole bunch of people on the floor of the train that were already dead, or were trampled to death, or been there a lot longer. I don\u2019t know how long they save, you know, kept the train in Berlin until it was full, completely full. So there were a number of people that I know were dead. There was nothing to eat, no water and no sanitation facilities. And it was \u2014 it was the worst hell I\u2019ve ever been in. And it was either April 19\" or April 20\", I do not know. Again, during th \u2014 fr \u2014 apar \u2014 from the records that were kept, I turned up missing April 20\". It may have been th-the day before. But during and air raid, there was an air raid, and somebody during that air raid opened up the door of the railcar that we were in. Why, I don\u2019t know. I kind of think is that the German guards \u2014 they were SS, they were volunteers to be there, I think knew the allies were right outside the camp because Dachau was liberated April 29\". And this was let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s say this was April 20\". And so I think to be maybe he or she, whoever opened the railcar door figured maybe they\u2019d get better treatment. And so that door opened and whoever was strong enough, jumped out. I followed a bunch of Russian soldiers. There must have been 15 or 20 of them that I followed, and it wasn\u2019t too far. We ended up on a camp where there were nothing but Hitler youth and a few German soldiers. They were not SS, they were German soldiers, and they were teaching the Hitler youth kids how to fire a 6*0143 40 rifle because at that time now they made everybody defend the Motherland \u2014 the Fatherland. And anyhow, the Russians overpowered the few German soldiers. Over half of the Russian soldiers were killed themselves, they were POWs, right, and they didn\u2019t have no weapons. But in groups they just attacked the Germans, and like I say, over half were killed. End of Tape Two, Side A 6*0143 41 Beginning Tape Two, Side B"

            "answer": "Okay, after the Russian soldiers ar \u2014 overpowered the Germans, the Hitler youth, even though they had weapons, but they were so frightened, they just froze. They just looked in awe, and the Russians did shoot every one of the Hitler youth, they killed every one of them. And then they started to move someplace and I wanted to follow them, and they said nein, nein, no you can\u2019t. And so what I did is I looked at the Hitler youth kids that were dead and took off the uniform of one of the kids that was my size and put on that uniform. And I followed the railroad tracks, because I knew there were old Autobahn, the freeway \u2014 not \u2014 not freeway, highway, was right next to the railara \u2014 railroad car. And so I walked towards there and I decided to flag down a car. And the first car that went by was a German SS car, a Mercedes and two SS officers were in. Well, they stopped, and I said I\u2019m \u2014 I need to go back to Berlin, I was at this camp here and Russians came by and they killed everybody. I\u2019m the only one that is left aline, and I want \u2014 a- alive, I want to go back to Berlin and meet \u2014 and go to my mother. And they said come on in, jump in, we have a message for Hitler, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to. Now remember, I didn\u2019t \u2014 the only language I knew was German. I talked like a German, I was German, except they didn't know I was a German Jew. There were numerous roadblocks from Munich to Berlin, however, we were waived through every roadblock because they were again \u2014 I don\u2019t know what rank they were, but they were high in the SS and they had a little sticker on the windshield, and they hardly even ever slowed down for a roadblock, 1t was opened up for them to go through. And they dropped me off at Anhalter Bahnhof, which was \u2014 actually, that was our meeting place where we always said if we get separated, this is where we meet, and \u2014 and every day we\u2019d go and meet 6*0143 42 there. Well, we got to \u2014 I got to Anhalter Bahnhof and there was my mother and brother who almost fainted when they saw me in the Hitler youth uniform. But anyhow, this was \u2014 you see, it\u2019s so close to the war and we did then go to the Noelting, the midwife, we went to her home, and I did change clothes. I didn\u2019t dare stay in the Hitler youth uniform because they could take me like they did take Hitler youth kids and gave them a rifle to defend. So I didn\u2019t want to be in the Hitler youth. In fact, I think my brother and I both, she put Band-Aids on our feet like we were injured, and then put on civilian clothes and that\u2019s really how we lived until the Russians came in."

            "answer": "That\u2019s right. Well, they were so animal-like. They had, like I say, after some pain, I passed out. And by the time \u2014 I was never \u2014 why I didn\u2019t talk, I do not know, I cannot tell you that. Another thing I want to mention, which I think nowadays, I was so thin. I mean when \u2014 after the war, when we lived with the Russians, I think I weighed 50 some pounds and my brother wasn\u2019t much heavier, that those SS who I got the ride with didn\u2019t recognize tha \u2014 how thin I was. I probably looked more like an eight year old than a 11 year old, but they didn\u2019t see that. I think their whole thing was to get to Berlin to let Hitler \u2014 probably what I think happened is because they knew the allies were outside, probably to ask Hitler what should be done. They could have been general officers, I\u2019m \u2014 I don\u2019t know. But, I mean, we practically flew to Berlin.

And I think maybe this Frau Noelting told us whenever things like happen, what to do, I \u2014 I think, but I just knew what I had to do, especially when I couldn\u2019t follow the Russians and here I was all alone. And \u2014 and I decided, well, the only way I\u2019m going to make it is put on the Hitler youth uniform, and hoping that I wouldn\u2019t be forced to take a rifle and start shooting. And again, I didn\u2019t know like, at the time that the allies were out or the \u2014 outside the Dachau camp that the ger \u2014 Russians were outside, I didn\u2019t know that. But I knew, we all knew the war was coming to an end, and we even knew that before I was arrested. We knew it was the end of the war coming. Well, we knew that and th-the word spread. People, Germans that were against the regime weren't afraid to talk any more that much. And I used to hear people say, look at all those tanks there \u2014 to other people \u2014 look at those tanks, there\u2019s not enough gasoline to operate the tanks, they\u2019re out of gas. And so the Germans weren\u2019t quite as afraid any more. But of course afterwards, and I \u2014 I do know women, I know men that would say, oh we\u2019re \u2014 we have a secret weapon. This just when the Russians were really fighting for Berlin, where we were, we have secret weapons and they going to take them, they\u2019re going to kill the \u2014 all the Russians that are coming in. There were still those fanatics around and I heard women say, oh, if these Russians should come in, I\u2019m going to pour boiling water on them. And Pll do everything, they\u2019ll never get me, I'll kill them, and so forth. Of course, after the Russians 6*0143 47 came in, oh how sweet you are. And \u2014 and honestly, the Russians would wa \u2014 rape the women right out in daylight in the street. Again, things I didn\u2019t know until 1t came true. And you know, I had no remorse on those women that used to \u2014 I used to hear in the train station that they are going to kill the Russian, they are going to knife them to death or they\u2019re gonna put boiling waters on them. That\u2019s how they felt then, and then they were friends. So, the Russians that came into Berlin were completely uneducated. They had no common sense, and they were \u2014 in fact, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if those were released prisoners, because the Russian \u2014 I think the front line soldiers were maybe from Siberia, or people that were politically arrested or other \u2014 some reason other arrest. And they were \u2014 they were not the nicest people, and yet to us kids, they treated us well. And of \u2014 of course after Berlin was divided between the Russians, the French, the British and the U.S. troops, we then went to live with this midwife."

But we weren\u2019t the only Germans that wore rags, you couldn\u2019t buy clothing during the war. But anyhow, she got us some clothing and signed us up to a school. And I think she started me in the second grade and my brother in the third grade in Germany. But we only went to that school for about a month or two, and then the British military, they inherited what used to be a\u2014a rest and cu \u2014 recuperation camp outside of Berlin, about three or four hours drive out of Berlin in Luneburg, and where the Germans had a rest and recuperation camp. And they took a bunch of \u2014 at that time now, kids that were either in hiding or in concentration camp, they looked those people up, including my brother and I, and in British ambulances they drove us to this former [indecipherable] camp in Luneburg, where we were nursed \u2014 we were given complete physical examinations and we were nursed back into health. And that is straight \u2014 before we went to that camp, my brother and I then got to know some of the Jewish American soldiers who opened up the synagogue, and this one, Werner Nathan was his name, a private in 6*0143 51 the U.S. Army, and he is the one that actually was responsible in opening up that synagogue at Rosh Hashanah, and he got us in touch, or got the Joint Distribution Committee 1n touch with us, who sponsored us to come to the States. Well, trying to. And while we were waiting to co-come to the U.S., we went to this rest camp that the British sponsored, that should have been for, I think eight weeks. For two months. Well, we were there about three months when a American soldier, not Werner Nathan, some other American soldier came, looked for us and says we are going to be coming to the United States. We have our \u2014 our visas and we\u2019re going to come to the U.S. So we left that camp early, went back to Berlin and he drove us back to Berlin and I don\u2019t know if it was a private vehicle or U.S. Army vehicle, I don\u2019t remember."

And it was an American soldier \u2014 in fact, I think it was that Lieutenant Nowalski(ph) that picked us up from Luneburg, took us back to Berlin and it was \u2014 again, that must have been in late August, because September seventh we left Bremerhaven on the SS Marine Marlin, that was the ship, and went to New York. And besides \u2014 just recently I met an old man in Seattle, who was a seaman on the sister ship of the SS Marine Marlin, who also brought Jewish immigrants to the U.S. And usually people don\u2019t know anything about, never heard of a SS Marine Marlin, and he knew right away, he said that that was his \u2014 the \u2014 his sister ship.

Of course, we didn\u2019t know Canada was a neighbor of the U.S. at the time. But they said 6*0143 63 they will put an ad in the \u201cAufbau\u201d and see if our uncles \u2014 at that time we still thought they were uncles \u2014 if our uncles by any chance were to read that newspaper, as most German speaking Jews were subscribers to that newspaper. Well, our uncles did not read it, but very good friends of theirs in Saint Louis, Missouri read that ad. And there were pages and pages and pages of kids or adults looking for people and most of them \u2014 it was arranged alphabetically, I believe, the ads, and these friends of my uncles, which turned out to be cousins, read that and called them. They were in Saint Louis, and my cousins \u2014 we\u2019|I call them my true things, my cousins from my father\u2019s side, were called up and said there are two kids, just came from Berlin and they are looking for Alfred and Felix tau \u2014 Taucher. And of course that\u2019s when we learned they were cousins. And my cousins were both brothers and they had just, actually not that long ago had come to the U.S., because one cousin lived in Shanghai during the war, while the other one lived in South America. But apparently they had kept in touch all through the war and they ended up in Joplin, Missouri. How they ended up in Joplin, I have no idea. But Joplin is a small community of about 35,000 people, and that\u2019s where they ended up. And since they were in Joplin when we were found, but they were single people, there was no woman in the house, the social welfare agency, Jewish social fe \u2014 agency wouldn\u2019t let us live there and so we went to live with foster parents in Kansas City, Missouri. A family by the name of Levinson, and he was a very Orthodox rabbi and of course very kosher and we lived with them for probably four or five months. But we had really problems living together, because we were not raised Orthodox. And so then we were moved into \u2014 in to another family."

She was Jewish, Mrs. Weinberg, and she worked as \u2014 worked with us \u2014 tutored us to learn English. And what my brother and I did after we started school, we took a German English dictionary and just studied it page by page, word for word. And after awhile it got so that we used words that the English teachers didn\u2019t understand, or we used it in the wrong context. And my brother then \u2014 this was in the ninth grade, I believe, I had a different English teacher than my brother did and my English teacher, she says \u2014 a Miss Ulrichi, she says, Fred, you have to buy some comic books and start reading comic books. I don\u2019t care what comic books you read, but buy comic books and you will have the \u2014 a much \u2014 maybe not the best grammar in the world, but you will get English that is being used every day.

I mean, no 12 year old kid wants to talk about why they were caught. And we didn\u2019t say that we were in a concentration camp, but we just talked what it was life, the bombing and how it was life, living in fear, trying not to get caught.

And took a job with a division of Boise Cascade Corporation, and I set up the very first computer installation for Greystone Concrete Products. Like I say, that was a division from Boise Cascade, it was \u2014 they made concrete blocks and pipe, cement products. And I se \u2014 they had 11 different locations and I set up the computer department in all 11 locations, and then became, besides being the \u2014 what was called the data processing manager, I also was made the assistant controller. And I put in many, many hours and in 1963, a \u2014 this Greystone division, some of the managers bought the division from Boise Cascade, and I was supposed to have been included as one of the owners but they cut me out, strictly the controller of that company, who was als \u2014 see \u2014 embezzling from the company. And of course, being the \u2014 in the accounting department, which was part of the data processing, I knew what was going on. And he cut me out as being a owner of the company. So in 1963, I resigned my position and started my own business, and \u2014 which 1s \u2014 I still have that business.

            "answer": "Well, a good experience is in Seattle just about three weeks ago. Again, like I say, I\u2019m still in the computer business today. One of the things we do is we host websites. The \u2014 we have a election coming up very shortly in Seattle, one of them is for mayor. A man that\u2019s running for mayor is presently the city attorney, who happens to be Jewish, and we are hosting his website. And his website is Sidran for Seattle mayor dot org, dot com, we\u2019ve used all of them. Well somebody who doesn\u2019t like him put up another website and called it Mark Sidran dot com, which is this \u2014 this attorney who 1s running for, his first name. Well, his website is only Sidran for Seattle mayor because Mark Sidran was already taken. Well, that website has a huge swastika, and compares Mark Sidran as a \u2014 a Nazi, as an SS. And it\u2019s somebody that is upset with him. And that \u2014 seeing that swastika bothers me more now than it did when I saw it every day and lived with it in Germany during the regime. Another time \u2014 and I refuse to go back to Munich, Germany \u2014 I \u2014 a few years ago I had a client in Munich and we were doing big business, really, with each other. And finally \u2014 and we always talked over the phone, always in English. This was, of course, back quite some time, before email really, where we sent faxes. We sent faxes back and forth, always in English. And in 1979 I visited him in person. And we had a appointment at 15 minutes before 12 at his place. I got there at 15 minutes before 12, told his 6*0143 76 receptionist who I was, and she said yes, I\u2019ll let Mr. \u2014 I forgot his name now \u2014 I\u2019 Il let him know. And so I waited, and then I asked the receptionist, in English, she spoke pretty good English, I spoke no German at the time. And ask him well, does he have somebody with him, is he busy? She says no, but he must be busy, but he\u2019Il be out. And at exactly 12 o\u2019clock \u2014 and at exactly 12 o\u2019clock he comes out and he starts speaking German to me. Herr Taucher, and used the German pronunciation and didn\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry or anything. And I spoke in English. And he didn\u2019t even know I spoke engli \u2014 German. We never before spoke German, it was strictly a business relationship in English. He spoke very good English when we talked over the phone. His communication in English and on faxes was excellent. And I said, don\u2019t you s-speak English? You know, we\u2019ve been communicating \u2014 yes, bu \u2014 and in German he answers, but you are in Germany, you have to speak German. So I finally said, okay, I'll play your silly game. In German. Of course, that startled him. And the next thing he says, oh it\u2019s 12 o\u2019clock, I have to go lunch. Well, thanks for stopping in. I said goodbye, and I have never communicated with this guy. And we gave him on an average of 70 to 80,000 dollars, U.S. dollars, a month in business. And we gave it to somebody else. And I have found other times in Munich, that is the mentality I find in Munich. Anyplace else, and that includes eastern Germany, I have not found that. The people say in eastern Germany you have a lot of anti-Semitism and so forth, I have not found that myself in eastern Germany. In Munich, yes, I can see kids even, 17 \u2014 18 year old kids giving the Hitler youth \u2014 I-I mean, the Hitler salute. That is completely illegal and in Berlin, in east Germany that\u2019s not permitted and they get arrested. In Munich the police turns around. And I see the Nazi mentality all over again in Munich, and I refuse to go back to Munich."

In fact, that was Himmler\u2019s headquarters, where they also had the torture chamber. And they had some records of me, and I was asked to give a taped interview there. And the first thing, of course I asked, why do you want it for? What do you want it? And this gentleman who I talked to, he was in his middle 30\u2019s, I'd say, he says, well there\u2019s so much denial going on in Germany that we want to get interviews from people that have been here, whether they were Jewish or not Jewish. There were a number of Germans that were also arrested and tortured there, and we\u2019d like to interview every one of them, and then we are s-spreading those tapes through high schools throughout Germany.

Yeah, when I see a swastika, it\u2019s \u2014 it immediately reminds me \u2014 it reminds me of Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse neun, or nine, the torture chamber, what I call. It does remind me. And another thing 1s, like I said, it does remind me right here at the Holocaust Museum, when I am in front of that train, I cannot step foot. ve been reminded of this when I visited Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, and they have that train up there on the stand. And that train that they have there looks just identical to the train that I was in. And I did have some nightmare that night at the hotel in Jerusalem. The rest of it, I can go \u2014 another thing I cannot do, I have actually visited the camp in Dachau once, and really I didn\u2019t have too many problems visiting it. It did give me an idea had I been out of the train what I \u2014 what it would have been like. And I was able to visit that. When I visited Prague a year ago for the Child Survivors of the Holocaust Conference in Prague, they had tours to Theresienstadt and also to Auschwitz. I could not go there. I decided not to go, because I lost a lot of my family in both of those places. Was some first in Theresienstadt and then in Auschwitz. And I decided there\u2019s no way I could go inside Auschwitz. So I chose not to take that tour. And th \u2014 I think in Prague, being in Prague and going through the Jewish cemetery there, even though I had no relatives in Prague, but it sure brought back memories."

And \u2014 but I saw \u2014 I can remember there were soldiers and I saw a few striped jackets, which were prisoners, but that\u2019s about all I remem \u2014 remember of inside the camp. And I think there were only a few privileged prisoners, I think, that could be close to the gate for some reason or another. But other than that I do not remember.

But a lot of survivors, again, they hold a \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a grudge, but they don\u2019t want to forget it, they want to live with the past. And I say hey, you don\u2019t want to forget it, but don\u2019t live with the past. Live with what it is now. A good example is we talked about \u2014 earlier about Liineburg, and this recuperation camp put on by the British. There is one lady, Dodie Jacobson, I believe her \u2014 is her name. She fo-found me in Prague, when we were in Prague and we were at a workshop where we talked about our experiences during the war. And nobody wanted to speak up, and so I was the first to speak, and I was telling my story in Berlin, and my brother and I survived, etcetera. And all of a sudden this one lady, Dodie, interrupted, and she says, were you in Luneburg? And I said yes, my brother and I were there. And she went hysterical, because she is one that was in Luneburg with us. And she was never in a concentration camp, but lived in horrible condition in hiding. And today she has never gotten married, doesn\u2019t want to, can\u2019t get along with people. And again, she said it right at this workshop, she \u2014 there is \u2014 she \u2014 it\u2019s still from her time in Germany. She doesn\u2019t really want to 6*0143 82 make good friends with anybody very long. And again I say, Dodie, these are different times. You gotta live with what\u2019s now. But she doesn\u2019t want to do it. And too many of the survivors live that way, which I think is wrong."

Two years ago when I was in Berlin, and as a \u2014 at the invitation of Berlin; they paid for my trip, they put me up at the Crown Plaza Hotel, that\u2019s a block off the Kurftirstendamm, one of the main thing of it, like Times Square. And wh-while we were having dinner there was a big party going on in the main ballroom. And I\u2019m a curious kind of a person and I looked in, and I see a lot of people with a yarmulke on. So I kind of walked in and I asked somebody there, he was about 19 years old, with 6*0143 83 a yarmulke, and I spoke German with him and I said, what\u2019s going on here? He said, this is a Bar Mitzvah. Do you know what a Bar Mitzvah is? I said yes, and I told him that I lived in Berlin all through the war. I didn\u2019t tell him I was in a concentration camp, I said I am an American now, but I am Jewish.

I am a German, I am a \u2014 Jewish is my religion. And that\u2019s how some of the Jewish community thinks today as a \u2014 that generation, the 19 years and younger generation. They consider themselves German and Jewish. Of course, Jewish is a religion and j \u2014 they should consider themselves as such.

I\u2019m not going 6*0143 84 to do \u2014 eat food that I don\u2019t like. For instance, I never could get used to Oriental food, whether it\u2019s Chinese, Japanese, or what. Even though I was married to a Japanese for over 40 years, I refused to eat Japanese food. I have customers in Japan, I do go to Japan. Every one of my customers know that I will not eat Japanese food and they take me to western foods. I\u2019m a very fussy eater and I just refuse to eat food that doesn\u2019t agree with me or I don\u2019t like. That\u2019s my attitude on food."

I did break this \u2014 I was going to say gentleman, he was not a gentleman \u2014 break his arm. And afterwards the police \u2014 tha-that was in Chicago and one of the detectives from the Cook County police department called me in Seattle and asked me how much I weighed, how tall I was. And I could almost see a smile through this detective\u2019s face over the phone. What happened, the guy that tried to rob me was 180 pounds and six foot tall, and I broke his arm, and his lawyer said I used unnecessary roughness. But I was a little younger at that time, too.

Again I was in the midst of building a business and spending too much time in the business and didn\u2019t take time to write. And then I know I had written him again maybe six months or a year later and the letter came back and no forwarding address. So \u2014 and that\u2019s when we lost track. And he may be \u2014 may have moved out of Newark. But I have tried to look it up on the internet, but unless they have a listed phone number, you can\u2019t find them."

I have found out a lot of survivors, especially in our new group here, have rees \u2014 established their citizenship and I know some people are getting as much as 1100 dollars a month pension from the German government."

For instance, in Seattle we have formed the Survivors of the Holocaust Asset 6*0143 95 Recovery Project. And we are going to join as an affiliate. We\u2019re still separate corporations, but we will be part of the Holocaust Survivors Foundation. And a number of these people, they are all elected officials from their own state, just like I am president of the Washington state group. And \u2014 and a lot of these people have reestablished their German citizenship because now in the U.S., dual citizenship is permitted. And by reestablishing the German citizenship, there is a chance to recev \u2014 receive a pension. And I\u2019m going to take every penny I can get out of the German government."

            "answer": "Well, this is \u2014 I have a real problem with the \u2014 you have the Claims Conference, that has received billions of dollars. In fact, the U.S. government gave them four million dollars. And the \u2014 there are people, especially in Miami that are living out on the street and begging for food, that are concentration camp survivors and not receiving any money. We had, at our meeting two days ago, we had Gideon Taylor, the \u2014 I guess the s \u2014 executive vice president from the Claims Conference talking and say well, half of the survivors are living in Israel, and the Claims Conference also has to look out for the people living in Israel. And we have built memorials. Well, we don\u2019t want memorials. We want money for the people that need it the most, and so we are trying to do something. And first of \u2014 also, the Claims Conference is made up of mostly self appointed people that are not Holocaust survivors. And it should be Holocaust survivors that do 6*0143 96 the distribution of the funds. And that\u2019s what we are working on right now, even if \u2014 if it\u2019s necessary, we will sue the Claims Conference. And they have to release some money because our people are dying. I have the 1999 tax return from the Claims Conference. Oh, I didn\u2019t bring it with me. I didn't bring it with me, but where they had, in the 1999 return, they had a profit, or income of over 247 million dollars. And yet they don\u2019t have money to pay the people that need it the most. That is not right. And Mr. Gideon Taylor, the executive director, in 1999 his salary was 184,000 dollars, plus 35,000 dollars in benefits, I don\u2019t know what those benefits are, plus expense money that we don\u2019t know how much. That shouldn\u2019t be. And we are, our group is trying to do something about it, and that\u2019s why we met here in Washington last November, and just this week. So in fact, I think you said you were at the \u2014 at our meeting place."

I think when they were murdered, they were murdered a little more quickly than what the Germans did. But a \u2014 a lesson learned? No, I\u2019m afraid not.

If you are in military age and you get asked to serve in your military in \u2014 of your country, which appear to be American, U.S., serve, and serve proudly. I feel very strongly again, about the Vietnam war. It was wrong, we all know it was wrong. But for every American that refused to serve, somebody else went and died for it. While Bill Clinton, I thought, forgetting some of his personal problems, as a president he did a fairly good job. He was a real friend towards Israel and the Jews. But I never voted for him and never would vote for him, strictly because he said when he was 13 years old, I think, he said he was going to be president of the U.S.A. someday. And somebody, with that being in mind, avoiding the draft, going to a foreign country, and demonstrating against his own county \u2014 country about the Vietnam war, does not deserve to be a president. And that\u2019s why I never voted for that man. Like I said just earlier, every American man that refused to serve, somebody else went and died for it. Look at me, I was in the U.S. for five years, getting out of hell, but I served my country, and I was proud to serve. My brother served this country, and proud to serve, both of us as officers."

I will say that when my brother and I first came to the States and lived in Kansas City, we for some reason started loving watching cowboy movies. We'd go all over Kansas City, if there was a cowboy movie on like a Roy Roger, or Gene Autry, Johnny McBrown, I can still remember some of those names, we loved to watch those movies. 6*0143 98 And maybe that\u2019s maybe coming back a \u2014 a childhood where kids maybe at the age of 10 would love that.
