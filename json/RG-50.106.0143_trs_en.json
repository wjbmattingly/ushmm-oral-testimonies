But when our father was arrested in 1943, we realized \u2014 and I say we, my brother and I \u2014 realized what was happening. Well, we already realized what was happening back in 19 \u2014 November 9, 1938, Kristallnacht. Of course, I was not quite six years old. I was born in \u201933, January. And then I realized what was happening. And of course the Germans took my father\u2019s store away. They destroyed his inventory. They destroyed his sewing machines. Excuse me. [coughs] They destroyed everything and then forced us to live, again, in a apartment unit there. There were \u2014 I don\u2019t know how many different levels in that building there was, but we had one room below the kitchen.

We could not defend ou-ourselves, even if we were at such an age where we could have \u2014 maybe we\u2019re stronger than those kids that spit at us or kicked us and so forth, but we were not permitted to hit anybody that had a Hitler youth uniform."

If I can say here, last week, of course, was Holocaust Remembrance week. I was asked by the you \u2014 army in Fort Lewis, Washington, to talk about the Holocaust. The army there specifically asked Holocaust survivors, preferably concentration camp ho \u2014 su-survivors that have also been in the U.S. military, preferably in military service. I spent time in the U.S. Army, received a warrant officer commission during my service in Korea and I t-talked about the Holocaust. I did want my brother to talk about the Holocaust, but \u2014 and the reason I wanted him to talk, he spent time in Vietnam, he spent 22 years in the arm \u2014 U.S. Army, retired a major, a much higher ranking officer than me. But he says he just can\u2019t talk about it, he doesn\u2019t remember it and does not want to talk about it.

She used to tell that to my father, to my mother, that Hitler doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Once he learns what\u2019s going on, he\u2019s going to stop that.

And all the people that were at that station started moving \u2014 the s-subways were not running \u2014 on the tracks to another station. And very few of us had anything to eat or to drink. Some people started drinking the water that was stuving \u2014 coming through, and most of those people actually died due to diseases, I think typhoid or whatever it brought. And there were times my brother and I were going to drink it, and we kind of kept each other from drinking it.

And we probably spent \u2014 and my \u2014 our mother was still alive then, and \u2014 who kind of kept us, too, from drinking it. And we got to the other station that was not flooded, and \u2014 but we needed water, and so my mother went outside the station upstairs to a fire hydrant to get water. And she didn't come back down. And I went up and I do remember seeing her lying at the fire hydrant. And actually she was killed, I don\u2019t know if it was German or Russians, but the crossfire between the Russians and the Germans. And so \u2014 and I never could get the water, I was forced to go back down into the subway station by German soldiers. I was a kid, and he forced me to go back down. And I would say that same day, all of a sudden two Russian soldiers came into that subway station with Tommy guns \u2014 machine guns in each hand and everyone \u2014 everyone down in that subway tunnel started clapping. There were a few German soldiers there, they threw down their weapons and surrendered to those two Russian soldiers. And again, this was at Anhalter Bahnhof, which is no longer a subway station, but the station is still there as a \u2014 a memorial, so to speak. And that was the end of the war for us.

I think I may have been on my way to this midwife, Noelting, because she had some groceries for us. And we\u2019d do that, sometimes my brother went to see her. And this was on April 15\", 1945. I was caught in a streetcar. And the reason is they had what I always feared, we all of us feared, an I.D. check. And they had an I.D. check and I had the I.D., I was \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the first name, the last name was Schmitz. But I didn't have my Hitler youth card with me. So again, they make you drop the pants and they knew pretty much if you didn\u2019t have the Hitler youth I.D. you were Jewish. And of course, to a 12 year old having to drop their pants in front of everybody was a humiliation to begin with. And of course, I was circumcised, Jewish, and they \u2014 I was arrested. They tied me up, my hands behind my back, very tightly and they took me to Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse 9. That was the SS headquarters. And they had a kind of a basement, like a dungeon where they questioned people, not just Jews, even Germans that helped Jews, or others that talked against the regime, they were tortured at that place. And again, according to the archives \u2014 the archives in Germany do not s- say what happened to me when I was arrested April 15\". It only showed that on April 17\", I was shipped to Dachau on a t \u2014 railcar, a train. Well, for t\u2014 two days there, between the 15\" and the 17\", I was tortured, but they didn\u2019t get any information out of me because they beat me and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Pulling out teeth without any Novocain or anything, and usually I\u2019d pass out, and they finally gave up and stuck me in one of those trains. And that was April 17, according to the archives. And I ended up, after two days roughly, 1-in Dachau, which I believe was the only concentration camp that still was open and there with a route between Berlin and Munich. And of course Dachau was very close to Munich. I never left the train. The train, railcar that I was in was mostly \u2014 were mostly Russian soldiers, men and women soldiers. There were, I think, a couple of kids my age in there and a few other women and men, Germans, Jews, I do not know. Then there were a whole bunch of people on the floor of the train that were already dead, or were trampled to death, or been there a lot longer. I don\u2019t know how long they save, you know, kept the train in Berlin until it was full, completely full. So there were a number of people that I know were dead. There was nothing to eat, no water and no sanitation facilities. And it was \u2014 it was the worst hell I\u2019ve ever been in. And it was either April 19\" or April 20\", I do not know. Again, during th \u2014 fr \u2014 apar \u2014 from the records that were kept, I turned up missing April 20\". It may have been th-the day before. But during and air raid, there was an air raid, and somebody during that air raid opened up the door of the railcar that we were in. Why, I don\u2019t know. I kind of think is that the German guards \u2014 they were SS, they were volunteers to be there, I think knew the allies were right outside the camp because Dachau was liberated April 29\". And this was let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s say this was April 20\". And so I think to be maybe he or she, whoever opened the railcar door figured maybe they\u2019d get better treatment. And so that door opened and whoever was strong enough, jumped out. I followed a bunch of Russian soldiers. There must have been 15 or 20 of them that I followed, and it wasn\u2019t too far. We ended up on a camp where there were nothing but Hitler youth and a few German soldiers. They were not SS, they were German soldiers, and they were teaching the Hitler youth kids how to fire a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And anyhow, the Russians overpowered the few German soldiers. Over half of the Russian soldiers were killed themselves, they were POWs, right, and they didn\u2019t have no weapons.

            "answer": "Okay, after the Russian soldiers ar \u2014 overpowered the Germans, the Hitler youth, even though they had weapons, but they were so frightened, they just froze. They just looked in awe, and the Russians did shoot every one of the Hitler youth, they killed every one of them. And then they started to move someplace and I wanted to follow them, and they said nein, nein, no you can\u2019t. And so what I did is I looked at the Hitler youth kids that were dead and took off the uniform of one of the kids that was my size and put on that uniform. And I followed the railroad tracks, because I knew there were old Autobahn, the freeway \u2014 not \u2014 not freeway, highway, was right next to the railara \u2014 railroad car. And so I walked towards there and I decided to flag down a car. And the first car that went by was a German SS car, a Mercedes and two SS officers were in. Well, they stopped, and I said I\u2019m \u2014 I need to go back to Berlin, I was at this camp here and Russians came by and they killed everybody. I\u2019m the only one that is left aline, and I want \u2014 a- alive, I want to go back to Berlin and meet \u2014 and go to my mother. And they said come on in, jump in, we have a message for Hitler, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to. Now remember, I didn\u2019t \u2014 the only language I knew was German. I talked like a German, I was German, except they didn't know I was a German Jew. There were numerous roadblocks from Munich to Berlin, however, we were waived through every roadblock because they were again \u2014 I don\u2019t know what rank they were, but they were high in the SS and they had a little sticker on the windshield, and they hardly even ever slowed down for a roadblock, 1t was opened up for them to go through.

Well, we got to \u2014 I got to Anhalter Bahnhof and there was my mother and brother who almost fainted when they saw me in the Hitler youth uniform. But anyhow, this was \u2014 you see, it\u2019s so close to the war and we did then go to the Noelting, the midwife, we went to her home, and I did change clothes. I didn\u2019t dare stay in the Hitler youth uniform because they could take me like they did take Hitler youth kids and gave them a rifle to defend. So I didn\u2019t want to be in the Hitler youth. In fact, I think my brother and I both, she put Band-Aids on our feet like we were injured, and then put on civilian clothes and that\u2019s really how we lived until the Russians came in."

And by the time \u2014 I was never \u2014 why I didn\u2019t talk, I do not know, I cannot tell you that. Another thing I want to mention, which I think nowadays, I was so thin. I mean when \u2014 after the war, when we lived with the Russians, I think I weighed 50 some pounds and my brother wasn\u2019t much heavier, that those SS who I got the ride with didn\u2019t recognize tha \u2014 how thin I was. I probably looked more like an eight year old than a 11 year old, but they didn\u2019t see that. I think their whole thing was to get to Berlin to let Hitler \u2014 probably what I think happened is because they knew the allies were outside, probably to ask Hitler what should be done. They could have been general officers, I\u2019m \u2014 I don\u2019t know. But, I mean, we practically flew to Berlin.

But I knew, we all knew the war was coming to an end, and we even knew that before I was arrested. We knew it was the end of the war coming. Well, we knew that and th-the word spread. People, Germans that were against the regime weren't afraid to talk any more that much. And I used to hear people say, look at all those tanks there \u2014 to other people \u2014 look at those tanks, there\u2019s not enough gasoline to operate the tanks, they\u2019re out of gas. And so the Germans weren\u2019t quite as afraid any more. But of course afterwards, and I \u2014 I do know women, I know men that would say, oh we\u2019re \u2014 we have a secret weapon. This just when the Russians were really fighting for Berlin, where we were, we have secret weapons and they going to take them, they\u2019re going to kill the \u2014 all the Russians that are coming in. There were still those fanatics around and I heard women say, oh, if these Russians should come in, I\u2019m going to pour boiling water on them. And Pll do everything, they\u2019ll never get me, I'll kill them, and so forth. Of course, after the Russians This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And \u2014 and honestly, the Russians would wa \u2014 rape the women right out in daylight in the street. Again, things I didn\u2019t know until 1t came true. And you know, I had no remorse on those women that used to \u2014 I used to hear in the train station that they are going to kill the Russian, they are going to knife them to death or they\u2019re gonna put boiling waters on them. That\u2019s how they felt then, and then they were friends. So, the Russians that came into Berlin were completely uneducated. They had no common sense, and they were \u2014 in fact, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if those were released prisoners, because the Russian \u2014 I think the front line soldiers were maybe from Siberia, or people that were politically arrested or other \u2014 some reason other arrest. And they were \u2014 they were not the nicest people, and yet to us kids, they treated us well. And of \u2014 of course after Berlin was divided between the Russians, the French, the British and the U.S. troops, we then went to live with this midwife."

And I don\u2019t recall us visiting either one of those stores right after the war, before we came to the States.

And it didn\u2019t change much, and I just, a year ago in berli \u2014 in April, a year ago when I was in Berlin, I did visit it and of course there\u2019s the one on Leipne(ph) strasse was for rent and the one on Petsalozzi(ph) strasse, there was a Chinese family living there and also they had a store of Chinese artifacts and souvenir type items. In fact, I stopped and talked with them. Their son, it so happened, graduated from the University of California, spoke pretty good English and I talked with him for probably close to an hour. And he found it very interesting that as a child I was living at that place, at a \u2014 it did some \u2014 was some major remodeling done and more space.

And it was an American soldier \u2014 in fact, I think it was that Lieutenant Nowalski(ph) that picked us up from Luneburg, took us back to Berlin and it was \u2014 again, that must have been in late August, because September seventh we left Bremerhaven on the SS Marine Marlin, that was the ship, and went to New York. And besides \u2014 just recently I met an old man in Seattle, who was a seaman on the sister ship of the SS Marine Marlin, who also brought Jewish immigrants to the U.S. And usually people don\u2019t know anything about, never heard of a SS Marine Marlin, and he knew right away, he said that that was his \u2014 the \u2014 his sister ship.

But Joplin is a small community of about 35,000 people, and that\u2019s where they ended up. And since they were in Joplin when we were found, but they were single people, there was no woman in the house, the social welfare agency, Jewish social fe \u2014 agency wouldn\u2019t let us live there and so we went to live with foster parents in Kansas City, Missouri. A family by the name of Levinson, and he was a very Orthodox rabbi and of course very kosher and we lived with them for probably four or five months.

Well, when I took the entrance examination for the University of Missouri, apparently my score on the English part of the test was above average. And I was told that I cheated because the results of the test score was much higher than it possibly could have been with the lack of education I have had and the short time that I have been in the U.S. I did ask to take the test over again, but back in 1951 that was not done. At \u2014 times have changed today. But so \u2014 since I could not go to the University of Missouri, I didn\u2019t really know what I wanted to study then, because my goal was to be a lawyer, just like my parents wanted me to be a lawyer, my brother to be a dentist. And so I was 18 and a half years old, or almost. They were just starting to draft 18 and a half year olds, so I decided to join the army and get that out of my \u2014 out of my life here.

So, of course I agreed to that interview and I had probably a 45 minute interview there, all in German, so that high school kids can fully understand it."

When I visited Prague a year ago for the Child Survivors of the Holocaust Conference in Prague, they had tours to Theresienstadt and also to Auschwitz. I could not go there.

And she went hysterical, because she is one that was in Luneburg with us. And she was never in a concentration camp, but lived in horrible condition in hiding. And today she has never gotten married, doesn\u2019t want to, can\u2019t get along with people.

First of all, in Seattle, we did not have the problems there that you have had in other parts of the country. For instance, we\u2019ve had Afro-American mayors in s \u2014 in \u2014 1n Seattle. Exec \u2014 the present county executive is a \u2014 1s a black man. And lately here we\u2019ve had a few more problems, but that is because we get these activists coming in, not even from Seattle, that demonstrate on \u2014 any time there\u2019s something going on, starting when we had that WTO there.

The mayor, even though \u2014 the present mayor, even though I supported him, Paul Schell, is not very strong. The previous police chief, the present police chief is not very strong. And if anything I am an activist now to get those people out.

And my C.P.A. is a Sephardic Jew, also speaks Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, he speaks about seven languages. And the former governor is an American, but he is from Italian parents. In fact, a book has been written on him. And my C.P.A., Victor Barkey(ph) introduced me to Governor Rosellini, and they have been long, long friends, and they always speak Italian together.

I didn't bring it with me, but where they had, in the 1999 return, they had a profit, or income of over 247 million dollars. And yet they don\u2019t have money to pay the people that need it the most. That is not right.

While Bill Clinton, I thought, forgetting some of his personal problems, as a president he did a fairly good job. He was a real friend towards Israel and the Jews. But I never voted for him and never would vote for him, strictly because he said when he was 13 years old, I think, he said he was going to be president of the U.S.A. someday. And somebody, with that being in mind, avoiding the draft, going to a foreign country, and demonstrating against his own county \u2014 country about the Vietnam war, does not deserve to be a president.

But I included quite a number of the second generation, I had seminars that both second generation and survivors could attend, because I found out some \u2014 a lot of the second generations wanted to be involved and hear from other survivors than just their parents. And so I did include a number of activities the second generation, and my daughter did attend a lot of the sessions."
