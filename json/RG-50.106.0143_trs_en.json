If I can say here, last week, of course, was Holocaust Remembrance week. I was asked by the you \u0152 army in Fort Lewis, Washington, to talk about the Holocaust. The army there specifically asked Holocaust survivors, preferably concentration camp ho \u0152 su-survivors that have also been in the U.S. military, preferably in military service.

And we got to the other station that was not flooded, and \u0152 but we needed water, and so my mother went outsi de the station upstairs to a fire hydrant to get water.

A nd so \u0152 and I never could get the water, I was forced to go back down into the subway station by German soldiers. I was a kid, and he forced me to go back down. And I would say that same day, all of a sudden two Russian soldiers came into that subway station with Tommy guns \u0152 machine guns in each hand and everyone \u0152 everyone down in that subway tunnel started clapping.

And I told my brother I saw our mother, she was up at the fire hydrant, bu t the Germans wouldn\u2122t let me get to it, and I think she is okay, but I don\u2122t know. That\u2122s really what I told him. And I didn\u2122t know, I \u0152 it was just the way I felt. And of course we never did see her again. And, in fact, up to this day, I do not know if she was killed or injured because the Russians took a lot of \u0152 especially women and USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143 38 children, they loaded them on truck and s-shipped them to Russia, especially women. In fact, after the war my brother and I were loaded onto trucks many times to be \u0152 to go to Russia, but we knew Berlin like a book, we \u0152 there wasn\u2122t an address we couldn\u2122t find. And we, for awhile were guides to some of the Russian o fficers going from point A to point B."

            "answer": "Yes. We didn\u2122t \u0152 we didn\u2122t cover that. Yes, again, like I said, we moved around freely under false I.D., and again in a streetcar, and I was there by myself. I think I may have been on my way to this midwife, Noelting, because she had some groceries for us. And we\u2122d do that, sometimes my brother went to see her. And this was on April 15th, 1945. I was caught in a streetcar. And the reason is they had what I always feared, we all of us feared, an I.D. check. And they had an I.D. check and I had the I.D., I was \u0152 I don\u2122t rememb er the first name, the last name was Schmitz. But I didn't have my Hitler youth card with me. So again, they make you drop the pants and they knew pretty much if you didn\u2122t have the Hitler yo uth I.D. you were Jewish. And of course, to a 12 year old having to drop their pants in front of everybody was a humiliation to begin with. And of course, I was circumcised, Jewish, and they \u0152 I was arrested. They tied me up, my hands behind my back, very tightly and they took me to Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse 9. That was the SS headquarters. And they had a kind of a basement, like a dungeon where th ey questioned people, not just Jews, even Germans that helped Jews, or others that talked against the regime, they were tortured at that place. And again, according to the archives \u0152 the archives in Germany do not ssay what happened to me when I was arrested April 15 th. It only showed that on April 17th, I was shipped to Dachau on a t \u0152 railcar, a train. We ll, for t \u0152 two days there, between the 15 th and the 17th, I was tortured, but they didn\u2122t get any info rmation out of me because they beat me and USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143 39 things they did, pulling teeth out, I have dentures. Pulling out teeth without any Novocain or anything, and usually I\u2122d pass out, and they finally gave up and stuck me in one of those trains. And that was April 17, according to the archives. And I ended up, after two days roughly, i-in Dachau, which I believe was the only concentrati on camp that still was open and there with a route between Berlin and Munich. And of course Dachau was very close to Munich. I never left the train. The train, railcar that I was in was mo stly \u0152 were mostly Russian soldiers, men and women soldiers. There were, I think, a couple of kids my age in there and a few other women and men, Germans, Jews, I do not know. Then th ere were a whole bunch of people on the floor of the train that were already dead, or were trampled to death, or been there a lot longer. I don\u2122t know how long they save, you know, kept the train in Berlin until it was full, completely full. So there were a number of people that I know were dead. There was nothing to eat, no water and no sanitation facilities. And it was \u0152 it was the worst hell I\u2122ve ever been in. And it was either April 19th or April 20th, I do not know. Again, during th \u0152 fr \u0152 apar \u0152 from the records that were kept, I turned up missing April 20 th. It may have been th-the day be fore. But during and air raid, there was an air raid, and somebody during that air raid opened up the door of the railcar that we were in. Why, I don\u2122t know. I kind of think is that th e German guards \u0152 they were SS, they were volunteers to be there, I think knew the allies were right outside the camp because Dachau was liberated April 29 th. And this was let\u2122s \u0152 let\u2122s say this was April 20 th. And so I think to be maybe he or she, whoever opened the railcar door figur ed maybe they\u2122d get better treatment. And so that door opened and whoever was strong enough, jumped out. I followed a bunch of Russian soldiers. There must have been 15 or 20 of them that I followed, and it wasn\u2122t too far. We ended up on a camp where there were nothing but Hitler youth and a few German soldiers. They were not SS, they were German soldiers, and they we re teaching the Hitler youth kids how to fire a USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143 40 rifle because at that time now they made ev erybody defend the Motherland \u0152 the Fatherland. And anyhow, the Russians overpowered the few German so ldiers. Over half of the Russian soldiers were killed themselves, they were POWs, right, and they didn\u2122t have no weapons. But in groups they just attacked the Germans, a nd like I say, over half were killed. End of Tape Two, Side A USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143 41 Beginning Tape Two, Side B"

            "answer": "Okay, after the Russian soldiers ar \u0152 overpowered the Germans, the Hitler youth, even though they had weapons, but they were so frightened, they just froze. They just looked in awe, and the Russians did shoot every one of the Hitler youth, they killed every one of them. And then they started to move someplace and I wanted to follow them, and they said nein, nein, no you can\u2122t. And so what I did is I looked at the Hitler youth kids that were dead and took off the uniform of one of the kids that was my size and put on that uniform. And I followed the railroad tracks, because I knew there were old Autobahn, the fr eeway \u0152 not \u0152 not freeway, highway, was right next to the railara \u0152 railroad car. And so I walked towards there and I deci ded to flag down a car. And the first car that went by was a German SS car, a Mercedes and tw o SS officers were in. Well, they stopped, and I said I\u2122m \u0152 I need to go back to Berlin, I was at this camp here and Russians came by and they killed everybody. I\u2122m the only one that is left aline, and I want \u0152 a-alive, I want to go back to Berlin and meet \u0152 and go to my mother. And they said come on in, jump in, we have a message for Hitler, that\u2122s where we\u2122re going to. Now remember, I didn\u2122t \u0152 the only language I knew was German. I talked li ke a German, I was German, except they didn't know I was a German Jew. There were numerous roadblocks from Munich to Berlin, however, we were waived through every roadblock because they were again \u0152 I don\u2122t know what rank they were, but they were high in the SS and they had a little sticker on the wind shield, and they hardly even ever slowed down for a roadblock, it was opened up for them to go through. And they dropped me off at Anhalter Bahnhof, which was \u0152 act ually, that was our meeting place where we always said if we get separated, this is where we meet, and \u0152 and every day we\u2122d go and meet USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143 42 there. Well, we got to \u0152 I got to Anhalter Ba hnhof and there was my mother and brother who almost fainted when they saw me in the Hitl er youth uniform. But anyhow, this was \u0152 you see, it\u2122s so close to the war and we did then go to the Noelting, the mi dwife, we went to her home, and I did change clothes. I didn\u2122t dare stay in the Hitler youth uniform because they could take me like they did take Hitler youth kids and gave them a rifle to defend. So I didn\u2122t want to be in the Hitler youth. In fact, I think my brother and I both, she put Band-Aids on our feet like we were injured, and then put on civilian clothes and that\u2122s really how we lived until the Russians came in."

            "answer": "That\u2122s right. Well, they were so animal-like. They had, like I say, after some pain, I passed out. And by the time \u0152 I was never \u0152 why I di dn\u2122t talk, I do not know, I cannot tell you that. Another thing I want to mention, which I think nowadays, I was so thin. I mean when \u0152 after the war, when we lived with the Russians, I think I weighed 50 some pounds and my brother wasn\u2122t much heavier, that those SS who I got the ride with didn\u2122t recognize th a \u0152 how thin I was. I probably looked more like an eight year old than a 11 year old, but they didn\u2122t see that. I think their whole thing was to get to Berlin to let Hitler \u0152 probably what I think happened is because they knew the allies were outside, probably to ask Hitler what should be done. They could have been general officers, I\u2122m \u0152 I don\u2122t know. But, I mean, we practically flew to Berlin.

And I think maybe this Frau Noelting told us whenever things like happen, what to do, I \u0152 I think, but I just knew what I had to do, especially when I couldn\u2122t follow the Russians and here I was all alone. And \u0152 and I decided, well, the only way I\u2122m going to make it is put on the Hitler youth uniform, and hoping that I wouldn\u2122t be forced to take a rifle and start shooting. And again, I didn\u2122t know like, at the time that the allies were out or the \u0152 outside the Dachau camp that the ger \u0152 Russians were outside, I didn\u2122t know that. But I knew, we all knew the war was coming to an end, and we even knew that before I was arrested. We knew it was the end of the war comi ng. Well, we knew that and th-the word spread.

And I used to hear people say, look at all those tanks there \u0152 to other people \u0152 look at those tanks, there\u2122s not enough gasoline to operate the tanks, they\u2122re out of gas. And so the Germans weren\u2122t quite as afraid any more. But of course afte rwards, and I \u0152 I do know women, I know men that would say, oh we\u2122re \u0152 we have a secret weapon. This just when the Russians were really fighting for Berlin, where we were, we have secret weapons and they going to take them, they\u2122re going to kill the \u0152 all the Russians that are coming in.

And I\u2122ll do everything, they\u2122ll never get me, I\u2122ll kill th em, and so forth. Of co urse, after the Russians USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143 47 came in, oh how sweet you are. And \u0152 and honestl y, the Russians would wa \u0152 rape the women right out in daylight in the street. Again, thi ngs I didn\u2122t know until it came true. And you know, I had no remorse on those women that used to \u0152 I used to hear in the train station that they are going to kill the Russian, they are going to kni fe them to death or they\u2122re gonna put boiling waters on them. That\u2122s how they felt then, and then they were friends. So, the Russians that came into Berlin were completely uneducated. They had no common sense, and they were \u0152 in fact, I wouldn\u2122t be surprised if those were released prisoners, because the Russian \u0152 I think the front line soldiers were maybe from Siberia, or people that were politically ar rested or other \u0152 some reason other arrest. And they were \u0152 they were not the nicest people, and yet to us kids, they treated us well.

Of course, we didn\u2122t know Canada was a neighbor of the U.S. at the time. But they said USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143 63 they will put an ad in the \ufb01Aufbau\ufb02 and see if our uncles \u0152 at that time we still thought they were uncles \u0152 if our uncles by any chance were to read that newspaper, as most German speaking Jews were subscribers to that newspaper. Well, our uncles did not read it, but very good friends of theirs in Saint Louis, Missouri read that ad. And there were pages and pages and pages of kids or adults looking for people and most of them \u0152 it was arranged alphabetically, I believe, the ads, and these friends of my uncles, wh ich turned out to be cousins, read that and called them.

But Joplin is a small community of about 35,000 people, and that\u2122s where they ended up. And since they were in Joplin when we were found, but they were single people, there was no woman in the house, the social welfare agency, Jewish social fe \u0152 agency wouldn\u2122t let us live there and so we went to live with foster parents in Kansas City, Missouri.

One of the things we do is we host websites. The \u0152 we have a election coming up very shortly in Seattle, one of them is fo r mayor. A man that\u2122s running for mayor is presently the city attorney, who happens to be Jewish, and we are hosting his website. And his website is Sidran for Seattle mayor dot org, dot com, we\u2122ve used all of them. Well somebody who doesn\u2122t like him put up another we bsite and called it Mark Sidran dot com, which is this \u0152 this attorney w ho is running for, his first name. We ll, his website is only Sidran for Seattle mayor because Mark Sidran was already taken. Well, that website has a huge swastika, and compares Mark Sidran as a \u0152 a Nazi, as an SS. And it\u2122s somebody that is upset with him. And that \u0152 seeing that swastika bother s me more now than it did when I saw it every day and lived with it in Germany during the regime. Another time \u0152 and I refuse to go back to Munich, Germany \u0152 I \u0152 a few years ago I had a clie nt in Munich and we were doing big business, really, with each other. And finally \u0152 and we always talked over the phone, always in English. This was, of course, back quite some time, befo re email really, where we sent faxes. We sent faxes back and forth, always in English. And in 1979 I visited him in person. And we had a appointment at 15 minutes before 12 at his place. I got there at 15 minutes before 12, told his USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143 76 receptionist who I was, and she sa id yes, I\u2122ll let Mr. \u0152 I forgot his name now \u0152 I\u2122ll let him know. And so I waited, and then I asked the receptioni st, in English, she spoke pretty good English, I spoke no German at the time. And ask him well, does he have somebody with him, is he busy? She says no, but he must be busy, but he\u2122ll be out. And at exactly 12 o\u2122clock \u0152 and at exactly 12 o\u2122clock he comes out and he star ts speaking German to me. Herr Taucher, and used the German pronunciation and didn\u2122t say I\u2122m sorr y or anything. And I spoke in English. And he didn\u2122t even know I spoke engli \u0152 German. We never before spoke German, it was strictly a business relationship in English. He spoke very good English when we talked over the phone. His communication in English and on faxes was excellent. And I said, don\u2122t you s-speak English? You know, we\u2122ve been communicating \u0152 yes, bu \u0152 and in German he answers, but you are in Germany, you have to speak German. So I finall y said, okay, I\u2122ll play your silly game. In German. Of course, that startled hi m. And the next thing he says, oh it\u2122s 12 o\u2122clock, I have to go lunch. Well, thanks for stopping in. I said goodbye, and I have never communicated with this guy. And we gave him on an average of 70 to 80,000 dollars, U.S. dollars, a month in business. And we gave it to somebody else. And I have found ot her times in Munich, that is the mentality I find in Munich. Anyplace else, and that includes eastern Germany, I have not found that. The people say in eastern Germany you have a lot of anti-Semitism and so forth, I have not found that myself in eastern Germany. In Munich, yes, I can see kids even, 17 \u0152 18 year old kids giving the Hitler youth \u0152 I-I mean, the Hitler salute. That is completely illegal and in Berlin, in east Germany that\u2122s not permitted and they get arrested. In Munich the police turns around.

So I kind of walked in and I aske d somebody there, he was about 19 years old, with USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143 83 a yarmulke, and I spoke German with him and I sa id, what\u2122s going on here?

I am a German, I am a \u0152 Jewish is my religion. And that\u2122s how some of the Jewish community thinks today as a \u0152 that generation, the 19 years and younger generation.

In fact, the U.S. government gave them four million dollars. And the \u0152 there are people, especially in Miami that ar e living out on the street and begging for food, that are concentration camp survivors and not receiv ing any money. We had, at our meeting two days ago, we had Gideon Taylor, the \u0152 I guess the s \u0152 executive vice president from the Claims Conference talking and say well, half of the survivors are living in Israel, and the Claims Conference also has to look out for the people living in Israel. And we have built memorials. Well, we don\u2122t want memorials. We want money fo r the people that need it the most, and so we are trying to do something. And first of \u0152 also, th e Claims Conference is made up of mostly self appointed people that are not Holocaust survivors. And it should be Holocaust survivors that do USHMM Archives RG-50. 106*0143 96 the distribution of the funds. And that\u2122s what we are working on right now, even if \u0152 if it\u2122s necessary, we will sue the Claims Conference. A nd they have to release some money because our people are dying. I have the 1999 tax return from the Claims Conferen ce. Oh, I didn\u2122t bring it with me. I didn't bring it with me, but where th ey had, in the 1999 return, they had a profit, or income of over 247 million dollars. And yet they don\u2122t have money to pay the people that need it the most. That is not right. And Mr. Gideon Tayl or, the executive director, in 1999 his salary was 184,000 dollars, plus 35,000 dollars in benefits, I don\u2122t know what those benefits are, plus expense money that we don\u2122t know how much. Th at shouldn\u2122t be. And we are, our group is trying to do something about it, a nd that\u2122s why we met here in Washington last November, and just this week.

While Bill Clinton, I thought, forgetting some of his personal problems, as a president he did a fairly good job. He was a real friend towards Israel and the Jews. But I never voted for him and never would vote for him, strictly because he said when he was 13 years old, I think, he said he was going to be president of the U.S.A. someday. And somebody, with that being in mind, avoiding the draft, going to a foreign country, and demonstr ating against his own county \u0152 country about the Vietnam war, does not deserve to be a president.
