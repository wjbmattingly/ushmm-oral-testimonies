Some research \u2014 he was interested in the pituitary gland, and I did some resear \u2014 some translations for him, and I think maybe \u2014 maybe he was the guy who wrote the letters, I don\u2019t know who wrote the letters. But the way this happen is that one of the John Hopkins professor, by the name of Maxwell Winthrop \u2014 he was a hematologist, you know, at John Hopkins, became chairman of the department of medicine in Utah. Now why \u2014 how that happened was that Utah before the war had a two year medical school. And then after two years, they had to go usually to Chicago to finish medical school. Now, because of the war, they decided to make a four year medical school, and then they had to get chairmen \u2014 you know, professors. And they got this, the Maxwell Winthrop from John Hopkins as a professor of medicine. And I think that he was Jewish, and I think that they approach him, and Maxwell Winthrop had relation with the Jewish community in \u2014 in Salt Lake City, and Interview with Harry Iticovici *\u00b0 August 24, 2010 the Jewish community there had a fund that was left by somebody from Colorado, a Jewish businessman or something, for scholarships or something like this, and they decided to give me a scholarship. And this 1s the way this [indecipherable]. But that\u2019s not only what happened. It\u2019s \u2014 to come as a student in those days to this country, not only that you had to have some kind of a scholarship, but there had to be a guarantee from somebody, that if you run out of money, they will contribute for your expenses in school and so on, so that you don\u2019t remain penniless. And they c \u2014 this was done by a family of eye doctors in \u2014 in Baltimore. They did the guarantee, but they didn\u2019t give me any money or something.
