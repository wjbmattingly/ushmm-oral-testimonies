My grandfather\u2019s full of stories, he just tells and I treasure them because he\u2019s a great storyteller. He composed a book of vignettes, and over two years ago I read that, it\u2019s coming out soon. And I\u2019ve heard a lot orally, and I\u2019ve read a lot.

            "answer": "It occurred to me to go to Poland and the surrounding area, but it would have been part of more of an organization or a program like the March of the Living, rather than to explore his childhood. But I think it would be interesting to see where he grew up, but I don\u2019t know what remnants there are."

            "answer": "Well, I always picture my grandfather as a heroic -- I see him mostly as a partisan fighter. He was the partisan fighter for a period of time and then he joined the Russian army, but that\u2019s the image I picture him, and he\u2019s told me heroic war stories and the like, and that\u2019s what comes to mind when I think of him. And my grandmother, she\u2019s told me stories too, and she was beautiful, and I just picture her as the charmer she was, as she went as a -- she masqueraded as a Pole.

One was where he was -- he was shot five times by his friends who turned on him, and he\u2019s obviously still alive today. And he has the bullet wounds to show, and -- but he -- I never heard so much of the atrocities that happened during the war, only much later, now. And I learned a lot more about them through my own reading, because I\u2019m also very interested in the Holocaust, I\u2019ve read more than several books over -- on the issue, I\u2019ve seen movies, and through them I\u2019ve gotten a more complete picture.

            "answer": "I actually -- I -- I went to a parochial school, and surprisingly they didn't teach very much about the Holocaust, I\u2019m assuming because they took it for granted that people understood what it was. We only briefly touched upon it in eighth grade. We didn\u2019t have a very general history course. But I\u2019m aware that a lot of my friends that have gone up through the system in the public schools, they -- they know -- they know about what the Holocaust 1s. They\u2019ve learned about it.

I -- I feel that I know a lot, a lot more about the Holocaust, and about all -- not all the aspects, but a lot more of the aspects than my friends, or than I was taught in school. And even in the books that I\u2019ve read, because I have my grandfather to talk to, and whenever I had a question or -- I talked to him and I got firsthand feedback."

He came to my brother\u2019s school, which was my old day school, but I was- this was last year, so I must have been -- was either -- I was either a sophomore or junior.

If I ever had a friend, Interview with Dustin Dezube \u00b0 December 7, 2000 which I haven\u2019t, but if someone made light of it, then I would. I do talk about my grandparents because, as I mentioned earlier, they\u2019re just spectacular people.

            "answer": "I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m listening to them differently, because I feel that I have a very strong connection to them. But I\u2019m positive they had a much more profound influence on her just because she lived under them, and she must have told you in the other tapes. And I was just more removed from living with them, and they came up and when they came up, I -- you know, I had to finish all the food on my plate. But she had to live with that, so in that way I think she was more profoundly affected.
