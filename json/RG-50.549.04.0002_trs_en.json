He was the partisan fighter for a period of time and then he joined the Russian army, but that\u2122s the image I picture him, and he\u2122s told me heroic war stories and the like, and that\u2122s what comes to mind when I think of him.

I was always closer to her than my father. And I used to play games with her and chess and every night she used to sing me Shema and she used to read to me. I\u2122m very close to her. A couple -- and part of it was because I had a girlfriend that was, in addition to being non-Jewish, not really the nicest of people. And my mom and her didn't get along at all. And that, maybe my mom\u2122s work, other aspects led to tension and for the last year or so things have become more tense and she\u2122s had a shorter fuse and been more irate. But now I -- now that I broke up with her, my -- my ex-girlfriend now, I feel that things are getting -- you know, they are much better. I\u2122m very close to my mom again, I hardly fight. With my dad also, I don\u2122t -- we used fight all the time, it used to be an issue of he\u2122d say do this, I\u2122d no, I don\u2122t want to. Now, I -- I -- I help out.
