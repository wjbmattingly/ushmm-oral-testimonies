My grandfather\u2019s full of stories, he just tells and I treasure them because he\u2019s a great storyteller. He composed a book of vignettes, and over two years ago I read that, it\u2019s coming out soon. And I\u2019ve heard a lot orally, and I\u2019ve read a lot.

He was the partisan fighter for a period of time and then he joined the Russian army, but that\u2019s the image I picture him, and he\u2019s told me heroic war stories and the like, and that\u2019s what comes to mind when I think of him. And my grandmother, she\u2019s told me stories too, and she was beautiful, and I just picture her as the charmer she was, as she went as a -- she masqueraded as a Pole.

One was where he was -- he was shot five times by his friends who turned on him, and he\u2019s obviously still alive today. And he has the bullet wounds to show, and -- but he -- I never heard so much of the atrocities that happened during the war, only much later, now. And I learned a lot more about them through my own reading, because I\u2019m also very interested in the Holocaust, I\u2019ve read more than several books over -- on the issue, I\u2019ve seen movies, and through them I\u2019ve gotten a more complete picture.

We only briefly touched upon it in eighth grade. We didn\u2019t have a very general history course.

I -- I feel that I know a lot, a lot more about the Holocaust, and about all -- not all the aspects, but a lot more of the aspects than my friends, or than I was taught in school.

She\u2019s very understanding. We -- as I child, I -- I must have -- you know, I -- she was always the one that would buy me clothes and take me to get a haircut. I was always closer to her than my father. And I used to play games with her and chess and every night she used to sing me Shema and she used to read to me. I\u2019m very close to her. A couple -- and part of 1t was because I had a girlfriend that was, in addition to being non-Jewish, not really the nicest of people. And my mom and her didn't get along at all. And that, maybe my mom\u2019s work, other aspects led to tension and for the last year or so things have become more tense and she\u2019s had a shorter fuse and been more irate.
