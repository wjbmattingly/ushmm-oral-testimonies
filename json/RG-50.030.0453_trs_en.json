And it\u2122s very interesting that I escaped from Czechoslovakia act \u0152 in 1968 and \u212269, after the Russian came in, I went from \u0152 I escaped illegally, with two suitcases. I left every [indecipherable] everything there for the government. Then [indecipherable] were sentenced in absentia to two years in prison because we left illegally \u0152 legally they didn\u2122t let you. So we left like for vacation. It was very hard to get, because we went from Czechoslovakia to Hungary, from Hungary to \u0152 to Yugoslavia . From Yugoslavia to Austria. In Vienna we registered in the HIAS in the Jewish immigration office. There we st ayed about for two weeks, and they send us to Rome , to Italy, where is the main concentration of refugees, especially of Jewish refugees on the HIAS. And by the way, I was there working in Rome , we stayed in Rome 15 months approximately, because I was working on hire \u0152 they Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7, 1997 11hired me, after three months I started to speak Italian, because I had learned it in gymnasium when I went, so I learned very easy. So I was working one year in HIAS in Rome , like an interpreter. So I stayed 15 months, you know \u0152 and by the way, I used to go the first time, after 22 years to go to a shul, to a synagogue, because in Czechoslovakia , first of all, we to \u0152 under communism it was very dangerous to show that you are religious , or you going \u0152 secondly, there was no Jews, so I didn\u2122t have the opportunity to go. So I went to a little shul there in Rome, and suddenly I took a prayer book and I found in the prayer book a card what was a ticket, a steady ticket, a year\u2122s ticket for my father for the streetcars in Prague. Can you imagine? And I had here the card, not long time ago, and I am very sorry, I cannot find. I was looking, and I don\u2122t remember if I gave it to the Holocaust museum here in Detroit, or I put somewhere. And I had the card for many years, and I\u2122m sorry, otherwise I would give the card to you, to show that it was \u0152 and when I was in Rome, and they called me the first time to the \u0152 I had \u0152 had the aliyah, to show \u0152 to called me to the Tora h. And I was very fluent, I remember, because I wa \u0152 go back to how it was in Czechoslovakia and was praying. So I said the first brocha by the aliyah very fluently. And suddenly, when I had to continue, suddenly I stopped and I couldn\u2122t get a word from my mouth. And they thought, the people who are standing next to me, they thought that, what\u2122s happened? What\u2122s Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7, 1997 12hap \u0152 and it took me about two minutes to ga \u0152 get \u0152 continue because I was \u0152 I was so excited, and for me was \u0152 is so something that I cannot imagine, I couldn\u2122t imagine that after so many years I\u2122m standing in fr ont of the Torah by a-aliyah. So then I told them, so they told me they can understand that. So that what it happened to me in Rome. And I wanted only to say that in Czechoslovakia , because it was very dangerous to have some prayers or to go to a shul. So I had the prayer book, and my father gave me the idea \u0152 we had th e drawer in our dresser. And behind the back of the drawer, in the wall, in the back of the dresser was a little space. So I put the prayer book in back of the drawer, and besi \u0152 behind the drawer, I put a plywood, so when you opened the drawer, you couldn\u2122t see nothing in the back. And from the back I made a little hole, a small hole that you can push down the \u0152 the plywood with a wire. So it was a small \u0152 and when I opened the drawer and I pushed the \u0152 with th-the wire the plywoo d, so the plywood came down and I took my prayer book. So at least on the high holidays, approximate, I knew where they are, so I was praying, because otherwis e what \u0152 when my sister escaped from Czechoslovakia with her husband in 1948, and then my other sister with her husband in 1950, illegally, and I gave some money out, I helped them. So then it was very dangerous because the police came after me. I was in \u0152 even in custody for \u0152 for a few days, and they even slapped me because I didn\u2122t want to tell them h- Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7, 1997 13ho \u0152 which way my sist er escaped and left Czechoslovakia . So, then I \u0152 so I knew that was genderus \u0152 dangerous to pray, so that\u2122s way \u0152 and I knew that exactly, at least twice during the time in those year, in 1950 - \u212251, maybe \u212252, the secret police came during the day when we were in [indecipherable] my wife at work, they were checking my a \u0152 our apartment for certain things they will find, because \u0152 especially my wife, she realized \u0152 she opened, for example there, her underwear was, that it was put a different way back, or our other things what we had in our drawers, or in the \u0152 in our \u0152 in our clos et. So that\u2122s \u0152 we knew exactly they were secretly \u0152 they came to our apartment to check, and to make \u0152 if they will find something against me. Maybe they were mo re times than twice, but twice we knew exactly for sure. So when I \u0152 they took me many times, about three times I wa \u0152 I think, to the secret police, and they were even telling me, if I won\u2122t tell how the \u0152 my sister went, and what connections I ha ve with my sisters overseas in the west, that they will send me to J\u00e1chymov. This was very a dangerous [indecipherable] it was uran-uranium \u0152 uranium m-mine, that th ey were sending the worst criminals or politically who are dangerous for them. And most of the people even died then in those mines, or if they after many years they were lucky, came back, their whole \u0152 their life \u0152 they were sick with \u0152 from the uran \u0152 from \u0152"

But in one way actually, the labor camp saved my life, because if I would be home like my brother, I would be registered, and I would g-go to concentration camp.

And my wife \u0152 my father actually, made arrangement that I will go to Hungary too, because it was safe.

So I \u0152 he gave me some money, and the next morning, because it wa s a holiday, he came to the jail and told this guy, listen, I heard here you have a \u0152 someone who had some infection. I have to check him. So, he gave immediately, be cause my father gave some money to the doctor, he gave a little money to this guy, he let him in. He get \u0152 take a look at me, and he really saw \u0152 I can you show me, ev en today I have a scar, and he showed \u0152 took a [indecipherable] and he showed the guards and said, look, this is red and swollen, I have to take him immediately to the hospital to take \u0152 to open it. And you can tell the g \u0152 the \u0152 the Hlinka guard or someone that I took him out and they can see him in the hospital. So he took me to the hospital, immediately he opened it. He made a big \u0152 a big bandage on it. I don\u2122t ev en remember if he freeze it or not, but probably, because I felt some pain immediately. And he put me in a room, and immediately aft \u0152 in the afternoon, there came two guardists(ph), one [indecipherable] police, and what immediately called the doctor, the doctor went with he \u0152 with them to the room, and they told him \u0152 he told them, look, I cannot leave him, he has temperature \u0152 and I rea lly had temperature, because it was really Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7, 1997 43an infection [indecipherable]. And I cannot even open the wound. I have here the papers of what I wrote down, what I did to him. And you have to wait til take, two or three days til he can get out, or I will see what\u2122s happen, because it\u2122s so dangerous that he can die even, a so dangerous infection. So it took I don\u2122t know how long because they were arguing with him there in the office. So they let me down. And every five or six hours came a guardist, or a policeman to check if I am there. And can you imagine? I swear to you that it\u2122s true what I am telling you. The next morning, when it was right after the holiday, early in the morning, all the 29 people too \u0152 they took away \u0152 that went to concentration camp. And after the war, I met only one of them. He was originally from Lithuania, but he lived in Slovakia after t \u0152 about two years, about three year s. And he told me, as far as he knew, immediately in 1942 \u0152 for \u0152 for \u0152 1943, 22 people, they\u2122re shot or died in Auschwitz. And he survived, and ya \u0152 as sla \u0152 as far as he knows, he said, I don\u2122t know if someone else survived. So then I stayed in the hospital about 10 days, and then they let me go because the \u0152 the older people left already. So \u0152 but they had my name, so that\u2122s where I went war \u0152 in hiding and so on. And I was suspicious because they had my name that I tried to go to Hungary . So that\u2122s a other story what \u0152 I don\u2122t know if I told the whole story."

The one was \u0152 had the bakery, he was collaborating with the partisans, so he baked bread for the partisans, and always send it, or we came down and took from him bread.

And in October, I came down around six o\u2122clo \u0152 after six o\u2122clock, and on the end of the village, because I had to go to him, to this guy for some information I needed, and I\u2122m supposed to be there about half an hour and then go back. And they \u0152 on the end of the village were soldiers, German soldiers already, identification. So I show the identification, and he says, yeah bu t, this is after six o\u2122clock, I have to teta-take you inside \u0152 it was a school, there is the kommandatura , to make proof that you are \u0152 so \u0152 and I went there, there was a captain, a German captain. And, identification ev-everything, and I \u0152 he said , what I\u2122m doing there? And I said what I am doing, I am here and buying fruit with this and this guy, and they are buying this [indecipherable] for the \u0152 for mu\u0131t and for [indecipherable] for the Slovakian, the German army. You know what he did? And this guy, this Christian guy knew me, he saw me once, cause I was there one evening with two other guys, we need some information from him. And he let [indecipherable] this guy, he didn\u2122t know for \u0152 what he is calling for. And he came in this \u0152 yeah, first of all, he ca \u0152 he asked me, the German captain if I understand German. And I said no. And he said how come y-you knew \u0152 he know s that I had German study in the school. And I said, yes, we had German, but it was many years ago, but usually we didn\u2122t \u0152 there were very few conversations, so now I forgot. He gave a German soldier who Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7, 1997 47actually was from the Sudetenland, so he spoke a little Czech. So he was the translator, so I had always a little \u0152 and I spoke fluently German. So he always \u0152 the captain ask the soldier to ask me certain que stion. So I \u0152 I had always a few seconds or a minute maybe, time to think about the answer. So, before the questions, he questioned me about for 15 minutes or 20 minutes or so. And he asked me what I am doing, so I said this guy \u0152 this guy \u0152 I am buying all on those hills fruit, and we make mu\u0131t and all the say \u0152 cider for the army. You know, he glad to call this guy, he came in this room. When he saw me he almost collapsed, because he knew actually who I am, he knew that I am with partisans. So he ask the following question, this guide \u0152 this guy. Tell me, is it true that this guy who stays here, he is buying fruit with you for the army? You can imagine, he says yes. Immediately they let him go, and he let go the notary from the city to check my papers if they are not false. And the notary, he is to \u0152 still, because this is the \u0152 where the partisans were, and I was staying, mostly was 85 or 90 percent not Catholic. They were Evangelics , Protestants. The notary came and the \u0152 and the commandant, the captain showed him the paper, are these really papers, are not false? And the notary said no, they are correct, they are hundred percent real. And they let him \u0152 they let me go, they told me listen, even it\u2122s only seven o\u2122cloc k, but I let you go because I told them where I live, because I cannot let you here during the night. And I said okay. It was Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7, 1997 48about seven o\u2122clock in the evening, or 7:15. They [indecipherable] soldier, they [indecipherable] me to the guard there, and let me go. A second time, it was April the 13th, 1945, I came again the same place, and they \u0152 it was in five o\u2122clock or 4:30 in the morning. No, I mean, I\u2122m sorry, in the afternoon about five o\u2122clock, I made the \u0152 because I thought that six a \u0152 after six o\u2122clock I cannot be there. So he says, I still \u0152 I have to take you to the kommandatura , but in this time there\u2122s other arm \u0152 other \u0152 I don\u2122t know, hi-higher than a capta in, I don\u2122t know what it was. It was the army who actually were moving back be cause the front was coming, it was very close. You could hear the shooting and ev erything. So he took me there and he showed \u0152 and I thought \u0152 I told him that I didn\u2122t know that I\u2122m with all \u0152 because I lived there and there, outside, and I wanted to visit, I wanted to buy some food still, because there was no food, because there wasn\u2122t stores, because there were places what you have no stores, nothing, five six houses, nothing else. So \u0152 and in \u0152 by the way, both cases, I was lucky that not the one, not the first one didn\u2122t tell me to pull the pants down. I wa \u0152 I-I don\u2122t know, it was a miracle."

So we heard that are concentration camp, but was in later, in 1944 or something like that. And by th e way, this like, is not hear because I \u0152 I don\u2122t know if you want to put on tape. Ab out four years ago, my wife said \u0152 alee \u0152 that we are reading the \u0152 we are receiving a Czech newspaper, it comes from New York, what are news from Czechoslovakia and so on. And one day we saw a article there that some Jews who are even outside Czechoslovakia and who can prove that they were in concentration camp, or in the army with th-the Russians always there, England . They can get some compensation, because the Germans sent some money to the Czech re \u0152 Czechoslovakia, and it will be like some compensation because they were in concentration camp. So my wife said, look, maybe \u0152 and she was \u0152 she was very fluent in Czech corresponding as a \u0152 because she was a clerk in Czechoslovakia \u0152 and by the way, we have a Czech typewriter. I Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7, 1997 63don\u2122t know how it happened, bu t we bought away from a \u0152 during a friend or so on, we had the Czech writer, because the alphabet in Czech is a little different. So she says, you know what? I will try to write application for some people. Maybe they will get. And I do \u0152 I thou \u0152 I mentioned to my brother-in-law, and he said to a friend of ours. So we wrote application, and really was happen, and we had t-to write the first application to the Ministry of Defense. They will prove \u0152 they could prove if you have \u0152 that you were like pe rsecuted in a labor camp. And then they give a paper, so-called law number 255. Th is is a law, a Czechoslovak law what recognized that you were persecuted, and you were eligible in certain advantages. For example, like I have the 255, I \u0152 and I get because I worked in Czechoslovakia more than 25 years, I have pension, because I am eligib le on normal pension. And I\u2122m better, if I get the normal pension, that I will get compensation through the Germans. So we wrote them, and I received the 255, and then we made the application for the Czechoslovak Social Se curity, because they give the money. And th-that proved tha-that he was persecuted and were recei ving the money. And in the pens \u0152 you have to have a affidavit from a doctor that he has certain illnesses, and he has \u0152 he has invalidity, 10 percent, 50 percent, 100 \u0152 and he gets certain amount of money. And we have about five people already. And some get 35 dollars a month, some get 60 dollars a month. An d in one occasion he get 110 dollars a Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7, 1997 64month, and were received through backwards for half a year, or year, or th-th \u0152 thousand dollars, or 1200 dollars, besides what \u0152 and they receiving every month, even today. So \u0152 and I n eeded addresses for certain concentration camp, because you have to prove that th-they were in concentration camp. So I went here, to the Holocaust Museum, and get out maybe 30 or 26 addresses, even from small concentration camps. And what the people to ld us, there were this concentration camp, this cencontra \u0152 well, from the [indecipherable] from the concentration camp, they were sent to work in a factory. The factory actually received people to work from the sod \u0152 concentration camp. It was for a hundred people, 150 people. So I went there into the da \u0152 and suddenly, when these people received the money, he said \u0152 the one friend told to the othe r friend you wouldn\u2122t believe, we are almost 50 people, what we made applications fro m \u0152 beside that, two years ago came new laws in Czechoslovakia , so it\u2122s more complicated. You need more proof, more papers. So I went to the library in the Holocaust Museum, I took all the addresses, because we had to write to all those concentration camp. We write in Polish, we write in English, we write in German. And to the international cross in Arles, and in all over. And all the peoples are coming, so there are proof there were some da \u0152 and I\u2122ll have to translate from English to Czech, from German to Czech, from Polish to Czech, from Russian to Czech and I am doing all these things, and I have Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7, 1997 65\u0152 I\u2122m translating. I am going to notarize my signature that I translated. So you cannot imagine what a work, what we would \u0152 if you \u0152 if you would know that it takes so long, we wouldn\u2122t do it. And you know what, we don\u2122t take money from those people, and we are doing this free. Some people when they receive the paper gave us, I don\u2122t know, they gave us 20 dollars or so, or nothing, we don\u2122t ask the money, because they see how much work it has. So what I wanted to say, I went to the con \u0152 to the labor \u0152 to the Holocaust Museum. Suddenly I saw a thick two books. And I saw people \u0152 can you stop for a moment? I bring you to show you something. [break] It runs?"

So they saw a woman with children, they immediately sent to the oven. So, it was \u0152 and then women realized, even it was heartbreaking, so they let the children, separate the children, and they survived , because they didn\u2122t go with the children, otherwise they would go to the chimney \u0152 to the ove n, too. So the children \u0152 anyhow, very few survived. And my sister [indecipherable] was here. She went from Hungary to concentration camp and she was lucky, because she went with some cousins. And she was, in this time she was 14 and a half years old. And so the women were \u0152 they were \u0152 the SS came many times to look for children, so they were hiding her in concentration camp. And they were \u0152 they were so malnutritious they don\u2122t \u0152 didn\u2122t have any food, so other women brought pieces of bread only to get here to give her, or I don\u2122t know, if they found something, a little milk or something.

So the other people were \u0152 even when they know that they\u2122re going \u0152 looking for children Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7, 1997 73or for something.

And he was in \u0152 died next to me, I saw he wa \u0152 and usually, when someone died, even it was a German or a Russian or a \u0152 or a Slovak or so, usually, especially it was close to a village or so, and they knew already they went, because the people used to go to the forest there and so they saw some dead Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 7, 1997 80people, so they buried them. They buried th em there, or they took them to the cemetery. Anyhow, so I don\u2122t know here \u0152 where he was buried. Can you imagine? Life you know, the \u0152 the li \u0152 the human life is so unpredictable. And in 1946, I met his sister, she survived the Holocaust. She was a year younger than he was. And it was hard for me, and I met her in \u0152 in Prague . And she somehow \u0152 I don\u2122t know if she knew us, we were talking and talking, and then we were talking about the brother. And he was \u0152 she was really susp icious that I knew about him, or she [indecipherable] us. And then I told him, you know, Vera, I was with your brother during the war. And she hold my hand and she says, Mitu(ph), tell me what happened to him. I couldn\u2122t talk for a moment. And I told her, you know, I am sad to tell you, that in November 1944 he wa s hurt and he died like a partisan. She hugged me. And that was in a restaurant. We were crying. Can you tell me where he is buried? And I told her, Vera, I am sorry to tell you that I cannot tell you, because I know it was in the forest, it was like out of the forest, it was like a free space, but usually the people were \u0152 are buried, thos e people, I cannot tell you, but I know it was about 10 kilometers from Kleiner(ph), 12 kilometers. But I ge \u0152 well, it was very hard. And the next year, in 1947, I think she moved there to Australia. And I don\u2122t know what happened to \u0152 then with her, she \u0152 I don\u2122t \u0152 she got married there. So tha-that\u2122s was the other story, sad story.

Maybe some people, if someone would \u0152 I would meet, or someone would \u0152 someone come along from Medzilaborce, they will remember the name for sure. Because there in Medzilaborce , this is a \u0152 a smaller city than Michalovce, but was some Jews, maybe sa \u0152 some hundred Jews for sure. Very religious city, it was, a very Orthodox.

You know, this is how to \u0152 you know, can\u2122t remember everything, ever what\u2122s happened.

            "answer": "So, we were waiting because then, after \u0152 few weeks after the war, I was waiting, I went back to Michalovce, and was looking. So then I saw a \u0152 after few weeks, my one sister came back, Haide(ph), some times in June, I think. And then I heard someone came from Budapest, that my younger sister is alive. So we were waiting for it, you know, after few days or few weeks, the other sister, who lives here in Detroit , Tullulah(ph), came back, so we met together in Michalovce , but Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 97we didn\u2122t know what to do. And then we had \u0152 if I ca n continue now after the war, we had the aunt in Vranov, this was about 35 miles from Michalovce , she was a first cousin of my father. So she heard \u0152 they were looking and someone \u0152 I don\u2122t remember how \u0152 if she heard about us, or we heard about her. Actually, we went there to Vranov , to her, with her. We stayed there from \u0152 for awhile, and she says that we can stay there, we will look if someone from the family will come back or not. So then I had a friend in Michalovce who was me \u0152 who was we \u0152 with me together in labor camp. And he to ld me that he has a uncle in Liberec. This is about 65 miles north of Prague. And he has a wholesale store here they gave him back, the Czechoslovak government, becaus e he had this wholesale store before the war, in hardware store and plumbing supply. So \u0152 and this was my profession what I was working during the war. So he somehow connected with him, and he told me he was looking for someone wh o is responsible, and who is \u0152 who can trust for \u0152 and who can trust, may \u0152 and I can get the job there. So I went there and introduced myself, and he hired me. So it was in January \u0152 exactly in January 1946. And between the \u0152 this time what we in \u0152 in Vranov, in Michalovce , we went to Prague end of the year to look for someone if we were \u0152 some on the Jewish organizations, if they will give some on the Red Cross, if they will give some \u0152 some i-information about our family members, but we didn\u2122t get anything. So my sister went back to Vranov. They were there for a few months, and I stayed Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 98the Liberec already, I started to work there. And then \u0152 but I [indecipherable] and then in \u0152 in Prague , I met some cousins from Slovakia, from Orlich(ph), who were in Prague , stayed in Prague , and one of them was \u0152 one brother of this cousins, he was in the Czechoslovak army in Russia, and he came to Prague , was sometimes in middle s-summer, sometimes in August or September. So \u0152 and because he was ma \u0152 a soldier in the Czechoslovak army in Russia, he was fighting through the front and everything. So they had advantages that they gave those people who was in the concentration camp, or who was fighting against the German, like partisans or \u0152 or in the military, that he can get certain stores or factories, what it \u0152 after there was took over from the Germans. So this two cousins actually were received, they get a store in Jablonice(ph). This was about eight miles from Liberec. It was a store what \u0152 with china, you know, with glass, china, so [indecipherable] . So then my sisters came over to Jablonice(ph), sa \u0152 first they stayed with me in Liberec for many, many months, maybe a year or so. And I \u0152 in ma \u0152 my sist er, yeah, she stayed in Liberec the whole time. And then my younger sister started to date, actua lly it was the brother of my cousin. And they get married in 1948, and my sis \u0152 other sister, she started to date her next husband, a Mr. Joe Dushinski(ph). So she get married, and they stayed in Liberec til end of 1950 or the 1950s, when they escaped from Czechoslovakia and went to Germany, from Germany to Canada and from Canada to the United States. My Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 99younger sister Lola, when she got married in 1948, end of 1948, yeah. He went \u0152 they went, I think with the Haganah to Germany and to France , to Paris where they stayed there about I think for two years or so, I don\u2122t remember exactly. And then they made corresponding because we had many relatives, first cousin, aunts and uncles here in the United States . So actually, they helped them, that after two years or so they gave them a \u0152 th-they received a visa to Canada. They stayed there for a few months or so, and then they received a visa, they came here to the United States. Between this time, my other sister Haide(ph), with her husband, they escaped [indecipherable] money, I gave some money because he have to like bribe and give money for someone who kn ew the way to go to the border, to german \u0152 to east Germany. And they went to Berlin, and from ber \u0152 from east Berlin to have \u0152 to have tams \u0152 again for money, they went to west Berlin, and waiting for the papers the same way they received from our relatives the paper, the visa, because they were first cousin and uncles. They went to Canada , they came to Windsor , ma \u0152 first to Halifax, I think. They stayed there from Halifax to Windsor , and then after I don\u2122t know, for I think it was in 1952 or \u212251 or something like that, they came to the United States, to Detroit, because here in Detroit, we have the \u0152 a cousin here, who was born here in the United States ."

First came Ko\u0131ice, 1945, they established a new democratic Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 101Czechoslovak government. Then, after a few weeks, they came to Prague with a big celebration, everything, because it\u2122s again the new Czechoslovak government. But what had happened, the Russians, actually Stalin, even during the war, and it was the fault of the American government of Roosevelt, actually, and Truman, that they would trust \u0152 they trusted to Stalin, and even in 1945 they made the agreement in Tehran , Stalin with Churchill and Roosevelt, that how far the American army, when they will liberate Europe and Germany and other, how far they can go. Because actually Prague, and the mostly part of Czechoslovakia , the American army was actually on the outskirts of Prague , and the Russian didn\u2122t let them farther to go, and the Russians were far away, because they said it was agreement between Russia and the United States. So the American army had to pull back, move west approximately to the city of Posen in Czeska (ph) Budavitsa(ph) and then they stayed.

I was about four or five times there on the police, asking questions, a \u0152 who \u0152 ho-how many relatives I have in America, where I have relatives, what I am doing, what I \u0152 my corresponding is, with whom I am corresponding and so on. And then in the 1950, my sister Haide(ph) what \u0152 she left Czechoslovakia , that was a nightmare for me, because then they took me again to the police, and they hold me for a few days, two t \u0152 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 106three days. Even in that it happened that I get pushed to the wall. Then even a day \u0152 a slap my fa \u0152 I get a slap on my face that I ha-hold my own hand. I don\u2122t know if I even told my wife some ta \u0152 this. Then they let me \u0152 this wasn\u2122t so easy because I wanted to go. They told me that I knew how my sister, both sister left Czechoslovakia and til I won\u2122t tell them, they will keep me and they will send me to J\u00e1chymov . That was a uranium mine, when they put the ra \u0152 uranium from mines, and all the uranium was sending to Russia, because they made that \u0152 probably the atomic bomb or so. And usua lly people who went \u0152 that was people who were sent to J\u00e1chymov to the uranium mines, that was criminals, that was poli \u0152 who were politically \u0152 politically no-not trustworthy, and very few people came back from there. They died. And if after many, many years someone came back, his health was completely \u0152 they get \u0152 they have cancer when they came back, most of them died, and very few survived more years in there, they let her go after fef \u0152 15 or 20 years, or someti mes it happened wher e they saw someone get very sick and had some connections, so they let him go, but still \u0152 they let him go home, but after many year \u0152 after a fe w years died because of cancer from the uranium, from the exposures to \u0152 to radiation."

            "answer": "Very much so. And I can tell you, I have to mention maybe that they let me go after a few days or so, if \u0152 it was because my wife, she was working in an office, and her president of the office wi \u0152 because it was a \u0152 for the \u0152 the main office for all the restaurants there, it was about 1500 people. He had some connection, the \u0152 her boss had some connection w ith the police. So my wife probably told him, so he actually, through my \u0152 my wife, through him, heard that the police let me go. But that\u2122s later on, like I mentioned, my wife later on couldn\u2122 t keep high position jobs because they knew that her husband has relatives in America, so they didn\u2122t trust her. So then, later on she was only like a clerk, because before she was in a higher position, like a \u0152 in charge of th e personnel department, from all the people. Then they \u0152 they \u0152 she couldn\u2122t keep this job, because they didn\u2122t trust her. So actually, they put her in a lower position there. But they needed her because, I have to tell, she was a very good clerk, she was very smart and very capable to do things. And her boss was great, because she did many work what she \u0152 he\u2122s supposed to job \u0152 do. So ac tually, he didn\u2122t have to work so much, and other people who were in charge. So actually, they used her to work more because the-they knew that she has to if she wants to keep even the lower job. So but \u0152 like I mentioned before, we knew that after years and many times the police were watching us specially. And like I mentioned before, the last time, we knew exactly the \u0152 why they came to our apartment when we were at work and were checking Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 108well \u0152 if they will find some letters or something, some material what they can use special against me, that I am in connection somehow with my sisters, or with relatives in America."

            "question": "You mean they searched \u0152 they searched your house while you were \u0152",
            "answer": "Re \u0152 re \u0152 they searched our house. Maybe they were mare \u0152 money \u0152 more times, but twice we knew exactly because w-we, like I mentioned, in our closets we recognized, we knew, because w-we knew \u0152 we heard that they are doing this kind of work, the secret police, so we \u0152 exactly on purpose, we put certain things in our closets that we could then recognize that something \u0152 someone was there. And so the \u0152 actually, all those years, we were living with my wife, we couldn\u2122t travel so much like we would like to. And they were watching \u0152 they were watching us, all our steps. Because we were feeling and we saw suspicious people around us, along the \u0152 outside our apartment and so, because they were watching who is coming to our apar tment. Maybe they are watching where we are going, with whom we are friends, with whom we are in connection. So that was [indecipherable] that was the reason \u0152 and in 1968, then \u0152 my sister \u0152 I\u2122m a little too far a-ahead, but in 1968 is when my sister\u2122s family \u0152 because here in the family, like I think I mentioned, was a Bar Mitzvah in the family and a wedding in the family, here in Detroit and in Chicago. So, after \u0152 they sent me airline ticket, and I \u0152 invitation that I could come to vi sit. But they \u0152 I knew in advan \u0152 yeah, Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 109between the older [indecipherable] once a year and twice a year, my sister \u0152 I received a letter from one sister, from th e other sister. But in this time, in Czechoslovakia they had the qui \u0152 equipment, because someone told me later on after years, that they could read the letters who wanted \u0152 who \u0152 special letters who came from the western countries. So actually, before I got the letter, and it was a certain stamp, a letter stamp on the envelope, so actually they, under the secret police, maybe in Prague already, or in Liberec , they actually read all the letters what I received. So they knew what they \u0152 what th-they are writing. And this taught me \u0152 someone later on af \u0152 sometime in the 60s, I think he was in the secret police, I am not sure, but I knew he \u0152 I went to school with him. And he \u0152 one day he was drunk, and I met him, so \u0152 and he st arted to talk and I was asking him, so I felt between his word what he was talking, that that \u0152 that\u2122s what the police, because he told me actually, they said, look, we knew everything, what\u2122s going on everybody, because we knew in a \u0152 everything what\u2122s going on because we had equipment what we [indecipherable] . So, in 1968 when I came here, it took me a lot of work, because I couldn\u2122t get the visa to America before I get the permission, a paper from the police in Liberec that they let me go for a visit. So \u0152 and it took again th-the boss of my wife, he talked to someone of the police, so that\u2122s where I could get the permission, and I went with the permission to the American embassy in Prague, that\u2122s when I could get the visa. But they never let Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 110go a couple together, special when they didn\u2122t have children, and we didn\u2122t have children. So actually I knew in advance b ecause when my sisters wrote me that they will invite us, so I told them in advance, they cannot \u0152 we couldn\u2122t get both of them. If I will lucky, I will get probably, but they had to pa \u0152 send the invitation only for one person, for me. And that\u2122s what happened. And I knew for exactly because they told me, you know, in the police when I went with \u0152 with the invitation what I received from my sister, I went to the police, as they told me, immediately. But it\u2122s \u0152 if we will decide, it will go only to you, not \u0152 but not your wife. Because they knew we didn\u2122t have children. So \u0152"

            "answer": "Yeah, for visiting? Yeah, I-I was \u0152 when I went to the United States, I was certain that more, more, more, because the Dubek were in charge already that many more they \u0152 the western countries will help Czechoslovakia to get more rid of the communist-like government, that it will be some imperialistic government, or more democratic government, so that I will come back. I didn\u2122t \u0152 I didn\u2122t go to United States with this that I will stay here, because if it would be a year before, I would do that, because I kne w under communist that I-I would be glad to get rid of the communist government, but now, if starting in spring of 1968 it goes always farther, farther, more liberalization, more democratic things started to come. So everybody thought it will finally get again a democratic Czechoslovak Republic. But in \u0152 with th \u0152 in this time, and [indecipherable] in the United States, it was for six weeks what I get the permission. That means the third or the second of September I was supposed to go back, and that was even my airline ticket. But in thi-this time, end of August, the 21st of August, I think, th \u0152 the communists, the Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 113Russian and the army from Hungary, from East Germany, from Romania, from Poland , occupied Czechoslovakia, so they closed the borders. So I was in the United States, my wife was actually over there. So, what I have to do? So \u0152 and my wife was in this time in Yugoslavia , on vacation with her cousin, be a \u0152 with a 10 years old boy. So, she immediate \u0152 when the Czechoslovakia occupied, so she immediately went from Yugoslavia back to Czechoslovakia because the parents of the boy were afraid that \u0152 what\u2122s happened. So they \u0152 she went back to Czechoslovakia . I was in the United States , she was over there. And then when what\u2122s happened, so my relatives all, they told me look, we are going to the immigration office. You will stay here, be cause what\u2122s happened there. We will do everything possible that your wife will come here too. And then, because I told them, I don\u2122t want to stay here if she is there, I am here. So my brother-in-law went with me here in Detroit to the immigration office, and they told me \u0152 I didn\u2122t speak English, so he was the interpreter. They told me yeah, we can make now because this situation is, it will be easier that I could stay here, and we will make everything possible if she can get out from Czechoslovakia , that she will receive immediately visa. But we cannot guarantee how she will get out from there. So I said look, I will go back, I will do \u0152 if I will be there \u0152 because it ose \u0152 and they said don\u2122t worry, they will let her go as soon as we\u2122ll go to phone her, we will write her. She will get the permission, she will get out. And I said look, if the Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 114Russians are \u0152 if it would be a government under Dubek, it will be different, but this is a government the Russians are ther e. And I know what it means to live under communists. So never they would let her go \u0152 maybe after awhile or so. And I said, I cannot \u0152 I cannot stay here, I cannot let her there because she doesn\u2122t know all those ways how to go sh \u0152 there. She has no experience in this kind of thing, and I have to go back. The-They we re crying, they were bul \u0152 everything, my relatives. And I went back. And when \u0152 interesting enough, one of my nephews \u0152 because I \u0152 one nephew, he had Bar Mitzvah in July here. So I was at the \u0152 the other nephew, his Bar Mitzvah suppo sed to be in April next year. And he was crying and crying, and said, Uncle Mitu (ph), you are here at the Bar Mitzvah for Stanley, and you won\u2122t be here on my Bar Mitzvah, and I will \u0152 and I told him, Irwin(ph), I promise you, I will do everything possible. When I will be there, I will make all the possible things \u0152 if I couldn\u2122t be here on your Bar Mitzvah, I will be here with you on your wedding with your aunt, with my wife. I make this your promise. And so I went ba ck, but I couldn\u2122t go straight to Czechoslovakia , so I flew from here to Yugoslavia , because I had to change my airline ticket, and I went to the place where my wife was on vacation, she wasn\u2122t there any more. So I went back by train to Prague, and then I met my wife and saw \u0152 and I told her the story and I said, I will try immediately I told her, I will try everything. We have to go back and we have to go to America. We cannot stay because it will be a terror Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 115here. So, she didn\u2122t want for, she was crying and so on. But then later on th \u0152 I was working on her [indecipherable] and then she saw too what\u2122s going on, how it goes, the situation. So and then we made, sometimes in March, we start with a little more, not so strict like it was the first month. So we went to \u0152 to police, we ask for a permission to go to Hungary for vacation. Yeah, when I came back, people \u0152 friends what I met on the street, th ey didn\u2122t even greet me to welcome me or something. Everyone only showing knock on the head that I was so st \u0152 they didn\u2122t te \u0152 tell me anything, only to show me that I was stupid that I came back. So then we was working in ma t \u0152 thr \u0152 thr \u0152 again through ma \u0152 through this \u0152 her boss, and we get permission to go to Hungary because we had some friends. And then we had to bribe in the bank, because you ca \u0152 to go to Yugoslavia. If you wanted to go to Yugoslavia , you had to get a permission from the bank, that the bank gave you currency, Yugoslavian cu rrency, that you go to a vacation for Yugoslavia . So that \u0152 we bribed some clerk in the bank, because it was always a committee who was deciding if they allowed you, if they give you the money, Yugoslavian money that you go \u0152 can go to Yugoslavia. So that\u2122s what it happened, I-I get the permission to go to yu \u0152 th-the money to go into Yugoslavia . So I went again to the police, I had the permission to Yugoslavia , actually [indecipherable] needed. I get the permission there, because I had the per \u0152 the money from Yugoslavia. So I get the per-permission from the police that I can go. Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 116They put up a \u0152 a stamp in my passport that I can go Yugoslavia. And then we have to bribe someone on the police to a \u0152 a friend of mine. We gave money to him, he gave some money to a policeman. So he gave permission to us that we can go to Yugoslavia through Austria. And it was for 48 hours. And I had the cousin who still lives in Czechoslovakia , in Ko\u0131ice, and she told me that if I can get the permission to Austria, to Vienna, then I can go to HIAS, to a Hebrew immigration office, and then I can stay and they take care of me to get out from Europe , anywhere. So that what we did to, what I\u2122m saying it\u2122s very simple, but it took much of nerves, a lot of weeks, almost all our money what we got. It cost us money what we bribe. And it was nerve breaking til we get all those papers and everything. So only one cousin of my wife, and my cousin in Ko\u0131ice , they knew that we are preparing to leave. Even she told me my cousin in Ko\u0131ice , as soon as wa \u0152 we were b \u0152 lucky and come to Vienna, that I have to write her, and they may \u0152 they \u0152 they will make immediately steps that they will come after us to Vienna. But in between this is a other story, her husband changed his mind, he didn\u2122t want [indecipherable] this stay there. And he wa \u0152 he felt sorry til today for visiting last few years them, he felt sorry all the time that he didn\u2122t came after us. Then when we \u0152 so we \u0152 yeah , and then it happened in May the 30 th, 1940 \u0152 1969, actually we left Czechoslovakia . And where we lived in the apar \u0152 I had a car already. In this time I bought a car, it happens \u0152 this is other story, how it was Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 117difficult. It was permission from the company, but we had the car. We had the \u0152 we had the application for a new car two years before, because it take always a committee who decided who will get the car, because it was har \u0152 very had to get the car, a permission to buy a car, if you had the money. And you have \u0152 you had to put down 60 percent of the price of the car in a bank. It was blocked in a bank that you had the money. So I had the car ab out for a year or so. That\u2122s about half [indecipherable] almost a new car. And so we were preparing, we \u0152 so I parked my car in front of the building, it was on a main street. And the day before \u0152 and we had all the permissions and everything . So a day before, to the evening, we started to take some stuff, what we will need for the vacation, and put in the car. Because I had the garage, so we are leave the car over the ma \u0152 overnight in the garage. And because we wanted to leave early in the morning, as soon as possible. So \u0152 and then we \u0152 and I knew from the time when we came back from \u0152 when I came back from America, special then in the months after new year, February, March, we were watching, again by the secret police. And then I was \u0152 when we were taking down all the stuff into the car, and then not far away, maybe 60 or 70 yards, it was a corner, a building, and th ere was a restaurant. And we saw that some guy in rain clothes \u0152 in plain clot hes that\u2122s \u0152 was go \u0152 walking around. And sometime he stopped there, reading a pape r, went inside in the restaurant, and from the restaurant was a window straight to our apart \u0152 to the car where \u0152 where I Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 118was parking. It was about 70 yards. And then again he came out, he ge \u0152 went around the corner, and again get the newspa per, and then to the restaurant. So we knew exactly, because we knew all those kind of things what they are doing because all the secret \u0152 so we knew immediately that someone is watching us. So if I describe you, or if you \u0152 I can\u2122t [indecipherable] it wasn\u2122t so smooth. I will try to be really short. And around mor \u0152 in the morning, around 4:30 or five o\u2122clock, it was May the 30th or the 31st \u0152 the 31st, we left Liberec and went on the way to Hungary. So we stopped during the night in a little town \u0152 you stop? It then \u0152 then it was Bratislava, it was on the border, actually on Czech and Moravia . And then we stopped during the night in a camp, to stay overnight.

And I said that we\u2122re going to Hungary, that we\u2122re going to Yugoslavia, so on. And he said, you know what? Drove \u0152 drive your car behind the building. So I knew immediately it\u2122s not goo \u0152 good. So I drove the car behind the building. There was a \u0152 the long table, and he said okay, but we would like to see what you have in your car. Take out everything from your car. So we took out everything on th e car, or took \u0152 or put on the table. And we had our tent, we had [indecipherable], we had a stove, everything like we go for vacation to \u0152 for camping. And what we had in suitcase, everything out. And then he took out \u0152 and that car had the engine in the back, you know it was \u0152 and the \u0152 the \u0152 the trunk was in the front. So, he took the front \u0152 he took out our spare tire. They took \u0152 pull up the battery from the trunk. And it took about an hour, all this checking and everything what they di d. And people down on the road, other people were traveling and they left. Everybody were looking up because they saw from \u0152 from the stree \u0152 from the road that we are standing, and customs are standing there, and with all the stuff there. And can you imagine that where the glove department is, there was \u0152 I found out that was a little, like space. And it come to my mind what I had at home with my prayer book. So \u0152 and I found out \u0152 so there I hide some papers, what \u0152 he r birth certificate, some other papers. Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 121[indecipherable] had a few krones (ph), some money and other documents what we had, what we knew if they will find it, it\u2122s finished. They were let \u0152 they knew that something is wrong, that we taking some money with us [indecipherable] because they checked our \u0152 our purses, our \u0152 our \u0152 my \u0152 my wife\u2122s purse and everything. So if they would find these kind of papers, what we \u0152 why I need papers, my documents, what I went to sc hool, or when my wife \u0152 wife does \u0152 so there I was hidden, but it was so narrow, that later on when I had to take it out, I scratched my hand, because it was very hard to take out. And they opened the glove department, they looked behind, but didn\u2122t realize, because it was something like hidden, so they didn\u2122t see that this is \u0152 this is actually a \u0152 a secret space there. This was \u0152 they were lucky. So after about an hour they didn\u2122t find \u0152 they didn\u2122t find the space there. After about an hour or so, and even \u0152 you know I said it\u2122s \u0152 I \u0152 I have to \u0152 to mention, my wife used to make iyer(ph) cognac, natur \u0152 because she liked it, so here and there she tried to st \u0152 you know what\u2122s iyer(ph) cognac is now? This is a \u0152 a liqueur, this is made from eggs \u0152 eggs and liqueur, you know, and it\u2122s very \u0152 so sweet, you can hardly ge t drunk or so. And the oth \u0152 on the way, she usually lit \u0152 taked a \u0152 from the \u0152 from the bottle, a taste, and til we came there to the customs, she was a \u0152 a little so in good mood, you know. And suddenly when it was all over with the checking [indecipherable] everything was outside, and suddenly she stepped like this and she said, gentlemen, could you tell me Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 122please, what are you looking for? Maybe I ca n help you. And I said, be quiet. We don\u2122t be th \u0152 nasty to gen \u0152 because I saw that they \u0152 they were a little so \u0152 not so \u0152 so straight, like they were before when the \u0152 they were so strict, they were talking to us like we were some robberies or something, or criminals. And then in to the end, after an hour, both of them were so \u0152 a little softer. And I told her [indecipherable] quiet, don\u2122t \u0152 and okay, so \u0152 and she says so, can I put back the \u0152 yeah, you can. So okay, so [indecipherable] and so she started slowly with here, and I said, take everything through it in. If they would let us go, we will be \u0152 as soon as we can be away from it better. Okay, then I help her, we started to threw it only in the car and everything. And then they told us, come \u0152 come with the car in the front of the building, stop there. Beca use they had all the papers, everything. So, I stopped there and so they let you go , but then he stopped, and I said okay. They gave the papers, and I said, you know when \u0152 and when you went from Czechoslovakia , you had to fill out a piece of paper, what you are taking out. And then you had to show on the border when you come back, if you brought it \u0152 everything back and what you brought back. And I said, but yo \u0152 I have the passport and the papers, I don\u2122t have the pa per what it says when I come back and show the \u0152 the \u0152 for the customs what I took out and wh at took back. And he says, I gave it to you. And I said, but I don\u2122t ha ve here. Yeah, and th \u0152 and then my wife says, oh, maybe yeah, I think I have here between the pape rs, I have it. So \u0152 and I Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 123said, because we have to \u0152 and I told them even, I \u0152 we have to be back because my wife has some examinations, she went to \u0152 to a college school and took courses, she took \u0152 and I said, three days later she had the examinations, so we have to bring back, and I don\u2122t want to have some troubles when I come back. I gave it to your wife. Again. Well, she says, maybe I as \u0152 my wife said, maybe I have here. So we went, we came, yeah, and we stayed there on our seaside \u0152 not seaside, it was a big lake where we have friends who usually we stayed o \u0152 for vacations every year. So we thought we will stay there for a week or 10 days with them. So we stopped there, and we say we are going to Yugoslavia and we will stay for a few days. Who said \u0152 and the la \u0152 the \u0152 our friend says oh, that\u2122s good, good, good, we\u2122ll stay \u0152 and then during the night I couldn\u2122t sleep, it was from Saturday to Sunday, I remember like today. And I said, you know what \u0152 I told my wife, I think so \u0152 I would stay not one more day, because if they made those search on the border, they immediately sent a cable to Liberec that we went to the gi \u0152 border, they let us. And if we will stay in Hungary, this is still a communist country, they can make immediately there\u2122s a stop in Hungary , and they send us back. And I said, today is Sunday, they \u0152 the office is in Liberec closed. So better if as soon as we\u2122ll go away \u0152 okay, my wife didn\u2122t want to, so [indecipherable] says, that\u2122s okay, we go. So I turned to my friend, listen, you know we wanted better we will stop more days in Yugoslavia, and then we will come back sooner, Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 124we will stay with you when we come back, because it doesn\u2122t say that \u0152 we want so \u0152 at least two or three days or so, and I says no, we better because they said it\u2122s a nice weather there in yugo \u0152 okay, so we went. We came to the border on Hungary and Yugoslavia. They stopped us, they told us the Hungarian customs, wait in the car. So we wait in the car. We wait five minute, 10 minutes, 15 minutes long, nobody came out. So then I said oh, this is not good. And I said because maybe from Bratislava they sent a message to the Hungarian border to stop us and to check us. So it took about 20 minutes. Other people were coming down, other customs let them go, only to [indecipherable] and us they st \u0152 we were sitting in the car from 20 minutes. And then suddenly they came out, they pull up the hood, they pull up the hood for the engine, they pull up the hood from the trunk. And there were \u0152 in front of us was a boss, you know people were standing, came around, people standing around, you know, they were nose \u0152 no \u0152 no \u0152 mousey \u0152 nosey to see what\u2122s going on. So it took about five, 10 minute here. He took everything back up, something he took out, then put back, you know the Hungarian customs. Then said \u0152 take th e steps. Okay, you can go. We can \u0152 and immediately was the border, it was only a small river, a bridge. We came \u0152 immediately was the Yugoslavian customs. Came to Yugoslavian customs, I show them the paper, open the window. Immediately, okay, you taking, what you are going, for how long, I said oh, he gave the stamp. We left . Well, we came to Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 125Yugoslavia , so we went to the seaside, about \u0152 and we thought that we will stay there til we will go to Austria, we will stay about for a few days, a little, to relax."

And I said, now even President Hus\u00e1k can lick my behind. So \u0152 because now we are finally in a free country, and we are free. Can you \u0152 and I started to cry, you know, I started to cry. So that \u0152 that was a so \u0152 then, we came to Vienna, it was sometime late in the evening, and it \u0152 the next day it was a holiday in \u0152 in the Austria. So we stayed in a camp. The next day we went immediately in the morning to HIAS, and I registered, and then was \u0152 I spoke German. And then was on HIAS in the office a woman, make a registration, and so on. And I had my papers, I took out my birth certificate and so on. And he was still proof if I am really Jewish. And he said \u0152 he asked me the question, so if you are Jewish, where is the \u0152 what is the highest holiday in our religion? I said, Yom Kippur. And I said, you know what? When I got up in th e morning, you know what was my first word \u0152 word? [speaks Hebrew here]. You know what it mean s, that translation? Thank you God \u0152 God upstairs hermelek(ph), the king of all the holy works, and so on. And I said, do you believe me? I \u0152 I didn\u2122t talk about the pull down the Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 127pants. Yeah, so \u0152 and the women \u0152 we we re laughing. She says, yeah, yeah. And she says, don\u2122t be mad, because we had, after the Russian came in, we had many people, Christian who came here and they said that they are Jews, because they knew that the Jewish organizations take more care of them than the Christians in their o-organizations, you know, the Cath olics and all these organizations. Say, Christians came and they had \u0152 and the woman told me, we had many occasions that Christians came to us, and we had to send them, give them the address we had, the Catholic organizations. So \u0152 and we stayed there, but now you could see in Vienna, people who were escaping from Czechoslovakia . Left cars on the street, left cars on the airport, because they couldn\u2122t sell. Everybody was glad to get rid, because they \u0152 as soon as they get permission go to Canada , to Australia , to Sweden, to America immediately. They di \u0152 they left everything there. And I had almost a new car, so \u0152 and I told this guy who asked me about the high holidays, you know, I said, do you know what? I have almost a new car, and I would like to get some money, because we don\u2122t have mone y, we don\u2122t have currency, nothing. If someone would give me some few shillings, some few hundreds, or some dollars or so. He says , you know what? I have a friend, he has a dealership, maybe he will buy because he\u2122s a Czechoslovak guy and sells Czechoslovak cars, wa \u0152 running, because Czechoslovakia was exporting some cars to Austria. So I went there, yeah, we stayed there in \u0152 in the \u0152 yeah, and they Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 128ga-gave us a address where we can go to stay a few nights til we\u2122re \u0152 that transport, because they started to, in this time were people, many people came from Hungary, from Czechoslovakia , from Poland, many people. So they made always a transport train \u0152 car, went straight to Rome , because in Rome, the HIAS was the main concentration, the main office. So after a \u0152 the second or third day he told me, you know what? Go show \u0152 there he gave me the address. Show the car, he probably will buy from you. So I went there, he liked the car, so he \u0152 he bought the car. So at least I didn\u2122t have to leave the car. He gave me, I don\u2122t know how many hundred dollars. So at least we had [indecipherable] some money. And I left the car with everything there, so I said, at least something. And then, usually after three or four days they make \u0152 they had the \u0152 had th-the 30 or 40 people, some a \u0152 sometimes even 70 people, so they made two rail cars, and send to Vienna. And \u0152 yo, and everybody has to go immediately, HIAS sent you to a doctor, he was a Jewish doctor, originally from Poland, but he lived in Austria for many years already, like for a check-up if you are capable, if you are able to go to take the [indecipherable] to go, or [indecipherable] to go to Rome. And we went there, and I started to tell him a little bit the story, what I went through, the few days. And I said, you know doctor, I\u2122ve ba \u0152 ba \u0152 ap \u0152 appealed to you. We \u0152 my wife is not so healthy and I \u0152 you know, always this nervous break, what was. If you can give her some medication and to check her up more and after three or Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 129four days, if something really was happe ned, because she has kidney problems \u0152 problems, and it was true. And he told he \u0152 he started to talk to my Yiddish. And he says, in Yiddish, you know, tell me the truth, Vienna is a nice city. Probably you want to stay to see the city. And I telled him, you know what, it\u2122s one of the reasons too. A-And he said, you know what? I give you, you will stay two weeks in Vienna. Stay, but you know, and I thought to my wife \u0152 to myself, better to tell the truth straight and what happens, happe n. And he \u0152 then he told me, you know, I like you because you told me that you liked to stay in Vienna. So then we \u0152 we stayed in Vienna for two weeks, so we looked a little, and at least it helped us, special me, get a little \u0152 a normal feeling, a normal life, because no \u0152 otherwise, I was on the bottom, really. I was completely eshi \u0152 exhausted \u0152 exhausted. So then we stayed there, and then we, after two weeks they send us to \u0152 to Rome . There we registered in the HIAS, and immediately \u0152 it was ve ry good organized there, and immediately they gave us \u0152 because in Rome there were all over signs that say, lease apartments, special for refugees becal \u0152 twas meant \u0152 so, we took out an apartment. And the hia \u0152 HIAS, actually Joint, gave the money that what we paid for the rent, and they gave some pocket money that you can buy some food or something, minimum, but it was enough. And after three months or so, because when I went in Czechoslovakia gymnasium, I learned Latin, we had the subject Latin. So after three months I started to speak Italian. So then was the \u0152 the \u0152 the Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 130president in HIAS was a Romanian woman who spoke \u0152 spoke Hungarian. And then as \u0152 she saw that I spoke Italian, I spoke Hungarian, and I spoke Polish, and I spoke Russian, I spoke Czech. So \u0152 and the other woman my \u0152 my \u0152 who was in charge, my caseworker, she was a Romanian too, and she spoke \u0152 spoke Hungarian too. So said one thing to other, and I talked to them, so they hired me that I was a interpreter in HIAS for all those people, because many people came, special from Poland, from Hungary, from Romania. So I was working one year approximately on HIAS like a interpreter. So, me, my wife actually stayed in Rome 15 months. And between this time it helped a lot, because we received money like refugees, like everybody else. And beside that, Joint paid me like a employee on HIAS. So we started to travel a little bit in Italy, and I spoke Italian. So actually in \u0152 was in \u0152 my job was there. At least once a week, sometimes twice a week, I went to the railroad station in Rome every \u0152 in the morning, around eight o\u2122clock in the morning. And always came one railroad car, or two cars, it depends how many people came. And in ad \u0152 in advance, I had all the names who is coming, how many people. And I have to tell you, I \u0152 some Italian police were accompanying each car from the border to Rome , that nobody can come in in those car. No Italian police to check if regular or not. And when they came to Rome to me at those stations, they knew me already, all those people. I [inaudible] have to tell you, I gave them m oney, because I had \u0152 I \u0152 I had the Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 131envelope from the Joint, from \u0152 I gave the two guys envelope and I told them \u0152 they told me, buongiorno Mikula , buongiorno. A come sta , how you feel and so on. I said, buongiorno signore , I gave them the envelope, arrivederci . And that\u2122s was I took over all the people I took them to HIAS for registration. There they get all \u0152 they received all the instruction farther, and then I was working [indecipherable] people to give adva \u0152 adva \u0152 advi ce, to help them what I have to do. And then I took all the pa \u0152 what someone had introduce on different consulates, you know for the visas or so on . So I went with them to interpret on the \u0152 on the consulate because I spoke Italian there. And then I took all the passports, and all papers, translation, everyt hing, to all those consulates for what \u0152 for \u0152 for verification, because usually they get permission, the Italian government gave permission for refugees for three months. Who stayed longer, I had to go to the police, I had to go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get permission. So that\u2122s what I did for HIAS , what I went then \u0152 and then all the transport, what all they sent for example, many people to Canada or to us, or I accompanied these people to the airport. And sometimes pe ople came illegally to \u0152 they send them from Belgrade or from Bucharest . So I went to the airport, I took over those people and took to the \u0152 not to the e-exit with other people, but to the \u0152 to the Italian police, you know, to the comma ndant of the airport. And he knew everything, so he gave the permission, and then when I took them to HIAS, you Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 132know, because those people didn\u2122t have visas. So that\u2122s what I \u0152 I did. I did a lot of this kind of things what help ed people actually to come to Italy and then to help them to \u0152 to make translation, that \u0152 like a [indecipherable] a translator to them, even privately with the \u0152 with the \u0152 when they were looking for apartments, and so on. So I was busy enough, but during the weekend I could go out, so I can relax a little bit, so that\u2122s \u0152 we stayed there."

Even they gave it to someone or someone \u0152 someone bought it. So an \u0152 for example, it was \u0152 and they took here and we \u0152 we were \u0152 afte r awhile when they saw that they \u0152 we didn\u2122t came back, they sentenced us, me and my wife to two years in prison in ab \u0152 in absentia, because we left illegally. So that means if we would go back during those period, there it was the communist, first we will go in jail, maybe they will Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 133for two years, maybe th \u0152 ev en more. So when they started to liquidate \u0152 before they started liquidate all our furnitures, and everything, so my wife\u2122s mother went to the police. She wanted to get at least the couch what we had. She had to buy it, and it took her a lot of work. She get, a nd she had to pay the police to get the couch what belongs to her daughter. So she has \u0152 I told her \u0152 later she had enough guts even to go to the police, first of all. So then the first \u0152 the first \u0152 1946 - \u212247, I used to go to a shul in Liberec. It was a small minyan, few Jews. But then when, special from 1948, it was very dangerous to show that you are religious, or you are keeping the \u0152 the \u0152 your fa ith, special Jewish faith. Even Christians, Christians were, under communism, were afraid to go to a church. They didn\u2122t go, even they were religious. So then \u0152 and when I came back, in 1991, after 22 years, to Czechoslovakia , and I went to Liberec \u0152 so the first thing Friday evening I went \u0152 because I have a friend of mine, a Jewish guy who lived there, and I ask him, do you still have prayer, do you have some Jews here a nd so on. He says, hardly we make a minyan on Friday ev ening. So I said, I-I came there, and I came there Friday evening and made the minyan til we were about 10 or 11 people with \u0152 including me. And later \u0152 so then \u0152 oh, an d this time was more, the later and later years, in 1933 - \u212234, it was hardly a mi nyan. So and some people told me, you know, I remember when I had about, in 1946 \u0152 \u212247 a ol d guy, so I remember you used to come, and so on. And then later on they had very few re \u0152 Jews. And then Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 134they came, for example, for the high holidays, they ca me Jews from cities or from villages who were about 10 - 20 miles away from Michalovce, so they came for the high holidays [indecipherable] little like one room what they have there.

And then later years I gave him I \u0152 a sum of money, I spent them some \u0152 left them some dolla rs to help him. And they were very grateful always. And now finally they \u2122re \u0152 after \u0152 after 1990, when it was [break] In 1991, there in Liberec [indecipherable] the whole house, so there was some apartments. Upstairs they were renting it. Downstairs, they had two rooms with everything, with Torahs and everything, with some curtains. And now, after about two or three years ago, they decided, and there in Liberec, where the German 1938 on Kristallnacht, they destroyed a beautiful, beautiful, nice, big synagogue, they \u0152 the Czechoslovak government and the Jewish organizations from Prague gave some money, and they are starting, I th ink, last year to build so-called library. But the main part of the library will be a Jewish synagogue with everything like a Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 135normal synagogue. Two years ago I say \u0152 I-I \u0152 they showed me the whole plan, even they have in \u0152 on tapes, pictures how the building will \u0152 will look, and it will be a bi \u0152 because now it is there a parking lot. So on the same place where the \u0152 a st \u0152 beautiful, in the center of the city, next to the big theater, and t-to city hall, actually, behind the corner, there will be built a new \u0152 a li \u0152 a new, big library, but the main part will be a beautiful, nice synagogue. So I am looking forward next \u0152 no, this year in \u0152 in September, I am going there, so \u0152 to Liberec so \u0152 because I will be in Prague and I will be staying in a spa.

So I will go there, I will talk to my friend, and I\u2122ll look how far, what this \u0152 because last year I couldn\u2122t go there, I \u0152 even I was in the Czech Republic , but wait, I was there? Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, but it wasn\u2122t started yet, so I hope that started. And even he called me last year, and they received a van, because they have like a small community there now, about 15 people, about eight or nine families who live there. And they received a van, a used van from Germany, but they didn\u2122t have papers . So one day he wro-wro \u0152 I\u2122m sorry \u0152 he wrote me a letter that if a \u0152 if I can ge \u0152 get someone papers from here, from General Motors, because it was a General Motors van, because otherwise the police in Liberec, they couldn\u2122t get Czechoslovak papers for the vavan because it was a present and they don\u2122 t have the papers.
