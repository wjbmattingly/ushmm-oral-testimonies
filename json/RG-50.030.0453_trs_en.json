And it\u2019s very interesting that I escaped from Czechoslovakia act \u2014 in 1968 and \u201969, after the Russian came in, I went from \u2014 I escaped illegally, with two suitcases. I left every [indecipherable] everything there for the government. Then [indecipherable] were sentenced in absentia to two years in prison because we left illegally \u2014 legally they didn\u2019t let you. So we left like for vacation. It was very hard to get, because we went from Czechoslovakia to Hungary, from Hungary to \u2014 to Yugoslavia. From Yugoslavia to Austria. In Vienna we registered in the HIAS in the Jewish immigration office. There we stayed about for two weeks, and they send us to Rome, to Italy, where 1s the main concentration of refugees, especially of Jewish refugees on the HIAS. And by the way, I was there working in Rome, we stayed in Rome 15 months approximately, because I was working on hire \u2014 they Interview with Mikulas Judikovic \" April 7, 1997 hired me, after three months I started to speak Italian, because I had learned it in gymnasium when I went, so I learned very easy. So I was working one year in HIAS in Rome, like an interpreter. So I stayed 15 months, you know \u2014 and by the way, I used to go the first time, after 22 years to go to a shul, to a synagogue, because in Czechoslovakia, first of all, we to \u2014 under communism it was very dangerous to show that you are religious, or you going \u2014 secondly, there was no Jews, so I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to go. So I went to a little shul there in Rome, and suddenly I took a prayer book and I found in the prayer book a card what was a ticket, a steady ticket, a year\u2019s ticket for my father for the streetcars in Prague. Can you imagine? And I had here the card, not long time ago, and I am very sorry, I cannot find. I was looking, and I don\u2019t remember if I gave it to the Holocaust museum here in Detroit, or I put somewhere. And I had the card for many years, and I\u2019m sorry, otherwise I would give the card to you, to show that 1t was \u2014 and when I was in Rome, and they called me the first time to the \u2014 I had \u2014 had the aliyah, to show \u2014 to called me to the Torah. And I was very fluent, I remember, because I wa \u2014 go back to how it was in Czechoslovakia and was praying. So I said the first brocha by the aliyah very fluently. And suddenly, when I had to continue, suddenly I stopped and I couldn\u2019t get a word from my mouth. And they thought, the people who are standing next to me, they thought that, what\u2019s happened? What\u2019s Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Mikulas Judikovic \" April 7, 1997 hap \u2014 and it took me about two minutes to ga \u2014 get \u2014 continue because I was \u2014 I was so excited, and for me was \u2014 is so something that I cannot imagine, I couldn\u2019t imagine that after so many years I\u2019m standing in front of the Torah by a-aliyah. So then I told them, so they told me they can understand that. So that what it happened to me in Rome. And I wanted only to say that in Czechoslovakia, because it was very dangerous to have some prayers or to go to a shul. So I had the prayer book, and my father gave me the idea \u2014 we had the drawer in our dresser. And behind the back of the drawer, in the wall, in the back of the dresser was a little space. So I put the prayer book in back of the drawer, and besi \u2014 behind the drawer, I put a plywood, so when you opened the drawer, you couldn\u2019t see nothing in the back. And from the back I made a little hole, a small hole that you can push down the \u2014 the plywood with a wire. So it was a small \u2014 and when I opened the drawer and I pushed the \u2014 with th-the wire the plywood, so the plywood came down and I took my prayer book. So at least on the high holidays, approximate, I knew where they are, so I was praying, because otherwise what \u2014 when my sister escaped from Czechoslovakia with her husband in 1948, and then my other sister with her husband in 1950, illegally, and I gave some money out, I helped them. So then it was very dangerous because the police came after me. I was in \u2014 even in custody for \u2014 for a few days, and they even slapped me because I didn\u2019t want to tell them h- Interview with Mikulas Judikovic : April 7, 1997 ho \u2014 which way my sister escaped and left Czechoslovakia. So, then I \u2014 so I knew that was genderus \u2014 dangerous to pray, so that\u2019s way \u2014 and I knew that exactly, at least twice during the time in those year, in 1950 - \u201951, maybe \u201952, the secret police came during the day when we were in [indecipherable] my wife at work, they were checking my a \u2014 our apartment for certain things they will find, because \u2014 especially my wife, she realized \u2014 she opened, for example there, her underwear was, that it was put a different way back, or our other things what we had in our drawers, or in the \u2014 1n our \u2014 1n our closet. So that\u2019s \u2014 we knew exactly they were secretly \u2014 they came to our apartment to check, and to make \u2014 if they will find something against me. Maybe they were more times than twice, but twice we knew exactly for sure. So when I \u2014 they took me many times, about three times I wa \u2014 I think, to the secret police, and they were even telling me, if I won\u2019t tell how the \u2014 my sister went, and what connections I have with my sisters overseas in the west, that they will send me to Jachymov. This was very a dangerous [indecipherable] it was uran-uranium \u2014 uranium m-mine, that they were sending the worst criminals or politically who are dangerous for them. And most of the people even died then in those mines, or if they after many years they were lucky, came back, their whole \u2014 their life \u2014 they were sick with \u2014 from the uran \u2014 from \u2014"

So \u2014 and 1n this time, something happened with my \u2014 I had my shoe when was walking so much, and my Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Mikulas Judikovic * April 7, 1997 heel, I had some damage [indecipherable] my heel, you know, some blood and so on, and it suddenly get the red. So I-I get some infection. And my father, when he heard that I back in jail, he had somebo \u2014 because close to our house was the hospital, and he had \u2014 had a doctor who he was very close. So I\u2014 he gave me some money, and the next morning, because it was a holiday, he came to the jail and told this guy, listen, I heard here you have a \u2014 someone who had some infection. I have to check him. So, he gave immediately, because my father gave some money to the doctor, he gave a little money to this guy, he let him in. He get \u2014 take a look at me, and he really saw \u2014 I can you show me, even today I have a scar, and he showed \u2014 took a [indecipherable] and he showed the guards and said, look, this is red and swollen, I have to take him immediately to the hospital to take \u2014 to open it. And you can tell the g \u2014 the \u2014 the Hlinka guard or someone that I took him out and they can see him in the hospital. So he took me to the hospital, immediately he opened it. He made a big \u2014 a big bandage on it. I don\u2019t even remember if he freeze it or not, but probably, because I felt some pain immediately. And he put me in a room, and immediately aft \u2014 in the afternoon, there came two guardists(ph), one [indecipherable] police, and what immediately called the doctor, the doctor went with he \u2014 with them to the room, and they told him \u2014 he told them, look, I cannot leave him, he has temperature \u2014 and I really had temperature, because it was really Interview with Mikulas Judikovic \u201c April 7, 1997 an infection [indecipherable]. And I cannot even open the wound. I have here the papers of what I wrote down, what I did to him. And you have to wait til take, two or three days til he can get out, or I will see what\u2019s happen, because it\u2019s so dangerous that he can die even, a so dangerous infection. So it took I don\u2019t know how long because they were arguing with him there in the office. So they let me down. And every five or six hours came a guardist, or a policeman to check if I am there. And can you imagine? I swear to you that it\u2019s true what I am telling you. The next morning, when it was right after the holiday, early in the morning, all the 29 people too \u2014 they took away \u2014 that went to concentration camp. And after the war, I met only one of them. He was originally from Lithuania, but he lived in Slovakia after t\u2014 about two years, about three years. And he told me, as far as he knew, immediately in 1942 \u2014 for \u2014 for \u2014 1943, 22 people, they\u2019re shot or died in Auschwitz. And he survived, and ya \u2014 as sla \u2014 as far as he knows, he said, I don\u2019t know if someone else survived. So then I stayed in the hospital about 10 days, and then they let me go because the \u2014 the older people left already. So \u2014 but they had my name, so that\u2019s where I went war \u2014 in hiding and so on. And I was suspicious because they had my name that I tried to go to Hungary.

And he let [indecipherable] this guy, he didn\u2019t know for \u2014 what he is calling for. And he came in this \u2014 yeah, first of all, he ca \u2014 he asked me, the German captain 1f I understand German. And I said no.

And I said, yes, we had German, but it was many years ago, but usually we didn\u2019t \u2014 there were very few conversations, so now I forgot.

So he was the translator, so I had always a little \u2014 and I spoke fluently German. So he always \u2014 the captain ask the soldier to ask me certain question. So I \u2014 I had always a few seconds or a minute maybe, time to think about the answer. So, before the questions, he questioned me about for 15 minutes or 20 minutes or so. And he asked me what I am doing, so I said this guy \u2014 this guy \u2014 I am buying all on those hills fruit, and we make muSst and all the say \u2014 cider for the army. You know, he glad to call this guy, he came in this room. When he saw me he almost collapsed, because he knew actually who I am, he knew that I am with partisans.

Immediately they let him go, and he let go the notary from the city to check my papers if they are not false. And the notary, he is to \u2014 still, because this is the \u2014 where the partisans were, and I was staying, mostly was 85 or 90 percent not Catholic. They were Evangelics, Protestants. The notary came and the \u2014 and the commandant, the captain showed him the paper, are these really papers, are not false? And the notary said no, they are correct, they are hundred percent real.

They [indecipherable] soldier, they [indecipherable] me to the guard there, and let me go.

No, I mean, I\u2019m sorry, in the afternoon about five o\u2019clock, I made the \u2014 because I thought that six a \u2014 after six o\u2019clock I cannot be there. So he says, I still \u2014 I have to take you to the kommandatura, but in this time there\u2019s other arm \u2014 other \u2014 I don\u2019t know, hi-higher than a captain, I don\u2019t know what it was. It was the army who actually were moving back because the front was coming, it was very close. You could hear the shooting and everything. So he took me there and he showed \u2014 and I thought \u2014 I told him that I didn\u2019t know that I\u2019m with all \u2014 because I lived there and there, outside, and I wanted to visit, I wanted to buy some food still, because there was no food, because there wasn\u2019t stores, because there were places what you have no stores, nothing, five six houses, nothing else. So \u2014 and in \u2014 by the way, both cases, I was lucky that not the one, not the first one didn\u2019t tell me to pull the pants down. I wa \u2014 I-I don\u2019t know, it was a miracle."

So we heard that are concentration camp, but was in later, in 1944 or something like that. And by the way, this like, is not hear because I \u2014I don\u2019t know if you want to put on tape. About four years ago, my wife said \u2014 alee \u2014 that we are reading the \u2014 we are receiving a Czech newspaper, it comes from New York, what are news from Czechoslovakia and so on. And one day we saw a article there that some Jews who are even outside Czechoslovakia and who can prove that they were in concentration camp, or in the army with th-the Russians always there, England. They can get some compensation, because the Germans sent some money to the Czech re \u2014 Czechoslovakia, and it will be like some compensation because they were in concentration camp. So my wife said, look, maybe \u2014 and she was \u2014 she was very fluent in Czech corresponding as a \u2014 because she was a clerk in Czechoslovakia \u2014 and by the way, we have a Czech typewriter. I Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Mikulas Judikovic \u201c April 7, 1997 don\u2019t know how it happened, but we bought away from a \u2014 during a friend or so on, we had the Czech writer, because the alphabet in Czech 1s a little different. So she says, you know what? I will try to write application for some people. Maybe they will get. And I do \u2014I thou \u2014 I mentioned to my brother-in-law, and he said to a friend of ours. So we wrote application, and really was happen, and we had t-to write the first application to the Ministry of Defense. They will prove \u2014 they could prove if you have \u2014 that you were like persecuted in a labor camp. And then they give a paper, so-called law number 255. This 1s a law, a Czechoslovak law what recognized that you were persecuted, and you were eligible in certain advantages. For example, like I have the 255, I \u2014 and I get because I worked in Czechoslovakia more than 25 years, I have pension, because I am eligible on normal pension. And I\u2019m better, if I get the normal pension, that I will get compensation through the Germans. So we wrote them, and I received the 255, and then we made the application for the Czechoslovak Social Security, because they give the money. And th-that proved tha-that he was persecuted and were receiving the money. And in the pens \u2014 you have to have a affidavit from a doctor that he has certain illnesses, and he has \u2014 he has invalidity, 10 percent, 50 percent, 100 \u2014 and he gets certain amount of money. And we have about five people already. And some get 35 dollars a month, some get 60 dollars a month. And in one occasion he get 110 dollars a Interview with Mikulas Judikovic \u201c April 7, 1997 month, and were received through backwards for half a year, or year, or th-th \u2014 thousand dollars, or 1200 dollars, besides what \u2014 and they receiving every month, even today. So \u2014 and I needed addresses for certain concentration camp, because you have to prove that th-they were in concentration camp. So I went here, to the Holocaust Museum, and get out maybe 30 or 26 addresses, even from small concentration camps. And what the people told us, there were this concentration camp, this cencontra \u2014 well, from the [indecipherable] from the concentration camp, they were sent to work in a factory. The factory actually received people to work from the sod \u2014 concentration camp. It was for a hundred people, 150 people. So I went there into the da \u2014 and suddenly, when these people received the money, he said \u2014 the one friend told to the other friend you wouldn\u2019t believe, we are almost 50 people, what we made applications from \u2014 beside that, two years ago came new laws in Czechoslovakia, so it\u2019s more complicated. You need more proof, more papers. So I went to the library in the Holocaust Museum, I took all the addresses, because we had to write to all those concentration camp. We write in Polish, we write in English, we write in German. And to the international cross in Arles, and in all over. And all the peoples are coming, so there are proof there were some da \u2014 and Ill have to translate from English to Czech, from German to Czech, from Polish to Czech, from Russian to Czech and I am doing all these things, and I have Interview with Mikulas Judikovic \u00b0\u00b0 April 7, 1997 \u2014 I\u2019m translating. I am going to notarize my signature that I translated. So you cannot imagine what a work, what we would \u2014 1f you \u2014 1f you would know that it takes so long, we wouldn\u2019t do it. And you know what, we don\u2019t take money from those people, and we are doing this free. Some people when they receive the paper gave us, I don\u2019t know, they gave us 20 dollars or so, or nothing, we don\u2019t ask the money, because they see how much work it has. So what I wanted to say, I went to the con \u2014 to the labor \u2014 to the Holocaust Museum. Suddenly I saw a thick two books. And I saw people \u2014 can you stop for a moment? I bring you to show you something. [break] It runs?"

So they saw a woman with children, they immediately sent to the oven. So, it was \u2014 and then women realized, even it was heartbreaking, so they let the children, separate the children, and they survived, because they didn\u2019t go with the children, otherwise they would go to the chimney \u2014 to the oven, too. So the children \u2014 anyhow, very few survived. And my sister [indecipherable] was here. She went from Hungary to concentration camp and she was lucky, because she went with some cousins. And she was, in this time she was 14 and a half years old. And so the women were \u2014 they were \u2014 the SS came many times to look for children, so they were hiding her in concentration camp. And they were \u2014 they were so malnutritious they don\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t have any food, so other women brought pieces of bread only to get here to give her, or I don\u2019t know, if they found something, a little milk or something.

So the other people were \u2014 even when they know that they\u2019re going \u2014 looking for children Interview with Mikulas Judikovic \" April 7, 1997 or for something.

They buried them there, or they took them to the cemetery. Anyhow, so I don\u2019t know here \u2014 where he was buried. Can you imagine? Life you know, the \u2014 the li \u2014 the human life is so unpredictable. And in 1946, I met his sister, she survived the Holocaust. She was a year younger than he was.

So then I saw a \u2014 after few weeks, my one sister came back, Haide(ph), some times in June, I think. And then I heard someone came from Budapest, that my younger sister is alive. So we were waiting for it, you know, after few days or few weeks, the other sister, who lives here in Detroit, Tullulah(ph), came back, so we met together in Michalovece, but Interview with Mikulas Judikovic \"t April 14, 1997 we didn\u2019t know what to do. And then we had \u2014 if I can continue now after the war, we had the aunt in Vranov, this was about 35 miles from Michalovce, she was a first cousin of my father. So she heard \u2014 they were looking and someone \u2014 I don\u2019t remember how \u2014 if she heard about us, or we heard about her. Actually, we went there to Vranov, to her, with her. We stayed there from \u2014 for awhile, and she says that we can stay there, we will look if someone from the family will come back or not. So then I had a friend in Michalovce who was me \u2014 who was we \u2014 with me together in labor camp. And he told me that he has a uncle in Liberec. This is about 65 miles north of Prague. And he has a wholesale store here they gave him back, the Czechoslovak government, because he had this wholesale store before the war, in hardware store and plumbing supply. So \u2014 and this was my profession what I was working during the war. So he somehow connected with him, and he told me he was looking for someone who is responsible, and who is \u2014 who can trust for \u2014 and who can trust, may \u2014 and I can get the job there. So I went there and introduced myself, and he hired me. So it was in January \u2014 exactly in January 1946. And between the \u2014 this time what we in \u2014 in Vranov, in Michalovce, we went to Prague end of the year to look for someone if we were \u2014 some on the Jewish organizations, if they will give some on the Red Cross, if they will give some \u2014 some 1-information about our family members, but we didn\u2019t get anything. So my sister went back to Vranov. They were there for a few months, and I stayed Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 the Liberec already, I started to work there. And then \u2014 but I [indecipherable] and then in \u2014 in Prague, I met some cousins from Slovakia, from Orlich(ph), who were in Prague, stayed in Prague, and one of them was \u2014 one brother of this cousins, he was in the Czechoslovak army in Russia, and he came to Prague, was sometimes in middle s-summer, sometimes in August or September. So \u2014 and because he was ma \u2014 a soldier in the Czechoslovak army in Russia, he was fighting through the front and everything. So they had advantages that they gave those people who was in the concentration camp, or who was fighting against the German, like partisans or \u2014 or in the military, that he can get certain stores or factories, what it \u2014 after there was took over from the Germans. So this two cousins actually were received, they get a store in Jablonice(ph). This was about eight miles from Liberec. It was a store what \u2014 with china, you know, with glass, china, so [indecipherable]. So then my sisters came over to Jablonice(ph), sa \u2014 first they stayed with me in Liberec for many, many months, maybe a year or so. And I \u2014 in ma \u2014 my sister, yeah, she stayed in Liberec the whole time. And then my younger sister started to date, actually it was the brother of my cousin. And they get married in 1948, and my sis \u2014 other sister, she started to date her next husband, a Mr. Joe Dushinski(ph). So she get married, and they stayed in Liberec til end of 1950 or the 1950s, when they escaped from Czechoslovakia and went to Germany, from Germany to Canada and from Canada to the United States. My Interview with Mikulas Judikovic \u201d April 14, 1997 younger sister Lola, when she got married in 1948, end of 1948, yeah. He went \u2014 they went, I think with the Haganah to Germany and to France, to Paris where they stayed there about I think for two years or so, I don\u2019t remember exactly. And then they made corresponding because we had many relatives, first cousin, aunts and uncles here in the United States. So actually, they helped them, that after two years or so they gave them a \u2014 th-they received a visa to Canada. They stayed there for a few months or so, and then they received a visa, they came here to the United States. Between this time, my other sister Haide(ph), with her husband, they escaped [indecipherable] money, I gave some money because he have to like bribe and give money for someone who knew the way to go to the border, to german \u2014 to east Germany. And they went to Berlin, and from ber \u2014 from east Berlin to have \u2014 to have tams \u2014 again for money, they went to west Berlin, and waiting for the papers the same way they received from our relatives the paper, the visa, because they were first cousin and uncles. They went to Canada, they came to Windsor, ma \u2014 first to Halifax, I think. They stayed there from Halifax to Windsor, and then after I don\u2019t know, for I think it was in 1952 or \u00b051 or something like that, they came to the United States, to Detroit, because here in Detroit, we have the \u2014 a cousin here, who was born here in the United States."

Then, after a few weeks, they came to Prague with a big celebration, everything, because it\u2019s again the new Czechoslovak government. But what had happened, the Russians, actually Stalin, even during the war, and it was the fault of the American government of Roosevelt, actually, and Truman, that they would trust \u2014 they trusted to Stalin, and even in 1945 they made the agreement in Tehran, Stalin with Churchill and Roosevelt, that how far the American army, when they will liberate Europe and Germany and other, how far they can go. Because actually Prague, and the mostly part of Czechoslovakia, the American army was actually on the outskirts of Prague, and the Russian didn\u2019t let them farther to go, and the Russians were far away, because they said it was agreement between Russia and the United States. So the American army had to pull back, move west approximately to the city of Posen in Czeska(ph) Budavitsa(ph) and then they stayed. And the people were waiting til the Russian came into Prague, because Stalin wanted political reasons it was, that Czechoslovakia would be influenced later on, ac \u2014 or \u2014 ma \u2014 with the \u2014 the gover \u2014 the \u2014 under a communist government. So actually then it was big celebration that the Russian army liberated Prague and liberated Czechoslovakia, because the true was that the whole Slovakia and Moravia, the Russian army liberated.

I felt immediately, because in this time, in 1949 and 1950 \u2014 1949 already, they took me \u2014 the police came to me and they took me to the police. They were asking me what happened with my younger sister, with Lola. So I told them that in 1948, I \u2014 they disappeared, I don\u2019t know nothing about them. They didn\u2019t believe me. They kept me there about for a day or so. They let me go, but they called me many times. I was about four or five times there on the police, asking questions, a \u2014 who \u2014 ho-how many relatives I have in America, where I have relatives, what I am doing, what I \u2014 my corresponding is, with whom I am corresponding and so on. And then in the 1950, my sister Haide(ph) what \u2014 she left Czechoslovakia, that was a nightmare for me, because then they took me again to the police, and they hold me for a few days, two t \u2014 106 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 three days. Even in that it happened that I get pushed to the wall. Then even a day \u2014a slap my fa\u2014I get a slap on my face that I ha-hold my own hand. I don\u2019t know if I even told my wife some ta \u2014 this. Then they let me \u2014 this wasn\u2019t so easy because I wanted to go. They told me that I knew how my sister, both sister left Czechoslovakia and til I won\u2019t tell them, they will keep me and they will send me to Jachymov. That was a uranium mine, when they put the ra \u2014 uranium from mines, and all the uranium was sending to Russia, because they made that \u2014 probably the atomic bomb or so. And usually people who went \u2014 that was people who were sent to Jachymov to the uranium mines, that was criminals, that was poli \u2014 who were politically \u2014 politically no-not trustworthy, and very few people came back from there. They died. And if after many, many years someone came back, his health was completely \u2014 they get \u2014 they have cancer when they came back, most of them died, and very few survived more years in there, they let her go after fef\u2014 15 or 20 years, or sometimes it happened where they saw someone get very sick and had some connections, so they let him go, but still \u2014 they let him go home, but after many year \u2014 after a few years died because of cancer from the uranium, from the exposures to \u2014 to radiation."

            "answer": "Very much so. And I can tell you, I have to mention maybe that they let me go after a few days or so, 1f \u2014 it was because my wife, she was working in an office, and her president of the office wi \u2014 because it was a \u2014 for the \u2014 the main office for all the restaurants there, it was about 1500 people. He had some connection, the \u2014 her boss had some connection with the police. So my wife probably told him, so he actually, through my \u2014 my wife, through him, heard that the police let me go. But that\u2019s later on, like I mentioned, my wife later on couldn\u2019t keep high position jobs because they knew that her husband has relatives in America, so they didn\u2019t trust her. So then, later on she was only like a clerk, because before she was in a higher position, like a \u2014 in charge of the personnel department, from all the people. Then they \u2014 they \u2014 she couldn\u2019t keep this job, because they didn\u2019t trust her. So actually, they put her in a lower position there. But they needed her because, I have to tell, she was a very good clerk, she was very smart and very capable to do things. And her boss was great, because she did many work what she \u2014 he\u2019s supposed to job \u2014 do. So actually, he didn\u2019t have to work so much, and other people who were in charge. So actually, they used her to work more because the- they knew that she has to if she wants to keep even the lower job. So but \u2014 like I mentioned before, we knew that after years and many times the police were watching us specially. And like I mentioned before, the last time, we knew exactly the \u2014 why they came to our apartment when we were at work and were checking 108 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 well \u2014 if they will find some letters or something, some material what they can use special against me, that I am in connection somehow with my sisters, or with relatives in America."

            "answer": "Re \u2014 re \u2014 they searched our house. Maybe they were mare \u2014 money \u2014 more times, but twice we knew exactly because w-we, like I mentioned, in our closets we recognized, we knew, because w-we knew \u2014 we heard that they are doing this kind of work, the secret police, so we \u2014 exactly on purpose, we put certain things in our closets that we could then recognize that something \u2014 someone was there. And so the \u2014 actually, all those years, we were living with my wife, we couldn\u2019t travel so much like we would like to. And they were watching \u2014 they were watching us, all our steps. Because we were feeling and we saw suspicious people around us, along the \u2014 outside our apartment and so, because they were watching who is coming to our apartment. Maybe they are watching where we are going, with whom we are friends, with whom we are in connection. So that was [indecipherable] that was the reason \u2014 and in 1968, then \u2014 my sister \u2014 I\u2019m a little too far a-ahead, but in 1968 is when my sister\u2019s family \u2014 because here in the family, like I think I mentioned, was a Bar Mitzvah in the family and a wedding in the family, here in Detroit and in Chicago. So, after \u2014 they sent me airline ticket, and I \u2014 invitation that I could come to visit. But they \u2014 I knew in advan \u2014 yeah, 109 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 between the older [indecipherable] once a year and twice a year, my sister \u2014 I received a letter from one sister, from the other sister. But in this time, in Czechoslovakia they had the qui \u2014 equipment, because someone told me later on after years, that they could read the letters who wanted \u2014 who \u2014 special letters who came from the western countries. So actually, before I got the letter, and it was a certain stamp, a letter stamp on the envelope, so actually they, under the secret police, maybe in Prague already, or in Liberec, they actually read all the letters what I received. So they knew what they \u2014 what th-they are writing. And this taught me \u2014 someone later on af \u2014 sometime in the 60s, I think he was in the secret police, I am not sure, but I knew he \u2014 I went to school with him. And he \u2014 one day he was drunk, and I met him, so \u2014 and he started to talk and I was asking him, so I felt between his word what he was talking, that that \u2014 that\u2019s what the police, because he told me actually, they said, look, we knew everything, what\u2019s going on everybody, because we knew in a \u2014 everything what\u2019s going on because we had equipment what we [indecipherable]. So, in 1968 when I came here, it took me a lot of work, because I couldn\u2019t get the visa to America before I get the permission, a paper from the police in Liberec that they let me go for a visit. So \u2014 and it took again th-the boss of my wife, he talked to someone of the police, so that\u2019s where I could get the permission, and I went with the permission to the American embassy in Prague, that\u2019s when I could get the visa. But they never let Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 110 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 go a couple together, special when they didn\u2019t have children, and we didn\u2019t have children. So actually I knew in advance because when my sisters wrote me that they will invite us, so I told them in advance, they cannot \u2014 we couldn\u2019t get both of them. If I will lucky, I will get probably, but they had to pa \u2014 send the invitation only for one person, for me. And that\u2019s what happened. And I knew for exactly because they told me, you know, in the police when I went with \u2014 with the invitation what I received from my sister, I went to the police, as they told me, immediately. But it\u2019s \u2014 if we will decide, it will go only to you, not \u2014 but not your wife. Because they knew we didn\u2019t have children. So \u2014"

I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t go to United States with this that I will stay here, because if it would be a year before, I would do that, because I knew under communist that I-I would be glad to get rid of the communist government, but now, if starting in spring of 1968 it goes always farther, farther, more liberalization, more democratic things started to come. So everybody thought it will finally get again a democratic Czechoslovak Republic. But in \u2014 with th \u2014 in this time, and [indecipherable] in the United States, 1t was for six weeks what I get the permission. That means the third or the second of September I was supposed to go back, and that was even my airline ticket. But in thi-this time, end of August, the 21\u201c of August, I think, th \u2014 the communists, the Interview with Mikulas Judikovic ms April 14, 1997 Russian and the army from Hungary, from East Germany, from Romania, from Poland, occupied Czechoslovakia, so they closed the borders. So I was in the United States, my wife was actually over there. So, what I have to do? So \u2014 and my wife was in this time in Yugoslavia, on vacation with her cousin, be a \u2014 with a 10 years old boy. So, she immediate \u2014 when the Czechoslovakia occupied, so she immediately went from Yugoslavia back to Czechoslovakia because the parents of the boy were afraid that \u2014 what\u2019s happened. So they \u2014 she went back to Czechoslovakia. I was in the United States, she was over there. And then when what\u2019s happened, so my relatives all, they told me look, we are going to the immigration office. You will stay here, because what\u2019s happened there. We will do everything possible that your wife will come here too. And then, because I told them, I don\u2019t want to stay here if she is there, I am here. So my brother-in-law went with me here in Detroit to the immigration office, and they told me \u2014 I didn\u2019t speak English, so he was the interpreter. They told me yeah, we can make now because this situation is, it will be easier that I could stay here, and we will make everything possible if she can get out from Czechoslovakia, that she will receive immediately visa. But we cannot guarantee how she will get out from there. So I said look, I will go back, I will do \u2014 if I will be there \u2014 because it ose \u2014 and they said don\u2019t worry, they will let her go as soon as we'll go to phone her, we will write her. She will get the permission, she will get out. And I said look, if the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 114 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 Russians are \u2014 if it would be a government under Dub\u00e9ek, it will be different, but this is a government the Russians are there. And I know what it means to live under communists. So never they would let her go \u2014 maybe after awhile or so. And I said, I cannot \u2014 I cannot stay here, I cannot let her there because she doesn\u2019t know all those ways how to go sh \u2014 there. She has no experience in this kind of thing, and I have to go back. The-They were crying, they were bul \u2014 everything, my relatives. And I went back. And when \u2014 interesting enough, one of my nephews \u2014 because I \u2014 one nephew, he had Bar Mitzvah in July here. So I was at the \u2014 the other nephew, his Bar Mitzvah supposed to be in April next year. And he was crying and crying, and said, Uncle Mitu(ph), you are here at the Bar Mitzvah for Stanley, and you won\u2019t be here on my Bar Mitzvah, and I will \u2014 and I told him, Irwin(ph), I promise you, I will do everything possible. When I will be there, I will make all the possible things \u2014 if I couldn\u2019t be here on your Bar Mitzvah, I will be here with you on your wedding with your aunt, with my wife. I make this your promise. And so I went back, but I couldn\u2019t go straight to Czechoslovakia, so I flew from here to Yugoslavia, because I had to change my airline ticket, and I went to the place where my wife was on vacation, she wasn\u2019t there any more. So I went back by train to Prague, and then I met my wife and saw \u2014 and I told her the story and I said, I will try immediately I told her, I will try everything. We have to go back and we have to go to America. We cannot stay because it will be a terror 115 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 here. So, she didn\u2019t want for, she was crying and so on. But then later on th \u2014 I was working on her [indecipherable] and then she saw too what\u2019s going on, how it goes, the situation. So and then we made, sometimes in March, we start with a little more, not so strict like it was the first month. So we went to \u2014 to police, we ask for a permission to go to Hungary for vacation. Yeah, when I came back, people \u2014 friends what I met on the street, they didn\u2019t even greet me to welcome me or something. Everyone only showing knock on the head that I was so st \u2014 they didn\u2019t te \u2014 tell me anything, only to show me that I was stupid that I came back. So then we was working in mat \u2014 thr \u2014 thr \u2014 again through ma \u2014 through this \u2014 her boss, and we get permission to go to Hungary because we had some friends. And then we had to bribe 1n the bank, because you ca \u2014 to go to Yugoslavia. If you wanted to go to Yugoslavia, you had to get a permission from the bank, that the bank gave you currency, Yugoslavian currency, that you go to a vacation for Yugoslavia. So that \u2014 we bribed some clerk in the bank, because it was always a committee who was deciding if they allowed you, if they give you the money, Yugoslavian money that you go \u2014 can go to Yugoslavia. So that\u2019s what it happened, I-I get the permission to go to yu \u2014 th-the money to go into Yugoslavia. So I went again to the police, I had the permission to Yugoslavia, actually [indecipherable] needed. I get the permission there, because I had the per \u2014 the money from Yugoslavia. So I get the per-permission from the police that I can go. 116 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 They put up a\u2014 a stamp in my passport that I can go Yugoslavia. And then we have to bribe someone on the police to a \u2014 a friend of mine. We gave money to him, he gave some money to a policeman. So he gave permission to us that we can go to Yugoslavia through Austria. And it was for 48 hours. And I had the cousin who still lives in Czechoslovakia, in KoSice, and she told me that if I can get the permission to Austria, to Vienna, then I can go to HIAS, to a Hebrew immigration office, and then I can stay and they take care of me to get out from Europe, anywhere. So that what we did to, what I\u2019m saying it\u2019s very simple, but it took much of nerves, a lot of weeks, almost all our money what we got. It cost us money what we bribe. And it was nerve breaking til we get all those papers and everything. So only one cousin of my wife, and my cousin in KoSice, they knew that we are preparing to leave. Even she told me my cousin in KoSice, as soon as wa \u2014 we were b \u2014 lucky and come to Vienna, that I have to write her, and they may \u2014 they \u2014 they will make immediately steps that they will come after us to Vienna. But in between this 1s a other story, her husband changed his mind, he didn\u2019t want [indecipherable] this stay there. And he wa \u2014 he felt sorry til today for visiting last few years them, he felt sorry all the time that he didn\u2019t came after us. Then when we \u2014 so we \u2014 yeah, and then it happened in May the 30\", 1940 \u2014 1969, actually we left Czechoslovakia. And where we lived in the apar \u2014 I had a car already. In this time I bought a car, 1t happens \u2014 this is other story, how it was 117 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 difficult. It was permission from the company, but we had the car. We had the \u2014 we had the application for a new car two years before, because it take always a committee who decided who will get the car, because it was har \u2014 very had to get the car, a permission to buy a car, if you had the money. And you have \u2014 you had to put down 60 percent of the price of the car in a bank. It was blocked in a bank that you had the money. So I had the car about for a year or so. That\u2019s about half [indecipherable] almost a new car. And so we were preparing, we \u2014 so I parked my car in front of the building, it was on a main street. And the day before \u2014 and we had all the permissions and everything. So a day before, to the evening, we started to take some stuff, what we will need for the vacation, and put in the car. Because I had the garage, so we are leave the car over the ma \u2014 overnight in the garage. And because we wanted to leave early in the morning, as soon as possible. So \u2014 and then we \u2014 and I knew from the time when we came back from \u2014 when I came back from America, special then in the months after new year, February, March, we were watching, again by the secret police. And then I was \u2014 when we were taking down all the stuff into the car, and then not far away, maybe 60 or 70 yards, it was a corner, a building, and there was a restaurant. And we saw that some guy in rain clothes \u2014 in plain clothes that\u2019s \u2014 was go \u2014 walking around. And sometime he stopped there, reading a paper, went inside in the restaurant, and from the restaurant was a window straight to our apart \u2014 to the car where \u2014 where I Interview with Mikulas Judikovic \u201c April 14, 1997 was parking. It was about 70 yards. And then again he came out, he ge \u2014 went around the corner, and again get the newspaper, and then to the restaurant. So we knew exactly, because we knew all those kind of things what they are doing because all the secret \u2014 so we knew immediately that someone 1s watching us. So if I describe you, or if you \u2014 I can\u2019t [indecipherable] it wasn\u2019t so smooth. I will try to be really short. And around mor \u2014 in the morning, around 4:30 or five o\u2019clock, it was May the 30\" or the 31\u2018 \u2014 the 31%, we left Liberec and went on the way to Hungary. So we stopped during the night in a little town \u2014 you stop? It then \u2014 then it was Bratislava, it was on the border, actually on Czech and Moravia. And then we stopped during the night in a camp, to stay overnight.

So we went there, and we saw when we were there the soldier took our identification and then we thought that have to go up, we saw a custom guy was standing in \u2014 at the door there. And came out a other custom and Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 120 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 he probably told him, because he showed downstairs, he said probably, those are the people. We come upstairs and he took our papers, and \u2014 both of them, they were standing \u2014 where are you going? And I said that we\u2019re going to Hungary, that we\u2019re going to Yugoslavia, so on. And he said, you know what? Drove \u2014 drive your car behind the building. So I knew immediately it\u2019s not goo \u2014 good. So I drove the car behind the building. There was a \u2014 the long table, and he said okay, but we would like to see what you have in your car. Take out everything from your car. So we took out everything on the car, or took \u2014 or put on the table. And we had our tent, we had [indecipherable], we had a stove, everything like we go for vacation to \u2014 for camping. And what we had in suitcase, everything out. And then he took out \u2014 and that car had the engine in the back, you know it was \u2014 and the \u2014 the \u2014 the trunk was in the front. So, he took the front \u2014 he took out our spare tire. They took \u2014 pull up the battery from the trunk. And it took about an hour, all this checking and everything what they did. And people down on the road, other people were traveling and they left. Everybody were looking up because they saw from \u2014 from the stree \u2014 from the road that we are standing, and customs are standing there, and with all the stuff there. And can you imagine that where the glove department is, there was \u2014 I found out that was a little, like space. And it come to my mind what I had at home with my prayer book. So \u2014 and I found out \u2014 so there I hide some papers, what \u2014 her birth certificate, some other papers.

So if they would find these kind of papers, what we \u2014 why I need papers, my documents, what I went to school, or when my wife \u2014 wife does \u2014 so there I was hidden, but it was so narrow, that later on when I had to take it out, I scratched my hand, because it was very hard to take out. And they opened the glove department, they looked behind, but didn\u2019t realize, because it was something like hidden, so they didn\u2019t see that this is \u2014 this 1s actually a \u2014 a secret space there. This was \u2014 they were lucky. So after about an hour they didn\u2019t find \u2014 they didn\u2019t find the space there. After about an hour or so, and even \u2014 you know I said it\u2019s \u2014 I \u2014 I have to \u2014 to mention, my wife used to make iyer(ph) cognac, natur \u2014 because she liked it, so here and there she tried to st \u2014 you know what\u2019s iyer(ph) cognac 1s now? This is a \u2014 a liqueur, this 1s made from eggs \u2014 eggs and liqueur, you know, and it\u2019s very \u2014 so sweet, you can hardly get drunk or so. And the oth \u2014 on the way, she usually lit \u2014 taked a \u2014 from the \u2014 from the bottle, a taste, and til we came there to the customs, she was a \u2014 a little so in good mood, you know. And suddenly when it was all over with the checking [indecipherable] everything was outside, and suddenly she stepped like this and she said, gentlemen, could you tell me Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 122 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 please, what are you looking for? Maybe I can help you. And I said, be quiet. We don\u2019t be th \u2014 nasty to gen \u2014 because I saw that they \u2014 they were a little so \u2014 not so \u2014 so straight, like they were before when the \u2014 they were so strict, they were talking to us like we were some robberies or something, or criminals. And then in to the end, after an hour, both of them were so \u2014 a little softer. And I told her [indecipherable] quiet, don\u2019t \u2014 and okay, so \u2014 and she says so, can I put back the \u2014 yeah, you can. So okay, so [indecipherable] and so she started slowly with here, and I said, take everything through it in. If they would let us go, we will be \u2014 as soon as we can be away from it better. Okay, then I help her, we started to threw it only in the car and everything. And then they told us, come \u2014 come with the car in the front of the building, stop there. Because they had all the papers, everything. So, I stopped there and so they let you go, but then he stopped, and I said okay. They gave the papers, and I said, you know when \u2014 and when you went from Czechoslovakia, you had to fill out a piece of paper, what you are taking out. And then you had to show on the border when you come back, if you brought it \u2014 everything back and what you brought back. And I said, but yo \u2014 I have the passport and the papers, I don\u2019t have the paper what it says when I come back and show the \u2014 the \u2014 for the customs what I took out and what took back. And he says, I gave it to you. And I said, but I don\u2019t have here. Yeah, and th \u2014 and then my wife says, oh, maybe yeah, I think I have here between the papers, I have it. So \u2014 and I 123 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 said, because we have to \u2014 and I told them even, I \u2014 we have to be back because my wife has some examinations, she went to \u2014 to a college school and took courses, she took \u2014 and I said, three days later she had the examinations, so we have to bring back, and I don\u2019t want to have some troubles when I come back. I gave it to your wife. Again. Well, she says, maybe I as \u2014 my wife said, maybe I have here. So we went, we came, yeah, and we stayed there on our seaside \u2014 not seaside, it was a big lake where we have friends who usually we stayed o \u2014 for vacations every year. So we thought we will stay there for a week or 10 days with them. So we stopped there, and we say we are going to Yugoslavia and we will stay for a few days. Who said \u2014 and the la \u2014 the \u2014 our friend says oh, that\u2019s good, good, good, we\u2019ll stay \u2014 and then during the night I couldn\u2019t sleep, it was from Saturday to Sunday, I remember like today. And I said, you know what \u2014 I told my wife, I think so \u2014 I would stay not one more day, because if they made those search on the border, they immediately sent a cable to Liberec that we went to the gi \u2014 border, they let us. And if we will stay in Hungary, this 1s still a communist country, they can make immediately there\u2019s a stop in Hungary, and they send us back. And I said, today is Sunday, they \u2014 the office is in Liberec closed. So better if as soon as we'll go away \u2014 okay, my wife didn\u2019t want to, so [indecipherable] says, that\u2019s okay, we go. So I turned to my friend, listen, you know we wanted better we will stop more days in Yugoslavia, and then we will come back sooner, 124 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 we will stay with you when we come back, because it doesn\u2019t say that \u2014 we want so \u2014 at least two or three days or so, and I says no, we better because they said it\u2019s a nice weather there in yugo \u2014 okay, so we went. We came to the border on Hungary and Yugoslavia. They stopped us, they told us the Hungarian customs, wait in the car. So we wait in the car. We wait five minute, 10 minutes, 15 minutes long, nobody came out. So then I said oh, this is not good. And I said because maybe from Bratislava they sent a message to the Hungarian border to stop us and to check us. So it took about 20 minutes. Other people were coming down, other customs let them go, only to [indecipherable] and us they st \u2014 we were sitting in the car from 20 minutes. And then suddenly they came out, they pull up the hood, they pull up the hood for the engine, they pull up the hood from the trunk. And there were \u2014 in front of us was a boss, you know people were standing, came around, people standing around, you know, they were nose \u2014 no \u2014 no \u2014 mousey \u2014 nosey to see what\u2019s going on. So it took about five, 10 minute here. He took everything back up, something he took out, then put back, you know the Hungarian customs. Then said \u2014 take the steps. Okay, you can go. We can \u2014 and immediately was the border, it was only a small river, a bridge. We came \u2014 immediately was the Yugoslavian customs. Came to Yugoslavian customs, I show them the paper, open the window. Immediately, okay, you taking, what you are going, for how long, I said oh, he gave the stamp. We left . Well, we came to 125 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 Yugoslavia, so we went to the seaside, about \u2014 and we thought that we will stay there til we will go to Austria, we will stay about for a few days, a little, to relax."

So that \u2014 that was a so \u2014 then, we came to Vienna, it was sometime late in the evening, and it \u2014 the next day it was a holiday in \u2014 in the Austria. So we stayed in a camp. The next day we went immediately in the morning to HIAS, and I registered, and then was \u2014 I spoke German. And then was on HIAS in the office a woman, make a registration, and so on. And I had my papers, I took out my birth certificate and so on. And he was still proof if I am really Jewish. And he said \u2014 he asked me the question, so if you are Jewish, where is the \u2014 what 1s the highest holiday in our religion? I said, Yom Kippur. And I said, you know what?

I \u2014 I didn\u2019t talk about the pull down the 127 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 pants. Yeah, so \u2014 and the women \u2014 we were laughing. She says, yeah, yeah. And she says, don\u2019t be mad, because we had, after the Russian came in, we had many people, Christian who came here and they said that they are Jews, because they knew that the Jewish organizations take more care of them than the Christians in their o-organizations, you know, the Catholics and all these organizations. Say, Christians came and they had \u2014 and the woman told me, we had many occasions that Christians came to us, and we had to send them, give them the address we had, the Catholic organizations. So \u2014 and we stayed there, but now you could see in Vienna, people who were escaping from Czechoslovakia. Left cars on the street, left cars on the airport, because they couldn\u2019t sell. Everybody was glad to get rid, because they \u2014 as soon as they get permission go to Canada, to Australia, to Sweden, to America immediately. They di \u2014 they left everything there. And I had almost a new car, so \u2014 and I told this guy who asked me about the high holidays, you know, I said, do you know what? I have almost a new car, and I would like to get some money, because we don\u2019t have money, we don\u2019t have currency, nothing. If someone would give me some few shillings, some few hundreds, or some dollars or so. He says, you know what? I have a friend, he has a dealership, maybe he will buy because he\u2019s a Czechoslovak guy and sells Czechoslovak cars, wa \u2014 running, because Czechoslovakia was exporting some cars to Austria. So I went there, yeah, we stayed there in \u2014 in the \u2014 yeah, and they Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 128 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 ga-gave us a address where we can go to stay a few nights til we\u2019re \u2014 that transport, because they started to, in this time were people, many people came from Hungary, from Czechoslovakia, from Poland, many people. So they made always a transport train \u2014 car, went straight to Rome, because in Rome, the HIAS was the main concentration, the main office. So after a \u2014 the second or third day he told me, you know what? Go show \u2014 there he gave me the address. Show the car, he probably will buy from you. So I went there, he liked the car, so he \u2014 he bought the car. So at least I didn\u2019t have to leave the car. He gave me, I don\u2019t know how many hundred dollars. So at least we had [indecipherable] some money. And I left the car with everything there, so I said, at least something. And then, usually after three or four days they make \u2014 they had the \u2014 had th-the 30 or 40 people, some a\u2014 sometimes even 70 people, so they made two rail cars, and send to Vienna. And \u2014 yo, and everybody has to go immediately, HIAS sent you to a doctor, he was a Jewish doctor, originally from Poland, but he lived in Austria for many years already, like for a check-up if you are capable, if you are able to go to take the [indecipherable] to go, or [indecipherable] to go to Rome. And we went there, and I started to tell him a little bit the story, what I went through, the few days. And I said, you know doctor, I\u2019ve ba \u2014 ba \u2014 ap \u2014 appealed to you. We \u2014 my wife is not so healthy and I \u2014 you know, always this nervous break, what was. If you can give her some medication and to check her up more and after three or 129 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 four days, if something really was happened, because she has kidney problems \u2014 problems, and it was true. And he told he \u2014 he started to talk to my Yiddish. And he says, in Yiddish, you know, tell me the truth, Vienna is a nice city. Probably you want to stay to see the city. And I telled him, you know what, it\u2019s one of the reasons too. A-And he said, you know what? I give you, you will stay two weeks in Vienna. Stay, but you know, and I thought to my wife \u2014 to myself, better to tell the truth straight and what happens, happen. And he \u2014 then he told me, you know, I like you because you told me that you liked to stay in Vienna. So then we \u2014 we stayed in Vienna for two weeks, so we looked a little, and at least it helped us, special me, get a little \u2014 a normal feeling, a normal life, because no \u2014 otherwise, I was on the bottom, really. I was completely eshi \u2014 exhausted \u2014 exhausted. So then we stayed there, and then we, after two weeks they send us to \u2014 to Rome. There we registered in the HIAS, and immediately \u2014 1t was very good organized there, and immediately they gave us \u2014 because in Rome there were all over signs that say, lease apartments, special for refugees becal \u2014 twas meant \u2014 so, we took out an apartment. And the hia \u2014 HIAS, actually Joint, gave the money that what we paid for the rent, and they gave some pocket money that you can buy some food or something, minimum, but it was enough. And after three months or so, because when I went in Czechoslovakia gymnasium, I learned Latin, we had the subject Latin. So after three months I started to speak Italian. So then was the \u2014 the \u2014 the 130 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 president in HIAS was a Romanian woman who spoke \u2014 spoke Hungarian. And then as \u2014 she saw that I spoke Italian, I spoke Hungarian, and I spoke Polish, and I spoke Russian, I spoke Czech. So \u2014 and the other woman my \u2014 my \u2014 who was in charge, my caseworker, she was a Romanian too, and she spoke \u2014 spoke Hungarian too. So said one thing to other, and I talked to them, so they hired me that I was a interpreter in HIAS for all those people, because many people came, special from Poland, from Hungary, from Romania. So I was working one year approximately on HIAS like a interpreter. So, me, my wife actually stayed in Rome 15 months. And between this time it helped a lot, because we received money like refugees, like everybody else. And beside that, Joint paid me like a employee on HIAS. So we started to travel a little bit in Italy, and I spoke Italian. So actually in \u2014 was in \u2014 my job was there. At least once a week, sometimes twice a week, I went to the railroad station in Rome every \u2014 1n the morning, around eight o\u2019clock in the morning. And always came one railroad car, or two cars, it depends how many people came. And in ad \u2014 in advance, I had all the names who is coming, how many people. And I have to tell you, I \u2014 some Italian police were accompanying each car from the border to Rome, that nobody can come in in those car. No Italian police to check if regular or not. And when they came to Rome to me at those stations, they knew me already, all those people. I [inaudible] have to tell you, I gave them money, because I had \u2014 I \u2014 I had the Interview with Mikulas Judikovic mt April 14, 1997 envelope from the Joint, from \u2014 I gave the two guys envelope and I told them \u2014 they told me, buongiorno Mikula, buongiorno. A come sta, how you feel and so on. I said, buongiorno signore, I gave them the envelope, arrivederci. And that\u2019s was I took over all the people I took them to HIAS for registration. There they get all \u2014 they received all the instruction farther, and then I was working [indecipherable] people to give adva \u2014 adva \u2014 advice, to help them what I have to do. And then I took all the pa \u2014 what someone had introduce on different consulates, you know for the visas or so on. So I went with them to interpret on the \u2014 on the consulate because I spoke Italian there. And then I took all the passports, and all papers, translation, everything, to all those consulates for what \u2014 for \u2014 for verification, because usually they get permission, the Italian government gave permission for refugees for three months. Who stayed longer, I had to go to the police, I had to go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get permission. So that\u2019s what I did for HIAS, what I went then \u2014 and then all the transport, what all they sent for example, many people to Canada or to us, or I accompanied these people to the airport. And sometimes people came illegally to \u2014 they send them from Belgrade or from Bucharest. So I went to the airport, I took over those people and took to the \u2014 not to the e-exit with other people, but to the \u2014 to the Italian police, you know, to the commandant of the airport. And he knew everything, so he gave the permission, and then when I took them to HIAS, you Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 132 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 know, because those people didn\u2019t have visas. So that\u2019s what I \u2014 I did. I did a lot of this kind of things what helped people actually to come to Italy and then to help them to \u2014 to make translation, that \u2014 like a [indecipherable] a translator to them, even privately with the \u2014 with the \u2014 when they were looking for apartments, and so on. So I was busy enough, but during the weekend I could go out, so I can relax a little bit, so that\u2019s \u2014 we stayed there."

Even they gave it to someone or someone \u2014 someone bought it. So an \u2014 for example, it was \u2014 and they took here and we \u2014 we were \u2014 after awhile when they saw that they \u2014 we didn\u2019t came back, they sentenced us, me and my wife to two years in prison in ab \u2014 in absentia, because we left illegally.

So when they started to liquidate \u2014 before they started liquidate all our furnitures, and everything, so my wife\u2019s mother went to the police. She wanted to get at least the couch what we had. She had to buy it, and it took her a lot of work. She get, and she had to pay the police to get the couch what belongs to her daughter. So she has \u2014 I told her \u2014 later she had enough guts even to go to the police, first of all. So then the first \u2014 the first \u2014 1946 - \u00b047, I used to go to a shul in Liberec. It was a small minyan, few Jews. But then when, special from 1948, it was very dangerous to show that you are religious, or you are keeping the \u2014 the \u2014 your faith, special Jewish faith. Even Christians, Christians were, under communism, were afraid to go to a church. They didn\u2019t go, even they were religious. So then \u2014 and when I came back, in 1991, after 22 years, to Czechoslovakia, and I went to Liberec \u2014 so the first thing Friday evening I went \u2014 because I have a friend of mine, a Jewish guy who lived there, and I ask him, do you still have prayer, do you have some Jews here and so on. He says, hardly we make a minyan on Friday evening. So I said, I-I came there, and I came there Friday evening and made the minyan til we were about 10 or 11 people with \u2014 including me. And later \u2014 so then \u2014 oh, and this time was more, the later and later years, in 1933 - \u00b034, it was hardly a minyan. So and some people told me, you know, I remember when I had about, in 1946 \u2014 \u201947 a old guy, so I remember you used to come, and so on. And then later on they had very few re \u2014 Jews. And then Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 134 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 they came, for example, for the high holidays, they came Jews from cities or from villages who were about 10 - 20 miles away from Michalovee, so they came for the high holidays [indecipherable] little like one room what they have there.

And then 1-in last few years, I was there last time about two years ago, yeah, two years ago, because I went every year there, Friday. And then later years I gave him I \u2014 a sum of money, I spent them some \u2014 left them some dollars to help him. And they were very grateful always. And now finally they\u2019re \u2014 after \u2014 after 1990, when it was [break] In 1991, there in Liberec [indecipherable] the whole house, so there was some apartments. Upstairs they were renting it. Downstairs, they had two rooms with everything, with Torahs and everything, with some curtains. And now, after about two or three years ago, they decided, and there in Liberec, where the German 1938 on Kristallnacht, they destroyed a beautiful, beautiful, nice, big synagogue, they \u2014 the Czechoslovak government and the Jewish organizations from Prague gave some money, and they are starting, I think, last year to build so-called library. But the main part of the library will be a Jewish synagogue with everything like a 135 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 normal synagogue. Two years ago I say \u2014 I-I \u2014 they showed me the whole plan, even they have in \u2014 on tapes, pictures how the building will \u2014 will look, and it will be a bi \u2014 because now it is there a parking lot.

So I am looking forward next \u2014 no, this year in \u2014 in September, I am going there, so \u2014 to Liberec so \u2014 because I will be in Prague and I will be staying in a spa. We are going there almost every year, there 1s a spa not far from Liberec, about 15 miles. It\u2019s for arthritis and it helps us, so there we are going every year. So I will go there, I will talk to my friend, and I'll look how far, what this \u2014 because last year I couldn\u2019t go there, I \u2014 even I was in the Czech Republic, but wait, I was there? Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, but it wasn\u2019t started yet, so I hope that started. And even he called me last year, and they received a van, because they have like a small community there now, about 15 people, about eight or nine families who live there. And they received a van, a used van from Germany, but they didn\u2019t have papers. So one day he wro-wro \u2014 I\u2019m sorry \u2014 he wrote me a letter that if a \u2014 if I can ge \u2014 get someone papers from here, from General Motors, because it was a General Motors van, because otherwise the police in Liberec, they couldn\u2019t get Czechoslovak papers for the va- van because it was a present and they don\u2019t have the papers. So I called General 136 Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997 Motors here.
