So I was working one year in HIAS in Rome, like an interpreter. So I stayed 15 months, you know \u2014 and by the way, I used to go the first time, after 22 years to go to a shul, to a synagogue, because in Czechoslovakia, first of all, we to \u2014 under communism it was very dangerous to show that you are religious, or you going \u2014 secondly, there was no Jews, so I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to go. So I went to a little shul there in Rome, and suddenly I took a prayer book and I found in the prayer book a card what was a ticket, a steady ticket, a year\u2019s ticket for my father for the streetcars in Prague.

And he survived, and ya \u2014 as sla \u2014 as far as he knows, he said, I don\u2019t know if someone else survived.

So we heard that are concentration camp, but was in later, in 1944 or something like that. And by the way, this like, is not hear because I \u2014I don\u2019t know if you want to put on tape. About four years ago, my wife said \u2014 alee \u2014 that we are reading the \u2014 we are receiving a Czech newspaper, it comes from New York, what are news from Czechoslovakia and so on. And one day we saw a article there that some Jews who are even outside Czechoslovakia and who can prove that they were in concentration camp, or in the army with th-the Russians always there, England. They can get some compensation, because the Germans sent some money to the Czech re \u2014 Czechoslovakia, and it will be like some compensation because they were in concentration camp.

So she says, you know what? I will try to write application for some people. Maybe they will get. And I do \u2014I thou \u2014 I mentioned to my brother-in-law, and he said to a friend of ours. So we wrote application, and really was happen, and we had t-to write the first application to the Ministry of Defense. They will prove \u2014 they could prove if you have \u2014 that you were like persecuted in a labor camp. And then they give a paper, so-called law number 255. This 1s a law, a Czechoslovak law what recognized that you were persecuted, and you were eligible in certain advantages. For example, like I have the 255, I \u2014 and I get because I worked in Czechoslovakia more than 25 years, I have pension, because I am eligible on normal pension. And I\u2019m better, if I get the normal pension, that I will get compensation through the Germans.

The factory actually received people to work from the sod \u2014 concentration camp. It was for a hundred people, 150 people. So I went there into the da \u2014 and suddenly, when these people received the money, he said \u2014 the one friend told to the other friend you wouldn\u2019t believe, we are almost 50 people, what we made applications from \u2014 beside that, two years ago came new laws in Czechoslovakia, so it\u2019s more complicated. You need more proof, more papers. So I went to the library in the Holocaust Museum, I took all the addresses, because we had to write to all those concentration camp.

And they were Russians who either escaped from labor camp, or escaped from the [indecipherable] some out from the army or so. So \u2014 and then later on, actually these Russians, because mostly about six or seven of them were officers. So then, they made a special battalion and other Russians started to come, because actually \u2014 and when the uprising came in August 1944 to Banska Bystrica, the Russian sent some Russian people to help for alph \u2014 uprising. So actually many Russian people then stayed there, even the Russian army told them to stay there and help through the uprising. So hundred and hundred of Russian people stayed there in Slovakia. So that\u2019s where I get there in \u2014 sometime November or so, with the Russian. But you know, with the partisans in this time were so \u2014 we were, for example, one battalion. And suddenly we were in fighting with the German and they were \u2014 we were overpowered. So suddenly, like we disappeared, 10 people here, three people there, 40 people there. So it took time, even weeks sometimes to get put together again. Sometime it happened that, for example [indecipherable] occasion sometimes in December, I was with about 16 or 18 people. We were wandering about for three weeks, til we find the other bigger \u2014 larger group."

Life you know, the \u2014 the li \u2014 the human life is so unpredictable. And in 1946, I met his sister, she survived the Holocaust. She was a year younger than he was. And it was hard for me, and I met her in \u2014 in Prague. And she somehow \u2014 I don\u2019t know if she knew us, we were talking and talking, and then we were talking about the brother. And he was \u2014 she was really suspicious that I knew about him, or she [indecipherable] us. And then I told him, you know, Vera, I was with your brother during the war.

Can you tell me where he is buried? And I told her, Vera, I am sorry to tell you that I cannot tell you, because I know it was in the forest, it was like out of the forest, it was like a free space, but usually the people were \u2014 are buried, those people, I cannot tell you, but I know it was about 10 kilometers from Kleiner(ph), 12 kilometers. But I ge \u2014 well, 1t was very hard. And the next year, in 1947, I think she moved there to Australia.

Because actually Prague, and the mostly part of Czechoslovakia, the American army was actually on the outskirts of Prague, and the Russian didn\u2019t let them farther to go, and the Russians were far away, because they said it was agreement between Russia and the United States. So the American army had to pull back, move west approximately to the city of Posen in Czeska(ph) Budavitsa(ph) and then they stayed.

And I can tell you, I have to mention maybe that they let me go after a few days or so, 1f \u2014 it was because my wife, she was working in an office, and her president of the office wi \u2014 because it was a \u2014 for the \u2014 the main office for all the restaurants there, it was about 1500 people. He had some connection, the \u2014 her boss had some connection with the police. So my wife probably told him, so he actually, through my \u2014 my wife, through him, heard that the police let me go. But that\u2019s later on, like I mentioned, my wife later on couldn\u2019t keep high position jobs because they knew that her husband has relatives in America, so they didn\u2019t trust her.

And her boss was great, because she did many work what she \u2014 he\u2019s supposed to job \u2014 do. So actually, he didn\u2019t have to work so much, and other people who were in charge. So actually, they used her to work more because the- they knew that she has to if she wants to keep even the lower job.

And so the \u2014 actually, all those years, we were living with my wife, we couldn\u2019t travel so much like we would like to. And they were watching \u2014 they were watching us, all our steps.

So they knew what they \u2014 what th-they are writing. And this taught me \u2014 someone later on af \u2014 sometime in the 60s, I think he was in the secret police, I am not sure, but I knew he \u2014 I went to school with him. And he \u2014 one day he was drunk, and I met him, so \u2014 and he started to talk and I was asking him, so I felt between his word what he was talking, that that \u2014 that\u2019s what the police, because he told me actually, they said, look, we knew everything, what\u2019s going on everybody, because we knew in a \u2014 everything what\u2019s going on because we had equipment what we [indecipherable].
