            "answer": "Circumstances, okay. Well, I was in the labor came and one day my older friend approached me and said, Cornell, next morning when the train pulls out from the station, you and I are staying, and we going to hide someplace. We are not leaving with this train. Cause the train was going on and on and on of cour se. And, of course, my -- my closest friends were my age, see, he was a little bit older, maybe wiser, and he had certain ideas, you see. So next day as the train was ready to pull out, and that USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0056 4was in hunga -- Hungary, of course, he -- the train started to move and I had sort of, you know my younger friends, they were all going up on a train and I was ready to move on the train and he grabbed -- fortuna tely he grabbed my arm, he says, we\u2122re staying. And we didn\u2122t stay. And the trai n pulled out, and then we hit the road, and we walked on the highway. And after awhile we got off the highway, because it was dangerous, you know, trucks were comi ng with Hungarian soldiers, and maybe German soldiers, we didn\u2122t want to stay on the highway, too ob vious. So we moved off the highway and about maybe quarter of a mile, half a mile, and there was some water there, and some little river, and we just sat down there and was waiting for the dark. We\u2122re thinking what\u2122s going to happen now, see? Actually it was -- well, it was Hungary in no -- ru -- th-that -- it was Romania, Romania at that time, yeah, because it was always back and forth Hungary and Romania and back and forth. And before it got dark, some Hungarian soldiers st opped on the highway and came towards the river. So we got sort of a little bit scared, but then you have to act cool, right? And as they were getting closer and closer, we got up and we waved to them. [indecipherable] come over here, here is the river, see? Came over, sa -- and they came over and then one of them asked us, he says, what are you doing? We says, ah, we got late -- we got off the train -- w-we missed the train, we\u2122re waiting. Oh. They didn\u2122t make a big issue out of it, we\u2122re lu cky. Then they left. Later it became dark. A Romanian farmer came across the river and he said he is willing to hide us. So all right. Actually it was four of us, yeah, this older guy, me and two other guys USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0056 5[indecipherable]. So, we accepted, what choice do you have, right? So we went -- he took us to his little farm and we went upstairs in his barn and we were hiding there. We were hiding for a few days and suddenl y we hear guns, guns, guns, Russian guns getting closer and closer. We had food, we fed us potatoes, we\u2122re not hungry, had water and everything. And -- and then he came -- one evening he cames over and he said the Russians are next door in the next village, but they celebrating. So, d -- you know, how long are they gonna celebrate? But two days later they came, the Russians and the Romanians. First thing is a Romanian soldier I remember, first thing he did, he took my watch. So wa -- so I asked him, I says -- some -- somewhat we conversed, you know. I said, why are you taking my watch? He says, I have to give it to the Russians. [indecipherable] okay. Th e next Romanian took my shoes, which I didn't mind because it had nails from inside , you know? So he gave me his shoes. I think it was a good trade. Anyway, so then we -- no, says, well let\u2122s start an -- let\u2122s start walking. Walking the -- th-the aim, the goal was to reach his hometown in Hungary, which was probably hundred miles from there, roughly. So we\u2122re walking, maybe we get some rides. So we walked on the highway, see? And so the Russian Cossacks on horses on the highway, shooting apple off th e trees, and all that. And then came a Russian -- Russian soldiers, you know, on -- on -- on trucks, they stopped, and they asked us, they said wh at -- who are you? Says, well we are, you know, we were in labor camps. Th-Th -- actually didn\u2122t know exactly what you are talking about, this -- they didn\u2122t know. What do they know? So it\u2122s -- one USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0056 6[indecipherable] ask who -- who -- where you from? I says, I am from Yugoslavia. He says, wh-wh-why aren\u2122t yo u fighting with the partisans? [indecipherable] going to explain it. But anyway -- and I spoke Russian, fortunately. That was another thing by the way, my f -- my -- my f -- older friend was smart too, he knew with me -- he was going need the Russian language. So he was not stupid. So I spoke Russian. Okay, so oh, oh, all right, fine, fine. And a Jewish officer, Russian officer came over and was talking to me, so, are you Jewish? I say yes. He says, okay, I am too, he says, but be quiet, don\u2122t tell the Russian soldier that I\u2122m -- they don\u2122t know that I am Jewish. Interesting. I don\u2122t recall now if that truck, or we -- I think we took a ride with them, they took us for a few miles, 20 - 30 - 40 miles, then we got off again. Well, eventually, in about two days, we got into his hometown. His wife was there, of course, his wife was a Gentile. He was also half Jewish like I was, I didn't mention that. His wife was Gentile, of course. And in his hometown, there\u2122s absolutely no sign or war. There was no sign of war, it was peace. Food like in the peacetime. Duck, geese, anything, it was just [indecipher able]. So we s -- I s -- the two guys and myself, we staying by their ho use, and we stayed with them, of course. The name of the city was Bekes-Gyula. It was about maybe 60 miles from Budapest --"

And I had a brother who was in Borr, Borr was a famous camp, you probably hear d about it, the copper mines, you know, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0056 7and they took from Hungary, these kids to Borr in \u212244. Later I -- somehow I found out through somebody who came from Budapest that my parents are alive, but my brother died, he was killed in Borr. He was murdered in Borr. Later, after the war, my cousin went to Borr by the way an d recovered his body and brought his body back to Novi Sad, to my hometown, wher e he was buried. Now, the idea was to get to Budapest, but Budapest was not liberated yet, that time, well, they were still fighting for Budapest. And then I got a job as an interpreter with -- in a Russian h-hospital. The commander was Jewish, by th e way. We became sort of friends."

Sure enough, we went to Budapest with him, with the Russian commander, and arrived in Buda pest -- it was unbelievable, of course. People starving on the streets, coming over to the truck, begging for food, will give you anything. Gold rings, what ever you have, for a loaf of bread. Was pathetic. And the city looked, of course, terrible. It was just a day after liberation, still t -- heard shootings and everything. And now the id ea was to find my parents. Well, I knew where they lived, see, because I lived in an apartment too, before I went to labor camp. So that was no problem to find them. So we -- we drove over there, with the truck. And my mother opened the door. Sh e didn't know I was coming, of course, she USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0056 8opened the door, and she saw me, it was unbe lievable, you know, like ah. She didn\u2122t know the circumstances. And then -- course we talked about my brother and everything, and they were in good shape, th ey were lucky, and then -- of course we invited -- the Russian commander stayed there in the apartment, he s -- he lived there. We -- I don\u2122t know how long I will stay, but I was very lucky. I remember one day in Budapest, I was walking down the stre et, and came these Russian soldiers, surrounded a whole block and took every man, every man from that block, they took into a backyard, into a big backyard, a sc hoolyard or something. I did not like the idea, I knew there is something wrong here, something is goi ng to happen. So I said, I better work fast here. So I found a soldier in the group there, and I told him, hey, do me a favor. Go over to this place -- I gave him my mother\u2122s address -- find my commander, and tell him to come over here immediately, I need him. I was very, very lucky, cause the Russians were unreliable, very unreliable people. Big liars and unreliable. Now, first of all, he has to find the place. He\u2122s not a Hungarian, you know? I just give him an address. Then, he has to go, to begin with. And then he has -- and then he has to find the commander in the house and bring him over here, because this is a matter of time now, right. He did go. He did bring the commander, and the commander came in. I told him what the story is -- well, he knew, so he talked to the commander in the yard and told him, this is -- I need this man, he is my interpreter. I need him, you have to release him. Okay, that\u2122s it. He saved me. I don\u2122t have to tell you what happened to the re st of the people. Russia. Took them to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0056 9Russia. Many of them probably died. Matter of fact, not in that group, but I know my father\u2122s -- one of his good friends from Yu goslavia originally, who was in a German concentration camp, and who came back liberated from ra -- from Germany, was caught in one of these Russian affairs, you know, taken to Russia and died in Russia.

Of course, my mother did convert, you know, but they didn\u2122t know that, originally. And then she had the opportunity to save a lot of Jewish people from this apartment house. They were moved, before, to another apartment house, downtown Budapest and my mother used to take food there. Yeah, she ta-take them -- took them food, let he r in, you know, and one time one of the guards I think was objecting and so forth, and what she said, you have to let me in because these people owe me money.

Then I went back to -- I was going back and fort h from this Bekes-Gyula, you know, where I lived with my friend, because th -- I lived there, actually. I didn't move right away back to Budapest. And we used to do so me funny business, we went to Romania from Hungary and smuggled certain things. Like one time we smuggled a carload of sugar, and the Romanians mixed it with salt, so we had to thro w the whole thing -- that reminded me, Stalin -- Stalin said once, he says, Romanians are not a nation, they\u2122re a profession. It\u2122s true. Was very, very disgusting, but what can you do? Amazing. I told the story the other day to a Romanian guy about the sugar, so he said USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0056 11right away, they mixed it with salt, didn\u2122t they? So he knew. This was now, in 1999. See, a Romanian. Takes a Romanian to know. But my friend, by the way, where I lived in -- in -- interestingly enough, I remember he had a brother who lived in London, who went to London before the war, and he was on the British Broadcasting Corporation, yes? His name was Haytai. I d on\u2122t know what happened to him. I don\u2122t know what happened to the brother. I know one thing, the brother where we lived, it was very nice, and the wife was nice, but th ey were constantly fighting, which made it sort of unpleasant sometimes, you know, to live and stay and eat in a place where the -- th-the host and the hostess constantly fight. The reason I don\u2122t know. But anyway, he was too much in business, he was a businessman and preoccupied with business, and I think that\u2122s what she obj ected to. She was fairly young woman yet, you know, the man comes back after, you kn ow, so many years from a labor camp and then he -- 99 percent he spends in bus iness, you know, and on e percent with the wife. But then -- then eventually, of course, we split because I did go back to Budapest and -- and stayed with my pare nts. Now the goal at that time was eventually to go to America where my older brother -- Masha, I\u2122m sure mentioned it to you, Ernest le -- came in 1938, he stayed here. So we have to get somehow out here, and -- and the parents were working on it, too, but I had to leave, somehow, Hungary and go to Austria, so rt of the bridge, then from Austria to America. So I had [indecipherable] first to cross the border. Couldn\u2122t go it le gally. So at night, with one of my good friends who was with me in the labor camp, he was -- by the way, I don\u2122t USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0056 12know if I mentioned it before, that a lot of the guys were killed from -- on that train when we left -- oh, I didn\u2122t say that, yeah, where he pulled me away from the train and the train went on, lot of these kids we re -- lot of them were murdered later in Czechoslovakia."

So whoever escaped [indecipherable] well, anyway, so at night we crossed the border, paid a few forints, or whatever, panguat, I don\u2122t remember the currency, and we crossed the border and came to Austria. So then we went to Vienna first and then [indecipherable] I was to get to a displaced camp, and we knew about two displaced camps in Linz, Linz on the Danube. It\u2122s between Salzburg and Vienna, about halfway. And so we went to this -- that was easy when you get to a displaced camp, right away you register, you know. First we went to Lakeside, which was pretty lousy conditions, but then we went to Bindermichl. Now Bindermichl was like a -- a Hilton in comparison with Lakeside, right? And got a nice room, kitchen facilities. So -- he was married, by the way, my friend, married. And so we stayed there, he and his wife and myself. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0056 13"

The commander was a lieutenant, nice guy, alcoholic, was drinking, you know? And just did what he had to do. Were never any beatings, were never any threatening. Matter of fact, we didn\u2122t know at that time what was really going on, except once, where in the very beginning for instance, on weekends, I used to go back to Budapest, to my parents on weekends, it was so easy.

And USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0056 55then I asked the man where he was born, an d he said he\u2122s -- he\u2122s from Vestva and that\u2122s a part of Germany, and as it happens, my father\u2122s grandfather came from Vestva, so he could have been a relative. Bu t he was not a nice guy, he was not a nice lawyer. Very unfriendly, very uncooperative, and as I say, he was very negative. So I said to my wife, you know, wasting time here, nothing we can do.

Nice, huh? And, again, it\u2122 s only a nominal fee, she says, nothing, nothing to get excited about. Well, that is her opinion, but I don\u2122t know, I\u2122m still expecting an answer from a -- I think Chic ago is the lawyer. [indecipherable] even happens if -- well, sure I should get some compensation, being in a camp. It was a labor camp, it was a slave labor camp, you know? I-I didn't go there voluntarily, best years of my life. Spent there, how many times [indecipherable] about two years. I have pictures also, I have photos from th e camp, which is unusual, a lot of people don\u2122t, of course, you know, yeah, but I was in the camp there with the commander, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0056 56with the sergeant and the whole thing, the whole group of people.
