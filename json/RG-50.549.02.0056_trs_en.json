            "question": "-- since this is sort of the official introduction. And now that we know who is talking to us, I would like to begin with liberation. How was liberation for you, when was it, and -- and what kind of state of mind were you?",
            "answer": "Circumstances, okay. Well, I was in the labor came and one day my older friend approached me and said, Cornell, next morning when the train pulls out from the station, you and I are staying, and we going to hide someplace. We are not leaving with this train. Cause the train was going on and on and on of course. And, of course, my -- my closest friends were my age, see, he was a little bit older, maybe wiser, and he had certain ideas, you see. So next day as the train was ready to pull out, and that was in hunga -- Hungary, of course, he -- the train started to move and I had sort of, you know my younger friends, they were all going up on a train and I was ready to move on the train and he grabbed -- fortunately he grabbed my arm, he says, we\u2019re staying. And we didn\u2019t stay. And the train pulled out, and then we hit the road, and we walked on the highway. And after awhile we got off the highway, because it was dangerous, you know, trucks were coming with Hungarian soldiers, and maybe German soldiers, we didn\u2019t want to stay on the highway, too obvious. So we moved off the highway and about maybe quarter of a mile, half a mile, and there was some water there, and some little river, and we just sat down there and was waiting for the dark. We\u2019re thinking what\u2019s going to happen now, see? Actually it was -- well, it was Hungary in no -- ru -- th-that -- it was Romania, Romania at that time, yeah, because it was always back and forth Hungary and Romania and back and forth. And before it got dark, some Hungarian soldiers stopped on the highway and came towards the river. So we got sort of a little bit scared, but then you have to act cool, right? And as they were getting closer and closer, we got up and we waved to them. [indecipherable] come over here, here is the river, see? Came over, sa -- and they came over and then one of them asked us, he says, what are you doing? We says, ah, we got late -- we got off the train -- w-we missed the train, we\u2019re waiting. Oh. They didn\u2019t make a big issue out of 1t, we\u2019re lucky. Then they left. Later it became dark. A Romanian farmer came across the river and he said he is willing to hide us. So all right. Actually it was four of us, yeah, this older guy, me and two other guys [indecipherable]. So, we accepted, what choice do you have, right? So we went -- he took us to his little farm and we went upstairs in his barn and we were hiding there. We were hiding for a few days and suddenly we hear guns, guns, guns, Russian guns getting closer and closer. We had food, we fed us potatoes, we\u2019re not hungry, had water and everything. And -- and then he came -- one evening he cames over and he said the Russians are next door in the next village, but they celebrating. So, d -- you know, how long are they gonna celebrate? But two days later they came, the Russians and the Romanians. First thing is a Romanian soldier I remember, first thing he did, he took my watch. So wa -- so I asked him, I says -- some -- somewhat we conversed, you know. I said, why are you taking my watch? He says, I have to give it to the Russians. [indecipherable] okay. The next Romanian took my shoes, which I didn't mind because it had nails from inside, you know? So he gave me his shoes. I think it was a good trade. Anyway, so then we -- no, says, well let\u2019s start an -- let\u2019s start walking. Walking the -- th-the aim, the goal was to reach his hometown in Hungary, which was probably hundred miles from there, roughly. So we\u2019re walking, maybe we get some rides. So we walked on the highway, see? And so the Russian Cossacks on horses on the highway, shooting apple off the trees, and all that. And then came a Russian -- Russian soldiers, you know, on -- on -- on trucks, they stopped, and they asked us, they said what -- who are you? Says, well we are, you know, we were in labor camps. Th-Th -- actually didn\u2019t know exactly what you are talking about, this -- they didn\u2019t know. What do they know? So it\u2019s -- one [indecipherable] ask who -- who -- where you from? I says, I am from Yugoslavia. He says, wh-wh-why aren\u2019t you fighting with the partisans? [indecipherable] going to explain it. But anyway -- and I spoke Russian, fortunately. That was another thing by the way, my f -- my -- my f -- older friend was smart too, he knew with me -- he was going need the Russian language. So he was not stupid. So I spoke Russian. Okay, so oh, oh, all right, fine, fine. And a Jewish officer, Russian officer came over and was talking to me, so, are you Jewish? I say yes. He says, okay, I am too, he says, but be quiet, don\u2019t tell the Russian soldier that I\u2019m -- they don\u2019t know that I am Jewish. Interesting. I don\u2019t recall now if that truck, or we -- I think we took a ride with them, they took us for a few miles, 20 - 30 - 40 miles, then we got off again. Well, eventually, in about two days, we got into his hometown. His wife was there, of course, his wife was a Gentile. He was also half Jewish like I was, I didn't mention that. His wife was Gentile, of course. And in his hometown, there\u2019s absolutely no sign or war. There was no sign of war, it was peace. Food like in the peacetime. Duck, geese, anything, it was just [indecipherable]. So we s -- I's -- the two guys and myself, we staying by their house, and we stayed with them, of course. The name of the city was Bekes-Gyula. It was about maybe 60 miles from Budapest --"

            "answer": "-- 60 - 70 miles from Budapest. We stayed there. I did not know at that time if my parents are okay -- they lived in Budapest, see? And I had a brother who was in Borr, Borr was a famous camp, you probably heard about it, the copper mines, you know, and they took from Hungary, these kids to Borr in \u201944. Later I -- somehow I found out through somebody who came from Budapest that my parents are alive, but my brother died, he was killed in Borr. He was murdered in Borr. Later, after the war, my cousin went to Borr by the way and recovered his body and brought his body back to Novi Sad, to my hometown, where he was buried. Now, the idea was to get to Budapest, but Budapest was not liberated yet, that time, well, they were still fighting for Budapest. And then I got a job as an interpreter with -- in a Russian h- hospital. The commander was Jewish, by the way. We became sort of friends."

            "question": "Ah.",
            "answer": "In Bekes-Gyula, and [indecipherable] of course, from Budapest gets liberated right away, we\u2019ll go to Budapest. Sure enough, we went to Budapest with him, with the Russian commander, and arrived in Budapest -- 1t was unbelievable, of course. People starving on the streets, coming over to the truck, begging for food, will give you anything. Gold rings, whatever you have, for a loaf of bread. Was pathetic. And the city looked, of course, terrible. It was just a day after liberation, still t -- heard shootings and everything. And now the idea was to find my parents. Well, I knew where they lived, see, because I lived in an apartment too, before I went to labor camp. So that was no problem to find them. So we -- we drove over there, with the truck. And my mother opened the door. She didn't know I was coming, of course, she opened the door, and she saw me, it was unbelievable, you know, like ah. She didn\u2019t know the circumstances. And then -- course we talked about my brother and everything, and they were in good shape, they were lucky, and then -- of course we invited -- the Russian commander stayed there 1n the apartment, he s -- he lived there. We -- I don\u2019t know how long I will stay, but I was very lucky. I remember one day in Budapest, I was walking down the street, and came these Russian soldiers, surrounded a whole block and took every man, every man from that block, they took into a backyard, into a big backyard, a schoolyard or something. I did not like the idea, I knew there is something wrong here, something is going to happen. So I said, I better work fast here. So I found a soldier in the group there, and I told him, hey, do me a favor. Go over to this place -- I gave him my mother\u2019s address -- find my commander, and tell him to come over here immediately, I need him. I was very, very lucky, cause the Russians were unreliable, very unreliable people. Big liars and unreliable. Now, first of all, he has to find the place. He\u2019s not a Hungarian, you know? I just give him an address. Then, he has to go, to begin with. And then he has- and then he has to find the commander in the house and bring him over here, because this is a matter of time now, right. He did go. He did bring the commander, and the commander came in. I told him what the story is -- well, he knew, so he talked to the commander in the yard and told him, this is -- I need this man, he is my interpreter. I need him, you have to release him. Okay, that\u2019s it. He saved me. I don\u2019t have to tell you what happened to the rest of the people. Russia. Took them to Russia. Many of them probably died. Matter of fact, not in that group, but I know my father\u2019s -- one of his good friends from Yugoslavia originally, who was in a German concentration camp, and who came back liberated from ra -- from Germany, was caught in one of these Russian affairs, you know, taken to Russia and died in Russia. Terrible. I --"

            "answer": "Yeah, of course, that\u2019s why -- exactly, that\u2019s why how could -- she could stay because she was Gentile, and she lived in this apartment house, and the -- the land -- not the landlord, the -- the -- ha -- the keep -- not e -- the manager of the house was also, of course, Gentile and he told the soldiers when the soldiers came a few times, who are these people, he said, this is Mrs. Loen -- Lowenberg at that time, of course, and she\u2019s a Gentile person, you know, she was [indecipherable] the name, her father was actually German, the mother was Hungarian. Of course, my mother did convert, you know, but they didn\u2019t know that, originally. And then she had the opportunity to save a lot of Jewish people from this apartment house. They were moved, before, to another apartment house, downtown Budapest and my mother used to take food there. Yeah, she ta-take them -- took them food, let her in, you know, and one time one of the guards I think was objecting and so forth, and what she said, you have to let me in because these people owe me money. Something like that, you know, sh- she\u2019s smart. And -- and she has -- I don\u2019t know if Masha mentioned it to you 1n j -- in Jerusalem she has a plaque, you know, and sh -- okay."

            "answer": "Okay. So anyway -- so then, a wa -- as I say, I was lucky, he saved me. Then I went back to -- I was going back and forth from this Bekes-Gyula, you know, where I lived with my friend, because th -- I lived there, actually. I didn't move right away back to Budapest. And we used to do some funny business, we went to Romania from Hungary and smuggled certain things. Like one time we smuggled a carload of sugar, and the Romanians mixed it with salt, so we had to throw the whole thing -- that reminded me, Stalin -- Stalin said once, he says, Romanians are not a nation, they\u2019re a profession. It\u2019s true. Was very, very disgusting, but what can you do? Amazing. I told the story the other day to a Romanian guy about the sugar, so he said right away, they mixed it with salt, didn\u2019t they? So he knew. This was now, in 1999. See, a Romanian. Takes a Romanian to know. But my friend, by the way, where I lived in -- in -- interestingly enough, I remember he had a brother who lived in London, who went to London before the war, and he was on the British Broadcasting Corporation, yes? His name was Haytai. I don\u2019t know what happened to him. I don\u2019t know what happened to the brother. I know one thing, the brother where we lived, it was very nice, and the wife was nice, but they were constantly fighting, which made it sort of unpleasant sometimes, you know, to live and stay and eat in a place where the -- th-the host and the hostess constantly fight. The reason I don\u2019t know. But anyway, he was too much in business, he was a businessman and preoccupied with business, and I think that\u2019s what she objected to. She was fairly young woman yet, you know, the man comes back after, you know, so many years from a labor camp and then he -- 99 percent he spends in business, you know, and one percent with the wife. But then -- then eventually, of course, we split because I did go back to Budapest and -- and stayed with my parents. Now the goal at that time was eventually to go to America where my older brother -- Masha, I\u2019m sure mentioned it to you, Ernest le -- came in 1938, he stayed here. So we have to get somehow out here, and -- and the parents were working on it, too, but I had to leave, somehow, Hungary and go to Austria, sort of the bridge, then from Austria to America. So I had [indecipherable] first to cross the border. Couldn\u2019t go it legally. So at night, with one of my good friends who was with me in the labor camp, he was -- by the way, I don\u2019t know if I mentioned it before, that a lot of the guys were killed from -- on that train when we left -- oh, I didn\u2019t say that, yeah, where he pulled me away from the train and the train went on, lot of these kids were -- lot of them were murdered later in Czechoslovakia."

But this -- this guy -- this -- this kid who le-left Hungary with me to Austria, Segeti Pauli was my best friend. He also escaped the train, the same train, a few stations later. So whoever escaped [indecipherable] well, anyway, so at night we crossed the border, paid a few forints, or whatever, panguat, I don\u2019t remember the currency, and we crossed the border and came to Austria. So then we went to Vienna first and then [indecipherable] I was to get to a displaced camp, and we knew about two displaced camps in Linz, Linz on the Danube. It\u2019s between Salzburg and Vienna, about halfway. And so we went to this -- that was easy when you get to a displaced camp, right away you register, you know. First we went to Lakeside, which was pretty lousy conditions, but then we went to Bindermichl. Now Bindermichl was like a -- a Hilton in comparison with Lakeside, right? And got a nice room, kitchen facilities. So -- he was married, by the way, my friend, married. And so we stayed there, he and his wife and myself."

Food three times a day. I me -- not weinerschnitzel, you understand, but beans -- bean soup, a -- but food. Coffee, everything. No problem. The commander was a lieutenant, nice guy, alcoholic, was drinking, you know? And just did what he had to do. Were never any beatings, were never any threatening. Matter of fact, we didn\u2019t know at that time what was really going on, except once, where in the very beginning for instance, on weekends, I used to go back to Budapest, to my parents on weekends, it was so easy. And then we stopped at one station and there comes a train from Budapest, with people, you know, they were taking them to Poland in cattle cars. People just crying for water. So what\u2019s going on? This was the first time that we realized that something -- something is going on, you see? And -- but we couldn\u2019t get close to the train, they didn\u2019t let us close. But as I say, it was -- a lot of half Jews were killed and murdered in Auschwitz, you know, I was just lucky that we stayed there and nobody bothered to -- to -- you know, to take us anywhere. So we stayed -- a mat -- fr-from that place, by the way, then we moved, a few months later, to another place that was in Romania, Gerdameshtahausa, also we were lucky, also circumstances normal, we were burying Hungarian soldiers, they brought them from Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Russia, you know, and they\u2019re burying them, I remember it was one of the tasks we did. And in the f-first place, we were -- we did -- we build railroad tracks, you know, and unloaded railroad cars, you see. And then I remember one day German troops came, and I st -- I -- speaking German of course, so I spoke to one of the Germans and they said -- he says, today the invasion started, he told me, it\u2019s a very good feeling. And I say, oh really, bah bah and da da da. But as I say, we were lucky, you know, it was luck. Many, many times it was really luck, lucky circumstances that nothing really happened. Th --"

Some guys made a lot of money. But any -- one day I was walking down, oh, you know, in -- in the camp itself, and I saw this girl. Masha, yeah. It\u2019s a beautiful girl. Said, where did she come from? She was absolutely stunning. So it\u2019s ju- un-unbelievable how beautiful she is. So we started talking, you know, da da da da da da, talking, talking, talking, and then started going together, I invited her [indecipherable] to a concert, she says, what\u2019s a concert, you know, she\u2019d never been to a concert.

Later on, of course, he became a management consultant and he was actually doing good jobs, you know, for many, many companies. But on his own, he could -- he would never succeed as a businessman.

I didn't stay there too long, I believe maybe two -- two, three weeks, four weeks at tops. That same time Masha had a job downtown in a factory, she probably told you, yeah. Then after I left the motel -- trying to remember now, recollect here, what was my next job? Oh yeah, my brother had the neighbor in Burbank, he -- and this 1s a German guy, Erb, Max Erb, he had a downtown Los Angeles -- scientific instruments he used to sell, import from Germany, Zeiss, you know, and microscopes, and sell and rent to USC and UCLA, see?

You know, o-opening new accounts for the milk company. Tho -- time -- it\u2019s still business, but tho -- those time- those days, I mean, it was big business, this home delivery business. And it was a fairly good job, and that was a union job. That was the first time I joined the union, which was good, because I belonged to the union all my life. I worked there, it was an easy job, I met a few nice guys who helped me with opening accounts, you know, because they knew a lot of people on the street. That made it a lot easier, cause you get -- you worked on commission. Was -- was a -- basically was a salary, a basic salary, which was not too much, and then whenever you opened an account, of course, you got commission for the account. So -- so Masha and I then -- we lived, as I say, we moved from L.A., from my parents and we had this nice little apartment, which Masha fixed up very nicely. And we had a nice life."

We -- we had fr -- [indecipherable] friends, for instance, our first friends was a dentist who was recommended by my landlord to my mother, who lived down on Clark Street, in West Hollywood. And Bestley was his name, and we met them, and eventually we became very, very good friends. They became our first friends in America, American Jews. Bestley and his wife, and of course they had a family already, they have kids and they lived in Beverlywood, and oh, he had a big job with Masha\u2019s teeth, you know, Masha had a big problem, you know, after the concentration camp, and -- but as I say, we became very good friends, we went to movies together and everything. And we [indecipherable] talked about is why don\u2019t you start a family, why don\u2019t you start a family? I says, ah, we got time, we got time for we get better situated and a bit more money.

We moved to the valley, to a very nice apartment on Deacon Street, where we had a crazy landlady who drove us nuts with keep the carpets clean, keep this clean, keep that clean, you know? So we couldn\u2019t stand it, so we stayed there about two months, and we moved out -- same street. We moved to an apartment which this young couple owned, very nice young couple who also became our friends, eventually. And then I -- just about in 1954, I remember I changed jobs again, I joined this company. I- it was a confectionary company, wholesale. They were making a famous Baker Boy confection roll, was a cinnamon roll, you know, but very -- very -- already established in Los Angeles area, and they needed some more salesman and I am -- introduced myself, da da da da.

I told my wife to take a look. I mean, this is -- this 1s ma -- like my father\u2019s brother. And then I asked the man where he was born, and he said he\u2019s -- he\u2019s from Vestva and that\u2019s a part of Germany, and as it happens, my father\u2019s grandfather came from Vestva, so he could have been a relative. But he was not a nice guy, he was not a nice lawyer. Very unfriendly, very uncooperative, and as I say, he was very negative. So I said to my wife, you know, wasting time here, nothing we can do. But there was another lawyer also who told me that there\u2019s nothing he can do with Yugoslavia. Nothing he can do with Yugoslavia. And now lately, there were stories that if you were in a Hungarian camp, a Hungarian labor camp, that you are eligible for certain compensation from the Hungarian government. So I wrote a letter, I wrote a letter and no answer yet. But somebody told me -- somebody told me, a Hungarian woman, she says, all you can expect from the Hungarians, if you -- you do get something, being in the labor camp, some money, but you\u2019re not going to get the money, the money is going to stay in Hungary, and you have to go to Hungary and spend the money there. Nice, huh? And, again, it\u2019s only a nominal fee, she says, nothing, nothing to get excited about. Well, that is her opinion, but I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m still expecting an answer from a -- I think Chicago 1s the lawyer. [indecipherable] even happens if -- well, sure I should get some compensation, being in a camp. It was a labor camp, it was a slave labor camp, you know? I-I didn't go there voluntarily, best years of my life. Spent there, how many times [indecipherable] about two years. I have pictures also, I have photos from the camp, which 1s unusual, a lot of people don\u2019t, of course, you know, yeah, but I was in the camp there with the commander, with the sergeant and the whole thing, the whole group of people.

I told you in the beginning she was the most beautiful girl, she still 1s. She\u2019s very nice to me, and she - we have a beautiful son who presently lives in Las Vegas and calls every day. Very- very devoted, very devoted son, very, very nice kid. Very unusual. You hear stories, you know, from people where their children are just a -- forgot their parents, and bad relationships, and to have a son like him is -- 1s -- it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a jewel, a present, really. But the way we brought him up I think is a lot to do with it. The bringing up, you know? Always close to him, always nice to him and that\u2019s why he\u2019s nice to us. He really likes us, you know? Comes twice a year, three times a year from Vegas on vacation. He\u2019s coming in a few weeks before Masha\u2019s birthday, already happy about it."
