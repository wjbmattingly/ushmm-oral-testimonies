I thought that we could start by just telling us something about your earl y childhood, where you were born, where you grew up.",
            "answer": "Well, I was born in Riga, which at the time of my birth, which is 1912, was still Russia. It is today an independent country, Latvia . I don\u2122t remember Riga at all because my parents moved to Kiev, which then was also Russia, became later Ukraine, when I was about one year old. Av \u0152 we\u2122ll th \u0152 Kiev I remember very well. We lived at a beautiful home, and a big courtyard, and it was a \u0152 a \u0152 a sizable apartment. When \u0152 in 1917, when the revolution broke out, and the \u0152 the communists were \u0152 how should I say \u0152 assi gning free rooms and apartments to their members, my parents decided to rent thei r apartment themselves. And there was an Italian lady who was a harpist in the Russian opera house, and her little girl \u0152 her little daughter was my playmate. And I have very good seven years from that time. The theater gave sometimes operas for children, like Sad Sultan , or The Cock Door, and The Golden Cockerel. And through this, the mother of my little friend Annata (ph), we sometimes got seats to go and see these operas. In addition, she was getting ballet dances \u0152 lessons, and so I got them myself also; my parents 4 thought it would be a good idea. It was a wonderful time for me as a child. For my parents it was much more difficult because there were shortages of all kinds. My father was arrested once for no reason except that he was a capitalist. And fortunately he was released twice when he was arrested. But in the meantime, there was, for instance, no water. And my mother had sometimes to go in the middle of the night when it was announced that there was some water somewhere in another quarter. And she would carry \u0152 come home carrying two pails of water for \u0152 for food and for washing. I was not aware of all these hardships. But after he \u0152 my father was released for the second time from prison, he said, no more, I want out. I won\u2122t stay."

That\u2122s why he was \u0152 we were able to leave the country legally. He could take his family, and take belongings necessary for a two year stay. However, the trip was most unusual. We were traveling in a train with cattle cars. We were sitting on the floor. We were part of a group of, if I recall, three or four families, which little \u0152 we all had little stoves, kerosene little stoves. The train would stop every once in awhile in the middle of the field that \u0152 that was \u0152 that \u0152 [break]"

            "answer": "The rail car was a cattle car, there were no seats. We were sitting on the floor, on hay, or whatever it was. And it was very primitive. The tri \u0152 the trip must have taken at least a week, if not more. And it would stop \u0152 the train would stop in the middle of the field, and we were all \u0152 were sucha \u0152 su \u0152 you know, supposed to get out to refresh ourselves with the snow, it was in winter, in January. We had little kerosene stoves. We made water out of the snow for tea. Everybody had, apparently, food with us. I don\u2122t have any recollection of being \u0152 of famine. But it was extremely primitive and I thought it the most exciting adventure you can think of. So, all my recollections of that time, which for \u0152 for adults were very taxing, for me were great fun. In Riga we had family. My mother \u0152 my mother\u2122s uncle was a psychiatrist who had a mental institution, which was the institution of the city. And \u0152 but we were not permitted \u0152 I mean, we \u0152 I speak of me as a child \u0152 to even go near it. The house where the family lived was in a big \u0152 how should I say it \u0152 estate, completely separated, and that was where the family lived. Couldn\u2122t see it at the institution, even though the \u0152 the windows. And then again, there was one of the women who was helping in th e household, had a daughter Ludiczka (ph). And Ludiczka(ph) was my playmate, again I had one friend, I never missed friends. So, I had a wonderful time. We stayed there until spring, and after \u0152 after that, my \u0152 my uncle on my father\u2122s side, had in Finland \u0152 also, he was a wealthy man, had a big estate in Finland , and the whole family of the Hessens(ph), which is my maiden name, were reunited there on the \u0152 on the fa rm. There there were chickens and two 6 horses. I was sometimes permitted to go on the chariot with the \u0152 with the horseman to bring somebody to the train station thro ugh the woods. It was wonderful. There was a lake, and one of my cousins was a little older than I was, and he was my playmate, and we went fishing in th e lake and canoeing, and so forth."

My mother and I went \u0152 stayed in Berlin, because first we \u0152 the whole family went to Berlin and my father left. And my mother and I stayed. We had rented a room in the apartment of a theater critic. And he always \u0152 his wife was not in good health, and he used to always to take my mother to first shows in the theaters in Berlin, which at the time, in the 20s at that time, was in full swing. And I was attended \u0152 was in \u0152 registered for the first time in my life to a school, because until then I was home tutored, both in Russia and in \u0152 in Riga, always I had home tutors."

For the first deception for me was when we left Berlin and joined my father in dan \u0152 in Sopot, which is a little town, a sea resort actually, attendant to Danzig . It is the distance like from Alexandria, Virginia to Washington, D.C. It is just attendant, but it is on the North Sea and a \u0152 a sea resort by the next \u0152 Poland, which is practically next door. So, dur ing the summer season it was invaded by the Polish [indecipherable] community which came to play in the cansino (ph) and so forth. But I went to a German lyc\u00e9e, which was a good school, but I hated it, because after the Russian school, which was on a very high level, the faculty was the cream cup of faculty from Russia , \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Russia, whereas here there were \u0152 how should I define it? Only women, only old spinsters, anti-Semitic, unfriendly. Very resenting the \u0152 the \u0152 the additions that came, and made probably their job difficult, because my German was practically nil. And my marks at the beginning were awful. I didn\u2122t learn German grammar, it was terrible. I had to write a composition, it was full of mistakes. It took me time."

So here was the train leaving with my newly wedded husband, and the ship leaving the next day. I didn\u2122t \u0152 I don\u2122t remember crying, but I must have been because later I realized that my cheeks were wet. And the same official came and said, don\u2122t cry. Let him go.
