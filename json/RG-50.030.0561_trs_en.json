            "question": "This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Vera Glasberg, conducted today by Judy Cohen, on January 7\", 2009, in the home of Mrs. Glasberg in Alexandria, Virginia. I thought that we could start by just telling us something about your early childhood, where you were born, where you grew up.",
            "answer": "Well, I was born in Riga, which at the time of my birth, which is 1912, was still Russia. It 1s today an independent country, Latvia. I don\u2019t remember Riga at all because my parents moved to Kiev, which then was also Russia, became later Ukraine, when I was about one year old. Av \u2014 we\u2019ll th \u2014 Kiev I remember very well. We lived at a beautiful home, and a big courtyard, and it was a \u2014 a \u2014 a sizable apartment. When \u2014 in 1917, when the revolution broke out, and the \u2014 the communists were \u2014 how should I say \u2014 assigning free rooms and apartments to their members, my parents decided to rent their apartment themselves. And there was an Italian lady who was a harpist in the Russian opera house, and her little girl \u2014 her little daughter was my playmate. And I have very good seven years from that time. The theater gave sometimes operas for children, like Sad Sultan, or The Cock Door, and The Golden Cockerel. And through this, the mother of my little friend Annata(ph), we sometimes got seats to go and see these operas. In addition, she was getting ballet dances \u2014 lessons, and so I got them myself also; my parents thought it would be a good idea. It was a wonderful time for me as a child. For my parents it was much more difficult because there were shortages of all kinds. My father was arrested once for no reason except that he was a capitalist. And fortunately he was released twice when he was arrested. But in the meantime, there was, for instance, no water. And my mother had sometimes to go in the middle of the night when it was announced that there was some water somewhere in another quarter. And she would carry \u2014 come home carrying two pails of water for \u2014 for food and for washing. I was not aware of all these hardships. But after he \u2014 my father was released for the second time from prison, he said, no more, I want out. I won't stay."

            "answer": "Well, that\u2019s where he got a \u2014 and a-\u2014 kind of a \u2014 edificial assignment to go for a job which was a \u2014 a fake job, to Riga for two years. That\u2019s why he was \u2014 we were able to leave the country legally. He could take his family, and take belongings necessary for a two year stay. However, the trip was most unusual. We were traveling in a train with cattle cars. We were sitting on the floor. We were part of a group of, if I recall, three or four families, which little \u2014 we all had little stoves, kerosene little stoves. The train would stop every once 1n awhile in the middle of the field that \u2014 that was \u2014 that \u2014 [break]"

            "question": "Okay, let\u2019s continue. So, tell me about the car, the rail car that you went to.",
            "answer": "The rail car was a cattle car, there were no seats. We were sitting on the floor, on hay, or whatever it was. And it was very primitive. The tri \u2014 the trip must have taken at least a week, if not more. And it would stop \u2014 the train would stop in the middle of the field, and we were all \u2014 were sucha \u2014 su \u2014 you know, supposed to get out to refresh ourselves with the snow, it was in winter, in January. We had little kerosene stoves. We made water out of the snow for tea. Everybody had, apparently, food with us. I don\u2019t have any recollection of being \u2014 of famine. But it was extremely primitive and I thought it the most exciting adventure you can think of. So, all my recollections of that time, which for \u2014 for adults were very taxing, for me were great fun. In Riga we had family. My mother \u2014 my mother\u2019s uncle was a psychiatrist who had a mental institution, which was the institution of the city. And \u2014 but we were not permitted \u2014 I mean, we \u2014 I speak of me as a child \u2014 to even go near it. The house where the family lived was in a big \u2014 how should I say it \u2014 estate, completely separated, and that was where the family lived. Couldn\u2019t see it at the institution, even though the \u2014 the windows. And then again, there was one of the women who was helping in the household, had a daughter Ludiczka(ph). And Ludiczka(ph) was my playmate, again I had one friend, I never missed friends. So, I had a wonderful time. We stayed there until spring, and after \u2014 after that, my \u2014 my uncle on my father\u2019s side, had in Finland \u2014 also, he was a wealthy man, had a big estate in Finland, and the whole family of the Hessens(ph), which is my maiden name, were reunited there on the \u2014 on the farm. There there were chickens and two horses. I was sometimes permitted to go on the chariot with the \u2014 with the horseman to bring somebody to the train station through the woods. It was wonderful. There was a lake, and one of my cousins was a little older than I was, and he was my playmate, and we went fishing in the lake and canoeing, and so forth."

And then my father went to Danzig where the same brother had the insurance company of the fleet on the Volga. You see the \u2014 it was the \u2014 well, see family and my father directed the office in Danzig. My mother and I went \u2014 stayed in Berlin, because first we \u2014 the whole family went to Berlin and my father left. And my mother and I stayed. We had rented a room in the apartment of a theater critic. And he always \u2014 his wife was not in good health, and he used to always to take my mother to first shows in the theaters in Berlin, which at the time, in the 20s at that time, was in full swing. And I was attended \u2014 was in \u2014 registered for the first time in my life to a school, because until then I was home tutored, both in Russia and in \u2014 in Riga, always I had home tutors."

For the first deception for me was when we left Berlin and joined my father in dan \u2014 in Sopot, which 1s a little town, a sea resort actually, attendant to Danzig. It is the distance like from Alexandria, Virginia to Washington, D.C. It is just attendant, but it is on the North Sea and a \u2014 a sea resort by the next \u2014 Poland, which 1s practically next door. So, during the summer season it was invaded by the Polish [indecipherable] community which came to play in the cansino(ph) and so forth. But I went to a German lyc\u00e9e, which was a good school, but I hated it, because after the Russian school, which was on a very high level, the faculty was the cream cup of faculty from Russia, \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Russia, whereas here there were \u2014 how should I define it? Only women, only old spinsters, anti-Semitic, unfriendly. Very resenting the \u2014 the \u2014 the additions that came, and made probably their job difficult, because my German was practically nil. And my marks at the beginning were awful. I didn\u2019t learn German grammar, it was terrible. I had to write a composition, it was full of mistakes. It took me time."

Very soon after my father arrived there, maybe a year, the \u2014 the \u2014 the garage with the used car collapsed.

By that time it was summer, and one luxury that my mother permitted herself, was to once a year to go to Riga to visit her mother. So while she was away, it so happened that the t-touring club of Belgium, which is like the ma \u2014 automobile association here, was looking for somebody for a member of their staff.

For me it was all a very easy going \u2014 so, what I was going to say that the big expense that we have made the \u2014 before May 10\", maybe before the one May fifth, is to buy a\u2014I cannot say a refrigerator because it was not electric. It was a cold box, you know, with pieces of ice. And here if the war breaks out, the day when that ice thing was delivered.

Whether you have means or not, take what you can carry and leave. Take the first train and go south. Go to Paris and see what you can do later.
