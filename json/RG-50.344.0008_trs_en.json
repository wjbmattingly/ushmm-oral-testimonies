And that was supposed to be soothing. But it wasn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t soothing at all. Either that or a cold pack. They would wrap them in cold sheets and do that for hours. But -- it was very interesting. I mean, the things that people say -- I used to keep a journal of everything -- the things said. Now, one young man committed suicide by burning up everything he had ever written. He was a writer and that was his way of committing suicide. So he was in there.
