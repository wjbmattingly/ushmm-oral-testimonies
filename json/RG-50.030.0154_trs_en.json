I didn't like it and then I went for two years I studied Greek and Latin because I had to. I wanted to to study law. At that time in Holland, you had to have the gymnasium, which is high school, plus Greek and Latin.

            "answer": "Well, I think that the intellectual environment where I lived, the whole, uh, situation with Germany...most of us were quite aware of it. We were aware of the danger. We were afraid of what would happen, although no one of course expected what afterwards happened, but I must say that in, in, in my, my people with whom I, uh, talked and, and worked--they were absolutely aware of the bad situation in in Germany, the bad situation of the Jews and of course don't forget that in, in Amsterdam in the years from from '35 on, we had so many refugees, Jewish refugees from Germany and from Poland. We...1n Amsterdam you really were...you...you couldn't, uh, not, not notice it. It was there. The, the people lived there 1n the south, especially in the south of Amsterdam, and some of them stayed there. Some of them went to, to the States, part of them. One thing I, I always remember...you know, I'm, I'm, I'm interested in the theater. And even....as a, as a student I was interested in theater, and just before the war...ya, just before the war, many artists from the cabaret, from the state, from the film, fled to Holland and as I said, some, some went afterwards to the States, but some of them stayed here and I, I've seen all the big names of the...of the actors and the Cabaretiers from Berlin, in Amsterdam, which is...which I would never have seen in my life and 1t was unbelievable because they were really top people, and I remember that they had the theater where every fortnight they brought a new program. It was absolutely unbelievable!"

Well, mostly student friends, of course, and there was a organization, uh, which was called Eenheid Door Democratie, \"Unity by Democracy,\" and that was a, a all the parties or the political parties were, uh, represented there.

And, uh, we were sitting together in, in a...what do you call it? ...Not a restaurant, but, uh, a meeting place for students. And then he was called on the telephone and he was asked by his parents to come immediately home. They didn't say why. So he said, \"Well, I have to go home,\" and, and he left and went home. And, uh, when he came home he was arrested and taken. And that was the first group of young Jewish boys...1t was in'41 before the general, uh, pick-up of all the, all the, all the Jewish people, in '41, and they were all young, young people...young, uh, boys and they sent them to a camp somewhere north of Holland, just...they said a labor camp. But of course we all knew it was just a a transit camp, and no one has every heard of the whole group. I'm sure they had been sent to a concentration camp."

I mean, she was right to, to, to go out of the country. But at that moment, we felt very much that we were left alone. And in the beginning of the '40's, the Germans kept a very low profile.

They, they didn't immediately, uh, pass laws, for instance, that the Jews couldn't, uh, go into shops or couldn't go to the cinema or couldn't go by train. That came gradually during the years, so they they, they, they ...every month they made a new move towards the, the isolation of the Jews and of course that, that... think that the the...and of course we had the February thing, which you remember, was the strike which was absolutely an illogical strike about, about, about the Jews, and afterwards I think that from '42, from the summer of '42 when the real razzias started, then the feelings really went very high against the Germans."

I didn't ...I couldn't live under my own name because that was too dangerous.

They, they, they, they were, uh, trying to get, uh, children from the Creche\u201d and as they were living in, in Utrecht, it was fast. They always had to travel from Utrecht to Amsterdam. It's not so far, but anyway...they weren't living here, so they contacted us and they said, if, 1f, uh, we should collaborate...\" You, you look for the children in Amsterdam. You know the families,\" and because we didn't only have children from the Creche. We had children right from the, from the parents too of course and that goes mouth by mouth. I mean someone knew that we were taking care of children and, uh, they informed the parents and we got...contacted. It was not only the Creche. But they asked us and that's why, why we we started. They couldn't handle it. It was too much, and they asked us to, to uh, fetch the children from the Creche and fetch other children. So, sometimes we hided the children ourselves or we gave them to Utrecht organization--independent who, who had places, but in...let's say a year later we were completely independent and they had their own organization. We worked together but we, we looked for hiding place ourselves."

            "answer": "Uh, there were only two men, my partner and I, and all the others one were girls, and that was logical because, uh, we couldn't travel with children at our age. We were about twenty. And at that age, it was very suspicious to sit in a train with a child. I mean...of course as a Jew it was very dangerous, but in that, that period, all men about twenty years of age were very afraid to go by train because the, the Groen Politie,\u2019 the German police, trapped all the * Pieter Meerburg's group was known as the Amsterdam Students Group. \u00b0 War. * The day-care center, the place in Amsterdam where infants and children were brought and cared for while awaiting deportation. > Green Police, so named because of the color of their uniforms. time all kinds of young boys from my age and took them, and sent them to Germany for work, so it was already dangerous just to sit into a train. So that was one of the reasons why we had...the girls, they were never picked up. I mean they, they left the girls alone. So all the, all the transport of the children had to be done by, by the girls. Sometimes I went with them to get them, but that's, that's different. Then they were there and it was their child and what we...my partner and I did...we were looking...we went to Friesland, to the north, and looking for contacts, and to look for hiding places. We went to the south. We were organizers, you see, but the actual transport was done by the, by the girls."

Most of them were relatives or friends of these people. The Jewish Council had the responsibility for the Hollandse Schouwburg--the theater where the Jews were brought to be sent to the camp of Westerbork. They were assembled there. Now, in in the Jewish Council, in my opinion, there were two kinds of people. One people were just obeying all the orders of the Germans, trying to save their own lives as much possible, and another part which realized that being a member of the Jewish Council, they had to sabotage as much as possible and to, to use the the, the power they had, given them by the Germans, to, to free as many children and adults as they could. Well, it was with these people I worked. Not with Asscher and Cohen. And for instance, you know, Walter SiiBkind,\u2019 Felix Halverstad\u2019\u201d...they were Jews who worked for the Auswanderung'! or Ausstellung. That was a a part of the Jewish Council supervised by the Germans, by aus der Fiinten,'* and, uh, they were the right people. They were very brave, and they looked after...they sent their children to the Creche, and they took care that we...they asked us to take the children from the Creche. But at the same time they let a lot of adults free by, by falsifying papers and letting them suddenly out of the theatre. They, they they did marvelous work. They were absolutely fabulous, because in, in that position to do that, is is risking your neck every second."

            "answer": "Well, the narrowest escape I had was, uh, we had a contact in the head of the, the underground in Friesland. He was the big boss in Friesland, and I...he was...he was a very good friend of mine. My, my son 1s still called, is named after him, and he, uh...suddenly there was a very, uh, uh, someone was caught and he was, he was talking, and he knew too much. So the whole group in Friesland had to, to hide and had to change addresses and go out of Friesland because at first in fact, he knew everything, the man, and he, he betrayed the whole thing, so, so he went to, to Amersfoort, which is near Utrecht, and he let me know that he was there and he asked me to come. And I had an appointment with him in Amersfoort, on the street not in a house. And he said, \"Well, would you, I, I need a new persoonbewijjs, identity card.\" And he gave me his photo and he said, \"Uh, please take care of it, and give me a very good one.\" And of course we had our contacts in Amsterdam, people who were printing...who had original identity cards, but only for the top people in the Resistance. So I went there and I, I made his, uh...I got his new identity card, and I had, uh, a rendezvous with him at six o'clock on a certain day in, uh, in Amersfoort. Only, only on a address, but I was very, uh, upset about it because it was so...he was...he was the most man the Germans looked for in the whole country. So I had to be very careful. And I asked the girls whom I lived with at the time, \"Go with me and and take the identity card, because if I'm caught with that\"...I could have been caught just as, as a twenty-year old boy. That had nothing to do with my...and then I would have...then there would have been the possibility that the identity card would be lost and I would be sent to a concentration camp or something, but that was not the question. The question was I wanted him to have that identity card and I, I had the feeling that it was very dangerous, so I said to her, 'Take...you go with me and let's go together, and you, you carry the, the identity card.\" And just before the station, she broke the shoe...the, the, the lace of her shoe, and I was mad. And we missed the train because of that. Now what happened actually in Amersfoort was that at one o'clock the whole house was, uh, complete...completely circled...uh, how do you call it?... circled...by, by very, uh, well-armed German troops because he was so...that important, and, uh, they, they, they, uh, they rang the bell and they said he got...and the man who, who, who did it said, \"I have a message from Esme,\" which is one of the... which was a good way to, to, to go into the house. Because he didn't suspect anything at that moment. At that moment he, he came in and, uh, two minutes later he knew he was trapped. So he took...he tried to take his revolver and, uh...."

But the the the strange thing is that normally when, when things like that happened, the Germans stayed at the house for twenty-four hours at least, to see what, what people came and they were caught there. That, that happened all the time. That was the biggest risk you had, that you walked to an address where the Germans had arrested someone, where they were still staying to look who was, who was coming. Now the funny...you know, the funny...the strange thing 1s, that they left at six o'clock and I arrived at, let's say, seven because of the fact that I had missed my train, and then when I, when IJ, uh, rang the doorbell, she said, \"Get out!\" so I knew the whole thing was wrong. Well, that, that was just a lucky escape and, and you know, you never know how, why...if it hadn't been the lace of the shoe, I wouldn't have survived."

But we didn't know if they had discovered all, all the material, so then the same man from from Friesland, Krijn van den Helm, where I was just talking about...that was before he was killed... called him and said, What are we going to do? He's in...my partner Wouter's 1n jail and I'm afraid. I don't know what he had, what he had with him.\" And he [NB: Krijn] came immediately to Amsterdam, and he went to the university. And by time in '43 the Germans had a very strange law. All the students had to, uh, sign a loyal, uh, statement that they would be loyal to the German occu...occupation and German people or something like that, which was completely idiotic, because it was, it was a forced statement. But they they were very tough on that because they said, \"If you don't sign it, either you can't study on, and your parents, especially your father, is responsible,\" and a lot of students signed because they didn't want their father to be responsible for, uh, what, what, what they did. It didn't occur to us because we were not studying anymore in '43, so there were, uh, there were student cards of of people who had signed and I went with the...with Krijn van Helm to the university, and he went to the office where they they gave away this...where they had the, uh, this, this...what do you call it?...college identification card, and he threatened him that he would kill him if he didn't give him a book of these, uh, identity cards, and he gave them. He immediately gave them. So what we did, we, uh, put a photo of my partner on it. It was signed in his name, and his sister went to the jail and he was immediately freed. So that was a narrow escape, not for me personally but anyway for the whole group."

It was...and there was a man with a laundry, and I heard that the man had a lot of addresses for adults, but for children too. And he went...every Saturday he went to, to Amsterdam with a, with a truck and he came back in Joure with, let's say, twenty or thirty adults. And he hided them in different places, so I knew, and I wanted to talk to him, that he would give us addresses for children too. So I went with with one of the girls to, to Joure and we had two children with us which we wanted to hide, and he had agreed to, to, to, to help us, and okay...we arrived and we gave the children to him and he looked after them, but as it was already late, we couldn't go back to, to Amsterdam. It was...after twelve you're not allowed to, to be on the streets, so we couldn't make it with the train. So we had to stay there, so we got...we stayed there and we got a very decent meal. For us it was very important to get \"heel\" [NB: Dutch word for \"very\"| good food, and he was very nice. After...after... dinner, I sat with him and we talked and then he suddenly said, \"Yes.\" He told me that he hated the Jews on religious ground. They had killed Christians and by his faith, the Jews were his enemies. But, it is stated in the Bible, \"You have to love your enemies.\" So that's why he did everything to save them. Now if I am telling it just now...it looks like a wierd story but at that moment it was a terrible story because I didn't know. I wondered what he was doing...if he was betraying...a traitor and sending all the the adults to the Germans and the children too. I was absolutely frightened. I didn't sleep the whole night and neither did the girl. And we got out as soon as possible, and we went to, to, to the head of the resistance in Friesland, to Leeuwarden. And we said, My God, what do you know? Do you know that man? Is he all right?\" We informed him. And it turned out finally he was all right, and after the war I, I spoke to him. I said, \"Do you '> Famine or \"hongersnood.\" remember what you said to me? You have scared the hell out of me because of, of what?\" And he meant it. He meant it, absolutely! He said, \"Yes, but I, I...\" Afterwards, he said, \"I changed completely. I watched these Jews, the whole, uh, during the whole war and they are just like us, and I completely...it was a completely wrong belief.\""

There were always, uh, parents who wanted to, who who were hiding, who were not hid...hiding and who wanted to hide...it was very difficult to hide with your children so then they they contacted us and we took the child one or two, and, and, and took it away, so it's, it's not only the Creche. It's, it's...you took it right from the parents. That was one of the reasons why I think we could do the job, because we were young and it's, it's a...1f you think about it now, today, as a father or a grandfather, it was absolutely inhuman to, to, to separate the child from the parents, and I think we, we could do it because we were not parents ourselves.

It's very dangerous to, to, uh...because, I think, if you realize the danger...of course you know it...but 1f you realize, you think of it, you can't work anymore. I think you, you, you would stop. You, you, you, you push it back. You, you don't want to be...you know, and that was in our case, of course, a very important thing. The responsibility toward the children. If anything happened to us...i1f you got tortured, uh, you could, you could give addresses or you could...you never know. That's why we were very cautious with the...for instance, the parents never knew where a child was hidden. That was one one absolute rule we never changed. And sometimes, the parents found out where the children were hidden and we moved them away because it was too dangerous. Dangerous for the child, dangerous for the, for the parents. On the other hand, I didn't know all the addresses. I only knew part of the addresses. And we had three separate lists and only a few...all the lists, all the three lists were together, you could find the children, so I could never betray the children. Neither could the girls or my partner. And I think that was the most essential thing where we were afraid of--that something would happen...that you would betray, had to betray the children.... I mean, no one is a hero. With torture you can can...you never...you, you can't blame someone being tortured...betraying. There was a rule in, 1n the resistance that if someone was caught, within twenty-four hours, you had to, to, to, to, uh...not to say anything, betray anything within twenty-four hours; and after twenty-four hours you were allowed to betray because then everyone who was connected with you would have changed the address.

They had a lot of casualties, because of that. We wanted to to have a very small but very first rule, our group, and the more people you, you took with you, the, the danger became much more."
