            "answer": "I -- well, I associated mostly with ref ugees, especially with je -- refugees from Czechoslovakia. I belonged to a organization called Young Czechoslovakia. And it -- there I met 2 many people who worked in the Czech government. Of course, I didn\u2122t have a chance of ever getting into the Czech government, but I met a young man who was a -- a private in the Czech army and one day my uncle asked me to take something to the Czech government, a document, to his friend, mis -- Dr. Schlesinger who worked th ere, who was a official there. And wi -- on the way to going to see Dr. Schlesinger I met this young soldier and he said to me, oh, what are you doing here? Are you working for the Czech government? I said no, no. I -- I don\u2122t know a minister -- any ministers yet. So -- because it was so difficult to get into it, I\u2122m -- just almost impossible. And he said, well come and see me at two o\u2122clock. And I went to see Dr. Schlesinger, my uncle\u2122s friend a nd I said, this man, I didn\u2122t even know his name, a-asked me to come and see him at two o\u2122clock. And he said we ll, if he told you to go and see him, go and see him. So I -- I asked him for his name and he told me what his name was. I described the gentleman to him, and then at two o\u2122clock I went to his office, and as I enter the office it said, Minister Meyer. I was completely stunned b ecause he was so young, and I had absolutely not expected that -- that he would be -- have a -- ha ve a position like that in the Czech government. In any case, he asked [indecipherable] -- should I put them here? And so I saw him and he aasked -- of course I was very surprised and he was surprised at my surprise, and he arranged for me to take a test. At that tim e however, I was working for a company that was important for the war effort and they [indecipherable] want to rele ase me, so for six months I was not released, but after six months I was -- the position was still held for me and that\u2122s how I got to work in the Czech government. But -- should I continue on that?"

            "answer": "Oh well, I -- the test was extremely compli cated. This mi -- Minister Meyer called up a colleague of his and asked me to -- asked him to give me a test. When I came to his office the 3 test consisted of -- he asked me to translate the \ufb01Financial Times\ufb02 from English to Czech. Course, I didn\u2122t understand a word of the \ufb01Financial Times\ufb02 in English, let alone in Czech. So I sat at the typewriter with the \ufb01Financial Times\ufb02 staring me in the face -- mind you, I was very young, of course, I didn\u2122t understand English very well, and of course eco-economics was beyond me. And I was terribly embarrassed and I di dn\u2122t know what to do and I decided the best thing to do is to just get up and go home, which I di d, and I left. At that time we -- my sister and I lived at the YWCA. And when I came home in the evening there was a message from Minister Meyer saying come back for another test. So I was really, really surprised. Obviously he was very a-a-anxious to help me to get into the gove rnment and he wanted me to have a job. So I came back for another test and this time he gave me a sheet of type -- typed material to copy type, which was, of course, very easy to do. And that was my second test and that\u2122s how I succeeded in getting into the government."

Of course I -- since I left Czechoslovakia, since I left the school system in Slovakia at the age of 13, my expertise in the language was very limited. But -- and so I\u2122m -- but I s uppose able to obvi -- obviously speak fluently and I was required in th e Czech government to write and to work in Czech. And I was brought up in the Slovak schools, so I still hadn\u2122t learned the Czech when I got into the government, but I managed to get thr ough. I don\u2122t know, one does the best one can and survives. And people were very ha -- friendly and -- and people helped. And so what I did was mostly Czech correspondence and also I did subtitles for films. I did the -- what do you call it? The little te -- the translations, you know, I typed those for Czech films, in Czech. And I did Czech and English correspondence. 4"

I lived in Sussex in the children\u2122s home for a year, then I went to school for another year.

Because first of all, we were really in a very -- let\u2122s say it wa s sort of like in a state of shock, let\u2122s put it that way. And we were sort of barely managing to ex ist anyway, because we were trying to make a living. We lived through the London blitz, we didn \u2122t -- I mean, we had to concentrate on survival, on surviving and we were terribly afraid of what\u2122s go -- what\u2122s going on in Europe. We heard terrible things but we didn\u2122t want to belie ve it because we were very frightened for our family. And we just lived from day to day and we were mostly together with refugees, other refugees. And of course we were just -- were not integrated into the British world. And what happened was that we lived, at first -- I mea n, I don\u2122t know exactly the dates, but I would -- I would be able to look them up becau se I kept all the papers, but we n -- at first we lived in a chur -- when we -- after -- after we left the ho -- childr en\u2122s home, we lived in another girls\u2122 home run by a ger -- German refugee woman. And we were four girls to a home and then we lived -- my sister and another friend and I lived in a room rented from another -- in a house from another refugee, a lady. And we socialized mostly with other refugees. In the evenings we got together with other refugees and we just talked about our s -- but we had some very good times together, too, we had good social evenings, we went to the theater. We went dancing, we had it -- we were very close together because we were all in the sa me boat. But we were not included in the life of the British, and especially not in Jewish community. I don\u2122t remember that we have ever been invited to a Jewish holiday, to a family. I don\u2122t th ink of -- I don\u2122t think so. I can\u2122t remember that we ever had a Seder in England, or anything like that. So we just sort of s-sat around waiting for 6 the end of the war because we thought we would -- we were very anxious for the war to end so that we could go home."

            "answer": "Well, hearing terrible thi ngs about what was going on in the [indecipherable] concentration camps. We weren\u2122t sure -- we di dn't know the extent of -- of th e things and we hoped -- and we always thought that our parents and af -- that our father would survive, because we thought -- he was very popular in the village and he was very important in th e me -- running of the village, actually, because he was very helpful with things like the -- he was friendly with the mayor and he was friendly with the local population. He helped whenever there was any kind of problem with the fire engines. He was into everything, actually in -- and he was very handy. He was a mechanic and [indecipherable] a farm, we had some farm animals and he was very friendly with the local population, so I thought people would protect him. So we were hoping that h -- we kept on saying that probably our parents would be okay, but still we worried terribly about our friends and about the rest of the family. Because my fathe r\u2122s family, the majority of the family lived in Poland, just across the border from where we were in Zakopane. We lived in a northern -- northern part of Slovakia, which is very close to the Polish border. And so we worried. And of course, during the war my father -- I mean, befo re the war, when Austria was occupied and Germany -- ther-there was trouble in Germany, my father used to walk refugees from those countries across the mountains to -- to Poland be cause they were escaping from Austria and from Germany. So we worried, of course, about Polan d, family in Poland. And of course, about our grandparents. Oh, and there was one other thing. My grandmother, who was -- lived in Zakopane, came to live with our parents, because when things got bad in Poland she came across 7 to Czechoslovakia and lived with our parents, and we knew that this was going to be extremely difficult for our parents because I knew that my father would never leave as -- as long as his mother was staying with him."

Well, it was completely -- well, first of all, we lived through the entire blitz in London, and I think I\u2122ve never been -- maybe once I went to a shelter. London was -- oh, we were just -- it was -- it devastated, was bombed, all of it, everywhere. It was -- we were very in -- limited in our ra tions, but everybody had a tremendous spirit and everything -- everybody worked and it -- and look -- was excited about the end of the war, of course, naturally. And there was great excitement that the war was over. Everybody was so hardworking and dedicated and they had business as usual everywhere, on every shop, no matter whether the bombs fell the day before. And we -- as far as we were concerned, we were thrilled with the war being over. We immediately cabled to our village to find out about our parents. We ran to all the places where Red Cross posted lists of people who were -- we found out about the camps at that point and we went, looked to see whether we could see the names of our parents or our friends or our families. And we found the par - names of our parents on lists that went to Auschwitz [indecipherable] and -- and from what poi nt that was. And we just hoped it -- just hoped that they would be alive. But we sent the cable to the teacher that wa -- lived in our house and we -- and to another friend, and we got a cable back saying that our parents were sent to Poland in the summer of \u212242 and they had not returned. And I have several of these cables from different sources. One from the district bil -- buil ding in the village, one from our teacher, who lived in the house. And then also somebody wrote, maybe he did, that our father was taken to Auschwitz and that somebody went to visit him, but when they came to -- when they went to -- I 11 could never understand that because he wrote to sa y that someone went to see my father and took some clothes to him in Auschwitz, and that when they got there they found that my father and some other men escaped, but that they were cap tured. But we would never find out any furth -- more about that. And we can\u2122t find the document, we looked for it. We can\u2122t find the document where he wrote this [indecipherable] so I don\u2122t know. But then we decided that my sister, older sister would go back to -- to the village, almost immediately to find -- to see, and wait to see whether he would returned. Now that\u2122s one thing which is absolutely unbelie -- I still cannot get -- believe that I didn\u2122t go along with her, because I-I think we -- we were too afraid. I was too afraid to go back and -- but I wish I wouldn\u2122t have been. I wi sh I would have gone with her because my older sister was only a year and a ha lf older than I was, but because she was asked by my parents to take responsibility for the two of us, she was of a more -- we expected her to be like a mother to us. And so we decided that sh e should go by herself. And b -- aside from the fact that we didn\u2122t have any kind of -- we didn\u2122t have any money to go to -- I mean, it was quite a problem to get the money together to send her to Czechoslovakia, or -- and she went by herself and found that no one came back."

            "answer": "Well I couldn't -- I kept on -- I stayed on with the government and it was -- the war ended in 1945. In 1947 I received a letter, I think -- no. Wait a minute, no, in 1947 was the annual meeting, second annual meeting of Internati onal Monetary Fund in London, in September 1947. And I -- see, right -- immediatel y after the war ended, most of the people who were working for the Czech government in exile went back, and the top officials went back to -- immediately went back to Czechoslovakia. I forgot, that\u2122s when you asked me what -- what happened immediately after the war. Well, they knew they couldn\u2122t wa it fast enough -- to get back to Czechoslovakia fast enough, so many of them, many of the peopl e I worked with and many of the people who belonged to the [indecipherable] Czechoslovakia at the time who were -- I was with a lot, immediately packed up and went back to Czechos lovakia. That was -- also included people like Madeline Albright\u2122s father and the family went back immediately after th e war. Many of these people were people that I knew very well because I worked with them. A nd -- but I didn\u2122t even think for a moment that I would go back. I mean, I was just allowed to stay, so we -- we go, and the exile continued in czecho -- in London and I worked for the mi nistry, same ministry with Minister Meyer. He was also one that went back immediately. And I -- so in \u212247, one of the people who went back, who was a good friend of mine, whose name was Latso Biele, I think he was a Jew, want -- cabled to the ministry in Lo ndon to say that I was to be assigned to work for 15 the International Monetary Fund conference. That\u2122s how -- that\u2122s how the whole thing evolved. And I was to be assigned to the -- the Czech delegation, which consists of 15 people, the governor of the bank of Czechoslovakia and the executive director for the bank of -- for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, a nd he cabled to my boss and said that I was to -- he didn\u2122t communicate with me at all. I was not in touch with him at all after he went back to Czechoslovakia, but he cabled and said that I was to be assigned to work with a co -- delegation coming to London from the Internat ional Monetary Fund. It was the second [indecipherable]. And I absolutely refused to go, because I said I couldn\u2122t do it because it was going to be a very high level delegation and it was a -- it was a huge annual meeting, and I was absolutely petrified. I honestly didn\u2122t think I was able to do this job. It was -- and he wouldn\u2122t take no for an answer. I mean, not to me, I -- as I said, I had never been in touch but directly to my superiors. And he said I have to do it. And I said no, I couldn\u2122t do it, I just couldn\u2122t. I was too inexperienced and I was too young and I was too afraid of it. And I said, no I couldn\u2122t. And they said yes, you will have to do it. So I was assigne d to work with them, and I went to work with them. There are 15 of them here in London, and it worked out very well, of course. I mean, there are -- it was very good. In fact, one of them said to me, don\u2122t -- why -- would you like to come and work in Washington? And I said -- I didn' t know much about the In ternational Monetary Fund, nor did I know anything about the World Bank and I asked him which organization I should apply for and he told me well, he liked the International Monetary Fund better. And so I was sent for a test, and I didn\u2122t take it seriously, I thought I would take a test just to see how I would do, for my own benefit. And I took the test and I just forgot completely about the whole thing, never thought about it again. I never expected that I would be offered this job. But then, in March 1948, when the communists took over Czechoslovakia, I came to the office one day and 16 on my desk was a letter recalling me back to Pra gue. So all of us who were then working for the Czech government were asked to return to Pr ague immediately by the communist government. As soon as I opened the letter, I said, that\u2122s the end of my career w ith the international -- with the Czech government, because I wasn\u2122t going to go b ack to Czechoslovakia, to the Czech -- under the communists. And I left -- I asked my boss that morning to -- whether I could go and take the morning off, and I took off and started -- went looking for another job. And I came back to the office late in the afternoon having found a new job. And when I got back there was a message from my sister to say that I ha ve a letter from International M onetary Fund. It was -- the whole thing happened the very same day. The Czech government recalled me back to Prague. I found a new job the same moment and in the afternoon I had the letter offering me an appointment with the International Monetary Fund. I was shock, abso lutely shock because I never expected to be hire by the International Monetary Fund in Wa shington, and I didn't r eally want to come, because I didn\u2122t want to -- by this time I ha d settled down in London quite comfortably. My sisters were there, my friends we re there and I wasn\u2122t going to go by myself to America to start a new job. And I just didn\u2122t want to do it. So I said, oh no, I can\u2122t believe that I got this job, I don\u2122t want it. But then I thought to my self, if I don\u2122t go -- if I don\u2122t go I\u2122ll never forgive myself, I have to try. And so I immediately cabled back to the managing director because they liked -- because since only high level people were hired from abro ad, not at my level, and a letter was signed by the managing director and I cabled back -- I cab led back to the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, appointment accepte d, which I laughed about for years afterwards, because I thought it was so funny. When I came to the fund I realized that it was a funny response on my part to a managing director to say appointment accepted. But in any case, I did accept appointment for the simple reason that I t hought we\u2122ve got to get on with our lives. If I 17 don\u2122t leave London my sister, my ol der sister will never get -- leave us, we\u2122ll all live together, she\u2122ll never marry and I have to break up the trio . So I decided to leave for America, but I only was going to leave for one year. And I\u2122m here still."

He was executive director and he thought that I should work for someone who was a Czech, because at the time Czechoslovakia was a member of the International Monetary Fund, which a -- it was just before the communists. After I arrived in America, Czechoslovakia withdrew from the International Monetary Fund, so we had to be a -- the executive board had to make a decision to allow us to continue to work, even though Czechoslovakia was no longer a member, and we were all Czech citizens.

            "answer": "The first time I went back was in 1968, I think. C ould have been a little earlier. We arrived in -- we planned to go back because at that time things seem to have eased up in Czechoslovakia and we decided that was the time to go. And it was very important for me to make my trip back 45 to Czechoslovakia, since I had never been back there. And we arrived in Vienna with plans to take a rent-a-car and drive to my village. When we got to [indecipherable] Peter and myself and our son, who was then seven or eight years old, when we arrived in Vienna I suddenly got cold feet and I didn't want to go. I said to Peter, no, let\u2122s forget about it, I don\u2122t want to go back. For several reasons. First of all, I was very afraid of going back for the first time. Secondly, I wasn\u2122t sure about the pol -- about the communist -- what was going -- you know, how it will be. And it was just really frightening to me to go back, but Peter said no, we came all this way, we are definitely going back -- we are definitely driving. So we rented a car and we drove to my village. We arrived in my village at six o\u2122clock in the ev ening. It was not recognizable, because it used to be a very charming little village in the lower Ta tras mountains and now it was sort of like a factory. A lot of cement buildings all around and di -- very dilapidated. And we arrived in the village at six o\u2122clock in the evening and I didn\u2122t know who to ask for and I didn\u2122t know exactly where -- where everything was, it seemed to be different. And when we arrived in ce-center of the village, I asked -- I decided to ask for my gir -- girlfriend, who used to be the mayor\u2122s daughter. Her name was Maria Bautiva She was my girlfriend, who was not Jewish. And so we stopped in the middle of the village and I said, do you know Maria Bautiva? And they -- I said, it\u2122s probably not her name any more, because it was her name when she was a little girl. She may -- she\u2122s probably married and -- but this person know -- knew who she was and she said, she died two years ago. I was so disappointed because I ha d not been in touch with her since 1939, but I felt she would be the only person I could think of that I remember. And so then we decided to go and look at -- at the house where we lived. And I couldn\u2122t recognize it, it was so run down. The entire street was so run down. And at first I didn\u2122t know where it was, and I said to him, let\u2122s go to the railway station, because from the railwa y station I know how to find the house. So we 46 went to the railway station, and walked down the street, when there was this hou -- what seemed to be our house, which my father finished building in 1938, it was brand new when we left it. We left in \u212239, my father finished building this house in \u212238. And there were some children playing outside. And said to the children, do you live in that house? And they said yes, we do, we -- three families live in the house. We live on the top floo r. I -- I said, go and ask you mother whether we could come in, because I used to live here. And so she went in, we came to the front of the house and the child went in and she ran upstairs and she said to her mother, somebody wants to come and look at the house. And the mother stood at the top of the stairs, she looked down at us. She knocked on the door of the husband\u2122s room where he was ta -- taking a nap, and she says to her husband, come down, Miss Eberstark arrives here. I was absolutely shocked, I said, how did you know who I was? She said, well who else could it be? Because I said I lived there, so she knew exactly in whose house she was living. That wa s 1939, this was 1968, 30 years later. And so we went up there and of course I looked -- and she said that two families lived downstairs [indecipherable] lived upstairs. And they -- and I couldn\u2122t find one stick of anything that belonged to my parents. There was nothing that was recognizable. And they immediately sent for other people to come in. And he was telling u - this man was apparently the same age as we were -- I-I was, and he said we used to play when we were children. And then he said, I remember your grandfather and he pointed to hi s [indecipherable] your grandfather always used to wear this gold watch with a big gold chain. And he made out as if the chain were four i -- three inches wide, which was a little gold chain, but to him that chain seemed to be a huge gold chain. In any case, it was -- then they insisted that we spend the night. Oh, another person was called, and they antic -- we were looking for a pl ace to stay for the night and this man insisted that we spend the night at his house, which was nice of him. We spend the night there and at 10 47 o\u2122clock in the morning I said to Peter, we\u2122ve got to get out of here, I can\u2122t stand being here. And we went to a Jewish -- the only thing we did was g-go to a Jewish cemetery and we -- oh, everywhere we went -- I mean that first ni ght, everybody wanted to buy our house. They said, could we buy your house from you? I said no, it\u2122s not my house any more. So they s -- and anyway, next morning we went to my grandfat her\u2122s house.

Then I said to Peter, we\u2122ve got to get out, I was feeling sick. So at 10 o\u2122clock in the morning -- oh, in the -- then we went to the woods, where we used to spend a lot of time with the family. And in the woods there was a big grave where they -- mass grave where they mu rdered some people. I always suspected that my grandfather was murdered there, but I coul d never find out, and that\u2122s one thing I did not 49 really find out who was -- the names are not on th e grave, so I don\u2122t know who is buried there. Then we saw -- met one Jew in the village who survived. His family -- I don\u2122t know what happened to his family, he didn\u2122t seem to be all with it, but he converted and became a Catholic and he\u2122s married to a Catholic woman. His name was Shaiman, I think. And at 10 o\u2122clock in the morning we pulled out and I sat in the back of the car, Peter and our son sat in the -- Peter was driving, our son sat next to him. I sat in the ba ck because I couldn\u2122t sit up, I had to lie down. I was sick all the way, all the way to Vienna. I was vomiting all the way to Vienna. I was so ill that when we arrived at the Czech border, Peter didn\u2122t see the patrol, the ca -- people trying to stop our car, he t -- almost drove right through it -- through the frontier. We were almost shot because Peter was in such state trying to get me b ack to Vienna because I was so ill. And then th -- [indecipherable] is dark and there was lanterns being installed [indecipherable] people were trying to stop him from driving past those lanterns. And he stopped and the guard said, what are you trying to do? You must stop at the frontier. And then h-he talked -- he saw me being very ill and he just opened our trunk, examined the trunk and let us go right through. We arrived in Vienna at -- at 11 o\u2122clock at night and I went straight to bed, it took me two or three days to recover. We stayed in Vienna and I just stayed in the hotel and tried to recover from my first visit to Czechoslovakia. But, that was a very, very im portant visit for my life, because that changed a lot for me in my life ca -- this visit, because for years and years, ever since I left home, I just felt like I was living from a suitcase, even though I was married and had children. I just felt that there was something not quite right and that I ha -- like I was waiting for something to happen. Well -- and I was sort of longing for Czechoslovakia and for my home. And having made this trip back, suddenly it dawned on me that -- because I was -- I always loved snowdrops and wild -- and the woods in Czechoslovakia, and having made the tr ip back, I came back home and I said, well, 50 snowdrops and wild strawberries are not everything. I -- and it sort of finished that chapter of my past. That was a very, very important time. When I came back from this trip, it really -- it did something for my entire being. It made me feel se ttled, more settled in my home. I felt this is where I belong and this is where I am and I stopped being so torn towards going home."

            "answer": "No, no. Then we made another -- one other trip -- well, I went back to Czechoslovakia again, to Prague, once. But then my -- my middle daughter came, who is a writer , a journalist, wanted to go back, which really surprised us. She wanted to go and visit my village. So we decided to make a trip back about four years ago. And it wa s a wonderful, wonderful experience. We stayed also a very short time, but it was wonderful for me to be able to take her, to show her where I was born, where my parents lived. And we di dn\u2122t go into the house this time, because nobody seemed to be there, but it was very run down. And -- but we just walked around. Of course, we went to the synagogue which is there, which is not a synagogue any longer, it\u2122s men\u2122s club or something. It used to be a grain storage after th e war, when we went back first time. Then we went to a Jewish cemetery. Somebody seems to be taking care of the tombstones. But one thing I did not do, which I still have to do one day when I go back, I didn\u2122t talk to anyone in the village. I just didn\u2122t feel like I could talk to anyone. And I should have done that, I should have gone to the office, to the -- what, a district building, whatever they call that, to find out who survived, who is there, who is Jewish. I didn\u2122t ask anyone. I just didn\u2122t talk to anybody, I didn\u2122t feel that I wanted to. But we wandered around the village, we went to the -- passed the synagogue, everybody was staring at us because we were looking up and down where the synagogue stood. Then we asked the taxi driver to drive us to the Jewish cemetery. We went and took photos and movies of the Jewish cemetery. Then we went to stop at the schools to which I went, and my 51 daughter just adored it all and thought it was marvel ous to have been -- made the trip. Now we have to take the -- my oldest daughter."

            "question": "Is there anything that we have not discussed that you still want to talk about?",
            "answer": "I think we\u2122ve covered more or less everything except, let\u2122s see -- well, I think -- I can\u2122t think of -- probably after we finish I\u2122ll think of lots of other things that I haven\u2122t said, because that happened when I did the original tape. After it was done, I thought of many things that I should have mentioned. Mm, well, yes, there are severa l things that I haven\u2122t mentioned. I haven\u2122t mentioned my uncle, who was instrumental in br inging us out. My uncle, who was my mother\u2122s youngest brother, who lived in lon -- London. First he lived in Berlin and so he knew what was going on and then he lived in London and he\u2122s the one who made the arrangements for us to -- to come out. Now, it was absolutely a miracle that we came out because we lived in a small village in the Tatra mountains, where no one would have ever imagined that anything would happen to us. And we always thought, during the war, that nothing would happen to my parents because we 52 thought our friends, our neighbors would take care of them. But we were wrong. Now, if it hadn\u2122t been for my uncle and his wife, Lotte, we would -- who urged our parents, if it hadn\u2122t been for my brave parents who took it upon them selves to put three children on a train -- my God, when I think about it -- and to give up the children and to send them away, and if hadn\u2122t been for Nicholas Winton, and if it had -- hadn\u2122t been for my guardian who signed for me, and if it hadn\u2122t been for Marda Hess who signed for my ol dest sister and my you ngest sister, we would never have made it. And also I want to say that -- that if I had to say anything critical about it, is that nobody paid attention to our education. I must say that, because in London my older sister was left totally without schooling. She was 15 years old and nobody thought of sending her to school. And is -- I think that is absolutely awful, that is, when I think about it. And with me it was a miracle that my guardian -- I mean, my uncle persuaded my guardian to send me to secretarial school. That was a big argument, she didn't want to do it because she kept on saying that she only was required to sign, not to do a -- do anything because she -- he promised her that she wouldn\u2122t have to do anything but sign for me . And now he was asking her to send me to school, and I had to finish my schooling in 10 months where other children went to that particular school for three years to get the -- or two years, or three years to get the schooling. I had to do it in 10 months, which was not -- no t good because I didn\u2122t speak English. I had to learn to speak -- take shorthand, it was very difficult. But that is really a shame that no one really paid much attention, I guess. Everybody was so stressed and preoccupied and under such difficulties that nobody thought about it. I mean -- I don\u2122t know. It seems to me that they could have seen to it that my older sister had some scho oling, and that I was sent to a better school than I did -- was, but still, we -- we\u2122re grateful that we survived and we are grateful that all of these 53 people participated, my uncle, the guardians, my parents, Nicholas Winton, who else? A-And everybody. It worked for -- for us."

You know, she just signed for me. She felt that -- she was -- happened to be a friend of my uncle\u2122s, so sh -- but -- that\u2122s why she signed. But she -- although she could have afford ed to do a lot of things, she just didn\u2122t know how to deal with it. Didn\u2122t do anything.

And then one day she got really angry with me. She said -- she blamed me. She said, why did you al low me to say these things. And she got angry with me, she blamed me for not le tting her know that I was Jewish. And wi -- a-after that it was -- never ever it was said, and she was okay. But sh e used to make anti-Semitic remarks all the time at the beginning, when we first met. And of course, I experienced anti-Semitism because when we used to go to the beach, to eastern shore, I saw signs saying, no Jews allowed. No Jews or, Gentiles only. No Jews or dogs allowed, or something. I saw that, it was very disturbing to me, and very, very shocking and surprising. I did si -- experience a little bit like that, but 54 otherwise, I wa -- no. Oh yes, there was a man that I was in a carpool with when I worked at the Fund, I won\u2122t men -- mention his name.

You know, it\u2122s peculiar, I -- I keep on telling myself it will be there, I don\u2122t need to buy two thi -- items at the same time.

I -- everything, nothing, you know, when we first -- when we were refugees, we lived in the children\u2122s home for thirt -- to start with, and we had six -- sixpence pocket money a week, six pence. And most of it went for [indecipherable] to ride home. Then I managed to save about 15 shillings. And then when we were split up -- when the war started we were split up, my little sister had to go to another room -- to another place. We were all split up, the three of us. And so I gave my 15 shillings to my little sister, because I always 55 said, I can always take care of myself, but she wi ll need -- be we had so little, we had nothing.
