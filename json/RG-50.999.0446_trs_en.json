My name is Bill Benson and\n| am the host of the museum's public program, First Person.\nThank you for joining us today. We are in our 14th year of First\nPerson. Our First Person today is Mrs. Susan Warsinger, whom\nwe shall meet shortly.\n\nThis 2013 season of First Person is made possible through\nthe generosity of the Louis Franklin Smith Foundation, to whom\nwe are grateful for again sponsoring First Person. | would like you\nto know that Mr. Louis Smith is here with us today. Right there.\nThank you, Louis.\n\nFirst Person is a series of conversations with survivors of\nthe Holocaust who share with us their firsthand accounts of their\nexperience during the Holocaust. Each guest serves as a\nvolunteer here at this museum. Our program will continue through\nmid August. The museum's website at www.ushmm.org provides\ninformation about each of our upcoming First Person guests.\n\nSusan Warsinger will share with us her First Person account\nof her experience during the Holocaust and as a survivor, for\nabout 45 minutes. If we have time toward the end of our program,\n\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection ,\nwe'll have an opportunity for you to ask Susan a few questions.\n\nThe life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the\ndecades. What you are about to hear from Susan is one\nindividual's account of the Holocaust.\n\nWe have prepared a brief slide presentation to help with her\nintroduction.\n\nSusi Hilsenrath was born in Bad Kreuznach, Germany. She\nwas the eldest of three children. Here we see Susan's family.\nFrom left to right is her brother Joseph, mother Ani with * in her\nlap, her father Israel, and Susan with her arm around her father.\n\nHere we see Susan and her brother Joseph.\n\nOn November 9-10, 1938, known as Kristallnacht, or Night\nof Broken Glass, Nazi thugs smashed the windows and\nfurnishings of the Hilsenrath family's home. Months later, Susan\nand Joseph were smuggled to France.\n\nIn May 1940, the German Army invaded France. Susan and\nJoseph were evacuated from a children's home in Paris to\nVersailles, where they were temporarily housed in Louie XIV's\npalace. Soon German soldiers arrived and the children fled with\ntheir guardians to the unoccupied part of the country under the\n\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection ;\nVichy government.\n\nThe arrows indicate their movement southward.\n\nWith the help of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, Susan\nand Joseph received permission to immigrate to the United\nStates. Information written on this tag that Susan wore identifies\nher name and states she is sailing for the United States on the SS\nSerpa Pinto.\n\nAfter crossing the Pyrenees to Spain, the two children sailed\nto Lisbon, Portugal, and arrived in New York in September 1941.\nSusan and her brother Joseph are highlighted here on this\nphotograph from a newspaper. Susan lives here in the\nWashington, DC area. She has three very accomplished\ndaughters, and as she notes nine wonderful grandchildren. She\nspent 29 years as an educator in the public school system.\n\nSusan's volunteer work at the museum includes being\na member of the Museum's Speakers' Bureau. She is also a \u201c\ntwo guide leading law enforcement officers, including FBI agents\nand law enforcement officers from all over the United States and\nfrom throughout the world through the museum's permanent\nexhibit. She gives tours to special groups such as college-aged\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nleaders and individual tours to visually and hearing impaired\npeople. During the summers, Susan participates in the museum's\nprogram Conversations in the Wexner Center, where she\nwelcomes questions and conversation in an intimate setting as\nshe discusses her experience during the Holocaust. Susan is\nalso giving tours for the museum's new exhibit, Some Were\nNeighbors: Collaboration and Complicity in the Holocaust. And\nshe is a member of the writing workshop for survivors here at the\nmuseum. You can read some of Susan's writings online on the\nmuseum's website.\n\nWith that, I'd like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First\nPerson, Mrs. Susan Warsinger.\n\n[Applause]\n\nSusan, thank you so much for joining us, for being willing to\nbe our First Person today. We have just an hour. You have so\nmuch to share. Weill start right away.

So you will just have to bear with me if | get to be a\nlittle bit childish every once in a while.\n\n| remember we moved a lot. We lived, had lived in a very\nnice house. All of a sudden, we didn't live in a spacious house\nanymore. It seemed to me like we were always moving from one\nabode to another, which was on an economic level.\n>> Bill Benson: With each move?\n>> Susan Warsinger: With each move. What happened was my\nfather had a thriving linen store and all of a sudden he didn't have\nit anymore. He was boycotted. How many of you have been to\nthe permanent exhibit? If you remember, there's this one big\nexhibit with an SA man standing in front of a store, and he is\nsaying, \"Buy only in German shops, buy only from German\npeople,\" as if we were not German people. So my father lost --\ncan you hear me when I'm talking this way or do you want me --\n>> Bill Benson: You're good.\n\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n>> Susan Warsinger: Can you hear me all right? OK.\n\nAll of sudden he didn't have his store anymore. | remember\nhe had to go to a farm to sell strawberries and cherries to the\npeople who were in our town. That's how he had to make his\nliving.\n>> Bill Benson: | remember you telling me that when he would\ncome home after he was forced to go and sell cherries and\nstrawberries, that you Knew when he had been able to sell a few\nby just the look on his face. | think you said he was smiling when\nhe'd come back, you knew he had been successful that particular\nday.\n>> Susan Warsinger: Yeah, yeah. We had some special signal, |\nremember between us. | remember, | don't know, maybe it was\nhow many baskets he sold or something. It was just a private\nthing | had with my father that | remember.\n>> Bill Benson: Tell us about the town. What kind of town was it?\nWas it a small town?\n>> Susan Warsinger: Bad Kreuznach is a spa. It's a place where\npeople come to recuperate from all kinds of illnesses. A lot of\npeople come there for pleasure, because It's a beautiful town.

They had a thriving Jewish community\nliving there. And then --\n>> Bill Benson: Your family had been there for a long time?\n>> Susan Warsinger: Yeah, my parents got married there.\n>> Bill Benson: How large was your family? Your extended\nfamily.\n>> Susan Warsinger: Well, we had a lot of relatives that were\nliving in Germany. I'll tell you at the end. The only ones that\nsurvived was my family, my immediate family.\n>> Bill Benson: It was a large extended family?\n>> Susan Warsinger: Yes. All of those didn't make it out.\n>> Bill Benson: What about your schooling in those early years?\n| remember you telling me that your first years of school were\nreally not very happy years for you.\n>> Susan Warsinger: No, they were not happy at all. | hated\ngoing to school, because kids were making fun of me. | seemed\nto be a normal little girl. | wasn't quite sure why they were making\nfun of me. So one day | didn't have to go to school anymore. | tell\nyou, | was really happy.

One grade sat in this\nrow, the second grade. We had 10 rows and he had to teach us\nall of the subjects.\n\n| tell you, we did OK. We learned a lot. We learned a lot\nfrom each other.\n>> Bill Benson: And it was happier?\n>> Susan Warsinger: It was.\n>> Bill Benson: You shared with me an incident where your\nmother had sent you to get bread, and you had to go through a\npark.\n>> Susan Warsinger: You want me to tell you about that?\n>> Bill Benson: | do, yeah.\n>> Susan Warsinger: OK. | hope you want to listen to this. | was\nthis little kid, and my mother used to give me the responsibility of\n\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0\ngoing to the grocery store.

So | felt very\nproud of myself, because | was the one that was providing\nnutrition to my family.\n[Laughter]\nHere, we live here, and the grocery store, let's say it's at the back\nof the auditorium. In order to get to the grocery store, | had to\nwalk through a park. | started, | had to go down the stairs, |\nwalked down the stairs. The caretaker of the park came to me, he\nsaid, \"Little girl, you cannot go through this park anymore.\" |\ncouldn't figure out why | couldn't go through the park. | went\nhome to my mother and | told her. She said, \"Well, just walk\naround the park to get there, walk this way, that way, go all the\nway around.\"\n\nSo the next time she gave me the money to go to buy\nsomething, maybe it was milk, so | got to the steps of the park,\nand | said to myself, | was very tired, so | thought, well, maybe |\nwould cut through, because | just didn't want to take all the way\naround. So | went through the park, and the caretaker came, and\nhe started to throw rocks at me, and he started to say horrible\n\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7\nthings about me. | was this little girl.\n\nThat wasn't the worst part. The worst part of my\nremembrance is he had a young girl who was just about my age,\nand she saw her father doing what he was doing, and he was her\nrole model. So she copied what he was doing, and she kept on\nthrowing rocks at me, calling me a dirty Jew and all kinds of other\nthings.\n\nSo | would never walk through that park again.\n>> Bill Benson: Susan, in 1938 your mother had another child, |\nthink your brother Joseph. She had no choice but to have him at\nhome. Why was that?\n>> Susan Warsinger: Well, Jewish people weren't allowed to go\nto the hospital. They had to have their baby at home. The picture\nthat you people saw before was my brother and |. We were sitting\non the steps, and we were sitting outside because my mother was\nhaving a baby.\n>> Bill Benson: You described a few minutes ago remembering\nmoving from place to place, and each time it was a smaller and as\nyou said lower down the socioeconomic scale. At one point, you\nended up in a place called Adolf Hitler Platz, was the name of the\n\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection .\nplace before you lived. You were living in a place with, | believe, a\nrabbi and his family. Tell us a little about that.\n>> Susan Warsinger: OK. Is it OK with you? OK.\n\nlt was a house, it was like an apartment house, it had like\nfour floors. On the first floor, my family occupied the first floor.\nThe rabbi lived on the second floor. A non-Jewish family lived on\nthe third floor. And on the fourth floor was an attic. Well, it was\none night my brother and | were very excited because the next\nday it was going to be my mother's birthday, and it was November\n9, 1938.\n\nAll of a sudden, these bricks, rocks were being thrown\nthrough our window. My brother was a year younger than | am,\nbut he was the brave one. He went to the window, and he looked\noutside, and he said to me that it was our neighbors that were\nthrowing the rocks and the bricks through the window. And he\nsaid there are several policemen, and if you had gone upstairs to\nsee the civil policemen, they're wearing the big, funny hats,\nwearing this blue unform. He was standing outside, like this, at\nthe edge of the crowd. He wasn't doing anything at all to stop the\npeople from throwing the bricks and rocks through the window.\n\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3\n\nSO we were very scared, my brother and | really were\nscared. We started to walk across the hall to our parents\u2019\nbedroom, and just as we were doing that some people had\nuprooted a telephone pole, and they smashed it through the front\ndoor, and our front door was made out of glass. It was made out\nof beautiful colored glass. They smashed through the front door,\nand the glass was being strewn all over. So we ran to our\nparents\u2019 bedroom, and we said, \"My goodness, what's\nhappening?\"\n\nThey always tried to protect us, and they always never tried\nto tell us what was happening. So my father said, \"Well, let's just\ngo hide up in the attic.\"\n\nSo we went up to the attic, and the rabbi's family was\nalready there, but the rabbi wasn't there. We found out later that\nthe people who went through our apartment, they looted a lot of\nour belongings. Also, when they got to the rabbi's apartment they\ndestroyed all of his artifacts and his books and much of his\nfurniture.\n\nSo we were hiding up in the attic. | looked out, there was\nthis little window and | looked out, and the rabbi was standing on\n\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection ,\nhis veranda. There were two SA men, the brown shirts probably\nthat you learned upstairs in the PE, they were holding him.\nAnother one came along and took ahold of him, cut off his beard\nand sent him to jail.\n>> Bill Benson: You saw that?\n>> Susan Warsinger: Yes, | did see that. | did.\n\nSo | went, | found out later that they didn't only do it to our\napartment, to the people in our building, but they did it to everyone\nIn our community. Not only did they do that to every Jewish family\nin the community, but they did loot all of the Jewish stores that\nwere left that were selling to Jewish people, because nobody else\nwas buying from them. Also, they burnt down our synagogue.\n\nNot only did they do that in our town of Bad Kreuznach, but they\ndid it all over Germany. That's why it's remembered as the Night\nof Broken Glass, which is called Kristallnacht.\n>> Bill Benson: November 9-10, your mother's birthday in 1938.\n>> Susan Warsinger: Yes.\n>> Bill Benson: Hundreds of synagogues in Germany were\nburned that night.\n>> Susan Warsinger: Yes.\n\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\n\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection s\n>> Bill Benson: Did you have any idea after that that it was\nwidespread, that that pogrom was everywhere in the country?\n>> Susan Warsinger: No, | didn't know about it until much later.\n>> Bill Benson: With the rabbi arrested, taken away, what about\nyour father?\n>> Susan Warsinger: My father wasn't taken away. Now, let me\ntell you why. My brother and | keep talking about it, and | should\nhave asked -- | mean my father has passed away, he's dead. |\ncan't ask him anymore. | should have asked him. But one of the\nthings that we think is either that he was, because he had been\nborn in Poland when he was a little kid, he came to Germany,\nmaybe because at that time the Nazis, the Germans were not at\nwar with Poland yet, because it was before they occupied Poland,\nwhich was in 1939. Maybe because he played chess with the\nchief of police. We talked about a third reason.\n>> Bill Benson: Otherwise, thousands of Jewish men were\nimprisoned on that night?\n>> Susan Warsinger: Exactly. Exactly.\n>> Bill Benson: You're all in the attic. How long did you stay\nthere?\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection -\n\n>> Susan Warsinger: | don't remember. Maybe a few days.\n>> Bill Benson: A few days.\n>> Susan Warsinger: Yes.\n>> Bill Benson: Do you remember anything of that time, being in\nthat attic and you were with the rabbi's family, too?\n>> Susan Warsinger: Since it was November, it had been the\napple-picking season, we had -- someone had gathered lots of\napples, piles of apples all over the attic. So we had plenty to eat,\nbecause we kept eating apples all the time.\n\nThen the kids, we played. We played all with them, we\nmade abacuses out of them -- abaci, sorry.\n>> Bill Benson: Abaci?\n>> Susan Warsinger: We made abaci out of them. We played all\nkinds of games with the apples. We were innocent children. We\nreally didn't understand how serious it was. All | know is that\nbefore the Night of Broken Glass, my father and mother used to\nhave discussions whether they wanted to leave Germany or not,\nand my mother was always for it and my father said, \"Oh, this is\ngoing to blow over and everything is going to be all right.\"\n>> Bill Benson: Hitler can't last?\n\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7\n>> Susan Warsinger: Yes, yes. But after the Night of Broken\nGlass, nobody wanted to stay there anymore.\n>> Bill Benson: That's when your parents made that very\nprofound decision to try to get out of Germany at that point?\n>> Susan Warsinger: Right.\n>> Bill Benson: After Kristallnacht when they made that decision,\nwhat did your parents do?\n>> Susan Warsinger: Well, my father realized that we have to get\nout of Germany, and in order to come to the United States, this is\nwhat everybody wanted to come to, is to come to the United\nStates, the land of democracy and freedom and where you could\nbe anything you wanted to be, you couldn't come to the United\nStates because the United States had a quota, and also every\ncountry in the world had a quota, except for the Dominican\nRepublic.\n\nSo my father said, well, he found this woman who was a\nFrench lady, and she had children of her own. She was willing to\ndo for all of the money that he had left, that he had saved up, she\nwas willing to smuggle my brother and me to France.\n>> Bill Benson: Just the two of you?\n\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection .e\n>> Susan Warsinger: The two of us.

The one looking out the\nwindow.\n>> Bill Benson: Year younger than you. She'd take the two of\nyou and your parents, they made the decision to let the two of you\ngo.\n>> Susan Warsinger: Yeah. Yeah. | guess, for me, it was like a\nbig adventure. | didn't realize that | might never see them again.\nBut | think that it must have been a horror for my mother, who had\nto send her children away.\n>> Bill Benson: I'm sure everybody in this room can't imagine\nwhat that would be like to send you away to another country.\n>> Susan Warsinger: Yeah. | keep thinking about when | had my\nthree girls, | couldn't imagine sending them away and not knowing\nwhat's going to happen to them.\n\nAnyway, it turned out OK. So we went to France, and we\nwent on the train and we had to keep very quiet, because we were\nsupposed to be French children. So when we got to the border,\n\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 10\nwe pretended we were sleeping and everything turned out all\nright. And we ended up in Paris.\n>> Bill Benson: Was there an incident where German soldiers or\nguards boarded the train?\n>> Susan Warsinger: Yeah.\n>> Bill Benson: Do you remember anything about that?\n>> Susan Warsinger: We were very scared. My brother\nremembers that we were -- he was fast asleep. He thinks, this is\nhis -- we never asked our parents. He thinks that maybe she\ndrugged us so we would be fast asleep, so we wouldn't be able to\nspeak German, because she was worried that we would say\nsomething in German and we wouldn't be her children. But! don't\nknow if that's correct or not.\n>> Bill Benson: You got across the border.\n>> Susan Warsinger: Yes.\n>> Bill Benson: Went to Paris. Once you're there with a French\nlady who, in effect, smuggled you out of the country, what was\nwaiting for you in Paris?\n>> Susan Warsinger: Well, my father had a third cousin, and he\nlived in Place de la Vendome. He had a hotel.

He was a working guy. He was\nyoung.\n>> Bill Benson: Single guy, right?\n>> Susan Warsinger: Single guy.\nHere he had these two children. My brother was very nervous.\nExcuse the expression, he used to wet himself in the bed. He\nwas upset and anyway, so he, the cousin, had to go to work, he\nleft us in the room. He said, \"You stay in the room until | come\nback.\" Of course, my brother was very curious, and he was 7,\nand he used to leave as soon as cousin -- he went on the Metro.\nIn those days the Metro was a big thing because it was the only\none besides in New York. So he went on the Metro. He went all\nover Paris. He made sure that he came home.\n>> Bill Benson: 7 years old?\n>> Susan Warsinger: Yeah.\n[Laughter]\n>> Bill Benson: Were you a good girl, you stayed put?\n>> Susan Warsinger: Yes. | always followed the rules. | still do\nthat.

So then he found a place\nwhere they would keep the bread, in a small town around Paris.\nThere was a lady who was taking children in, and | don't know\nwho it was, | think it was the Quakers. They were very generous\nto people. | want to thank the Quakers a lot for everything that\nthey did. They helped, and | think they paid for us to stay with this\nlady.\nWe were not the only children. We were maybe 10 children\nthat were lost.\n>> Bill Benson: She sort of took lost, orphaned children in?\n>> Susan Warsinger: Yes.\n>> Bill Benson: It wasn't a happy place?\n>> Susan Warsinger: Well, it's -- there was one place, she had a\ndaughter and she favored her daughter, was very sad occasion.\nAnyway, we complained to --\n>> Bill Benson: Is this the place where you were not allowed\ninside during the day?\n>> Susan Warsinger: Yeah.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9\n>> Bill Benson: Tell us about it.

She was French and her husband, she did the same thing\nto her husband. She made him stay outside too.\n[Laughter]\n| remember. The good part about her husband, he was eating\npon frietes. Those are French fries. That was the first time | ate\nFrench fries, the most delicious thing | ever ate.\nlt was unpleasant. She wouldn't let us go to the bathroom.\nWe had to go in a pot in the middle of the night. We weren't\nallowed to use the bathroom. In the morning somebody had to go\nclean up. Somebody complained.

He walked into Austria, then he said I'm going to take\nover Europe. So he took over Czechoslovakia. He went into\nPoland. So the next thing he did in 1940, which is June, the Nazis\nwere bombing, not Paris, but bombing all around. We could see\nin our bedroom, we could see the bombs falling down from the\nGerman planes. I'm sure you've seen them in the movies, the\nairplanes. It looked like the Fourth of July. | remember.\n\nSo everybody got really scared.

He remembers it very well. | don't know\nwhy we were in Paris, not in that place. When they came walking\ninto Paris, a lot of Parisians were really scared, not only Jewish\npeople, but we called them, the German army, the Boche.\nEverybody wanted to leave.\n\nsome people fraternized with the Nazis. But most\neverybody did not. So they wanted to leave. | don't know if you\nsaw on the map, you see Paris here, and then just think of one of\nthese rectangles as France. Half of it was the occupied zone of\nFrance, like half of that, and Paris is up here. It's the occupied\nzone.\n\nSo then they made some kind of a treaty with the French,\nand they said, well, the bottom part is going to be unoccupied, and\nwe were supposed to be free, but Petain was the president of that\npart of France, and he was an ally, really, of the Nazis.\n\nAnyway, so what everybody wanted to do was get to the\nsouthern part of France. But before that, everybody wanted to get\nout of Paris. So I'm going to ask the audience if they know what\nbeautiful town is right a little bit, 45 minutes west of Paris.\n\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0\nAnybody know which town I'm talking about?

But after the\nNight of Broken Glass, there wasn't anyplace to go, so not many\npeople were able to get out of Germany.

The Jews didn't want to talk about\nIt, because it was such a horrible experience. The Germans didn't\nwant to talk about it, because they were the perpetrators. The\nrest of the world didn't want to talk about it, because they didn't do\nanything. So everything was under the rug.\n\nIt wasn't until like 1993, like when this museum was built, is\nwhen the Jews were coming out. The thing is why are they doing\nall of this? Why are we talking so much about the Holocaust? It\nhad nothing to do with you, nothing to do with you or you, but it\ndoes, because we have to -- well, I'll talk about it later.\n>> Bill Benson: Susan, you now know that your parents, they're\nalive, they're in the United States, they're sending tickets so you\ncan get out of there.

He found a stash of pineapple\nthat the boat was carrying. It was not too far from where we were,\nwhere the room was, and we had never eaten any pineapple\nbefore in our entire life. He felt that that was the most delicious\nthing. So he kept on eating pineapple and pineapple, until he got\nreally sick on the boat. The boat ride was 14 days.

I'm just telling you this for a reason.\n\nSo 14 days were up, and they said it's 6:00 in the morning,\nwe were going to see the Statue of Liberty. So we were all very\nexcited. My brother was already up there the whole night waiting\nfor it to come. So we got up there, maybe a little bit before 6:00.\nThere was a fog. You could not see your hand in front of your\nface.

I'm telling you, I'm not making this up,\nat 6:00, at exactly 6:00, the fog rose just like the curtain in the\ntheater or when you go to the opera, the curtain rose and there\nwas the Statue of Liberty, right next to us.

So anyway, you might want to do that.\n| hope that you have a good learning experience. | want to thank Bill Benson for\nhelping me tell my story, and | want to thank the audience for coming to our museum\nand being witnesses to the history of the Holocaust and for listening to my story.\n[Applause]\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n\n",
