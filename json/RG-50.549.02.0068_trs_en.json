But Russian soldiers, Soviet Union soldiers were marching through the forest where I  was dying, actually. I -- usually when I was in the forest, I would dig a little grave and  cover it, camouflage it as much as I could and stay there as long as hunger and cold  would allow me to stay in one place. At that point I was very ill, I must have eaten  something that didn\u2019t agree with me. And I was in my own filth, surrounded by my own  filth, and I -- I think I was dying. I don\u2019t really recall one time, I think, that I wasn\u2019t  actually aware of it, and yet I must have been aware. When they literally stepped on me,  it was dark, at night and all of a sudden I felt -- I mean, in -- in the forest there are  always a lot of noises, so I didn\u2019t hear them coming. But all of a sudden I felt  something on my chest, and it was, I guess, one of the soldiers. And they realized it was  something alive. And to their credit and my luck, they did clean me up and put me ina  tent in a -- a military hospital and dragged me with them until we came to the city of  Luck, L-u-c-k, which is in the area where I come from. And there they found a -- a  regular hospital and they left me there. And apparently -- I never saw the note, but  apparently there was a note saying -- and I\u2019m paraphrasing, but it was something like, The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And that and my little penknife I had with me and  the gold -- gold coins and whatever else, and jewelry. And I still had one coin and I  gave it to them, to the two soldiers. I -- I do remember that, that was it. But other than  that, there was no real thank you or anything, for giving me back my life. But when I  ended up in the hospital at Luck, that\u2019s where they nursed me back to, I guess,  reasonable health. I did not speak for a long, long time, and I do remember that -- how I  regained my speech. I was on a ward. At that time, I mean, there were no private rooms,  or if there were I wasn\u2019t in one. And I was just in my cot, whatever, in clean sheets, it  was wonderful. And -- but I did not speak. And then all of a sudden there was an  attendant. It was not a doctor and it was not a nurse, but a young woman. And she was  sort of humming while she was doing things and all of a sudden she started singing a  song that my mother used to sing to me. And, I mean it just gave me chills and I started  talking. That, you know, brought back my speech. And it was a very, you know,  emotional day at that time. But when I was nursed back to health, I found there was one  other survivor from my hometown. And it seemed that most of the survivors -- the war  was not over yet in 1944, but for us, for all intents and purposes, the war was over. And  so everybody who survived tried to gather in a larger town. And Luck, or Lvov, which The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And  Horochow, my town, was also in between. So a lot of people gathered in Luck, and  that\u2019s where I was, in that hospital. And I came out of the hospital, I found a lot of --  not a lot, but survivors. And I did meet the other survivor from my hometown. They say  that there are more people who survived, but these were people who my father and  other people in Horochow helped escape before the war started and who eventually  ended up in what was then Palestine."

The people in our hometown -  and this was going on all over eastern Poland, I don\u2019t know about other countries, but  in eastern Po -- what used to be eastern Poland, the populace was very greedy and they  did get everything. All our possessions, all our material possessions ended up in their  hands because when we were ordered to go into the ghetto, we could only take with us  what we could carry, nothing else. And so everything else went to the neighbors and  whoever got ahold of it, or -- I don\u2019t know how the Germans and the Ukrainians at that  time directed and disposed of all the material goods. And then there were homes,  houses. And they felt, I\u2019m sure, the local populace, that whoever survived  [indecipherable] will come and say now, I want my house back, I want my -- all my  furniture back. I want my linens, my silver, my -- all sorts of stuff. And that probably --  and besides, there was still, and still 1s, there\u2019s great anti-Semitism in that area. And  they resented our surviving and that made us feel very, very hurt. And it seemed at that  point that there was a movement that -- you know how rumors start and all, and there  was a movement in our -- our -- our direction for everyone to gather in Germany.

And -- but the thing was that he didn't want to  put any more money into the house, and he left two rooms or so unfinished, and they  were still unfinished at the end of war, or when we came, you know, to -- to see.

And so I found a  place -- or, they f -- assigned me another place to live. But when my efforts to join my  family in -- in the United States were coming to nothing, I decided that perhaps -- I only  had a third grade education -- I decided maybe I could go to school and emigrate on a  student visa. And at that time I felt that -- I don\u2019t know why, but there was a DP camp  by the name Benzheim and that was between Darmstadt and Frankfurt, and very close  to Heidelberg. And I\u2019m not sure, but I think my father had a lot of, you know,  doctorates, and one of them, I think, was from Heidelberg. And I went to Heidelberg  and I spoke German at that -- you know, so I asked them if they would take me on as a  student. And they sort of looked me up and down, and where are your papers, you  know, from school? And I said I have none. And they were very helpful. They gave me  a tutor and they took all sorts of crazy tests. And because, I guess, I was a Jewish  survivor, they accepted me. I stayed there for over a year, and thought that I would go --  emigrate on a student visa. But by that time my papers started taking on importance and  I eventually ended up going on the papers that my family provided for me. But it took  three years after the war before I ended up in the United States. There\u2019s one other thing  that I would like to mention, and I do mention it all, you know, when I speak to schools, The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

I -- 1t was very  difficult for me to comprehend and to understand that even after the war, there were  pogroms in Poland. Not just eastern Poland, but all over Poland. Now, the eastern part  of Poland, after the war ended, became the property of the Soviet Union. So Poland was  actually divided. And the Poland that I knew from before the war was no more. It was --  a third of it was chunked off to the Soviet regime. And what was going on all over  Poland were pogroms, after the war. And the local populace was so resentful of our  surviving that to them the only solution of getting rid of us is to kill us. And I don\u2019t  know if you\u2019ve ever heard of Kielce. Kielce is someplace -- my geography is not that  good, but I think it\u2019s in central Poland. And Kielce was a big town, a big city and had a  lot of Jews before the war. On the fourth of July, 1946, the local populace got together  and murdered 42 Jewish survivors. And that was one of the most infamous pogroms. I  think they mention it on the second floor in the museum, when they talk about DP  camps and all. Kielce, one of the most infamous pogroms. And that was devastating to  hear when we were in the DP camps, about these happenings. And this was going on all  over the place in Poland. So when anybody says that now there are no Jews in Poland,  and consequently there can\u2019t be any anti-Semitism, it ain\u2019t so. It\u2019s not so, and I would  like to -- I wanted to make that point. The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

But, you know, I passed and everything was fine. So I  didn\u2019t have any social life at that time either. And by that time I was married and I  couldn\u2019t care less, you know?

Now this is probably -- I don\u2019t know how to express it,  but becoming a wife of an officer -- o-o-of an ar -- of a -- of a military person, was the  most important, wonderful thing that could have happened to me when I came to the  United States. Why? Because all of a sudden I was part of a group. I finally belonged. I  was a wife of a military person. And the military wives and all, accept you  unconditionally, without reservations, without questions, you are one of them, and they  take care of you. And I did not experience anything like this until I married my  husband, and until -- I mean, he wi -- became part of the military. And of course at that  time it was also, ah, a nice Jewish guy, what is he doing in the military, you know? But  at that point, and that\u2019s also like -- almost like a Domino effect, my husband went to  Germany and he was to serve there three years and then he would be out again, because  he was in the reserves. But in order, since I didn\u2019t go with him, so it was a year or so  before I became a citizen, an American citizen and was going to join him, so by that  time he only had two years or so. And the military isn\u2019t stupid. They said, well, if you --  if you want to bring your wife over, you have to sign up for three more years. Yeah. Or  something like that, I mean I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not quite sure. But anyway, so my husband had  to sign up for another three years to serve in order to bring me to Germany.

And there\u2019s one thing my mother-in-law did that I  really, at the time, like everything else, I didn\u2019t appreciate, but she did a very nice thing.  For the first Hanukkah after we got married, my mother-in-law gave me a cookbook  and rightly so, cause I didn\u2019t know, as I say, how to boil water. She was a magnificent  hostess. She -- and there was a large family, they -- my father-in-law was one of 12, and  my mother-in-law had a small family, but they lived again -- also, after they moved  from Franklin square, they moved to a very fancy place on the island with property on  the water, right on the water and she entertained beautifully, and she -- people would  come and visit like, you know, Sunday morning, she\u2019d say why -- why don\u2019t you stay  for dinner. And, you know, by the time she\u2019d look around she\u2019d have 25 people for  dinner. And she would just do it as, you know, talking to you or me. And I couldn\u2019t do  anything like that.

And there\u2019s this fashionable -- they still wear  them, they call them lederhosen, you know, the short -- she wanted to buy some. We  went into a shop and this salesgirl, you know, was yelling back, and she says, these are  Ammies, you know, Americans. How much do I -- you know, what kind of price do I  quote them? And they yelled back, telling them, you know, how much to ask, cause  things were not marked. And then in my purest holk-deutsch I answered that if the price  is different for the Ammies, we are not buying here. And we walked out, you know.  That gave me great satisfaction. And I mean, there were many instances, you know,  there that they didn\u2019t like the Americans even though we, you know, with the Marshall  plan and everything, we did so much for the Germans, they still resent -- that\u2019s probably  why they resented us. And you would go and you would see signs, Ammie go home,  you know. And that was in the 50\u2019s, but that\u2019s the way it was.

I did get a  telephone call from one of my compatriots who lived already in the American section,  which we later did get housing and we joined. And she called me to let me know that  my husband was killed in the typhoon. He was on a boat because his lab was on a little  island off Yakoska. Yakoska 1s a port, and we always used to make fun that everything  was Classified, but you go to Yakoska because you know, it is a -- a -- what do you call  it, port city, and on all the bars and all it says, welcome the Enterprise. In other words,  Enterprise the ship is arriving. It was supposed to be classified, but they na -- knew it  all. Well anyway, this friend called me to say that my husband was killed. He drown --  his little boat that he was going from the lab, he was trying to come back home, and  then the boat capsized and he drowned.

And I  feel that\u2019s wrong. When you go someplace and -- where you\u2019re assigned, you are a  representative, you\u2019re an ambassador of your country to the country that you are  visiting, because that\u2019s all you\u2019re doing, you\u2019re vi -- you are a visitor, and you should  show your best side.

Meanwhile, and then at -- this 1s again not correct  chronologically, before my husband went for the second time to Vietnam, we belonged  to Fort Belvoir, which is a military group here, and there was a Jewish chapel and a  chaplain. We did get a call from our old friend, Rabbi Elster, who said that he was  coming to take over the pulpit at Agudas Achim in Alexandria. And of course, when we  heard that, we joined Agudas Achim and we are still members today. But Rabbi Elster\u2019s  not there any more. But at that time we refreshed -- I mean, we -- we -- we were such  good friends to begin with, it was wonderful to be again with them, with the Elsters,  and he became our rabbi.

Peculiarities or for my idiosyncrasies. I was his mother, and as his mother he  loved me the way I am. And that was his main argument, that it didn\u2019t have anything to  do with being a survivor. He accepted me the way I was. He didn\u2019t blame it on the  Holocaust or on my being a survivor, why I had temper tantrums, why I yelled at him,  why I wanted him to be better than perfect.

She did get married, like you were mentioning, in -- at the DP  camp, in Benzheim. She married a -- a middle -- an older -- mostly it used to be, you  know, older men. She married a very nice, very fine fellow, and he had a brother, and af - the brother had also a family and they all -- they all emigrated to America together.  And my friend\u2019s -- Rya is her name -- Rya\u2019s mother was still alive. And all of them  ended up in the United States, I think about a year before I did. How they were able to  do that, I don\u2019t know, but sh-she was the only one I kept in touch with.

Maybe it was a need, I don\u2019t know, but I felt 1t was time because I was in one  place and I wasn\u2019t going to go overseas again. And so when the time came, as it was,  there was going to be, I think the first gathering of survivors in Washington, D.C., and I  think it was 1983, and I attended it. It was not quite a week, but it was more than one  day, I don\u2019t recall exactly. And there I met many new people, and some whom I have  known from the DP camps, and it was nice to be together. It was a rather emotional and  solemn gathering. And most of the people that I knew have settled and have also started  their own lives and were successful in becoming Americanized.

And he made a very emotional and very  memorable speech at that meeting, and he was telling us -- he was -- he was born in  Bergen-Belsen, where his parents ended up at the end of the war. And when they said, I  was born in Bergen-Belsen, people said, oh in a deep -- in a concentration camp? No, at  that time it was a DP camp. But he was born in that camp, and he became very active  and he still is. I forgot his first name, but you know, that I remember from that meeting.  And after that meeting, things were quiet, but it\u2019s sort of like -- it gave me a little seed  in my mind. I knew I had to do something, I didn\u2019t know what, and I didn\u2019t know what  I was ready to do. At that point we did belong to Agudas Achim and our friend Shelly  Elster the rabbi, was still with us. And I went to him and I said, I want to do something  to honor the memory of all the ones, the millions who perished in the Holocaust. And  he looked at me and right away he says, why don\u2019t you become a Bat Mitzvah? You  know what a Bat Mitzvah is, I mean, here. I said, oh, but I don\u2019t know. And Hebrew, I  don\u2019t know any prayers. I mean, you know, I-I was really an ignoramus when it came  to, you know, Hebrew reading, and chanting and all that. He says, I\u2019ll teach you.

And they started observing -- at that time they did already observe it  at the rotunda, you know, in the Capitol. But our synagogue usually had sort of a  religious school, you know, commemoration or something, not as elaborate and all, but  just to commemorate. And I said well, I don\u2019t know, but if I -- I don\u2019t think I could  learn by April, you know, all the chanting and all the Haftorah and everything. Cause I  didn\u2019t know any of the blessings in Hebrew, nothing. Didn\u2019t even know how to read.  And he says, I\u2019Il teach you, and he proceeded to teach me. And by April, to make it -- it  was very difficult and it took an awful lot of time, and my husband said he could recite  some of the prayers in his sleep because he heard me repeating them so many times.  And came f -- when -- when April came, I don\u2019t remember what day, I think it was also  the 25\"\" or something, 21\u00b0 or 25\", I was ready for my -- for becoming a Bat Mitzvah.  And I learned all the chanting and all this in the three months. And that was very -- a  very nice accomplishment. I invited the entire congregation and actually some of my  relatives from Columbus, Ohio and New York, and some of them came. And they said  later, they said, yeah we came because we felt sorry for you and we didn\u2019t want you to  fall on your face without family around. Well, I didn\u2019t fall on my face. I astounded  them all because I did the whole thing. Usually kids, you know, learn from very  beginning and then it takes them a year or so. And I chanted it all and did a good job, if The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

And after that we did attend synagogue pretty regularly, maybe  not every Saturday or -- but around that time when I was preparing for my Bat Mitzvah,  I did. I wrote a poem for that occasion and I made -- and my remarks were centered  around the theme that this is Yom HaShoah and I\u2019d like -- this is my way of honoring  all the millions who perished during the Holocaust. And it was -- I felt very good about  it. Well, at this time my wonderful rabbi was preparing kids for their confirmation class - I mean for their graduation, they have Hebrew school and then, you know, religious  school and then the people -- the students who want to go on after their bat mit -- Bar  and Bat Mitzvah when -- they call them to confirmation class. And he says, you must  go and speak to my kids in confirmation class. And I looked at him, I said, Shelly, I  cannot do that. I -- my English isn\u2019t good. I -- I -- I don\u2019t have my story, you know, in --  in my head. He says, I don\u2019t care. And that was a Sunday morning when he has a class.  He dragged me in and he says, Ill give you questions and you answer. And that was my  first presentation, against my will. I was petrified, and I mean, I -- I was not a public  speaker, not that I am now, but I -- I -- it was very difficult and it was really, I mean, he  pushed me and I was angry with him that he did. But 1t was a wonderful beginning. Not  a wonderful, but a beginning of something that I realized I had to do. And what I  realized at that time -- I mean then, the next Sunday he had another class, and he says, The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

You must -- and you  know, the first time when I made this presentation, when I finished, I got sick to my  stomach, you know, went and threw up. But little by little, it was easier as time went  on, and then I realized that this is what I have to do. I have to bear witness, I have to  share my experiences, especially with young people. And Rabbi Elster gave me the  push in the right direction, and because of him I started doing this. And it grew from  that one, first confirmation class."

And the reception -- as the years go by -- the reception\u2019s  always been very cordial, but it seems that the students now, especially in high schools  and middle schools, the students are much more knowledgeable because the teachers  offer so much more information. And that happens in turn because the museum and  other places, I\u2019m sure, too, offer so many wonderful courses that inform the teachers  how to re -- how to teach the Holocaust.

And then when  they finished listening to the description and going through the rooms, they -- each one  would receive a tile, and they had to register their impressions with painting a  statement.

It\u2019s not a catharsis, no way. Many times I -- I -- I went with David Klevin the other day  to a school and I -- usually they allot me -- allow me to speak an hour, maybe two at the  most. And there, I think I was there 9:15, didn\u2019t get out until one o\u2019clock, because the  kids had so many questions and they had the time from other subjects, they allowed  them to stay, you know, and que -- question me. And when I got home, you know what  I did? Went to bed. I was emotionally drained and that happens a lot. So it is not a  catharsis, but it feels that -- it feels that I have to do it.

And then, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m proficient any more,  but at that time I thought, well, I\u2019d rather be with people. I want to do something where  I\u2019m not going to be by myself.

Some of these people  have selfish motives. They don\u2019t want to be remind -- reminded of their experiences,  and they don\u2019t want to have anything to do with it. I remember one meeting we  attended -- every year we have international meetings, that people from all over Israel  and from Europe come to these meetings. And every month we have our own meetings.  Once we had an international meeting, and I met two brothers from Connecticut, two  brothers who survived the Holocaust. One brother talks about it all the time -- not all  the time, but I mean, he is facing reality and his past. The other guy is -- he -- it\u2019s the  first time he introduced him cause that was the first time he ever came to a meeting, that  was an international meeting. And he has never spoken about his experiences. He\u2019s  married to an American woman who doesn\u2019t know his past.

And I mean, eventually, after some debate and  all, they magnanimously allowed my husband to come to the meetings. Now, this  situation has sort of evolved. Now spouses, if they are not survivors, are allowed to  come. But it\u2019s sort of a real closed group. They don\u2019t want to have any kind of  relationship with anybody else.

Since September 11\", you  see stickers, I\u2019m proud to be an American. You see the flag on cars and I think it did  awake our patriotism and our pride in being an American. And it didn't do that when  Chechnya started, when Bosnia started, when Uganda started, when -- when all these  other terrible, you know, wars started su -- on a different soil, not on American soil.  And this is why I think it\u2019s different. I might be -- I\u2019m probably very wrong, but this is  my explanation.

So we\u2019ve had several and  the last one, poor guy, he now has Parkinson\u2019s. But Hadassah and Jakov Granat and he  was the military attach\u00e9 here in Washington. Can\u2019t remember the years, it\u2019s terrible.  But anyway, when we were visiting Israel, we got in touch with the Granats and we had  a wonderful time visiting them. And then I did get in touch with some people with  whom I was -- I wasn\u2019t in the same DP camp, but they were in a neighboring, there  were so many of them. And there was one guy there who was my father\u2019s student. And  he ended up he didn't make it to Palestine, he ended up being caught and he ended up in  the Polish army when the war started, and so he had a story of his own. But when he  came out after the war, he s -- found out that I was alive and he came to say hello. And  through me he met this other girl, who was in a different DP camp and they fell in love  and they got married. So we visited with them."

There was a Catholic priest -- they  have a priest and a rabbi and all at the Walter Reed Hospital, and this priest just start --  just happened to pass when I was sitting there, and I mean, I wasn\u2019t crying, but I was  sitting in the corner waiting for some results.

But a Catholic priest, you know, had so much  compassion. That gives me hope, because there is something good in every human  being. And I also have another philosophy.

Say only when you have something nice  to say, otherwise don\u2019t. And if you feel, you know, anger and all, try to concentrate and  try to find something nice about that person.

Yes, my mother was a very  special woman, but she wasn\u2019t the only one. I think ordinary people -- and my mother  was not ordinary, she was extraordinary, but I think even ordinary people were made  extraordinary by their circumstances in the ghetto.

That\u2019s another thing that I, nowadays feel very strongly  about it, and I keep learning much more, 1s the fact that there was so much resistance,  and there was so much -- there were uprisings, you know, all over the place. Sobibor,  Auschwitz, and of course, Warsaw. But I was reading someplace just recently that there  was resistance in 105 different ghettos. And I think probably it will come up that it -- it  was more than 105 ghettos. Cause my mother\u2019s school, that\u2019s resistance. The -- our kids  getting together, about 20 of us, building a tunnel. Tunnel, it wasn\u2019t really a tunnel, but  it was a tunnel. That\u2019s resistance. And these kind of forms of resistance took place  almost in every little ghetto. And that is something that when we consider that there  was practically no help from the outside, and even in -- in the Warsaw ghetto, how  difficult it was to obtain weapons, and you know, how very -- even for money -- I  mean, people would, on the outside, would promise you weapons, and then you would  come and you\u2019d find empty shells or you know, corroded things that didn\u2019t work. And  when you think, that in spite of all of this, we were able to raise our voice, we should  walk now with our heads high, too. And I often say I\u2019m very proud to be who I am. I  wouldn\u2019t change it for the world. And I am proud of being a Jew. And I am proud of  having to sur-survive -- of having survived. But until recently, I had enormous guilt.
