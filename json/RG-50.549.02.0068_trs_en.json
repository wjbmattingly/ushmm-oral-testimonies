But Russian soldiers, Soviet Union soldiers were marching through the forest where I was dying, actually. I -- usually when I was in the forest, I would dig a little grave and cover it, camouflage it as much as I could and stay there as long as hunger and cold would allow me to stay in one place. At that point I was very ill, I must have eaten something that didn\u2019t agree with me. And I was in my own filth, surrounded by my own filth, and I -- I think I was dying. I don\u2019t really recall one time, I think, that I wasn\u2019t actually aware of it, and yet I must have been aware. When they literally stepped on me, it was dark, at night and all of a sudden I felt -- I mean, in -- in the forest there are always a lot of noises, so I didn\u2019t hear them coming. But all of a sudden I felt something on my chest, and it was, I guess, one of the soldiers. And they realized it was something alive. And to their credit and my luck, they did clean me up and put me ina tent in a -- a military hospital and dragged me with them until we came to the city of Luck, L-u-c-k, which is in the area where I come from. And there they found a -- a regular hospital and they left me there. And apparently -- I never saw the note, but apparently there was a note saying -- and I\u2019m paraphrasing, but it was something like, The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And that and my little penknife I had with me and the gold -- gold coins and whatever else, and jewelry. And I still had one coin and I gave it to them, to the two soldiers. I -- I do remember that, that was it. But other than that, there was no real thank you or anything, for giving me back my life. But when I ended up in the hospital at Luck, that\u2019s where they nursed me back to, I guess, reasonable health. I did not speak for a long, long time, and I do remember that -- how I regained my speech. I was on a ward. At that time, I mean, there were no private rooms, or if there were I wasn\u2019t in one. And I was just in my cot, whatever, in clean sheets, it was wonderful. And -- but I did not speak. And then all of a sudden there was an attendant. It was not a doctor and it was not a nurse, but a young woman. And she was sort of humming while she was doing things and all of a sudden she started singing a song that my mother used to sing to me. And, I mean it just gave me chills and I started talking. That, you know, brought back my speech. And it was a very, you know, emotional day at that time. But when I was nursed back to health, I found there was one other survivor from my hometown. And it seemed that most of the survivors -- the war was not over yet in 1944, but for us, for all intents and purposes, the war was over. And so everybody who survived tried to gather in a larger town. And Luck, or Lvov, which The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And Horochow, my town, was also in between. So a lot of people gathered in Luck, and that\u2019s where I was, in that hospital. And I came out of the hospital, I found a lot of -- not a lot, but survivors. And I did meet the other survivor from my hometown. They say that there are more people who survived, but these were people who my father and other people in Horochow helped escape before the war started and who eventually ended up in what was then Palestine."

She was actually married before the war and had a baby, but she lost her entire family, and she survived by herself.

And there we were not greeted very warmly. The people in our hometown - and this was going on all over eastern Poland, I don\u2019t know about other countries, but in eastern Po -- what used to be eastern Poland, the populace was very greedy and they did get everything. All our possessions, all our material possessions ended up in their hands because when we were ordered to go into the ghetto, we could only take with us what we could carry, nothing else. And so everything else went to the neighbors and whoever got ahold of it, or -- I don\u2019t know how the Germans and the Ukrainians at that time directed and disposed of all the material goods. And then there were homes, houses. And they felt, I\u2019m sure, the local populace, that whoever survived [indecipherable] will come and say now, I want my house back, I want my -- all my furniture back. I want my linens, my silver, my -- all sorts of stuff. And that probably -- and besides, there was still, and still 1s, there\u2019s great anti-Semitism in that area. And they resented our surviving and that made us feel very, very hurt. And it seemed at that point that there was a movement that -- you know how rumors start and all, and there was a movement in our -- our -- our direction for everyone to gather in Germany.

And -- but the thing was that he didn't want to put any more money into the house, and he left two rooms or so unfinished, and they were still unfinished at the end of war, or when we came, you know, to -- to see. My friend, the other survivor, lived actually on the outskirts of Horochow, and it was a little village, almost like a suburb and the name of it was Skamelka. And she went back there, and she didn\u2019t find anyone very receptive, very happy about her survival. She was actually hidden by a farmer throughout the entire war. So she had one friend.

I\u2019ve gotten rid of the hate and the anger because it was destroying me personally, but I feel a great disappointment by the fact or from the fact that our neighbors and our town, where we co-existed in a very nice way, my father and mother and other Jewish leaders were working hand in hand with the Gentile population for the good of the entire community.

It was envy because they worked hard, most of them were poor peasants, you know, and they never accomplished anything in their lives. They never became educated, they didn\u2019t stress education. And they were always working and they were poor peasants in the beginning and they were poor peasants at the end. And maybe that\u2019s why, I don\u2019t know.

I -- 1t was very difficult for me to comprehend and to understand that even after the war, there were pogroms in Poland. Not just eastern Poland, but all over Poland. Now, the eastern part of Poland, after the war ended, became the property of the Soviet Union. So Poland was actually divided. And the Poland that I knew from before the war was no more. It was -- a third of it was chunked off to the Soviet regime. And what was going on all over Poland were pogroms, after the war. And the local populace was so resentful of our surviving that to them the only solution of getting rid of us is to kill us. And I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard of Kielce. Kielce is someplace -- my geography is not that good, but I think it\u2019s in central Poland. And Kielce was a big town, a big city and had a lot of Jews before the war. On the fourth of July, 1946, the local populace got together and murdered 42 Jewish survivors. And that was one of the most infamous pogroms. I think they mention it on the second floor in the museum, when they talk about DP camps and all. Kielce, one of the most infamous pogroms. And that was devastating to hear when we were in the DP camps, about these happenings. And this was going on all over the place in Poland. So when anybody says that now there are no Jews in Poland, and consequently there can\u2019t be any anti-Semitism, it ain\u2019t so. It\u2019s not so, and I would like to -- I wanted to make that point. The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

We became fast friends, Rabbi Elster and Shulamit Elster, and now they have three married kids. But our friendship started at Fort Lee. My husband was at Fort Lee and then he got orders for Vietnam. I think it was 1964, and between Fort Lee and -- and the Pentagon, you know, and some other places that he would go like for six weeks and come back.

He was very much against our involvement in Vietnam, and when he got -- but he was in the military and they ordered him, so he went. He expressed his, I guess his views to the higher ups, and he wasn\u2019t the only one, because he said, this is a kind of war that we cannot win, because we are trained to conduct a -- a re -- what do you call it, a -- a regular war, and these people are not terrorists, but they are guerillas and they were fighting the war in Vietnam from the underground. They had th -- we went to Vietnam just five years ago, and I saw these tunnels and all. They were fighting everything from the underground. And my husband and several -- and other people, the younger, the younger officers said this is ki -- the kind of war it cannot be won. But of course, they didn\u2019t listen to them. But, when my husband got orders to Vietnam, I decided in my infinite wisdom -- I\u2019m being sarcastic - to go to Columbus, to stay in Columbus. Why? Because I had family there, my aunt was still there. I -- so I rented an apartment near where she lived, and enrolled my son, at that time I think he was in third grade, and he had his cousins there, you know. I say cousins, but they were my cousins, but he counted them as his cousins. And we lived the year that my husband was in Vietnam in Columbus, Ohio. Was a miserable year.

And then when he came, with the reception he got in Columbus was just absolutely dem-demoralizing. His next orders were to work with the chiefs of staff and the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon.

Well, lo and behold, in 1969 he got orders to go back to Vietnam to the same petroleum job. But this time he was going to Play Ku, which is the mountainous area. And he -- this time he had his own chopper and he had to supply the fuels not just for Vietnam, but for the entire area of all the countries around, a very big job.

And everyone in that second generation, and th-that\u2019s another story, tried to blame the parents for their short -- for their shortcomings or for their not realizing their dreams or so, because their parents were survivors. And Stephen said that he and I got along and he accepted me the way I was because I am his mother. But he didn\u2019t blame the Holocaust for my what do you call it? Peculiarities or for my idiosyncrasies. I was his mother, and as his mother he loved me the way I am. And that was his main argument, that it didn\u2019t have anything to do with being a survivor. He accepted me the way I was. He didn\u2019t blame it on the Holocaust or on my being a survivor, why I had temper tantrums, why I yelled at him, why I wanted him to be better than perfect. He felt that\u2019s the way I am and that\u2019s what I wanted from him. And I don\u2019t know, but maybe it was good. Was a very healthy, it seems to me, attitude. And now he\u2019s very interested. He doesn\u2019t have much time to be involved with second generation, but like two months from now or I think this early spring, I\u2019m being invited by my grandsons class to speak about my experiences, and he\u2019ll introduce me. And that is a day that I can\u2019t wait for. And my grandson does not know much. He does, but he is now 11 and when Stephen was 11 he knew a lot more.

She did get married, like you were mentioning, in -- at the DP camp, in Benzheim. She married a -- a middle -- an older -- mostly it used to be, you know, older men. She married a very nice, very fine fellow, and he had a brother, and af- the brother had also a family and they all -- they all emigrated to America together.

And so when the time came, as it was, there was going to be, I think the first gathering of survivors in Washington, D.C., and I think it was 1983, and I attended it. It was not quite a week, but it was more than one day, I don\u2019t recall exactly. And there I met many new people, and some whom I have known from the DP camps, and it was nice to be together. It was a rather emotional and solemn gathering. And most of the people that I knew have settled and have also started their own lives and were successful in becoming Americanized.

And he made a very emotional and very memorable speech at that meeting, and he was telling us -- he was -- he was born in Bergen-Belsen, where his parents ended up at the end of the war. And when they said, I was born in Bergen-Belsen, people said, oh in a deep -- in a concentration camp? No, at that time it was a DP camp. But he was born in that camp, and he became very active and he still is. I forgot his first name, but you know, that I remember from that meeting. And after that meeting, things were quiet, but it\u2019s sort of like -- it gave me a little seed in my mind. I knew I had to do something, I didn\u2019t know what, and I didn\u2019t know what I was ready to do. At that point we did belong to Agudas Achim and our friend Shelly Elster the rabbi, was still with us. And I went to him and I said, I want to do something to honor the memory of all the ones, the millions who perished in the Holocaust. And he looked at me and right away he says, why don\u2019t you become a Bat Mitzvah? You know what a Bat Mitzvah is, I mean, here. I said, oh, but I don\u2019t know. And Hebrew, I don\u2019t know any prayers. I mean, you know, I-I was really an ignoramus when it came to, you know, Hebrew reading, and chanting and all that. He says, I\u2019ll teach you.

And they started observing -- at that time they did already observe it at the rotunda, you know, in the Capitol. But our synagogue usually had sort of a religious school, you know, commemoration or something, not as elaborate and all, but just to commemorate. And I said well, I don\u2019t know, but if I -- I don\u2019t think I could learn by April, you know, all the chanting and all the Haftorah and everything. Cause I didn\u2019t know any of the blessings in Hebrew, nothing. Didn\u2019t even know how to read. And he says, I\u2019Il teach you, and he proceeded to teach me. And by April, to make it -- it was very difficult and it took an awful lot of time, and my husband said he could recite some of the prayers in his sleep because he heard me repeating them so many times. And came f -- when -- when April came, I don\u2019t remember what day, I think it was also the 25\"\" or something, 21\u00b0 or 25\", I was ready for my -- for becoming a Bat Mitzvah. And I learned all the chanting and all this in the three months. And that was very -- a very nice accomplishment. I invited the entire congregation and actually some of my relatives from Columbus, Ohio and New York, and some of them came. And they said later, they said, yeah we came because we felt sorry for you and we didn\u2019t want you to fall on your face without family around. Well, I didn\u2019t fall on my face. I astounded them all because I did the whole thing. Usually kids, you know, learn from very beginning and then it takes them a year or so.

And after that we did attend synagogue pretty regularly, maybe not every Saturday or -- but around that time when I was preparing for my Bat Mitzvah, I did. I wrote a poem for that occasion and I made -- and my remarks were centered around the theme that this is Yom HaShoah and I\u2019d like -- this is my way of honoring all the millions who perished during the Holocaust. And it was -- I felt very good about it. Well, at this time my wonderful rabbi was preparing kids for their confirmation class- I mean for their graduation, they have Hebrew school and then, you know, religious school and then the people -- the students who want to go on after their bat mit -- Bar and Bat Mitzvah when -- they call them to confirmation class. And he says, you must go and speak to my kids in confirmation class. And I looked at him, I said, Shelly, I cannot do that. I -- my English isn\u2019t good. I -- I -- I don\u2019t have my story, you know, in -- in my head. He says, I don\u2019t care. And that was a Sunday morning when he has a class.

I was petrified, and I mean, I -- I was not a public speaker, not that I am now, but I -- I -- it was very difficult and it was really, I mean, he pushed me and I was angry with him that he did. But 1t was a wonderful beginning. Not a wonderful, but a beginning of something that I realized I had to do.

You must -- and you know, the first time when I made this presentation, when I finished, I got sick to my stomach, you know, went and threw up. But little by little, it was easier as time went on, and then I realized that this is what I have to do. I have to bear witness, I have to share my experiences, especially with young people.

Well, it was my turn, because I participated in it, to speak that day and I got up, wherever it was, and there were all these kids, you know, sitting and listening to my story. And I made it very simple, because it -- these were young kids. But after I was finished this guy comes over, and there were several parents, obviously, you know, with the kids and they were always very nice and asked meaningful questions. But this time this guy comes over and looks at me and first of all he says, now what\u2019s your na -- hey, you, you know, what\u2019s your name? Usually I say, Charlene Schiff.

And usually they honor my request if it\u2019s possible. In this school they did use the auditorium and there were about 500 kids or so, yeah. The whole middle school. And after my presentation I always ask to have a Q and A and the kids started raising their hands with questions. And in the middle of this all, or you know, a few minutes after the questioning started, this one kid gets up and most of them were wearing very nice clothes, school clothes, you know, jeans and all. This kid had a hat, what do you call it, a -- with the visor in the back. I don\u2019t know what you call it, but anyway, he looked like he was sort of a troublemaker. Tall, good-looking kid, dark.

And I -- he was looking to see that people will start laughing. It was dead silence. I said, as far as I\u2019m concerned, even one was too many. And are you satisfied now that you made your joke? Just like that. And he says, it\u2019s not a joke. And I said yes, it is a joke. And he was standing there. And after I said, you know, tha -- you - you finished with your joke or whatever, and even one is too many, the whole audience got up and started applauding and I got a standing ovation. And at that time he walked out. And then I found out he is -- he was from a Muslim f -- you know, household and his father was a Muslim and he came -- he would come to school always with very contradictory statements and all. I wish the teachers had warned me. I don\u2019t know what I would had done differently, but nobody did until after it happened. And those two instances were my only instances where it was unpleasant and traumatic, very traumatic. But other than that, I never had that kind of an experience.

They don\u2019t want to be remind -- reminded of their experiences, and they don\u2019t want to have anything to do with it. I remember one meeting we attended -- every year we have international meetings, that people from all over Israel and from Europe come to these meetings. And every month we have our own meetings. Once we had an international meeting, and I met two brothers from Connecticut, two brothers who survived the Holocaust. One brother talks about it all the time -- not all the time, but I mean, he is facing reality and his past. The other guy is -- he -- it\u2019s the first time he introduced him cause that was the first time he ever came to a meeting, that was an international meeting. And he has never spoken about his experiences. He\u2019s married to an American woman who doesn\u2019t know his past. I mean, I don\u2019t see how you can live with a person and not tell her your story. But anyway, he doesn\u2019t want to face it.

The general who was in charge of the Rwanda, you know, contingent, and he was promised by the United Nations to get all the help he needed, and when he got to Rwanda, all he saw is death and destruction and massacre and not any help from the United Nations. And consequently he resigned his post and became a drunk for awhile. I mean, now he wrote a book and he speaks about this situation. That churns within me and it makes me sick, physically ill. All this, Bosnia and all that. But to the American psyche, I think one of the most important thing, do anything, but don\u2019t come to my beloved America, to my soil, on my soil. Don\u2019t do anything on my soil. And sin the -- since the Civil War and all, all the wars were fought outside of the United States. And September 11\", sadly, touched us right here. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to the Americans. That\u2019s the way I figure. I also have seen something here that I was missing all these years. We went to Israel, can\u2019t remember when, in the 80\u2019s, and the first thing that struck me was the fantastic pride and patriotism that the people have. Maybe they\u2019re not as observant, you know, religiously, but when they wore that uni -- wore th- the uniform of the military, they did it with pride, wearing it and holding their heads up high.

Since September 11\", you see stickers, I\u2019m proud to be an American. You see the flag on cars and I think it did awake our patriotism and our pride in being an American. And it didn't do that when Chechnya started, when Bosnia started, when Uganda started, when -- when all these other terrible, you know, wars started su -- on a different soil, not on American soil. And this is why I think it\u2019s different. I might be -- I\u2019m probably very wrong, but this is my explanation. And that\u2019s why, until now, am -- most places, I always when I start my remarks, since September 11\", I start with the horrible tragedy of September 11\", and I compare it. And I -- I do say it has no comparison to the Holocaust, but it is also driven by evil, by -- by people who hate, blind hate, and by people who have no regards for human life. And this is one thing that we must fight for. And I -- I have my four evil eyes, and I say even now, 55 years after the Holocaust, we must all fight the four evil eyes.

That\u2019s another thing that I, nowadays feel very strongly about it, and I keep learning much more, 1s the fact that there was so much resistance, and there was so much -- there were uprisings, you know, all over the place. Sobibor, Auschwitz, and of course, Warsaw. But I was reading someplace just recently that there was resistance in 105 different ghettos. And I think probably it will come up that it -- it was more than 105 ghettos. Cause my mother\u2019s school, that\u2019s resistance. The -- our kids getting together, about 20 of us, building a tunnel. Tunnel, it wasn\u2019t really a tunnel, but it was a tunnel. That\u2019s resistance. And these kind of forms of resistance took place almost in every little ghetto. And that is something that when we consider that there was practically no help from the outside, and even in -- in the Warsaw ghetto, how difficult it was to obtain weapons, and you know, how very -- even for money -- I mean, people would, on the outside, would promise you weapons, and then you would come and you\u2019d find empty shells or you know, corroded things that didn\u2019t work. And when you think, that in spite of all of this, we were able to raise our voice, we should walk now with our heads high, too. And I often say I\u2019m very proud to be who I am.
