They've been crying and they've been they didn't want it. And so one of the brother of little Curstis(ph), this woman who is now in Argentina kicked them out, kicked them out from the stairs. And when little __+many years later told me the story, she was still angry with her brother that he did it. So they've been walking through Vangloof. And I think everybody knew them in the city. And they've been crying. And no one saw them, so it was some kind of, you know, miracle. They came to the station. They took the train. They found the engineer. And the engineer and my aunt from Warsaw ghetto probably she was already there.

And the complexities for me like, you know, the only tool I have, you know, to face the subject of the work. And in the same time, yes, you are asking you have been asking me how the audience reacts. It's changing. I think that, you know, for example, Polish audience in Interview with Agnieszka Holland 10 the times of the communists, they have been accepting complexity very easily, and not only accepting the realities as presented as complex, but also the language is complex, that the style is complex, that they are using metaphors and symbols and so on. So it was very you know _ and very curious audience, and they wanted to understand something about themselves. Now, it's a little different, you know, actually after the communists fell apart, it became much more consumer kind of a society. A little same situation happened in the west. What I remember coming first with my movies to France or to the United States, I thought that the audience, which is interested in this kind of a story much wider. Now you really have the last Mohicans in some ways, the distributors who have been doing it. But it can change again, you know, I think it can change with the state of the society, you know? And you know you have the moments when the people want to be cradled, they want to be, you know, put to sleep in some way. They want to be entertained."

And you are looking for some kind of the _ + fears and to your, you know, frustrations. So I don't think that it will be now forever.

He's very ambiguous about what he's doing, and because he's not intellectual, he doesn't have he's very simple man. And, you know, a lot of reason why he decides in this very moment to do what he's doing. But it can change the minute later, so he's like somebody who is who is walking on the rope, the wire, and he can slip in any moment of the side of the good or bad. And in some point, in some point I think he feels and it's because also he wants to look at himself as he is smart or that he can be successful, he does something well. So he feels sometimes the weight of the responsibility. And I think that responsibility has left. That in some way the moment when you are responsible for somebody, it's something which is which created this strong attachment. And for him it becomes a kind of obsession. In some ways he is obsessed by that, like the gambler, you know, at some point he's acting in irrational way. It doesn't make sense what he's doing, you know, it's against his interest. It's against the safety of himself and his family, and also it's against his world of values because no matter for him the Jews, no matter +andnot *paidforit, what the * you know, it means it's interesting to watch it because it's so unpredictable in some way, you know? And I think that it makes this character in some way very real and very symbolic in the same time like, you know, like this kind of the confusion. I think most of the people are going not only during the wartime, but especially in those dangerous circumstances Interview with Agnieszka Holland 12 through the process of the confusion. And at sometimes who decide to do something just by chance, something good, the mystery of the good, you know, how the people are doing acting altruistic. It's quite easy to understand why they're acting in a terrible way, why they are cruel, why they are murderers, but why they are good, you know, I don't know. It is a mystery so, you know, explore this mystery with a character, which is not angelic at all. It's interesting. And also the _+ the people are all stereotypes. He's watching of the Jews in a very stereotype of way, and he expresses it through his language, but the Jews watch him in the same way, you know? They don't watch him as a human being, you know, so they are both in some way mirroring this kind of the judges. And it's very difficult and complicated and it's so much when it breaks. And when it breaks down, suddenly they are naked, you know, they are standing naked Jews standing like, you know, next to the naked _ and they are like looking into the mirror, you know, I thought that, you know that it's actually very touching without being, you know, emotionally judgmental or something."
