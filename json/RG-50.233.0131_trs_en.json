When I got the week wages, th e way I figure, I didn\u2122t have the full amount that was coming to me. Not because she wanted to take it off, to cheat me, but a couple minutes here and a couple minutes there she didn\u2122t figure. So I told the boss, he said, go see my wife. So I went to see her and I told her, this I know, one and two is three. You figure it I said I don\u2122t know and the way I see it, it\u2122s not enough money.

Over there we stopped, the Germans stopped and peopl e knew from there in the town they knew where we\u2122re going. They had an idea where we\u2122re going. So they throw up on the truck some food, bread, Jewish people throwing it. Then th ey took us to a place called, Dzaldowo. Over there was the same story. When we got to the ga te they didn\u2122t let the people get off, they pulled them off, or they hit them and pulled them off. And somehow ther e is a moment which everybody for a moment is for himself. So I saw on the truck ahead of us a young boy like I got to the gate and he jumped off from the side of the truck to avoid their hitting. When my truck came over, I did the same thing. Momentarily, while I jumped off I said to myself what am I doing. I left my father there, so I walked ar ound the truck to the back where they were taking them off, I took him around my hands and I helped them off the truck and they just lightly touched him, and said, go you old dog. They didn\u2122t hit him. That\u2122s how we got to that town Dzaldowo, was a camp and over there we also saw brutality. There was a young man which they hit him, he jumped like crazy, that\u2122s the way they hit him. A couple people got nearly killed. This was, we got there, I think on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I think on a Thursday they took us out and they took us to Chestochowa. Over there we were spread out in the town in different places. There was a ghett o______________ a big ghetto, later on they made a smaller ghetto. At that time it was still th e big ghetto and they located us, Synagogues, community centers and I was fortunate, my parent s were fortunate, because of my father, his personality. When they took us to that place, the first_________ was the streets in__________ like a street. Was a Synagogue in the backyard, wa s a big place, they took us in there and I was bleeded. From Tuesday I wasn\u2122t cared of. The blood was dried up so there came in nurses and doctors came in and helped us and another person from there they saw my father also with the blood so they took him to his apartment. Then in Yaldova we got reunited with my mother and sister and the sister-n-law with the children we got reunited and we got to that place, they took us unto the house, which it was fairly, I mean it was clean. The day they took us to the Synagogue, they put in straw and junk back and that\u2122s where they were laying one on top of the other. While they were cleaning up my h ead wound there was a young girl coming in and helped attend me to clean me up_________. And, so mehow she took an interest in me. This was in March. On May the 15th we got married."

We were given a long, what you call a bunk bed, a long. We were making separations wherever we could to make a separation between one couple and another. Unbelievable as it may sound, it was a truth. We ke pt our dignity as much as possible to keep clean, to keep nice, self -respect. We were t ogether then when they liquidated the big ghetto, which it started on a Yom Kippur day, 1942. At that time we were at the synagogue and we were told that the other end of the city they we re liquidating the ghetto. So we were driven out from there to a smaller place to live.

But I couldn\u2122t do anything and then I got back to the work and they went back and somehow snow came. Then my wife was working in the kitchen there so after awhile, like I said, I was fortunate to be with my wife together, like when it was time when it looked bad, they were trying to take the women out, I went to intervene. Later on when they were trying to take the men away, take me away, she went to intervene. At that time when she wa s working in the kitchen, which it wasn\u2122t too bad, at least we had something to eat, so the forema n like, was a Jewish fellow. There were two brothers and the wife had three sisters. We lived in the ghetto, even before the ghetto, they lived there too. Back to back. So they knew us very well. One of the brothers became the foreman and he want to take away the wife, my wife from the kitchen, take in somebody else. He must have got something from them. So I went to him, my wife went to him, begged him, I\u2122m staying here why are you taking me away? So his wife told my wife how long isn\u2122t enough to be with your husband together? Do you unders tand? That brother gave her hell for it. How could you give her hell for it, how could you say it? But, apparently, time is doing is own course. Later on she got separated from her husba nd and I was with my wife all the time. So then everybody was against it so they made a lo ttery to see who should remain in the kitchen and who not. So, it so happened, my wife was able to remain in the kitchen. Then this was going on while we were still in the small ghett o.

            "question": "Had you heard any rumors about other camps, worse camps?",
            "answer": "We heard rumors that when they had to leave, they liquidate the camps with the people. This we heard later on, the end of \u212244. So, many times I heard like this, my wife asked what\u2122s that, I said it doesn\u2122t look so bad. It made her feel co mfortable. There were twice, two moments, she asked me what\u2122s that? In my wildest imagina tion I couldn\u2122t see anything good, so I said I don\u2122t know. She didn\u2122t ask me anymore. At one time all of a sudden it was at night, they shut off the lights, we were in the factory, we were working the night shift. It was sometime in \u212244, the end of \u212244. What\u2122s that? I said, I don\u2122t know, I couldn\u2122t find anything, I couldn\u2122t find any excuse. Naturally, we thought for the worst. And the se cond time, which it was the last moment before we were liberated, she said, we were driven out to the gates from the factory with the trains were outside and all of a sudden we were pushed back, the whole mess was like pushed back. My wife asked me that time, what\u2122s that? This was when it went through the minds, this is the end. I said I don\u2122t know and she didn\u2122t ask anymore. We held on for a couple of minutes, then we could spread. It got over. What it was, I don\u2122t know. Some people were taken out t the train a the time and the bulk of us remained. There were three other camps in Chestochowa, ammunitions factory. I worked ammunitions fact ory and the day before we were liberated, the day when we were liberated, to me it seems to be the 15 th of January, \u212245. Yeah, I have to go back to a little incident before that. The end of \u212244 we were all mechanics, I was a tailor, but I was a mechanic at the machine. There was one Jewish fellow, he was the main mechanic of those machines. We had there a German boss which it didn\u2122t bother him. He said you don\u2122t bother me, I don\u2122t bother you. I did some tailoring for him I did some fixings for him sometimes. He was foolish, but it didn\u2122t bothe r him any, didn\u2122t do anything wrong. Then they took him away and came in another one. They used to call him the mischugana, the crazy_________. He was crazy, foolish. You coul dn\u2122t talk to him anything, couldn\u2122t talk to him, there was no way. So the boys said let\u2122s tr y to bribe him, maybe we could persuade him to be a little bit. So we did whatever we could to try to bribe him. Whenever he used to pass by my wife when she worked at the machine, so metimes a shell we would find on the floor, or whatever it was he hit her. He passed by, becau se he worked on the same shift and there was another one, he hit her too, but sometimes he gave her a piece of bread too. And this one, whenever I passed by she was crying. One time I passed by she said was it night? She was crying, I said what\u2122s the matter she said I don\u2122t know, everything was going perfect. He hit me with a screwdriver. So I go over to that boy and I said, listen you\u2122re trying to bribe him, at least let him show some decency. Well, he said the slogan was, if not today, it will be tomorrow. Which it meant if we won\u2122t be finished today, we going to be finished tomorrow. As weak as I was I said no, not enough. I don\u2122t buy it. And I find in between two machines, he was a short fellow, he wasn\u2122t taller than me and I went ove r to him and I yelled at him. I said why did you hit my wife for nothing. If you going to hit my wi fe for nothing, hit me, I\u2122ll be able to take a beating, but don\u2122t hit her. And he started bea ting me up. While he was beating me up I was screaming to him the same thing, next time do the same thing, but don\u2122t hit my wife. It\u2122s unbelievable because he didn\u2122t have to take me out to shoot, to kill, he could kill me on the place. But apparently, he didn\u2122t do it and since th en he didn\u2122t touch her again. This was before Christmas time \u212244, about three, four weeks before. Then the 15 th of January in the morning, they didn\u2122t took us out from the barracks. We remained in the barracks. Like normally, we used to go out to work. A day before, the evening before, they took out about 700 people from the shift from the night before. At that time it looked, it didn\u2122t look good. At one time before, like I said I had my sister in Phil adelphia, America, home I never used to write the letters to her. But when the letters used to come she used to live at 633 North 5 th, Philadelphia, Pa., USA. At one time it just him me, came into my mind the address. I used to say it in Polish. I took the address, I wrote down on a piece of paper, just like this. When it looked so bad, I said to my wife, you see, here I give you my sister\u2122s address. If we\u2122ll survive there we\u2122re going to meet. This happened the 15th of January, the 15 th. So in the morning we didn\u2122t go out to work because they took out the night shift the night before. Later on around 9 o\u2122clock or so, 10 o\u2122clock, we had to go out to the appel and stand up in the line and the bosses came around to take us to work. We had one boss which he was fairly a decent man. Unfortunately one time he took, he killed, shoot a woman. Whether he was drunk, it was a little instigation from somebody else and he passed by our group and told us in Germa n, naturally not, it should be noticeable that he is talking to us, to take with you _________ clothes. To take in the factory. Like he knew something, something is going on. So we went in the factory, our group, and while we were in the factory, I took the coat, whatever my wife ha d and mine, put in a room wherever we had to do for the machines, and I\u2122m there for a minute or two minutes, a boy comes in and says, Moishe go out take a look where your wife is. I went out I see her come in from outside. The boss who had the shift before, so he want to keep his women, he want to keep, and send away the others. So she went over to him, it was the 15 th of January, it was cold, she said I want go take mine coat from my husband and I will be back. He said go, but come right back. So naturally I went over to that boss, he knew me, not the one who hit my wife before, but the other one, higher than him, and I told him my wi fe they\u2122re going to take out, do something. He said I\u2122m powerless, there\u2122s nothing I can do. Th ere was, the main engineer from the whole factory there, the ammunitions factory. So the main engineer from the whole factory, in normal times, everybody was afraid for his look. Terrible, terrible man. At that moment he stood with a stick and he was hitting over the head everybody whoever came to him. Why, it was plain and simple. They were trying to take out the people and people were running back. Nobody wants to go away. Everybody wants to stay in the place and they were taking them out and they were running back. So he was hitting everybody over the head, wherever he could. And while he stood with his stick hitting everybody over the head, unbelievable as it may sound, how I did it, I don\u2122t know, but I did something. I went over to him and I said, engineer, I\u2122m here from the first moment when the place started, now they\u2122re goi ng to send out my wife. If they\u2122re going to send her out, I\u2122m going to go with. I scared him off. So he said, where is the boss? He called over the boss, not the one who hit her, but the other one who hit her from time to time, but he gave her a piece of bread too. He said do you know her?. He said yes. Is she a good worker, he said yes. He said remain here. Anothe r boy did the same thing for a girl and she also remained. How I did it, I don\u2122t know. But it wa s a rumor just imagination it was, supposedly you\u2122re supposed to say they should have left his father that the boy should remain here. So somehow I did it and that\u2122s how we remained together. Later on I gave her the address from my sister and said, because it looked like something is going to happen. So I said if we\u2122ll survive, there is going to be a place where we met. O.K. Then we are still in the factory, we were going to lunch to bring the pot with the lunch and that time I went to the kitchen to bring in the lunch for the group. Then we got a lunch and I sat do wn on the floor near the machine, while I was sitting eating we heard some banging, to bang a big factory. So I didn\u2122t pay too much attention after awhile another repeat, didn\u2122t pay attention yet, but then it didn\u2122t took long another few minutes we heard more banging. So I said that time to my wife, because she was sitting with me near the machine, I said now I\u2122ll put away the food what I had, let\u2122s pay attention what\u2122s going on. So after awhile we saw the Germans th rough the window, we could see that they start running. Then one of the German bosses came in and he said to the other one, he said what\u2122s going on with you don\u2122t you see what\u2122s doing outside already? Stop the work. So they stopped the work and we were driven out to the barracks. There was a factory_________, a munitions factory, a bigger one than ours. When the Russians came close to that__________ they evacuated the factory and it took about six months till the Russi ans came in that time. So they were told, the rumors were going on, the Germans said they were supposed to leave the factory with the people. The factory should be able to go till the last minute, cause it was a bigger factory than ours. This apparently what they di d. In our place, in our situation the factory was running until the last minute. But still we were afraid that they\u2122ll tear off the bounty (?) place with the people. This was the thought what it ma y happen. This is what they did in some other places. So we were in the barracks and around it starts to get dark already, one of the Germans came in with a sack of bread giving out bread. So whoever could reach it got bread. Then the commander from the camp start to go around and cal ling the people said to go with him. He said I was for you like a father, come with me, the Russians are coming, come with me. And unfortunately, a couple h undred people went up."

Around 10 o\u2122clock the fi re engines, the fire people from the fire engine company they came around and told us now you are free, just watch out from upstairs from the planes. It was only a wild dream to be able, I don\u2122t know whether I even identify, but subconsciously there was some kind of hope in th e back of the conscience that maybe, maybe. This was the moment what we heard, now you are free just watch out from the top. So I still had my can with my lunch and it was cold. So some people did smart things. They were going around in the German homes and did whatever they could do, take whatever they could. "

Talking ab out the friend of mine I have to go back a little while to memorialize him, cause he just passed away and we were very good friends. He too was a tailor and while we were in the camps in the same barracks we used to make caps by hand, little caps be able to wear it. And my wife, if she could find a potato, she cooked something, so whenever she cooked something, whatev er I ate, I fall asleep. He used to say, go ahead, go to sleep I\u2122ll finish it. And that\u2122s what we did, we liv ed very close together.

Unfortunately, very few pe ople survived that camp. She was there with four children, a son and a daughter in that camp where my sister was in another place of work, the same camp, another two daughters. That da ughter that she was with was doing tailoring. She was working for the Germans. One time she found out it\u2122s going to be a selection to take up people. So being my sister was an elderly woman then, white, grey hair, so she said to her mother, Mom, go hide yourself because there\u2122s go ing to be a selection they\u2122re going to take up people. So my sister listened and she hid herself. Fortunately from that particular group where they were, they didn\u2122t took up anybody. So, it was good. A while later she comes back again and says Mom, go hide yourself they\u2122re going to take up people again a selection. So my sister says, nah, they didn\u2122t take then th ey\u2122re not going to take now either. She didn\u2122t want it. It so happens they took out my sister. So the two kids went over to Mom and said, Mom, where you\u2122re going, we are going. Mom started to beg them said, me, all right, it\u2122s me, I\u2122m elderly already, so you\u2122re still young you still have a chance. They said no, where you go, we go. The other two kids they couldn\u2122t reach because they were a different place of work. So what happened, those few people what they took out they sent them to a different camp, the remain bulk of the people they all got wiped out. That\u2122s how she remained alive with the two children."

If I had to take the bus in my corn er, I went over to the next corner to go in the store, she had a cleaning store, to say good morning and took the bus. Sometimes it happened I was late and I got the bus right at the corner I couldn\u2122t go i n, she came up to the house, the apartment, to see what happened. That \u2122s how close we were all the years."

When it came in a telegram from the boat I was coming in here, I sent a telegram to my sister that we are on the way because she sent to us the papers. And it was on a Sunday when the telegram arrived, the letter carrier brought in the telegram and the boy was 14, 15 years old. So he gave the letter carrier two dollars. Because the parents weren\u2122t home.. Then when they came home, he said came in a telegram from Moishe. That\u2122s it, they were happy. Did you give him something? He said yes, I gave him two dollars. They said two dollars! He said isn\u2122t it worth it?"

The day when we arrive d, we came into Ellis Island, no, we stood around Ellis Island overnight, we didn\u2122t get off the shi p, because we arrived a Sunday night. I think it was a Sunday night. We stood a distance away. In the morning they came into New York, into New York Port. Right into the port. When we got off the ship and the port went through all the formalities, the paper work, I started to look around. Was a huge hall, a huge building. But somehow I looked around and I set my eyes to a co rner. I said to my wife, you see this is my sister. We didn\u2122t see each other since 1929. But we got pictures. I said you see, this is my sister and we start raising hands. It took a wh ile, she came down with her sister-in-law for us. It was my sister. Like we could feel from the distance that\u2122s a sister and brother."

                " Anything else to add? Yes. There were time s which we couldn\u2122t talk about the Holocaust. I think that most of us came to the conclusion we should talk about, we should tell about what we lived through and the world population with few exceptions stood silent, callously silent, to the annihilation of six million Jewish people. Amon g them a million and a half children. Children which they never had a chance to see the world with its beauty what they taste the tyranny of the people. We should talk about, especially now , they are so called educators, they are so called educators that they are denying the Holocaust. They say it only in our imagination. Things like this never happened. How kind of vultures can I say those people are. They denying the existing of us survivors who went through hell and they know about, but still they are denying it. We should remember, we rememb er, we should never let the people forget what we Jews went through, other Nations too, but there is a differen ce between us Jews and other Nations. We were annihilated for one reason and for one reason only. Just because we were Jews. There was said this Hitler may he rest in hell, wherever he is, said, if he\u2122ll find a Jew in 1945, he is going to kiss his head. Thank G-d there are Jews survived him, there is Israel which hopefully will exist and he is in hell wherever he is. We a long accounting to do with people. So called friends. We hoped that the world will realize and help Israel, the Jewish Nation live in peace. Unfortunately, so- called friends are doing ve ry little to help Israel in peace. But let\u2122s hope we are out making people hopefully will exis t for many years to come. And I thank you Anthony Di Iorio. I thank you for coming into th e house and telling my story of life. Maybe it\u2122s not so_______ but it\u2122s a story of life which we went through. Many people may say, why didn\u2122t you fight back? But there is a saying that it is always good to be a quarterback next day after the game. Unfortunately, this was the story with us. There were very few which were able to fight back, to resist. The greatest resistan ce from the people was to exist and try to conduct as humanely as you could with all the bad luck situations where we lived, conditions where we lived, and we resisted to be able to exist and I think this is the greatest resistance what every human being could do. And I thank you again for coming. You had a long day. Q; Thank you for having me. I probably should say for those who will hear this tape that hard necking people, we should say that means stubborn and tough. ",
                " Right, right. I just couldn\u2122t bring out the proper word for it. There is the Hebrew translation for it, Em shay oraf, the heart necking stubborn people. With all the humiliation that we had we still were able to bring up a second generation nice young people who do take an active part to keep up the Holocaust memory and the memory of th e grandparents that they had lost. It\u2122s very heartwarming for those youngsters to be. "
