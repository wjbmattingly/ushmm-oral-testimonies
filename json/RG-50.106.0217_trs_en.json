I had to pass an entrance exam to get in. and I was very tempted to cheat but not for the good, but for, so I didn\u2122t have to go. But I passed it and I lived with friends of my parents. In Vienna. I really didn\u2122t want to go. I was kind of a home body. And these people I lived with were very nice. They were not Jewish. They had a daughter, a little bit older than myself.

            "answer": "Exactly , 38. And nothing much is happening and now we go right through until November 10th. And we\u2122re in school and we went, as I said, home to lunch every day to Tante Olga, Lily\u2122s mom. And we\u2122re going to lunch and it is very cold. And we\u2122re getting there and the door is open and a window is open. Sometimes she used to open a window to air it out but always close it and all that. And we walked in and Lily ca lls mama. No answer. Again we\u2122re running through the house, mama, mama. Nobody there. And I\u2122m yelling Tante Olga where are you. We are home for lunch. We only have half an hour. No answer. Lily and I look at each other. Something\u2122s not right. I said what do we do? She said I know the Tikler family here in town, another Jewish family. Why do n\u2122t we go there? Something\u2122s happened. So ok we started going down the street, when all of a sudden across from us, we\u2122re walking straight and perpendicular comes what we call the green Henry. It was a green police wagon. And in it is her father. And we s ee this and my uncle just waved goodby. And then we just were so scared. And we started running and we get to the Tikler house and they\u2122re all women, no men gathered in that house. And we said to my aunt, and she said what happened. How come we didn\u2122t know where we were, where you were. She said I didn\u2122t have time. They came and chased me out. And they wouldn\u2122t even let me leave a note or go get you so what is going on. Well nobody told us anything. The women were there and they were all very upset. An old woman who was uh, and babies. I mean there must have been ten or 12 people. Where\u2122s my mother? We don\u2122t know. So I said I\u2122m going home. Oh you can\u2122t go alone. So Lily said I\u2122ll go with you cause I will. You can\u2122t stop me now. Now I\u2122m getting independent. (laughs) So Lily and I start walking. And the distance was maybe a mile from where we were to my home. In Wiesenfeld. We get about half way. I see a bicyclist coming towards us. There was minimal traffic at that time. Nobody had a car, you know. It was, so here comes a bicycle rider. Even that was a big deal. Come closer. Who is it? My mother. She said papa is in jail. Where\u2122s Eric? He\u2122s in jail. Oh god. And uncle Isadore. We just saw him go by. They must have taken him to Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16, 2014 15 jail. What happened? A Jewish kid, my mother is saying. Come on, let\u2122s go. I\u2122m going to take you back to the Tiklers. We\u2122re all going to be together. The story was and everybody has heard the story. A Jewish kid killed a Nazi official and we\u2122re ok. Everybody paid I don\u2122t know how many marks. Plus being in prison. So that\u2122s what that day was Kristal night. They took my father into a jail in some other town, and my brother and they were sitting there and my mother. They were taking my mother too. But my mother, if you want to know somebody feisty, she was, she said you\u2122re not keeping me. You can shoot me first. You\u2122re not keeping me here. I got to go get my daughter. She didn\u2122t do anything. She\u2122s 11 years old. What. And they said ok, go, go, go. So that\u2122s how she got ou t. So we went back to the house and all the women. Uh, what are we going to and kvetching and crying and my mother said. You know what . We don\u2122t have time for this. We better sit down here and think about what to do. So perhaps we could find, she just made things up to keep them busy, to get some clothes together. Or get whatever we need. Get some suitcases. Maybe do whatever we have to do, even if the suitcases are empty. Just, you never know what we have to do. And they said ok and they, I don\u2122t kno w what they did. But by that time things were coming towards supper time. And my mother said now maybe we could find something to eat. Could make a sandwich. Have some fruit. And so we all did that. They did that. And now it\u2122s getting later and later a nd now there is a banging on the door. Must have been eight, nine o\u2122clock at night. Open. Open up. It\u2122s the Gestapo. So everybody is cowering. My mom close to the door and she said yes. And he said how many of you are there. And my mother said I don\u2122t know. And get out. So my mother said what do you mean get out. You get out in the street all of you. Now. You can grab what you can and go and so people who had been futzing around and looking for clothes. They had stuff and they had a coat and whatever we had. And we were on the street now. It\u2122s cold. Quite cold. My mother says what are you going to do with us? We decided. There were three of them. You are going into that factory that\u2122s a few streets, I don\u2122t recall where exactly. Was an empty fact ory. And they were going to put us in there and we were to stay there. And this was a cement floor and nothing else. So we get there and all of a sudden, my mother stops and she said to them, excuse me, sir. I want to a, tell you something. And he said yes, what do you want? She said when we were young and I lived in that house where Lily lives now, and my aunt. I used to live here and you used to come to the back door and ask for me and when I came out, you tried to kiss me. And he Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16, 2014 16 said to her. Shut up. She said but you did. What if I spoke very loud and everybody would know that you, a Nazi officer, kissed a Jewish girl. And he said if you don\u2122t shut up, I\u2122m going to send you and the kid to Dachau. Meaning me. She said that\u2122s very good officer. You can send me and my kid but before you do, I\u2122m going to scream it all over this town that you tried to kiss a Jewish girl. He said what the hell do you want? She said all I want is to take these people instead of putting us into the factory, to my home in W iesenfeld. I have a big house and we can stay there. And of course they argued. And they can\u2122t do that and who do you think you are. And she said ok, it\u2122s your choice but I can scream. And I thought he\u2122d shoot her right there. Go ahead, he says. Take them and go. I have to laugh at her. Cause she said but it\u2122s so cold. We can\u2122t just walk. We\u2122ve got this old lady and a baby. And he just he was getting crazy, this man. And the other officials heard him say what does she want? She can\u2122t walk. She says I want a truck and they said get her a damn truck. They got a truck. They loaded us on. They got us a driver and they got us a bodyguard with a machine gun or whatever. And they drove us to my parents\u2122 house. So she saved the day. Now it took some time to find out what happened to my aunts and uncles. And for my father to be released and in the meantime, while we were all mulling around in my big house, my mother sent a telegram to a cousin we had here in the United States. My cousin. It was my mother\u2122s niece who married an American physician. And this physician had gone to Vienna years before in the 20s, to study at the University of Vienna. And"

So they sent Eric an affidavit and to make a long story short, they let Eric out. And this was maybe December now. Kristal night was November. So December. And he was able to get a Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16, 2014 17 visa and a passport to come to the United States and he came alone.

One woman was my mother\u2122s washerwoman. And she risked her life to come to do whatever she could do. She even brought bread. She thought we were starving. But before that I forgot to put this very important element in. Right after the Anschluss not much time passed when a Nazi officer came to my house. And I happened to be \u0152 it was a two story house. And downstairs was the kitchen and a dining room. My father\u2122s office, his business. Upstairs were bedrooms and a music room. And I had a baby grand piano. And an old fashioned bathroom. We did not have running water. We had a beautiful home but there was no running water yet. My mother wanted to institute that and hadn\u2122t gotten around to it and blah, blah, blah. So. This Nazi officer came to the door and said -- I was alone. Where\u2122s your mother. And I said she\u2122s upstairs. Take me. so I take him and I called her and I said, Mupik , somebody to see you. She comes out. He says to her, where\u2122s your piano. She said, show me. so she shows him. It will be taken within the hour. And my mother said, what? What do you mean, it\u2122ll be taken within the hour. He said don\u2122t you know yet, l ady, that Jews are not allowed to have anything of value. And she is thinking that this is a joke. And he said now I\u2122m going to give you a chance. Make a decision. It\u2122s either you or the piano. They were going to take either the piano or they\u2122ll take he r. Now what do you do? Even when you are feisty. You can\u2122t stop that.

Dr. Mr. Wellisch, the president has been made aw are of your situation and has directed me to tell you what to do and how you can get your parents out. And it had to be a farmer\u2122s visa because the United States had a quota, didn\u2122t let everybody in. But if you were, knew anything about agriculture, you had a chance. Luckily my father owned a farm. I\u2122ve got pictures over there. I can show you later. He owned the farm right in Wiesenfeld. It was a big farm. He owned it but he didn\u2122t run it. Somebody else who ran it, but papa was t he kind of man who was well informed about everything. He owned the farm. He knew about farming. He knew about lumber and everything that he did, he was well informed about you know. So my brother was able to communicate to papa to apply for a farmer\u2122s visa. To make a long story short, he got it, but it took from January or February until the end of August for us to get out. We lived under the Hitler regime for a long, long time and things were getting harder and harder. But he did get the farmer\u2122s visa. And he was able to have enough money to have transportation for us to come to the Uni ted States and the ship we were on was called the Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16, 2014 21 Volendam .

            "answer": "Took the train to Vienna and my father\u2122s aunt was there at the train station. And I don\u2122t remember much about anybody else but she was there because she was my very favorite aunt. And she hugged me and she said you should be very happy. You know why. I said why should I be so happy ? She said not only because you\u2122re getting away from here but because you won\u2122t Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16, 2014 24 have to go to school on Saturday in America. (laughs) and we cried and she said my darling I don\u2122t think I\u2122ll ever see you again. And I never did. So we got on that train. When we get to the border the Gestapo comes on. Checking papers . Come to papa. Papers, passport, takes the papers, walks away and brings another officer and says there\u2122s something wrong here. Get off the train. Take the kid, take your wife. Get off. We had to get off. The train goes away. That was hell. They took my father into an office and they told my mother and me to sit and wait and we sit and we wait. And train after train is coming and going. Our train long gone. No Papa. Now what. I said to my mother I think we\u2122re going to die. And she pushed and she said we are not dying. I, if I have anything to do with these guys we (laughs). They could have killed her more than once. She had a mouth and I mean it was about three or four hours later when Papa came out . We can go. What happened? They did not believe that he knew anything about farming. Because he was a businessman. And they brought in a knowledgeable agricultural expert who gri lled him for two hours about cows and milk and what have you. And Papa thank God, he knew the answers. He was well informed about everything. And they finally had to, well they didn\u2122t have to let him go but they let him go. So we got on the next train and went to Rotterdam. And they met the Jewish committees and even the Dutch people. They met every train coming from Germany. And they put us up in private homes, in hotels. Wherever there was room and we were put up. At first I think it was a hotel. We didn\u2122t stay long because the ship was leaving anyway but they treated us like royalty. They were so kind, the Dutch people. And when we did finally get on that ship it was of course, the Volendam, a Dutch ship, Dutch crew and they treated the immigrants beautifully. And I remember having to eat brick ice cream three times a day. They brought this ice cream. And to this day if you show me brick ice cream I will ugh. (laughs) And we got here \u0152"

Horrible stories that my family suffered like so many others. So any way, this is interesting. We come on the Volendam, right. Took us I think almost two weeks because we found out later from the captain that the ocean was mined. And he was trying to figure out what the best \u0152 where would the Germans not put a mine. So that\u2122s why, luckily you know we avoided that. The Volendam went from New York to I believe Cuba with some refugees. Dropped them off. Went back. And that\u2122s all I ever knew. And after I was here and married already, my brother in law took us to a very fancy restaurant in New York. It was some kind of celebration and he took my husband and me and he and his wife and, and each table almost had their own waiter. It was a bit much. They come and put the napkin on your lap and the, and I\u2122m not you know, and thi s one waiter said , spoke with an accent. And he was very nice and very courteous and I said so where are you from. And he said I\u2122m from Holland and I said you know your people are wonderful. And he said oh madam, do you know anything about Holland? And I said well I\u2122ll just tell you briefly. We came from Austria through Germany. And your people helped us and he said oh yes. He said may I ask you what ship. And I said the Volendam. And he said oh, almost like Oh. I said are you ok? And he said at that time I was a crew m ember on the Volendam. And we had a trip to Cuba and on the way back we hit a mine and all my crew members died. I am one of the very few survivors. And I said I think that\u2122s the end of my dinner. I can\u2122t, can you \u0152 That was quite a \u0152 so that was one of the stories that made me very sad but I said I\u2122m so glad you\u2122re alive so.

But I had to go to school. And I was admitted to first, to sixth grade. Now here I am 13 now. So I am the oldest in the classroom. And the children were very nice to me. And the teacher explained \u0152 her name was Mrs. Sacks, a Jewish lady , that Trudy has just come from another country and she was trying to put a little history in there to tell the kids why this is happening. Why I\u2122m here. And they were listening and very polite and very sweet and can I help you and all that. So the teacher said you don\u2122t have to do anything, to me. Just listen to the language. And I\u2122m listening and I guess I\u2122m learning. And three months passed by and she said we\u2122re having a vocabulary test today. We\u2122re going to have a hundred words and I raised my hand and she said yes. I said could I try it. And she said yes. I got a hundred.

To make a long story short, he applied and he got it. Got a scholarship to Hopkins. Came for an interview and the dean, whoever interviews, said we have these two scholarships, specifically for immigrants. So that\u2122s the good news. You are definitely in. You want to hear the bad news. And Eric thought oh God. You know I\u2122ve had enough bad news but what\u2122s the bad. He said you have to do it in three years, not four. And Eric said so what. That\u2122s not bad news. I can do that. So he said to him, if you think you can do it in three years, you\u2122re in. What would you like to study? And Eric said law. Man leans back. He said Eric, I don\u2122t think so. You have such an accent you\u2122ll never make it as a lawyer. Pick something else. S o Eric said well ok, I\u2122ll be a chemist. That\u2122s what he became.

And he was taken away and sent to Dachau. And she was left alone with her baby. In Vienna. And the Nazis said to her, if you can get yourself out of here, I\u2122ll let him out and he can go with you. Let\u2122s get him out. And so she starts going from one embassy to another embassy. Ends up at the Bolivian embassy, gets permission and they really let him out. It\u2122s now a few days before departure and the kid gets scarlet fever and they can\u2122t go. So now you start this whole thing again. But she was smart. She said I might as well go to the Bolivian embassy and tell them what has happened. Maybe they\u2122ll \u0152 and they did. But it took time. You know everything takes time. In the meantime the Nazis come and take this and fina lly they\u2122re able to go by ship to Cochabamba Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16, 2014 33 which is the second largest city in Bolivia. They get there. I don\u2122t know how long it took. Heinz, the little boy, who is now 76, still living in Vienna, whom I saw a few years ago, so they\u2122re on that ship and they\u2122re getting to Cochabamba and it\u2122s on the weekend. And Richard says I do not feel well. And all the immigrants are in that camp. That\u2122s where the refugees had to go to an immigration center. And they said oh that happens all the time because the altit ude is very difficult on people. You\u2122ll be ok. Richard wasn\u2122t ok. He got worse, but there was no doctor available on the weekend. He had to wait until Monday and he\u2122s getting a fever and a lot of pain. Finally Monday comes. Richard can\u2122t talk anymore, he \u2122s in so much pain. The doctor says you have a burst appendix. We\u2122ve got to go quick. They get him to the hospital, put him on the table and he died. So she can\u2122t get out with the little boy. She didn\u2122t know what to do and that\u2122s where my father\u2122s comm unication began. At least to somebody. She had no idea what happened to any, any of the family. Until much later on we found out. Eric found out. My cousins, they were all in Th eresienstadt , most of them. And Eric found her. This is my Aunt Elsa, the one who met me at the train station, said you don\u2122t have to, her daughter was in T heresienstadt , survived and but she was deathly ill. And Eric found her, found her in Vienna, after and saw how sick she was. She had TB. She had kidney disease. She had, you name it. And he arranged it for her to go to a sanatorium in Switzerland. Until she got well. So he was able to save her and her husband whom she met in Theresienstadt. He was a roofer. His name was Alexander Bernot . He was in Theresienstadt and he saw Anna scrounging around for some food and they got a little bit. He tried to help her. H e was a roofer in Vienna. He did most of the roofs of the big, like St. Stephen\u2122s and he was \u0152 and so the Nazis used him to fix the roof here and there. They didn\u2122t care if the water dripped down on the inmates, but they wanted their roofs to be free from rainwater and all that. So he did that so he had a little access to more things. And then the rumor came that the war is coming to an end and Americans or British bombers are going to bomb. So the inmates said so now we\u2122re going to, we survived this. Now we\u2122re going to get killed by \u0152 he climbed up on the roof of the barracks, with red paint. And he painted red crosses on the roofs. If he had been caught he would have been dead. But the thing was that some of these roofs leaked and the red paint dripped on some of the prisoners. They had no way to get rid of it and some of the Nazis saw them and they thought they had some kind of terrible disease. They ran. (laughs) Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16, 2014 34"

He\u2122s in Chicago. But Michael is dead. So that\u2122s when I get angry and I\u2122m saying isn\u2122t it enough he had to lose this child. Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16, 2014 43 I went back to school after I took this national exam. I did go back and I got a degree in libera l arts."

We had a reunion. I didn\u2122t recognize any \u0152 one I recognized and she had been corresponding. She is the one who set it up, but I didn\u2122t know the rest, except for this young man who\u2122s now 88, who lived across the street from us. And we were alwa ys together. We were in school and I always liked him you know. And he said we should meet again in Vienna as long as you were here. And well, the very first time, before the \u0152 I was going to the reunion but he left a message with my cousin, the one my br other rescued that I should call him.

I would like to meet you for breakfast tomorrow at nine AM at such and such you know. So I said ok. He came with a dozen yellow roses, handso me as can be and that was the first time I\u2122ve seen him. He was a, an American POW, served in the German army and told me he had to join the Nazi party because they all did. Most of the men and women.

They took away my education that I could have had. They took away my home. They took away life. Not my personal life, but life. Yeah. And I don\u2122t know how other people feel but I have no qualms about it. And if they paid me millions of dollars, they would not bring back Lily. Or Tante Elsa or Tante Olga or any of them. Uncle Ludwig, who was a jolly, jolly man. Always had a good sense of humor. Loved kids, never had any of his own. Was sent to Dachau. Came back a broken man. And one day he went downstairs. He never left his seat, didn\u2122t want to go anywhere, do anything and his brother my uncle Isadore was coming to visit him and all of a sudden he says to his wife, le t\u2122s go meet him downstairs and she thought he\u2122s snapping out of it. Oh yeah. So he says to her. Y ou wait at the front door and I\u2122ll go to the back door. Fine. Never saw him again. She\u2122s standing at the door. He\u2122s never coming. They found his coat on the edge, on the banks of the Danube. Now what, does it take a genius to figure out what, he just couldn\u2122t take it. What did they do to him? So should you not be angry? But you can\u2122t live it all the time, you know. It would make you do something to myself. I wouldn\u2122t be a good mother. I wouldn\u2122t be a good grandmother. You can\u2122t live that way. But I think about it almost every day about some aspect. Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16, 2014 45"
