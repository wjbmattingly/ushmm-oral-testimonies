            "question": "Maybe we can stay a little bit with your family before we go on. You said both of your parents were professionals. Could you say a little bit more about which profession and give a little bit more of the sense of your house, what did you do, your ,",
            "answer": "Well, as | mentioned before, my father was a pharmacist. My father was from a very poor but religious family, and he was a self-made man who really made himself what he was and was very well looked upon by the members of the family. He was a pharmacist and at this time he suffered already because he was Jewish pharmacist, because in 1933, when everything started to brew in Nazi Germany, in Poland the anti-Semitism grew very rapidly. At this time, he was working in a government very big pharmacy. He was told that he cannot work there anymore, that he has to have a different degree, he has to have a Master in Pharmacy. So you went and you studied very hard and finally he had this degree in Master of Pharmacy. Even when a very anti-Semitic professor was giving him a very harsh time, he went to the exam, answered all the difficult questions, and when he was coming out, the professor said, \u201cBy the way Masure(ph), what is the formula for oxygenated water?\u201d you know, and he was so full of the complicated formula, then he went blank, and then he had to study again and go to Warsaw and finally he got this Master degree, but it took maybe six months later. Then those three Jewish pharmacists that worked in this government big pharmacy were taken out and were told that Jews cannot work in a government job because it was not fit for them. It was a very big tragedy for us and my father was very, very unhappy, but, with the help of other members of the family and his friends, he was able to buy a pharmacy in 1938 but imagined that, since he was Jew, he had no right to buy it so he had to pay a Polish pharmacist, and | remember his name was Dischemsky(ph), and he bought the pharmacy in Solie(ph). So, we were living in Vienna(ph), and my father was commuting and going to Solie. But, there was, my mother was a dentist and my parents meet at the University of St. Petersburg when they were student and it took them quite a while till they had the means to get married. My mother was very beautiful women and that only was a very good professional. The best day of the week for us was Friday because this was the date that she wasn't working. And, | remember the pride that | felt when | was working from the street and | never saw my mother without their hat and a pair of gloves; and strange men used to tip their hat and say how beautiful she is, a princess. So, | was very proud of her, and not only was | very proud of her but my mother was my best friend. | could talk to her very open, she was a very alterault(ph) and gentle soul and she did a lot of deeds when | was never told about, but unfortunately she, a women who was beautiful and good, contracted cancer, and May 24, 1939, she passed away. This was a very big defense(ph) tragedy, a very big tragedy for me. And, | remember working on the street and the sun was shining and | said to myself, \u201cMy mother is not here and the world is going on and the birds are singing and the beautiful lilacs are blooming and she\u2019s not here.\u201d It was a very, very, bad loss for me. And, me and my sister were left two little orphans, there were a lot of other women that were very keen to be our mother because my mother was only 40 years old when she died. But, my father and my mother always took us to all kinds of concert, children play, operettas; when | was six years old, my father took me to the library, my mother asked him to do it, and since then, a new world opened for me because | was . And, also, a very important part of our life was my nanny because she was taking us, especially me because | was older, (I\u2019m four years older than my sister, Rachel) was taking me to the park. When | was going to the park, | had to get dressed and | had to wear white gloves and if my nanny decided that my clothes were not proper, she was to go to the store, we had an account, she used to order material for the dress, she used to go to the dress maker and then, after awhile, when the bill came to my father, my father used to say this women will ruin me, but she was the only one who\u2019s no afraid of him and she was saying to him, \u201cDo you think this is right, that our two little girls, who look like paupers? How, what would the other nannies in the park say?\u201d So, my father was a patafanilias(ph), you know, very good but stern and his word was, even, was, | mean, he had to just to look at you and we knew what he meant and his word was going . And my mother, many times, she was also a bread winner but she was intimidated but my nanny stood her ground and she was saying to my mother, \u201cThe little girls have to bend to be little ladies\u201d and so | had the very, very, pampered childhood and very good childhood. | loved my parents and they really gave me the best that they could."

My sister was not a too good student and she didn't like the except she liked pretty dresses, like that, but she had no obligation to be a very good student because my father decided that she is going to marry a well-to-do person, a professional who will take very good care of her. So, it was always understood that | was the serious one and she was the little woman, and we accepted it, of course, we didn\u2019t have big fight but sometimes little fights like who, we had braids, who the nanny, who should braid the hair before, me or her? And, little, little, things, but it was always put in my mind that | am the oldest one and | have to take care of her."

And, | really didn\u2019t even so much know that | was Jewish but, later on, we lived in, very close to, the university and there were riots in, near the medical faculty, because the Jewish students attended the faculty, were suppose to sit on the left. So instead of them sitting on the left, they was standing up and taking notes and when the riots were occurring and the nanny used to pick me up from school, and | heard, and then | was very much aware of my father\u2019s suffering. My mother had a lot of Polish patience and she had a very good reputation that she was taking out, doing extraction, taking out teeth, and very big, tall, well-to-do, landowners used to come with their horse and buggies and the driver used to wait for them and they to go up to my mother, kiss her hand, and bring us fresh strawberries and all this kinds and she didn\u2019t hear it.

The Poles were very anticipated(ph) and they told that all there misfortunes were caused by those people that were taking away everything from them, that those people were well to do, that those people were not telling the true, but the truth is that there were a lot, a lot, very poor Jews. There was a whole section in my town, Vienna(ph), where there was such a poor Jews living in cellars, the children were dying from tuberculosis and all the related sicknesses; but, | was always brought up with the mind that charity\u2019s very important. We always had boxes for orphan children, we always had a box to help Israel. Even my parents were not, this times ; And, when my mother passed away, she had a very big funeral and a lot of people that | didn't know that exist, came over to me and told me that even she had a very big practice, all the poor people, from all around who knew, that they can come to the dentist, Gutalip Carich Masur(ph), in the middle of the night, she will take care of them and she will never, never, ask them for money. When | was in concentration camp, | meet a woman who was working in the kitchen, and she a little bit more bread, and she came over to me and she gave me one potato and piece of bread, and she says to me, \u201c! am one of those patients that your mother helped\u201d and, you know, it was in very bad taste, in my mother's circle, if you did something good, you never tell it, you never brag about it.

            "question": "And then the second major in your life was in 1941 when the invasion came, the Polish invasion came?",
            "answer": "No, no, no. The second one was September 1, 1939, when the Germany raided Poland; because, as it happens, this time, it was summertime, and | was in Solie(ph) where my father had the pharmacy. It was a very small town, maybe 20 minutes by train from Genow(ph). And, me and my sister were in Solie(ph) on vacation. And, also, | have to mention that after my mother passed away, my mother had an older sister, her name was Sonya Lickowvitchpersky(ph), who was a registered nurse and a mid-wife; and she became our second mother. She was always very close with us because those two sisters were very close and apparently my mother, on her death bed, asked her to take care of her two little girls, so she became our second mother, and she spend, sometimes summertime, she went there to Solie(ph) with us and then she left us and went back to her husband in Vienna(ph) where was her residence, she didn\u2019t have children. And, so, on September 1, | was in Solie(ph) and, as it happens, there was a pact made. Vienna(ph) became a part of Lithuania and Solie became a part of White Russia. SO we were, we're now only with our father and we were separated from our second mother and it was just terrible, but our whole life was up-side-down, from this time, because when the Russian came to Solie, you know, the first thing what they did, they said that my father is a rich man. They called him bourgeois and they didn\u2019t give him a passport and he was now like an enemy of the people. Even he, he didn't do anything to..., he was working very hard to be an owner, he was considered persona-nongratta(ph) and | couldn\u2019t go to school in Solie because there was no high school and | just started go to high school, so | was sent to a town called Dushanitover(ph) was the high school and my father rented a room there and | attended this school and | was always, always, separated from my sister, was staying with my father in Solie(ph) because there was a grammar school there. So there very, very, big upheaval and | was studying there \u2018til 1941. | visited once, my aunt, and | had other family, my aunt, my second and that was in Vienna(ph) and | had all the, two cousins. Because my father arranged somehow to gave a permission during the vacation, to come to visit them. And, when | came there and stayed with my Aunt, | was looking for my friends from my school, and it was a complete division, my school, my beloved school...the children couldn't go there because they had to learn Lithuanian and some of them went to the Polish school. It was a big, big, upheaval in our young life. So when | came back, | was heartbroken because everything that was dear to me was kind of destroyed. But, then came June, 1941...this was when the German army came to our town, but before they came, | wanted to tell you that my father was thrown out from, by the Russian, from the pharmacy, and he was made a manager in a little town called Astroegetts(ph), so they had to move there. And, of course, he was very disappointed, but he was trying to do his best and he became very friendly with a young doctor that was living just near us, and this was actually in his only companion because the cultural level of the town people were very low. So here | am in Astroegetts(ph), | just came for vacation, it was June, and I\u2019m sitting and reading a book, and | remember what book | was reading...| was reading the book in Russian and it was by the son of Tolstoy and it was about Peter the Great. And, | am sitting and reading the book and they are describing, describing the banquette with all kinds of exotic food that they are giving and they are talking about black grapes, that | never saw in my life in Poland within and they are talking about peaches that | never saw and here | am reading this book and the maid came running from the pharmacy and saying \u201cYour father wants you right away, the German invaded and they are coming to our town.\u201d We were strangers in Astorgetts(ph)...we just couldn't make friends in such a short time so we didn\u2019t have, like, roots there. When | cam running, there was a truck standing with Russian doctors and Russian nurses who were good friends of my father and they asked my father we should go on the truck and they will take us to Russia. And, my father took me and my sister into the room and said, \u201cMy children, during the war, a person has to have a roof over their head, a roof is very important. | know the German invited us when we were in Poland and some how they were even so | don't believe that they will do any harm to me, after all, | am a law-abiding person and | am professional.\u201d So, we were standing there...as soon as the Russian left, in a few more hours, the maid of the young doctor, there was a friend of my father came running up and said that the doctor told me to tell you there will be a program (you know what is a program) tonight and since you are the most prominential in this town, you will be the first one. So he said, \u201cLeave everything and go someplace, because you will be killed.\u201d There was a rabbi in the town, so my father went to the rabbi and told him and the rabbi said, \u201cOkay, you stay here.\u201d And, low and behold, this night was a very big program...we heard it. There were peasant(ph) with those big things that you clean the street, | forgot how to say it in English..."

So, the next day, in the morning, we came out and we went to our house and one of the well-to-do Polish people, that went __, was also persecuted by a Russian, came to my father and said that \u201cl will take your belongings and you come to me because, and you were good to me and | will help you out and he had a very big, not a palace, a very big farm house and a lot of landing(ph). So, my father and my sister took a baggy and put some belongings and ended up going there and | was sitting in the house with other belongings. On the way, the Poles with rakes saw them and took everything away, put my father against the tree, and shot him...and my little sister was ten (sp), or maybe 12 years old, something, saw it...and grazed his right hip, he didn't shot in to(ph) but grazed, and his arm was...and they were moved along.

            "question": "Interview with Lily Mazur(ph) Margules, conducted by on August 2/, 1996, at Lily's home in the Bronx, New York. This is tape one, side B.",
            "answer": "Still today, | don't know if it was staged, that he wanted to rob us, this Pole, or it was just, just one of those things that the peasants were wild and they were, they just attacked him. So there | was sitting and |, when | saw my father all bloody and there is, there are no word that | can describe you, but | was very concerned because my little sister became very hysterical and she couldn't cry because we had to be very quiet. Our life was in danger. So we left everything that we had there, all our goods, and we went again to the Rabbi. And in the morning, somehow, my father contacted a peasant and gave him a sum of money and he, asked him to take us to Vilna to my aunt. After my father came with this, all bleeding, something happened to my dog, Rex. He was so attached to us, he was like a member of my family. When my mother passed away, he was sitting there in the room because in Europe you didn't put the casket in a funeral home, it was in the room, so he was sitting and he went, and he was howling, it was a terrible howl, but there was no way that he would move from my mother's casket. He was sitting together with me and | spent the night with him there. When there was the funeral, he wanted to go in the funeral cortege and he became wild when they had to subdue him and put him in the room. He was very much attached to us. When my father came and all bloody, something happened to this dog and he, had like a paralysis and his head turned to the side. And my father took him out to a field and asked somebody to shoot him. And it was like an end of an era. Because this dog was like, everything what was good and carefree and pink and colorful in our childhood. So next day, we got up very, very early in the morning and this peasant took a wagon of hide, and put us there, camouflaged us and we had like babushkas(ph), and he took us, after a few hours, we came very early in the morning to Vilna. And he left us in a place that | was not even familiar where, how where. And | also didn't know that there was then a curfew of Jews, that the Jews could just walk a certain hours, and the Jews had to have yellow, a star, this, Stars of David, and they also had to walk in the gutter. So it took us a few hours and | was walking with my sister on the street like two little Polish girls. And when my aunt saw us, she thought that we came from the other side, who know what. Of course, she was very, very happy and we were in Vilna. A few days later, my father came. And my father, from all the aggravation of everything, became ill and had a very big abscess. And also, in Vilna, the Jews were persecuted like subhumans. Every day, new edicts were coming. We couldn't have a radio, we couldn't have a jewelry, we couldn't have a watch, we couldn't have properties, we couldn't talk to gentiles. | mean, we were plain ostracizes. And every day they used to come and take out men and young boys and they used to disappear and the women never knew where they were and what was done to these young . One of my uncles, my mother's sister's husband, was taken from the street, he was standing and reading an edict, he was taken from the street and she never saw him again. So the situation was very, very tense and my father was very ill and he was afraid to go out in the street. But once he became so ill and the abscess that he had was so big that during the night, he decided that he had to go, so my uncle and my aunt took him by the hand and they were walking in the middle of the night, they took him to a hospital that was in the Jewish section, it was a Jewish hospital. And he was staying there. And my other uncle no, never went out. And when the Gestapo used to come and ask if there are men there, she used to come out and, luckily, they would look in a few rooms and my, he was camouflaged, something, so my uncle was never found. So it was, until, until, | don't remember exactly the date, | think it was June 6, 19, no, no, no, September 6, 1941, that an edict came that all the Jews have to go to the ghetto. But it was such a diabolic, diabolic plan, a master plan, the way they did it. There was, as | told you, there was a section, a Jewish section in the heart of Vilna, a very, very cultural town that had a lot of theaters, archives and museums and it had, and Jewish, very rich Jewish life with libraries and all kinds of societies and charitable organization. And there were a lot of Jewish doctors that had a Jewish hospital. And also, there were a lot of facilities for poor Jewish children. In the heart of Vilna was a section where very poor Jews lived, it was in very bad conditions. The German came there in the middle of the night, with trucks, told all those Jews to walk out, put them on the trucks and took them to a prison called Lukishke(ph) and also took them to a place, a big forest called Ponare(ph), it was a place where those Jews was lined up and shot discriminately, first they had to make their own grave, and they were falling in those graves. When | was in ghetto, sick in the hospital, that | will tell you later, one of the woman who escaped between the dead bodies came to the ghetto and in the beginning when she was just a little lucid, she described what happened to her, so we knew for a fact that it was happening. And then, after a few days, she lost her mind. | still remember her yelling and screaming and crying after the children that she lost there, after the family. So it was, a very diabolic plan how to do it. When we were told to go to the ghetto, they came, everything was done early in the morning, and my uncle, Yosef(ph) Perski(ph), said to my aunt, \"Look, | am not going to the ghetto\". He was, had a very big advantage, he doesn't look Jewish, he look like a gentile, he look like a Pole and he was a business man that had a lot of connections with Polish peasants. He was buying wood there from them and also dried mushrooms, he says, \"| am going there and | want you to go with me\". She says, she, my aunt Sonja, who was like a second mother to us, said to him, \"I promised my sister on her death bed that | am, be a second mother and | will take care of those two little girls, Lilla({ph) and Rhya(ph),\" this was how we were called, \"And | won't leave them alone\". We didn't know about it. So they kissed and he sneaked out and he went. We never heard from him. And she went with us to the ghetto. Before he left, he gave us a few things to put on and as we were walking on the street, | had one coat and one raincoat and the Poles were lined up on the street and looking at, and | will never forget that they said, \"Look at those Jews, they have two coats\". So they were, nobody of them lifted a finger and said, \"Come, | give you food, | won't let you go to the ghetto\", because they really were rejoicing what was happening to us. There were two ghettos and one ghetto, the people that were taken to one ghetto, this was the ghetto that | was, were destined to leave. The other ghetto, a lot of people were taken, again, to the Lukishke prison, from there to Ponare, and they were simply shot. So this way the have the liquidated a lot of Jews. Before the war, before 1939, there were 80,000 Jews in Vilna. Vilna was a culture center, with many institutions, it was a culture Jewish center that was like a magnet from all the people that wanted to soak up and had a nice cultural experience. So slowly, slowly the Jewish population were reduced and also, at this time, there were all other people, Jews, that escape from Austria, that escape from Germany, that escape from Poland, that look for solace in Vilna, and they, unfortunate, were also put to live in the ghetto. | can talk for hours and hours about those conditions that were in the ghetto. It is indescribable. One room was habitated four or five family. There was no sanitary conditions, there was not even enough water. The rations were terrible, | mean, it's not to live and not to die. And the most important thing is, that the . All those people that were doers, that were thinkers, that were writers, became so helpless, so degradated, so broken up, that they just couldn't exist. | remember that my father, whenever that there was something in the family, they used to come, they with Mazur, he knew everything, he was, he felt that he can help, he felt that he can, so was the most helpless person in the ghetto. He was like a hunted animal and | think this was the biggest injustice that was done to Jewish people. By dehumanize them. The taking away their self-esteem, the taking away their pride, the taking away their human dignity. | know that you want to ask me how | meet my father. Yeah? Okay, you can ask me."

So come out and come in, we were, there was a lot of, you had to have papers.

This was the hope, the biggest, | was hungry, | was dirty, | was really in rags. | was cold, but what's hurting me, | was humiliated. And | couldn't understand that nobody in the world will speak up for us and ask, \"Why? What are those people, how those people mistreated? Why did they do, why, how are they singled out, to be put to such a torture and misery?\" And this was the biggest, the biggest thing that | couldn't understand."

            "question": "So how did you meet up with your father?",
            "answer": "You see, | was there with, in this room and once my aunt, who was a nurse, was walking on the street and she met somebody that she knew and she said to her, \"Where are you going?\" And she says, \"| am going to the hospital, | hope that my brother-in-law is there\". She says to me, \"Oh, your brother-in-law is in the hospital and he is crying, he is crying, where are his daughters, where are his, where is his family? He is beside himself, he doesn't want to get better\". And she took her by the hand and showed him where he was. So he stayed a very short time in the hospital, they didn't pamper people, they didn't have time for this. Later on he came and he stayed with us. In a very short time after, we were starving and also, my father was a smoker, he smoked, so this, the cigarette that he smoked, they were not real cigarette, but a homemade cigarette, many times | used to wake up and | used to see him smoking at night. And once he went out and he found a job, they were looking for people to work in, not as a pharmacist, but to work in a Spanish hospital that were outside the ghetto. And he was going every day and he was working there just as a laborer. And then one day, he met somebody and they and they told him they are looking for a pharmacist to look in, to work in a pharmacy because it was the Jewish hospital that was in the center of the ghetto and they needed a pharmacist. So he was very happy and very elated and, of course, they took him right in and he was working in the pharmacy. We were starving so much that at night sometimes we couldn't sleep. And they give us such a small ration that they gave us this piece of bread when we came home, me and my sister, we finished already the bread, so you know. As much as my aunt wanted to share the rations with us and may times she shared with us, it was not enough. So one day | decided, | heard that people are going outside the ghetto and they are working. So one time | got up very early in the morning and we had, in the middle of the ghetto, a place called Judenrat(ph) and there were people that, from the Jewish, that community, that were like in charge of the ghetto, they were, and one of those that was in charge of the ghetto was Jacob Gentz(ph), who was an officer in the Lithuanian army and he was like a Jewish commander of the ghetto. And right there there was a very big place and German used to come and take men and women, we were always segregated, to work and | was lucky enough that | was recruited by this German, his name was Kraus(ph). And he took, he took me to work. There was, maybe a handed, two handed young girls, and he, he took us out from the ghetto and we were working on the cobblestones and we were working, working, working a long time. And all of a sudden, the whole column stopped and to my amazement, they stopped in front of the private school where | spend the happiest days of my life. They took us down there, the school was occupied by Gestapo and from the classrooms they made offices. And there was a very big cellar there that when | was a student, | didn't even know that that existed. And they put us into this big cellar and the cellar was full with potatoes and we had to sort out the potatoes, they were rotten and so there | was, sitting in this , in this big cellar and | was thinking, this must be a nightmare. | wanted to run, run out from there, run to one of my classrooms, sit down in my seat, there was sitting late, and | said to myself, | am running out, | will take the hardest test, | don't care. And then all of a sudden | see a man walking there and taking care of chicken, there were a few chicken there in the cellar. He looked terrible, , this was Professor Morgenstern(ph), he was the latest of my teachers and he was like the teacher that took care of our class. And when my mother passed away and in our religion, for seven days, we sit shiva, he came to my house and he was talking to me, because when my mother was sick, my grades fell very badly because | didn't want to study and | was there always the teacher's pet. | was very good student. And he was talking to me and he said, \"Look, I'm sure that you, if you will just put your head to it, you can have a makeover test and you will have better grades\". But | remember saying to him, \"I really, at this point, | really don't care. For me, the world is finished\". So to my amazement, Professor Morgenstern is standing there and taking care of the chicken. You see, we are not supposed to socialize with men, this was the biggest crime, but | ran over to him, | said, \"Professor Morgenstern\". But he didn't recognize me. He went through a very big tragedy. In his presence, his wife and his daughter and his son were shot. And he was in such a state of shock, that he was just like an out mad(ph). As | was sitting there crying, afraid to cry loud because there were, full of sad, | see the door opens and two girls and a man are coming out, this was the janitor and his two Polish daughter. When | was a little girl and we were going to school, the janitor and his two daughters were always helping us with galoshes because the climate in our town was very severe in wintertime and many times we would share our lunches, we considered them our friend. When they saw me sitting there, they said, \"Look at this little Lilka(ph), we thought that all Jews were killed in Ponar\". This was the hello that | had from them. They were standing with their hands on their hips and they were practically laughing. Okay, the day ended and | came home and | was beside myself. It was just a little bit too much for me to go to the school, to see my professor and to hear those talking. Anyhow, look, | was going there and working there for a long, long time. And one advantage was that we could bring a few raw potatoes, but by the entrance, if they would caught us with potatoes, we would be shot on site. But we learned how to camouflage it, you know, and sometimes we were lucky, they would let us through, and those potatoes were very helpful because my father used to sell them and we could buy something else. After a while this job finished and this same German took us to an airport called Porbanek(ph) and, again, | started to work in Probanek. We were working long, long, long time. They brought us over, they used to always line us up and count us and the job with it was unload big pieces of coal, unload wood, unload potatoes and many times in the winter, we had to clean the airport. The snow was falling and there we were. And we saw those military little planes coming down and all those military men in their white warm coats and there we were freezing practically, we had no, no warm clothes and | had a very big problem because the shoes that | had were falling apart. So my father went to the Judenrat and they gave me a pair of shoes, they were wooden clumps(ph). They were wooden, you know, and with presented some material, when | was working in the snow | couldn't walk because the snow was, it was just sticking, so it was a very big deal. But one day, when we were lined up, | was lucky. Every day four women were chosen to go into the barracks and clean. This was a very big thing because you, it was wintertime, you didn't have to freeze. And | was lucky, | was chosen with all those four women. So there | was, standing in this big place, and | was given a bucket of water and a mop and | have to mop those barracks. Here you have me, | was just a school girl, who never in her life boiled a pot of tea. | didn't know it. So there were, the other three women who were more experienced , took their bucket and they knew what to do. They took me and put it in this big room that you couldn't see from one end to another and the floor was dirty and there | was standing, | didn't Know how to start. | know how to do it today, but | didn't know then and | was standing there and crying, bitter tears. All of a sudden, like an apparition, a very high German officer is coming with a few younger around him and he sees me and he says to me, \"What are you doing here?\" And at this time, | spoke a very good German yet, today | cannot speak German, | have a mental block. In a very clear German, | said to him, \"| am Jewish, brought in from ghetto to wash it and | don't Know how to do it\". End of Tape 1. Tape 2 He looked at me. | don\u2019t know what...he called in a soldier, told a soldier to wash the floor, took me by the hand and took me to his office, said to me \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d | was afraid to say, so | put my head down and he told another German to bring me a sandwich and hot soup, and then | was sitting there. He said to me, \u201cYou are Jewish?\u201d | said, \u201cYes,\u201d and he started to ask me my whole story and then | was sitting and conversing with this man and | became so...the hot soup...and the sandwich make me so, you know, courageous, that | didn't, | said to him, you want me, | Know, you want me to recite for you the Early King by Getta(ph); so, he says to me, \u201cYou know the Early King?\u201d | said, \u201cYes\u201d and then | was, | said | will stand down and | will recite it for you, there I\u2019m scared to death, reciting the Early King for him. And, this man says to me, \u201cYou are Jewish?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d | said, \u201cYes.\u201d He said, \u201cThey told us that all the Jews are crooked, have crooked noses, they have beards, they are liars, they are cheaters. | says to him, \u201cYou know | was very good in Chemistry.\u201d He wanted to ask me a few chemical formulas. Anyhow, to make the long story short, this man brought me a book of poetry and told another soldier to close the door, and brought me a few sandwiches that | took to my father and to my aunt and to my sister in the ghetto, and he was beside himself, he was so brainwashed that he was beside himself that the Jewish young girl can talk to him intelligently, can explain to him, can cite poetry, can read, and he gave me the book, but | was afraid to take it. | said to him, if they caught me, by the guard, with the German book, | was , | am telling you, to illustrate to you, how the German people were brainwashed, because if he was a high officer, he had a education. How could he let, to come to this level that he could think by himself, and he couldn't distinguish...and, in my experiences, during the Nazi era, | had a few encounters. Once | met with somebody that will talk and that he is the director of the Munich Opera. That he was also an officer. He was in the Assess(ph), and that he couldn't understand when | told him that as a child, | knew the Lehar(ph) operettas, | knew the opera; he couldn't understand that the Jews were all so cultured, people that are professionals, that they were not cheaters, and not liars, and not bloodsucker. It was beside him, and he couldn't understand this."

            "answer": "Well, as | told you before, the conditions in ghetto were very, very bad, and because | worked outside, | could help a little bit and we could surv...we were not starving, and also because my aunt was a nurse, she found herself also a job. She was selling vitamins, some kind of concoction. So we were starving and surviving but one summer, this was the summer of 1943, | was walking barefoot in because those shoes were so uncomfortable that | just, whenever | had the chance, | was take them off and | step on a rustic nail, and | was afraid to tell the German that was supervising him because only a Jew, or a Jewess or a Jewess girl could use, be use for them; what good otherwise we were shot from that...so when | came home, the infection started and from my big toe of my right leg to hip | had the red thing and my father knew a doctor, a surgeon in the hospital, so he went there and 10 oclock at night | had an operation and | was put in the hospital and | didn\u2019t work anymore but | was in the hospital. But, | have to describe you a little bit, the life in the ghetto. Despite all the conditions, the terrible condition, there was a cultural life brewing there. There were people that open a classic that were handsome, there were young songwriters, there were getting kind of performances, there were all a resistant movement. People were escaping through the source and going to the pat in the nearby woods. There was a very big forest called Rudnetska(ph) forest and there was also a pap In the , It was not dirty, it was...stained water...how you call it?"

            "answer": "Yes, Nadach(ph) Lake. And, around of . And | know that a lot of my friends escaped through the sewers, threw to pap and were fighting there. Unfortunately, | didn\u2019t have the money because when we came to the ghetto, we were ruined because everything was from and in order to be you had to have a gun and a gun at this time was like 2000 , a lot of money, so | was approached if | would like to join the partisan(ph). First of all, | couldn't leave my sister, was younger one and she was not available to go, and | wouldn't leave my family so | didn\u2019t go; but, there was a lot of resistant activity going on and | don\u2019t want you to think that the young people from Vienna were going like sheep to the slaughter, no, a few days before the liquidation of the ghetto, the ghetto resistance was throwing papers and saying the Jews, you are going to the slaughter, you are going to die anyhow, if you have a stone, if you have anything, if you have a stick. | even have, | found, | had a paper, the days resistant was distributing and there was a lot of disturbances with the resistant fear of Vietenburg(ph) that came, that Gestapo came to the ghetto and said that if you don\u2019t give Vietenburg(ph) the whole ghetto will be destroyed and this Vietenburg(ph) who was dressed aS a woman gave himself up because he didnt want to have on his conscience that the whole ghetto was destroyed. When | was in the hospital, one day | heard a very big commotion in the back yard and | was in very poor shape but | broked through the window and | saw Gestapo truck standing in front of the pharmacy and | saw my father in his white coat and other people taken out from the pharmacy and put in this truck. | started to yell \u201cFather\u201d; my father saw me and he was taken away from pharmacy and was taken away to Estonia(ph) labor camp. It was very turbulent time because the Gestapo was coming to Genz(ph) everyday, and demanding more and more people; and they were coming in the middle of the night taking people from beds and putting them in a column in the front they would put a fiddler, the fiddler was playing music to sooth the people...brainwash the people...and take them out from the ghetto. And, we never saw them again. There were a lot of rumors in the ghetto that the liquidation of the ghetto is very soon. We knew that the surrounding little towns were being liquidated and we even knew about Panado(ph) Forest and about the crematory and Gues . SO, when | was in the hospital, | was in such a poor shape that my wound was full of puss and didn\u2019t heal; but one night, my aunt came and said that she heard rumors that all the people from the hospital will be taken because Genz(ph) decided he better get the sick people than the young people. So, she said this is not the place for you. So she took me out and we went to our room and in the middle of the night, a friend of my father came to us and said that heard the rumor that tomorrow would be liquidation from the ghetto...that he has a secret room, we used to call it Mileana(ph) this is in Polish, and we will wait in this room till the German leave us and then we will go maybe to the partisan(ph) and he had built this secret room and because he knew my father, he included me, my aunt and my little sister and we took there. And, the only thing that we had to eat was a head of green cabbage. As we were sitting there, we heard all kinds of commotion, and they always it was already early in the morning, and it was September 23, 1943. The big heavy commode, you know, was moved and Ukrainians and Lithuanians and Germans came running and the Ukrainians were yelling in Russian, \u201cGive me your watch, jussy(ph), jussy(ph). They wanted to rob us right away and they all took us to the center of the ghetto, they separated the men from the women. Of course, | meet there, my other aunt and with her daughter and her son was already taken and her son\u2019s wife; we all stuck together. And, they took us out through the gates of the ghetto, and we were walking, walking, and they took us to a very big place called the Rosa(ph) Cemetery(ph). When we came to the Cemetery, the first thing we saw was three young bodies hanging and dangling in the wind; there was a girl and two young boys...they were pak . They were caught, and this is how they brainwashed us and intimidated us and made us afraid to move, to escape, to plan something, a riot or whatever. On this Arosa(ph) Cemetery, it was such an erie feeling, like the death was watching over us. We were separated, men separate and women separate and we have...there is a selection. The one that goes to life go to the right and the one that go to the left are going to death. And, you know, the woman said that mothers with young children are going to the left, old people are going too, only able bodies are going to the right; and my sister at this time was pretty young and she looked much younger, so my aunt Sonya took off a pair of her shoes and they had the little heel and she put them on and she made her a bust and she told her to straighten out, and we were walking, my sister was in the center, my aunt on one side and | from the other side and as we came to the selection, the German pushed my aunt to the left and me and my sister to the right and | started to cry and | said \u201cI want to go with my mother,\u201d and he had a big rifle and a very big stick, so he beat me and he said to me, you are too young, you have to work for the phatalan(ph). And | said, \u201cBut, | want to go with my mother!\u201d He beat me again and | never saw my aunt again. She went to the left. As we were going to the selection, we saw little children that were abandoned by their parents, not men, but there was one little boy, | will never forget him...was maybe three years old, he was a beautiful boy and the assessment(ph) was holding him and he was crying \u201cMama, Mama!\u201d This is what they did, they took young mothers and they separated them from the children. What is...1 don\u2019t think that there is a bigger crime than separate a child from the mother and dehumanize the mother that she should abandon your child because she wanted to live. When we were standing there | was crying so hard that people came around me and my aunt came and she said \u201cWhere is my sister, where is Sonya?\u201d and we were beside ourselves. She was sent to the right and she looked older then, but it was her destiny...they put us...they took us to the railroad station. They put us in cattle trains. Those cattle trains were packed so much that we didn't have a place where to sit down. We were just standing up and in the middle of this cattle train was a very big tub with the disinfectant and this was our toilet. We were just standing up and sometimes people were without water for a couple of days, no water, no bread; people were just falling like flies. One day, in the middle of the night, after this long voyage, we would, sometimes we looked, you know, through a opening, and we were just so countryside. We drove to a place, the music was playing, the dogs were barking, there were Gestapo there, you know the Gestapo with their hats, you know with there emblems and with their rifles and with those big dogs and they said, \u201cOut! Out! Out!\u201d And, music was playing and very big reflectors, there was light, twas...and they told again to line up and there was electric fences around us and they took us inside and again lined up. And this was the first time that | saw a defaced woman. This woman is something...| have to describe it for you...most of them would buxomy young women with blond hair with very tight uniforms, with very long boots and all of them had horse hooks(ph) and they used them, thy were very strong with very strong voices and if they saw a young Jewish girl that was blond, she was their victim because a Jewess girl was not suppose to look like an Aryan. Near me was standing a beautiful young woman, she was much older than me but she was a real beauty with blue eyes and blond hair and despite that she came from the ghetto, somehow she was outstanding. And they were beating her for no reason. You know when you stand there, you were not a person, you didn\u2019t have a name, you just had a number and then they told us to line up and to disrobe and naked we were taken to a very big place. The only thing remarkable about this very big place, it was that it had like showerheads on top and since we heard about gassing, me and my sister and my aunt, we were prepared that they took us to a gas chamber. So | was standing all naked by this little shower head and | was, we were saying goodby and | was begging God for one thing... should be the first one should fall because | couldn\u2019t see with my aunt and my sister, , SO | was there really praying the first time in my life with the way | could and | said, \u201cMomma, help me, | want to be the first one.\u201d For an eternity, they closed the door, for an eternity; we thought...some people became hysterical, mothers were kissing their daughter, they were saying goodby, people were fainting; then all of a sudden, water started to come out, it was not gas, they put us to wash up and clothes and it was like water of life! We were drinking, we were washing. They didn\u2019t give us soap, | don't think they had soap, but we're just washing and drinking this water and this was like a miracle. And again they told us to line up and again we were...they told us to dress and we were taken to German doctors and then they examining us and then telling us, asking us if we have some gold hidden. A lot of girls were victims, | was a victim, my sister, my cousin, they were so rough, looking for gold. Anyhow they finally took us to bound(ph) and they put on the bounds and | think they gave us something to eat, | don\u2019t remember exactly but we were so exhausted and so emotionally drained from this experience that we came alive from this gas chamber, we were just, feel asleep. | was, this was of our concentration camp. It was located near . | was there not, likely not a long time because it was a place where you didnt do, they starved you to death; there were some women assigned to check the clothes, to sort out the clothes, to...! forgot to tell you, they also, before they took us to the doctor, they shaved our head and they gave us some kind of clothes, not those worn uniform but same, some kind of clothes. And one day, every day, they woke us up and we had to say to our and also we had like a dog tags. We had a number, so we had to answer to the number. Four o'clock in the morning, three o'clock in the morning, they used to count us, they always use to count us and then we notice that a lot of people became so desperate that they throw themself on this electric wire and they was just burned there. They use to clean up the dead bodies. And one day, they came and they said they are looking for people and we had to go again for the selection, and again | told my sister to straight out herself and me and my sister, my aunt, and the two cousins were very lucky day, they took us to this labor camp called Denawerdkee(ph). Denawerdkee(ph) was a crazy government place run by the organization and they were building there and we worked also very hard there, but in comparison to or comparison to ghetto, we were in paradise because first of all, we had hot water to wash, the food was much better and we had better condition...better...even we worked very hard...early in the morning we had to line up and they were again counting us and also there we used to unload those big chunks of coal, we used to haul in the potatoes, and we used to work very hard but it was much better for us there."

There were no fight, on the contrary, there was a lot of solidarity, like my aunt became like the tent mother and she used to take care of us, you know, and sometime if she could, she would give a piece of bread to us because she said \u201cIl am old, | don\u2019t need so much food.\u201d So we used to stick a lot together, there was a lot of solidarity. | was later separated from my aunt and my two cousins and | was just with my sister, but | think a very important factor in this, our survival, was because | was with my sister; because when my father used to say as a little girl, \u201cYou have to take care of your sister.\u201d | took it very seriously and | was afraid to die that, wnat would happen to my sister.

And, the sec...then it goes, the day is over and the sun is long gone and the column is going slowly and they go with tired feet. They are very tired of the long and heavy day and they are moving very slowly, but Jews don't loose you faith because the time will soon come when we will be free, and we will work for ourselves in our own land, our country."

            "question": "",
            "answer": "After Dinawarke(ph), we were taken to Stothoff(ph) concentration camp. Also the conditions were very bad, we were separated and me and my sister we were sent to Stienhoff(ph) labor camp and it was already the time that the German army started to loose and after working in this labor camp, we were put into a death march; I\u2019m calling it a death march because for two months we were walking through the Polish country land, it was January and February in 1945, and it was a very big chaos, we use to see people, inmates from a concentration camp going in one direction and then we were going in a different direction. It was just a very, very hard time because people younger girls were falling in the snow and just never getting up. You had to be always in the front because if you were in the back you were shot; and after walking two months, on March 10, we were walking a whole day and a whole night and then in the morning on March 11, we were taken in a very big barn; and we were so exhausted, we were already contacted typhus, that we really didn't care. In this very big barn, we meet other people that were also coming from all over; and as | was sitting there, | was so exhausted that | really felt that my end is near and | just really didn\u2019t care and as | looked down through a little opening, | saw the assess(ph) people putting piles of wood around the barn and we were told, not we were told, but there was a rumor going that we will be burned alive because the guards didn\u2019t know what to do, the Russians were advancing and they didn\u2019t Know what to do with us inmate of concentration camp. We were sitting, and we were so exhausted that we really didn\u2019t care what they were doing, and then we had the very big commotion and we heard shot and we heard dog barking and horses and then a man started to scream, \u201cWe are free, we are free, the Russian are coming.\u201d | call this day March 11, 1945, my day of triumph because we triumphed in a very small way by simply surviving. We were so sick that after the big barn, the gates of the big barn, after they were open, people burst out and started to run, but we were so weak that we couldn't even run and on top of everything, there was wet snow around and | didn't have shoes. So as | was standing there and my sister put a piece of the cardboard under me, and we were six friends by this time, we didn\u2019t know what to do. Russian soldiers jumped from a tank, a Russian tank, run to a lying assess(ph) guard, took off his shoes, and the assess(ph) guard had very good shoes, put them on and gave me his shoes. So his boots were my savior because, if my, by this time my toes were already black and my legs were all covered up with open wounds because they were froze beaten. Luckily we found a woman that was a Hungarian doctor, and | don\u2019t where, but she found a Red Cross band and those six girl and her, we kind of stuck together and we went over, there was a factory, the place where we were liberated is called Krumall(ph), this is in east Russia; and it was a milk factory, and they took us in...we went to this milk factory, actually we crawled because we were so exhausted and what we saw there, | don\u2019t want to see it anymore in my life because hungry people were drinking the creme and the milk and vomiting and just lying down and being so sick that they couldn't even lift a finger, and there were a lot of dead people that were lying there. And we stayed there through the night and in the morning she somehow found a horse and buggy and she heard that there was a Russian field hospital, they will take the survivors in, SO we were decided to go there. On the way, we saw so many Russian soldiers and we were young girls so it was a very dangerous, dangerous way for us to travel. One of the Russian came and took away our horse and gave us another horse and then on the way to the hospital we went to a empty house and we slept there. In the middle of the night the Russian soldiers came and said that they are...they heard that they are very nice...was looking girls sleeping here and they wanted to come in there and we started to scream and yell and luckily this time, | Knew very well Russian; so | went to this doctor, in the middle of the night, to the commander of the Russians and | explained to him that we are all full of typhoid and we are going to the Russian hospital, so luckily he put a guard and no Russian soldiers came to disturb us because unfortunately a lot of survivors were rapped by those soldiers. This is one of the tragedies of the war. Finally, when we arrived to this hospital that was a field hospital and we were put in this room, and both me and my sister contracted typhoid; and | was the one that had it in the worst way and the whole time when | was having my nightmares, | was asking for the black grapes that | was reading about just before the German came. And people just were dying, young girls were just dying, lying like flies. One of the young girls that was lying near me, just before she died, she was from Leebough(ph) in the Rigor(ph) and she asked me if | would ever find, her name was Leah, if | ever find her brother and | should tell her that she said goodby to him. My sister recovered sooner and she kind of took over the roll now of the oldest sister and she took care of me and she asked to work in the hospital kitchen so she could stay with me. With me was a very, very slow recovery. | was physically very sick but | was also mentally devastated and after a long, long time they put on a train and they send us to Soapat(ph), it is a town near the Baltic Sea, and they opened the sanatorium there, a lot of people from Poland use to go there because they use to bathe the Baltic Sea. And when we came to this big house, there were many girls there, but | was the worse there, | was spend my days just lying there and looking to the ceiling. There was no way that | had...that | wanted to live. And the doctors told my sister that | am very, very depressed and | had another problem--that my toes were so black that they wanted to cut my toes off, then | would be like an invalid and my sister said that, \u201cMy sister is not herself, she doesn\u2019t give you permission to do it,\u201d and she begged them and luckily they didn\u2019t cut my toes off. One day my sister was called to the doctor that was in charge, they said that I\u2019m getting worse and worse, something drastic has to be done. So my sister dressed me and took me by force down to the dining area. As | was going the steps, the first thing that | saw was a piano, it was a very big grand piano and something just took me to the piano and | sat down and | started to play. | was playing by ear without notes and when | sat at the piano, it was like all the years moved away and | was again this little happy girl, school girl, and | started to play and the girls came over and we were singing; and something happened to me, | woke up. It was like a shock therapy and | started to get better and better and better and there were, over there, gardens with full with fruit at this time, because | remember it was summer and we use to go and eat this fresh fruit; and | started to compose myself. | still looked terrible, first of all, because of typhoid they cut our hair again, and | didn\u2019t gain too much weight but at least there was...everyday | use to come down and play the piano."

            "question": "You wanted to go back to Vienna?",
            "answer": "| wanted to go back to Vienna, because the last time when | saw my father, was in Kaiser (sp) concentration camp and he was came with the transport from Estonia(ph) and he was going around and asking for his little daughters; and | was at time in Dinawarkee(ph), so when somebody came, there is a Mr. Margules who is looking for his little daughters, so when | heard about it, they use to send us to Kaiser___(ph) to have our teeths pulled, so | thought that, said that, | have a tooth ache. And | went there and | saw my father, in the barracks, there(ph). Whenever | remember my father, | was always seeing him a vigorous young handsome man, so when | saw my father, there was somebody standing there but it was not my father and | recognize him by his voice and by his eyes. So | risk my life and | went to the men\u2019s barrack. But because at this time, | was dressed like a man with a jacket and pants, so they didn't recognize me, and since | didn't have hair anyway, | looked like a little boy, young boy, anyhow; and | found him there. Of course, he embraced me and asked me where is my little sister? And this was the time that my little sister had rheumatic fever, was in Dinawarkee(ph) in the crankeovere(ph) and you couldn't be sick, but there are certain things in life that are just in explainable. The doctor, the assess(ph) doctor that was taking of the people in the crankeovere(ph) had a daughter that was the same age as my sister and as | told you, my sister was a very pretty little girl, and he felt sorry for her because she looked like his daughter a lot, so he used to take out medicine from the assessment and give it to her and he didn\u2019t tell nobody that he was keeping, he kept her for a couple months; otherwise she would be sent back to the concentration camp and she would never come back. So when my father asked me, how is my sister, | told him, \u201cShe is alright.\u201d So he says to me, come tomorrow and | want to see her; and he said to me, like this, when we will survive, we have to come to Sole(ph) to the pharmacy. | don\u2019t you anything, just two things, first, take care of your sister and second, remember who you are and bring me a good name back. So this stayed with me for the whole, whole time. Next there when | went, he wasn't there already; and my sister of course was very sick so she couldn't...but he never knew it; and this was the last time that | saw my father. But WHEN | was sent from Soapert(ph) to Vienna, | was very anxious to go and see because when, after the liberation, when we got to little Beartta(ph) we were looking for the family. We were two little young girls, all alone, with shaved hair, very slim, with no money and no family. So the first thing we were looking for our father. We never heard about him. We wrote letters, we were, there were all kinds of organizations, we never heard about him; BUT, on our way to Vienna, we were traveling by trains and it was a very dangerous situation because there was, there was actually no laws, and two girls were very, very easy prey to anybody, but we had, how you say this rupsack(ph), yeh?, on our bed, and you what we're having, black bread, dry bread, because we said when we have bread, we don\u2019t need anything else. So people had stockings, people had dresses, we had two those things on our bed with bread; and then when we stopped on the station we use to take a little water and this was what we ate. And when we came to Lougue(ph), we met a lot of Jewish people and we started to talk and over there, also, we met a girl from Vienna--she was older than us--and we became like a trio. And she was a very smart girl, very educated, she was a university student studying medicine and she was one of the students that didn't want to stand...sit, on the left it was standing up. Much more experience that me and my sister. So she was talking to people and she was told that there is a border under we were book(ph) and if it pass the border it will be Russia...If we come to Russia, we will never come back. And as we were standing there and talking to people a girl, that was together with us at concentration camp, pass by and she recognize us; and she says to me \u201cWhat are you doing there?\u201d So we said to her, \u201cWe are going back to Vienna.\u201d She said, \u201cDon\u2019t go back.\u201d But you see, she says, \u201cYou cousin\u2019s wife is her in Lougue(ph); she is in her brother's house. Why don\u2019t you go there and sleep over?\u201d So we all, so she took my older friend because she had also a house, and me and my sister, w went to my cousin- in-law, you know (chuckle), and she of course, she never expected that we will live and she never expected to see us and spent a lot of time together because was at concentration camp and in Dinawarkee(ph); so she treated us very nice, she gave us a bed, she gave us food, we sleep; and in the morning she had a conference with her brother...What to do with us? So they decided that in Lougue(ph) on Sahoniya(ph) 20, there was kibbutz(ph) and they were collecting all this orphans and they was planning to educate them and send them to Israel. So the next day we went there to the 20. When we came there...you want to ask me something?"

They were an organization that was a centrist(ph) Zionist organization; and their job was collect the orphans that survived, educate them and smuggle them, literally, to Israel because there was no way that the Jews were permitted, (chuckle) those who survived, were permitted to go their own land Israel. When we came there, the next morning, and they took us there, so of course...it was a very big problem with me because | was looking like the walking dead. | was very skinny, very sick and when they saw me there, the man that interviewed me was afraid that | will die any moment and they didn\u2019t want to have this traumatize all the young people there.

And then one day, there were orders that we are on our way to Israel. It was, it was, it had to be illegal. Because we didn't have papers. So it was organized that we had to wander from one country to another. So from Lodz, we went to Czechoslovakia, from Poland into Czechoslovakia. In Czechoslovakia we were just a very short time and then they took us with trucks, always with trucks, and always there were young Jewish boys that came from Israel that were helping us organize it. And then we came, we came to the DP camps of Germany, where they put us in Munich, we stayed there a few days ina very big place and then they send us to a very big farm that was taken away from a Nazi. And they organized an agricultural school there because they wanted us to know how to work the land. So we were there in this very big farmhouse. There was separate dormitories for the girls, a separate dormitory for the boys. We were just supervised by one person and there was never any pregnancy, never anything fooling around. Never, on the, never anything, you know, on the contrary, there were one, one weekend there were six marriages. Everybody was lonely. And we taught how to milk the cows, how to fish, how to work in the garden, how to work in the fields. And they had a very big pond full of fish, so when we had this wedding for the six couples, we took the fish out and it was, it was a very relaxing atmosphere. And all of us that were looking like , very big compose and they became different people, but let me just tell you one thing. The people around us are very much against us and every night there were a boy and girl walking around and guarding. And we also had guard dogs because they couldn't stand it that there was youngsters that survived and they were, that are looking every day better. And so we were, our lives were always in danger."

We had supervision by the doctors and also, we had rations, you know, you know. And tt, we were, we felt very disappointed because we didn't want it to be charity. We didn't want charity cases, we didn't want to be supported by somebody, we want to be self, self-substaining, we wanted to go to school, we wanted to learn some, a profession or something, hand, you know, things like this. So we were very, but we were told that this is just a transition, that we are on our way to Israel, that we were going to Italy and when we, when we come to Italy, we will board a boat and it will take us to our promised land. You know, many times we were taken to movies, they were trying to make our life as pleasant as possible, but it, we lost a lot of self- esteem and also, the stigma to being a displaced person to any thinking young person was very degredating, you know. And we didn't have too much books to read, the library, they, as much as they stocked it to educate us and the kibbutz were having all kinds of workshops and things like this, but still we were hungry for knowledge. So finally, here we are on Christmas night crossing the Alps. | mean, it was a very hard experience and we were crossing as Greeks. And imagine what a coincidence, in the same night my husband, my future husband whom | didn't know, was also crossing the Alps and going to Italy and wanted to emigrate to Israel, | didn't know him, he didn't know me. But before he left, he was in Munich and before he left Munich, his sister-in-law baked him a batch of cookies.

When | met him, he told me that the night, and | said to him, \"Oh, | ate your cookie\". So finally, it was a very arduous journey and, because of the boys that were in kibbutz, were helping the girls, we made it.

Anyhow, finally, they brought us to Italy and they brought us to a displaced camp near Milano called Adriatica(ph). We stayed there for awhile and then we were transferred to another camp, displaced camp, near Torrino(ph), Turin(ph), called . And we are settled down there, we lived in barracks and were taking all kinds of courses, you know. But we were still in kibbutz. And then one day they took us to the movies and | was sitting there in the movies and, as | told you, the girls from my kibbutz didn't know Russian because they were from Poland, only me and my sister. So they were showing a Russian movie without subtitles, so | was sitting there and explaining them in Polish what was going on and behind me was sitting a young boy with his friend and this was my husband, my future husband. My, Edward Margules. And he was fascinated, \"Who was the girl who was talking Russian?\" Because he knew very good Russian and he wanted to meet, so when the lights went up, he saw me and in this times | had two long, very long hair and | still, | think | was wearing braids at this time, looking very young. So he found out where | am and he asked some guys from, to introduce me. And he started to court me. He was in a different kibbutz and | was in a different kibbutz. And when he was courting me, he started to talk to me and he found out that | like opera, that | like ballet, that | like theater, so he would take me to the city of Milan and he would get to La Scala ; and this was the first time that | saw La Scala. Twice he took me, once we saw Sampson and Delilah. And then, | saw another opera, | cannot think, I'm a little nervous, | cannot think about it now. And once on our trip, | told him that I'm looking for my father, so he said he heard that in Milano, there is a Jewish center that people, displaced people, are putting on the wall that are looking for this, are looking for this, so we went there before the performance, we came a little earlier and | put two notices. One, that me and my sister are looking for my father and then | had like a, | think | remember, | had a visual memory, | remembered that letters used to come from Argentina and they were always addressed to my father and the return address was like an |. Mazur, this | saw. So | said, you know, | know that | have an uncle in Argentina, so let me put a notice up that | am looking for my uncle. And | didn't remember his first name, | just put |. Mazur. As it happens, my young, my uncle was a younger brother of my father, was living Buenos Aires and he was also looking for survivors of his family.

It was late 50's, beginning of 60's, and this would be a good field. So | had a friend of mine who had a garage and he was a very good mechanic, had his own business and he was near Hospital on Jerome(ph) Avenue. And he had a lot of doctors that were coming from the x-ray department, fixing cars because a lot of them, he was a very good mechanic for foreign cars and they had foreign cars. So they asked this, he asked them, how can | approach this that | wanted to work in x-ray? So they sent him, told him | should come to the chief of the department. So | got dressed and | went to the chief of the department and | spoke to him and | said | will be very much interested in, to go to school and be x- ray technician. He said, \"This is a very good field because we need a lot of x-ray technician\". And he send me to somebody who was in charge in Mount Sinai(ph) Hospital, of the x-ray school. And | went to her and she was very sympathetic to me and | told her that | don't have a high school diploma, and she said to me that if | promise her that after six months, | give her a high school equivalency, | can attend the school. So there | was, going to Mount Sinai. | was living there near Hospital, and every day when my children came from school, 3:00, | had to leave them until 5:30, 6:00 until my husband came. And from 4:00 until 10:00 | had school in Mount Sinai. Then | used to come back and then | also had to learn the equivalency, so it was quite hectic. Okay, | made the equivalency and then | finished x-ray technician and my husband was very unhappy that | am going and I'm looking for a profession because the European men are very proud people and it was, it was very upsetting to him, he cannot support his family in a certain style. But, | saw the man was working two jobs and when | was going, walking on the street with my two little boys, a slice of pizza was twenty-five cents with a coke and | had to think twice if I, if | couldn't buy a slice of pizza.

We used to entertain each other, you know, | had a very good social life. We cling to each other because we had no families, so like, friends were families. Very few of them had families. And so we cling to each other. Whenever we came together, we used to talk about all kinds of things, we used to talk politics and what movie did you saw, but we always ended with our, what we went through. This one was talking about it, and this was the end. And so, so it was in us. And another thing, | used to have a lot of nightmares. | used to wake up and screaming, yelling, and | was, always my husband used to wake me up. So in my heart, | was always living with it. It was never abandoned me. And |, and everything was written in blood and tears inside of me. But | never wanted to talk about it and to burden my children about it. So between ourselves, the survivors, we used to share our experiences and this was always the end of our conversation. But we never spoke to anybody else because a lot of my friends had a number and they felt very bad when some of them, they used to go on the bus and people used to talk about the number. | didn't have a number because in this concentration camp where | was, they didn't put a number, | just had a number, and | am so sorry that the first thing after | was liberated in Fluma(ph), | threw this number away into the snow. | should have kept it as a memento, all right, some things. But we never, you see, we were always considered second class citizen. We all spoke with an accent and we all, and we always, a lot of people were very jealous of us, because nobody from our people went . Nobody asked from help and a mother used to say to a child, \"A stomach that is not made from glass. If you go to somebody's house, and even if you are hungry, you refuse because you fill your stomach the way | fill your stomach\". And we never, we were very proud people. When we, we worked very hard, we were very ambitious that our children should have a very good education, we wanted the best for them, and we never wanted any charity. Very few, maybe in the beginning when the first came, they took something from the Jewish organization, some help. But right away, they wanted to stand our own feet. Without the language, some of them with not even a good education, they were very ambitious and they very, they wanted very much to build a future and a lot of them are very successful. And also, | had this, always the idea, that charity begins at home. So | always remembered that my mother used to say, \"If you meet somebody on the street and he or she puts a hand in front of you, you have to share it, you have to put something in\". And this was staying with all my life and this is how | brought my children up."

My youngest son found out about it the day that he decided, he already finished college, and he decided to go, he found himself a job in Los Angeles and he decided to go to Los Angeles. And he, it was the last night when he was living here, and he was all packed and the next day we had to take him to the airport. And he said to me, \"Ma\", it was already, my husband was already sleeping, and he said to me, \"Ma, | have to ask you something. | know that you are a survivor, but you never talk about it. Why don't you want to tell me, | am a big boy\". And | said, \"Michael, why | never wanted to tell, | didn't want to burden you\". He said to me, \"Ma, | am a big boy, you have to tell me. | want to share it with you, especially now that | am leaving the house\". And | was very nervous because when he went to college | Knew, you know, that it was different, he went to Boston College for four years, but he was coming, here he was going to the other side of, to the Pacific Ocean, to the other side of the United States, and he's going all alone, my baby is leaving me. | was very upset. So we were sitting right here by this table and | started to tell him. And he was sitting and we were talking until 3:00 in the morning. And when we finished talking, | told him, he kissed me and he hugged me and he said, \"| am very grateful that you shared it with me\". And this is how he found out.

            "answer": "You see, when we were young, the survivors, we were so busy bringing up the children, making up a living, acquiring some kind of education that it stayed with us. But then, | joined an organization, American Survivor, American Holocaust Survivors. And what was bothering me the most, that before the holidays, the high holidays, the Jewish people go to the cemetery and | couldn't go. | belonged to a Jewish Center and I, the first thing when | started to make money, | went there and the memorial tablets, | went to make two tablets, for my mother and my father. And it had to cost a certain cent of money and | paid them out. And every year, when there is, how they say, the day they, the memorial services, the day that they passed away, that is a prayer for the dead that is said, so every year, you put candles on and | used, so | Knew what the date for my mother, but for my father | didn't know, so | had a date, | took and arbitrary date for the liquidation of the Vilna(ph) ghetto, so I, it is just around the high holidays, so this is when |, when | mourn my father. So | put, | put the lights on and then | tell my son to say a prayer, you know. And this is, because | want my children to know that they have grandparents. And also, the memorial, memorial candles are lit in the Jewish Center. So, it's, this is how | observe. But, when, when | joined this organization, they have once a year, a very big commemorative services. And this is done ina very good taste. And so! come, | go there and | go there like to the cemetery. And this is the time that | remember, recite in mind, all my family that perished and all, my parents and, you know, my cousins and all of them. Because from my mother's side, there were six children, nobody survived. There were also, children's children, grandchildren, nobody survived. So my mother's, the Lipkovich(ph) family, there is nobody survived. So they are part of the six . SO this is when | come and say, and pay honor to their memory. And every year I'm going there and this is kind of like, that like | go to the cemetery. But, you see, when those people formed their society, American Holocaust Survivors, and Volsa(ph) Ghetto Holocaust Survivors, they kind of open the door for the survivors to talk. And this is when the survivors became a little older. And had a little time to share their experiences, to talk about it. To feel an obligation that they, that to tell the world what happened to them, to make sure it shouldn't happen again. And because they became more mature and became better educated and had a little more time to give, were not so busy with making a living and with little children and the diapers and the problems. So they start, they formed a society and they woke up and they had all kinds of obligations that they felt that they have to fulfill. Especially when it became known that there are people that negate that the Holocaust every existed. And that they want to rewrite history. So we felt that this is our time for us to speak up. That we are really, by silence, committing a very big injustice to those who cannot speak."

She says, \"We are amazing people because we are trying to give our children what we missed. And we are overprotective, we overindulged them, but we are giving them the best that we can\".
