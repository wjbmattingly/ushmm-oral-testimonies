            "answer": "Yes, Just prior to the liberation I was in so-called [indecipherable] which means in English, a sick bay. I was lying there with some broken ribs, which I received on the last beating that I got at the hands of the meister, the supervisor from the airplane factory in which I w -- slaved. And at that time the allied forces were closing on the - USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 3- around our city, Bittenberg. We were not really sure who were they, but we were -- we were subjected to bombardments and the Germans closed us in the barrack, and the -- the doors were locked and the windows were covered, and we were not let out to work, and as well with the sick bay. Since this came so rapidly, they did not have time to dispose of us, because the plan was to somehow eradicated the camp with the inmates. I was brought from the sick bay to the main barrack when they closed it. And the following day, or two days later, one of the girls looked throug h the window, the -- the shutter, and she have seen that the towers where the German soldiers were usually with -- watching us, ar -- they we re absent, nobody was there. So they decided to break the door ope n and run. And the ones who c ould, ran to the kitchen. They brought us some very silly foods, margarine, one egg, I think, a couple of potatoes and we stayed for awhile there. We had very mixed emotions because we didn\u2122t know what to do. However, we decided that the safest thing for us would be to leave the camp, since it was abandoned by the Germans. This was the supposedly moment of the liberation, and we didn\u2122t feel liberated yet. It was very strange feeling. We went across the street, my friends helped me."

And they -- as a matter of fact they say, Blanka, another day, another day and we will be free. And we crossed the street. There was the house in which the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 4commandant lived from the camp, with a gard en, lovely flowers which I envied when I passed by and saw it. We went inside, it was abandoned as well. And there were, I think, seven of us, and one girl has -- had a mother with her yet. And they brought the food, and somebody was preparing the fo od, and all of a sudden the commandant came back with a gun, cocked the gun, aimed at the group of us and of course we were petrified, we thought that\u2122s the end. And this big, strong man with the gun was afraid of us. And he backed out and disa ppeared. At that moment we thought the safest thing would be to leave his house and go towards the fire, because this indicated that whoever is fighting, is a liberator."

We passed a field, it was street or a field, there were two young men there, and they joined us. These were two Polish men who worked there during the war as hands at the farms because Germany needed laborers, and they joined us. Since we were from Poland, we spoke Polish, so the seven of us reached the front line. Unbelievable, unbelievable sight. The first soldiers that we -- soldier that we saw was of Asiatic origin, I believe, some Mongol maybe, with the eyes that make seem that he\u2122s Asiatic. And he was with the dirty uniform, filthy. And we kissed his boots. I remember that moment. And he motioned with his hands for us to go in the back. We went in the back, they told us that we can help ourselves to food, which was in a ba rrel, there were herrings. We ate some of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 5the herrings, we got very sick from it because the bodies were empty -- the stomachs, rather, were empty. And there was no water because the pipes weren\u2122t working. So -- but we were pretty sick, in pretty bad shape."

So we reached a house -- this was a village, finally, and we reached the very first house, which had a slightly damaged roof, I believe, and we went in. And it -- since the fighting go -- was going on, we decided to go to the basement. Th ey had the basement, which was very, very well appointed. They had two sort of cots to sleep, with -- with linen on them, and they were -- the walls were lined with shelves, and the shelves had all sorts of jars with conserves and meat and -- and fruit. And in the other part of the basement there were barrels. They were potatoes, carrots, and water. So, ever -- and -- and there were some candles. So they were really very well prepared. And of course we ate some of the stuff, and we lied down. And that basement was approachable by a swing door up and down, that\u2122s all I remember, up and do wn. And at some point during the night, the door swang open and two Russians came, and they demanded girls. I believe that at least one of them was drunk, because he pulled up his gun and started to shoot at the jars. Now, I said to myself, when I survived the five years, or over five years of war, and I\u2122m still alive, I\u2122m not going to be subjected to that, I\u2122d rather die. So I ask one of the Polish boys to sa ve me, and I said to him, look, tell them that I\u2122m -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 6pretend I\u2122m your wife. I was lying on this cot, and he covered me, and he sat down on top of me. And the other girl did the sa me, and one went in the back room where the barrels were, and two girls were raped. Now the -- the Russian who was shooting at the jars, was laughing like a child. To him this was absolutely normal. Women and men were made to -- to mate. So there was nothing strange to him. He couldn\u2122t understand that -- that we hated it, that we couldn't understand it. I remember that the pieces of the broken jars, the glass, embedded in my left leg, and I still have the scars. And I didn\u2122t make a peep, not a sou nd, because I wanted to survive, so I was quiet. One of the girls became hysterical; her name was Blanka, I remember her, she was the youngest. She became hysterical a nd she started to scr eam, so the Russian took a candle, put the light on -- lit the candle and brought her some water. And he put the compress, cold compress on her forehead, he said, okay. When the morning finally arrived --"

She came from a very religious family, Jewish religious family, so in the morning she did not tell us that she was raped, but we knew she was raped, because USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 7you -- you could hear the sounds. Extraord inary. The next morning we decided to leave this place for something safer, and we walked through the village, found another house. They were -- all the houses were abandoned by the Germans who were running towards the American line, or English line. They did not want to be captured by the Russians. And the cows and the pigs we re not fed so they were making sounds. We got into a house, we ma de ourselves comfortable, we ate. The two boys went to the garden and they chas ed some chickens, we cooked the chickens. After we finished eating we took the tablecloth with the china and threw it out of the window. That was -- this was the little revenge. We didn\u2122t want to wash the dishes, we didn\u2122t know what will happen. It didn\u2122t feel like we are liberated. There was not the sense of freedom yet. Oh, first of all, the war was still going on. We were so-called liberated by the Russians, who became in our eyes, another oppressors. So I questioned myself, is -- was th is worth it, all my suffering, to arrive at this moment? What\u2122s going to be? What will happen later on? And there was a story about -- I believe that I had on media tape, that we we re so scared of the Russians that at night we took a ladder and we went to the attic, and we slept in the attic, four of us. The two boys slept downstairs and one of the fi ve girls, her name was Sarka, she found herself a r -- a Russian officer. She was a very enterprising young lady. The four of us were scared, four poor souls, so the four of us were upstairs, upstairs there was a bed, big, big bed, and the boys pulled the ladder down and we stayed up there at night. And the same night, we have hear d German voices, and we thought that the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 8Germans came back. The Polish boys jumped out of the window. The house faced a small forest, a young forest, and evidently some of the soldiers who ran away, they were hiding. They were hungry, so they broke to this kitchen to eat. So the Polish boys jumped from the window because they were downstairs, and they ran to the Russian commandantura to tell them that th e ru -- there are Germans in the house. And we hear the Russians coming, and we understand them because the Russian and Polish are -- are Slavic languages, the -- the roots are sort of -- you could understand. They wanted to throw --"

Here we survived the Nazi camp, here we are so-called liberated, here are the Germans downstairs and the Russians want to kill us. The -- the situation was absolutely unbelievable. The Germans tried to escape through the kitchen door to the -- through the garden, and they were shot by the Russians, both of them. And the two bodies were for two days lying there. After that day, my fear was so intense, that I did not want to stay with the girls.

We have to -- to chance. Or maybe we\u2122ll find somebody who is decent enough to help us. And we still have these vodka, covered of course, because the Russians and vodka, it\u2122s -- we walked -- they were making remarks as we were passing by, and we saw one tall individual in very long coat, reaching his ankles, with a very prominent nose. And we said, do you think he might be Jewish? He was an officer, he had some insignia. And we approached him, and we asked -- we knew the few words in Russian, Ve evrai means Jew in Russian. Ve evrai, and he said da. Oh, that was first relief. We are little Polish, little Russian, we are two girls that are Jewish, the families were killed. We have nobody. We want to leave Poland to go to displaced person camp. He offered to help us. He took us to hi s compartment, took his filthy coat, the dirty pea coat, put us in the corner, and covered us with this -- hanged this on a hook and covered us with th is stinky coat, and he said, don\u2122t make a sound. And when the train started, he gave us some bread. He was very ni -- he -- we USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 17gave him the vodka, we were so delighted. A nd he said he was a dentist, and he said to us, don\u2122t go east, go west. And he said if he would have his wife, which was in one of the Russian cities [indecipherable] he wouldn\u2122t go back either. It -- it\u2122s unbelievable this -- the situations that I wa s involved with, the people that I met, the people that did help me, that -- it\u2122s -- it\u2122s -- it\u2122s -- it\u2122s -- it\u2122s a story after story after story. And we reached Berlin after -- after stopping th -- at the border where we heard screaming because some women were being raped. I suppose German woman were being raped by the Russians, and we were still under that coat, and we reached Berlin station, we got off, we thank him. We found two men that looked to us Jewish, and they were, and they gave -- put us on the bus, they paid the fare, they told us when to get off. Now, both of us spoke German. We got off and that was the first Schlactensee camp that we k -- arrived at."

I was sitting with the chair facing the window, turn around chair, I remember, and they gave the porter extra money to take care of me because I couldn\u2122t speak the language, to bring me food and so forth. And it was a long trip, and when the train arrived in USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 29Detroit, a whole group of people ar -- were awaiting me. Now, at this time, I forgot to mention that when I was leaving Germany, I was still having some ration from the Joint. I had some coffee, cigarettes, and I never smoked. So I decided to change this for some decent clothes. So I received for my cigarettes [indecipherable] some fur coat. Some -- I -- [indecipherable] I-I think it was, and a nice hat, and I looked -- I wanted to look presentable when I was arriving. So when I arrived in Detroit in this coat, and white gloves, and I looked -- I suppose I was already nourished because in -- Joint gave us food, and in -- in New Jersey I was getting good food and care.

Who -- of course, I didn\u2122t speak English, but here I looked like a lady. And they brought me home. The older lady and her husband were very nice and they spoke some German, so there was some communication. But they had only daughter who was, well, I must say she had two degrees from various universities, but that doesn\u2122t make a person very bright, or very polite. And she made my life miserabl e. She resented me. I was the attention gathering point. My -- that -- that -- the daughter-in-law of this old lady that died wanted to be very nice to me. She was very nice lady. She was patroness of arts and music, and I could communicate with her because I loved it. And her daughter resented every single thing that I -- I did or said. They sent me to a night school to learn English. And this was a class composed of elderly people who came here very early as -- I suppose i-in the 1910 or 20\u2122s. They worked all their lives and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 30now that they were retired they were -- wanted to learn the proper language. So after a few weeks, the teacher said, my dear, this is not a class for you, because y-you will learn rapidly in a different class. And I stopped going there.

I was so partial to it that sometimes it USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 46scared me, because the doctor said I should -- if I attempt to have a child, I shouldn\u2122t have -- try again, because of my health. So I said, oh, if there is any power, anything -- I wanted a daughter because a daughter usually is closer to mother than a son. And when I had a daughter, I was absolutely in seventh heaven. At that time my husband worked nights because he had 15 percent bonus for working nights. We lived in New York, and I lived on this fourth floor. And of course my pains came in the middle of the night when he wasn\u2122t home.

I walked with this little luggage, with the pain, and they ask me, are you married? Because who comes alone to have a baby in the middle of the night. So I said, what do you think? So this was funny. And of course, after I had my -- my daughter, I was absolutely deliriously happy. And I totally devoted myself to bringing her up. And the result is good. It paid off. And we are very close. We share many interests. Well, they are diverse. For instance, our taste in literature is a little different.

We wanted our children to be educated, and th -- to have a decent upbrin ging. I learned how to play Mahjong. And I played Mahjong with the ladies. And they were one Italian lady, Connie, whom I adore, and three Jewish ladies, one in my building, two across the street. It was safe to walk out on the street in the evening. When I took my baby in the carriage, we walked to that park in the evening because it was hot, there was no air conditioning, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 48and the apartment was s-stifling, and nobody was afraid because the times were different.

People don\u2122t know, there are so many free. We used to go to Lewison stadium those days for free concerts. I t ook the baby in the blanket and we were sitting like in a amphitheater, around, and listen to concerts. It was free, it was wonderful. So if you partake of what the city could offer you, it is not the amount of money that people try to amass more, the greed is so enormous. They never have enough. My priority was not to amassing we alth, but wealth of cultural things, of good life, and I hope that in some measure, I achieved it."

This I have to say, I have to mention this. For somebody who is not religious, when I walked in Jerusalem, this was one of the biggest impacts on my life. When I touched the wall, something happened to me, because it was like a link in history. I touched the wall that for so many years was important to my history. I remember my grandfather having the sign for Jerusalem in his room, because every Jew\u2122s hope was someday to be in Jerusalem. I walked the streets that Christ allegedly walked, the 14 station of cross, and something happened to me. I was walking on the cobbled streets that Jesus walked. It was important to me, historically. I went to the Mosque, to the Grand Mosque. I took my shoes off, paid my respects. I went there and I went down and I saw the huge rack that was supposed to be the sacrificial -- he was supposed to sacrifice his son there, Isaac, and God stopped him.

Because they were -- majority were men, but there a couple of women lieutenants, too. And then there was a question answer period , and the qu -- two questions which very frequently come up were asked there as well. And one of them was how did we permit this to happen to us. And of course , the answer is very incomprehensible to them, but I try my very best to tell them that the circumstances under which we were kept completely prevented us from doing anyt hing. There were a couple of revolts in some camps, I believe, small, that the peop le were able to get some guns, some ammunition, and even the Warsaw ghetto had revolt. But in L\u00f3dz ghetto, for instance, where I was, it was impossible. We were surrounded by very anti-Semitic population. We could not get a ny gun for the life of it. We were -- as a matter of fact, the people were rejoicing seeing our terrible situation. So -- and we were starved. Now, if you are starved, you don\u2122t have strength to pi ck up anything, how can you fight? That\u2122s why people were committing su icides, a lot of them. Besides the spirit was completely broken when you saw members of your family and children being USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 57taken away, and knew -- by that time you al ready knew that they were going to places where they were disposed of like a -- like a vermin. The second question that very often I am asked is if I can forgive. I believe that I even spoke about it on my videotape, and this question has two prongs. The people who committed these horrible acts, and destroyed human beings, mu rder human beings, no I cannot forgive them, and I never will. But the other people, the other German people, who did not participate, who were born after the war, who help, like Jehovah Witnesses, there is nothing to forgive. They did not do anythi ng wrong.

So when I ask them to close their eyes and try for a moment to visualize me as they are now, a-as I once was. I was a young girl, and I had shared the same inte rests as they do now.

Thank you for coming to our school and telling us about the way it was for you in the World War . It meant a lot to me. My views on white supremacy and hating people of other ethnic backgrounds were changed. Your presentation helped me realize a lot of things that I never even thought of. I felt terrible to think my boyfriend of a year and a half, worshipped the man, the same kind of a man that broke your back, or hit your grandmother. I\u2122m very sorry for many things I have said and done. I feel ashamed, ashamed for the SS tattooed on my hand. There are a lot of young people such as me who never even stop ped to think of the real terrors. I know you made a great impression on my mind, a nd I had stopped to th ink of the things that I have said and done. Sincerely, C. Hale.\ufb02 Now, the letter is grammatically very poorly written, especially for a high school student in an affluent area. However, I made a dent in her way of thinking. I made her think, and that is extremely important to me. She thought well enough of it to sit down and write to me. That means that she -- she some -- some sort of changed occurred in her. Now, even s -- even small change. If she asks me to please continue speaking to people like her, that means that I have done some good."

The student had already begun to bring the Holocaust, the human capacity for genocide, and the responsibility of the bystander into discussion about current social injustices around the world. They had started to question their own complicity.

I -- I was absolutely delighted with the creation of this museum, because it is a tremendous tool, not only of showing people what ha s happened, but as a tool for educating people for the future, how to learn to get along. How to -- how to see things from the perspective of different human beings, pe ople who went through it, people who did help, people who taught about it. The museum has testimonies of so many survivors, and they range from people who can hardly express themselves to people who are very articulate and who can just bare their soul, and try to teach the listeners, and open their eyes and ears and teach them the lessons.

            "question": "I\u2122ve heard some survivors be quite critical, though, of the fact that this is not a museum solely dedicated to Jewish survivors. Ho-How do you feel about that?",
            "answer": "No, I disagree strongly. I disagree beca use then it would defeat the purpose. If it would be only to perpetuate the Jewish Holocaust, it would be very parochial. I think that the museum is a warning and teaching experience for people of all persuasions all around the world, of all the people who can have the access to the museum. It is a morally and ethically marvelous tool, becaus e it exposes people to -- not only to the evil, but also to the goodness. It exposes people to the teaching of the survivors like myself, what did they learn, and what did they want to tell the future generations? Because we as survivors are getting old, and we are dying out, and we will be the last ones who will be heard from."

            "answer": "I don\u2122t think so. I disagree. This is my point of view. You can never take away from the culture by teaching people how to ge t along with other people. It is this -- my individual understanding, and I hope by -- that people who will listen to me will agree with me, that the museum, it was created for the purpose of teaching people to avoid in the future, genocides not only of Jewish people, but all the people everywhere on this earth. Unfortunately, we have the bad examples occurring now throughout the world. And this museum t eaches people how to -- how to understand USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 74this, and how to avoid. How can the museum be a -- a -- o-only preaching about the Jewish genocide? There\u2122s genocide now going on."

Was -- do you think there was a certain turning point, or -- yeah, well, that\u2122s the first point of my question.",
            "answer": "I think that many of the survivors who became successful in their private lives were very instrumental in pushing the idea of creating this museum, and they were able to support it financially. And ever since that time -- there are other museums in different countries that are being spurred by the idea of the -- of the Washington Holocaust Museum."

            "answer": "Well, I\u2122m not too fond of them because they could never really portray the true Holocaust. The movie \ufb01Holocaust\ufb02 that was in three or four parts, was a -- a -- a fairy tale, absolutely pointless. On the other hand, \ufb01Schindler\u2122s List\ufb02 was a teaching tool. I feel that Schindler deserved to be mentioned because no matter what his motives in the beginning were -- he was a businessman who wanted to cash in on, and make money. However, eventually, by seeing the in justice and the h-horror of the German authorities, he changed his mind and he became instrumental in saving people. So this fi-film I believe it -- it was worthwhile. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0057 75"
