            "answer": "Yes, Just prior to the liberation I was 1n so-called [indecipherable] which means in English, a sick bay.

We were not really sure who were they, but we were -- we were subjected to bombardments and the Germans closed us in the barrack, and the -- the doors were locked and the windows were covered, and we were not let out to work, and as well with the sick bay. Since this came so rapidly, they did not have time to dispose of us, because the plan was to somehow eradicated the camp with the inmates. I was brought from the sick bay to the main barrack when they closed it. And the following day, or two days later, one of the girls looked through the window, the -- the shutter, and she have seen that the towers where the German soldiers were usually with -- watching us, ar -- they were absent, nobody was there. So they decided to break the door open and run. And the ones who could, ran to the kitchen. They brought us some very silly foods, margarine, one egg, I think, a couple of potatoes and we stayed for awhile there. We had very mixed emotions because we didn\u2019t know what to do. However, we decided that the safest thing for us would be to leave the camp, since it was abandoned by the Germans. This was the supposedly moment of the liberation, and we didn\u2019t feel liberated yet. It was very strange feeling. We went across the street, my friends helped me."

We went inside, it was abandoned as well. And there were, I think, seven of us, and one girl has -- had a mother with her yet. And they brought the food, and somebody was preparing the food, and all of a sudden the commandant came back with a gun, cocked the gun, aimed at the group of us and of course we were petrified, we thought that\u2019s the end. And this big, strong man with the gun was afraid of us. And he backed out and disappeared. At that moment we thought the safest thing would be to leave his house and go towards the fire, because this indicated that whoever is fighting, is a liberator."

We passed a field, 1t was street or a field, there were two young men there, and they joined us. These were two Polish men who worked there during the war as hands at the farms because Germany needed laborers, and they joined us. Since we were from Poland, we spoke Polish, so the seven of us reached the front line. Unbelievable, unbelievable sight. The first soldiers that we -- soldier that we saw was of Asiatic origin, I believe, some Mongol maybe, with the eyes that make seem that he\u2019s Asiatic. And he was with the dirty uniform, filthy. And we kissed his boots. I remember that moment. And he motioned with his hands for us to go in the back. We went in the back, they told us that we can help ourselves to food, which was in a barrel, there were herrings. We ate some of This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So we reached a house -- this was a village, finally, and we reached the very first house, which had a slightly damaged roof, I believe, and we went in. And it -- since the fighting go -- was going on, we decided to go to the basement. They had the basement, which was very, very well appointed. They had two sort of cots to sleep, with -- with linen on them, and they were -- the walls were lined with shelves, and the shelves had all sorts of jars with conserves and meat and -- and fruit. And in the other part of the basement there were barrels. They were potatoes, carrots, and water. So, ever -- and -- and there were some candles. So they were really very well prepared. And of course we ate some of the stuff, and we lied down. And that basement was approachable by a swing door up and down, that\u2019s all I remember, up and down. And at some point during the night, the door swang open and two Russians came, and they demanded girls. I believe that at least one of them was drunk, because he pulled up his gun and started to shoot at the jars. Now, I said to myself, when I survived the five years, or over five years of war, and I\u2019m still alive, I\u2019m not going to be subjected to that, I\u2019d rather die.

I was lying on this cot, and he covered me, and he sat down on top of me. And the other girl did the same, and one went in the back room where the barrels were, and two girls were raped. Now the -- the Russian who was shooting at the jars, was laughing like a child. To him this was absolutely normal. Women and men were made to -- to mate. So there was nothing strange to him. He couldn\u2019t understand that -- that we hated it, that we couldn't understand it. I remember that the pieces of the broken jars, the glass, embedded in my left leg, and I still have the scars. And I didn\u2019t make a peep, not a sound, because I wanted to survive, so I was quiet. One of the girls became hysterical; her name was Blanka, I remember her, she was the youngest. She became hysterical and she started to scream, so the Russian took a candle, put the light on -- lit the candle and brought her some water.

Extraordinary. The next morning we decided to leave this place for something safer, and we walked through the village, found another house. They were -- all the houses were abandoned by the Germans who were running towards the American line, or English line. They did not want to be captured by the Russians. And the cows and the pigs were not fed so they were making sounds. We got into a house, we made ourselves comfortable, we ate. The two boys went to the garden and they chased some chickens, we cooked the chickens. After we finished eating we took the tablecloth with the china and threw it out of the window. That was -- this was the little revenge. We didn\u2019t want to wash the dishes, we didn\u2019t know what will happen. It didn\u2019t feel like we are liberated. There was not the sense of freedom yet. Oh, first of all, the war was still going on. We were so- called liberated by the Russians, who became in our eyes, another oppressors. So I questioned myself, is -- was this worth it, all my suffering, to arrive at this moment? What\u2019s going to be? What will happen later on? And there was a story about -- I believe that I had on media tape, that we were so scared of the Russians that at night we took a ladder and we went to the attic, and we slept in the attic, four of us. The two boys slept downstairs and one of the five girls, her name was Sarka, she found herself a r -- a Russian officer. She was a very enterprising young lady. The four of us were scared, four poor souls, so the four of us were upstairs, upstairs there was a bed, big, big bed, and the boys pulled the ladder down and we stayed up there at night.

The Polish boys jumped out of the window. The house faced a small forest, a young forest, and evidently some of the soldiers who ran away, they were hiding. They were hungry, so they broke to this kitchen to eat.

Here we survived the Nazi camp, here we are so-called liberated, here are the Germans downstairs and the Russians want to kill us. The -- the situation was absolutely unbelievable. The Germans tried to escape through the kitchen door to the- through the garden, and they were shot by the Russians, both of them. And the two bodies were for two days lying there.

It was combined with a sense of deep guilt that I was the one who survived. Why I? I didn\u2019t feel worth it. There were people who were better in my family than I, and they didn\u2019t survive. They were younger, and some older. How did I go -- how did I have this burst of energy to proceed to leave Poland, to think about it? Maybe it was the -- the deep sense of bitterness towards people that I knew before the war who betrayed me, because I thought this was betrayal. These were people who were coming to my home, sleeping and eating, and I was helping them with work. I was fairly good student. And they did not know me when the war started. So leaving Poland was not as traumatic because there was nothing that I was leaving behind."

We were not- we were not related, but we were both Fisher. We decided to leave Poland and my friend, in whose home I was staying, said to me, you know, I'll give you a couple of zlotys, which was the Polish money, very little, and she gave me two bottle of vodka. She said, this is a very good trading mark with the Russians, if you need it. And it proved to be true.

The two of us went, we reached Posen -- Posinine -- Polish Posnine, Posen in German, a university city which was on -- near the border, and we wanted to board a train which was going to Germany. Now how do you board the train when you have no money or anything? Just so happened on this station, there -- there were -- the whole Russian contingent of soldiers were sitting around waiting for this train. And Irka and I decided to find one of the Russians, maybe he\u2019s Jewish, so he would help us. So we said to -- how do you find the Jew? How does Jew look like? Wha -- wa -- how we can judge? We have to -- to chance. Or maybe we\u2019|l find somebody who is decent enough to help us. And we still have these vodka, covered of course, because the Russians and vodka, it\u2019s -- we walked -- they were making remarks as we were passing by, and we saw one tall individual in very long coat, reaching his ankles, with a very prominent nose. And we said, do you think he might be Jewish? He was an officer, he had some insignia. And we approached him, and we asked -- we knew the few words in Russian, Ve evrai means Jew in Russian. Ve evrai, and he said da. Oh, that was first relief. We are little Polish, little Russian, we are two girls that are Jewish, the families were killed. We have nobody. We want to leave Poland to go to displaced person camp. He offered to help us. He took us to his compartment, took his filthy coat, the dirty pea coat, put us in the corner, and covered us with this -- hanged this on a hook and covered us with this stinky coat, and he said, don\u2019t make a sound.

I was picked up at the pier, and I stayed with them, since Detroit was busy with the funeral and the mourning period. I stayed for couple of weeks in New Jersey, and I developed a very warm friendship with the great-uncle, and his wife, who was an elder -- elderly, charming lady, speaking few languages, and she endeared herself to me, because she made me feel at home. It was warm, it was not anything material that I needed, I needed -- I needed love and affection, and that\u2019s what she gave me. But after couple of weeks they sent for me to go to Detroit. They put me on a train in a very beautiful, luxurious car. I was sitting with the chair facing the window, turn around chair, I remember, and they gave the porter extra money to take care of me because I couldn\u2019t speak the language, to bring me food and so forth.

Who -- of course, I didn\u2019t speak English, but here I looked like a lady. And they brought me home. The older lady and her husband were very nice and they spoke some German, so there was some communication. But they had only daughter who was, well, I must say she had two degrees from various universities, but that doesn\u2019t make a person very bright, or very polite. And she made my life miserable. She resented me. I was the attention gathering point. My -- that -- that -- the daughter-in-law of this old lady that died wanted to be very nice to me. She was very nice lady. She was patroness of arts and music, and I could communicate with her because I loved it. And her daughter resented every single thing that I -- I did or said.

So if you partake of what the city could offer you, it is not the amount of money that people try to amass more, the greed is so enormous. They never have enough.

Because they were -- majority were men, but there a couple of women lieutenants, too. And then there was a question answer period, and the qu -- two questions which very frequently come up were asked there as well. And one of them was how did we permit this to happen to us. And of course, the answer is very incomprehensible to them, but I try my very best to tell them that the circumstances under which we were kept completely prevented us from doing anything. There were a couple of revolts in some camps, I believe, small, that the people were able to get some guns, some ammunition, and even the Warsaw ghetto had revolt. But in Lodz ghetto, for instance, where I was, it was impossible. We were surrounded by very anti-Semitic population. We could not get any gun for the life of it. We were -- as a matter of fact, the people were rejoicing seeing our terrible situation. So -- and we were starved. Now, if you are starved, you don\u2019t have strength to pick up anything, how can you fight? That\u2019s why people were committing suicides, a lot of them.

The second question that very often I am asked 1s if I can forgive. I believe that I even spoke about it on my videotape, and this question has two prongs. The people who committed these horrible acts, and destroyed human beings, murder human beings, no I cannot forgive them, and I never will. But the other people, the other German people, who did not participate, who were born after the war, who help, like Jehovah Witnesses, there is nothing to forgive. They did not do anything wrong.

So when I ask them to close their eyes and try for a moment to visualize me as they are now, a-as I once was. I was a young girl, and I had shared the same interests as they do now.

Thank you for coming to our school and telling us about the way it was for you in the World War II. It meant a lot to me. My views on white supremacy and hating people of other ethnic backgrounds were changed. Your presentation helped me realize a lot of things that I never even thought of. I felt terrible to think my boyfriend of a year and a half, worshipped the man, the same kind of a man that broke your back, or hit your grandmother. I\u2019m very sorry for many things I have said and done. I feel ashamed, ashamed for the SS tattooed on my hand. There are a lot of young people such as me who never even stopped to think of the real terrors. I know you made a great impression on my mind, and I had stopped to think of the things that I have said and done. Sincerely, C. Hale.\u201d Now, the letter is grammatically very poorly written, especially for a high school student in an affluent area. However, I made a dent in her way of thinking. I made her think, and that is extremely important to me. She thought well enough of it to sit down and write to me. That means that she- she some -- some sort of changed occurred in her. Now, even s -- even small change. If she asks me to please continue speaking to people like her, that means that I have done some good."

And one day the lady from The Friend Society called me and asked me if I would mind if she would send a German girl. And I said, by all means send her to me, let her see me as I am.

But as the things progressed, and the dinner, we became quite friendly, and she left as a friend, and that was an accomplishment.

But eventually she saw the transformation of students to deeper understanding. And she said, \u201cThis is the moment that all teachers dream of, and I knew that the class had been successful. It was your visit and your important message that coincided with this success. The student had already begun to bring the Holocaust, the human capacity for genocide, and the responsibility of the bystander into discussion about current social injustices around the world. They had started to question their own complicity. They asked what they could do for Kosovo, for Rwanda, for East Timor, for those suffering on our own soil, and it was your talk, your willingness to speak of your losses and to testify for those who are forever silent. Your dedication to social action that solidified this response from the students. It was invaluable for all students, ranging from those who had never studied the Holocaust to your own granddaughter, to hear a survivor bear witness. All of the students posted lengthy notes about your visit on our email news -- newsgroup.\u201d And I will read a couple of excerpts."

I think that the museum is a warning and teaching experience for people of all persuasions all around the world, of all the people who can have the access to the museum. It is a morally and ethically marvelous tool, because it exposes people to -- not only to the evil, but also to the goodness. It exposes people to the teaching of the survivors like myself, what did they learn, and what did they want to tell the future generations?
