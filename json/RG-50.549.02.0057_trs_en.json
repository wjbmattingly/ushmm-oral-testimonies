            "question": "And I would like to start with the time just before liberation. If you could set for us the context a little bit, where were you, when was it, and what was your physical health and your state of mind at that time. It\u2019s a pretty heavy question, but if you just",
            "answer": "Yes, Just prior to the liberation I was 1n so-called [indecipherable] which means in English, a sick bay. I was lying there with some broken ribs, which I received on the last beating that I got at the hands of the meister, the supervisor from the airplane factory in which I w -- slaved. And at that time the allied forces were closing on the - around our city, Bittenberg. We were not really sure who were they, but we were -- we were subjected to bombardments and the Germans closed us in the barrack, and the -- the doors were locked and the windows were covered, and we were not let out to work, and as well with the sick bay. Since this came so rapidly, they did not have time to dispose of us, because the plan was to somehow eradicated the camp with the inmates. I was brought from the sick bay to the main barrack when they closed it. And the following day, or two days later, one of the girls looked through the window, the -- the shutter, and she have seen that the towers where the German soldiers were usually with -- watching us, ar -- they were absent, nobody was there. So they decided to break the door open and run. And the ones who could, ran to the kitchen. They brought us some very silly foods, margarine, one egg, I think, a couple of potatoes and we stayed for awhile there. We had very mixed emotions because we didn\u2019t know what to do. However, we decided that the safest thing for us would be to leave the camp, since it was abandoned by the Germans. This was the supposedly moment of the liberation, and we didn\u2019t feel liberated yet. It was very strange feeling. We went across the street, my friends helped me."

And they -- as a matter of fact they say, Blanka, another day, another day and we will be free. And we crossed the street. There was the house in which the commandant lived from the camp, with a garden, lovely flowers which I envied when I passed by and saw it. We went inside, it was abandoned as well. And there were, I think, seven of us, and one girl has -- had a mother with her yet. And they brought the food, and somebody was preparing the food, and all of a sudden the commandant came back with a gun, cocked the gun, aimed at the group of us and of course we were petrified, we thought that\u2019s the end. And this big, strong man with the gun was afraid of us. And he backed out and disappeared. At that moment we thought the safest thing would be to leave his house and go towards the fire, because this indicated that whoever is fighting, is a liberator."

            "answer": "I don\u2019t know what happened, but we split. I was in a group of five. Two of the girls were helping me, and the five of us were running. We passed a field, 1t was street or a field, there were two young men there, and they joined us. These were two Polish men who worked there during the war as hands at the farms because Germany needed laborers, and they joined us. Since we were from Poland, we spoke Polish, so the seven of us reached the front line. Unbelievable, unbelievable sight. The first soldiers that we -- soldier that we saw was of Asiatic origin, I believe, some Mongol maybe, with the eyes that make seem that he\u2019s Asiatic. And he was with the dirty uniform, filthy. And we kissed his boots. I remember that moment. And he motioned with his hands for us to go in the back. We went in the back, they told us that we can help ourselves to food, which was in a barrel, there were herrings. We ate some of the herrings, we got very sick from it because the bodies were empty -- the stomachs, rather, were empty. And there was no water because the pipes weren\u2019t working. So -- but we were pretty sick, in pretty bad shape."

            "answer": "Long herrings, long herrings. And then they -- they told us to leave. This was the front line after all, they were being shot and they shot back. So we reached a house -- this was a village, finally, and we reached the very first house, which had a slightly damaged roof, I believe, and we went in. And it -- since the fighting go -- was going on, we decided to go to the basement. They had the basement, which was very, very well appointed. They had two sort of cots to sleep, with -- with linen on them, and they were -- the walls were lined with shelves, and the shelves had all sorts of jars with conserves and meat and -- and fruit. And in the other part of the basement there were barrels. They were potatoes, carrots, and water. So, ever -- and -- and there were some candles. So they were really very well prepared. And of course we ate some of the stuff, and we lied down. And that basement was approachable by a swing door up and down, that\u2019s all I remember, up and down. And at some point during the night, the door swang open and two Russians came, and they demanded girls. I believe that at least one of them was drunk, because he pulled up his gun and started to shoot at the jars. Now, I said to myself, when I survived the five years, or over five years of war, and I\u2019m still alive, I\u2019m not going to be subjected to that, I\u2019d rather die. So I ask one of the Polish boys to save me, and I said to him, look, tell them that I\u2019m -- pretend I\u2019m your wife. I was lying on this cot, and he covered me, and he sat down on top of me. And the other girl did the same, and one went in the back room where the barrels were, and two girls were raped. Now the -- the Russian who was shooting at the jars, was laughing like a child. To him this was absolutely normal. Women and men were made to -- to mate. So there was nothing strange to him. He couldn\u2019t understand that -- that we hated it, that we couldn't understand it. I remember that the pieces of the broken jars, the glass, embedded in my left leg, and I still have the scars. And I didn\u2019t make a peep, not a sound, because I wanted to survive, so I was quiet. One of the girls became hysterical; her name was Blanka, I remember her, she was the youngest. She became hysterical and she started to scream, so the Russian took a candle, put the light on -- lit the candle and brought her some water. And he put the compress, cold compress on her forehead, he said, okay. When the morning finally arrived --"

And she was quiet. She was raped. She came from a very religious family, Jewish religious family, so in the morning she did not tell us that she was raped, but we knew she was raped, because you -- you could hear the sounds. Extraordinary. The next morning we decided to leave this place for something safer, and we walked through the village, found another house. They were -- all the houses were abandoned by the Germans who were running towards the American line, or English line. They did not want to be captured by the Russians. And the cows and the pigs were not fed so they were making sounds. We got into a house, we made ourselves comfortable, we ate. The two boys went to the garden and they chased some chickens, we cooked the chickens. After we finished eating we took the tablecloth with the china and threw it out of the window. That was -- this was the little revenge. We didn\u2019t want to wash the dishes, we didn\u2019t know what will happen. It didn\u2019t feel like we are liberated. There was not the sense of freedom yet. Oh, first of all, the war was still going on. We were so- called liberated by the Russians, who became in our eyes, another oppressors. So I questioned myself, is -- was this worth it, all my suffering, to arrive at this moment? What\u2019s going to be? What will happen later on? And there was a story about -- I believe that I had on media tape, that we were so scared of the Russians that at night we took a ladder and we went to the attic, and we slept in the attic, four of us. The two boys slept downstairs and one of the five girls, her name was Sarka, she found herself a r -- a Russian officer. She was a very enterprising young lady. The four of us were scared, four poor souls, so the four of us were upstairs, upstairs there was a bed, big, big bed, and the boys pulled the ladder down and we stayed up there at night. And the same night, we have heard German voices, and we thought that the Germans came back. The Polish boys jumped out of the window. The house faced a small forest, a young forest, and evidently some of the soldiers who ran away, they were hiding. They were hungry, so they broke to this kitchen to eat. So the Polish boys jumped from the window because they were downstairs, and they ran to the Russian commandantura to tell them that the ru -- there are Germans in the house. And we hear the Russians coming, and we understand them because the Russian and Polish are -- are Slavic languages, the -- the roots are sort of -- you could understand. They wanted to throw --"

And we, all four of us, crept underneath the big bed, we\u2019re lying underneath the bed, and Blanka, the youngest one who -- who -- who was hysterical before, she wet herself and we were lying down there in the urine, not even thinking about it. Here we survived the Nazi camp, here we are so-called liberated, here are the Germans downstairs and the Russians want to kill us. The -- the situation was absolutely unbelievable. The Germans tried to escape through the kitchen door to the- through the garden, and they were shot by the Russians, both of them. And the two bodies were for two days lying there. After that day, my fear was so intense, that I did not want to stay with the girls. The next house ha-had French prison -- ex- prisoners of war, and I moved with them, they said they would take care of me, and they did."

And there were people from Poland who walked with little carts and Polish flags, towards Poland. And I decided that I will join them. There were carts, so I had some rides for awhile. And after tearful good-byes with the French people, that I will never forget, I left. And we walked, and walked, and then they had the horse once. So the horse pull -- pulled the cart and I was in it. We reached a city called Lignitsa, which used to belong to German and became Polish, so I don\u2019t remember what the name was previous to it.

So I went through -- through the closets with my friends, and I remember that I wore, I think it was a man\u2019s shirt, blue, long-sleeve shirt, and some sort of a skirt. Some people were looking for watches, for thi -- I -- I didn\u2019t think about it. I just wanted to see my family. When we reached Warsaw, which was bombed to rubble, and they left me there, I didn\u2019t know what to do, how to reach my city, Lodz. I have no money, I have no possessions, I -- I\u2019m -- you see me, that\u2019s how I am. And there was a truck, a Polish man who had a sign he\u2019s going to Lodz. So I ask him if he could take me. And I said I have no money. He said okay. These times were different. People had some sort of -- I don\u2019t know, not obligation, but they felt like helping one another, because the survivors were streaming back. So this man ow -- took me to his truck, and the funny part of it is that he stopped in one city and he left the truck to go to eat, and he didn\u2019t think that I -- of me, that I\u2019m hungry.

We -- he let me out on a street, after all, this is my city, and Lodz was not really destroyed, because ra -- Lodz was occupied after few days. It\u2019s not too far from the German border, so it was occupied pretty much untouched. Few buildings I think we lost, and I knew my way around. So I went to m -- he -- he dropped me off in my vicinity on the -- the house that I lived in, the Dineska, 31A, still stood, very nice house, four story house, a corner. And I went in and there was the superintendent who works for us, because the building belonged to my family. And he crossed himself when he saw me. His greeting to me was surprise, and why did I return, how did I survive, and why did I come back? He said, you can\u2019t go upstairs because people live there, and the Germans took everything out of your place, everything. Carpets, and -- there is nothing left. But I said I w -- I still would like to go -- did somebody come back? Anybody came here? He said nobody did. But I still walked to my apartment and rang the bell, and they wouldn\u2019t let me in, the people who lived there. You see, Polish people were not really very friendly, and this is mi -- putting mildly. I went downstairs and the st -- intendent -- the superintendent of the building told me that two blocks away, or three blocks away, there was a office by Jewish -- I don\u2019t know if this was HIAS, Jewish committee set up an office, and there were lists of people who came back, or who inquired, or who survived, and that\u2019s where I went. And when I s-scanned the list, I didn\u2019t see any names from my family, any at all, but I saw a name of my school girlfriend, and her address, which was not too far. And I went to her apartment. She lived with her husband, she was very happy to see me. She survived with her husband, she got married in ghetto. And when ghetto was being liquidated completely, after the great liquidations, there were two groups left. One group that I was with my mother in the hospital in on Wargevnitska. And the second group of 500 people, I believe, on Iyakuba in hiding. This 1s the only group that did not leave fa -- Lodz, and survived in hiding because the Russians came to Poland just in time. We were taken at the last moment, in November."

Maybe it was the -- the deep sense of bitterness towards people that I knew before the war who betrayed me, because I thought this was betrayal. These were people who were coming to my home, sleeping and eating, and I was helping them with work. I was fairly good student. And they did not know me when the war started.

And it -- they came in the -- just the right moment. When I decided to leave with my friend Irka, her name was Irka, and strangely enough we shared the last name. We were not- we were not related, but we were both Fisher. We decided to leave Poland and my friend, in whose home I was staying, said to me, you know, I'll give you a couple of zlotys, which was the Polish money, very little, and she gave me two bottle of vodka. She said, this is a very good trading mark with the Russians, if you need it. And it proved to be true. We were not bothered by any luggage because we had no possessions, neither one of us. Can you imagine this? I still wonder about it. The two of us went, we reached Posen -- Posinine -- Polish Posnine, Posen in German, a university city which was on -- near the border, and we wanted to board a train which was going to Germany. Now how do you board the train when you have no money or anything? Just so happened on this station, there -- there were -- the whole Russian contingent of soldiers were sitting around waiting for this train. And Irka and I decided to find one of the Russians, maybe he\u2019s Jewish, so he would help us. So we said to -- how do you find the Jew? How does Jew look like? Wha -- wa -- how we can judge? We have to -- to chance. Or maybe we\u2019|l find somebody who is decent enough to help us. And we still have these vodka, covered of course, because the Russians and vodka, it\u2019s -- we walked -- they were making remarks as we were passing by, and we saw one tall individual in very long coat, reaching his ankles, with a very prominent nose. And we said, do you think he might be Jewish? He was an officer, he had some insignia. And we approached him, and we asked -- we knew the few words in Russian, Ve evrai means Jew in Russian. Ve evrai, and he said da. Oh, that was first relief. We are little Polish, little Russian, we are two girls that are Jewish, the families were killed. We have nobody. We want to leave Poland to go to displaced person camp. He offered to help us. He took us to his compartment, took his filthy coat, the dirty pea coat, put us in the corner, and covered us with this -- hanged this on a hook and covered us with this stinky coat, and he said, don\u2019t make a sound. And when the train started, he gave us some bread. He was very ni -- he -- we gave him the vodka, we were so delighted. And he said he was a dentist, and he said to us, don\u2019t go east, go west. And he said if he would have his wife, which was in one of the Russian cities [indecipherable] he wouldn\u2019t go back either. It -- it\u2019s unbelievable this -- the situations that I was involved with, the people that I met, the people that did help me, that -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a story after story after story. And we reached Berlin after -- after stopping th -- at the border where we heard screaming because some women were being raped. I suppose German woman were being raped by the Russians, and we were still under that coat, and we reached Berlin station, we got off, we thank him. We found two men that looked to us Jewish, and they were, and they gave -- put us on the bus, they paid the fare, they told us when to get off. Now, both of us spoke German. We got off and that was the first Schlactensee camp that we k -- arrived at."

There were young kids spread around with the legs sticking out, they wouldn\u2019t dream of getting up. I couldn\u2019t under -- this. In my mind, I criticized this. I ate differently, I used my fork and knife differently. I was different. It took me time. Not that -- funny part is I learned to eat chicken drumstick with my hand now, and I think it\u2019s very comfortable. I really like it. But I wouldn\u2019t dare to do it at home. No, the beginning was tough. And the lack of the -- the knowledge of the language makes it very tough. And then you see people who even were kind towards the newcomers, still called us uh -- these are the -- they don\u2019t know much, they\u2019re from Poland, what do they know? And I thought to myself, they don\u2019t really know me. They don\u2019t know my potential, and to them I was -- I was just the newcomer, a displaced person. What is a displaced person? A person who was chased away from somewhere and came here in order to rebuild their life. But that person, even though may not use your language yet, or your customs, can be equal, or sometimes even maybe superior to the people who criticize her. So the beginning wasn\u2019t easy."

            "answer": "Well, when I had my child, it wasn\u2019t easy. I was very happy because I had the child, and I wanted a daughter the worst way. I was so partial to it that sometimes it scared me, because the doctor said I should -- if I attempt to have a child, I shouldn\u2019t have -- try again, because of my health. So I said, oh, if there is any power, anything- | wanted a daughter because a daughter usually is closer to mother than a son. And when I had a daughter, I was absolutely in seventh heaven. At that time my husband worked nights because he had 15 percent bonus for working nights. We lived in New York, and I lived on this fourth floor. And of course my pains came in the middle of the night when he wasn\u2019t home. So we had prepared a telephone near my -- telephone- maternity [indecipherable] sort of, and I called him, and the man downstairs came, he says, come down. I says what do you mean come down, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I have pains. I -- I had to walk down with my little piece of luggage down. It was a plain man with a car, who made himself maternity -- and he took me to the hospital in the middle of the night. I walked with this little luggage, with the pain, and they ask me, are you married? Because who comes alone to have a baby in the middle of the night. So I said, what do you think? So this was funny. And of course, after I had my -- my daughter, I was absolutely deliriously happy. And I totally devoted myself to bringing her up. And the result is good. It paid off. And we are very close. We share many interests. Well, they are diverse. For instance, our taste in literature is a little different. And I adopted some love of the new music, because after all I had a teenager home, a girl, so I could tolerate The Beatles, for instance. But when the new groups started coming, I couldn\u2019t take this, quite. You know, it -- an-and especially now, it -- it\u2019s a lot of vulgarity and -- and in the movements and in the -- in the lyrics, so-called. And this 1s -- this is totally u-undesirable."

And I was pregnant. We arranged rides from city to city, sharing expenses until we reached -- reached New York.

We moved to this building in the Bronx, and there were no survivors that I knew in that building, but we became then the really good friends, because we were in the same, at that time, little lower middle class financially people, but with the same hopes and aspirations. We wanted our children to be educated, and th -- to have a decent upbringing. I learned how to play Mahjong. And I played Mahjong with the ladies. And they were one Italian lady, Connie, whom I adore, and three Jewish ladies, one in my building, two across the street. It was safe to walk out on the street in the evening. When I took my baby in the carriage, we walked to that park in the evening because it was hot, there was no air conditioning, and the apartment was s-stifling, and nobody was afraid because the times were different. And we -- I met the other mothers with carriages there. And the -- it wasn\u2019t easy, but it was a happy time, because I had what I wanted. Of course, financially was a little difficult. We never hit if off really, but it -- it -- it -- it didn\u2019t matter to me that much because I saw what can happen. We had so much and we lost it overnight. So, the priorities changed. What was important was to have good family and enough to eat and be dressed and go to s -- schools are free here, libraries are free here, which is wonderful. People don\u2019t know, there are so many free. We used to go to Lewison stadium those days for free concerts. I took the baby in the blanket and we were sitting like in a amphitheater, around, and listen to concerts. It was free, it was wonderful. So if you partake of what the city could offer you, it is not the amount of money that people try to amass more, the greed is so enormous. They never have enough. My priority was not to amassing wealth, but wealth of cultural things, of good life, and I hope that in some measure, I achieved it."

So we went to his sister. And she had three daughters [indecipherable] were married and the -- the -- the sons-in-law took us with the car, we went to Jerusalem. This I have to say, I have to mention this. For somebody who is not religious, when I walked in Jerusalem, this was one of the biggest impacts on my life. When I touched the wall, something happened to me, because it was like a link in history. I touched the wall that for so many years was important to my history. I remember my grandfather having the sign for Jerusalem in his room, because every Jew\u2019s hope was someday to be in Jerusalem. I walked the streets that Christ allegedly walked, the 14 station of cross, and something happened to me. I was walking on the cobbled streets that Jesus walked. It was important to me, historically. I went to the Mosque, to the Grand Mosque. I took my shoes off, paid my respects. I went there and I went down and I saw the huge rack that was supposed to be the sacrificial -- he was supposed to sacrifice his son there, Isaac, and God stopped him. So all these things that you read - | have books on -- on all the world\u2019s religions here, because I was interested, the impact of Jerusalem, it was very deep, emotionally, spiritually, and -- and I thought to myself, if people only would know -- all three great religions are meet in this little place, if we could learn how to get along. The Arabs say Salaam, and we say Shalom, it\u2019s so much alike. Both are Semitic. Yugoslavia, all these people, it -- it\u2019s religion divides them, why? Why\u2019?"

This was the very first time. Nobody told me about that before, I don\u2019t know why. That people did help, and people paid the supreme sacrifice, that people cared. I thought nobody did.

            "answer": "Well, when I spoke, it was very quiet, they were very intent on listening, they were very polite. And when I finished, I\u2019ve seen few tears, I must say I did. Because they were -- majority were men, but there a couple of women lieutenants, too. And then there was a question answer period, and the qu -- two questions which very frequently come up were asked there as well. And one of them was how did we permit this to happen to us. And of course, the answer is very incomprehensible to them, but I try my very best to tell them that the circumstances under which we were kept completely prevented us from doing anything. There were a couple of revolts in some camps, I believe, small, that the people were able to get some guns, some ammunition, and even the Warsaw ghetto had revolt. But in Lodz ghetto, for instance, where I was, it was impossible. We were surrounded by very anti-Semitic population. We could not get any gun for the life of it. We were -- as a matter of fact, the people were rejoicing seeing our terrible situation. So -- and we were starved. Now, if you are starved, you don\u2019t have strength to pick up anything, how can you fight? That\u2019s why people were committing suicides, a lot of them. Besides the spirit was completely broken when you saw members of your family and children being taken away, and knew -- by that time you already knew that they were going to places where they were disposed of like a -- like a vermin. The second question that very often I am asked 1s if I can forgive. I believe that I even spoke about it on my videotape, and this question has two prongs. The people who committed these horrible acts, and destroyed human beings, murder human beings, no I cannot forgive them, and I never will. But the other people, the other German people, who did not participate, who were born after the war, who help, like Jehovah Witnesses, there is nothing to forgive. They did not do anything wrong. So as I said, there are two parts of this question."

If 1 am in a class of let\u2019s say, junior high students, who are young children, I always tell them to close their eyes in the beginning of my presentation, because what they see in front of them is an elderly lady who has some problems walking, and they cannot relate too much to her. So when I ask them to close their eyes and try for a moment to visualize me as they are now, a-as I once was. I was a young girl, and I had shared the same interests as they do now. I was thinking of my friends, and I was thinking of boys, and of secrets.

Thank you for coming to our school and telling us about the way it was for you in the World War II. It meant a lot to me. My views on white supremacy and hating people of other ethnic backgrounds were changed. Your presentation helped me realize a lot of things that I never even thought of. I felt terrible to think my boyfriend of a year and a half, worshipped the man, the same kind of a man that broke your back, or hit your grandmother. I\u2019m very sorry for many things I have said and done. I feel ashamed, ashamed for the SS tattooed on my hand. There are a lot of young people such as me who never even stopped to think of the real terrors. I know you made a great impression on my mind, and I had stopped to think of the things that I have said and done. Sincerely, C. Hale.\u201d Now, the letter is grammatically very poorly written, especially for a high school student in an affluent area. However, I made a dent in her way of thinking. I made her think, and that is extremely important to me. She thought well enough of it to sit down and write to me. That means that she- she some -- some sort of changed occurred in her. Now, even s -- even small change. If she asks me to please continue speaking to people like her, that means that I have done some good."

If I\u2019m invited -- for instance, I was invited to Duke University twice already. And I went the first time a-absolutely on my cost, because I do not charge for my speaking, I feel this is my obligation, my obligation to -- to those who cannot speak for themselves. The second time I was invited, and I was -- I was provided with a fare and a hotel, which helped. But of course, nothing for the speaking. And I received a booklet, beautifully done, because I spoke for two days. The first day it was in a large auditorium which was filled to capacity. Besides the students, there was also some contingent of faculty and ministers, couple ministers. And the kids who came little bit late, were sitting on the aisles, on the floor, because all the seats were taken. And the second day I spoke in a classroom. This 1s a special course on Holocaust at Duke Institute at this year. And the teacher of the course, Miss [indecipherable] who is Polish, was kind enough to send me a booklet comprised of the letters, he-headed by her own letter, and in which she said that she gave the students a task of instead of a final, to write a letter responding to Mrs. Rothschild. And I have the letters, and this just very special to me, and a copy of it I send -- she sent me two copies, and the second copy I sent to Dr. Ringleheim at the museum."

And then after I speak, and I come home, even though it was very good reception, I always have some thoughts that I omitted something important, that I should have said this or that, and that was of major importance.

And another one was oh -- of -- I get mixed up with my mother. I -- I just cannot say the right -- maybe this is this -- the terrible pain that I have in my heart. And also, once I made a mistake on --in my speaking, when I talked about Bittenberg, which 1s the city that I slaved in Arado airplane factory, and I said that the city had the church on which door the Martin Luther affixed the 1905 thesis. And in one speech I said Martin Luther King. And they couldn\u2019t take that King out, because it was too late."

But some -- dates, for instance, I don\u2019t remember. And I don\u2019t remember what I wore when I left that camp. I called my friend in New York who was also in a camp, she\u2019s, don\u2019t you remember? I said no. Then I -- I ask somebody about something and she said, Blanka, but I was with you.

I was back in Germany couple of times, because the German government recognized that they did impair my health quite badly. They crippled me, and the condition is worsening with age, so a couple of times I was granted a so-called cour. I was in a resort that the doctor treated me, and I received treatments, however what they gave me was not sufficient to cover all the expenses like flight and the hotel, so I had to stop going to Germany for that reason. The treatments were wonderful, much superior to the ones that I\u2019m getting here.

And if they ever ask me anything -- not a person that I met knew about anything, so they were quite innocent. They did not know about the atrocities, they did not hear about the camps. Anyway, the people that I met never, with the exception of the old lady in Berlin after the war, who admitted that she was Nazi and so were all her friends, the doctor and the personnel in the spa were very nice. After all, they were being paid for it, and the people that I met there were friendly with me, but then I met couple of Dutch people there who come in for the same treatment. And there were a couple of people even from Israel that I met there, and the local population I -- I -- I made friends with a man who made me brace, because I have to wear back brace, I just put it on. And in the beginning he -- his reaction was not too friendly, but after awhile when he got to know me, he became very friendly. He and his wife visited us in United States.

So he knew how to -- how to work for the government because he was doing this type of work for war amputees and -- and the braces, not too many people nowadays know this. There\u2019s no industry for making this type of braces, so he was just about one of very few in all of Germany, and he cashed on it. In the beginning why he wasn\u2019t too friendly, well I was somebody strange, and maybe he thought that I resented him. I had to go to him from Bad Kissingen to Schweinhold on train, but the next time when he saw me and he -- he met me, and he sort of liked me, he came with his car to pick me up, and spare me the ride on a train."

And one day the lady from The Friend Society called me and asked me if I would mind if she would send a German girl. And I said, by all means send her to me, let her see me as I am. And she and a Dutch girl came together to our house. She was in the beginning very shy, and very sort of frightened. But as the things progressed, and the dinner, we became quite friendly, and she left as a friend, and that was an accomplishment. Yes, I think that the young people should try to reach and meet, maybe some survivors, or people who- whose family suffered to -- to form a common bond. It\u2019s very important when people try to understand each other. After all, we are all individuals, we are all different.

And she said she had high expectation for the class and student, and she worried, but eventually the class -- she was afraid that the class become desensitized by the narratives of horror. But eventually she saw the transformation of students to deeper understanding. And she said, \u201cThis is the moment that all teachers dream of, and I knew that the class had been successful. It was your visit and your important message that coincided with this success. The student had already begun to bring the Holocaust, the human capacity for genocide, and the responsibility of the bystander into discussion about current social injustices around the world. They had started to question their own complicity. They asked what they could do for Kosovo, for Rwanda, for East Timor, for those suffering on our own soil, and it was your talk, your willingness to speak of your losses and to testify for those who are forever silent. Your dedication to social action that solidified this response from the students. It was invaluable for all students, ranging from those who had never studied the Holocaust to your own granddaughter, to hear a survivor bear witness. All of the students posted lengthy notes about your visit on our email news -- newsgroup.\u201d And I will read a couple of excerpts."

Therefore, I\u2019m going to take from this class, more than the images provoked by any one passage or movie clip, are the words of Mrs. Rothschild. The challenge that we not forget what we have learned, and that we bear some of her burden by passing our knowledge onto our children and peers, so the stories of the Holocaust are never forgotten.\u201d Another student wrote, \u201cI had such a great time talking to her, not only about her Holocaust experiences, but about life in general. I think that it took so much courage and fortitude for her to speak for over 30 years about -- 20 years, about her horrific experience during the war. I just want to finish by saying that I admire Alexis\u2019s grandmother so much for not only coming to talk to us, but for just volunteering to talk to anyone who is willing to listen.

I do not belong to the group which is very active in our city, of -- there is no -- no reason really, I just can\u2019t travel them and I -- I stay in touch with people who help me because I can\u2019t drive, they pick me up and take me with them."

Why do we have to fight? What divides us? We all are of human race, no matter what color, what religious persuasion. We should concentrate on doing the very best to get along and to -- to divert our energy and resources to help eradicate the [indecipherable] that we have spread around the world."

            "answer": "Well -- well, my life as I would have thought when I was young and hope for the future, it\u2019s very different from the one I pictured for myself. For one thing I thought that I will go on with my education to -- to the -- to the nth degree because school was always my -- my favorite. And my health problems prevented me from it. However, I taught myself English well enough to be able to speak about it. And I -- and I educated my daughter in the manner that I wanted to be educated myself.

And I can see that the help is in the form of the letters that I receive from people who listen to me, and in the next generation, my daughter and my granddaughter, who are perpetuating my dream of good life and education and -- and being close to the family."
