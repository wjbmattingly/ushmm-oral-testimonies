            "answer": "Okay. My name is John Meyerstein. I was or iginally called Hans Meyerstein, but when we arrived in England after the St. Louis voyage, it wa s suggested to my parents that -- that they give me an English first name, and the name John was chosen, I\u2122m not sure how, and it\u2122s -- from that moment onwards it became that, and my parent s never used any other name but that, at the time. I currently live in Oakville, Ontario, which is about 20 miles west of Toronto. I was born in Halle, Germany, on the 21 st of March, 1935."

Both my families -- both my parent\u2122s families were financially very well off, and I can only conclude that it was assumed that this would be a good way of having a marriage. My mother never discussed it, in fact she probably talked to my wife year s later on things which she didn\u2122t discuss with me. But how they actually met, and -- I don\u2122t know, I rather think it was a -- an arranged marriage, but how that was done, if -- if my assessment is correct, I have no idea."

My father and his elder brother, Hugo -- and I should say that my father\u2122s younger brother, the one who was killed in 1914 - \u212218, was called Hans, and that wa s why I was originally called Hans, because my grandmother wanted to have a -- a grandson follo wing that name. My father and his elder brother Hugo both served in cal -- cavalry regiments to begin with, and I s -- I don\u2122t know how far the cavalry went, because as you know, things change d, and cavalry re -- regiments then became extinct almost, and presumably went into infant ry regiments. My father\u2122s elder brother Hugo came out at the end of the war as a captain, and my father ended the war, I think, as a second leftenant."

            "answer": "I -- I -- I think they both did, I do not know where they served. I believe it was always on the western front, because I think that my father w ould have mentioned someth ing if -- if -- if it had been elsewhere on the eastern front at that tim e. I have my father\u2122s military b-book, you know, of the class of -- of 19 f -- I can\u2122t think what they call it now, class of 1914, or -- or something like that. But it doesn\u2122t show exactly where all these things were, it wa -- just like a military record book, which I had years later in the British army, wh en I was drafted. But I\u2122ve also since, in the last -- since my father\u2122s death, found my grandf ather\u2122s military book, and he was in the class of 1879, in the militia, in an artillery regiment. So, on my father\u2122s side of the family, military activity was not a -- an unusual activity, despite what the -- the Germans said, that there were that few -- not that many Jews volunteered or f ought, that was totally incorrect. I do recall that my father mentioned to me that he provi -- that his father, my grandfather, provided the horses, and gave them money and so forth, because in th e units which they had to serve, particularly since they ultimately ended up in -- with -- in the commission rank, that required more funding, and my parents were obviously in -- in a position to -- to -- to -- to -- to -- to provide that. The other thing which I found rather interesting, contrary to what I some times read, is that my father, on one or two occasions, and these were things whic h we could always discuss, said to me that when he entered the -- the cavalry regiment, or was in -- was -- w-was organized to go to this unit, that the -- the colonel of the regiment said to him, \ufb01Well, Meyerstein, you can\u2122t say that there are any anti -- anti-Jews here, otherwise you wouldn\u2122t be here.\ufb02 So again, I find it sometimes a bit awkwa -- difficult to understand wh en I read various documents, as to what took 4 -- actually took place. Obviously there were anti -Jewish Germans, and there were Germans who didn\u2122t view this in any shape or form. Whethe r that\u2122s normal, I can\u2122t say actually, you know."

In fact my grandmother, my f-father\u2122s mother, was also born in this -- in Rosslau, and I have the documents, th e birth certificate, and the marriage certificate to my grandf ather, also i-in -- in my file s. And apparently he was quite successful in that respect, and -- and was continued, I think, until the German -- until the Nazis came to power, and of course ultimately that was all taken away from them."

            "question": "Were they just full assimilated [indecipherable]",
            "answer": "Absolute -- I -- I -- I would have to say yes, because I have -- if you look at the birth certificates, and the marriage certif icates of both sides of my gr andparents, you will find that the names are all traditional German names. M-My fa ther is Ludwig. My elder -- his elder brother Hugo, my -- hi-his younger brother Hans, the on e who was killed, and who I was named af -- Hans. My grandmother was named Rosian, which li terally trans -- mean little rose. My -- my grandfather was Max. If you look at his parent\u2122s birth certificates, it\u2122s Magnus, which is really like a Latin name, and the grandmother, I think was -- great-grand -- was Regina. But this also applies to my father\u2122s -- grandmother -- my mo ther\u2122s grandparents in like manner. So when people say to me, well what Jewish names did th ey have, I have to be honest and say I don\u2122t honestly know. My mother, for exampl e is Alice, spelled the same way in English as it is in -- in -- in German, except in German it\u2122s a different pronunciation. So the documents which I have finally found among my father\u2122s papers, after a l ong time, so far I\u2122ve -- I\u2122ve sor -- deciphered that they\u2122ve gone back to about 1822, and they\u2122re all -- the Christian names, the first names, were all literally almost -- you could say either they were English or they were German, but totally integrated. And I suspect that that -- the shock of what subsequent happened, they probably couldn\u2122t believe what was taking place."

And ironically -- Halle is a very big chemical loca -- 6 area, even I think to this day. And i-ironically, which I didn\u2122t real ize, he never discussed it, but my mother mentioned it to me, and also my cous in who lives in Australia, whose mother is my father\u2122s -- was my father\u2122s sister, told me that he was also the outside counsel for I.G. Farben, the big German chemical company, which ultimately made the -- the material which was doing the gas chambers. Course, this all -- we\u2122re not talkin g about that particular period, we\u2122re talking in the -- in the 30\u2122s and so forth.

My -- she had one brother called Lota, and her father was Ludwig Eisner, and my grandmother, my mother\u2122s mother, was Rosa Eisner. They owned what you would call a farm equipment wholesale business. And I have pict ures, I found pictures. I have no idea how they managed to keep these particular pictures, or bring them with them considering all the other problems which they were experiencing. Where my grandfather had -- you could see the trucks outside his -- th-the fi -- th-the family business and home, with the telephone number, and on the truck, branded names of things like percil and so forth, even American products. They did farm equipment, I would sort of say, you know, whic h supplied the farming community, which was 7 predominantly Polish speaking, although this Uppe r S-Silesia was of course Germany, and had been for 150 years or so. And very successful as well."

            "answer": "Well, actually, he was initial -- he was arrested tw ice. The first ti -- my fa -- my father\u2122s sister emigrated with her husband to Australia as a resu lt of friends which they had who -- who helped them there. And one of the -- also from German y, also German Jews. And one of the German Jews had some business things which were required to -- to be handled, and I believe, and this is only -- I\u2122m only surmising this, cause we never di -- I only heard this from my mother, my father took over some activities. This was, or been public perhaps early \u212238 or so. And for some reason or another, you know, at that time, the -- the German government wa s already starting to try and take money, or -- and various other things from -- from German -- from German Jews, and their businesses. And he was arrested and held for six weeks in Halle -- but it was obviously nowhere near anything which subsequently took place -- and was released. And then, I think after Kristall night, which was in the latter part of 1938, my fath er was arrested and taken to Buchenwald. My mother\u2122s father was also arrested and taken to Buchenwald. My father\u2122s -- my mother\u2122s brother, Lota, was also arrested and taken to Buchenwald. And they found each other there, of all -- I mean, most incredible, found each other. All three got out. Now, you have to remember, my father was a first World War veteran, my grandfat her, my mother\u2122s mother -- father was also a veteran. And I have subsequently read books and documents which indicate that the Germans basically said to some of these people, \ufb01Becau se of your activities as, you know, in World War , we\u2122re going to let you go. But you have so many da ys or weeks, and if you are still here in Germany, then we -- if when we re-arrest you ag ain, we\u2122ll never -- you\u2122ll never get out.\ufb02 So I believe my father must have got out, proba bly in early 1939. I don\u2122t know which day, and my 8 grandfather. My Uncle Lota also got out, but I don\u2122t know exactly when, and under what conditions, but they did, and I have proof of the fact, perma -- doc umentation that my father then applied for visa to the United States in, I think, February of 1939. So be tween Kristallnacht and entry into Buchenwald, and now it must have b een somewhere between that time, and shall we say the end of January, or -- so he was rather lucky to get out at that time."

            "answer": "Well, I -- yes, I -- I think you\u2122re right, but I think the motivating factor might have come more from my aunt\u2122s husband, as distinct from other things. My mother has mention -- mentioned to me on several occasions as a boy when I asked qu estions, that I think sometime in \u212238 -- when, I don\u2122t know, I think before Kristallnacht, okay, that the families got together. My father\u2122s family, of which really, was really in my grandmother, because my -- my grandfather on my father\u2122s side, died in 1929, so th -- you know, none of this would have applied, got together, and sort of said what we could -- what -- what should we do, because at that time you still, from what I\u2122ve been given to understand from my mother, you could still take out all your money and belongings without any problems.

Because in those days the Russians used to call people up for military service, and it wasn\u2122t just a two year stint, it was 20 years before they were released.

            "answer": "Okay. I don\u2122t know a great deal of how it wa s done. I can only conclude from my mother\u2122s comments, that the moment my father was releas ed from Buchenwald, and them -- and i-in -- in similar manner, I suspect, al though probably not on the same day, my grandm -- my mother\u2122s fath -- my grandfather on my mother\u2122s side. Th ey didn\u2122t really have mu ch choice about leaving, because that which I\u2122ve read in more recent times would indicate that they were probably told you have a minimum period of time, and if we find you again, you have to go. We\u2122re -- we\u2122re -- we\u2122ll arrest you and -- and you\u2122ll never be let out again. How they got tickets on the St. Louis, who organized that, and in what manner, I don\u2122t know. I do know that my parents -- and this is only what my mother told me, that they already knew that they would have to leave, even though my father and my grandfather were in Buch enwald, something would have to be done, or immediately after Buchenwald. And my grandmot her -- my -- on my moth er\u2122s side, came down from Gutentag, presumably to Halle, and they went -- they bought things, including jewelry, which they sewed -- from what I\u2122m told, stitched into furnitu -- into the furniture, cause in those days, and this is where the anomaly is so incred ible is, you could take everything that you had, or you could buy it. So they took two complete cont ainers, which I would be -- the equivalent of say -- I don\u2122t know what a container in those days would be viewed. Today, two con -- small containers would be 20 foot containers, which I ga ther was furniture, stove, fridge, whatever. In 15 fact, I\u2122ve often wondered about it, and said to my mother, why on earth would you take electrical appliances, that don\u2122t apply when we ended up in -- in -- in England, and -- and so forth. Clo -- everything which they had. And these all came on board the -- the St. Louis with us. We never got them at the end, but I mean, that -- that\u2122s a different story, and we can get to that in due course. How they did that, I don\u2122t know. I think the jewelry, and it was viewed as being a dangerous thing, but they didn\u2122t think that people would -- the -- the Germans would be tearing open the -- the -- the -- the furniture and so forth. They might check your clothing, but they wouldn\u2122t do anything else. And that was -- they hope would, if they got to wherever they were going, they could then sell those things and which -- provide some mo ney. Because as you know, when we left on the St. Louis, I think -- I don\u2122t know what the amount was, probably, you know, five or six U.S. dollars at that time -- or I don\u2122t know, not much more. So in other words, you had money when you -- before you left the ga -- the dockside, you climbed on the St. Louis, and you had nothing left at the time, so we -- we ha d no money on -- on that. Everything had already been paid for on the St. Louis. But how that actually happened, I really don\u2122t know. At th -- it was never explained to me, and I -- I\u2122ve asked my -- I have some cousins in Australia from my mother\u2122s side, and they don\u2122t know. They know even less than I do."

And I -- and when we -- the pictures on the St. Louis with my father, you can see his hair growing back again, but he looked still, quite gaunt.

            "answer": "My mother told me -- well, apparently up to the -- up to the arrival in Cuba, it was -- it was very -- seemed to be very pleasant, in fact unbeli evably, I mean, not that she said that, but when you read the background, you have to really question yourself. Here they are forced out of a country, and suddenly being, you know, provided with -- with -- with a staff, you know, waiters and everything else, at beck and call, considering what was taking place. But I think a great deal, from what I\u2122ve read, or what I\u2122ve heard, would i ndicate that the captain of the St. Louis was an extremely decent individual, and dete rmined to -- he was determined to -- to have this as if there was no -- no animosity against anybo dy in particular. And I believe the -- the Israeli government honored him with a -- with a -- with a medal after th e war, and I\u2122ve also read that as a result of his activities, he was relieved of command when th e St. Louis ultimately returned empty in -- in - to Germany. Never given another command, a lthough he was a career naval officer from World 19 War days. But he was left alone, which is always again, you do -- you\u2122d have thought he\u2122d have been put on trial for being decent to Jews. That did not happen. So I think a lot the -- the -- the way the -- the -- the staff and the crew of the St. Louis conducted themselves, probably in my -- I can only surmise, was the way the captain felt they should handle themselves. So I think the voyage to Cuba probably was very pleasant. The voyage back from Cuba was not so pleasant. My -- my mother told me that things started to go downhill emotionally for people. And I -- I don\u2122t know the name, I can\u2122t recall the name of it, I\u2122m sure it\u2122s listed somewhere, there was one person who threw himself overboard in -- off the St. Louis in -- in -- in the harbor. I think, you know, t-trying to commit suicide, you know. And my mother knew the wi -- or had met the wife of -- of that ba -- if -- if -- if my memory is correct. Ya -- people talked among themselves sometimes, but to what degree I don\u2122t know. On the voyage back, they apparently had to have committees, which were -- the captain requested the men to form, if they were willing, various committees which would -- which would sort of pa trol the decks, certain ly during the night, or during the day and night, to avoid people from tr ying to commit suicide, and my father -- my mother told me that my father was -- was a member of one of these committees. I don\u2122t know what my grandfather, whether he was that way. It\u2122s just that she responded, or she mentioned that to me, because there was serious -- a -- a serious thought by various people that others would perhaps do this. Whether that\u2122s right or wr ong I don\u2122t know, actually. I\u2122m not aware that anybody did do it, but there was that particular feeling. And of course there must have been, and I suspect, although my mother didn\u2122t mention it, a tremendous apprehension as to what was going to happen, because if the sh ip really returned to Hamburg again, then -- or wherever we sailed, the re -- the results w ould have been extremely dire."

And that you could -- you know, it wasn\u2122t a lottery where names were put into a hat. My mother said to me that she perhaps, without ra -- you kn ow, thinking and -- about it, said that she might have been tempted, if it had been her choice, to try to go to France, because as a young teenager, her father had sent her with her brother to do a tour of Europe in the summertime. Lucky for them, they had the money to do it, and that sh e\u2122d gone to France, and she\u2122d gone to Italy, you know, as a young teenager, perhaps in her seven -- at the age of 17 or 18, and because of that -- and she\u2122d learned French at school, not English [indecipherable] that that would have been, because she\u2122d been there once or so, it would ha ve been nice. My father, apparently, paid absolutely no attention to this, and walked to the English table, and sign up, for which there was not a -- initially, not a big demand.

I mean here I\u2122m still at school. I remember we were walking down -- this is quite clear to me -- walking down Oxford Street, which is like Fifth Avenue in New York. It\u2122s a bustling community, you know? It wasn\u2122t exactly empty of people, even in war time. And suddenly we saw, what my mother explained to me, an extremely Orthodox, pious Jew, with a beard and a hat, and I mean, the complete regalia. And my mother stopped to look around, and I had to stop and she said, \ufb01Look at that.\ufb02 And the only people stopping to look were my mother an d myself, and I said, \ufb01Well, wh at is it?\ufb02 And she said, \ufb01But, that\u2122s an Orthodox Jew.\ufb02 And I didn\u2122t quite know what she meant at that time. Well I think afterwards, years later my -- I -- we talked abou t this, my mother and I, is that it was so incredible, nobody paid the slightest attention. It was not an unnatural event. They -- people just all were passing back -- my mother thought it was so unnatural in the -- in the context of what she\u2122d left, to see this. For me, I didn\u2122t really th ink about this until years later, when I began to understand what she really meant. But I rememb er her saying to me, \ufb01That\u2122s a very Orthodox Jew.\ufb02 But I think she, a-as I say, she was wondering whether people would accost him, or -- or affront him, or something.

So, I called my cousin in Australi a, and it was agreed th -- that we would put a claim in for property -- we alrea dy had that done before -- we woul d put in another claim, and we would also put in an insurance claim. And ri ghtly or wrongly, I\u2122ve no means of knowing. But my cousin in Australia said, \ufb01John, will you take care of this?\ufb02 So I sa id yes. Now, she physically is not so well any more. I mentioned the same -- I cal led my two cousins in or -- in Israel, cause they\u2122re the direct grandchildren, like I am, of our grandfather on my mo ther\u2122s side. And said, \ufb01I\u2122ve seen these names, and I\u2122v e seen your father\u2122s name on th eir as well, and my mother\u2122s name. Not my name, not your names, but our -- I think you should -- did you notice?\ufb02 \ufb01No, we didn\u2122t notice.\ufb02 They didn\u2122t even know about this. I said, \ufb01I think you should put some -- a claim in.\ufb02 And both of me -- he said, \ufb01John, you take care of it -- will you take care of it?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Well, I -- a-are you quite happy with this?\ufb02 Be cause in the application forms -- I\u2122d already downloaded them from the computer, and I\u2122d read them through. And of course, don\u2122t forget, it\u2122s all in English, the applications have to be in English, and they\u2122re not normally speaking English at the -- so, it would -- that\u2122s another reason they probably might have thought let John do it, cause he understands the language better. And I said, \ufb01Are you absolutely comfortable,\ufb02 because I said that I will -- I sign as the applicant, and I have to st ate, which I would, and give your addresses of any other relatives who might, should a claim ever be honored, if the -- if there is -- it ever come up, that I undertak e to insure that you were [indecipherable] no question, no doubt in my -- please take care of it, I said, \ufb01I tell you what, in that case I will do it, but I will give you copies of everything,\ufb02 which I did, and to my cousin in Australia. But I said, \ufb01Recognize something, our chances are less than one percent. If you look at it in that light, then you won\u2122t get upset. If nothing happens, if it comes, whic h we -- I doubt very much, then wh -- we\u2122ll see what happens. But if you\u2122re comfortable,\ufb02 -- and they said, \ufb01We\u2122re very comfortable.\ufb02 And from 85 -- and, you know, and somehow or another that s uddenly -- and I\u2122ve wondered to myself whether psychologically they look upon me now as some body who if something devastating were to happen -- and I mean, unfortunately they are in an area of the -- of the world where, you know, I mean, things can happen elsewhere, but where things are not the most pleasant for everybody -- whether they don\u2122t somehow look upon me as be ing somebody who might be in a position to help, were something to go wrong."

I don\u2122t recall my mo ther ever saying to me, or in her presence, because they were always -- and I was always taken along at these things, because they had nowhere to leave me, my mother, and didn\u2122t want to leave me anyway. And -- and so she would be talking in German, and when she mentioned th e St. Louis, I don\u2122t ever recall her saying that she had, on the St. Louis, an unpleasant experience, any of the crew, or the staff, or anybody was rude to her. Now usually, if somebody was rude, or crude, or showed impatience or something, I\u2122m sure she would have made a comment about that. My mo -- my mother was rather memeticulous a-about that sort of thing. I never heard her say anything which was like a derogatory scenario. Obviously, of course, it was from the -- from the point of view of where we were going to land, was serious. But I don\u2122t recall her ever mentioning that -- that the people as -- the staff of the -- of the crew, either on the way out, or on the way back to Europe, were unpleasant, as far as she was -- a -- as something which she could ha ve said had impacted upon her. Now, whether that happened with -- you know, in the same wa y to -- to 999 other passengers, I don\u2122t know, and I can\u2122t say, you know. But in that context, that\u2122s perhaps another way of trying to explain to you that, you know, the -- for me -- for -- I think for my parents it was always the question of where 97 would they end up. Because don\u2122t forget, my father probably -- I mean this is not a -- we don\u2122t have a piece of paper saying that, but I\u2122m pretty sure that for my father, he was under notice, as must -- must have been my grandfather, if you are not out of Germany within some things, we will be back for you and Buchenwald will be even worse than it already is. Now, on the other hand, I have the Red Cross letters, of which my grandmother on my father\u2122s side was still alive and writing to us in April of 1942. We received it in June \u212242, okay. Now, in the same year, in September, she was transported to Theresienstadt , and died a month late r, we just got that confirmed yesterday, okay, here. I just had that -- your -- your -- your -- your colleague downstairs, Steve oh, whatever it is, found it out. And it\u2122s taken me a long time, you know. How many -- over half a century to find that out. So how did these things happen, it\u2122s -- it\u2122s conceivable that the people would have remained where they were for awhile, before all these really horrendous things, in terms of transportation, death cam ps, came along. In other words was building up, but it didn\u2122t happen in -- in one month. I\u2122m not trying to minimize that, okay. So it\u2122s possible that my parents c ould have lived in Halle from somewhat longer. But I think that my father was under sentence, if you follow what I\u2122m getting at."
