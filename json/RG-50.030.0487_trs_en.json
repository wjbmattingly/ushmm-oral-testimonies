            "question": "John Meyerstein, conducted by Nina Ellis on July first, 2004, in Washington, D.C. This is tape number one, side A. Just for the record, would you tell me your name, where you live now, and when and where you were born.",
            "answer": "Okay. My name is John Meyerstein. I was originally called Hans Meyerstein, but when we arrived in England after the St. Louis voyage, it was suggested to my parents that -- that they give me an English first name, and the name John was chosen, I\u2019m not sure how, and it\u2019s -- from that moment onwards it became that, and my parents never used any other name but that, at the time. I currently live in Oakville, Ontario, which is about 20 miles west of Toronto. I was born in Halle, Germany, on the 21*' of March, 1935."

            "question": "Mm-hm. Tell me, do you have many memories of those first years in Germany?",
            "answer": "Truthfully I have to say no. I know that some people say that they can remember everything when they were in a pram, or a cradle. I have to be truthful and say I do not recall those sort of things."

            "question": "Okay. Tell me about your parents, their names, and where they were from.",
            "answer": "My father was Ludwig Meyerstein. He was born in Rosslau, Germany in -- on March the 10\", 1893. My mother was Alice Meyerstein, born Alice Eisner, and she was born in a -- a place called Gutentag, in Upper Silesia, Germany, on the 29\" of June, 1910."

            "answer": "How they met I don\u2019t know, I rather suspect it was one of these arranged marriages. Both my families -- both my parent\u2019s families were financially very well off, and I can only conclude that it was assumed that this would be a good way of having a marriage. My mother never discussed it, in fact she probably talked to my wife years later on things which she didn\u2019t discuss with me. But how they actually met, and -- I don\u2019t know, I rather think it was a -- an arranged marriage, but how that was done, if -- if my assessment 1s correct, I have no idea."

            "answer": "Yes, he was -- he served in -- four years in -- in World War I, together with an older brother, who also served fo -- four years, and a younger brother, who was also in -- in World War I, but who did not come back, he was killed in -- in 1918, I think, a week or two before Armistice Day, and was listed as missing 1n action, and never -- never found again, actually. So there were three brothers, of which my father was one, went to the wars, in 1914 - \u201918, and only two came back."

            "answer": "My -- I -- I -- I think my father\u2019s younger brother was in an infantry regiment. My father and his elder brother, Hugo -- and I should say that my father\u2019s younger brother, the one who was killed in 1914 - \u201918, was called Hans, and that was why I was originally called Hans, because my grandmother wanted to have a -- a grandson following that name. My father and his elder brother Hugo both served in cal -- cavalry regiments to begin with, and Is -- I don\u2019t know how far the cavalry went, because as you know, things changed, and cavalry re -- regiments then became extinct almost, and presumably went into infantry regiments. My father\u2019s elder brother Hugo came out at the end of the war as a captain, and my father ended the war, I think, as a second leftenant."

            "num": 9,
            "question": "-- did he see combat?",
            "answer": "I -- I -- I think they both did, I do not know where they served. I believe it was always on the western front, because I think that my father would have mentioned something if -- if -- if it had been elsewhere on the eastern front at that time. I have my father\u2019s military b-book, you know, of the class of -- of 19 f -- I can\u2019t think what they call it now, class of 1914, or -- or something like that. But it doesn\u2019t show exactly where all these things were, it wa -- just like a military record book, which I had years later in the British army, when I was drafted. But I\u2019ve also since, in the last -- since my father\u2019s death, found my grandfather\u2019s military book, and he was in the class of 1879, in the militia, in an artillery regiment. So, on my father\u2019s side of the family, military activity was not a -- an unusual activity, despite what the -- the Germans said, that there were that few -- not that many Jews volunteered or fought, that was totally incorrect. I do recall that my father mentioned to me that he provi -- that his father, my grandfather, provided the horses, and gave them money and so forth, because in the units which they had to serve, particularly since they ultimately ended up in -- with -- in the commission rank, that required more funding, and my parents were obviously in -- in a position to -- to -- to -- to -- to -- to provide that. The other thing which I found rather interesting, contrary to what I sometimes read, is that my father, on one or two occasions, and these were things which we could always discuss, said to me that when he entered the -- the cavalry regiment, or was in -- was -- w-was organized to go to this unit, that the -- the colonel of the regiment said to him, \u201cWell, Meyerstein, you can\u2019t say that there are any anti -- anti-Jews here, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d So again, I find it sometimes a bit awkwa -- difficult to understand when I read various documents, as to what took - actually took place. Obviously there were anti-Jewish Germans, and there were Germans who didn\u2019t view this in any shape or form. Whether that\u2019s normal, I can\u2019t say actually, you know."

            "num": 10,
            "question": "Right, right.",
            "answer": "And they -- and my brother -- and one other thing which I think you might find interesting -- and this was apparently -- this wa -- given to me by my mother, who had a very good relationship in terms of -- of f-friendship with my father\u2019s brother, 1s after World War I, when the German army was reorganized -- this was told by my Uncle Hugo to my mother, they got in touch with my Uncle Hugo, who obviously had a very good military record, and said, \u201c\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come back into the German army?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, you know, I\u2019m Jewish.\u201d And - and apparently they said to him, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you just say you\u2019re Christian, it won\u2019t any difference,\u201d and -- and left it. He didn\u2019t, of course, do that. What I\u2019m getting at it\u2019s so peculiar and so strange in what subsequently took place."

            "answer": "My father\u2019s family had a -- what you would call a small department store in Rosslau. They were the only Jewish family in this entire community. In fact my grandmother, my f-father\u2019s mother, was also born in this -- in Rosslau, and I have the documents, the birth certificate, and the marriage certificate to my grandfather, also 1-in -- in my files. And apparently he was quite successful in that respect, and -- and was continued, I think, until the German -- until the Nazis came to power, and of course ultimately that was all taken away from them."

        {
            "num": 14,
            "question": "Were they just full assimilated [indecipherable]",
            "answer": "Absolute -- I -- I -- I would have to say yes, because I have -- if you look at the birth certificates, and the marriage certificates of both sides of my grandparents, you will find that the names are all traditional German names. M-My father is Ludwig. My elder -- his elder brother Hugo, my -- hi-his younger brother Hans, the one who was killed, and who I was named af -- Hans. My grandmother was named Rosian, which literally trans -- mean little rose. My -- my grandfather was Max. If you look at his parent\u2019s birth certificates, 1t\u2019s Magnus, which 1s really like a Latin name, and the grandmother, I think was -- great-grand -- was Regina. But this also applies to my father\u2019s -- grandmother -- my mother\u2019s grandparents in like manner. So when people say to me, well what Jewish names did they have, I have to be honest and say I don\u2019t honestly know. My mother, for example is Alice, spelled the same way in English as it 1s 1n -- in- in German, except in German it\u2019s a different pronunciation. So the documents which I have finally found among my father\u2019s papers, after a long time, so far I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve sor -- deciphered that they\u2019ve gone back to about 1822, and they\u2019re all -- the Christian names, the first names, were all literally almost -- you could say either they were English or they were German, but totally integrated. And I suspect that that -- the shock of what subsequent happened, they probably couldn\u2019t believe what was taking place."

            "num": 16,
            "question": "And your father worked there?",
            "answer": "No, my father -- my father became a barrister and a judge, moved to Halle, where I was ultimately born, practiced criminal law. And ironically -- Halle is a very big chemical loca -- area, even I think to this day. And 1-ironically, which I didn\u2019t realize, he never discussed it, but my mother mentioned it to me, and also my cousin who lives in Australia, whose mother is my father\u2019s -- was my father\u2019s sister, told me that he was also the outside counsel for I.G. Farben, the big German chemical company, which ultimately made the -- the material which was doing the gas chambers. Course, this all -- we\u2019re not talking about that particular period, we\u2019re talking in the -- in the 30\u2019s and so forth. So my father had a very successful, an-and according to my mother was a very well known criminal barrister 1-in Halle."

            "answer": "My -- my mother\u2019s parents lived, as I mentioned, in -- in Gutentag, which is an interesting name because it means good day, or good morning -- in Upper Silesia, almost on the -- on the Polish border. My -- she had one brother called Lota, and her father was Ludwig Eisner, and my grandmother, my mother\u2019s mother, was Rosa Eisner. They owned what you would call a farm equipment wholesale business. And I have pictures, I found pictures. I have no idea how they managed to keep these particular pictures, or bring them with them considering all the other problems which they were experiencing. Where my grandfather had -- you could see the trucks outside his -- th-the fi -- th-the family business and home, with the telephone number, and on the truck, branded names of things like percil and so forth, even American products. They did farm equipment, I would sort of say, you know, which supplied the farming community, which was predominantly Polish speaking, although this Upper S-Silesia was of course Germany, and had been for 150 years or so. And very successful as well."

            "question": "So let\u2019s start now with -- with -- your father was arrested, I understand, in -- in 1938?",
            "answer": "Well, actually, he was initial -- he was arrested twice. The first ti -- my fa -- my father\u2019s sister emigrated with her husband to Australia as a result of friends which they had who -- who helped them there. And one of the -- also from Germany, also German Jews. And one of the German Jews had some business things which were required to -- to be handled, and I believe, and this 1s only -- I\u2019m only surmising this, cause we never di -- I only heard this from my mother, my father took over some activities. This was, or been public perhaps early \u201938 or so. And for some reason or another, you know, at that time, the -- the German government was already starting to try and take money, or -- and various other things from -- from German -- from German Jews, and their businesses. And he was arrested and held for six weeks in Halle -- but it was obviously nowhere near anything which subsequently took place -- and was released. And then, I think after Kristall night, which was in the latter part of 1938, my father was arrested and taken to Buchenwald. My mother\u2019s father was also arrested and taken to Buchenwald. My father\u2019s -- my mother\u2019s brother, Lota, was also arrested and taken to Buchenwald. And they found each other there, of all -- I mean, most incredible, found each other. All three got out. Now, you have to remember, my father was a first World War veteran, my grandfather, my mother\u2019s mother -- father was also a veteran. And I have subsequently read books and documents which indicate that the Germans basically said to some of these people, \u201cBecause of your activities as, you know, in World War I, we're going to let you go. But you have so many days or weeks, and if you are still here in Germany, then we -- if when we re-arrest you again, we\u2019ll never -- you\u2019 Il never get out.\u201d So I believe my father must have got out, probably in early 1939. I don\u2019t know which day, and my grandfather. My Uncle Lota also got out, but I don\u2019t know exactly when, and under what conditions, but they did, and I have proof of the fact, perma -- documentation that my father then applied for visa to the United States in, I think, February of 1939. So between Kristallnacht and entry into Buchenwald, and now it must have been somewhere between that time, and shall we say the end of January, or -- so he was rather lucky to get out at that time."

            "answer": "Well, I -- yes, I -- I think you\u2019re right, but I think the motivating factor might have come more from my aunt\u2019s husband, as distinct from other things. My mother has mention -- mentioned to me on several occasions as a boy when I asked questions, that I think sometime in \u201938 -- when, I don\u2019t know, I think before Kristallnacht, okay, that the families got together. My father\u2019s family, of which really, was really in my grandmother, because my -- my grandfather on my father\u2019s side, died in 1929, so th -- you know, none of this would have applied, got together, and sort of said what we could -- what -- what should we do, because at that time you still, from what I\u2019ve been given to understand from my mother, you could still take out all your money and belongings without any problems. But they couldn\u2019t come to any conclusion. And you have to remember, from my father\u2019s side of the family, it was -- I have the documents to the early 1800\u2019s and my father always used to say to me it was even before, you know whe -- they were more German than the Germans."

Now, I don\u2019t th -- I don\u2019t think that that was quite as di -- as long on my mother\u2019s side of the family, because I understand that from their aspects, my mother\u2019s grandfather, m-my gra -- my great-grandfather came from Poland in the days when Poland was under Russian law, and rode across the border into Germany, into -- into Silesia. Because in those days the Russians used to call people up for military service, and it wasn\u2019t just a two year stint, it was 20 years before they were released. So I suspect that they -- his parents, great-great-grandparents, sort of said you\u2019d better get out and -- and -- and go somewhere else. But, if you follow what I\u2019m getting at, it\u2019s that depth of -- of period. But my parent, when they had the meeting with -- with the two families, obviously couldn\u2019t come to lo -- to a conclusion. We\u2019re sitting here today saying why not?

Everything which I read, where everything is stated, regulations do this, yes it\u2019s true, but things still somehow, how did they manage to survive and live with no income coming in?

Of the entrance or whatever it was. Nobody bothered her, but nobody was very -- nobody was terribly polite, but nobody was terribly rude, they just said go sit over there, and -- and -- and that was it.

And even though he\u2019d been four years in the first World War, I have to conclude that there was -- the -- what -- what he saw and experienced in Buchenwald had no comparison to what we read about, what took place in World War I, where it was strictly military and -- and not the other scenarios, but he was on th -- we never discussed that, he -- he -- he could not -- he could not --"

            "answer": "Okay. I don\u2019t know a great deal of how it was done. I can only conclude from my mother\u2019s comments, that the moment my father was released from Buchenwald, and them -- and 1-in -- in similar manner, I suspect, although probably not on the same day, my grandm -- my mother\u2019s fath -- my grandfather on my mother\u2019s side. They didn\u2019t really have much choice about leaving, because that which I\u2019ve read in more recent times would indicate that they were probably told you have a minimum period of time, and if we find you again, you have to go. We\u2019re -- we\u2019re -- we'll arrest you and -- and you\u2019ll never be let out again. How they got tickets on the St. Louis, who organized that, and in what manner, I don\u2019t know. I do know that my parents -- and this is only what my mother told me, that they already knew that they would have to leave, even though my father and my grandfather were in Buchenwald, something would have to be done, or immediately after Buchenwald. And my grandmother -- my -- on my mother\u2019s side, came down from Gutentag, presumably to Halle, and they went -- they bought things, including jewelry, which they sewed -- from what I\u2019m told, stitched into furnitu -- into the furniture, cause in those days, and this is where the anomaly is so incredible is, you could take everything that you had, or you could buy it. So they took two complete containers, which I would be -- the equivalent of say -- I don\u2019t know what a container in those days would be viewed. Today, two con -- small containers would be 20 foot containers, which I gather was furniture, stove, fridge, whatever. In fact, \u2019ve often wondered about it, and said to my mother, why on earth would you take electrical appliances, that don\u2019t apply when we ended up in -- in -- in England, and -- and so forth. Clo -- everything which they had. And these all came on board the -- the St. Louis with us. We never got them at the end, but I mean, that -- that\u2019s a different story, and we can get to that in due course. How they did that, I don\u2019t know. I think the jewelry, and it was viewed as being a dangerous thing, but they didn\u2019t think that people would -- the -- the Germans would be tearing open the -- the -- the -- the furniture and so forth. They might check your clothing, but they wouldn\u2019t do anything else. And that was -- they hope would, if they got to wherever they were going, they could then sell those things and which -- provide some money. Because as you know, when we left on the St. Louis, I think -- I don\u2019t know what the amount was, probably, you know, five or six U.S. dollars at that time -- or I don\u2019t know, not much more. So in other words, you had money when you -- before you left the ga -- the dockside, you climbed on the St. Louis, and you had nothing left at the time, so we -- we had no money on -- on that. Everything had already been paid for on the St. Louis. But how that actually happened, I really don\u2019t know. At th -- it was never explained to me, and I -- I\u2019ve asked my -- I have some cousins in Australia from my mother\u2019s side, and they don\u2019t know. They know even less than I do."

I don\u2019t think so. He wouldn\u2019t be standing around. He -- he was not the -- he was not an outward going person. My mother was, he was more reserved.

            "answer": "My mother told me -- well, apparently up to the -- up to the arrival in Cuba, it was -- 1t was very -- seemed to be very pleasant, in fact unbelievably, I mean, not that she said that, but when you read the background, you have to really question yourself. Here they are forced out of a country, and suddenly being, you know, provided with -- with -- with a staff, you know, waiters and everything else, at beck and call, considering what was taking place. But I think a great deal, from what I\u2019ve read, or what I\u2019ve heard, would indicate that the captain of the St. Louis was an extremely decent individual, and determined to -- he was determined to -- to have this as if there was no -- no animosity against anybody in particular. And I believe the -- the Israeli government honored him with a -- with a -- with a medal after the war, and I\u2019ve also read that as a result of his activities, he was relieved of command when the St. Louis ultimately returned empty in -- in - to Germany. Never given another command, although he was a career naval officer from World War I days. But he was left alone, which 1s always again, you do -- you\u2019d have thought he\u2019d have been put on trial for being decent to Jews. That did not happen. So I think a lot the -- the -- the way the -- the -- the staff and the crew of the St. Louis conducted themselves, probably in my -- I can only surmise, was the way the captain felt they should handle themselves. So I think the voyage to Cuba probably was very pleasant. The voyage back from Cuba was not so pleasant. My -- my mother told me that things started to go downhill emotionally for people. And I -- I don\u2019t know the name, I can\u2019t recall the name of it, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s listed somewhere, there was one person who threw himself overboard in -- off the St. Louis in -- in -- in the harbor. I think, you know, t-trying to commit suicide, you know. And my mother knew the wi -- or had met the wife of -- of that ba -- if -- 1f -- if my memory is correct. Ya -- people talked among themselves sometimes, but to what degree I don\u2019t know. On the voyage back, they apparently had to have committees, which were -- the captain requested the men to form, if they were willing, various committees which would -- which would sort of patrol the decks, certainly during the night, or during the day and night, to avoid people from trying to commit suicide, and my father -- my mother told me that my father was -- was a member of one of these committees. I don\u2019t know what my grandfather, whether he was that way. It\u2019s just that she responded, or she mentioned that to me, because there was serious -- a -- a serious thought by various people that others would perhaps do this. Whether that\u2019s right or wrong I don\u2019t know, actually. I\u2019m not aware that anybody did do it, but there was that particular feeling. And of course there must have been, and I suspect, although my mother didn\u2019t mention it, a tremendous apprehension as to what was going to happen, because if the ship really returned to Hamburg again, then -- or wherever we sailed, the re -- the results would have been extremely dire."

My mother said to me that she perhaps, without ra -- you know, thinking and -- about it, said that she might have been tempted, if it had been her choice, to try to go to France, because as a young teenager, her father had sent her with her brother to do a tour of Europe in the summertime.

I mean here I\u2019m still at school. I remember we were walking down -- this is quite clear to me -- walking down Oxford Street, which is like Fifth Avenue in New York. It\u2019s a bustling community, you know? It wasn\u2019t exactly empty of people, even in war time. And suddenly we saw, what my mother explained to me, an extremely Orthodox, pious Jew, with a beard and a hat, and I mean, the complete regalia. And my mother stopped to look around, and I had to stop and she said, \u201cLook at that.\u201d And the only people stopping to look were my mother and myself, and I said, \u201cWell, what is it?\u201d And she said, \u201cBut, that\u2019s an Orthodox Jew.\u201d And I didn\u2019t quite know what she meant at that time. Well I think afterwards, years later my -- I -- we talked about this, my mother and I, is that it was so incredible, nobody paid the slightest attention. It was not an unnatural event. They -- people just all were passing back -- my mother thought it was so unnatural in the -- in the context of what she\u2019d left, to see this. For me, I didn\u2019t really think about this until years later, when I began to understand what she really meant. But I remember her saying to me, \u201cThat\u2019s a very Orthodox Jew.\u201d But I think she, a-as I say, she was wondering whether people would accost him, or -- or affront him, or something.

My military experiences certainly helped in that, because in those days when you went for a job interview, more or less any company would ask, have you been in the military? In England, what sort of school did you go to, and have you served in the military and the third question was, have you served overseas? And I think the reason for that was that they felt if -- if those three things all tied together, they had a reliable, disciplined person, who would understand what to do, okay.

I don\u2019t know. It was never discussed.

            "answer": "I can recall that on odd occasions -- certainly not by my father because he never discussed those things, but my mother, when we talked about the St. Louis, or she mentioned it to other -- generally German refugees earlier in the war, when they got together in -- in Bedford, you know, three or four people, or something, they would -- or they would talk to each other and -- and the St. Louis might well come up. I don\u2019t recall my mother ever saying to me, or in her presence, because they were always -- and I was always taken along at these things, because they had nowhere to leave me, my mother, and didn\u2019t want to leave me anyway. And -- and so she would be talking in German, and when she mentioned the St. Louis, I don\u2019t ever recall her saying that she had, on the St. Louis, an unpleasant experience, any of the crew, or the staff, or anybody was rude to her. Now usually, if somebody was rude, or crude, or showed impatience or something, I\u2019m sure she would have made a comment about that. My mo -- my mother was rather me- meticulous a-about that sort of thing. I never heard her say anything which was like a derogatory scenario. Obviously, of course, it was from the -- from the point of view of where we were going to land, was serious. But I don\u2019t recall her ever mentioning that -- that the people as -- the staff of the -- of the crew, either on the way out, or on the way back to Europe, were unpleasant, as far as she was -- a -- as something which she could have said had impacted upon her. Now, whether that happened with -- you know, in the same way to -- to 999 other passengers, I don\u2019t know, and I can\u2019t say, you know. But in that context, that\u2019s perhaps another way of trying to explain to you that, you know, the -- for me -- for -- I think for my parents it was always the question of where would they end up. Because don\u2019t forget, my father probably -- I mean this is not a -- we don\u2019t have a piece of paper saying that, but I\u2019m pretty sure that for my father, he was under notice, as must -- must have been my grandfather, if you are not out of Germany within some things, we will be back for you and Buchenwald will be even worse than it already 1s. Now, on the other hand, I have the Red Cross letters, of which my grandmother on my father\u2019s side was still alive and writing to us in April of 1942. We received it in June *42, okay. Now, in the same year, in September, she was transported to Theresienstadt, and died a month later, we just got that confirmed yesterday, okay, here. I just had that -- your -- your -- your -- your colleague downstairs, Steve oh, whatever it is, found it out. And it\u2019s taken me a long time, you know. How many -- over half a century to find that out. So how did these things happen, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s conceivable that the people would have remained where they were for awhile, before all these really horrendous things, in terms of transportation, death camps, came along. In other words was building up, but it didn\u2019t happen in -- in one month. I\u2019m not trying to minimize that, okay. So it\u2019s possible that my parents could have lived in Halle from somewhat longer. But I think that my father was under sentence, if you follow what I\u2019m getting at."
