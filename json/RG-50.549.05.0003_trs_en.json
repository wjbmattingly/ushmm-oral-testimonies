A lot of\u2013 there was no room to go to the bathroom, you should excuse me, a lot of people made on themselves. It was just like, cattle have a better, better look than we had. It was just unbearable. And my brother, the oldest brother jumped the tr ain. He didn\u2122t want to come into Auschwitz and they were standing there and shooting. So, I never heard from him, so I don\u2122t know if he got shot or he got killed afterwards. My father to the last minute still had good ideas, that they\u2122re not going to hurt us, they\u2122re going to put us to work. But it was not so. The minute we arrived to Auschwitz, we still saw people standing and digging ditches. And he said, \ufb01What did I tell you children? They\u2122re more civilized than anythi ng else. They\u2122re not going to do these things. They\u2122re not going to kill.\ufb02 And as soon as the train stopped it became like a terrible wind.

Didn\u2122t see my sister, she was next to me, but she wouldn\u2122t part with her children, so you pulled her out on this side. So, I ran out from my side and I went to see\u2013 to be with my sister. And the SS, they had canes. They took the cane and put around my neck and pulled me out. They pulled me back to that line. So, I ran again over to my sister. I think I was s cared, I didn\u2122t know which way. I wanted to be with her. So he took me out for the second time and he opened up my head. Hit me with the cane over the head and that was th e end of it. I never saw them afterwards. So, when you come into Auschwitz, you had to get undr essed and of course, I started to cry very much. I wanted to go to my si ster. I didn\u2122t tell them what , what I was crying. And an SS woman comes over to me and she says to me, \ufb01Why are you crying?\ufb02 Disoriented. Everything\u2013 it was unbelievable what they could put people in. And she says to me, \ufb01Why are you crying?\ufb02 So I said to her, \ufb01I want to go back to my sister.\ufb02 And she said, \ufb01You are going to see her tomorrow.\ufb02 She was a good one. And th en another SS woman came over, said, \ufb01Why are you crying?\ufb02 I cried harder. I said, \ufb01Because I want to go to your sister\u2013 to my sister.\ufb02 She said, \ufb01You\u2122ll never see her again.\ufb02 And since that point, I never cried again. Because first they, they cut your hair, and then they tattooed, and my hand got swo llen like this. And lonesome, you have nobody. I was really transport from the same town, but they were no, not related to me. And I had nobody. And the following day when they took us to work, we saw the smoke coming out of the chimney and I put two and two toge ther and I knew exactly what was going on, that they not around anymore.

You had to listen, and you had to be strong, and you had to help one another the best you were able to. And that\u2122s exactly what happened. I was always helping and one day, one morning\u2013 it was called the block, the pla ce where you were staying. And every day somebody else had to go to get coffee in the mo rning. And\u2013 two people, because it looked like USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003 13 13a garbage barrel. With two _______________ and you had to carry. And that morning was my, my turn to go to get the coffee in the morni ng. Had to go to the kitchen. And sure enough I went and the other girl went and from nowhere a girl came along and she had a, a plate like a\u2013 you know, like a\u2013 I don\u2122t know what, how to\u2013 like she used to get the soup there. You know? They used to carry with you all the time. And sh e stopped the, the pot to get some coffee. And an SS woman saw her through the window. She came running out with the dog, and she poured the hot coffee, boiling coffee on my leg. And the skin came off right away. And\u2013 and that\u2122s it, and there was nobody to talk to. Nobody to, nobody to complain. Because nobody would listen to you. They would gas you. So, after being three weeks like that, and without medication. I used to put on, they had like a little blanket to cover yourself, whatever it was. And I used to, I ripped up a piece and I made like a, like a bandage. And it used to get stuck during the night and in the morning I used to take it off and I went to work like that. A nd couldn\u2122t go on no more. And I said, after three weeks, \ufb01I can\u2122t go on no more to work. I cannot carry on.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Whatever\u2122s going happen, it\u2122s going to happen. I\u2122ll remain on the block.\ufb02 And you were not allowed to go to\u2013 to remain on the, on the bl ock, because they would kill you. They would gas you the same day. So, I went to work and we we re digging ditches and they moved away from there and I threw myself into the ditches and I figure d I\u2122ll let me lay there. It\u2122s like a grave. Let me remain there. But somehow they walked away and I crept out and I went on Revier. The Revier meant, like a hospital. And they wouldn\u2122 t accept no Jews, of course. So, I went in there and they accepted me. They asked me who did it. I said, \ufb01I burned myself.\ufb02 I was not allowed to say that the SS woman did it to me. I says, \ufb01I burned myself,\ufb02 and that\u2122s it. And they accepted me. You didn\u2122t get no help or medication or a nything like that, but at least you had the rest. You didn\u2122t have to get up six o\u2122clock in the morning and stand outside for Zahl Appell. They used to count everyone in the morning. And this took an hour if it rained or snowed, whatever, they didn\u2122t care, because they were dressed. And so, I said to myself, at least I don\u2122t have to go through this. And that\u2122s the way I remained fo r two, three weeks, and then they had a big selection. And, and I don\u2122t know if you ever sa w it, it\u2122s\u2013 the beds were like boards, you know what I\u2122m saying? Straight boards. And you we re\u2013 it was down and up. It was two, two layers, the boards. And I was upstairs. And they said everybody should go down because they had like a selection."

And that was my first greeting with the Kapos. And from then on, like I said, there was nobody that told you, but you figured out already what\u2122s going on and, and that\u2122s it.

And then I got a better job. So the woman that took care on me, she was a Polish woman\u0160not took care, but she spoke to me, let\u2122s put it this way\u0160on the Revier, was a very nice person. So one day I approached her after being there maybe three or four months. So I, I asked he r if\u2013 she used to come in the morning, she was wearing a white coat.

I can\u2122t give her nothing that I have of me. What could I do? I said, okay, I\u2122m going to help her to clean out. She was clean ing out under the beds, the walk. And I said, I have to help her. Before she gets here, I\u2122m goi ng to do it and when she comes she won\u2122t have so much work. So, I told her. But when I went down, I could, I fainted from laying so long on the bed. That I couldn\u2122t, I couldn\u2122t do. So I got up, and somebody helped me to go back on the bed. When she came in that day, I told her what ha ppened. She says, \ufb01If you want to live, you must get off that bed.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Sure I want to live.\ufb02 So, she said, \ufb01But let\u2122s do it\u2013\ufb02 excuse me. \ufb01You start doing it before the SS comes in, before th ey change.\ufb02 So, I don\u2122t know what time it was, four or five o\u2122clock, I don\u2122t know. So I climbed down again from the bed and I was able to stand for a minute. So this was really a big accomplishm ent. And I took a chair and I pushed it. And I was walking, like jumping, I couldn\u2122t put down ye t the foot all the way on the bottom, on the floor like. But every day I tried, until I got stronger.

I have to get off and they were, they were trying out\u2013 there was a period of time that they didn\u2122t gas. They got a lot of money. I think it was from Turkey or I can\u2122t remember ex actly from where it was. And this was to, to hold off the, the selections. And she said they were trying, they were looking for, for nurses. That pretty soon they were going to ask who wants to become a nurse. So, she said to me, \ufb01I would advise you to volunteer for that.\ufb02 So, that\u2122s exactly what I did. I volunteered and I was transferred from this into a diffe rent, a better place, not too far from one another.

First of all, th ey were evacuating us from Auschwitz, because the Russians came close and they did not\u2013 the Germans did not want to fall into the Russian hands. So, they evacuated us to Ravensbr\u00fcck. Ravensbr\u00fcck was another camp, but it was not as bad as Auschwitz. They didn\u2122t have the gassing chambers. It was just a concentration camp and there I got a job in the kitchen. And I was dishing out food and everybody came over, \ufb01Jospele, Jospele, give me some food.\ufb02 Just pour it in. You know, because I, it was not mine to begin with, and they were hungry. So I always did that. In that respect I was lucky, I always got good jobs. And then from Ravensbr\u00fcck they transferred us to Sw itau. That\u2122s where we were liberated. And there, I was already there with nine, nine girls. All of us were Jewish girls. And somehow, like I said before, this was not a concentration camp. They couldn\u2122t gas you there. It was just working, a camp, a concentration, but without th e, without the, what do you call that? The gas chambers. So, now we were there nine girls an d there were a lot of Polish women that were from Auschwitz. And they exactly knew that we are Jews. So, one day we spoke among ourselves and we decided that we\u2122re not going to go in, all of us, together to wash in the morning, because we didn\u2122t want to be with anybody that should identify us. So, we ran in and we washed ourselves, like three of them and thr ee stood outside. And that\u2122s the way we made it up. Sure enough, one day all of the Polish, and they were even anti-Semites. They were very mean. It\u2122s not that we took anything away, but th ey had to squeal, they had to tell that we are not, that we are not gentiles, we are Jews. And sure enough, one day they found out. And they went and they squealed. And they called us all out. These, these, these, you know, the numbers they called and we had to go in the front. A nd they said to us, \ufb01Are you Jewish? Are you Jews?\ufb02 We said, \ufb01No.\ufb02 We made it up before, becau se we felt that it\u2122s the end. That was what it was trying to come. We heard the, you know, that\u2122s a battlefield going on. We heard the shooting. We heard the cannonen (ph) , they used to call it, the\u2013 everything, but we didn\u2122t know exactly when it\u2122s going to be the end. We knew it\u2122s nearby. So, that\u2122s the way we made up, that we\u2013 each one was going to say, \ufb01My mother was Je wish, my father was a gentile.\ufb02 The other one said, \ufb01My father was gentile, my mother wa s Jewish.\ufb02 You know, all of us denying. And they looked, and they looked, and they looked and thank God, they didn\u2122t kill us. But\u2013 and then from there we went to Sw itau. This was the last camp."

The people from Bia ystok, interviewed them. And they said\u2013 and that\u2122s when I got hit, when they wanted a doll for the Block elteste (ph) , for the Kapo. And that\u2122s when I tried to organize and give it to her. And that\u2122s what happened. And that\u2122s when they said, in that transport my mo ther was, but I did not see her. I did not see anybody, no. That was last time. When I met them at, when we arrived in Auschwitz, I never saw them again. Always hoping, always search ing, always looking, but of course, nothing. When I was in Paris, we lived in Paris for a y ear, after the war, of course. And I was always going on the trains, looking. In Europe the trains are much better than\u2013 you never saw a train, did you? Oh, in Washington they have beauti ful trains. Here, because it was riding in Washington on the train. But by us in New York, the trains were horrible. And I always used to run from train to train. That\u2122s what I did in Paris, looking, the searching. From the back, look like my sister, from the back look like my brothe r. Always thinking, looking into their eyes, but of course, it was not them. But I always thought, yes, yes, I\u2122m going to find somebody. But that\u2122s it."

            "answer": "That\u2122s what kept me going. My friend told me that, too. Halina, the one from England. There was a time in my life when I was in Paris, I\u2122m going way ahead. This was after the war and we were liberated. And the Americans liberated us. And each of us from the nine girls that there were, had family in the United States. I had an uncle. This one had a sister and this one had in South America. Every one of us had family a nd they advised us that we shouldn\u2122t go back to Poland. They asked us, what do we want to do. And we said, we want to go to Poland to look for the family. And they advised us not to go back to Poland, because at that point already everything was shared up already, what belongs to whom. Poland belonged to Russia already. And they told us not to go, because we\u2122ll never ge t out of there. So, the only thing they advised, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003 24 24advised us, excuse me, is we should go back to Pa ris. Excuse me. So, the Americans, the ones that liberated, advised us not to go back to Paris, uh, not to go back to Poland. We should go to Paris, from there the organizations will take over and we\u2122ll find our family and then we\u2122ll be able to get to them. So that\u2122s exactly what happened. They gave us a paper and they put us on, because we had no clothes. So, they gave us a pa per, and they gave us uniforms that the WACs wore and they put us on the train. And we were going to Paris from Switau, from the Czechs, we were going to Paris. And on the way they took us off the train one stop and they said that we shouldn\u2122t talk to them, we should just give them the paper. And sure enough on the, the next stop they put us back on and we came to Paris. And there Rothschild gave us, it was a hotel. And they gave us the hotel for the misplaced people . And that\u2122s what it was. We slept two in a room and downstairs was a kitchen. So, and we used to be able to come down and eat. Now, I don\u2122t remember how long I was there, but I just couldn\u2122t go down with a dish again and eat. So, I cried so much. But it was more tears in the di sh than it was food. And I decide I\u2122m going to cook for myself. And each floor, they had like a two burner. So, that\u2122s what happened. I bought some potatoes and that\u2122s what I used to cook. But of course, there was like a line. You know, you had to wait quite a while, but it was for me better not to go dow nstairs, but to cook and eat for myself. And so, that\u2122s where I got in with my friend. I slept with Halina, with my girlfriend. My cousin and another friend was in the other ro om. We were\u2013 we had nine rooms, one after the other. And at one point practically everybody found their family already and they were leaving. And of course, me, I didn\u2122t find my famil y, didn\u2122t find my uncle. And the only thing is, I said to myself and I said to them too, either he\u2122s very rich, he doesn\u2122t wa nt to identify himself, or he died, one of the two, so many years. So\u2013"

And there was nobody, nobody. And that day I was supposed to go to a funeral, also from, one from concentration camp. She lost her son of cancer, young fellow. And I was going to go to the funeral. And I had a ride. She didn\u2122t live too far from me, a few blocks. And when I came down on the block they told that they just left. They didn\u2122t wa it for me. I was very disappointed and hurt, and unbelievable, how could you not wait? I don\u2122t know if up to today, if they forgot or they just didn\u2122t care. I don\u2122t know. Because right afte r this it happened. And I never\u2013 I don\u2122t know them so well. But being she lives on the block, I was going to go with their neighbor, which they were also survivors of the Holocaust. But like I said, I didn\u2122t know them so close. So I really don\u2122t know if they did it deliberately or if they forgot, because I never was able to discuss it with them. So, when I came there on the block and it was very short for me, maybe two blocks. So the neighbor said to me, \ufb01Whom you looking for?\ufb02 So, I told her. She said, \ufb01They just left. Everybody left.\ufb02 So, I came home and I got und ressed. This was on a Friday, and started to prepare for dinner. And I opened up the window. And the, I had a, a, you know, what they call that? For the air to come thr ough. Like a shade or whatever it\u2122s called. And not thinking, not thinking, that God forbid somebody\u2122s going to cl imb in through that, open up the window and get in. And he hit me in the head, cut my face. I don\u2122t know, he broke my arms, they were hanging, both of them. He did something terrible . And my friend\u2013 me and his wife, she passed away, we were the best of friends from concentr ation camp. I\u2122m now friends with her daughters, always was. They live in New York\u2013 he knew that I was supposed to go to the funeral. He didn\u2122t go. And he kept calling. Called in the evening and no answer. So he couldn\u2122t figure it out what\u2122s going on. Then he thought maybe I we nt to, the woman that lost her son, to their daughter, to stay with them, help out. So, Sunday he came along to the house and I lived on the corner. And he walked around, parked the car and he walked around this way. \ufb01Justine, Justine, where are you?\ufb02 And I don\u2122t know from what and when. I yelled out, \ufb01Here I am. Save me, help me.\ufb02 And that\u2122s when he heard my voice. Across the street was sitting women, neighbors. So they, he asked the neighbors, \ufb01Did you see Justine?\ufb02 And she said \ufb01No, but I\u2122m wondering, the light is on. She never used to leave the light on. The light is on and I haven\u2122t seen her.\ufb02 So, when he heard that, he ran over to them and they climbed through the window, the kitchen window, because I had a porch, like a terrace like this, but higher. And they went in, one of them went in through the window and they found me laying on the floor in my bedroom in a puddle of blood. And that\u2122s when they called the police. And the police called an ambulance and that\u2122s why they put me into a hospital, a trau ma hospital. And they called my son and that\u2122s what happened."
