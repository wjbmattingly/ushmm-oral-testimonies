But this didn\u2019t... he couldn\u2019t carry this on, 2 because he had problems breathing, had a weak heart. So he couldn\u2019t continue to doing that part. So, that\u2019s when he had to quit his work and he stayed home with the children and helped out Mom at the store. He was a very lovable man, good, caring, very caring for the family. He was not born in Biatystok. He was born in Sokolka, which 1s not too far. My mother was born in Bialystok. And we were surrounded, always, by love and by friends and by family.

But the neighbors on the block, just enough to say a hello and good-bye and they had their life, and we had our life. I never had any problem. My father used to have problems, because he used to love soccer and every Saturday they had a soccer game. And after we finished our lunch, we used to go. But he always took along a cane, in case they hit him or they throw stones or whatever. If the game... if that team lost, you couldn\u2019t get home, because they used to be very mad. And that\u2019s what they used to do. They used to throw stones, hit you, so he always took a cane along with him. But he wouldn\u2019t miss a game. He loved it. He loved that sport.

And my father, may he rest in peace, always said, he was a medic in the First World War and he always says that the Germans wouldn\u2019t do that. They may put you to work, but they will never harm you in any way. And like anything else, you listen to your parents, whatever they told you. I mean, you didn\u2019t have much of a chance to run any place. We were on the... in our town, first came in the Russians. And we were with the Russians maybe a year. And we were on the... they evicted a lot of people that were in business for themselves. So, they put us on a truck to go, I don\u2019t know where, to Siberia or whatever."

And my mother gave them some money and they took us off the truck and we remained home. Had we known what was going on, that we wouldn\u2019t stay home, of course we would have gone to Russia better. But that\u2019s what it was. And then a year later, this was 1939, when the Germans came in. The Russians left and the Germans came in. And we were with them for a while from the beginning, then they started to make all kinds of things. When the men went to the Temple, like on a Saturday, they burned down the whole Temple with the people inside, whoever it was there. Then one Saturday they took away all the men. They left the women, but all the men. And that\u2019s when the trouble started. A while later, they put us into the ghetto and this was terrible. The ghetto was terrible."

She used to design for me clothes. She used to make me dresses. My second sister, she was 1n the house. My third one, she loved school, but she was sick. And I always used to complain to Mom, that she\u2019s... takes advantage of me. She hits me. Whatever she has, I cannot have it. Like we used to come from school on a Friday. She wanted something special. She wanted some kind of pastry and she always got it. And milk, she did not want it to eat, but it was in the house. I was forced to eat everything, whatever they cooked for me. And I rebelled. And I came to my Mom\u2019s store. This was after months. And I came to my Mom\u2019s store and I started to cry. And I said to her, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? You don\u2019t love me.\u201d I mean, what could a child think? I don\u2019t know how old was I, maybe seven or eight.

And when I would go to school with her, she has, she walks and I run, and I couldn\u2019t catch up with her. \u201cSo, how could you tell me that she is sick and I am well?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d my mother said, \u201cOh, I see you have already brains.\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d She says to me, \u201cHow many fingers do you have?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat are you talking about? Everybody has ten fingers.\u201d So, she said, \u201cIf you hurt one, if you cut one, does it hurt you?\u201d I said, \u201cOf course, what kind of talk is that?\u201d That\u2019s when she sat me down on her lap and she explained it tome. \u201cI love you all the same, but she happen to be sick, that\u2019s why she gets everything. I don\u2019t want to upset her.\u201d So, again, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. How could you do that to me?\u201d 4 So, she said, \u201cWatch.\u201d She had, what do you... now it\u2019s going to come back to me. I\u2019m getting all excited. Epilepsy."

But I... still I had to see it for myself, that kind of child was I. And sure enough when the light came up and I used to see everybody running to her bed and foam came out of her mouth. And from then on, you couldn\u2019t do nothing to her, she was the best sister. She couldn\u2019t be wrong in any place. I looked into her eyes. This all I have to thank my mom, that she explained it to me properly, because otherwise I would grow up hating her, how she dared do that to me.

You know what I\u2019m saying? We didn\u2019t jump to any conclusions ahead. That\u2019s the way we were raised. My oldest sister got married. And she had two children. The other sister got married in the ghetto. And my brothers, my brother got married in the ghetto. And they all had children in the ghetto. And that\u2019s what it... 1t was kind of hard on us.

A lot of... there was no room to go to the bathroom, you should excuse me, a lot of people made on themselves. It was just like, cattle have a better, better look than we had. It was just unbearable. And my brother, the oldest brother jumped the train. He didn\u2019t want to come into Auschwitz and they were standing there and shooting. So, I never heard from him, so I don\u2019t know if he got shot or he got killed afterwards. My father to the last minute still had good ideas, that they\u2019re not going to hurt us, they\u2019re going to put us to work. But it was not so. The minute we arrived to Auschwitz, we still saw people standing and digging ditches. And he said, \u201cWhat did I tell you children? They\u2019re more civilized than anything else. They\u2019re not going to do these things. They\u2019re not going to kill.\u201d And as soon as the train stopped it became like a terrible wind. And they separated us, the women this way and the men that way. Didn\u2019t see my father anymore. Didn\u2019t see my sister, she was next to me, but she wouldn\u2019t part with her children, so you pulled her out on this side. So, I ran out from my side and I went to see... to be with my sister. And the SS, they had canes. They took the cane and put around my neck and pulled me out. They pulled me back to that line. So, I ran again over to my sister. I think I was scared, I didn\u2019t know which way. I wanted to be with her. So he took me out for the second time and he opened up my head. Hit me with the cane over the head and that was the end of it. I never saw them afterwards. So, when you come into Auschwitz, you had to get undressed and of course, I started to cry very much. I wanted to go to my sister. I didn\u2019t tell them what, what I was crying. And an SS woman comes over to me and she says to me, \u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d Disoriented. Everything... it was unbelievable what they could put people in. And she says to me, \u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d So I said to her, \u201cI want to go back to my sister.\u201d And she said, \u201cYou are going to see her tomorrow.\u201d She was a good one. And then another SS woman came over, said, \u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d I cried harder. I said, \u201cBecause I want to go to your sister... to my sister.\u201d She said, \u201cYou'll never see her again.\u201d And since that point, I never cried again. Because first they, they cut your hair, and then they tattooed, and my hand got swollen like this. And lonesome, you have nobody. I was really transport from the same town, but they were no, not related to me. And I had nobody. And the following day when they took us to work, we saw the smoke coming out of the chimney and I put two and two together and I knew exactly what was going on, that they not around anymore. That\u2019s exactly how it was."

            "answer": "We all knew the same things. You couldn\u2019t figure out anything. You couldn\u2019t escape as far as this is concerned. You had to listen, and you had to be strong, and you had to help one another the best you were able to. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. I was always helping and one day, one morning... 1t was called the block, the place where you were staying. And every day somebody else had to go to get coffee in the morning. And... two people, because it looked like 12 a garbage barrel. With two and you had to carry. And that morning was my, my turn to go to get the coffee in the morning. Had to go to the kitchen. And sure enough I went and the other girl went and from nowhere a girl came along and she had a, a plate like a... you know, like a... I don\u2019t know what, how to... like she used to get the soup there. You know? They used to carry with you all the time. And she stopped the, the pot to get some coffee. And an SS woman saw her through the window. She came running out with the dog, and she poured the hot coffee, boiling coffee on my leg. And the skin came off right away. And... and that\u2019s it, and there was nobody to talk to. Nobody to, nobody to complain. Because nobody would listen to you. They would gas you. So, after being three weeks like that, and without medication. I used to put on, they had like a little blanket to cover yourself, whatever it was. And I used to, I ripped up a piece and I made like a, like a bandage. And it used to get stuck during the night and in the morning I used to take it off and I went to work like that. And couldn\u2019t go on no more. And I said, after three weeks, \u201cI can\u2019t go on no more to work. I cannot carry on.\u201d I said, \u2018\u201cWhatever\u2019s going happen, it\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019ll remain on the block.\u201d And you were not allowed to go to... to remain on the, on the block, because they would kill you. They would gas you the same day. So, I went to work and we were digging ditches and they moved away from there and I threw myself into the ditches and I figured Ill let me lay there. It\u2019s like a grave. Let me remain there. But somehow they walked away and I crept out and I went on Revier. The Revier meant, like a hospital. And they wouldn\u2019t accept no Jews, of course. So, I went in there and they accepted me. They asked me who did it. I said, \u201cI burned myself.\u201d I was not allowed to say that the SS woman did it to me. I says, \u201cI burned myself,\u201d and that\u2019s it. And they accepted me. You didn\u2019t get no help or medication or anything like that, but at least you had the rest. You didn\u2019t have to get up six o\u2019clock in the morning and stand outside for Zahl Appell. They used to count everyone in the morning. And this took an hour if it rained or snowed, whatever, they didn\u2019t care, because they were dressed. And so, I said to myself, at least I don\u2019t have to go through this. And that\u2019s the way I remained for two, three weeks, and then they had a big selection. And, and I don\u2019t know if you ever saw it, it\u2019s... the beds were like boards, you know what I\u2019m saying? Straight boards. And you were... it was down and up. It was two, two layers, the boards. And I was upstairs. And they said everybody should go down because they had like a selection."

And the SS came in and they said, \u201cEverybody come down from the bed. Used to call it colliers (ph). And... and everybody should go down. I touched my next door girl and the other side and they were dead. They came from Greece and they couldn\u2019t... they couldn\u2019t take the climate, because they were used to warm climate. And it, at that point it was not warm in, in Auschwitz. It was winter time. And they just, they used to fly, lay, they fell like flies. They went to bed and they never got up. And I said to myself, \u201cI don\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d This is all your head, you\u2019re talking to yourself. I don\u2019t stand a chance by going down, because you had to take off whatever you wore and parade through them naked. And if they like the way you looked, they put you one way and if they didn\u2019t, they gassed you. So, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to give them satisfaction. I\u2019m not going down.\u201d And I remained like that on the bed. Somebody carried on with you, you know, tell you not to do it. And the Doctor, Doctor Mengele was a very tall fellow. And he touched one, two, and here I was laying in the middle. And he didn\u2019t touch 13 me, because I was still warm. They could have taken me down and killed me.

We had a lot of mud and I lost a shoe. If you put your foot in, you couldn\u2019t take it out, you had to leave the shoe. And it was horrible. It was not to be believed that you could do that to people. And mostly young people, because they never chose elderly, because they didn\u2019t, they only needed you to work. And the elderly, of course, didn\u2019t have no strength, so they gassed them right away. But the younger ones, they... as long as they needed you, they used you and then after that they killed you. And that\u2019s it."

            "answer": "I had very bad experience with them. Like I said, we were in Birkenau and the first thing in the morning, after they, of course, cut my hair, put the number on and did everything else what they had to, separated us, of course, from the loved ones. And six o\u2019clock in the morning or five o\u2019clock in the morning, these four people from Czechoslovakia, they came before us. And they were real meanies. Mean. They had nothing nice about them. And the first thing out of their mouth at six o\u2019clock in the morning was \u201cPolska koovi stavach (ph).\u201d I... 1, the first time in my life, by that point, I heard. It meant, to explain it, \u201cPolish whores, get up.\u201d And I was so bewildered with that saying, because I didn\u2019t know even what a whore meant at that point. And that was my first greeting with the Kapos. And from then on, like I said, there was nobody that told you, but you figured out already what\u2019s going on and, and that\u2019s it. You cannot go under their nails, you cannot ask for anything, because you\u2019re not going to get it and you have to obey. You have to leave at a certain time your room and then that\u2019s it. You couldn\u2019t stay there. To remain on the bed? Never, because they would gas you right away. And like I said, luck was with me, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s luck, or... I always said, that through my life, through my stories I always feel that somebody carries on with you. Or whatever it happens in life, that somebody 15 carries on with you. It\u2019s God will. I shouldn\u2019t have gotten off the bed. Had I gotten off the bed, they would have taken me immediately. But like I said, my brain told me, you\u2019ll never make it. And don\u2019t get undressed and don\u2019t go through him. And I remained. And like I said before, I was in the Revier after a few weeks. And of course they didn\u2019t treat me, but at least I had the chance to... not to go outside. And then I got a better job. So the woman that took care on me, she was a Polish woman\u2014not took care, but she spoke to me, let\u2019s put it this way\u2014on the Revier, was a very nice person. So one day I approached her after being there maybe three or four months. So I, I asked her if... she used to come in the morning, she was wearing a white coat. And she was clean and she had a short hair cut. She was really pretty woman."

Do you want to drink it?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, who drinks dirty water?\u201d I said, \u201cI want to wash myself around the way you do. I want to be clean. I want to look good like you do.\u201d So, something went into her head and she, every day that she came in, in the morning, she brought me a, you know, a basin, a small basin with water with the soap and the dirt and everything when she washed herself. And I used to wash myself around. And I felt so good, like a million dollars. So I said to myself, how could I help the woman? I had no money. I can\u2019t give her no money. I can\u2019t give her nothing that I have of me. What could I do? I said, okay, I\u2019m going to help her to clean out. She was cleaning out under the beds, the walk. And I said, I have to help her. Before she gets here, I\u2019m going to do it and when she comes she won\u2019t have so much work. So, I told her. But when I went down, I could, I fainted from laying so long on the bed. That I couldn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t do. So I got up, and somebody helped me to go back on the bed. When she came in that day, I told her what happened. She says, \u201cIf you want to live, you must get off that bed.\u201d I said, \u201cSure I want to live.\u201d So, she said, \u201cBut let\u2019s do it...\u201d\u201d\" excuse me. \u201cYou start doing it before the SS comes 1n, before they change.\u201d So, I don\u2019t know what time it was, four or five o\u2019clock, I don\u2019t know. So I climbed down again from the bed and I was able to stand for a minute. So this was really a big accomplishment. And I took a chair and I pushed it. And I was walking, like jumping, I couldn\u2019t put down yet the foot all the way on the bottom, on the floor like. But every day I tried, until I got stronger.

I think it was from Turkey or I can\u2019t remember exactly from where it was. And this was to, to hold off the, the selections. And she said they were trying, they were looking for, for nurses. That pretty soon they were going to ask who wants to become a nurse. So, she said to me, \u201cI would advise you to volunteer for that.\u201d So, that\u2019s exactly what I did.

I took the doll and I threw it over the, the fence. And they caught me. And they pulled me out. And they cut my hair, again, because at that point already we had, you know, they let you have a little hair already.

First of all, they were evacuating us from Auschwitz, because the Russians came close and they did not... the Germans did not want to fall into the Russian hands. So, they evacuated us to Ravensbriick. Ravensbriick was another camp, but it was not as bad as Auschwitz. They didn\u2019t have the gassing chambers. It was just a concentration camp and there I got a job in the kitchen. And I was dishing out food and everybody came over, \u201cJospele, Jospele, give me some food.\u201d Just pour it in. You know, because I, it was not mine to begin with, and they were hungry. So I always did that. In that respect I was lucky, I always got good jobs. And then from Ravensbrick they transferred us to Switau. That\u2019s where we were liberated. And there, I was already there with nine, nine girls. All of us were Jewish girls. And somehow, like I said before, this was not a concentration camp. They couldn\u2019t gas you there. It was just working, a camp, a concentration, but without the, without the, what do you call that? The gas chambers. So, now we were there nine girls and there were a lot of Polish women that were from Auschwitz. And they exactly knew that we are Jews. So, one day we spoke among ourselves and we decided that we\u2019re not going to go in, all of us, together to wash in the morning, because we didn\u2019t want to be with anybody that should identify us. So, we ran in and we washed ourselves, like three of them and three stood outside. And that\u2019s the way we made it up. Sure enough, one day all of the Polish, and they were even anti-Semites. They were very mean. It\u2019s not that we took anything away, but they had to squeal, they had to tell that we are not, that we are not gentiles, we are Jews. And sure enough, one day they found out. And they went and they squealed. And they called us all out. These, these, these, you know, the numbers they called and we had to go in the front. And they said to us, \u201cAre you Jewish? Are you Jews?\u201d We said, \u201cNo.\u201d We made it up before, because we felt that it\u2019s the end. That was what it was trying to come. We heard the, you know, that\u2019s a battlefield going on. We heard the shooting. We heard the cannonen (ph), they used to call it, the... everything, but we didn\u2019t know exactly when it\u2019s going to be the end. We knew it\u2019s nearby. So, that\u2019s the way we made up, that we... each one was going to say, \u201cMy mother was Jewish, my father was a gentile.\u201d The other one said, \u201cMy father was gentile, my mother was Jewish.\u201d You know, all of us denying. And they looked, and they looked, and they looked and thank God, they didn\u2019t kill us. But... and then from there we went to Switau. This was the last camp."

The people from Biatystok, interviewed them. And they said... and that\u2019s when I got hit, when they wanted a doll for the Block elteste (ph), for the Kapo. And that\u2019s when I tried to organize and give it to her. And that\u2019s what happened. And that\u2019s when they said, in that transport my mother was, but I did not see her. I did not see anybody, no. That was last time. When I met them at, when we arrived in Auschwitz, I never saw them again. Always hoping, always searching, always looking, but of course, nothing. When I was in Paris, we lived in Paris for a year, after the war, of course. And I was always going on the trains, looking. In Europe the trains are much better than... you never saw a train, did you? Oh, in Washington they have beautiful trains. Here, because it was riding in Washington on the train. But by us in New York, the trains were horrible. And I always used to run from train to train. That\u2019s what I did in Paris, looking, the searching. From the back, look like my sister, from the back look like my brother. Always thinking, looking into their eyes, but of course, it was not them. But I always thought, yes, yes, I\u2019m going to find somebody. But that\u2019s it."

            "answer": "That\u2019s what kept me going. My friend told me that, too. Halina, the one from England. There was a time in my life when I was in Paris, I\u2019m going way ahead. This was after the war and we were liberated. And the Americans liberated us. And each of us from the nine girls that there were, had family in the United States. I had an uncle. This one had a sister and this one had in South America. Every one of us had family and they advised us that we shouldn\u2019t go back to Poland. They asked us, what do we want to do. And we said, we want to go to Poland to look for the family. And they advised us not to go back to Poland, because at that point already everything was shared up already, what belongs to whom. Poland belonged to Russia already. And they told us not to go, because we\u2019ll never get out of there. So, the only thing they advised, 23 advised us, excuse me, is we should go back to Paris. Excuse me. So, the Americans, the ones that liberated, advised us not to go back to Paris, uh, not to go back to Poland. We should go to Paris, from there the organizations will take over and we\u2019ll find our family and then we\u2019ll be able to get to them. So that\u2019s exactly what happened. They gave us a paper and they put us on, because we had no clothes. So, they gave us a paper, and they gave us uniforms that the WACs wore and they put us on the train. And we were going to Paris from Switau, from the Czechs, we were going to Paris. And on the way they took us off the train one stop and they said that we shouldn\u2019t talk to them, we should just give them the paper. And sure enough on the, the next stop they put us back on and we came to Paris. And there Rothschild gave us, it was a hotel. And they gave us the hotel for the misplaced people. And that\u2019s what it was. We slept two ina room and downstairs was a kitchen. So, and we used to be able to come down and eat. Now, I don\u2019t remember how long I was there, but I just couldn\u2019t go down with a dish again and eat. So, I cried so much. But it was more tears in the dish than it was food. And I decide I\u2019m going to cook for myself. And each floor, they had like a two burner. So, that\u2019s what happened. I bought some potatoes and that\u2019s what I used to cook. But of course, there was like a line. You know, you had to wait quite a while, but it was for me better not to go downstairs, but to cook and eat for myself. And so, that\u2019s where I got in with my friend. I slept with Halina, with my girlfriend. My cousin and another friend was in the other room. We were... we had nine rooms, one after the other. And at one point practically everybody found their family already and they were leaving. And of course, me, I didn\u2019t find my family, didn\u2019t find my uncle. And the only thing 1s, I said to myself and I said to them too, either he\u2019s very rich, he doesn\u2019t want to identify himself, or he died, one of the two, so many years. So..."

And there was nobody, nobody. And that day I was supposed to go to a funeral, also from, one from concentration camp. She lost her son of cancer, young fellow. And I was going to go to the funeral. And I had a ride. She didn\u2019t live too far from me, a few blocks. And when I came down on the block they told that they just left. They didn\u2019t wait for me. I was very disappointed and hurt, and unbelievable, how could you not wait? I don\u2019t know if up to today, if they forgot or they just didn\u2019t care. I don\u2019t know. Because right after this it happened. And I never... I don\u2019t know them so well. But being she lives on the block, I was going to go with their neighbor, which they were also survivors of the Holocaust. But like I said, I didn\u2019t know them so close. So I really don\u2019t know if they did it deliberately or if they forgot, because I never was able to discuss it with them. So, when I came there on the block and it was very short for me, maybe two blocks. So the neighbor said to me, \u201cWhom you looking for?\u201d So, I told her. She said, \u201cThey just left. Everybody left.\u201d So, I came home and I got undressed. This was on a Friday, and started to prepare for dinner. And I opened up the window. And the, I had a, a, you know, what they call that? For the air to come through. Like a shade or whatever it\u2019s called. And not thinking, not thinking, that God forbid somebody\u2019s going to climb in through that, open up the window and get in. And he hit me in the head, cut my face. I don\u2019t know, he broke my arms, they were hanging, both of them. He did something terrible. And my friend... me and his wife, she passed away, we were the best of friends from concentration camp. I\u2019m now friends with her daughters, always was. They live in New York... he knew that I was supposed to go to the funeral. He didn\u2019t go. And he kept calling. Called in the evening and no answer. So he couldn\u2019t figure it out what\u2019s going on. Then he thought maybe I went to, the woman that lost her son, to their daughter, to stay with them, help out. So, Sunday he came along to the house and I lived on the corner. And he walked around, parked the car and he walked around this way. \u201cJustine, Justine, where are you?\u201d And I don\u2019t know from what and when. I yelled out, \u201cHere Iam. Save me, help me.\u201d And that\u2019s when he heard my voice. Across the street was sitting women, neighbors. So they, he asked the neighbors, \u201cDid you see Justine?\u201d And she said \u201cNo, but I\u2019m wondering, the light is on. She never used to leave the light on. The light is on and I haven\u2019t seen her.\u201d So, when he heard that, he ran over to them and they climbed through the window, the kitchen window, because I had a porch, like a terrace like this, but higher. And they went in, one of them went in through the window and they found me laying on the floor in my bedroom in a puddle of blood. And that\u2019s when they called the police. And the police called an ambulance and that\u2019s why they put me into a hospital, a trauma hospital. And they called my son and that\u2019s what happened."

The Americans are here!\u201d What you heard them coming with motorcycles up the hill, you know, up and down, a lot of them. And they were wearing masks, like to see through, the dust shouldn\u2019t go into their eyes, I guess, and mouth. I mean, that\u2019s the way I assumed. And they all came to a certain spot. Like in the middle of the... and they, and they stopped. And they announced that the Americans... that they are the Americans and they came to liberate us. And we shouldn\u2019t be afraid. And of course, they had the business of picking up the Germans, too, that watched us. And I ran out from the bathroom with my pants down and I came to the spot and I pulled it up. And it was like a miracle, like, like you see it in the movies. You couldn\u2019t, you couldn\u2019t see it otherwise, and unbelievable too, that we are free. And they said to us, \u201cWe came to liberate you. Be very, very careful not...\u2019 \u2014this was on the second or on the third day, I remember\u2014 \u201cnot to pick up any food and conserves.\u201d They had a lot of things, the German, in jars. And we shouldn\u2019t eat no meat, because our stomachs are not used to it, because a lot of people fell and they died from it. And we should be very careful, if possible, we should mostly eat rice and drink water. And they were just like, like sisters and brothers we found. And among of them was a chaplain and he said to us, not to us, to everybody, to the whole camp, whoever is Jewish should come forward. And we were still hesitating, because we didn\u2019t trust anybody already. And a few minutes later we stepped out, all of us. He said not to be afraid, they\u2019ll try to help us in every way. And this was a few days later, about two, three days later, maybe. And that we shouldn\u2019t go back to Poland like I said before, because the Russians are there already. Everything was already arranged. And that they\u2019ll help us and everybody from among the nine of us had family in the United States, so we should come to, go to Paris and from there the organizations will take over.

They had the American flag going around and they had people from the media. And in the back of me, they had, they were taking pictures and they were talking, speeches. And there was a big, heavy cable. And all of a sudden a young gentleman touches me and he says to me, be careful. I shouldn\u2019t go back, because the cable, Ill fall. And the answer was I cannot fall anymore. I was fallen enough. And somehow, that youngster, I will never forget him, did not disappear from us. And he started to make conversations.

Do you go to college? Do you have to write thesis?\u201d I... we couldn\u2019t understand. He took us by train home, because he had a... he had a small car, so we couldn\u2019t go in, all of us, into the car. So left the car where it was parked on the cemetery, not far from there and he took us by train to go to the Washington, to the, where the monument is going to be erected. Because he asked us, where do we have to go? And for the first time we went on a train. A beautiful train in Washington. And then we went to the Capitol. We had lunch there and we paid for his lunch. And he wanted to spend with us a whole, a whole evening, but we were going from there on. But he found us so interesting. And 35 he was in law school and wanted, like you, and he wanted to know more and more about it. But he was a very nice gentleman.

And... and that\u2019s it. And that... because he wanted to know more and more and more. How do we feel out of life? How do... our outlook on life.

He used to bring them soap, a piece of chocolate and sardines. And if they had too much, they gave it to me. They shared with me a little bit, which was very nice of them. And that\u2019s when I found out more about it. And a short time later, they left. They went to South America, to Paraguay, which they had family there. And at this point everything was ready and they left. And my husband came around a few times, but I didn\u2019t pay no attention to him. And then he was discharged from the Army and he went back to the States. And he came in twice more. And the girls had made up with me, the two sisters, they knew I had nobody. At that point I didn\u2019t find my uncle yet... that if I want to come 36 to South America where they are, they have a brother, that is, that is, his wife was left in Poland. He left before the war, and the wife didn\u2019t get a chance to go out. And that they would want me very much in the family. And that\u2019s when all the trouble started. And I said, that\u2019s nice, that was very nice of them. But of course, they meant more for themselves than for me. And then my husband, I told him the story about what happened and after a while he came out and he told me the truth. They had mentioned to me that he was married before the war and they had one child. And my husband knew that he had two children. And he must have been old like my father."

I have to go and get a visa. And they\u2019re going to pay for the fare and everything. They knew I had no money. And then when my husband came back and he asked me, did I find my uncle. And I said, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cSo, what are you going to do?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to Paraguay, that Sonja and,\u201d oh I can\u2019t think of her name, the other one, \u201cwants me there. And they want me, they have a brother for me.\u201d And he knew the whole family, what was going on. Then it came out a few months later, didn\u2019t tell me right away, the truth. That he was married, I said, I knew, but he had two children. They only said he had one. And the age they didn\u2019t tell me. And he was almost the age like my father. And that\u2019s what happened. And then, so my husband said to me, \u201cGive me the, all the particulars that you knew about your uncle. Give it to 37 me.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired. I don\u2019t want it, anything else.\u201d The only thing is I could think is he\u2019s very rich, the same speech, or he\u2019s passed away. I remembered the children, their names, I remembered his name. I remembered his wife\u2019s name. But I did not remember the address where he lived. This my mother told us just before the war broke, before we were, we were separated, that we should all remember. And that\u2019s what happened, the address I forgot where he lived. And that\u2019s what it was so hard for him to find me, for me to find him, rather. Excuse me. And the papers that he read, there was a lot of Jewish papers them years. So, instead of The Day they called it, you read Good Morning. So, I put it in this paper and he read the other paper. So, so I gave my husband all the particulars, he went back to the States. And that\u2019s it. And two days later or three days later, I get a letter, my uncle. And he sent me twenty dollars, he put it into the envelope. But he just found out from the soldier, Mr. Lerner, that I\u2019m alive and he\u2019s going send out papers for me that I should come to the States here. And being nobody survived with me, my cousin, that was his sister, too. It was one brother and two sisters, so I was from one sister and my cousin was from the other sister. And he wants very, very much I should come to the United States. And that\u2019s the way it started. So, in the interim I, I sent him a letter. That I was mad, because I took it very wrong that he doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge himself. This was my pride, but it was not so. He was very, you know, devoted and healthy, happy that I\u2019m alive, that somebody\u2019s alive from the family. And interested, very, I should come and he\u2019Il try to help in every way. And that he\u2019s sending out papers. But then from there instead of sending me letters, they sent me telegrams. And they bought me already the, the, everything, they paid the fare in for me to go by plane to South America. And I started to put... and then he came again, my husband. I was over a year in Paris. And by that time, he came again, once more. He joined the Merchant Marines and he went back and forth. And he told me... and I told him what\u2019s on my mind. And when he told me that... yeah, a picture came from them. And he was in the back. Because I wrote them, \u201cI never got a picture, I never got a letter, I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. You don\u2019t keep your promise. I\u2019m not going to keep my promise.\u201d You know, that\u2019s the way I was talking to my... writing to my friends."

I had to go through Spain to go to them, through Spain, I had to stop in Spain. So, I had to have a visa from Spain. In the interim, Spain and Paris, and France didn\u2019t... had some kind of delay or whatever. They had some kind of argument. This was right after the war and they wouldn\u2019t allow anybody. So, I had to be stuck again in Paris. And that\u2019s what happened. I went back to ORT, ORT is a Jewish organization that they knew the whole story.

And then I decided I\u2019m not going to go. And I waited in Paris and my husband wanted to marry me. And I said, to myself, \u201cOkay.\u201d It was over a year. I couldn\u2019t find anybody. And we decided to get married. But in order for me and him, go together to the United States, we had to get married in Paris. So we had a beautiful wedding in Paris, invited all my friends.

And he was very, very nice to me. I adored that man. He was a very nice, pious man, very lovely and respectful, very respectful. And it was just a pleasure to be with him. We moved into him. And he wanted to give us everything, whatever he had. He wanted to give us his room. There were two bedrooms. I says, \u201cPa, how could I take your bedroom? It\u2019s yours.\u201d So, we slept the two of us, his bedroom was big and to the front, ours was like in a driveway. But I was happy that somebody accepted us and I was very grateful. And you go on with your, whatever you have to do. I went down in the morning to get breakfast, it was local, on the same block, a grocery, today you don\u2019t see it. Today you have supermarkets, big ones. That time everything was, and from the beginning when I went into the store everybody gave me their next. And then I figured out why, because they wanted to see if Ihave horns. (Laughing.) If I... how do I speak. It was a pleasure. I didn\u2019t have to wait on lines, but it didn\u2019t last long. Because after a while they heard that I\u2019m the same like they are, so they let me go to wait in line. And I used to shop, and bring home the food, and make three meals a day, and it was just like my mother did, the same thing."

If I] open up my mouth, of course you\u2019ll see ma foreigner, but I was never ashamed of being a foreigner. But I couldn\u2019t live with the number, because this made me different than everybody else. This I couldn\u2019t accept. So, when my son started to go to school, I said, that\u2019s when I\u2019Il take it off. And exactly I did that. And like I said before, I... if you ask me, \u201cOh that\u2019s what the 2\u201d No, this is my number and I\u2019m very proud of it. In the hospital, whenever I was, that\u2019s my number.

Had to take a dish towel from the kitchen or something to put it on top. It was like unacceptable in my, in my life. I can\u2019t do it.

So, that\u2019s why I put it there.\u201d But you couldn\u2019t catch me the second time already without anything. I used to put on a tape to cover it if I had to go out. All the time until I took it off. It was like a, I don\u2019t know, it was like a disbelief, a hurt. Not everybody felt the same way like me. A lot of my friends still have it, but I just couldn\u2019t live with it. I took it differently. And that\u2019s it."

And they were the ones that gave him the address and the name. And he did two people the same day, me and another woman a block away. So, I mean... and it was not a black boy. It was a white boy. So the mother is there. I should say that I feel sorry for the mother? No. That this would be a lie. She goes every day to court when it went on the case. I was not there. My son was not there. So we had a lawyer, but they couldn\u2019t fight it without us. He left me a cripple for the rest of my life and all the pain that I have with me, but nothing helped. Because he was there, and that\u2019s what he got, six and a half years. He\u2019ll come out, he\u2019ll do it again. But I can do nothing about it.

And that\u2019s the way I\u2019m doing it. I\u2019m enjoying it... I\u2019m not enjoying it, but \u2019m alive. Let\u2019s put it this way. Like for the holidays, my son belongs to a... the Reform temple, so I went with him. And the four doctors that used to take care on me in the hospital were there and they came over to wish me a happy New Year. And they couldn\u2019t get over how good you look. I said, \u201cThank God for the make-up.\u201d I always have something what to say. I said, \u201cThank God for the make-up, it covers all the sins.\u201d I says, \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d He said, \u201cA lot of people\u2019s make-up cannot do such a good job like this.\u201d (Laughing.)

Daniel\u2019s going to go along maybe later on a little bit. And I always visit them, because I lived in Brooklyn and they know I have the love for them and they have their love for me. I know they are very busy. I would like to see them more often. But I understand that not only do they have their life, but I can\u2019t demand anything from them, because I\u2019m not going to get it.

I cannot demand from anybody. Ill do myself. But my friend just lost her husband not long ago and he used to be, he used to take her all over and help her with every way. And she couldn\u2019t walk two blocks. Now of course, she finds it very, very hard. She has one daughter and the daughter is getting tired of it already. She has a family too and she works. I said, \u201cBetty, get a hold of yourself. She has her life too. You can\u2019t demand too much, because you\u2019re not going to get it. That\u2019s it.

So, he dropped me off at ten o\u2019clock in the morning. This was before I got hurt, before my accident. He dropped me off at ten o\u2019clock in the morning and she showed me the building.

So, the lady takes me for a walk and shows me the building. And then she showed me downstairs where all the senior citizens meet.

And of course, I was the youngest one, you could imagine. (Laughing.) One didn\u2019t hear, one didn\u2019t see, but I took everything fine, it\u2019s good. And I had my pocketbook with me, and I said to the 53 woman that I was working with, I said, where could I, where do you leave your bags? Where do you put your pocketbook? She says, \u201cPut it next to me on my... at the table. I\u2019Il sit over here and you\u2019ll sit next to me. We\u2019ll have lunch together.\u201d I says, fine, thank you.

What\u2019s the matter?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s my seat.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I'll take it away. I didn\u2019t know. The other one told me, that lady told me I could sit over here, no big deal.\u201d And it threw me off so much, that I just... I wasn\u2019t used to it. I said, \u201cAh, that\u2019s not for me. Let them stay with them. I\u2019m not going to come back.\u201d And since then, I went again. I went to a concert there not long ago. I try, but somehow, I don\u2019t get... 1t\u2019s not for me. I can\u2019t be like that, them... it\u2019s like anything else, I don\u2019t know them. Let\u2019s put it this way. And to get acquainted at this point and to have their lunches, which I don\u2019t care for, it brings back too many memories. So, I\u2019d rather stay home.
