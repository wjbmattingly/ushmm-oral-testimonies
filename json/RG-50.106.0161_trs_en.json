They paraded around in their brown shirts. Some of the children in the neighborhood joined the Hitlerjugend, the Hitler Youth. And of course there was always the spectacle of the marches up and down.

It didn\u2122t take lo ng though, before this atmosphere of fear set it. Very early, probably in 1933, we\u2122d began to have what in retrospect I find very surprising, blackout drills. Had to put curtain -- not curtains, but blankets on the windows, don\u2122t turn on any lights. Cars down below had to paint their head -- headlights blue.

Once a week people were required to have a meal that was prepared in one pot, and the amount of money that was saved, presumably, by having a thick so up or something of that sort, was to be given to the poor. During the winter the Nazis would co me knocking on the door, peek in the pots, and collect what you presumably saved. To this day I do not like to eat pea soup or lentil soup, for that reason."

A four is a four is a four in no matter what language, and if I could manipulat e those, then pick up a little bit more each time. A very kind teacher put a book in front of me with a map, and then she said, geography. North, south, east, west, pointing at the directions. And little by little I picked up some English.

That is not done, but I insisted on doing it anyway. It took a long time for that kind of thing to wear away.

            "answer": "Yes. Not of my own volition. For many years -- for about 60 years, I refused to set foot in that place. Then, in 1995 a professor at der Ruhr University, which didn\u2122t exist when I lived there, managed to persuade th e city fathers to bring back people from various parts of the world, those who were still alive, and bring them back for a reunion in Bochum . The -- the mayor was of a different party, and previous parties Interview with Lore Schneider August 14, 2003 36who were in charge of the city were not pa rticularly interested, but this mayor said, okay, let\u2122s do it. So they began writing letters to those people that they could reach. One of the ways that they reached me is sort of interesting. A, one of the people that stayed in Germany had a sister who lived in ing -- in Israel. This woman was in touch with one of our school friends who lives in Cape Town. And when they started trying to locate people who had formerly lived in Bochum, she was telling one of her best friends about this. Well, this best friend is my cousin, who also lives in Cape Town. S-So through this long way around, they located me and wrote a letter. And I was very dubious about going, I hesitate d many months. Then the prof essor and his wife were -- and son were on a trip to the United States, and he wrote and said, we\u2122re going to be in the Washington area. We\u2122d like to meet you, we\u2122d like to go to the museum, we hear tickets are very hard to come by. Well, he asked the right person. And we arranged for tickets for him. And then when he called, said he\u2122d like to meet us, I was still skeptical, I thought, what kind of a Nazi could this be? But we decided to take a chance and we met him in town for dinner. And he turned out to be a most extraordinary person. So much so that we planted a tree in Israel in his honor. He is absolutely, unbelievably dedica ted. And he kind of took the fear away of going, so we went in 1995. And there we met some peop le that I hadn\u2122t seen since we were children. They took us all around the city and showed us what was left, what was rebuilt, what isn\u2122t there any more. And since that time we\u2122ve been in contact with Interview with Lore Schneider August 14, 2003 37these people. A year ago he and his wife came to the States and visited some of the former residents that they had met in past y ears, they went to various locations in the States. And next month a woman who lives in northern Virginia who didn\u2122t go on that first trip, although she had been to Germany several times, she is going to go by herself with a friend, she is now a widow. She is going to go and she will get more or less the same program that the rest of us had back in \u212295."

I was just sent a clipping from the German newspaper that dealt with the experiences of my school friend of Germany who now lives in Cape Town. In Cape Town they have just opened a Holocaust Museum.
