Some of the children in the neighborhood joined the Hitlerjugend, the Hitler Youth. And of course there was always the spectacle of the marches up and down. We lived on the corner of a main street, and the spectacle of the parades up and down with the flags, the music, the torches, and get away from that window. The atmosphere of fear."

            "answer": "I guess just a normal childhood. Playing in the park and learning to ice skate, playing with other children. It didn\u2019t take long though, before this atmosphere of fear set it. Very early, probably in 1933, we\u2019d began to have what in retrospect I find very surprising, blackout drills. Had to put curtain -- not curtains, but blankets on the windows, don\u2019t turn on any lights. Cars down below had to paint their head -- headlights blue. And in retrospect, in the early 30\u2019s, I find this very surprising."

            "question": "Was there any explanation for this?",
            "answer": "That was the way it was done. I was young enough not to know any real reason. The other thing was the so-called Winterhilfe. Once a week people were required to have a meal that was prepared in one pot, and the amount of money that was saved, presumably, by having a thick soup or something of that sort, was to be given to the poor. During the winter the Nazis would come knocking on the door, peek in the pots, and collect what you presumably saved. To this day I do not like to eat pea soup or lentil soup, for that reason."

            "answer": "It didn\u2019t take long, but the young people who lived in this building, showing up in their Nazi uniforms, other people and pushing people around. My father was arrested for no good reason. His law partner was beaten up in an alley and left for dead. Fortunately he wasn\u2019t and managed to emigrate to Israel in later years.

And they invited my father to come to the United States, look around for a few weeks and see if it was possible to come and possibly make a living and then decide to apply for a visa.

And my father said, I don\u2019t think it will stop. And he made up his mind and he is fortunate, some members of his family were fortunate to get out. Others were not so fortunate, were lost.

            "answer": "I would say it was just more of the same. More of the marches up and down the street, more of your child laughed at that -- a-a-at our man in uniform, you\u2019re gonna get in trouble. Or just watch very carefully where you walk, how you walk. Stay out of trouble. Just don\u2019t call attention to yourself in any way."

            "answer": "No, it was not shut down until after I had left. And at that time my teacher made it her business to teach those children that were still there even after the school disappeared. She taught them in a house, a Juden house and then she began smuggling them, at great risk to herself, across the border into the Netherlands. Bochum is not far from the Dutch border.

So, a few items of furniture, they were allowed to take books, my mother\u2019s music and some of my favorite books, a doll. And tha -- that\u2019s it.

We stayed in Amsterdam for a day or two, then went to Rotterdam, took a boat across the English channel. We were down in -- way down in the bottom, next to the machinery in that boat, getting very seasick. We went from London to a port that the British pronounce, I think Harrich, it\u2019s spelled Harwich. And from there we took a smallish steamboat called The Corinthia, that took a little over a week to get to New York. The Corinthia was subsequently sunk during World War II."

Also, at that time, people were not going through Ellis Island. The immigration people were coming on the ship. The ship landed late in the day.

There were -- there was a Set of twins there, cousins, who were four years old, who gave me a terrible time because I couldn\u2019t speak English. Then we moved into our own apartment, also in Washington. And I was very shy and retiring because nobody would speak to me, I couldn\u2019t speak to them. So it took awhile, but we came in the summertime and it wasn\u2019t long before I was enrolled in the local elementary school. That was a traumatic experience also, especially since I was tall for my age and they wanted to put me back a grade because I couldn\u2019t speak English. I fought like crazy to not be put back another year. I finally succeeded in that, and worked very hard to try and pick up enough English to go on. My bridge to English were numbers. A four is a four is a four in no matter what language, and if I could manipulate those, then pick up a little bit more each time. A very kind teacher put a book in front of me with a map, and then she said, geography. North, south, east, west, pointing at the directions. And little by little I picked up some English. The running joke in my family is a spelling word on my first spelling test. These days the children can spell much more complicated words, but that was Queen. I spelled it k-w-i-n."

In those days the school years were divided into two halves, A and B and you could move -- you could enter school in the spring semester, for instance. So I Interview with Lore Schneider : August 14, 2003 went to summer school after that first year, made up one semester, and then had a combined second half of fifth grade, first half of sixth grade. Went to summer school again the following year, and that way I got even with others in my age group. Following that I went to summer school in high school, made up another year and graduated at 16."

The Committee rounded up a number of lawyers who knew the German law and made them temporary colonels in the U.S. Army, and they worked on particular cases. They stayed for several months, my father stayed for about six months. So the private in the German army during World War I became a temporary colonel in the U.S. Army."

            "answer": "Yes. Not of my own volition. For many years -- for about 60 years, I refused to set foot in that place. Then, in 1995 a professor at der Ruhr University, which didn\u2019t exist when I lived there, managed to persuade the city fathers to bring back people from various parts of the world, those who were still alive, and bring them back for a reunion in Bochum. The -- the mayor was of a different party, and previous parties Interview with Lore Schneider *\u00b0 August 14, 2003 who were in charge of the city were not particularly interested, but this mayor said, okay, let\u2019s do it. So they began writing letters to those people that they could reach. One of the ways that they reached me 1s sort of interesting. A, one of the people that stayed in Germany had a sister who lived in ing -- in Israel. This woman was in touch with one of our school friends who lives in Cape Town. And when they started trying to locate people who had formerly lived in Bochum, she was telling one of her best friends about this. Well, this best friend 1s my cousin, who also lives in Cape Town. S-So through this long way around, they located me and wrote a letter. And I was very dubious about going, I hesitated many months. Then the professor and his wife were -- and son were on a trip to the United States, and he wrote and said, we\u2019re going to be in the Washington area. We\u2019d like to meet you, we\u2019d like to go to the museum, we hear tickets are very hard to come by. Well, he asked the right person. And we arranged for tickets for him. And then when he called, said he\u2019d like to meet us, I was still skeptical, I thought, what kind of a Nazi could this be? But we decided to take a chance and we met him in town for dinner. And he turned out to be a most extraordinary person. So much so that we planted a tree in Israel in his honor. He is absolutely, unbelievably dedicated. And he kind of took the fear away of going, so we went in 1995. And there we met some people that I hadn\u2019t seen since we were children. They took us all around the city and showed us what was left, what was rebuilt, what isn\u2019t there any more. And since that time we\u2019ve been in contact with Interview with Lore Schneider 7 August 14, 2003 these people. A year ago he and his wife came to the States and visited some of the former residents that they had met in past years, they went to various locations in the States. And next month a woman who lives in northern Virginia who didn\u2019t go on that first trip, although she had been to Germany several times, she is going to go by herself with a friend, she is now a widow. She is going to go and she will get more or less the same program that the rest of us had back in 795."
