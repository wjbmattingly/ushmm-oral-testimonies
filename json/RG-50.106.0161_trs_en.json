The people who owned the house in which we rented an apartment, their o -- late teens to early 20\u2019s sons were among the first je -- to join the party. They paraded around in their brown shirts. Some of the children in the neighborhood joined the Hitlerjugend, the Hitler Youth. And of course there was always the spectacle of the marches up and down. We lived on the corner of a main street, and the spectacle of the parades up and down with the flags, the music, the torches, and get away from that window. The atmosphere of fear."

            "answer": "I guess just a normal childhood. Playing in the park and learning to ice skate, playing with other children. It didn\u2019t take long though, before this atmosphere of fear set it. Very early, probably in 1933, we\u2019d began to have what in retrospect I find very surprising, blackout drills. Had to put curtain -- not curtains, but blankets on the windows, don\u2019t turn on any lights. Cars down below had to paint their head -- headlights blue. And in retrospect, in the early 30\u2019s, I find this very surprising."

            "question": "Was there any explanation for this?",
            "answer": "That was the way it was done. I was young enough not to know any real reason. The other thing was the so-called Winterhilfe. Once a week people were required to have a meal that was prepared in one pot, and the amount of money that was saved, presumably, by having a thick soup or something of that sort, was to be given to the poor. During the winter the Nazis would come knocking on the door, peek in the pots, and collect what you presumably saved. To this day I do not like to eat pea soup or lentil soup, for that reason."

            "answer": "It didn\u2019t take long, but the young people who lived in this building, showing up in their Nazi uniforms, other people and pushing people around. My father was arrested for no good reason. His law partner was beaten up in an alley and left for dead. Fortunately he wasn\u2019t and managed to emigrate to Israel in later years. But when things began to happen that way, he said it was time to get out."

            "question": "Once he decided it was time to go, what efforts did he make to leave Germany?",
            "answer": "Well, we were more fortunate than most. My mother had a sister who came to live in the United States with her family following World War I. And they invited my father to come to the United States, look around for a few weeks and see if it was possible to come and possibly make a living and then decide to apply for a visa. And they then signed an affidavit for us that permitted us to come into this country."

And my father said, I don\u2019t think it will stop. And he made up his mind and he is fortunate, some members of his family were fortunate to get out. Others were not so fortunate, were lost.

            "answer": "I would say it was just more of the same. More of the marches up and down the street, more of your child laughed at that -- a-a-at our man in uniform, you\u2019re gonna get in trouble. Or just watch very carefully where you walk, how you walk. Stay out of trouble. Just don\u2019t call attention to yourself in any way."

And at that time my teacher made it her business to teach those children that were still there even after the school disappeared. She taught them in a house, a Juden house and then she began smuggling them, at great risk to herself, across the border into the Netherlands. Bochum is not far from the Dutch border.

My parents were beginning to study conversational Hebrew in case we couldn\u2019t get into the United States. I had a little bit of Hebrew in school of course, but that was prayer book Hebrew, and no English whatever."

[ thought I would find Indians, and my father had visited the relatives who lived, at the time in Chevy Chase, D.C., and he said it\u2019s next to Maryland.

So, a few items of furniture, they were allowed to take books, my mother\u2019s music and some of my favorite books, a doll. And tha -- that\u2019s it.

One of my father\u2019s brothers was listed as fashon, which means assumed dead. He was deported, but they don\u2019t know the actual date. One of my mother\u2019s brothers, a younger brother, we managed to bring to the United States with his family. An older brother lived through most of the war, but managed to come to the United States. My father\u2019s oldest brother was deported and killed. Another brother escaped to South Africa. And another brother was incarcerated in Dachau for a number of months, but was released and managed to come to the United States with his family.

My mother had a friend in Amsterdam, and when we crossed the border into the Netherlands and everybody took a deep breath, we\u2019re out of there. We stayed in Amsterdam for a day or two, then went to Rotterdam, took a boat across the English channel. We were down in -- way down in the bottom, next to the machinery in that boat, getting very seasick. We went from London to a port that the British pronounce, I think Harrich, it\u2019s spelled Harwich. And from there we took a smallish steamboat called The Corinthia, that took a little over a week to get to New York. The Corinthia was subsequently sunk during World War II."

Also, at that time, people were not going through Ellis Island. The immigration people were coming on the ship. The ship landed late in the day.

            "answer": "Well, the first few weeks we lived with -- with our relatives. There were -- there was a Set of twins there, cousins, who were four years old, who gave me a terrible time because I couldn\u2019t speak English. Then we moved into our own apartment, also in Washington. And I was very shy and retiring because nobody would speak to me, I couldn\u2019t speak to them. So it took awhile, but we came in the summertime and it wasn\u2019t long before I was enrolled in the local elementary school. That was a traumatic experience also, especially since I was tall for my age and they wanted to put me back a grade because I couldn\u2019t speak English. I fought like crazy to not be put back another year. I finally succeeded in that, and worked very hard to try and pick up enough English to go on. My bridge to English were numbers. A four is a four is a four in no matter what language, and if I could manipulate those, then pick up a little bit more each time. A very kind teacher put a book in front of me with a map, and then she said, geography. North, south, east, west, pointing at the directions. And little by little I picked up some English. The running joke in my family is a spelling word on my first spelling test. These days the children can spell much more complicated words, but that was Queen. I spelled it k-w-i-n."

This cousin had four children, the oldest remained in England, they were part of the Kindertransport. A son joined the American army, he was injured in the invasion, in the D-Day invasion. And through him -- and we visited him in the veteran\u2019s hospital -- through him we were beginning to hear more and more about what they saw in Europe. Even though he was wounded right in the beginning, through his buddies in the army, we found out a lot."

A, one of the people that stayed in Germany had a sister who lived in ing -- in Israel. This woman was in touch with one of our school friends who lives in Cape Town. And when they started trying to locate people who had formerly lived in Bochum, she was telling one of her best friends about this. Well, this best friend 1s my cousin, who also lives in Cape Town. S-So through this long way around, they located me and wrote a letter. And I was very dubious about going, I hesitated many months. Then the professor and his wife were -- and son were on a trip to the United States, and he wrote and said, we\u2019re going to be in the Washington area. We\u2019d like to meet you, we\u2019d like to go to the museum, we hear tickets are very hard to come by. Well, he asked the right person. And we arranged for tickets for him. And then when he called, said he\u2019d like to meet us, I was still skeptical, I thought, what kind of a Nazi could this be? But we decided to take a chance and we met him in town for dinner. And he turned out to be a most extraordinary person. So much so that we planted a tree in Israel in his honor. He is absolutely, unbelievably dedicated. And he kind of took the fear away of going, so we went in 1995. And there we met some people that I hadn\u2019t seen since we were children. They took us all around the city and showed us what was left, what was rebuilt, what isn\u2019t there any more.
