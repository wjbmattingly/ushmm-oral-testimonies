For example, if my husband get transferred to other city, they didn't separate the wife. If they are close, it is, they said he has to travel, but if was a farther city, they somehow, very difficult way, they give you a transfer. That means I got stick there, Barbara Farkas 61 December 9, 1995 I couldn't get out from that lab. And otherwise, the lab, the salary and the benefits were good. That means was no reason for me, for change job, only this guy was, I didn't feel, not myself, not my colleague, we felt, feel well with his behavior."

And on that night we heard the bombardment, the airplanes, the molotov, we saw the molotov cocktails, I mean the lights, the dogs were barking terrible, were very, very scary. Plus we were listening to the radio, to the small radio, in those, how you call it, shelters, some, not shelter, not shelters, just the name was shelter, and we were listening to the radios, and we were listening, heard the Israeli speaker said what Nassar was saying that they will kill all the Jew and push them in the sea and so on. You know, and that atmosphere from outside, those noise, those shelters, and this, this kind of speech from Nassar, I get scary. The Israeli were laughing about, you know. They were heroes, every Israeli, they are heroes, but I was scary, I tell you that I was scary. And one of the cause that I decided to come to America, not for good, just for a year, to study, that was one of the cause. We didn't sell the apartment, we rented the apartment, I get a year permission from my job to, nonpay vacation, I mean don't pay leave of absence and that was the day, yeah, and also we met a family from Cincinnati who were a young couple, a rabbi, __________ with his wife. And I ask her about America, you know. And she told me, and I tell her that we would like to come, I would like to come for a year to America to study. And she gave me some addresses in Boston. I said I want to come to Boston because we have, from my husband's side, we have, he has a cousin who liv es around, but I didn't want to ask him to help us to come, I mean to Barbara Farkas 68 December 9, 1995 send an affidavit or something that, we didn't want to ask him from, for that. And she gave me some addresses here in Boston, some hospitals and she was very nice and she brought the let ters to this hospital because I didn't know English, very little. I understand what I read, but I couldn't speak and I write a letter to a hospital personnel service. And she brought some letters saying what I am doing, what kind of diploma I have and that I would like to come to America for one year study. And after a short time, maybe a month, maybe less, I get answers from three hospitals here in Boston. And we got letter with one of the letters, I went to the American Embassy in Tel Aviv and I show them the letter and that letter was written the day they would like to accept me, can I come to America, to give me a job in the church, you know. I show that letter to the Embassy and they give me some forms to fill out, those forms. We fill it out, that was in August, August, September, and they send me a other, other papers to fill out, forms. And so around October they call us and said to go to Tel Aviv to a doctor to make some medical visits. We went, he did the checkups and after a very short time, in Dec ember, we get the permission to come to America with __________, you know what means the __________, it's a very good preference, they give that only to people with university, to the artist, to, you know, people with education. And we get in December that permission, but we can't come because my husband has some problem with his ear. And everybody, our friends, told do the operation here Barbara Farkas 69 December 9, 1995 in Jerusalem because in America cost so much that you can't pay it. And really, he had the operation at the Hadasah(ph) hospital in Jerusalem and until he recover was already January. And we have time, I think six months to leave after we get the permission to come to America. And in February, he was already okay and in February 12th, we left. We rented apartment and in 12 February we left. I get the permission from my job to leave for a year and so on. My job remain open and that was it. When I came here I get the job that they promise to give me, but what happens? My husband, I get the job immediately, after one week, we s tay, we came here in America. My husband had a little problem, after one month, he get a job as a accountant at a company and we didn't rent the apartment, we rented a furnish apartment, a one bedroom furnish apartment. My daughter, I put her, my daughter in, __________ school, high school and for her was very easy because her Hebrew was perfect, that mean she didn't have, __________ is a school then where Israel, Orthodox high school, but they, boys and girls they learn together, it's not a very, very orth odox school. It's a very good school, many students from there goes to Harvard and MIT, it's a very well known and good school. And she went there and everything was looking fine. After one year, I went back to Israel to see, yeah, because the lease expire at my apartment. We went back and what I find in my apartment I cry, how destroyed the apartment was by those people who rented the apartment. And I get older, my husband in that time was thinking, he was not Barbara Farkas 70 December 9, 1995 decided that he wants to go back. I tell you w hy. He lose his pension rights in Romania, he was there almost 20 years in Romania, he lose that pension, if he go, if he, when we left Israel, even for a year, you lose your __________, the means you are not any more, I mean he was in that situation, I, m y job was open, he lose his job over there and when I went to his job place, they said that they filled out his job with a Russia guy because in that time start to come the Russia, not too many, but a few. And they give his job to a Russia man. When my husband, then I came back and I told to my husband that your job is not open any more, he was very, very hurt. And he said, \"Look, I don't have pension, not in Romania, not in Israel, what I going to do to go back to Israel and start from beginning, from the low level?\" In six year he get advance to higher, higher jobs. And he said, \"Look, you know what, I am not going back. I like my job here and I am, we not going back\". I was crying and I feel like a traitor, traitor?"

If we stay here, that will be different\". And I recognize that he is right and very difficult way, I agree to stay here, to don't go back. Then I, after a few months, after one year when the second lease expire, I went back and I sold the apartment. That means the apartment was Barbara Farkas 71 December 9, 1995 sold and we stood here. I forgot to tell you, when we came here, after a very short time, we get the, oh, at the American Consulate, they told us that if we go to America only for a year, my husband is, can't work in America because I get the permission to come to study, not my husband, that means he can't work because he doesn't have any basis to work here. But if he want, he wants to work, do it in this way. Ask for immigration, if you ask for immigration, he is a new immigrant, he can get a job and he can stay. But if you want, even if you are with immigration, you can go back to Israel any times. And we said okay, this is not a problem, we'll do it in that way. And we did it in that way. That's why, when we came here, after a 10 days, we get the green card, send it home by mail, you know. That mean s everything was okay with the immigration. We have the green card and that was very, very, very fine for us. We are arrived to work and to stay as a immigrant. That was it."

In that time, in Romania, instead of Boy Scouts, you know, they have other group they call it, Strachere(ph), that means, Strachere means who is willing to, to look for the safe of something. Here in this case, was the safe of the country.

Even she was not so good at all. But what happen, when we have the graduation exam, the so called baccalaureate, in Romania, I think still is the same rule, after you finish the high school, is a very, very difficult exam, they call it baccalaureate, when you have that exam, to Oradia, they came from other cities, girls, in the school where I was studying, at least three or four schools with girls, girls, they came to give this Barbara Farkas 76 December 9, 1995 baccalaureate to the same school where I was studying. The committee who was in that exam, they were professor not from our school, was a absolutely neutral commission, the president of the commission was a university professor and the teachers who were in that commission were from other school from where there were no students in that, in that, at that baccalaureate. At that baccalaureate exam we were around 150 girls and I pass the second one with, you know, the grade, I was the second on the grade.
