This interview is part of the museum\u2019s project to interview Holocaust survivors and witnesses who are also volunteers with the museum. This is a follow-up interview that will focus on Mr. Stein\u2019s post- Holocaust experiences. In preparation for this interview I listened to the interview you conducted with the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation on February 27\", 1997. I will not ask you to repeat everything you said in that interview, instead I will use this interview as an opportunity to follow up on that interview and focus on your post-Holocaust experiences. This is tape number one, side A. What was your name at birth?",
            "answer": "My name was Karl Robert Stein. The only thing that is different from \u2014 from present time is the first name. Karl was changed to Charles, but it \u2014 actually, I didn't change it. It was changed by the authorities in Luxembourg when they issued me a passport. They simply wrote in there, and my name in \u2014 in that Luxembourg stateless passport on which I traveled after I left Austria was \u2014 they Interview with Charles Stein : June 8, 1999 translate it into the French, Charles, which is the same as \u2014 same spelling as Charles and that\u2019s remained that way."

I\u2019d studied English. And so \u2014 I\u2019d seen, you know, American movies and all that. So my \u2014 they called me, and \u2014 Charlie. Actually, th-the way it sounded then, as they pronounced it, it sounded more like Sharlie. So, it was nothing really new to me, and I remained with that."

            "answer": "Through Europe? Yes, the only one that I encountered on the way through the \u2014 in the campaign was Nordhausen, concentration camp Nordhausen, which we came upon not knowing where we \u2014 that there was a concentration until we \u2014 til we ran into it. It was a \u2014 1t was a horrible experience. Knowing that my parents must be in one of those, I \u2014 I sort of instinctively started looking around to see if I could see my parents. It wa \u2014 it was a \u2014 an impression that stayed with me for a long time. It was the \u2014 bodies lying around, people wandering around in a daze. We tried Interview with Charles Stein \u00b0 June 8, 1999 to, the little time that we had, we were moving pretty fast at the time, chasing the rest of the Germans in the direction of the \u2014 of the Russians. And we were there for about a day or two, I did interrogate some of the guards. They \u2014 some of them, as I recall, were Ukrainian guards that the survivors of \u2014 of the camp \u2014 many of them by the way in Nordhausen w-was one of the camps that had a lot of slave labors from eastern Europe, a lot of Yugoslavs that I encountered there. They wanted those guards. And if I lost any of them on the way, I \u2014 I-I can\u2019t remember. But they \u2014 the guards were scared. I recall one guard, who absolutely refused to talk. And we had ways of, you know, interrogate \u2014 ways of interrogate \u2014 this \u2014 this was not a friendly interrogation, so we made them talk. Not by physical force in any way, but by \u2014 oh, various things. Like we have him take off his clothes. And when a man stands there in front of you without his clothes on, he\u2019ll start talking pretty soon, we found out. That\u2019s an interesting thing we learned over \u2014 over the \u2014 we sort of picked up as we went through the war and \u2014 interrogation techniques that they didn\u2019t teach us in school. But he f \u2014 he talked and I got \u2014 I got his story, of course, I can\u2019t remember the details now. But I did get a \u2014 the story of some of the atrocities that the \u2014 they were \u2014 they committed. I turned the people over \u2014 the \u2014 the guards over to the military police that picked them up and took them back to prison camps. Interview with Charles Stein \u2018 June 8, 1999"

            "question": "You also said that you employed techniques that you didn\u2019t learn in school. Can you tell me a little bit about your training in \u2014 in some of the techniques that you were trained to use and some of the ones you learned along the way\u201d?",
            "answer": "Yes, well, in the military I was \u2014 I was \u2014 I went to \u2014I was originally in field artillery. I went to officer candidate school and became \u2014 I was an artillery officer. And then I was, shortly after graduation at Fort Sill, Oklahoma where the artillery school was, I was tapped for intelligence because of my background in languages and so forth. I was called one night \u2014 one evening I was called in and was told that Washington, in quotes, at that time wanted me to go to \u2014 wanted me to go to the intelligence school, which was at Fort Ritchie, right in \u2014 1n Maryland here, then called Camp Ritchie. That was the military intelligence school and we went through interrogation training and all kinds of intelligence training. Oh, we learned all kinds of things like Morse code, which I have never used in my life. Don\u2019t know anybody who ever did, and folder interpretation, map reading of foreign maps, which was important because some of the captured maps we had to \u2014 to know what we saw, and we had all kinds of field training with those. These were Interview with Charles Stein \u00b0 June 8, 1999 Maryland \u2014 Maryland maps, maps of the \u2014 of the Ritchie area, but printed in various languages including Japanese. I remember one night that they dropped me off someplace at a place and gave me this \u2014 this map. And from landmarks and all that, you identified where you were and which way you were going. Well, that was important but in \u2014 basically for me that was not a problem because I was fluent in German, of course, my native language, I also knew French. And that\u2019s the direction we went in, so once we got there, I could easily read those maps if \u2014 if necessary. We were trained in order of battle, identifying \u2014 we learned everything about the German \u2014 we knew more about the German army, their uniforms, their \u2014 their insignia. That was all part of \u2014 of the training and the units, the organization of the German army, what units looked like, what they were, how ba \u2014 how strong they were, etcetera. That was all part of it because that was all part of \u2014 of the interrogation process. And so when we \u2014 when I got into \u2014 to the combat are \u2014 zone, interrogating the people was simple. One thing, for example, was that every German had what was called a soldbuch, a paybook. Now that soldbuch \u2014 soldbuch had all his military a-assignments listed in there. And it was easy to figure out who he was and what he was. So the first thing we\u2019d ask them is, give me your soldbuch. And they would hand it over and you had them right there, that was \u2014 now you knew. And so then you would say, oh you were from the 338\" Interview with Charles Stein \u201d June 8, 1999 Fisilier-Batallion(ph), yeah? And he\u2019d say yeah, and take it from there. Most of the interrogations were actually not difficult. Most of them talked. Now you ran into some, officers mainly, who said name, rank and serial number, that\u2019s all they would give you. But again, you \u2014 we \u2014 all of us, I think, found ways to \u2014 to break them. For example is one thing, a German, regardless of whether you were friend or enemy, respected rank. So you made sure that the insignia you were \u2014 you were wearing at the time, and we had a complete collection of it, were at least one rank higher than the man we had, and we could read that. So we \u2014 we played that game, it was \u2014 if you had time for it. Now a lot of \u2014 most of it was right up in the front lines, so you didn\u2019t have time to \u2014 to play games. And at those times we would just play tough, yeah. Threaten, all kinds of things, you know, we would \u2014 we \u2014 we\u2019d say \u2014 we\u2019d tell them, okay, we\u2019ll let you walk back home, right through the front lines. Of course they wouldn\u2019t do that cause they\u2019d get shot. And things like that, and they would \u2014 I don\u2019t really recall anyone I could not break in an \u2014 in an interrogation, and I\u2019ve interrogated thousands of them. Now, what we did with the information, and we \u2014 we \u2014 in my case, being in the front lines, I would \u2014 my targets were who was opposing us, how strong are they, where are they located, what kind of weapons do they have, where\u2019s their artillery. And I would immediately call in to artillery to give them the coordinate of locations so that they Interview with Charles Stein \" June 8, 1999 could fire on it, and my infantry units that I supported would get all the information \u2014 the \u2014 the intelligence officer of the unit would get all the information that was relevant to who \u2014 who was on the other side of the line, what was their morale, how \u2014 how strong were they, what kind of weapons did they have. And that went \u2014 well, we had a lot of good results. One of the things that I and my team always did was when we had specific targets that we could identify, after we had pushed through the area we checked those targets to make su \u2014 to see if they had been hit like we \u2014 and I think most of them were. So, it was \u2014 in Normandy it was \u2014 is rough, cause we were going from hedgerow to hedgerow, you know, one hedgerow at a time, and you know, a hundred \u2014 a hundred yards a day, things like that. But after that, of course, on the run, that was a little different. Once we broke through, it was \u2014 it was a different story, it was easier then."

            "question": "You mentioned in your interview for the Shoah Foundation that British intelligence was superior to American intelligence. Can you clarify that point for me?",
            "answer": "Yes, I\u2014I went to \u2014I was shipped to England in December of 1943. I was in England until \u2014 until D-Day, so that was six months from \u2014 in England. And at the time I was sent to \u2014 from where we were out in the near \u2014 in the country somewhere, I was sent to London to study with \u2014 with British intelligence. They Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Charles Stein \" June 8, 1999 had some schools and they \u2014 they took us into \u2014 and gave us some \u2014 some information. The British had a lot more experience. We had absolutely no experience, we were new. We were \u2014 all of \u2014 not \u2014 I\u2019m not just talking about the \u2014 the front line type intelligence, but the OSS didn\u2019t exist until just about that time. And they had never, the people in the OSS were not what the British had trained for years and years as intelligence officers. We all learned fr \u2014 by \u2014 by doing. The \u2014 I had some contact with OSS people afte \u2014 on \u2014 well, on \u2014 actually still in Europe, but on the way home. They were going home at the same time, and I listened to some of their stories. They were dropped \u2014 one particular I remember, who was an artist, or at least that is what he \u2014 he faked. He was of Italian descent, a New Yorker who spoke Italian. He was dropped into Normandy and he sat around painting. He was \u2014 to the Germans he was an Italian painter visiting here, and was friendly right, to \u2014 Italy was a friendly country. And that\u2019s the way he collected intelligence. But he said he had absolutely no idea what he was doing when he first got in there. He got in by parachute, got \u2014 the French helped him \u2014 French underground helped him. And then he \u2014 he sat aro \u2014 he tha \u2014 he started painting and reporting and they had equipment to \u2014 to report. And he was around Normandy and the Sherbrooke(ph) peninsula doing this artwork. Course na \u2014 he brought nothing home. He all gave that to \u2014 to his French comrades there. But again, no Interview with Charles Stein \" June 8, 1999 experience. Everything was \u2014 whatever we did was done for the first time, on the U.S. side. And now, as I said, the British, of course, had been doing their in- intelligence work, collection of intelligence all over the world with the \u2014 with the colonies and all that. So \u2014 a-and in World War II, of course, they\u2019d been in the war for three years before we came in, or almost three years. That was wa-why I said that their \u2014 their intelligence was better, they were better organized. We were just learning, but we got there. We \u2014 just like everything else, I think, in the \u2014 1n the U.S. Army. That army had absolutely no experience, we came from all over the place. Nobody \u2014 there were no real soldiers at th \u2014 in 1941. By 1944 we did the \u2014 the biggest \u2014 biggest job ever done in any \u2014 any invasion. And it was successful. So I guess as Americans, we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re quick learners. We picked up an awful lot from the British. They were very helpful. They taught us then. The schools that I went to in \u2014 in London during that period were very informative, because we talked to people who had been there, who had been there, done that and told us how \u2014 how they did whatever we were doing later on. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s about \u2014 that\u2019s about it for \u2014 on that."

            "question": "\u2014 get undressed, right. What other kind of things did you improvise?",
            "answer": "Well, there are \u2014 there were \u2014 for example, the \u2014 the \u2014 what they didn\u2019t teach us, they taught us that e-every soldier has a soldbuch, but didn\u2019t tell us what to do with it. That is we picked up ourselves. I \u2014 I picked up the first one I looked at and I said, there it is. And I asked the man ha \u2014 you were up with \u2014 I told him, I didn\u2019t ask him, I told him, you were up from this and this regiment, or this \u2014 and they said yes. And before that you were something else. One of the things that we did was when \u2014 when time allowed, was engage in some small talk. Small talk about, well, you got your family back home, and that would open up suddenly, and then you lead into other things. I had some interesting interrogations. I had \u2014 and this is \u2014 this is one in a\u2014 in a\u20141na billion, probably. Had a prisoner, this \u2014 we were about \u2014 we were in Germany at the time. And he had very little information, but he was willing to talk. He said tha \u2014 actually, he deserted he told me. I\u2019m not sure that that was right, but it didn\u2019t matter. But I noticed in papers that he had on him that he was a medical student at the University of Vienna. And so I asked him a \u2014 whether he was \u2014 took anatomy from Professor Bernkopf(ph) Versowzer(ph) and his mouth opened and he se \u2014 di-di-ta-ba \u2014 how \u2014 but how did you know? I said, I\u2019m an intelligence officer, I know everything. And he just couldn\u2019t understand why, Interview with Charles Stein \" June 8, 1999 and then he started opening up and told me all kinds of things about what happened to his family and others. His mother-in-law was mentally incompetent and she was in \u2014 in Vienna in a place that was known to me, that was the insane asylum in Vienna, there was one big one. And she had been killed, and he told me that they were killing these \u2014 well, handicapped people, mentally handicapped. They didn\u2019t need them, so they killed them. And you know, he was mad and so he said he deserted. Well, took him a long time to desert. But th \u2014 it-1t\u2019s that kind of thing that \u2014 that those are interesting little things that happened. There were many of them, of the different nature. For example, in the Battle of the Bulge, the unit I was with was holding one of the \u2014 you know, the corners of \u2014 of the thing. We were not penetrated, but we \u2014 we \u2014 we went in there to hold it, and that was in the famous Battle of the Hiirtgen Forest. And there was a German lieutenant colonel in there with his troops, holding out. And we could \u2014 it\u2019s a dense forest and we just couldn't get him out. And one day one of \u2014 a couple of Germans came out with a white flag and said that they\u2019re currently \u2014 name I \u2014 I can\u2019t remember the name, but it was a rather, later on, well known in \u2014 in \u2014 in the history of the war. What was his name? Well, can\u2019t remember. Anyhow, so who was sent in to bring \u2014 yeah, he was sick. He was very sick and he wanted to surrender. And so who was sent in to bring him out, of course? The only one who spoke German. And in I went and I got him out Interview with Charles Stein _ June 8, 1999 and we had \u2014 the man had pneumonia very badly. But \u2014 and, you know, interrogating him at this point was really not necessary. There was nothing he could tell us in the \u2014 in the present situation. But he was on his own, just started talking as we carried him out. His own men carried him on a stretcher. And we came out of the forest and then we waited until he was evacuated. And he just told us all kinds of war stories, was just great. Good information. Not necessarily tactical information, but strategically important of how decisions were made and all that. Well, we took that down and got it back to higher headquarters and I don\u2019t know what they did with it, but at least the information was there. So these were the kind of things that you fell into occasionally."

Although, I\u2019m not sure that they were anywhere near any of the atrocities or anything like that. But the Waffen SS was a tough outfit, in the beginning. Not in the \u2014 t-towards the end of the war, they filled in the blanks in \u2014 in the \u2014 the blank spaces in those organizations with just about anybody, including, I think, I\u2019m not sure whether I told that \u2014 told you that story earlier about the boy, about a 17 year old kid who told me that he was an American. I said, oh yes? He said yes. He said, take off my Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Charles Stein me June 8, 1999 boot. Took off his boot, took out an innersole and came out with a green card with a baby\u2019s picture on it. His family had gone \u2014 had come to America and his parents were in \u2014 in Los Angeles. Yeah, came to America in the \u2014 sometime in the late 20\u2019s, early 30\u2019s, I guess. He was a baby then, and was a small \u2014 small \u2014 small child. They applied for a \u2014 they became permanent residents and probably, his parents later, citizens. But he was sent to his grandmother in Germany to go to school, they wanted him to go to school in Germany. Well, he did, he went back, and war broke out and when he got to be about 16 or so they pulled him in, this was towards the end of the war. And there he was in a Waffen SS uniform. That thing made the newspapers, by the way. I had \u2014 happened to have somebody when I \u2014 I called the thing in. I said \u2014 I said, ve got \u2014 I\u2019ve got an \u2014 an American Waffen SS guy here. And I told my G2 about that, and apparently there were some \u2014 I think Associated Press newsmen there, they wanted to see us. They say, hold him there, we \u2014 we\u2019 ll be right down. They took a picture. I still have a clipping at home of that and talking about Captain Stein talking to \u2014 to this kid, whose showing his \u2014 that he was an American. Well, he was still a prisoner of war in a \u2014 I guess we \u2014 we had to process him that way, cause he was a German soldier."

When we \u2014 when I talked to some people in \u2014 well, some Germans at that point, we were at the Czech border \u2014 no, that was afterward. We were still on the Elbe. And we had some communication with the Russians, who had come across many of the concentration camps in the east. And they were telling us what they had found. Millions of people killed and although we had interpreters, Russian interpreters, we had a meeting ta \u2014 even before V-E day, it \u2014 it was in late April, we were on the Elbe and we stopped, and the Germans stopped on the other side, that was agreed that we would \u2014 that Elbe was the \u2014 the \u2014 the border between the two zones. And we had arranged and I was invol \u2014 I was included in that with our general \u2014 meetings with the Russian general. We got together and we spent a couple of days of just talking through interpreters. And that 1s the first time that I really found out what had happened. And of course, my parents were on my mind, and not only my parents, the rest of my family, too. That\u2019s when the search began. Of course, after V-E day, I could not \u2014I wanted to go to Vienna. Figured that \u2014 I knew \u2014 I had known that my parents had been deported to L\u00e9dz, because in \u2014 it was two weeks after I went into the army in \u2014 in October \u00b041, I got a postcard that is \u2014 it came to New York and to my \u2014 the second cousin who lived in New York, or \u2014 was my \u2014 my address that I had. And he brought it to me and saying that a postcard had come saying that my Interview with Charles Stein \" June 8, 1999 parents were being deported in October of \u201941, to Litzmannstadt, Lodz, to the ghetto. That\u2019s the last information I had. After that, nothing. And so I wanted to go to Vienna, but the army wouldn\u2019t let me. As an intelligence officer, the Russians were in \u2014 had \u2014 had Vienna at the time and that part of Austria and they wouldn\u2019t let us go into the Russian zone. So at that point I decided Pll go home, to New York at that time. And by October \u2014 the war was over in March \u2014 1n \u2014 1n \u2014 excuse me, in May, May the ninth, excuse me. And we were \u2014 my team was pulled out in \u2014 in July and sent back to Paris where our headquarter \u2014 military intelligence headquarters was. First to \u2014 to another place in \u2014 in Germany and then to Paris. And we stayed there for shipment home. There were lots of things at that point, we could have signed up as a civilian to civil government and all the things that were going on, but I decided my best bet was to go home and start looking from \u2014 from that angle, and if necessary I\u2019d come back as a civilian and of course, I intended to get out of the army, which I did in 1945, and I was separated in \u2014 in the 14\" of December, 1945, and signed on as a reserve officer. I stayed on in the reserves."

            "answer": "Right. In early \u201946, I was considering both of these things. And in \u2014 I was accepted. I had written to and sent my \u2014 my papers to \u2014 o-of my previous studies to Basel(ph) and Zurich and I was accepted in both of them, provisionally, if space was available in later years. I was accepted for the first year, but for one year only Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 and depending on space available, whatever. And at the same time, I had \u2014 this was now early 1946, and I had talked to a lot \u2014 lot of people, you know, after returning and I found out how all these people made all this money, in all kinds of things. And I said maybe I ought to do \u2014 make a little money, I had none. I had whatever I had saved from my army pay, which wasn\u2019t very much. I wasn\u2019t working, I had not found a way to \u2014 to do anything and so I said why, why don\u2019t I do something else first? So I\u2014 I dropped Palestine and I dropped medicine and I went into the export business. Opened my own busin \u2014 I took \u2014 well, first of all I had to learn something about the export, and that was the big thing then that I \u2014 I found out. And I had to learn something about it. Fortunately 1-in the newspapers I found a two week course that would teach me all about it, and that\u2019s exactly what I did, I\u2014 I went \u2014 I mean, this is strictly an amateur performance at the time. I went and took a two week course and I knew all about it, I knew how to \u2014 what kind of documents you needed, and how \u2014 and all I needed now 1s to find out what I was going to sell and where. Well, I and a fr \u2014 a\u2014 a wartime buddy of mine, friend, we\u2019d been through the war together, and I, decided we\u2019d go into the export business, and we did. And we si \u2014 decided that the electrical appliances were a good thing, we \u2014 I guess we liked electrical appliances, so we went into that and we decided that we would do South America \u2014 Latin America as \u2014 as our target. That, we had read was good Interview with Charles Stein \u201c June 8, 1999 place to do, and we did. Went into business, we \u2014 we got in contact with some manufacturers of appliances, and we went to various embassies and asked for their importer \u2014 lists of importers, which was available. And we started writing let \u2014 by that time, by the way, I had taken, soon as it came back, I started taking a Spanish \u2014 I don\u2019t know why, but the G.I. bill was there and I didn't know what else to do with it until I went to medical school, which would have been \u2014 so I took Spanish and I was fairly fluent in Spanish by that time, it was now middle of 1946. By that time we \u2014 we got to the point where I n \u2014 I needed. And so I wrote up a catalog in Spanish, we put that up and a \u2014 a letter to all the customers and began working. Pretty soon we were making a little money, not very much. Not enough to live on, but there was still a G.I. bill that helped us out with that. And it lasted for \u2014 until early 1948. In early 1948 there was a sudden stop of dollars. The dollar was no longer available for payment to foreign countries, there was a shortage of d \u2014 of dollars, there was \u2014 there were \u2014 there were exchange restrictions. And so the big com-companies could give, you know, six months credit to \u2014 to compan \u2014 the little companies, like ours, we couldn\u2019t give any credit, we worked strictly as letter of credit. They sent a letter of credit in dollars to our bank and as soon as the ship \u2014 we could turn over the shipping documents, that the merchandise had been shipped, the bank would release the money. Well, that stopped, there were no more dollar Interview with Charles Stein oS June 8, 1999 letters of credit and so we went out of business. And then started an interesting period. I didn\u2019t know which way to turn, I \u2014 I\u2019d never even looked for a job, I didn\u2019t know how to look for \u2014 well, I\u2014 I knew how, but th-th-th \u2014 I didn\u2019t know what. I \u2014 so I went around and went to an employment office, one of those employment agencies and they said yeah, as a matter of fa \u2014 it was on 46\" Street and Fifth Avenue, I remember. And they said yeah, we have a job. There\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s a job opened right across the street here at a place called Nancy Studios, hat makers. Feather hats. You know, pasted feather on \u2014 on the thing. And \u2014 I mean, I \u2014 I found that out when I went to \u2014 to Nancy\u2019s. And so I went ik \u2014 went over there and they needed someone to run their office. Apparently whoever had the office had quit \u2014 was running the office had quit. So I went up there and there\u2019re two ladies running the shop and I said, here I am. They said oh yes, you\u2019ll do. We \u2014 you know, told them who I was and what I had done, I had my own business and all that. And they \u2014 they \u2014 they thought that was \u2014 that was good, so my major job was making up the payroll and invoices and making sure that money got to the bank and so forth. But the environment wasn\u2019t for me. This was a \u2014 a\u2014 the two ladies was Nancy and her sister were the designers of these hats. Their clientele was \u2014 were all name designers. Hattie Carnegie, Lily Dach\u00e9, a-all kind \u2014 you know, th-the \u2014 well known names in the fashion business, and they would Interview with Charles Stein a June 8, 1999 design special things for them, and others. Had about 20 or 30 women doing the work, so it was not a small place. But I started dealing with the clients and that\u2019s \u2014 it was something I couldn\u2019t take. I-It was a strange \u2014 you know, being called darling by these floating characters who were dressed in diff \u2014 1-1t was not \u2014 not my \u2014my cup of tea. But I worked, I \u2014 I had to make a living and I was looking around. And \u2014 and I worked there during the summer. I came home one day in September, it was September of \u201948, and I looked at my mail and there was a letter there from the Pentagon. I opened it up and it said, dear Captain Stein, we want you back. We have a special project here which 1s right in line with your experience during the war and please call this number. So I called the number in \u2014 in the \u2014 in Washington and talked to a major and he said \u2014 he told me what it was. It was in the office of the chief of military history, translating the experiences of the German general staff that apparently the United States had under contract of some sorts, in and out of jail in Germany, that were writing their heart out about their experiences on the eastern front in Russia. And I said that sounds interesting, yes, I\u2019m available. And in Novem \u2014 early November, starting in nove \u2014 as a matter of fact, the third of November, I \u2014 I came into Washington. Harry Truman and I came at th \u2014 came together. That was the day Harry Truman was elected. I came into Washington, back in uniform, and I was in the Pentagon, became chief of the Interview with Charles Stein _ June 8, 1999 translation section of milt \u2014 o-office of chief of military history and I spent the next three years there translating and \u2014 and writing. And by that time, of course, in 1950, summer of 1950 the Korean war broke out, and \u2014 \u201950 or \u201951 \u2014 yeah, *50. Well, I still had some \u2014 a year to go and \u2014 on my \u2014 my three yea \u2014 it was a three year appointment. And when the time was up, my time was up, I was told that nobody gets out, there\u2019s a war on. And I was told that I was \u2014 but I was told I was going to Germany, to the German side of our project. And two weeks later I got my orders saying report to San Francisco for shipment to Korea. And there I was, not exactly going to Germany. Well, I went to Korea, and went, checked in, was received by the officer in charge of \u2014 of that unit and \u2014 who said, do you speak \u2014 is it\u2014 you came here as a prisoner of war interrogator, which was one of my specialties. Oh, let me back up for a moment. While I was still in Washington, when I got my orders and I read this thing, that I \u2014 I was going over with the MOS, the specialty as a \u2014 as a prisoner of war interrogator, I went down to what we called Korean man \u2014 what was called Korean management, we called it Korean manglement, and was talking to some old colonel who\u2019d been there since world \u2014 since the Civil War, I think. Looked like it. And I said look, I have \u2014 you\u2019re sending me to Korea with a 93-16. I don\u2019t speak any of those languages. And he said, well, we didn\u2019t asked for no languages, they just said they wanted 93-16s. Interview with Charles Stein \u00b0 June 8, 1999 And I said, yes, sir. I knew there was nothing \u2014 yeah \u2014 well, I talked to this major and he said, do you speak Korean? I said nope. He said, Japanese? The Koreans in the \u2014 in the army at that time grew up under Japanese occupation, so most of them spoke \u2014 still spoke some Japanese, too. I said nope. He said, Chinese? I said, nope. He says, you\u2019re another one. I said, you mean you have more? He said yes. They\u2019ve been sending us 93-16s and we have \u2014 none of them speak Korean. Okay, they said, but never mind, we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll have an assignment for you. And I was assigned to eighth \u2014 eighth army headquarters and research and \u2014 and \u2014 yeah, and research, intelligence research. And later on, couple of months later I was reassigned as chief of the order of battle, a division of \u2014 of eighth army headquarters. But the experience there was again, this now is December, end of December 1951. Cold, ice cold, bad weather and all that, and the chief of intelligence, Colonel Bump(ph) when I reported in, I and two other reported in at the same time, said well, ve got an assignment for you, I want you to go up to the second infantry division up in the hills and observe the air support for our infantry, and Ill call you back when the time comes. So we sat up there for about three weeks in the foxholes, on top of these ridges, watching air support, getting shot at. We didn\u2019t do any shooting then, infantry did. Watching the patrols go out and all that. Anyhow, we got back three weeks later and came in and I was this \u2014 the Interview with Charles Stein a June 8, 1999 senior of the three of us and so I\u2014 I reported. We came in and we saluted and said, Colonel, we have a report for you on the \u2014 on the air support. We had put our notes together and whipped up a report. He said, oh, I don\u2019t want your report, I know all about what\u2019s going on up there. I just sent you up there because nobody works for me who doesn\u2019t get his feet wet. You know what the war is like, now you can start working on it. Was a good idea. Not for \u2014 for \u2014 not while we were up there. Okay, so we \u2014 | \u2014 then I \u2014I started working and th \u2014 stayed there for \u2014 until January of 1953, by which time I have had enough of the war and of the army and well, there \u2014 there happened to be a \u2014 a \u2014 there happened to be something that no \u2014 none of us knew. In the fall of 1952, all the reserve officers got a letter saying that your \u2014 th- the \u2014 you were extended, your \u2014 your fi \u2014 your army still had a five year dur \u2014 as \u2014 of reserve officers, five years at a time, you had to renew every five years. The other services had already changed to permanent. And so we did th \u2014 by executive order, ba \u2014 ba \u2014 the president, and when the Korean war broke out all reserve officers were frozen, they had to stay in the \u2014 a-all commissions were extended. But the law expired on the first of April 1953. So all of us who were in Korea in 1952 had to be home and out of the army by \u2014 by the first of April, and the army decided that they were going to get us out by January to give us a chance \u2014 to give us time to get back to the United States and get processed out. And so we got this Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Charles Stein \u201c June 8, 1999 letter saying we\u2019d like you to sign up for the permanent and you\u2019ll go on and all that. And statistics later on came out that said 66 percent of all the reserve officers said thank you but no thank you, including myself. And then in December of 1952, I happened to be \u2014 I still had an R and R leave, five days in \u2014 in Tokyo, I flew over to Tokyo, and I ran into some old friends of mine and one of them said, wa \u2014 when you \u2014 where you going? I said well, I\u2019m going home in January. By the end of January I should be on the way home. And he said, what are you going to do? And I said I have no idea. I have no place to go, I have no \u2014 no \u2014 no connections anywhere. So I'll just go home and I'll \u2014 Il find something. Well, in the \u2014 he said, the \u2014 oh, this \u2014 this friend said, well hey, ve got a job for you, a civilian job here in Tokyo. I\u2019m heading up a new office in \u2014 on the first of January. There\u2019s a new command being formed, the United Nations and far e \u2014 and Far East command, a combined command and I\u2019m head of the intelligence policy division and I have one civilian slot, a senior civilian and you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re it, 1f you want it. So I went down to personnel and they explained what it was, and they explained to me what it \u2014 what it pays and it paid more than a captain. And all the perks with it and I said yeah, why not. And I signed up right there and they say yeah, you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re qu \u2014 I told them \u2014 I had to write up what I was doing and for \u2014 fill out a form.

And so there I was, and I stayed on in Tokyo as a civilian Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Charles Stein \u201d June 8, 1999 intelligence officer until 1955, when I returned home.

We \u2014 we also searched documents that \u2014 captured documents that we had here \u2014 in connection with that. And we were looking at the same documents and they were working on background for the trials that were still going on, and so we had close contact and we followed that all \u2014 followed that all the way. There were not enough that were punished."

No, no, I guess not, didn\u2019t have a television then. I \u2014 I was \u2014 I was listening and on the radio and I was \u2014 kept keeping a \u2014 a pad. And when the final vote was tallied \u2014 again, this of course now is 1950 \u2014 1947. I was Interview with Charles Stein * June 8, 1999 thinking of still again going to Palestine. But there were many things that \u2014 that held me back, you know, personal things that were happening and I \u2014 it was always, you know, next week, Ill think about it next week or I'll \u2014 Pll look into it next week. By that time I had taken up \u2014 I had contact with my cousin ha \u2014 at \u2014 and meanwhile his mother and father, who had gotten away out of Vienna to England, his father was \u2014 came out of Dachau, they released him. Mother had gotten a permit to go to England, and so they went to England, some went to Palestine. And I had seen them in England when I was in England. They had gone to Palestine so a \u2014 a\u2014 we had correspondence then, and I thought that I might join them, but I didn\u2019t until many years later when I did go over and I\u2019ve been there quite a few times now."

We \u2014 we were fighting \u2014 we \u2014 we were fighting a war, but we weren\u2019t. I see the same thing going on right today in \u2014 1n Kosovo, where we \u2014 we\u2019re talking about fighting a war, we\u2019re fighting something. We\u2019re not going in and cleaning it up, and that\u2019s what happened.

There we didn't fight to win, we fought to \u2014 to sit around and let somebody do the talking. And so now I \u2014 I-I did not think kindly of what was happening there."

            "answer": "The Cold War, of course that was somehow predictable, that having met the Russians, we knew we weren\u2019t going to be friends, although we were friendly and the vodka flowed freely, but that was not it, and then of course when the Russians dug in and said \u2014 and dictated to us practically what \u2014 what we \u2014 what we could do and what we couldn\u2019t do, that was pretty much the beginning of the Cold War, and Churchill saw it and \u2014 and it happened.

            "answer": "Left Tokyo and came to Washington after cruising around the United States for about oh, a good two or three months. We landed in Seattle where Barbara has an aunt and cousins and we stopped there for a few days. Then went to San Francisco where she has another aunt, we visited there and I got introduced to the family. And then we went to Iowa, to Webster City, Iowa, a great metropolis of about 8,000 people and I met the parents. Parents knew who I was, I had written to them. As a matter of fact, just very recently I went through some papers that when \u2014 her mother died some years ago, but we had never looked through that file of Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Charles Stein *\u00b0 June 8, 1999 papers that \u2014 that we had taken from her, and I looked through some paper and there was the letter I wrote to them when I first met Barbara \u2014 or wh-when we decided to get married, and I wrote to them and told them who I was, and got to \u2014 to Webster City and well, had parties and met \u2014 met the whole town. And stayed there for awhile and then went to Washington. In Washington I was then for the first and only time \u2014 no, I ca \u2014 I \u2014 was not the first and only time, my first job in \u2014 in New York was, course, I had to look for a job. But coming to Washington was the first time that I really had to \u2014 really had to look for a job. There was no \u2014 no HIAS to \u2014 to help me out. And I had a \u2014 well, in \u2014 while I was in \u2014 in Tokyo, in \u2014 in \u2014 in my capacity as \u2014 in my job, I had very close contacts with the CIA people out there. And so before I left the chief of the CIA group asked \u2014 said, why don\u2019t you \u2014 when you get home, why don\u2019t you just stop in and talk to the people in Langley and come with us? And I said, well, that\u2019s nice and he gave me a letter of recommendation. And so I did and they offered me something that was not for me, they \u2014 they offered me a job in \u2014 in \u2014 a\u2014a temporary job in Germany and I wasn\u2019t ready to go out \u2014 out again, I wanted to stay awhile. And so I didn\u2019t take that. And then again, by continuous luck, ran into a friend who said, well oh, I know of a new outfit that they\u2019re forming at the \u2014 in the Pentagon and I\u2019ve applied for it. He was working somewhere in the Pentagon. He said, to transfer into it and they\u2019ve got Interview with Charles Stein \u201d June 8, 1999 slots open, why don\u2019t you try that? And I tried it and I got the job, became his boss. John has never forgiven me that, but we\u2019re still friends. And there I\u2014I got the job with Air Force Intelligence and worked with them for oh, several years. Got several promotions, I was doing well. Then our organization was taken over into the Defense Intelligence Agency when that was formed, and that took in units from all the military agencies. Stayed with them from \u201962, I was involved in \u2014 in the creation of the new organization, was on that committee, and stayed with them until \u00b065 when once again I was invited by the State Department to transfer to the State Department. It happened during a \u2014 a meeting. I was presenting a project that we had \u2014 a worldwide project of intelligence handling that we had, I was involved with through an inter \u2014 through an interagency committee. The State Department representative said, would you be interested in coming to our \u2014 we have nothing like that. And I said, well, make me an offer I can\u2019t resist. And he said the \u2014 about two weeks later, he made me that offer. And I transferred to the State Department in the foreign service and became a foreign service officer, coming in on top, which, much to the \u2014 1n the foreign service that \u2014 yo-you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re not liked if you come in on top because everybody else came in on the bottom.

This is tape two, side A, and you had been telling me about your changes in your professional life with the Air Force Intelligence and Defense Intelligence and then the State Department. Could you walk me through some of those jobs and what your role was, your duties, responsibilities?",
            "answer": "Yeah. In \u2014 I \u2014 I mentioned that this was a new project that my friend told me about in the Air Force Intelligence. What happened was the air force was the, in 1955 was getting into the \u2014 the technological age of information processing. They were the leaders in the thing. They had come up with a project that was worked up with IBM and Eastman-Kodak, a combined project of information processing where the information, that is documents, would be photographed on microfilm, and at the same time, there would be an encoding placed on the microfilm and the coding was then read electronically from the film, and would \u2014 and when you \u2014 when you got the right \u2014 right thing, looking for a specific document that contained a subject matter, th-the subject matter was coded. And that was on there, and that would \u2014 that then would print out the document that pertained to whatever you were looking for. That was a \u2014 a new way of doing it, you didn\u2019t have to have any Interview with Charles Stein \u201d June 8, 1999 \u2014 any input, typewriter input that you had until that time. We had to type punch cards and whatever, or type it into the computer and then it would come \u2014 you \u2014 th \u2014 this way you could just photograph it. Well, it was a novel thing, and that is what they \u2014 they were hiring people to do that. My job, I became a \u2014 I was hired as the chief of the coding section, and I worked with the tech \u2014 technical part, the \u2014 the contractors on what they were doing and to make sure that we\u2019re do \u2014 and we developed \u2014 and again, we did this with the CIA, a\u2014 a code \u2014 a code dictionary, sort of. An intelligence code, that for everything that was of interest to intelligence, would have a code number. And then we would have \u2014 this was my section then, readers read the documents that were coming in, intelligence documents, reports from all over the world, and numerically code what was in that document. That document would then be photographed with the code input also onto the film, and it was available for \u2014 for retrieval. We had gotten that thing, it took a number of years to \u2014 to do this, we worked from \u201955 to about \u2014 by \u201958 or 59 we had the first installation, and it worked. We then expanded that to the rest of the air force, and I went out to help the installation of the thing at \u2014- in Omaha at the Strategic Air Command. And in Ohio at the Air Force Research and Development command and several other places, and we started sending out copies of what we had made the film into those. And those were little chips, photo chips that ran through just \u2014 Interview with Charles Stein \u201c June 8, 1999 similar to \u2014 to punch cards running through when you\u2019re searching, but these were photo chips and when you got a hit it would extract it and make a full copy of it. Or you could view it on a\u2014 on a microfilm viewer. That was the main project. Now, it \u2014 we got into \u2014 more into different arrangements. That unit then was taken over with a lot of the other air force intelligence into the Defense Intelligence Agency when that was established. And I was still in charge of that, but I was working on new developments, now we were into computer information, handling a computer. It was all intelligence handling. I was not, at that point any more directly involved with the intelligence, but with the technical operation. And it was that, and DIA just a follow on to the same thing. And it was that thing that State Department got interested in. And when I got into State Department, again, they formed a separate unit to start an information processing operation in the State Department, they didn\u2019t have any. As I found out later, they didn\u2019t want any. The foreign service offices, they didn\u2019t want to have information. He wanted to have what he had, his pieces of paper and he\u2019d make up his own mind, they didn\u2019t want anybody else to \u2014 to shove stuff at him that he didn\u2019t see \u2014 had seen \u2014 hadn\u2019t seen before, to change his mind possibly. Anyhow, that was an \u2014 that\u2019s an interpretation. But I got to the State Department and we started, there were about four or five of us that had been \u2014 some from the State Department and a couple of people from CIA, myself from the Interview with Charles Stein * June 8, 1999 IAA, and one from USIA, and there was one other \u2014 a couple from the State Department, and we all sat and we started looking at what is it that the foreign service \u2014 tha-that the State Department needs in the \u2014 getting information. Where do they get their information from and how could we put this into a system? In other words, we were systems development. And we then got money through a \u2014 probably my most grueling and demeaning experience in my life. I had to testify before Congress, before a congressional committee. It \u2014 the man, my immediate superior in that particular thing, was lost. He and I were sitting there, I was in the left hand seat. The left hand seat 1s the \u2014 when you\u2019re facing the committee is the \u2014 the secondary. I was the one with the information, he was the one that answered the questions. And a certain congressman from Brooklyn destroyed my buddy. The man was so confused he didn\u2019t know what to say and the chairman of the committee excused him and said at this point you\u2019re not answering any more questions, but your sidekick answers the questions, so let him answer it and you\u2019re excused, and he wal \u2014 had to leave the \u2014 the committee room. I sat there for the rest of it and I got through it and I got the money. So \u2014 however, was an interesting thing. I was noticing that the chairman\u2019s assistants, the \u2014 not a congressman, one of \u2014 his \u2014 his office manager, wi \u2014 whoever he was, had an interesting head movement. And being a good observer, I had noticed that when they asked first Interview with Charles Stein \u201c June 8, 1999 questions and I was watching that, and I noticed that when he expected a positive answer to something, his head would go this way. And when the congressman asked a trick question, the guy went this way. So my eye was on him, and I got through the thing, it worked. I was right, that that was the way, that he knew \u2014 these people know the answers. When they ask a question they know the answer. And so \u2014 they want confirmation of their knowledge, and well anyhow, it \u2014 that \u2014 that was \u2014 1t was \u2014 it was a sad thing. I came out and poor guy outside, I asked him to go home. He wanted to go back to the office, I said, you should go home. [Il call you later, I'll tell you what happened. He said, but di-di \u2014 do you know what \u2014 I said, yeah, we got the money, we\u2019re all \u2014 you\u2019re all right, go home. He went home and I called him later on and he had calmed down, and he said, he-hell, I \u2014 I can\u2019t even remember what happened. And very shortly after that he left the State Department, you know, fortunately there was some higher up sitting in the back listening to this thing and they weren\u2019t happy with him, so anyhow. Well, we got the money and we had the department hire contractors, some of these big information processing firms. They came in and they started working on a program. The program was, oh about half way through, and we got more money, because we showed that it was good. This time we didn\u2019t have to testify any more, 1t was done in the higher-ups. And they \u2014 let\u2019s see, after about \u2014 it was about two and a half Interview with Charles Stein \u201c June 8, 1999 years into the \u2014 into the program, that there was an internal thing. Again, there\u2019s a political thing. The assistant Secretary of State I worked for and another assistant Secretary of State, who wanted that unit, the other one, th-the \u2014 the enemy there, the other one was the assistant secretary for administration, who had the computer operation of the State Department, the payroll, in other words. Payroll and personnel and whatever, but never anything subst \u2014 substance \u2014 substantive 1n- information, they\u2019d never handle it. But they saw something that hadn\u2019t \u2014 that got money and all kinds of possible \u2014 and they wanted it. Well, it was a time when my assistant secretary wanted another job. He wanted to be a \u2014 what do they call that? A diplomat in residence at the university. We had \u2014 the university, they have a diplomat in residence, that a \u2014 that\u2019s a cream puff, absolutely. And usually that led to an ambassadorship. People who were s \u2014 who were selected for that. Well, he was pretty close to that, he wanted an ambassadorship eventually, and he want \u2014 but there was a job that he could have had, but they kept him because he had things going on in his o-operation that were not finished, they wouldn\u2019t let him go. So he changed. He sold us a \u2014 he sold my \u2014 my organization to administration. And I said, I\u2019m not available for that. You can transfer it, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m out. I\u2014 I wouldn\u2019t work for those people, I \u2014 well, I knew them, I had worked with them before. Well, he was friendly enough to say \u2014 he was Jewish, by the way, the only other Jew in Interview with Charles Stein \u00b0 June 8, 1999 the area. And he said, I didn\u2019t think you would, but I\u2019ve got another job for you, if you want it. We have a new inspector general and I\u2019ve told him about how you go about doing your investigations and how you can do these things and \u2014 and he\u2019s interested in you, because you\u2019ve reviewed, you know what this whole department is doing, you\u2019ve done a survey to \u2014 to find out what they need, and he wants to talk to you. And he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s brand new, he just came an \u2014 an ambassador who just came back and got the job as Inspector General. So I made an appointment, went to see him and he said, yeah, I want you. And I became a senior foreign service inspector. Now again, I shifted jobs without try \u2014 even trying, you know, I \u2014 I\u2014 I was asked to. And when I got into the Inspector General\u2019s office, that I hadn\u2019t used before, cause they were not in the substantive area, I found that I was in \u2014 in very good company, because most of the senior inspectors were former ambassadors for whom there was no other assignment, there was a limited assignment. And so they became inspectors and they traveled around from one embassy to the other, to make sure that everything was all right, and they were doing, you know, reviewing the embassies, mainly. The idea I came up with, that sold m \u2014 sold me to \u2014 to the inspection corps was that there ma \u2014 are many things that are overlapping that are not being looked at in Washington, th-the various bureaus, each one working as an independent thing, each one working with all the embassies that their \u2014 you know, Interview with Charles Stein \"\u00b0 June 8, 1999 the European bureaus, working with all the European embassies, but there\u2019s no \u2014 no connection between them. They\u2019re doing all kind \u2014 I said, I would like to look into that. He said that\u2019s a great idea, you got it. So I started out on that and I became \u2014 I was doing \u2014 what\u2019d we call that? Well, the organizational reviews. And I did some of those. As I went on, I did all the \u2014 the bureaus, and particularly those that covered in substance more than an embassy. The scientific bureau \u2014 scientific and \u2014 and technical bureau, for example, had these technical attach\u00e9s out there that weren\u2019t talking to each other. So, there \u2014 it was a question of \u2014 of getting information to them and \u2014 I mean, getting information between them and not just reporting back to the bureau and the thing gets lost in the bureau. And the consular offices, for \u2014 of course, there are consulates in every country and more than there are embassies, and they\u2019re not talking to each other. They\u2019re reporting 1n, it\u2019s all a one way flow, nothing goes out \u2014 oh, excuse me \u2014 to \u2014 to all the others. And so I started working on that and I usually got a couple of other officers assigned to me, some of the junior officers that were also working with the inspectors and we sat down and we ju \u2014 started interviewing and looking into the records and all that, we find out how things were and sort of rewrote the \u2014 the \u2014 the job descriptions. The \u2014 the job [indecipherable]. I had one particular one that was of great interest to me, having been a refugee once, and that was, I came across, while I was looking at Interview with Charles Stein 7 June 8, 1999 these various organizations in the department of a special assistant to the Secretary of State for Refugee Affairs. When I looked into that I found that the man was a political appointee. He\u2019d made big contributions to somebody and he had a few people in Washington, but his work was being done in Geneva at the U.S. mission to the United Nations. In the process I also found that there was a special assistant to the Secretary of State for international Red Cross affairs. Now here we have the international Red Cross, a British a \u2014 a Swiss organization, and they have a one man office with one secretary who\u2019s a special assistant and who handles contacts with that. But the international Red Cross is in Geneva and who handles the \u2014 the br \u2014 the work? The office in Geneva. And this 1s a large office in the united na \u2014 in the mission to the United Nations. The U.S. mission. And I found a third one, a-a- another special assistant for a humanitar \u2014 for \u2014 not for humanitarian, for disaster relief affairs. Again, all of them political appointees. Well, I went \u2014 so I went to Geneva and talked to the people there and looked and see what they were doing and they were hardworking people. They were doing the budgeting for \u2014 for these various operations. They were representing the U.S. before the United Nations and before all the various organizations that physically handled refugees and disasters and so forth. And I came back and I wrote a \u2014 oh, about a 200 page report. This was about a six months affair. I wrote a rit \u2014 I wrote a report and I said, reorganize Interview with Charles Stein \u201d June 8, 1999 the whole thing and my s \u2014 my recommendation was that \u2014 to get another position as an assistant Secretary of Affairs for Humanitarian affairs, all this comes under that subject heading and abolish these special assistants. Have Geneva do the work and have Washington have a \u2014 a regular office doing whatever is necessary in the United States, such as you know, budget \u2014 getting \u2014 getting money and so forth. And that was finished in 1990 \u2014 in January of 19 four \u2014 four \u2014 1974, I finished that particular report. And then I went on and was doing \u2014 I think the next one was consular affairs and I was just about finished with consular affairs when one day I get a phone call from the refugee office. The deputy to this political appointee was a regular foreign service officer whom I knew, I had contact with. And he calls me and he said, I have a problem. We\u2019ve seen your report and I think it\u2019s great. They thought they were getting to be the assistant secretary job. They were \u2014 they were the biggest one, of course. Anyhow, we tha \u2014 we thought we \u2014 we have a \u2014 we have a problem, our man in Geneva, our \u2014 the head of the office just informed us that he is retiring in August. This is about the fifth \u2014 I think it was the day after the Fourth of July weekend, I\u2019d just come back. And he said, you\u2019re the only one who knows what\u2019s going on out there. How would you like to go to Geneva? And my answer to that, and I remember that to this day and will always remember it, was don\u2019t bother me with details, send five tickets. We had a meeting after that, he explained Interview with Charles Stein \u201d June 8, 1999 to me what this problem was and I said yes, Ill \u2014 PIl\u2014I\u2019ll accept and Ill go. And six weeks later we were in Geneva and I was running that office. And I\u2019d gotten, of course, I was at the time \u2014 this \u2014 the main job of that particular office really, was handling the Russian refugees that were coming out by about 20 or 30,000 a year. That was the beginning of the \u2014 the major exodus from Russia. What they were doing, and I was doing for the next four years was dealing with the voluntary agencies, HIAS, Tolstoy Foundation, the International Catholic Migration Commission, the World Council of Churches and many others. The \u2014 the Polish American refugee, or Czech American. All of those, all over Europe. They \u2014 tho \u2014 they were physically receiving these refugees, most of them, of course, Jews. All of them, probably. And were trying to resettle them in Israel, in the U.S., in Australia, wherever. And my job was to make sure that the U.S. money that went to these agencies for handling that, was properly used, that they were doing their job, and make sure that they were doing what they were supposed to do in the resettlement process. And I learned a lot about Russians during that period, and others, but mainly the Russians. Went to one of my jobs and the family was in Geneva, the kids were in international schools, which was a good experience for them, and my job was making \u2014 reviewing the budgets, reviewing their budget requests and changing them where it was necessary. They were all inflated, of Interview with Charles Stein * June 8, 1999 course, the usual thing. I was the first \u2014 first stop. And \u2014 and actually, physically looking at them, periodically. So every month I would be in one or \u2014 or two, I\u2019d be in \u2014 in \u2014in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and I\u2019d be in \u2014 in\u2014 in Munich, where many of them were. In Rome, which were the main parts and occasionally in Moscow and then Bucharest, behind the Iron Curtain then, talking to our people. And Turkey is \u2014 it was another place. Italy. Several places in Italy where they \u2014 these people were, and working with them to expedite the process. I had one critical, really critical thing. That was, the Kurds in Iran, Iran would not let them out and it was a long process and finally they wouldn\u2019t let any \u2014 finally they decide that yes, they could leave and so we would \u2014 wanted to send in a plane and they wouldn\u2019t allow us. And the international Red Cross, I involved them in it, and the international Red Cross was going to send in a plane and they wouldn\u2019t let them. And finally there was a\u2014acharter from \u2014 Lufthansa had a charter service and the international Red Cross managed to get one of their planes, and they gave in. Now, these people were to be brought out, the \u2014 they \u2014 ere \u2014 ira \u2014 ara \u2014 Iranians gave in and let them go. The people \u2014 the \u2014 the law, there was a special law that Congress enacted to let these people into the United States but it expired on a certain date, which was about \u2014 we were one day away from that date when the thing \u2014 when the Iranians gave in and the Red Cross took the plane over, got the people up and got them to Interview with Charles Stein * June 8, 1999 Frankfurt. I went to Frankfurt to work with our consulate to make sure that these people get their visas. It was just \u2014 they had to get their passports stamped. That was it. What ha \u2014 when they got to the United States was unimportant, but before that date \u2014 oh, this was the day. I get to \u2014 to Frankfurt and they\u2019re processing it, doing a good job, and they still got about a \u2014 about a hundred people at five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, the consul \u2014 the U.S. consul says well, we\u2019re gonna have to continue that tomorrow, we\u2019re going home. I said no, you\u2019re not. He said well, yeah, but you know, the day is over. I said, the law expires at midnight and as far as I\u2019m concerned it\u2019s midnight in Washington, not in Frankfurt. And it is five o\u2019clock and it\u2019s noon, we got 12 hours to go, you\u2019ve got to finish these people. He says no, I can\u2019t do that. I said, I want a line to the assistant secretary for consular affairs, whom I knew well. I had done a job for her before I left and we had good \u2014 good relationship. And he got \u2014 he says okay, so he got the line through. He couldn\u2019t refuse me, so he got the line. And I talked to the lady and I said, I\u2019ve got a reluctant [indecipherable] I\u2019m \u2014 we\u2019re doing the Kurds, and she said yeah, yeah, how you doing? I said we \u2014 there\u2019s still about a hundred left that have not, and \u2014 been visa\u2019d and your man here wants to go home, he wants to close up. She said, let me have him. I said \u2014 handed him the telephone and I notice his face getting longer and longer and he hung up and he said okay, we\u2019ll work until it\u2019s finished. Interview with Charles Stein ~ June 8, 1999 Well, by about 10 o\u2019clock that night we were finished. Everybody had their visa, stamped with today\u2019s date \u2014 with that day\u2019s date and the next day we got them on a plane and sent them to the U.S. But those are the kind of things that you \u2014 the troubleshooting type things that \u2014 that you had to do every once in awhile. Had to intervene in Rome with the Russians. The Russians in \u2014 in \u2014 in Rome were treated very nice, they had them out on the \u2014 on the li \u2014 li \u2014 just like they have in New York, in Brighton Beach, they all live out there. In Rome they had them out on the \u2014 on \u2014 near the Lido someplace \u2014 not Lido, whatever the beach 1s. Nicely quartered. Then you came into town to \u2014 and HIAS was handling most of the Russians in th\u2014 Rome. And they walked in and he said \u2014 and their \u2014 their \u2014 their questions were, where is my money, where is my house, where is my servants, where is my wi \u2014 the Russian way. The Russians were used to asking for some \u2014 the government. The government gave them. They were still in that mode. And we had some serious problems there, the people were intimidated by them. And I told them, don\u2019t be intimidated, you\u2019ve got \u2014 they had Russian speakers there, and they were \u2014 I \u2014I \u2014I told them how \u2014 how to talk to these people. Just yell at them. Tell them to go away, they get nothing. One more word out of you and you\u2019re out, you get nothing, you go wherever you want to go. And it \u2014 it worked. It worked, you know. Again, something they were used to. The KGB wasn\u2019t going to be \u2014 talk to Interview with Charles Stein ~ June 8, 1999 them friendly like, so we weren\u2019t either. They had something coming to them. We told them that no, you don\u2019t have anything coming to you, we\u2019re giving it to you because we\u2019re good people. And in that particular case, and there were a lot of them there, the word got to all of them, I was the United States government. I represent \u2014 see, those were just an organization. When I came, I was the United States government. Well that \u2014 that made \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 that did it. When the government says you gotta be quiet, you\u2019re quiet. So we\u2019re \u2014 you know, it was game playing, but \u2014 1t was \u2014 it was acting. I did not go to Hollywood after that. That\u2019s \u2014 you know, experiences like that, that was \u2014 that was my job. And of course I saw a lot of misery too, people coming out and having to sit in those camps in some areas, they were not too pleasant. Some intellectuals, people with \u2014 who had status and \u2014 and now were begging, in effect. I felt for them, but on the other hand, I was there too, once, and I knew how they felt. So, you know, you treated them accordingly. You talked to them, and particularly in some cases when I talked to them, I told them who I was, and I said, I was in your position once, and look at me now. It\u2019s gonna happen to you, just take it easy. It\u2019Il be done. We\u2019re doing it, but it takes time. And it helped a little, some cases, I \u2014 I hope it did."

            "question": "The 1960\u2019s were very turbulent years in this country, a lot of changes. I\u2019d like you to reflect back on some of the things from the 60\u2019s, like the \u2014 the Vietnam war an-and Civil Rights, and Women\u2019s Movement. Did you get involved with any of those, or are any of those of particular interest to you?",
            "answer": "No, I was \u2014 well, put this way. In 1965 \u2014 no, \u201966, I\u2019d just gone to the State Department. No, no, no, fift \u2014 \u201965, I was still with the DIA. I received a letter from the army, saying that the Secretary of Defense has declared your job an essential \u2014 a civilian essential position. Therefore, you can no longer remain in the active reserve. I was still a reserve officer. By that time I was a lieutenant colonel. And I \u2014 Interview with Charles Stein * June 8, 1999 i\u20141-\u2014 well, let me just quickly here, when I said I left Korea and we said no thank you, we don\u2019t. When I got back to Washington I applied for commission again. I decided I \u2014 I want to stay in, mainly because it \u2014 that pays, at the end. I had never known until 1957, approximately \u201957 1s when I came back in, that reserve offices who had active duty at age 60 would get money. And I said well, why not? Somebody talked me into it, really. Somebody told me about that, one of the people I wor \u2014 I worked with. They said, why don\u2019t you come back in, and I went down to Fort Myer(ph) and said, can I come back in? And they said, of course. And I \u2014 I came \u2014 I-I was reassigned on the non-pay unit. We met once every two weeks in the Pentagon for a couple of hours, get a lecture from somebody or gave a lecture. And that was it, we got points, that\u2019s all. So anyhow, in 1965 I got this letter saying that your \u2014 you\u2019re essential now and you can\u2019t be in the reserves any more, in the active reserve, but you have over 20 years, and so you have a choice to go in the inactive reserve or into retired reserve. And Vietnam was just brewing and I said, I don\u2019t want to get caught in another war. Even \u2014 even then I might \u2014 this \u2014 this thing ad \u2014 ba \u2014 my civilian job might end, and I\u2019ve had two wars, two is enough. And Vietnam didn\u2019t look like anything that I should get involved in. And I said \u2014 I wrote back and said no, put me in the \u2014 1n the retired reserve and I retired at that point. And at age 60, the checks started coming, which are still accepted. But Interview with Charles Stein *\u00b0 June 8, 1999 anyhow, now Vietnam I did not like what was going on. I couldn\u2019t see it. There was \u2014 I didn\u2019t think we had any business there. And I had friends who were still in the service who went over there and they came back and they told me what conditions they \u2014 that they had, under what conditions they were there, and it was not what I \u2014 I felt that I was right, we shouldn\u2019t be there. And I had \u2014 I felt for all the people that \u2014 that were against the war and all that, although you know, I was sort of a military something or other, nothing serious. But that wasn\u2019t it and many of the people I knew who were in the military and in the reserves and retired in the reserves all felt like I did, so I-I wasn\u2019t alone. And I \u2014 I \u2014 well, we were right, it came out the wrong way at the end."

I almost got involved directly in \u2014 well, I did get involved in a way, in the Yom Kippur war in \u201973. I was at the synagogue in \u201973 on Yom Kippur, when the thing \u2014 th-the news came. I remember it was in a Sunday, I believe. And I had airline tickets to Israel for Monday. On \u2014 as a job, I was supposed to \u2014 I was still an inspector then, and I was to inspect the immigration policies of Israel, again ka \u2014 that was still during the \u2014 the time when I was working on the \u2014 on the refugee and the humanitarian affairs study.

I did get there again, oh, about the following month. It was an interesting thing, I had to go to \u2014 to Jordan and there was a \u2014 when I got to Israel I said, well, I\u2019m going to have to go back to Greece and then fly into Jordan. And they said no. Said the Allenby bridge, which is the famous bridge where the crossings occurred, the \u2014 the exchanges and all that. They said, we have a deal with \u2014 Israel really has a deal with Jordan, war or no war. We can get you to the bridge, and on \u2014 it was a certain day, like Tuesday or Wednesday, but the \u2014 one of the officers from \u2014 from Amman is coming to Jerusalem across the bridge, and he \u2014 the embassy will take him in their car to the bridge. They will cross \u2014 he will have to walk across the bridge and we have a car at the bridge to pick him up. So we\u2019ll just tell the embassy in \u2014 we\u2019ll just call Jordan, Amman, and we\u2019 ll tell them that you\u2019ll be crossing the bridge at the same time, you\u2019ll be in the car that \u2014 pick him up and they co \u2014 they\u2019ll pick you up on the other side. You\u2019re just gonna have to carry a suitcase by yourself across. I said, well that\u2019s no problem. And so that\u2019s how we went a \u2014 went across that bridge. And it was interesting, I got a trip through all of the \u2014 the territories there, Interview with Charles Stein .\" June 8, 1999 the new territories. Well, they weren\u2019t new any more. But anyhow, got there, got to the bridge, went across. Said hello to the guy who ca \u2014 came in from \u2014 from Jordan. Went across and got in the car and got to the embassy in Jordan. And from there I could go to Lebanon and finished up my trip and then went home. So that was an interesting experience.

There\u2019s a lot of bookkeeping \u2014 well, a lot of 1t was ha-handling the \u2014 well, okay, th - my \u2014 my duties were representation to the United Nations, to the appropriate offices of the Interview with Charles Stein \" June 8, 1999 United Nations, the high commissioner for refugees, the U.N. high commissioner for disaster relief, the international Red Cross and all the other international organizations that had any dealings with \u2014 with refugees or dis \u2014 or any of the human \u2014 humanitarian affairs, including the human rights. I had one officer assigned to me who was specially doing human rights work. I concentrated on directing the United States refugee program, as it was called, and my job was to see that the U.S. funds that were going into the program were being properly used by the people who were actually operating the program. And now those people were voluntary agencies, as we called them. HIAS, International Catholic Migration Commission, World Council of Churches, Polish American, Czech American refugee organizations, Tolstoy Foundation, in \u2014 in \u2014 International Rescue Committee and others. They had places in various parts of Europe, where they would receive the refugees, they would come m \u2014 and those \u2014 this is the period when we had the Russian refugees coming out. They were coming out between 20 and 30,000 a year in those years. They would house them, feed them and process them and help them get to their final destination.

Others stayed in Europe or some in Germany, and various other places. But with all these people there was Interview with Charles Stein \u00b0* June 8, 1999 the need \u2014 the \u2014 needed money, and the United States supported that. We also supported Israel in the settling of the Russian refugees. We supplied money for the building of housing and teaching them language, teaching and whatever was necessary to ink \u2014 to get them into \u2014 into the main stream. So my job took me to \u2014 to these \u2014 to various places where the \u2014 where the people were being actually processed.

We had all the \u2014 all these organizations also had their own funds, but you had to watch them, of course, you know, money \u2014 money is available so you use it any way you \u2014 you feel like it until somebody looks over your shoulder. Also, I had to look at their \u2014 their annual budgets when they \u2014 their budgets would come to me, I would check it to see if it was justified and then pass it on to Washington to present to Congress. I made the first corrections and then Washington cut some more, and whatever. These \u2014 these things happened, of course, it\u2019s the usual with the budget process. But the \u2014 the best part of that was I traveled and I \u2014 I saw a lot of these people and my points of travel were what \u2014 Paris, Rome, Vienna, all hardship points \u2014 ports. Munich was a very heavy place, lots \u2014 many of them came through Munich because many of the organizations had their headquarters in Munich for some reason or other. Some came through Frankfurt. And occasionally I would go \u2014 Istanbul was another Interview with Charles Stein \u201c June 8, 1999 one, and occasionally I would go to \u2014 to Bucharest and to Moscow, because \u2014 to talk \u2014 to work with our own people, the embassy people, to find out what the governments are up to and how they are handling \u2014 because they were handling some of the guarantees to the local government that they would be going to the United States and once they got out we tried to get them to \u2014 to Israel. But anyhow, most of that, 1t was \u2014 was a very interesting job. And having been a refugee once, I \u2014 I could \u2014 I knew what these people were going through, and wherever we could help, I \u2014 I helped."

            "answer": "Four years. I was there for exactly four years. My family was with me and the children went to an international school in \u2014 in Geneva. And it was \u2014 it \u2014 1t \u2014 it was a dream assignment. I had planned on retiring, I wanted to stay another year, and so I asked \u2014 I put in a request for \u2014 to extend me for one more year. And they came \u2014 Washington came back and said, as a matter of fact, we\u2019ve just cut this down to a three year as \u2014 for your \u2014 your \u2014 the next. There are too many people who want to go to Geneva, so from now on it\u2019s going to be a three year assignment, not a four year assignment, and \u2014 and we can\u2019t extend you for the fifth year. I told them that I would retire, one more year and I retire. So in 1974 in September s \u2014 in \u2014 well, we came home in \u2014 around the first of August. 1974 I had some leave \u2014 \u201978, excuse Interview with Charles Stein \u201c June 8, 1999 me, \u201978. It\u2019s been a few years, but \u201974 is when I got there. Okay, we came home. I had leave and when I got back to work, I was assigned a \u2014 well, I was told that I had a choice of assignments, but my \u2014 my first as-assignment would have been with the new office that I had originally pr \u2014 created in that \u2014 the inspection report that I\u2019d written. The assistant secretary for humanitarian affairs, and I would have been a deputy in there. But I didn\u2019t \u2014 I rejected that because the other person who was in the deputy \u2014 in the assistant secretary\u2019s job, we\u2019ve had some differences, major differences and I wouldn\u2019t work for that person. And so I said no. As it happened, someone else had found out that I was on the way back and had said if possible, could I get assigned to that office, and that was the Office of Consular Affairs, which was the last report I did in \u2014 as a \u2014 an inspector, and \u2014 someone I had dealt with also on refugee affairs and other things. And the \u2014 so I went to that office, and they told me that they had \u2014 wha \u2014 wha -- what my plans were and I said, I plan to retire, I had decided I retire the end of the year. December, I\u2019m through. Got three months, that\u2019s it. And they say well, we just have a job for you, exactly for that. There is a presidential commission on the rewriting of the immigration laws. And we have to send a State Department representative to that. It is \u2014 it is a\u2014 in \u2014 physically located in the Justice Department. And how would you like to represent us? And I said, do I know anything about the immigration Interview with Charles Stein \u00b0\u00b0 June 8, 1999 laws? They said, of course you do. I said, in that case PIl \u2014 I'll go. I took that assignment and I spent most of my next two and a half months over at the Justice Department with \u2014 oh, the Justice Department, the Immigration-Naturalization Department, we went over all the immigration rules and laws and all that to see what would happen, what should be done, and I put in the State Department and put \u2014 which I got from \u2014 from my people, I went back to state, but whenev \u2014 whatever questions came up, I checked with the department, see what their position was and brought it up and we wrote that report, went in \u2014 it was supposed to be finished and to Congress by the end of the year. We finished up and it was going into the typewriter on about the middle of December, at which time I said goodbye and I left, I never read the report, I never saw it afterwards. I knew what was in there, but it didn\u2019t go anywhere anyway. It was a \u2014 it was as a lot of these reports go, Congress does whatever they want to do. I went back and went through the process, out-processing thing, and then the last day of December, the 30\" of December, last day was a Saturday, I think. So on that Friday I said goodbye to everybody and got a plaque for the wall and hung it on it \u2014 went home, hung it on the wall and it\u2019s been catching dust ever since there. I retired. That was the end of my \u2014 my government career."

Jeff was born in 1978, and well, having once been a medical student, I had an opportunity to read the book again and brush up, because a week before he was born, and he was about due, we had a snowstorm in \u2014 in \u2014 we lived in \u2014 over in the Alexandria area then. And our street, there was a six foot snow drift at the end of the street, we were completely snowed in, there was nothing that could go in or out, and we were waiting. And so I was reading the book and said well, if it happens, I think I know what to do. I remembered as a young medical student, as first year medical students will do, sneak into other classes, I went into one class once where there was \u2014 this was an obstetrics class and they were observing a birth. And so I saw that everything that was going on and I figured I can do that. Of course, I was scared to death, but Jeff was kind enough to wait for another week and by that time this \u2014 the road was cleared. Then four years later Jim came along and David a couple of years after that. I had \u2014 when we went to Switzerland, Jeff was going into his third year of high school, Jim had just finished elementary school and David was going into the fifth grade.

And they went to an international school, which was very Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about this collection Interview with Charles Stein *\" June 8, 1999 useful, learned French. Had an interesting one with our youngest one David, who was 10 years old when we got there. And after the \u2014 oh, about two-thirds down the first year, the French teacher called me at the office one day and said, you know, I can\u2019t get anything out of David, he doesn\u2019t do his homework, he doesn\u2019t do anything, he won\u2019t say anything. I don\u2019t know what he knows. I said, well, let me talk to him. I came home that day and we lived in an apartment building, it was a \u2014 a block, four buildings around a big park. Was a \u2014 a beautiful thing and the kids were playing soccer down there and all that. And I came home and David was playing down there, they\u2019re playing \u2014 they were playing soccer and I went down into the park and I listened to \u2014 I was looking for David and I hear him talk. And this kid is talking French to his buddies like a native. And so aft \u2014 I let him finish the game and then they \u2014 when he came upstairs, I said, hey, your French teacher says you\u2019re not doing any work in French. And he said, yeah, well you \u2014 th-they have all this \u2014 this grammar and I don\u2019t know anything about that. I said, well, you have to study it. And he said well, but I don\u2019t need it. I can talk French. I said yeah, I \u2014 I just noticed that. I didn\u2019t know you could I had not noticed that at all. So next day I called the teacher and I told her what he had \u2014 what I-I observed. I said, please engage him in \u2014 in a conversation outside of the classroom and see \u2014 see what he comes up with. She called me that afternoon and she said, forget Interview with Charles Stein \u201c\u00b0 June 8, 1999 everything I said. He\u2019s ok \u2014I don\u2019t care whether he knows grammar or not. So that was an interesting experience. The other two of course, also learned French and enjoyed \u2014 and first they were a little apprehensive when they got there, because they were in a strange country and it \u2014 this was something new.

We d \u2014 we traveled a lot, they traveled a lot and of course, what they \u2014 what got them about skiing, maybe I \u2014 did I mention that before when I \u2014 when I came home the day when I got the assignment in Switzerland, I \u2014I called my wife and told her, Barbara this \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re going to Switzerland, she said, great.

And Jeff, of course who was a \u2014 all \u2014 all the kids were skiers. I was a skier so I \u2014 I taught them early. And I said \u2014 Jeff said oh yeah, yeah, skiing, Switzerland, yeah, that\u2019s it, let\u2019s go. And the other two chimed in, yeah, let\u2019s go.

They knew bits and pieces of \u2014 they knew who I was. They knew where I came from, they knew what I\u2019d gone through, a little bit.

Apparently the Germans had registered all this. Had it in alphabetical order and it was found after the war, the Polish government had it, and finally got to Yad Vashem and \u2014 and \u2014 and to the museum. And I opened it to the S\u2019s and went to Stein and there was my mother and my father and the rest of the family. And I found a \u2014 there was a date when they ar \u2014 who they were, their profession, their date of birth, when they arrived in the \u2014 in the ghetto, and when they left the ghetto. Now, the leaving of the ghetto for most of them was later dates, and to my knowledge that was before the \u2014 that was after the Chelmno death camp had been closed, that was the ausch \u2014 they were mostly to Auschwitz then, or other concentration camps. But my parents and some others, I noticed the \u2014 the final depr \u2014 disposition there is a \u2014 it said TR7. I remembered from my readings that there were certain time periods when there were transports to \u2014 to Chelmno. And so right after that I went to looking into some of the other books that I had read that had this thing and then I remembered the first one was Gilbert and I read in there, there were seven transports from the 21\u2018 to the 28\" of February, 1942 to Chelmno, transport seven was on the 20\" of February. That was closure to me. I knew on the 27\" of \u2014 27 \u2014 28\", excuse me, 28\" of February, they had died at Chelmno."

I found not only my Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Charles Stein \" June 8, 1999 grandfather\u2019s gun, with his name on it and all that, with a label, but also some papers he had apparently given, some pa \u2014 passport \u2014 well, I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not sure what it \u2014 what it was, I can\u2019t remember. I looked at it afterwards, but I can\u2019t \u2014 but some documents that are also sitting right there. So she found her grandfather there. It was \u2014 it was a heartwarming thing. I had another one, I was loading the elevators, and it was a quiet period, and I had a family coming in around \u2014 what looked like a husband and wife and two grown children, children in their 20\u2019s. And I directed them to the \u2014 to the I.D. cards and said, pick up an I.D. card. The man picked up an I.D. card, and the next \u2014 I was looking at him, next he said, oh my God. I said, anything wrong? He said no. We are from Holland and I picked a card, this is a person from my town in Holland. I didn't know anybody was in the Holocaust in Holland, in \u2014 from my town. Some small town he lives in. They looked like professional people. But, and I-I-I said, well, th-that\u2019s very unusual. And he said, oh, when I get back I will \u2014 I will give this to the mayor. We will \u2014 I will \u2014 will tell them that we \u2014 we have to do something, you know, a plaque or something for a person ah \u2014 we didn \u2014 I don\u2019t think anybody even knows or remembers that. I said, that\u2019s wonderful, please do that. And there were several other things like that that happened that are very nice to know. I read \u2014 oh, well, an amazing thing. One day I \u2014 Iwas \u2014I was the information desk, and a man walked up to me. And he looks at Interview with Charles Stein \u00ae June 8, 1999 me and I looked at him and he \u2014 some [indecipherable] looked familiar, wasn\u2019t sure what it was. He said, you\u2019re Stein. I looked at him. I said, ve seen you somewhere, way back. He says, yeah, in [indecipherable] he started speaking German. Somebody I knew in Vienna, and as a matter of fact I also knew him in New York, but we \u2014 he had \u2014 he changed comple \u2014 I-I don\u2019t know, he \u2014 I guess I didn\u2019t change much, but he recognized me. I didn\u2019t recognize him, but I had known him in \u2014 in New York and \u2014 about 1939 \u2014 1940, I guess, and then sort of lost track, I hadn\u2019t seen him since about then \u2014 since then. So we \u2014 we had a long talk. Those are some of the things. Vis-Visitors, I have a \u2014 I have my own personal policy in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in visitor services. There\u2019s no German or Austrian that comes to the museum that does not go and see it, I don\u2019t care whether there are tickets or not. I always have some \u2014 my own tickets in my pocket. I always save some for just those. And I\u2019ve had many cases where I \u2014 I think they need to go see, see their own history. Not mine, their history, now. And I\u2019ve had some of them come back, f-find me again, look me up and \u2014 and thank me for \u2014 for letting them see. They says, you know, we read a lot about it, we heard a lot about it, but not like this. I said, that\u2019s right. It\u2019s all there. I enjoy working with groups, school groups mostly, where we go a little deeper into the \u2014 the subject matter, and I\u2019m particularly 1-interested in the questions the kids ask. And some of them are good. And then I have right now Interview with Charles Stein \u201d June 8, 1999 still \u2014 still there from last year, so I guess two years now, the artwork down at the elevator, the basement \u2014 the concourse elevator. The first thing as you walk in on the left hand side is that large picture of the police station in Vienna, the one I lived next door to. The one I\u2019ve been in. And so, after we \u2014 I tell them all about the museum, I say, well while you\u2019re waiting for the elevator, take a look at this one. It might give you something a little personal. I was in that police station, I lived right next door to it. I been in there many times before the Germans moved in and after the Germans moved in, I was in there asking for permission to leave the country. And then I get all kinds of questions. Oh, were you there, oh. And, you know. The elevators, fortunately take a long time to come down to \u2014 to the concourse and so we got \u2014 have time to answer those questions. Makes an impression, and it gives them one more dimension to [indecipherable]. I also \u2014 1 s \u2014 I \u2014 excuse me, I started this program, which they are n\u2014 are now continuing, o-of the \u2014 when I was on the \u2014 on the [indecipherable] of taking people through and having survivors telling their stories at certain places that they\u2019re particularly \u2014 that they\u2019re \u2014 were involved in. And I just saw in those latest \u2014 you may have seen that \u2014 that they \u2014 Pete Philips is now going to do it this fall again for th-the paid staff of visitor services. And they need it. Paid staff 1s, you know, they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re the most temporary employees \u2014 o-of visitor services, are the most temporaries 1-in the Interview with Charles Stein i June 8, 1999 museum. They come in, it\u2019s their first job after college and they can\u2019t wait to get their one year in to get status to apply for another job somewhere, because they\u2019re not paying them. The pay is \u2014 is ridiculous. And so they\u2019re not putting heart and soul into it like we do."

It was dormant too long, and of course in my own case, in Austria, the Austrians never considered themselves as the first victims until what, 1992 or \u201993 when Chancellor Vranitzky said hey, let\u2019s forget about that, we\u2019re just as guilty as the rest of them. And then all of a sudden they said oh yeah, yes we are.
