This interview is part of the museum\u2122s project to interview Holocaust survivors and witnesses who are also volunteers with the museum. This is a follow-up interview that will focus on Mr. Stein\u2122s post-Holocaust experiences. In preparation for th is interview I listened to the interview you conducted with the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation on February 27 th, 1997. I will not ask you to repeat everything you said in that interview, instead I will use this interview as an opportunity to follow up on that interview and focus on your post-Holocaust experiences. This is tape number one, side A. What was your name at birth?",
            "answer": "My name was Karl Robert Stein. The only thing that is different from \u0152 from present time is the first name. Karl was changed to Charles, but it \u0152 actually, I didn't change it. It was changed by the authorities in Luxembourg when they issued me a passport. They simply wrote in there, and my name in \u0152 in that Luxembourg stateless passport on which I traveled after I left Austria was \u0152 they Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 4translate it into the French, Charles, which is the same as \u0152 same spelling as Charles and that\u2122s remained that way."

Yes, the only one that I encountered on the way through the \u0152 in the campaign was Nordhausen, concentration camp Nordhausen , which we came upon not knowing where we \u0152 that there was a concentration until we \u0152 til we ran into it. It was a \u0152 it was a horrible experience. Knowing that my parents must be in one of those, I \u0152 I sort of instinctively started looking around to see if I could see my parents. It wa \u0152 it was a \u0152 an im pression that stayed with me for a long time. It was the \u0152 bodies lying around, people wandering around in a daze. We tried Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 6to, the little time that we had, we were moving pretty fast at the time, chasing the rest of the Germans in the direction of the \u0152 of the Russians. And we were there for about a day or two, I did interrogate some of the guards. They \u0152 some of them, as I recall, were Ukrainian guards that the survivors of \u0152 of the camp \u0152 many of them by the way in Nordhausen w-was one of the camps that had a lot of slave labors from eastern Europe, a lot of Yugoslavs that I encountered there. They wanted those guards. And if I lost any of them on the way, I \u0152 I-I can\u2122t remember. But they \u0152 the guards were scared. I recall one guard, who absolutely refused to talk. And we had ways of, you know, in terrogate \u0152 ways of interroga te \u0152 this \u0152 this was not a friendly interrogation, so we made them ta lk. Not by physical fo rce in any way, but by \u0152 oh, various things. Like we have hi m take off his clothes. And when a man stands there in front of you without his clothes on, he\u2122ll start talking pretty soon, we found out. That\u2122s an interesting thing we learned over \u0152 over the \u0152 we sort of picked up as we went through the war and \u0152 interrogation techniques that they didn\u2122t teach us in school. But he f \u0152 he talked and I got \u0152 I got his story, of course, I can\u2122t remember the details now. But I did get a \u0152 the story of some of the atrocities that the \u0152 they were \u0152 they committed. I turned the people over \u0152 the \u0152 the guards over to the military police that picked them up and took them back to prison camps. Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 7"

            "answer": "Yes, well, in the military I was \u0152 I was \u0152 I went to \u0152 I was originally in field artillery. I went to officer candidate school and became \u0152 I was an artillery officer. And then I was, shortly after graduation at Fort Sill, Oklahoma where the artillery school was, I was tapped for intelligence because of my background in languages and so forth. I was called one night \u0152 one evening I was called in and was told that Washington , in quotes, at that time wanted me to go to \u0152 wanted me to go to the intelligence school, which was at Fort Ritchie, right in \u0152 in Maryland here, then called Camp Ritchie. That was the military intelligence school and we went through interrogation training and all kinds of intelligence training. Oh, we learned all kinds of things like Morse code, which I have never used in my life. Don\u2122t know anybody who ever did, and folder interpretation, map reading of foreign maps, which was important because some of the captured maps we had to \u0152 to know what we saw, and we had all kinds of field training with those. These were Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 8Maryland \u0152 Maryland maps, maps of the \u0152 of the Ritchie area, but printed in various languages including Japanese. I reme mber one night that they dropped me off someplace at a place and gave me this \u0152 this map. And from landmarks and all that, you identified where you were and which way you we re going. Well, that was important but in \u0152 basically for me that was not a problem because I was fluent in German, of course, my native language, I also knew French. And that\u2122s the direction we went in, so once we got there, I could easily read those maps if \u0152 if necessary. We were trained in order of battle, identifying \u0152 we learned everything about the German \u0152 we knew more about the German army, their uniforms, their \u0152 their insignia. That was all part of \u0152 of the training and the units, the organization of the German army, what units looked like, what they were, how ba \u0152 how strong they were, etcetera. That was all part of it because that was all part of \u0152 of the interrogation process. And so when we \u0152 when I got into \u0152 to the combat are \u0152 zone, interrogating the people was simple. One thing, for example, was that every German had what was called a soldbuch, a paybook. Now that soldbuch \u0152 soldbuch had all his military a-assignments listed in there. And it was easy to figure out who he was and what he was. So the first thing we\u2122d ask them is, give me your soldbuch. And they would hand it over and you had them right there, that was \u0152 now you knew. And so then you would say, oh you were from the 338 th Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 9F\u00fcsilier-Batallion(ph), yeah? And he\u2122d say yeah, and take it from there. Most of the interrogations were actually not difficult. Most of them talked. Now you ran into some, officers mainly, who said name, rank and se rial number, that\u2122s all they would give you. But ag ain, you \u0152 we \u0152 all of us, I think, found ways to \u0152 to break them. For example is one thing, a German, regardless of whether you were friend or enemy, respected rank. So you made su re that the insignia you were \u0152 you were wearing at the time, and we had a complete collection of it, were at least one rank higher than the man we had, and we could read that. So we \u0152 we played that game, it was \u0152 if you had time for it. Now a lot of \u0152 most of it was right up in the front lines, so you didn\u2122t have time to \u0152 to play games. And at those times we would just play tough, yeah. Threaten, all kinds of things, you know, we would \u0152 we \u0152 we\u2122d say \u0152 we\u2122d tell them, okay, we\u2122ll let you wa lk back home, right through the front lines. Of course they wouldn\u2122t do that cause they\u2122d get shot. And things like that, and they would \u0152 I don\u2122t really recall a nyone I could not break in an \u0152 in an interrogation, and I\u2122ve interrogated thousands of them. Now, what we did with the information, and we \u0152 we \u0152 in my case, being in the front lines, I would \u0152 my targets were who was opposing us, how strong are they, where are they located, what kind of weapons do they have, where\u2122s their artillery. And I would immediately call in to artillery to give them the coordinate of locations so that they Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 10could fire on it, and my infantry units that I supported would get all the information \u0152 the \u0152 the intelligence officer of the unit would get all the information that was relevant to who \u0152 who was on the other side of the line, what was their morale, how \u0152 how strong were they, what kind of wea pons did they have. And that went \u0152 well, we had a lot of good results. One of the things that I and my team always did was when we had specific targets that we could identify, after we had pushed through the area we checked those targets to make su \u0152 to see if they had been hit like we \u0152 and I think most of them were. So, it was \u0152 in Normandy it was \u0152 is rough, cause we were going from hedgerow to hedgerow , you know, one hedgerow at a time, and you know, a hundred \u0152 a hundred yards a day, things like that. But after that, of course, on the run, that was a little different. Once we broke through, it was \u0152 it was a different story, it was easier then."

            "question": "You mentioned in your interview for the Shoah Foundation that British intelligence was superior to American intelligence. Can you clarify that point for me?",
            "answer": "Yes, I \u0152 I went to \u0152 I was shipped to England in December of 1943. I was in England until \u0152 until D-Day, so that was six months from \u0152 in England. And at the time I was sent to \u0152 from where we were out in the near \u0152 in the country somewhere, I was sent to London to study with \u0152 with British intelligence. They Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 11had some schools and they \u0152 they took us into \u0152 and gave us some \u0152 some information. The British had a lot more experience. We had absolutely no experience, we were new. We were \u0152 all of \u0152 not \u0152 I\u2122m not just talking about the \u0152 the front line type intelligence, but the OSS didn\u2122t exist until just about that time. And they had never, the people in the OSS were not what the British had trained for years and years as intelligence officers. We all learned fr \u0152 by \u0152 by doing. The \u0152 I had some contact with OSS people afte \u0152 on \u0152 well, on \u0152 actually still in Europe, but on the way home. They we re going home at the same time, and I listened to some of their stories. They were droppe d \u0152 one particular I remember, who was an artist, or at least that is what he \u0152 he faked. He was of Italian descent, a New Yorker who spoke Italian. He was dropped into Normandy and he sat around painting. He was \u0152 to the Germans he was an Italian painter visiting here, and was friendly right, to \u0152 Italy was a friendly country. And that\u2122s the way he collected intelligence. But he said he had absolutely no idea what he was doing when he first got in there. He got in by parachute, got \u0152 the French helped him \u0152 French underground helped him. And then he \u0152 he sat aro \u0152 he tha \u0152 he started painting and reporting and they had equipment to \u0152 to report. And he was around Normandy and the Sherbrooke(ph) peninsula doing this artw ork. Course na \u0152 he brought nothing home. He all gave that to \u0152 to his French comrades there. But again, no Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 12experience. Everything was \u0152 whatever we did was done for the first time, on the U.S. side. And now, as I said, the British, of course, had been doing their in-intelligence work, collection of intelligence all over the world with the \u0152 with the colonies and all that. So \u0152 a-and in World War II, of course, they\u2122d been in the war for three years before we came in, or almost three years. That was wa-why I said that their \u0152 their intelligence was better, they were better organized. We were just learning, but we got there. We \u0152 just like everything else, I think, in the \u0152 in the U.S. Army. That army had absolutely no experience, we came from all over the place. Nobody \u0152 there were no real soldiers at th \u0152 in 1941. By 1944 we did the \u0152 the biggest \u0152 biggest job ever done in any \u0152 any invasion. And it was successful. So I guess as Americans, we\u2122re \u0152 we\u2122re quick learners. We picked up an awful lot from the British. They were very helpful. They taught us then. The schools that I went to in \u0152 in London during that period were very informative, because we talked to people who had been there, who ha d been there, done that and told us how \u0152 how they did whatever we were doing la ter on. That\u2122s \u0152 that\u2122s about \u0152 that\u2122s about it for \u0152 on that."

            "answer": "Well, there are \u0152 there were \u0152 for example, the \u0152 the \u0152 what they didn\u2122t teach us, they taught us that e-every soldier has a soldbuch, but didn\u2122t tell us what to do with it. That is we picked up ourselves. I \u0152 I picked up the first one I looked at and I said, there it is. And I asked the man ha \u0152 you were up with \u0152 I told him, I didn\u2122t ask him, I told him, you were up from this and this regiment, or this \u0152 and they said yes. And before that you were something else. One of the things that we did was when \u0152 when time allowed, was engage in some small talk. Small talk about, well, you got your family back home, and th at would open up suddenly, and then you lead into other things. I had some interesting interrogations. I had \u0152 and this is \u0152 this is one in a \u0152 in a \u0152 in a billion, probably. Had a prisoner, this \u0152 we were about \u0152 we were in Germany at the time. And he had very little information, but he was willing to talk. He said tha \u0152 actually, he deserted he told me. I\u2122m not sure that that was right, but it didn\u2122t matter. But I noticed in papers that he had on him that he was a medical student at the University of Vienna. And so I asked him a \u0152 whether he was \u0152 took anatomy from Professor Bernkopf(ph) Versowzer (ph) and his mouth opened and he se \u0152 di -di-ta-ba \u0152 how \u0152 but how did you know? I said, I\u2122m an intelligence officer, I know everything. And he just couldn\u2122t understand why, Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 14and then he started opening up and told me all kinds of things about what happened to his family and others. His mother-in-law was mentally incompetent and she was in \u0152 in Vienna in a place that was known to me, that was the insane asylum in Vienna, there was one big one. And she had been killed, and he told me that they were killing these \u0152 well, handicapped people, mentally handicapped. They didn\u2122t need them, so they killed them. And you know, he was mad and so he said he deserted. Well, took him a long time to desert. But th \u0152 it-it\u2122s that kind of thing that \u0152 that those are interesting little things that happened. There were many of them, of the different nature. For example, in the Battle of the Bulge, the unit I was with was holding one of the \u0152 you know, the corn ers of \u0152 of the thing. We were not penetrated, but we \u0152 we \u0152 we went in ther e to hold it, and that was in the famous Battle of the H\u00fcrtgen Forest. And there was a German lieutenant colonel in there with his troops, holding out. And we could \u0152 it\u2122s a dense forest and we just couldn't get him out. And one day one of \u0152 a couple of Germans came out with a white flag and said that they\u2122re currently \u0152 name I \u0152 I can\u2122t remember the name, but it was a rather, later on, well known in \u0152 in \u0152 in the history of the war. What was his name? Well, can\u2122t remember. Anyhow, so who was sent in to bring \u0152 yeah, he was sick. He was very sick and he wanted to surrender. And so who was sent in to bring him out, of course? The only one who spoke Ge rman. And in I went and I got him out Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 15and we had \u0152 the man had pneumonia very badly. But \u0152 and, you know, interrogating him at this point was really not necessary. There was nothing he could tell us in the \u0152 in the present situation. But he was on his own, just started talking as we carried him out. His own men carried him on a stretcher. And we came out of the forest and then we waited until he was evacuated. And he just told us all kinds of war stories, was just great. Good information. Not ne cessarily tactical information, but strategically important of how decisions were made and all that. Well, we took that down and got it back to higher headquarters and I don\u2122t know what they did with it, but at least the information was there. So these were the kind of things that you fell into occasionally."

Although, I\u2122m not sure that they were anywhere near any of the atrocities or anything like that. But the Waffen SS was a tough outfit, in the beginning. Not in the \u0152 t-towards the end of the war, they filled in the blanks in \u0152 in the \u0152 the blank spaces in those organizations with just about anybody, in cluding, I think, I\u2122m not sure whether I told that \u0152 told you that story earlier about the boy, about a 17 year old kid who told me that he was an American. I said, oh yes? He said yes. He said, take off my Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 16boot. Took off his boot, took out an inners ole and came out with a green card with a baby\u2122s picture on it. His family had gone \u0152 had come to America and his parents were in \u0152 in Los Angeles . Yeah, came to America in the \u0152 sometime in the late 20\u2122s, early 30\u2122s, I guess. He was a baby then, and was a small \u0152 small \u0152 small child. They applied for a \u0152 they became perman ent residents and probably, his parents later, citizens. But he was sent to his grandmother in Germany to go to school, they wanted him to go to school in Germany. Well, he did, he went back, and war broke out and when he got to be about 16 or so they pulled him in, this was towards the end of the war. And there he was in a Waffen SS uniform.

When we \u0152 when I talked to some people in \u0152 well, some Germans at that point, we were at the Czech border \u0152 no, that was afterward. We were still on the Elbe.

Figured that \u0152 I knew \u0152 I had known that my parents had been deported to L\u00f3dz, because in \u0152 it was two weeks after I went into the army in \u0152 in October \u212241, I got a postcard that is \u0152 it came to New York and to my \u0152 the second cousin who lived in New York, or \u0152 was my \u0152 my address that I had. And he brought it to me and saying that a postcard had come saying that my Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 18parents were being deported in October of \u212241, to Litzmannstadt, L\u00f3dz, to the ghetto. That\u2122s the last information I had. After that, nothing. And so I wanted to go to Vienna, but the army wouldn\u2122t let me. As an intelligence officer, the Russians were in \u0152 had \u0152 had Vienna at the time and that part of Austria and they wouldn\u2122t let us go into the Russian zone. So at that point I decided I\u2122ll go home, to New York at that time. And by October \u0152 the war was over in March \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 excuse me, in May, May the ninth, excuse me. A nd we were \u0152 my team was pulled out in \u0152 in July and sent back to Paris where our headquarter \u0152 military intelligence headquarters was. First to \u0152 to another place in \u0152 in Germany and then to Paris. And we stayed there for shipment home. There were lots of things at that point, we could have signed up as a civilian to civil government and all the things that were going on, but I decided my best bet wa s to go home and start looking from \u0152 from that angle, and if necessary I\u2122d come back as a civilian and of course, I intended to get out of the army, which I did in 19 45, and I was separated in \u0152 in the 14th of December, 1945, and signed on as a reserve officer. I stayed on in the reserves."

I was signed up for a transport, one of those youth transports in \u0152 back in 1938, immediately after the anschluss .

And I had asked you about if you had considered going to Palestine and you were telling me that you did have some Zionist thoughts and you were considering going to Palestine and also you were considering medical school.",
            "answer": "Right. In early \u212246, I was considering both of these thin gs. And in \u0152 I was accepted. I had written to and sent my \u0152 my papers to \u0152 o-of my previous studies to Basel(ph) and Zurich and I was accepted in both of them, provisionally, if space was available in later years. I was accepted for the first year, but for one year only Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 21and depending on space av ailable, whatever. And at the same time, I had \u0152 this was now early 1946, and I had talked to a lot \u0152 lot of people, you know, after returning and I found out how all these people made al l this money, in all kinds of things. And I said maybe I ought to do \u0152 make a little money, I had no ne. I had whatever I had saved from my army pay, which wasn\u2122t very much. I wasn\u2122t working, I had not found a way to \u0152 to do anything and so I said why, why don\u2122t I do something else first? So I \u0152 I dropped Palestine and I dropped medicine a nd I went into the export business. Opened my own busin \u0152 I took \u0152 we ll, first of all I had to learn something about the export, and that was the big thing then that I \u0152 I found out. And I had to learn something about it. Fortunately i-in the newspapers I found a two week course that would teach me all about it, and that\u2122s exactly what I did, I \u0152 I went \u0152 I mean, this is strictly an amateur performance at the time. I went and took a two week course and I knew all about it, I knew how to \u0152 what kind of documents you needed, and how \u0152 and all I needed now is to find out what I was going to sell and where. Well, I and a fr \u0152 a \u0152 a wartime buddy of mine, friend, we\u2122d been through the war together, and I, decided we\u2122d go into the export business, and we did. And we si \u0152 decided that the electrical appliances were a good thing, we \u0152 I guess we liked electrical appliances, so we went into that and we deci ded that we would do South America \u0152 Latin America as \u0152 as our target. That, we had read was good Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 22place to do, and we did. Went into business, we \u0152 we got in contact with some manufacturers of appliances, and we went to various embassies and asked for their importer \u0152 lists of importers, which was available. And we started writing let \u0152 by that time, by the way, I had taken, soon as it came back, I started taking a Spanish \u0152 I don\u2122t know why, but the G.I. bill was there and I didn't kn ow what else to do with it until I went to medical school, which would have been \u0152 so I took Spanish and I was fairly fluent in Spanish by that time, it was now middle of 1946. By that time we \u0152 we got to the point where I n \u0152 I needed. And so I wrote up a catalog in Spanish, we put that up and a \u0152 a letter to all the customers and began working. Pretty soon we were making a little money, not very much. Not enough to live on, but there was still a G.I. bill that helped us out with that. And it lasted for \u0152 until early 1948. In early 1948 there was a sudden stop of dollars . The dollar was no longer available for payment to foreign countries, there was a shortage of d \u0152 of dollars, there was \u0152 there were \u0152 there were exchange restrictions. And so the big com-companies could give, you know, six months credit to \u0152 to compan \u0152 the little companies, like ours, we couldn\u2122t give any credit, we worked strictly as letter of credit. They sent a letter of credit in dollars to our bank and as soon as the ship \u0152 we could turn over the shipping documents , that the merchandise had been shipped, the bank would release the money. Well, that stopped, there were no more dollar Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 23letters of credit and so we went out of business. And then started an interesting period. I didn\u2122t know which way to turn, I \u0152 I\u2122d never even looked for a job, I didn\u2122t know how to look for \u0152 well, I \u0152 I knew how, but th-th-th \u0152 I didn\u2122t know what. I \u0152 so I went around and went to an employment office, one of those employment agencies and they said yeah, as a matter of fa \u0152 it was on 46 th Street and Fifth Avenue, I remember. And they said yeah, we have a job. There\u2122s \u0152 there\u2122s a job opened right across the street here at a place called Nancy Studios , hat makers. Feather hats. You know, past ed feather on \u0152 on the thing. And \u0152 I mean, I \u0152 I found that out when I went to \u0152 to Nancy\u2122s. And so I went ik \u0152 went over there and they needed someone to run their office. Apparently whoever had the office had quit \u0152 was running the office had quit. So I went up there and there\u2122re two ladies running the shop and I sa id, here I am. They said oh yes, you\u2122ll do. We \u0152 you know, told them who I wa s and what I had done, I had my own business and all that. And they \u0152 they \u0152 th ey thought that was \u0152 that was good, so my major job was making up the payroll and invoices and making sure that money got to the bank and so forth. But the envi ronment wasn\u2122t for me. This was a \u0152 a \u0152 the two ladies was Nancy and her sister were the designers of these hats. Their clientele was \u0152 were all name designers. Hattie Carnegie, Lily Dach\u00e9, a-all kind \u0152 you know, th-the \u0152 well known names in the fashion business, and they would Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 24design special things for them, and others . Had about 20 or 30 women doing the work, so it was not a small place. But I started dealing with the clients and that\u2122s \u0152 it was something I couldn\u2122t take. I-It was a strange \u0152 you know, being called darling by these floating char acters who were dressed in diff \u0152 i-it was not \u0152 not my \u0152 my cup of tea. But I worked, I \u0152 I had to make a living and I was looking around. And \u0152 and I worked there during the summe r. I came home one day in September, it was September of \u212248, and I looked at my mail and there was a letter there from the Pentagon. I opened it up and it said, dear Captain Stein , we want you back. We have a special project here which is right in line with your experience during the war and please call this number. So I called the number in \u0152 in the \u0152 in Washington and talked to a major and he said \u0152 he told me what it was. It was in the office of the chief of military history, translating the experiences of the German general staff that apparently the United States had under contract of some sorts, in and out of jail in Germany, that were writing their heart out about their experiences on the eastern front in Russia. And I said that sounds interesting, yes, I\u2122m available. And in Novem \u0152 early Nove mber, starting in nove \u0152 as a matter of fact, the third of November, I \u0152 I came into Washington. Harry Truman and I came at th \u0152 came together. That was the day Harry Truman was elected. I came into Washington, back in uniform, and I was in the Pentagon, became chief of the Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 25translation section of milt \u0152 o-office of chief of military history and I spent the next three years there translating and \u0152 and writing. And by that time, of course, in 1950, summer of 1950 the Korean war brok e out, and \u0152 \u212250 or \u212251 \u0152 yeah, \u212250. Well, I still had some \u0152 a year to go and \u0152 on my \u0152 my three yea \u0152 it was a three year appointment. And when the time was up, my time was up, I was told that nobody gets out, there\u2122s a war on. And I was told that I was \u0152 but I was told I was going to Germany, to the German side of our project. And two weeks later I got my orders saying report to San Francisco for shipment to Korea. And there I was, not exactly going to Germany. Well, I went to Korea , and went, checked in, was received by the officer in charge of \u0152 of that unit and \u0152 who said, do you speak \u0152 is it \u0152 you came here as a prisoner of wa r interrogator, which was one of my specialties. Oh, let me back up for a moment. While I was still in Washington, when I got my orders and I read this thing, that I \u0152 I was going over with the MOS, the specialty as a \u0152 as a prisoner of war interrogator, I went down to what we called Korean man \u0152 what was called Korean management, we called it Korean manglement , and was talking to some old col onel who\u2122d been there since world \u0152 since the Civil War, I think. Looked like it. And I said look, I have \u0152 you\u2122re sending me to Korea with a 93-16. I don\u2122t speak any of those languages. And he said, well, we didn\u2122t asked for no languages, they just said they wanted 93-16s. Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 26And I said, yes, sir. I knew there was nothing \u0152 yeah \u0152 well, I talked to this major and he said, do you speak Korean? I said nope. He said, Japanese? The Koreans in the \u0152 in the army at that time grew up under Japanese occupation, so most of them spoke \u0152 still spoke some Japanese, too. I said nope. He said, Chinese? I said, nope. He says, you\u2122re another one . I said, you mean you have more? He said yes. They\u2122ve been sending us 93-1 6s and we have \u0152 none of them speak Korean. Okay, they said, but never mind, we\u2122ll \u0152 we\u2122ll have an assignment for you. And I was assigned to eighth \u0152 eighth army headquar ters and research and \u0152 and \u0152 yeah, and research, intelligence research. And later on, couple of months later I was reassigned as chief of the order of battle, a division of \u0152 of eighth army headquarters. But the experience there was again, this now is December, end of December 1951. Cold, ice cold, bad weather and all that, and the chief of intelligence, Colonel Bump(ph) when I reported in, I and two other reported in at the same time, said well, I\u2122ve got an assignment for you, I want you to go up to the second infantry division up in the hills and observe the air support for our infantry, and I\u2122ll call you back when the time comes. So we sat up there for about three weeks in the foxholes, on top of these ridge s, watching air support, getting shot at. We didn\u2122t do any shooting then, infantry did. Watching the patrols go out and all that. Anyhow, we got back three weeks later and came in and I was this \u0152 the Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 27senior of the three of us and so I \u0152 I reported. We came in and we saluted and said, Colonel, we have a report for you on the \u0152 on the air support. We had put our notes together and whipped up a report. He said, oh, I don\u2122t want your report, I know all about what\u2122s going on up there. I just sent you up there because nobody works for me who doesn\u2122t get his feet wet. You know what the war is like, now you can start working on it. Was a good idea. Not for \u0152 fo r \u0152 not while we were up there. Okay, so we \u0152 I \u0152 then I \u0152 I started working and th \u0152 stayed there for \u0152 until January of 1953, by which time I have had enough of the war and of the army and well, there \u0152 there happened to be a \u0152 a \u0152 there happened to be something that no \u0152 none of us knew. In the fall of 1952, all the reserve officers got a letter saying that your \u0152 th-the \u0152 you were extended, your \u0152 your fi \u0152 your army still had a five year dur \u0152 as \u0152 of reserve officers, five years at a time , you had to renew every five years. The other services had already changed to perm anent. And so we did th \u0152 by executive order, ba \u0152 ba \u0152 the president, and when the Korean war broke out all reserve officers were frozen, they had to stay in the \u0152 a-all commissions were extended. But the law expired on the first of April 1953. So all of us who were in Korea in 1952 had to be home and out of the army by \u0152 by the first of April, and the army decided that they were going to get us out by January to give us a chance \u0152 to give us time to get back to the United States and get processed out. And so we got this Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 28letter saying we\u2122d like you to sign up fo r the permanent and you\u2122ll go on and all that. And statistics later on came out that said 66 percent of all the reserve officers said thank you but no thank you, including myself. And then in December of 1952, I happened to be \u0152 I still had an R and R leave, five days in \u0152 in Tokyo , I flew over to Tokyo , and I ran into some old friends of mi ne and one of them said, wa \u0152 when you \u0152 where you going? I said well, I\u2122m going home in January. By the end of January I should be on the way home. And he said, what are you going to do? And I said I have no idea. I have no place to go, I have no \u0152 no \u0152 no connections anywhere. So I\u2122ll just go home and I\u2122ll \u0152 I\u2122ll find something. Well, in the \u0152 he said, the \u0152 oh, this \u0152 this friend said, well hey, I\u2122ve got a job for you, a civilian job here in Tokyo . I\u2122m heading up a new office in \u0152 on the first of January. There\u2122s a new command being formed, the United Nations and far e \u0152 and Far East command, a combined command and I\u2122m head of the intelligence policy division and I have one civilian slot, a senior civilian and you\u2122re \u0152 you\u2122re it, if you want it. So I went down to personnel and they explained what it wa s, and they explained to me what it \u0152 what it pays and it paid more than a captain. And all the perks with it and I said yeah, why not. And I signed up right there and they say yeah, you\u2122re \u0152 you\u2122re qu \u0152 I told them \u0152 I had to write up what I was doing and for \u0152 fill out a form. And they said yeah, you qualify. And so there I was, and I stayed on in Tokyo as a civilian Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 29intelligence officer until 1955, when I returned home. That was also the time a little later that same year, \u212253, when I met this air force lieutenant, female, who showed up there and about a year and a half later we were married. And Barbara Kinney (ph) became Barbara Stein . We were married in Tokyo."

And when the final vote was tallied \u0152 again, this of course now is 1950 \u0152 1947. I was Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 32thinking of still again going to Palestine. But there were many things that \u0152 that held me back, you know, personal thi ngs that were happening and I \u0152 it was always, you know, next week, I\u2122ll think abou t it next week or I\u2122ll \u0152 I\u2122ll look into it next week. By that time I had taken up \u0152 I had contact with my cousin ha \u0152 at \u0152 and meanwhile his mother and father, who had gotten away out of Vienna to England , his father was \u0152 came out of Dachau, they released him. Mother had gotten a permit to go to England, and so they went to England , some went to Palestine. And I had seen them in England when I was in England. They had gone to Palestine so a \u0152 a \u0152 we had correspondence th en, and I thought that I might join them, but I didn\u2122t until many years later when I did go over and I\u2122ve been there quite a few times now."

We \u0152 we were fighting \u0152 we \u0152 we were fighting a war, but we weren\u2122t. I see the same thing going on right today in \u0152 in Kosovo , where we \u0152 we\u2122re talking about fighting a war, we\u2122re fighting something. We\u2122re not going in and cleaning it up, and that\u2122s what happened.

There we didn't fi ght to win, we fought to \u0152 to sit around and let somebody do the talking. And so now I \u0152 I-I did not thin k kindly of what was happening there."

            "answer": "The Cold War, of course that was somehow predictable, that having met the Russians, we knew we weren\u2122t going to be friends, although we were friendly and the vodka flowed freely, but that was not it, and then of course when the Russians dug in and said \u0152 and dictated to us practi cally what \u0152 what we \u0152 what we could do and what we couldn\u2122t do, that was pretty much the beginning of the Cold War, and Churchill saw it and \u0152 and it happened. But there were \u0152 there were many things that \u0152 well, it was a political war, it was \u0152 and political wars don\u2122t lead to anything, never have. And there should have b een some accommodation someplace, but nobody would give, we didn't give, they di dn\u2122t give.

            "answer": "Left Tokyo and came to Washington after cruising around the United States for about oh, a good two or three months. We landed in Seattle where Barbara has an aunt and cousins and we stopped there for a few days. Then went to San Francisco where she has another aunt, we visite d there and I got introduced to the family. And then we went to Iowa, to Webster City, Iowa, a great metropolis of about 8,000 people and I met the parents. Parents knew who I was, I had written to them. As a matter of fact, just very recently I went through some papers that when \u0152 her mother died some years ago, but we had never looked through that file of Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 36papers that \u0152 that we had taken from her, and I looked through some paper and there was the letter I wrote to them when I first met Barbara \u0152 or wh-when we decided to get married, and I wrote to them and told them who I was, and got to \u0152 to Webster City and well, had parties and met \u0152 met the whole town. And stayed there for awhile and then went to Washington . In Washington I was then for the first and only time \u0152 no, I ca \u0152 I \u0152 was not the first and only time, my first job in \u0152 in New York was, course, I had to look for a job. But coming to Washington was the first time that I really had to \u0152 really had to lo ok for a job. There was no \u0152 no HIAS to \u0152 to help me out. And I had a \u0152 well, in \u0152 while I was in \u0152 in Tokyo, in \u0152 in \u0152 in my capacity as \u0152 in my job, I had very close contacts with the CIA people out there. And so before I left the chief of the CIA group asked \u0152 said, why don\u2122t you \u0152 when you get home, w hy don\u2122t you just stop in a nd talk to the people in Langley and come with us? And I said, well, that\u2122s nice and he gave me a letter of recommendation. And so I did and they offe red me something that was not for me, they \u0152 they offered me a job in \u0152 in \u0152 a \u0152 a temporary job in Germany and I wasn\u2122t ready to go out \u0152 out again, I wanted to stay awhile. And so I didn\u2122t take that. And then again, by continuous luck, ran into a friend who said, well oh, I know of a new outfit that they\u2122re forming at the \u0152 in the Pentagon and I\u2122ve applied for it. He was working somewhere in the Pentagon. He sa id, to transfer into it and they\u2122ve got Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 37slots open, why don\u2122t you try that? And I tr ied it and I got the job, became his boss. John has never forgiven me that, but we\u2122re still friends. And there I \u0152 I got the job with Air Force Intelligence and worked with them for oh, several years. Got several promotions, I was doing well. Then our organization was taken over into the Defense Intelligence Agency when that was formed, and that took in units from all the military agencies. Stayed with them from \u212262, I was involved in \u0152 in the creation of the new organization, was on that committee, and stayed with them until \u212265 when once again I was invited by the State Department to transfer to the State Department. It happened during a \u0152 a meeting. I was presenting a project that we had \u0152 a worldwide project of intelligence handling that we had, I was involved with through an inter \u0152 through an interagency committee. The State Department representative said, would you be interested in coming to our \u0152 we have nothing like that. And I said, well, make me an offer I can\u2122t resist. And he said the \u0152 about two weeks later, he made me that offer. And I transferred to the State Department in the foreign service and became a foreign service officer, coming in on top, which, much to the \u0152 in the foreign service that \u0152 yo-you\u2122re \u0152 you\u2122re not liked if you come in on top because everybody else came in on the bottom. So I had in-interesting experience."

This is tape two, side A, and you had been telling me about your changes in your professional life with the Air Force Intelligence and Defense Intelligence and then the State Department. Could you walk me through some of those jobs and what your role was, your duties, responsibilities?",
            "answer": "Yeah. In \u0152 I \u0152 I mentioned that this was a new project that my friend told me about in the Air Force Intelligence. What happened was the air force was the, in 1955 was getting into the \u0152 the technological age of information processing. They were the leaders in the thing. They had come up with a project that was worked up with IBM and Eastman-Kodak, a combined project of information processing where the information, that is documents, would be photographed on microfilm, and at the same time, there would be an encoding placed on the microfilm and the coding was then read electronically from the film, and would \u0152 and when you \u0152 when you got the right \u0152 right thing, looking for a specific document that contained a subject matter, th-the subject matter was coded. And that was on there, and that would \u0152 that then would print out the do cument that pertained to whatever you were looking for. That was a \u0152 a new way of doing it, you didn\u2122t have to have any Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 40\u0152 any input, typewriter input that you had until that time . We had to type punch cards and whatever, or type it into the computer and then it would come \u0152 you \u0152 th \u0152 this way you could just ph otograph it. Well, it was a nove l thing, and that is what they \u0152 they were hiring peop le to do that. My job, I became a \u0152 I was hired as the chief of the coding section, and I worked with the tech \u0152 technical part, the \u0152 the contractors on what they were doing and to make sure that we\u2122re do \u0152 and we developed \u0152 and again, we did this with the CIA, a \u0152 a code \u0152 a code dictionary, sort of. An intelligence code, that for everything that was of interest to intelligence, would have a code number. A nd then we would have \u0152 this was my section then, readers read the documents that were coming in, intelligence documents, reports from all over the world, and numerically code what was in that document. That document would then be photographed with the code input also onto the film, and it was available for \u0152 for retrieval. We had gotten that thing, it took a number of years to \u0152 to do this, we worked from \u212255 to about \u0152 by \u212258 or \u212259 we had the first installation, and it worked. We then expanded that to the rest of the air force, and I went out to help the installation of the thing at \u0152 in Omaha at the Strategic Air Command. And in Ohio at the Air Force Research and Development command and several other places, and we started sending out copies of what we had made the film into those. And those were little ch ips, photo chips that ran through just \u0152 Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 41similar to \u0152 to punch cards running through when you\u2122re searching, but these were photo chips and when you got a hit it would extract it and make a full copy of it. Or you could view it on a \u0152 on a microfilm view er. That was the main project. Now, it \u0152 we got into \u0152 more into different arrangements. That unit then was taken over with a lot of the other air force intelligence into the Defense Intelligence Agency when that was established. And I was still in charge of that, but I was working on new developments, now we were into com puter information, handling a computer. It was all intelligence handling. I was not, at that point any more directly involved with the intelligence, but with the technical operation. And it was that, and DIA just a follow on to the same thing. And it was that thing that State Department got interested in. And when I got into State Department, again, they formed a separate unit to start an information processing op eration in the State Department, they didn\u2122t have any. As I found out later, they didn\u2122t want any. The foreign service offices, they didn\u2122t want to ha ve information. He wanted to have what he had, his pieces of paper and he\u2122d make up his own mind, they didn\u2122t want anybody else to \u0152 to shove stuff at him that he didn\u2122t see \u0152 had seen \u0152 hadn\u2122t seen before, to change his mind possibly. Anyhow, that was an \u0152 th at\u2122s an interpretation. But I got to the State Department and we started, there were about four or five of us that had been \u0152 some from the State Department and a couple of people from CIA, myself from the Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 42IAA, and one from USIA, and there was one other \u0152 a couple from the State Department, and we all sat and we started looking at what is it that the foreign service \u0152 tha-that the State Department needs in the \u0152 getting information. Where do they get their information from and how could we put this into a system? In other words, we were systems developmen t. And we then got money through a \u0152 probably my most grueling and demeaning ex perience in my life. I had to testify before Congress, before a congressional committee. It \u0152 the man, my immediate superior in that particular thing, was lost. He and I were sitting there, I was in the left hand seat. The left hand seat is the \u0152 when you\u2122re facing the committee is the \u0152 the secondary. I was the one with the information, he was the one that answered the questions. And a certain congressman from Brooklyn destroyed my buddy. The man was so confused he didn\u2122t know wh at to say and the chairman of the committee excused him and said at this point you\u2122re not answering any more questions, but your sidekick answers the qu estions, so let him answer it and you\u2122re excused, and he wal \u0152 had to leave the \u0152 the committee room. I sat there for the rest of it and I got through it and I got the money. So \u0152 however, was an interesting thing. I was noticing that the chairman\u2122s assistants, the \u0152 not a congressman, one of \u0152 his \u0152 his office manager, wi \u0152 whoeve r he was, had an interesting head movement. And being a good ob server, I had noticed that when they asked first Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 43questions and I was watching that, and I noticed that when he expected a positive answer to something, his head would go this way. And wh en the congressman asked a trick question, the guy went this way. So my eye was on him, and I got through the thing, it worked. I was right, that that was the way, that he knew \u0152 these people know the answers. When they ask a question they know the answer. And so \u0152 they want confirmation of thei r knowledge, and well anyhow, it \u0152 that \u0152 that was \u0152 it was \u0152 it was a sad thing. I came out and poor guy outside, I asked him to go home. He wanted to go back to the office, I said, you should go home. I\u2122ll call you later, I\u2122ll tell you what happened. He sa id, but di-di \u0152 do you know what \u0152 I said, yeah, we got the money, we\u2122re all \u0152 you\u2122re all right, go home. He went home and I called him later on and he had calmed down, and he said, he-hell, I \u0152 I can\u2122t even remember what happened. And very shortly after that he left the State Department, you know, fortunately there was some higher up sitting in the back listening to this thing and they weren\u2122t happy with him, so anyhow. Well, we got the money and we had the department hi re contractors, some of these big information processing firms. They came in and they started working on a program. The program was, oh about half way throug h, and we got more money, because we showed that it was good. This time we didn\u2122t have to testify any more, it was done in the higher-ups. And they \u0152 let\u2122s see, after about \u0152 it was about two and a half Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 44years into the \u0152 into the program, that there was an internal thing. Again, there\u2122s a political thing. The assistant Secretary of State I worked for and another assistant Secretary of State, who wanted that unit, the other one, th-the \u0152 the enemy there, the other one was the assistant secretary for administration, who had the computer operation of the State Department, the pa yroll, in other words. Payroll and personnel and whatever, but never anything subst \u0152 s ubstance \u0152 substantive ininformation, they\u2122d never handle it. But they saw something that hadn\u2122t \u0152 that got money and all kinds of possi ble \u0152 and they wanted it. Well, it was a time when my assistant secretary wanted another job. He wanted to be a \u0152 what do they call that? A diplomat in residence at the university . We had \u0152 the university, they have a diplomat in residence, that a \u0152 that\u2122s a cream puff, absolutely. And usually that led to an ambassadorship. People who were s \u0152 who were selected for that. Well, he was pretty close to that, he wanted an ambassadorship eventually, and he want \u0152 but there was a job that he could have had, but they kept him be cause he had things going on in his o-operation that were not finished, they wouldn\u2122t let him go. So he changed. He sold us a \u0152 he sold my \u0152 my organization to administration. And I said, I\u2122m not available for that. You can tran sfer it, but I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m out. I \u0152 I wouldn\u2122t work for those people, I \u0152 well, I knew them, I had worked with them before. Well, he was friendly enough to say \u0152 he was Je wish, by the way, the only other Jew in Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 45the area. And he said, I didn\u2122t think you would, but I\u2122ve got another job for you, if you want it. We have a new inspector ge neral and I\u2122ve told him about how you go about doing your investigations and how you can do these things and \u0152 and he\u2122s interested in you, because you\u2122ve reviewed, you know what this whole department is doing, you\u2122ve done a survey to \u0152 to find out what they need, and he wants to talk to you. And he\u2122s \u0152 he\u2122s brand new, he just came an \u0152 an ambassador who just came back and got the job as Inspector General. So I made an appointment, went to see him and he said, yeah, I want you. And I became a senior foreign service inspector. Now again, I shifted jobs without try \u0152 ev en trying, you know, I \u0152 I \u0152 I was asked to. And when I got into the Inspector Gene ral\u2122s office, that I hadn\u2122t used before, cause they were not in the substantive area, I found that I was in \u0152 in very good company, because most of the senior inspectors were former ambassadors for whom there was no other assignment, there was a limited assignment. And so they became inspectors and they traveled around from one embassy to the other, to make sure that everything was all right, an d they were doing, you know, reviewing the embassies, mainly. The idea I came up with, that sold m \u0152 sold me to \u0152 to the inspection corps was that there ma \u0152 are many things that are overlapping that are not being looked at in Washington , th-the various bureaus, each one working as an independent thing, each one working with all the embassies that their \u0152 you know, Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 46the European bureaus, working with all the European embassies, but there\u2122s no \u0152 no connection between them. They\u2122re doing all kind \u0152 I said, I would like to look into that. He said that\u2122s a great idea, you got it. So I started out on that and I became \u0152 I was doing \u0152 what\u2122d we call that? Well, the organizational reviews. And I did some of those. As I went on, I did a ll the \u0152 the bureaus, and particularly those that covered in substance more than an embassy. The scientific bureau \u0152 scientific and \u0152 and technical bureau, for example, had these technical attach\u00e9s out there that weren\u2122t talking to each other. So, there \u0152 it was a question of \u0152 of getting information to them and \u0152 I mean, getting information between them and not just reporting back to the bureau and the thing gets lost in the bureau. And the consular offices, for \u0152 of course, there are consulat es in every country and more than there are embassies, and they\u2122re not talking to each other. They\u2122re reporting in, it\u2122s all a one way flow, nothing goes out \u0152 oh, excuse me \u0152 to \u0152 to all the others. And so I started working on that and I usually got a couple of other officers assigned to me, some of the junior officers that were also working with the inspectors and we sat down and we ju \u0152 started interviewing and looking into the records and all that, we find out how things were and sort of rewrote the \u0152 the \u0152 the job descriptions. The \u0152 the job [indecipherable]. I had one particular one that was of great interest to me, having been a refugee once, and that was, I came across, while I was looking at Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 47these various organizations in the department of a special assistant to the Secretary of State for Refugee Affairs. When I looked into that I found that the man was a political appointee. He\u2122d made big contri butions to somebody and he had a few people in Washington , but his work was being done in Geneva at the U.S. mission to the United Nations. In the process I also found that there was a special assistant to the Secretary of State for international Red Cross affairs. Now here we have the international Red Cross, a British a \u0152 a Swiss organization, and they have a one man office with one secretary who\u2122s a special assistant and who handles contacts with that. But the international Red Cross is in Geneva and who handles the \u0152 the br \u0152 the work? The office in Geneva. And this is a large office in the united na \u0152 in the mission to the United Nations. The U.S. mission. And I found a third one, a-aanother special assistant for a humanitar \u0152 for \u0152 not for humanitarian, for disaster relief affairs. Again, all of them political appointees. Well, I went \u0152 so I went to Geneva and talked to the people there and looked and see what they were doing and they were hardworking people. They were doing the budgeting for \u0152 for these various operations. They were representing the U.S. before the United Nations and before all the various organizations that physically handled refugees and disasters and so forth. And I came back and I wrot e a \u0152 oh, about a 200 page report. This was about a six months affair. I wrote a rit \u0152 I wrote a report and I said, reorganize Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 48the whole thing and my s \u0152 my recommenda tion was that \u0152 to get another position as an assistant Secretary of Affairs for Humanitarian affairs, all this comes under that subject heading and abolish these special assistants. Have Geneva do the work and have Washington have a \u0152 a regular office doing whatever is necessary in the United States, such as you know, budget \u0152 getting \u0152 getting money and so forth. And that was finished in 1990 \u0152 in January of 19 four \u0152 f our \u0152 1974, I finished that particular report. And then I went on a nd was doing \u0152 I think the next one was consular affairs and I was just about finish ed with consular affairs when one day I get a phone call from the refugee office. The deputy to this political appointee was a regular foreign service officer whom I knew, I had contact with. And he calls me and he said, I have a problem. We\u2122ve seen your report and I think it\u2122s great. They thought they were getting to be the assistant secretary job. They were \u0152 they were the biggest one, of course. Anyhow, we tha \u0152 we thought we \u0152 we have a \u0152 we have a problem, our man in Geneva, our \u0152 the head of the office just informed us that he is retiring in August. This is about the fifth \u0152 I think it was the day after the Fourth of July weekend, I\u2122d just come back. And he said, you\u2122re the only one who knows what\u2122s going on out there. How would you like to go to Geneva? And my answer to that, and I remember that to this day and will always remember it, was don\u2122t bother me with details, send five tickets. We had a meeting after that, he explained Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 49to me what this problem was and I said yes, I\u2122ll \u0152 I\u2122ll \u0152 I\u2122ll accept and I\u2122ll go. And six weeks later we were in Geneva and I was running that office. And I\u2122d gotten, of course, I was at the time \u0152 this \u0152 the main job of that particular office really, was handling the Russian refugees that were coming out by about 20 or 30,000 a year. That was the beginning of the \u0152 the major exodus from Russia. What they were doing, and I was doing for the next four years was dealing with the voluntary agencies, HIAS, Tolstoy Foundation, the Internati onal Catholic Migration Commission, the World Council of Church es and many others. The \u0152 the Polish American refugee, or Czech American. All of those, all over Europe. They \u0152 tho \u0152 they were physically receiving these refugees, most of them, of course, Jews. All of them, probably. And were trying to resettle them in Israel, in the U.S., in Australia, wherever. And my job was to make sure that the U.S. money that went to these agencies for handling that, was properly used, that they were doing their job, and make sure that they were doi ng what they were supposed to do in the resettlement process. And I learned a lo t about Russians during that period, and others, but mainly the Russians. Went to one of my jo bs and the family was in Geneva, the kids were in international schools, which was a good experience for them, and my job was making \u0152 reviewin g the budgets, reviewing their budget requests and changing them where it was ne cessary. They were all inflated, of Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 50course, the usual thing. I was the first \u0152 first stop. And \u0152 and actually, physically looking at them, periodically. So every month I would be in one or \u0152 or two, I\u2122d be in \u0152 in \u0152 in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and I\u2122d be in \u0152 in \u0152 in Munich, where many of them were. In Rome, which were the main parts and occasionally in Moscow and then Bucharest, behind the Iron Curtain then, talking to our people. And Turkey is \u0152 it was another place. Italy. Several places in Italy where they \u0152 these people were, and working with them to expedite the process. I had one critical, really critical thing. That was, the Kurds in Iran, Iran would not let them out and it was a long process and finally they wouldn\u2122t let any \u0152 finally they decide that yes, they could leave and so we would \u0152 wanted to send in a plane and they wouldn\u2122t allow us. And the international Red Cross, I invol ved them in it, and the international Red Cross was going to send in a plane and they wouldn\u2122t let them. And finally there was a \u0152 a charter from \u0152 Lufthansa had a charter service and the international Red Cross managed to get one of their planes, and they gave in. Now, these people were to be brought out, the \u0152 they \u0152 ere \u0152 ira \u0152 ara \u0152 Iranians gave in and let them go. The people \u0152 the \u0152 the law, there was a special law that Congress enacted to let these people into the United States but it expired on a certain date, which was about \u0152 we were one day away from that date when the thing \u0152 when the Iranians gave in and the Red Cross took the plane over, got the people up and got them to Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 51Frankfurt. I went to Frankfurt to work with our consulate to make sure that these people get their visas. It was just \u0152 they had to get their passports stamped. That was it. What ha \u0152 wh en they got to the United States was unimportant, but before that date \u0152 oh, this was the day. I get to \u0152 to Frankfurt and they\u2122re processing it, doing a good job, and they still got about a \u0152 about a hundred people at five o\u2122clock in the afternoon, the consul \u0152 the U.S. consul says well, we\u2122re gonna have to continue that tomorrow, we\u2122re going home. I said no, you\u2122re not. He said well, yeah, but you know, the day is over. I said, the law expires at midnight and as far as I\u2122m concerned it\u2122s midnight in Washington , not in Frankfurt . And it is five o\u2122clock and it\u2122s noon, we got 12 hours to go, you\u2122ve got to finish these people. He says no, I can\u2122t do that. I said, I want a lin e to the assistant secretary for consular affairs, whom I knew well. I had done a jo b for her before I left and we had good \u0152 good relationship. And he got \u0152 he says okay, so he got the line through. He couldn\u2122t refuse me, so he got the line. And I talked to the lady and I said, I\u2122ve got a reluctant [indecipherable] I\u2122m \u0152 we\u2122re doing the Kurds , and she said yeah, yeah, how you doing? I said we \u0152 there\u2122s still a bout a hundred left that have not, and \u0152 been visa\u2122d and your man he re wants to go home, he wants to close up. She said, let me have him. I said \u0152 handed him the telephone and I notice his face getting longer and longer and he hung up and he said okay, we\u2122ll work until it\u2122s finished. Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 52Well, by about 10 o\u2122clock that night we were finished. Everybody had their visa, stamped with today\u2122s date \u0152 with that day\u2122 s date and the next day we got them on a plane and sent them to the U.S. But those are the kind of things that you \u0152 the troubleshooting type things that \u0152 that you had to do every once in awhile. Had to intervene in Rome with the Russians. The Russians in \u0152 in \u0152 in Rome were treated very nice, they had them out on the \u0152 on the li \u0152 li \u0152 just like they have in New York, in Brighton Beach, they all live out there. In Rome they had them out on the \u0152 on \u0152 near the Lido someplace \u0152 not Lido, whatever the beach is. Nicely quartered. Then you came into town to \u0152 and HIAS was handling most of the Russians in th \u0152 Rome. And they walked in and he sa id \u0152 and their \u0152 their \u0152 their questions were, where is my money, wher e is my house, where is my servants, where is my wi \u0152 the Russian way. The Russians were used to asking for some \u0152 the government. The government gave them. They were still in that mode. And we had some serious problems there, the peop le were intimidated by them. And I told them, don\u2122t be intimidated, you\u2122ve got \u0152 they had Russian speakers there, and they were \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I told them how \u0152 how to talk to these people. Just yell at them. Tell them to go away, they get nothing. One mo re word out of you and you\u2122re out, you get nothing, you go wherever you want to go. And it \u0152 it worked. It worked, you know. Again, something they were used to. The KGB wasn\u2122t going to be \u0152 talk to Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 53them friendly like, so we weren\u2122t either. They had something coming to them. We told them that no, you don\u2122 t have anything coming to you, we\u2122re giving it to you because we\u2122re good people. And in that particular case, and there were a lot of them there, the word got to all of them, I was the United States government. I represent \u0152 see, those were just an organization. When I came, I was the United States government. Well that \u0152 that made \u0152 that \u0152 that \u0152 that did it. When the government says you gotta be quiet, you\u2122re quiet. So we\u2122re \u0152 you know, it was game playing, but \u0152 it was \u0152 it was acting. I did not go to Hollywood after that. That\u2122s \u0152 you know, experiences like that, that was \u0152 that was my job. And of course I saw a lot of misery too, people coming out and having to sit in those camps in some areas, they were not too pleasant. Some intellectuals, people with \u0152 who had status and \u0152 and now were begging, in eff ect. I felt for them, but on the other hand, I was there too, once, and I knew how they felt. So, you know, you treated them accordingly. You talked to them, and particularly in some cases when I talked to them, I told them who I was, and I said, I was in your position once, and look at me now. It\u2122s gonna happen to you, just take it easy. It\u2122ll be done. We\u2122re doing it, but it takes time. And it helped a little, some cases, I \u0152 I hope it did."

I\u2122d like you to reflect back on some of the things from the 60\u2122s, like the \u0152 the Vietnam war an-and Civil Rights, and Women\u2122s Moveme nt. Did you get involved with any of those, or are any of those of particular interest to you?",
            "answer": "No, I was \u0152 well, put this way. In 1965 \u0152 no, \u212266, I\u2122d just gone to the State Department. No, no, no, fift \u0152 \u212265, I was still with the DIA. I received a letter from the army, saying that the Secretary of Defense has declared your job an essential \u0152 a civilian essential position. Therefore, you can no longer remain in the active reserve. I was still a reserve officer. By th at time I was a lieutenant colonel. And I \u0152 Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 55i \u0152 i \u0152 well, let me just quickly here, when I said I left Korea and we said no thank you, we don\u2122t. When I got back to Washington I applied for commission again. I decided I \u0152 I want to stay in, mainly beca use it \u0152 that pays, at the end. I had never known until 1957, approximately \u212257 is when I came back in, that reserve offices who had active duty at age 60 would get money. And I said well, why not? Somebody talked me into it, really. Somebody told me about that, one of the people I wor \u0152 I worked with. They said, why don\u2122t you come back in, and I went down to Fort Myer(ph) and said, can I come back in? And they said, of course. And I \u0152 I came \u0152 I-I was reassigned on the non-pay unit. We met once every two weeks in the Pentagon for a couple of hours, get a lecture from somebody or gave a lecture. And that was it, we got points, that\u2122s all. So anyhow, in 1965 I got this letter saying that your \u0152 you\u2122re essential now and you can\u2122t be in th e reserves any more, in the active reserve, but you have over 20 years, and so you have a choice to go in the inactive reserve or into retired reserve. And Vietnam was just brewing and I said, I don\u2122t want to get caught in another war. Even \u0152 even then I might \u0152 this \u0152 this thing ad \u0152 ba \u0152 my civilian job might end, and I\u2122ve had two wars, two is enough. And Vietnam didn\u2122t look like anything that I shou ld get involved in. And I said \u0152 I wrote back and said no, put me in the \u0152 in the retired reserve and I retired at that point. And at age 60, the checks started coming, which are s till accepted. But Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 56anyhow, now Vietnam I did not like what was going on. I couldn\u2122t see it. There was \u0152 I didn\u2122t think we had any business th ere. And I had friends who were still in the service who went over there and they came back and they told me what conditions they \u0152 that they had, under what conditions they were there, and it was not what I \u0152 I felt that I was right, we shouldn\u2122t be there. And I had \u0152 I felt for all the people that \u0152 that were against the war and all that, although you know, I was sort of a military something or other, nothing serious. But that wasn\u2122t it and many of the people I knew who were in the military and in the reserves and retired in the reserves all felt like I did, so I-I wasn\u2122t alone. And I \u0152 I \u0152 well, we were right, it came out the wrong way at the end."

It was \u0152 well, it \u0152 it was the homeland for all those who didn\u2122t have a land and a place any more. And what was left of my family was there. My cousin, his mother and father. And then a little later on, another cousin who had survived in Bucharest that I didn\u2122t know about then for \u0152 for some time, til after the war, quite a bit after the war. She came to \u0152 to Israel. So I had direct connection. I also had some friends who had gotten to Israel early in the \u0152 well, some left actually with their families in the 30\u2122s, before the anschluss . And others Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 58had gotten out in the tra \u0152 in the various transports or in the illegal migration. And so \u0152 and of course, they were my people . I watched those wars and I followed them very carefully and was overjoyed with all the results, because each one of them was a victory. I almost got involved directly in \u0152 well, I did get involved in a way, in the Yom Kippur war in \u212273. I was at the synagogue in \u212273 on Yom Kippur, when the thing \u0152 th-the news came. I remember it was in a Sunday, I believe. And I had airline tickets to Israel for Monday. On \u0152 as a job, I was supposed to \u0152 I was still an inspector then, and I was to inspect the immigration policies of Israel, again ka \u0152 that was still during the \u0152 the time when I was working on the \u0152 on the refugee and the humanitarian affairs study. And I was headed for Israel, I was headed for Israel, Lebanon and Jordan. I had two passports in my pocket, one for Israel and one for the other countries, because you co uldn\u2122t have a stamp then, and th-that \u0152 in the State Department we did all kind s of things, you know. Two diplomatic passports and I just hoped that I rememb ered which pocket I had which one in when I pulled it out. But I was to \u0152 to be in Israel on the \u0152 on the f \u0152 the following \u0152 well, I was leaving the following day, the day after Yom Kippur. And of course when I came home that night, I called the State Department. War had broken out and there was no way to go there. And I ca lled the \u0152 the \u0152 the duty officers, and I asked them to get a telegram to our embassy in Tel Aviv that \u0152 and \u0152 and also to Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 59Lebanon and Jordan that because the situation that I was not coming and I\u2122ll let them know when I\u2122m coming, it would be a little later. If I had left a couple days earlier, I would have been right in the mi ddle of \u0152 of a six day war. But I \u0152 the Yom Kippur war, I mean. But I \u0152 I was just save d by \u0152 by one day. I did get there again, oh, about the following month. It was an interesting thing, I had to go to \u0152 to Jordan and there was a \u0152 when I got to Israel I said, well, I\u2122m going to have to go back to Greece and then fly into Jordan . And they said no. Said the Allenby bridge, which is the famous bridge wh ere the crossings occurred, the \u0152 the exchanges and all that. They said, we have a deal with \u0152 Israel really has a deal with Jordan, war or no war. We can get you to the bridge, and on \u0152 it was a certain day, like Tuesday or Wednesday, but the \u0152 one of the officers from \u0152 from Amman is coming to Jerusalem across the bridge, and he \u0152 the embassy will take him in their car to the bridge. They will cross \u0152 he will have to walk across the bridge and we have a car at the bridge to pick him up. So we\u2122ll just tell the embassy in \u0152 we\u2122ll just call Jordan, Amman, and we\u2122ll tell them that you\u2122ll be crossing the bridge at the same time, you\u2122ll be in the car that \u0152 pi ck him up and they co \u0152 they\u2122ll pick you up on the other side. You\u2122re just gonna have to carry a suitcase by yourself across. I said, well that\u2122s no problem. And so that \u2122s how we went a \u0152 went across that bridge. And it was interesting, I got a trip through all of the \u0152 the territories there, Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 60the new territories. Well, they weren\u2122t new any more. But anyhow, got there, got to the bridge, went across. Said hello to the guy who ca \u0152 came in from \u0152 from Jordan . Went across and got in the car and got to the embassy in Jordan . And from there I could go to Lebanon and finished up my trip and then went home. So that was an interesting experience. I didn't expected it to be that way, but I did get to use both of my passports."

We like your report and would you \u0152 how would you like to go and take over in Geneva? And my answer to him was, please don\u2122t bother me with details, send five tickets. And fi \u0152 six weeks later we were in Geneva. I took over that office and we had oh, about 20 or 30 peop le working in there. There\u2122s a lot of bookkeeping \u0152 well, a lot of it was ha-ha ndling the \u0152 well, okay, th \u0152 my \u0152 my duties were representation to the United Nations, to the appropriate offices of the Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 61United Nations, the high commissioner for refugees, the U.N. high commissioner for disaster relief, the international Red Cross and all the other international organizations that had any d ealings with \u0152 with refugees or dis \u0152 or any of the human \u0152 humanitarian affairs, including the human rights. I had one officer assigned to me who was specially doing human rights work. I concentrated on directing the United States refugee program, as it was called, and my job was to see that the U.S. funds that were going into the program were being properly used by the people who were actually operati ng the program. And now those people were voluntary agencies, as we called them. HIAS, International Catholic Migration Commission, World Council of Churches, Polish American, Czech American refugee organizations, Tolstoy Foundation, in \u0152 in \u0152 International Rescue Committee and others. They had places in various parts of Europe, where they would receive the refugees, they would come m \u0152 and those \u0152 this is the period when we had the Russian refugees coming out. They were coming out between 20 and 30,000 a year in those y ears. They would house them, feed them and process them and help them get to their final destination. We tried to get them to Israel but not all of them went. Some \u0152 some went to Israel, others made it to the United States and Australia was another major point. Others stayed in Europe or some in Germany, and various other places. But with all these people there was Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 62the need \u0152 the \u0152 needed money, and the United States supported that. We also supported Israel in the settling of the Russian refugees. We supplied money for the building of housing and teaching them language, teaching and whatever was necessary to ink \u0152 to get them into \u0152 into the main stream. So my job took me to \u0152 to these \u0152 to various places where the \u0152 where the people were being actually processed.

Also, I had to lo ok at their \u0152 their annual budgets when they \u0152 their budgets would co me to me, I would check it to see if it was justified and then pass it on to Washington to present to Congress. I made the first corrections and then Washington cut some more, and whatever. These \u0152 these things happened, of course, it\u2122s the usual w ith the budget process. But the \u0152 the best part of that was I traveled and I \u0152 I saw a lot of these people and my points of travel were what \u0152 Paris, Rome, Vienna, all hardship points \u0152 ports. Munich was a very heavy place, lots \u0152 many of them came through Munich because many of the organizations had their headquarters in Munich for some reason or other. Some came through Frankfurt. And occasionally I would go \u0152 Istanbul was another Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 63one, and occasionally I would go to \u0152 to Bucharest and to Moscow , because \u0152 to talk \u0152 to work with our own people, the embassy people, to find out what the governments are up to and how they are handling \u0152 because they were handling some of the guarantees to the local govern ment that they would be going to the United States and once they got out we tried to get them to \u0152 to Israel. But anyhow, most of that, it was \u0152 was a very interesting job. And having been a refugee once, I \u0152 I could \u0152 I knew what these people were going through, and wherever we could help, I \u0152 I helped."

            "question": "How long did you continue in this position?",
            "answer": "Four years. I was there for exactly four years. My family was with me and the children went to an international school in \u0152 in Geneva . And it was \u0152 it \u0152 it \u0152 it was a dream assignment. I had planned on retiring, I wanted to stay another year, and so I asked \u0152 I put in a request for \u0152 to extend me for one more year. And they came \u0152 Washington came back and said, as a matter of fact, we\u2122ve just cut this down to a three year as \u0152 for your \u0152 your \u0152 the ne xt. There are too many people who want to go to Geneva , so from now on it\u2122s going to be a three year assignment, not a four year assignment, and \u0152 and we can\u2122t extend you for the fifth year. I told them that I would retire, one more year and I retire. So in 1974 in September s \u0152 in \u0152 well, we came home in \u0152 around the first of August. 1974 I had some leave \u0152 \u212278, excuse Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 64me, \u212278. It\u2122s been a few years, but \u212274 is when I got there. Okay, we came home. I had leave and when I got back to work, I was assigned a \u0152 well, I was told that I had a choice of assignments, but my \u0152 my first as-assignment would have been with the new office that I had originally pr \u0152 created in that \u0152 the inspection report that I\u2122d written. The assistant secretary for humanitarian affairs, and I would have been a deputy in there. But I didn\u2122t \u0152 I rejected that because the other person who was in the deputy \u0152 in the assistant secretary\u2122s job, we\u2122ve had some differences, major differences and I wouldn\u2122t work for that person. And so I said no. As it happened, someone else had found out that I was on the way back and had said if possible, could I get assigned to that offi ce, and that was the Office of Consular Affairs, which was the last report I did in \u0152 as a \u0152 an inspector, and \u0152 someone I had dealt with also on refugee affairs and other things. And the \u0152 so I went to that office, and they told me that they had \u0152 wha \u0152 wha -- what my plans were and I said, I plan to retire, I had decided I retire the end of the year. December, I\u2122m through. Got three months, that\u2122s it. And they say well, we just have a job for you, exactly for that. There is a presidential commission on the rewriting of the immigration laws. And we have to send a State Department representative to that. It is \u0152 it is a \u0152 in \u0152 physically locate d in the Justice Department. And how would you like to represent us? And I said, do I know anything about the immigration Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 65laws? They said, of course you do. I said, in that case I\u2122ll \u0152 I\u2122ll go. I took that assignment and I spent most of my next tw o and a half months over at the Justice Department with \u0152 oh, the Justice Depa rtment, the Immigration-Naturalization Department, we went over all the immigration rules and laws and all that to see what would happen, what should be done , and I put in the State Department and put \u0152 which I got from \u0152 from my people, I went back to state, but whenev \u0152 whatever questions came up, I checked with the department, see what their position was and brought it up and we wrote that report, went in \u0152 it was supposed to be finished and to Congress by the end of th e year. We finished up and it was going into the typewriter on about the middle of December, at which time I said goodbye and I left, I never read the report, I never saw it afterwards. I knew what was in there, but it didn\u2122t go anywhere anyway. It was a \u0152 it was as a lot of these reports go, Congress does whatever they want to do. I went back and went through the process, out-processing thing, and then the last day of December, the 30 th of December, last day was a Saturday, I think. So on that Friday I said goodbye to everybody and got a plaque for the wall and hung it on it \u0152 went home, hung it on the wall and it\u2122s been catching dust ever since there. I retired. That was the end of my \u0152 my government career."

            "answer": "My children. I have three sons. Jeff was born in 1978, and well, having once been a medical student, I had an opportunity to read the book again and brush up, because a week before he was born, and he was about due, we had a snowstorm in \u0152 in \u0152 we lived in \u0152 over in the Alexandria area then. And our street, there was a six foot snow drift at the end of the stre et, we were completely snowed in, there was nothing that could go in or out, and we were waiting. And so I was reading the book and said well, if it happens, I think I know what to do. I remembered as a young medical student, as first year me dical students will do, sneak into other classes, I went into one class once where there was \u0152 this was an obstetrics class and they were observing a birth. And so I saw that everything that was going on and I figured I can do that. Of course, I was scared to death, but Jeff was kind enough to wait for another week and by that time this \u0152 the road was cleared. Then four years later Jim came along and David a couple of years after that. I had \u0152 when we went to Switzerland , Jeff was going into his third year of high school, Jim had just finished elementary school and David was going into the fifth grade. No. Yes, yeah, fifth grade. Anyhow, so they went to \u0152 no, he was going into the third grade, excuse me, he was going into the third grade, Jim was going into the \u0152 into th \u0152 Jim was going into the fifth grade. I c \u0152 yeah, gotta figure this out, yeah. I said it went backwards. And they went to an international school, which was very Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 67useful, learned French. Had an interesting one with our youngest one David , who was 10 years old when we got there. And af ter the \u0152 oh, about two-thirds down the first year, the French teacher called me at the office one day and said, you know, I can\u2122t get anything out of David , he doesn\u2122t do his homework, he doesn\u2122t do anything, he won\u2122t say anything. I don\u2122t kn ow what he knows. I said, well, let me talk to him. I came home that day and we lived in an apartment building, it was a \u0152 a block, four buildings around a big park . Was a \u0152 a beautiful thing and the kids were playing soccer down there and all that. And I came home and David was playing down there, they\u2122re playing \u0152 they were playing soccer and I went down into the park and I listened to \u0152 I was looking for David and I hear him talk. And this kid is talking French to his buddies like a native. And so aft \u0152 I let him finish the game and then they \u0152 when he came ups tairs, I said, hey, your French teacher says you\u2122re not doing any work in Fren ch. And he said, yeah, well you \u0152 th-they have all this \u0152 this grammar and I don\u2122t know anything about th at. I said, well, you have to study it. And he said well, but I do n\u2122t need it. I can talk French. I said yeah, I \u0152 I just noticed that. I didn\u2122t know you could I had not noticed that at all. So next day I called the teacher and I told her what he had \u0152 what I-I observed. I said, please engage him in \u0152 in a conversation outside of the classroom and see \u0152 see what he comes up with. She called me that afternoon and she said, forget Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 68everything I said. He\u2122s ok \u0152 I don\u2122t care whether he knows grammar or not. So that was an interesting experience. The other two of course, also learned French and enjoyed \u0152 and first they were a little apprehensive when they got there, because they were in a strange country and it \u0152 this was something new. When it was time to come home, they didn\u2122t want to leave. They were at home there and they had a \u0152 whenever I could \u0152 I told you that I had to travel quite a bit. Whenever I could arrange my travels when the kids were out of school, I would take the family along. And so they got into a lot of places. We got there and I let them go sightseeing or take a tour or whatever and I would be doing my \u0152 my job. And then we\u2122d come back and they had seen anothe r place. We d \u0152 we traveled a lot, they traveled a lot and of course, what they \u0152 what got th em about skiing, maybe I \u0152 did I mention that before when I \u0152 when I came home the day when I got the assignment in Switzerland, I \u0152 I called my wife and told her, Barbara this \u0152 we\u2122re \u0152 we\u2122re going to Switzerland , she said, great. And I said, don\u2122t tell the kids, we\u2122ll tell them tonight. So at dinner we\u2122re sitting around the table and I casually sort of mentioned, listen, how would you like \u0152 how would you guys like it if we got assigned to go to Switzerland? And Jeff, of course who was a \u0152 all \u0152 all the kids were skiers. I was a skier so I \u0152 I taught them early. And I said \u0152 Jeff said oh yeah, yeah, skiing, Switzerland, yeah, that\u2122s it, let\u2122s go. And the other two chimed in, yeah, let\u2122s go. Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 69So, it was no problem. But then when they got there, of course, they were a little apprehensive. We \u0152 when we got back they \u0152 they went back to school. Jeff \u0152 oh Jeff, we bro \u0152 took Jeff back in \u212256. He graduated in 1956 \u0152 \u212276, yeah, 1976."

But is not until about the middle 80\u2122s is Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 71when I \u0152 one day it sort of dawned on me \u0152 that wa \u0152 it came from some questions that I \u0152 a discussion we had with \u0152 with th e kids, that they really didn\u2122t know me. They knew bits and pieces of \u0152 they kn ew who I was. They knew where I came from, they knew what I\u2122d gone through, a little bit.

I went out and I bo ught myself a word processor and I hooked it up and I sat down and I started writing. And I started writing every day from then on until I had it all on paper. And so I \u0152 I wrote my \u0152 my whole history up to that point. There isn\u2122t much after that anyway, they know me since then. And I made copies and they all have a copy of it.

But it is \u0152 other than that, of course there is \u0152 there was the \u0152 the pain. The knowledge that I survived and my family didn\u2122t, has always been with me, it\u2122s never left me in \u0152 not in \u0152 in Korea and not in Tokyo and not of course in \u0152 in \u0152 in Europe. I\u2122ve been looking for the answer, and of course there is no answer. But also I\u2122ve been \u0152 I\u2122ve spent an awful lot of my waking life looking for my parents. There was a big gap there. My parents and \u0152 and the rest of the family, but my \u0152 my mother and my father, of course. And of course that\u2122s \u0152 didn\u2122t come until about three years ago, when I was doing a \u0152 a study on \u0152 on \u0152 in the museum \u0152 in the Holocaust museum, and I was talking to the then head of archives, in a casual conversation, and you know, mentioning th at I had \u0152 who I was and that family was \u0152 was taken to \u0152 deported to \u0152 from Vienna to \u0152 to L\u00f3dz and that\u2122s when I lost the trail. And he s \u0152 he told \u0152 told me th at, he said, we have just gotten these five volumes of \u0152 a register of all the people th at were in the ghetto, have you seen it? I said no, didn\u2122t know anything about it an d we interrupted the \u0152 my interview with him and I went to look at it and I opened it, I asked for the \u0152 there \u0152 it was Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 73alphabetical thing. Apparently the Germ ans had registered all this. Had it in alphabetical order and it was found after th e war, the Polish government had it, and finally got to Yad Vashem and \u0152 and \u0152 and to the mu seum. And I opened it to the S\u2122s and went to Stein and there was my mother and my father and the rest of the family. And I found a \u0152 there was a date when they ar \u0152 wh o they were, their profession, their date of birth, when they arrived in the \u0152 in the ghetto, and when they left the ghetto. Now, the leaving of the ghetto for most of them was later dates, and to my knowledge that was before the \u0152 that was after the Chelmno death camp had been closed, that was the ausch \u0152 they were mostly to Auschwitz then, or other concentration camps. But my parents and some others, I noticed the \u0152 the final depr \u0152 disposition there is a \u0152 it said TR7. I remembered from my readings that there were certain time periods when there were transports to \u0152 to Chelmno. And so right after that I went to looking into some of the other books that I had read that had this thing and then I remembered the first one was Gilbert and I read in there, there were seven transports from the 21st to the 28th of February, 1942 to Chelmno, transport seven was on the 20th of February. That was cl osure to me. I knew on the 27th of \u0152 27th \u0152 28th, excuse me, 28th of February, they had died at Chelmno."

I found not only my Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 77grandfather\u2122s gun, with his name on it and all that, with a label, but also some papers he had apparently given, some pa \u0152 passport \u0152 well, I don\u2122t \u0152 I\u2122m not sure what it \u0152 what it was, I can\u2122t remember. I looked at it afterwards, but I can\u2122t \u0152 but some documents that are also sitting right there. So she found her grandfather there. It was \u0152 it was a heartwarming thing. I had another one, I was loading the elevators, and it was a quiet period, and I had a fam ily coming in around \u0152 what looked like a husband and wife and two gr own children, children in their 20\u2122s. And I directed them to the \u0152 to the I.D. cards and said, pick up an I.D. card. The man picked up an I.D. card, and the next \u0152 I was looking at him, next he said, oh my God. I said, anything wrong? He said no. We are from Holland and I picked a card, this is a person from my town in Holland . I didn't know anybody was in the Holocaust in Holland, in \u0152 from my town. Some small town he lives in. They looked like professional people. But, and I-I-I said, well, th-that\u2122s very unusual. And he said, oh, when I get back I will \u0152 I will give this to the mayor. We will \u0152 I will \u0152 will tell them that we \u0152 we have to do something, you know, a plaque or something for a person ah \u0152 we didn \u0152 I don\u2122t think anybo dy even knows or reme mbers that. I said, that\u2122s wonderful, please do that. And there were several other things like that that happened that are very nice to know. I read \u0152 oh, well, an amazing thing. One day I \u0152 I was \u0152 I was the information desk, and a man walked up to me. And he looks at Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 78me and I looked at him and he \u0152 some [indecipherable] looked familiar, wasn\u2122t sure what it was. He said, you\u2122re Stein. I looked at him. I said, I\u2122ve seen you somewhere, way back. He says, yeah, in [indecipherable] he started speaking German. Somebody I knew in Vienna , and as a matter of fact I also knew him in New York, but we \u0152 he had \u0152 he changed comple \u0152 I-I don\u2122t know, he \u0152 I guess I didn\u2122t change much, but he recognized me. I didn\u2122t recognize him, but I had known him in \u0152 in New York and \u0152 about 1939 \u0152 1940, I guess, and then sort of lost track, I hadn\u2122t seen him since about then \u0152 sinc e then. So we \u0152 we had a long talk. Those are some of the things. Vis-Visitors, I have a \u0152 I have my own personal policy in \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 in visitor services. There\u2122s no German or Austrian that comes to the museum that does not go and see it, I don\u2122t care whether there are tickets or not. I always have some \u0152 my own tickets in my pocket. I always save some for just those. And I\u2122ve had many cases where I \u0152 I th ink they need to go see, see their own history. Not mine, their history, now. And I\u2122ve had some of them come back, f-find me again, look me up and \u0152 and thank me for \u0152 for letting them see. They says, you know, we read a lot about it, we heard a lot about it, but not like this. I said, that\u2122s right. It\u2122s all there. I enjoy working with groups, school groups mostly, where we go a little deeper into the \u0152 the subject matter, and I\u2122m particularly i-interested in the questions the kids ask. And some of them are good. And then I have right now Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 79still \u0152 still there from last year, so I guess two years now, the artwork down at the elevator, the basement \u0152 the concourse elevator. The first thing as you walk in on the left hand side is that large picture of the police station in Vienna , the one I lived next door to. The one I\u2122ve been in. And so, after we \u0152 I tell them all about the museum, I say, well while you\u2122re waiting for th e elevator, take a look at this one. It might give you something a little personal. I was in that police station, I lived right next door to it. I been in there many times before the Germans moved in and after the Germans moved in, I was in there asking for permission to leave the country. And then I get all kinds of questions. Oh, were you there, oh. And, you know. The elevators, fortunately take a long time to come down to \u0152 to the concourse and so we got \u0152 have time to answer those ques tions. Makes an impression, and it gives them one more dimension to [indecipherable] . I also \u0152 I s \u0152 I \u0152 excuse me, I started this program, which they are n \u0152 are now continuing, o-of the \u0152 when I was on the \u0152 on the [indecipherable] of taking people through and having survivors telling their stories at certain places that they\u2122re particularly \u0152 that they\u2122re \u0152 were involved in. And I just saw in those latest \u0152 you may have seen that \u0152 that they \u0152 Pete Philips is now going to do it this fall again for th-the paid staff of visitor services. And they need it. Paid staff is, you know, they\u2122re \u0152 they\u2122re the most temporary employees \u0152 o-of visitor servic es, are the most temporaries i-in the Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 80museum. They come in, it\u2122s their first job after college and they can\u2122t wait to get their one year in to get status to apply for another job somewhere, because they\u2122re not paying them. The pay is \u0152 is ridiculous. And so they\u2122re not putting heart and soul into it like we do."

It was dormant too long, and of co urse in my own case, in Austria, the Austrians never considered themselves as the first victims until what, 1992 or \u212293 when Chancellor Vranitzky said hey, let\u2122s forget about that, we\u2122re just as guilty as the rest of them.
