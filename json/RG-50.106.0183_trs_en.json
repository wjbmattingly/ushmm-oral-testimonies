And my maternal grandmother, as I said, lived across the street and I remember I went often over there to school. She was, used to fix my omelets, fried in o11, which seemed to be delicious at the time. For some reason my paternal grandmother, very sweet little woman. I remember her, but I don\u2019t remember where she was and where she lived. So perhaps she didn\u2019t live in Brussels."

And I remember we finally got our own bathroom, because we didn\u2019t have one for the longest time. Not a bathtub, I meant my \u2014 because, no because I think, if I remember clearly, we used to go to what would you call them."

But you know there was a sense of peace, really I do remember that. We never complained about being hungry. Mother must have had the family over because there was always more than the four of us but I do remember Passovers. I https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 7 do remember Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur because the women and the men sat separately. Mama and I sat upstairs, while Papa and my brother were downstairs. And I do remember my brother\u2019s bar mitzvah, how he used to have a rabbi that used to come in and tutor him but not me. Girls were not as important at that time. Really. We thought that was very interesting. Now I think that\u2019s very interesting because he could read Hebrew and he had a good understanding even when he got married with his family and I never did. Until I was bas mitzvahed."

It was mostly academic at that time because I remember I had a Latin teacher already because she would -- I remember one thing about her. She read palms. And she read my palm. This was before the war. She said I would have a very short life and she was very -- and you know that stayed with me my whole life. And now that Pm 84 I\u2019m all right."

There were Germans who were fleeing German Jews who were leaving Germany to try to get to Israel and other parts of the world. They would come through Belgium. And I remember that we had some of them for dinner. Now how they came to my mother and dad\u2019s house. There must have been an organization that placed them in different homes for dinner, for hospitality. And I do remember that. And that was the only way I knew, and not realizing what the problem was because I really wasn\u2019t included in the conversation. But I do remember that there were German Jews who had run away from Germany and they were talking about some of the problems I\u2019m sure. At that time. But there were many Jews who didn\u2019t believe that they would be touched. And obviously my parents didn\u2019t either because they waited until the Germans attacked Belgium. But my father was very wise. We didn\u2019t find that out until we were here. And I didn\u2019t find that out until, before my brother died, that my father in the 30s wired $10,000 to the Chase Bank in New York. And that money was here when we came to the United States. That was very wise of him. And $10,000 was a lot of money at that time."

            "answer": "I might have heard the name but I think I was protected from hearing too much being afraid about too much, because again the atmosphere and the thought must have been at that time that it wasn\u2019t going to be so easy for the Nazis to overtake Europe the way they did.

We were arrested by the French and we were put in prison, right there in St. Gaudens. I always had the impression that it was because mother\u2019s little town of Biala Podlaska might have been on the border between Russia and Poland. And perhaps at that time there were bad feelings between France and Russia. I\u2019m not sure. Or we might have been arrested because you know this was the Vichy government and perhaps that they were already working with the Nazis. Because the Nazis were really being very clever I think now that I think about it. They didn\u2019t want to do too much to the Jews because they wanted the Jews to come back to where they were living before, because for the longest time you would hear rumors. Come back to Brussels. They are not touching anybody. They are not doing anything to anybody so my mother probably in 1941 and because she was a woman she smuggled herself back to Belgium. And she did salvage some of the jewelry you know. And she brought back her Sabbath candles which I have. She brought back my father\u2019s tallis ,which I have and she brought back my father\u2019s tfillin, the tfillin, which I still have also. But she brought her diamonds, her jewelry.

So my father went to Toulouse which was not too far away and that\u2019s where the consulate was. And he would stay every day in front of the consulate to see if there was any news. And they would have ways really of arresting people for what reason I don\u2019t know, because I remember my father telling me that he would hear the whistles blow and he would run. But he would go back again in a day or two to see because of course we couldn\u2019t leave without a sponsor. And we finally got the papers in 1942."

The four sisters would get together with their children and bring food or whatever and meet on Sundays and then go back home. So on one Sunday I went with the family to Athens. And there was my husband Reuben. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 39 And the story is that he fell in love with me. The moment he saw me (laughs). And it was interesting actually. We didn\u2019t date very much. My mother was very anxious for me to get married. I was already 20 and 21 and I wasn\u2019t married yet. So there was an engagement party in McKeesport Pennsylvania for my brother and his future wife. And Reuben decided to come and we talked and then I went to New York with my father. I remember to cause he was going to Columbia law school. And I went to New York with my dad to help him buy inventory. And I met with Reuben again and he asked me to marry him.

Managed, we built such a successful organization, we managed to raise over the years that we were together about a million and a half and we renovated several floors really in the home. And I was president, I really loved it at the time. I did that in honor of my mother and father who both were in the home. I also was bas mitzvahed in 1992. In honor of my dad cause he had died and I wanted to do that for him.

And that was the end of the hametz [ph]. After that we started Passover. And you know I think it is so wonderful to keep up those traditions because it stays in the mind of children. Those are the things that really remain with them and how important it is. And I do think today that the Jewish institutions are trying to https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Regine Ginsberg 52 go back to that.

There is no other country in the world, no other country in the world where you can live and allowed to live the way you live in this country. And I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I\u2019ve always appreciated that from the moment I set foot in this country because I\u2019ve had a wonderful life here. I\u2019ve lived in a part of the country that has been hospitable, that it was just a joy. And when I hear some of the things that are going on now I just can\u2019t understand it.

It was ignored all over the world, what was happening. In the camps and during the war. Or the soldiers wouldn\u2019t have act so amazed when they opened the doors. They didn\u2019t know. And it was interesting yesterday to read Eisenhower\u2019s comment really, this is \u2014 and I was so delighted to see so many children standing in a line and there was heartfelt thought to see a couple of young kids crying, actually crying yesterday and this is good, this is good. And I didn\u2019t know that you have such an attendance. I mean it\u2019s constant. And I think that\u2019s great, I really do. In fact I think I\u2019m going to become a member of this one too.
