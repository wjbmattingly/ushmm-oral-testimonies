You know how kids play after school. And we never talked about it, but when the da -- Germans came, I guess that it was entirely different. They used to sell a Jew for a pound of salt, a pound of sugar, of -- a pack of cigarettes, they used to point out the Jew. And the Germans, with the help of the Ukrainian police, and Lithuanian police, used to come in and take them away. It was entirely different. We didn\u2019t -- we\u2019d never expected that, but look, life changes. You can see it now, how countries change. It\u2019s still going on, they -- they still didn\u2019t learn from the fir -- the second World War and it\u2019s still going on in Bosnia and previous Czechoslovakia and in th-the African countries, they kill each other.
