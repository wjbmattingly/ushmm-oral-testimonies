It is very important, first of all, that we tell the story and number two, although they learn in the school about the Holocaust, and they see maybe pictures, they let them read some books, but it\u2019s different when you see a live person, from his own experience, tells the story. And I think it makes some impression on them, because usually, after we spoke in a school, I assume it is an assignment from the teacher that tells them to write about the -- the impression that we were there. And the letters are very, very, very interesting. [indecipherable] Now, a matter of fact, one -- one -- usually the children write the letters. One -- one these letters weret -- one\u2019s from a mother has written us a letter and she says in the letter, this says, \u201cWhen my son comes home from school, I ask him, \u201cHow was school today?\u201d He said, \u201cAh,\u201d just [indecipherable] and said, \u201cAh.\u201d This time, after we spoke there, he came back, he didn\u2019t wait even for the question, he said, \u201cOh, you know, 8 today we had some people from the concentration camp and it made so much big impression on me.\u201d\u201d\u2019 She was so ex-ex-ex-excited about it, tells us the story. So I think, some expresses more than the other, but I think 50 - 70 percent, 1t makes an impression. They will remember always, they will tell always, if somebody denies the story, they will always know to remember, when I was young, there was somebody what was there, he told us our story. So we find it very rewarding for that reason alone. Is it one percent of two percent, that it leaves some impression on them. So I think that\u2019s the reason we go really talking on school. "
