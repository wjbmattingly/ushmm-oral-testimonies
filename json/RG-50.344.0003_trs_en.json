And so the superintendent says, \u201cWell, we have a nurses training school here. Why don\u2019t you have your daughter come and enter our class?\u201d And that was around October, November. So my father came home and told me that and I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure the classes started in September and I would be two months later and I\u2019d never be able to catch up.\u201d So he -- so my father says, \u201cWell, I pass by King\u2019s County Hospital when I go to Brooklyn State,\u201d cause he went on the subway.

The whole time we were in Europe, until we got to Linz, we lived in these squad tents and they were always five or six of us in a tent. And when we were in England we lived in one house and we had to fit into that house. There were always quite a number of us in each room. So, you grew to be very close. I think if we probably all had our own rooms -- and yet, in my nurses training we had our own rooms and my class 1s still very close. We still -- in fact I go to all my -- my King\u2019s County luncheons. We have one in Pennsylvania and we have Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 29 July 14, 1995 one in New York City. I go to both of them. But most of the girls go to the one in Pennsylvania. So most of them have moved out of New York and live there in Pennsylvania.

And then you wash it and put it together again. Well, he came on duty and he hung, I guess, a jacket and -- and his meat can on the back of a door -- happened to be a hook there. Well -- and then he came to me and he told me in German that his meat can was gone. And I said, \u201cAre you sure you left it there?\u201d And, yeah. So I started looking under everybody\u2019s pillow. And I\u2019m climbing on all these tiers and looking under. I finally found it. My God, he was practically kneeling every time I Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 36 July 14, 1995 passed him. Cause he told me he\u2019d be killed if he -- 1f it was found out that he lost it. Oh, he was so frightened, oh. Which 1s why I really worked very hard to find it. And I did find it. Oh, he was frantic. He was just a kid, you know. And we had German prisoners of war when I was at Fort Dupont and I had some funny experiences with them, too."

            "question": "Before you went overseas?",
            "answer": "Before I went over. You know, we had 10,000 prisoners there at Fort Dupont and when we were on night duty, we worked from seven pm to seven am, 12 hours. And then you got an extra day off for that. You did that for two weeks. So the prisoners, when they -- when we were preparing for them, we had just a very small hospital with three wards and s -- and some private rooms. And the prisoners of war were at least a mile away. We had quite a big hospital there, but it was empty. So they put their ward as far away as you could go. How I wished I had roller skates. Cause you had to go down there and gave out -- you put out the medicines. I put them in all little medicine glasses with the name of the person. Cause we had a ward man who was German. He gave out all the medicines, he did everything except the narcotics and the injections. So he called me one night, 1t was pouring rain and he said, \u201cWe\u2019re being flooded down here.\u201d And -- because I could understand him, you see? And so -- and -- and one of the duties of the night nurse was to run across an open ramp into the nurses quarters and close all the windows. And we had these rainstorms that came up in Delaware in a second. And it just came down, you can\u2019t imagine. And so I had just come back from the nurses quarters -- you ran into everybody\u2019s room, closing windows -- and the telephone call came in. So I ran down Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 37 July 14, 1995 there and they had a guard and he had a whole ring, like this, of keys. And -- and he -- well, anyhow, I said, \u201cI got to find out what\u2019s happening in here.\u201d So I got in there and they had all the beds pulled to the center and the floor was wet. There were a couple of inches of water on the floors and everything, the bed linen was wet. I know I had to go back and get more bed linen, cause they didn\u2019t have enough, because they didn\u2019t use that much, you know, at one time. And -- and they got me a chair -- oh, and we had bars on all the windows. Not regular bars, but screening, that metal screening, each one with a lock and they were not in succession. So I\u2019m looking for the key, got that window open, opened it, they close it, we locked that again. Go to the next window. By then somebody moved the chair, I got up on the chair, got that window o -- closed -- and the next one. So finally I said, \u201cFor heavens sakes, will you find the right key? Go down while I\u2019m working on this window and you get that lock for that window.\u201d Well, and we had one window next to another, we must have had 40 windows on that ward. Well, I can tell you, about -- af -- seven o\u2019clock in the morning I was down in the office of the man that was in charge of that. And he got a -- heard from me. I says, \u201cThere 1s absolutely no sense to what you people have done.\u201d I said, \u201cFirst of all, you don\u2019t need those metal screens on those windows, that\u2019s asinine.\u201d I said, \u201cAnd if they get out of the window, how are they going to go further?\u201d Because there were big bars and sc -- that curly --"

Everything was off those windows. That I remember vividly. Well, anyhow, while I was jumping from one chair to the other, one of them says, in German, he said, \u201cShe\u2019s like the little old lady who lived in a shoe, she had so many children, she didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Well, I burst out laughing, I couldn\u2019t help it. And I was supposed to be very stern, you see, they were our enemies. But I just couldn\u2019t -- they were all young people, you know. I couldn\u2019t help it. I was accused of being too friendly. I couldn\u2019t help it. I was going with a fellow then and he said, \u201cThe word 1s that you\u2019re too friendly.\u201d I says, \u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d I said, \u201cThey\u2019re nice young men.\u201d Most of them were very young. And there was one fellow that had -- had -- I think he had his appendix out. And -- and they -- they get morphine, you know, every four hours if they need it. So I prepared, up at my place -- we kept the -- the morphine and those drugs, you know, they didn\u2019t have them down there. So I went down with my syringe and -- course Hans, as I remember, had called me and said he was in terrible pain. So I went down and the poor fellow, when he saw me, the sweat started coming and he was in awful pain. He -- and he\u2019s inching away back toward the wall. He saw me with the syringe and I remember Hans said, \u201cHe\u2019s -- he thinks you\u2019re going to kill him. Put him to sleep or something.\u201d So I\u2019m trying to tell him, you know, this is for -- to help him. See, they were so -- so -- I mean the tales that we heard on our side, they also heard against us. So anyhow -- so I finally got him -- gave it to him. He was almost fighting me, you know. And he was in terrible pain. It was probably gas. Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 39 July 14, 1995"
