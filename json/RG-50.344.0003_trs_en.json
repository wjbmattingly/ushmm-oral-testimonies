So he knew the superintendent quite well, so he told him about his daughter, who was having trouble finding a job. But eventually, you know, I was working. Just doing file clerk work. And so the superintendent says, \ufb01Well, we have a nurses training school here. Why don\u2122t you have your daughter come and enter our class?\ufb02 And that was around October, November. So my father came home and told me that and I said, \ufb01Well, I\u2122m sure the classes started in September and I would be two months later and I\u2122d never be able to catch up.\ufb02 So he -- so my father says, \ufb01Well, I pass by King\u2122s County Hospital when I go to Brooklyn State,\ufb02 cause he went on the subway. And so I wrote to -- to King\u2122s County and applied and they sent me a ll the applications and whatnot. Now, they took classes twice a year and their next class was the first of February.

And we went to the travelers agency that is supposed to help travelers. They didn\u2122t know a thing about Fort Dupont. And they were there really to help people in the service. Didn\u2122t know anything about their bus service. Well finally, as I recall, somebody overheard us. Must have been a soldier and he said, oh yes, there was a bus around six o\u2122clock at night, something like that and he told us where to go. So we ended up at Fort Dupont, we didn\u2122t have any supper and we were just exhausted. And -- and the chief nurse just act as if we were arriving at eight o\u2122clock in the morning and I thought she was going to put us on duty right away. But she finally let us go and showed us our rooms and -- and that led -- that was my first day of army experience and it wa s really, really -- it wasn\u2122t very pleasant.

So, I mean, even if you took a bath twice a week, at least you -- you got a good one when you -- if you got there first.

It frightened him Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 22 July 14, 1995 so, that he just ran and of course there was nothing to stop him. Ended up in the river and she and the horse drowned. Now we were talking about that earlier today and they said they thought that the nun had some children in the -- orphans or something. I says, \ufb01I don\u2122t ever remember hearing that.\ufb02 But I know then -- and they finally found her and the horse. The horse, they let him just go, he was already gone. But she was drowned.

The whole time we were in Europe, until we got to Linz, we lived in these squad tents and they were always five or six of us in a tent. And when we were in England we lived in one house and we had to fit into that house. There were always quite a number of us in each room. So, you grew to be very close. I think if we probably all had our own rooms -- and yet, in my nurses training we had our own rooms and my class is still very close. We still -- in fact I go to all my -- my King\u2122s County luncheons. We have one in Pennsylvania and we have Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 29 July 14, 1995 one in New York City. I go to both of them. But most of the girls go to the one in Pennsylvania. So most of them have moved out of New York and live there in Pennsylvania. So -- but I think it\u2122s the living closene -- and we all got along very well together. I really don\u2122t know of any enmity between anybody. You know, ruffled feelings or anything. I think we\u2122ve always gotten together. But I really -- I think I s -- have to pat myself on the back, because I think I started having us get together. And there was a -- in 1947, that was the big snowstorm and I had arranged for us to have luncheon down at a Candlelight restaurant in Brooklyn Heights, which was a lovely restaurant in a brownstone, and they gave you popovers -- the whol -- the whole dinner they kept coming out of the oven with these delicious popovers and -- and we had this get together and -- with the storm that we had, two people came down from Syracuse, Phyllis Law was one of them and Loreena, who passed away, was the other one. And Loreena says, \ufb01I was so amazed to see all that snow, because Syracuse has the snow usually.\ufb02 But they didn\u2122t have it and we were just snowed in.

And then you got an extra day off for that. You did that for two weeks. So the prisoners, when they -- when we were preparing for them, we had just a very small hospital with three wards and s -- and some private rooms. And th e prisoners of war were at least a mile away. We had quite a big hospital there, but it was empty. So they put their ward as far away as you could go. How I wished I had roller skates. Cause you had to go down there and gave out -- you put out the medicines. I put them in all little medicine glasses with the name of the person. Cause we had a ward man who was German. He gave out all the medicines, he did everything except the narco tics and the injections. So he called me one night, it was pouring rain and he said, \ufb01We\u2122re being flooded down here.\ufb02 And -- because I could understand him, you see? And so -- and -- and one of the duties of the night nurse was to run across an open ramp into the nur ses quarters and close all the windows. And we had these rainstorms that came up in Delaware in a second. And it just came down, you can\u2122t imagine. And so I had just come back from the nurses quarters -- you ran into everybody\u2122s room, closing windows -- and the telephone call came in. So I ran down Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 37 July 14, 1995 there and they had a guard and he had a whole ring, like this, of keys. And -- and he -- well, anyhow, I said, \ufb01I got to find out what\u2122s happening in here.\ufb02 So I got in there and they had all the beds pulled to the center and the floor was wet. There were a couple of inches of water on the floors and everything, the bed linen was wet. I know I had to go back and get more bed linen, cause they didn\u2122 t have enough, because they didn\u2122t use that much, you know, at one time. And -- and they got me a chair -- oh, and we had bars on all the windows. Not regular bars, but screening, that metal screening, each one with a lock and they were not in succession. So I\u2122m looking for the key, got that window open, opened it, they close it, we locked that again. Go to the next window. By then somebody moved the chair, I got up on the chair, got that window o -- closed -- and the next one. So finally I said, \ufb01For heavens sakes, will you find the right key? Go down while I\u2122m working on this window and you get that lock for that window.\ufb02 Well, and we had one window next to another, we must have ha d 40 windows on that ward. Well, I can tell you, about -- af -- seven o\u2122clock in the morni ng I was down in the office of the man that was in charge of that. And he got a -- heard from me. I says, \ufb01There is absolutely no sense to what you people have done.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01First of all, you don\u2122t need those metal screens on those windows, that\u2122s asinine.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01And if they get out of the window, how are they going to go further?\ufb02 Because there were big bars and sc -- that curly --"

So I went down and the poor fellow, when he saw me, the sweat started coming and he was in awful pain. He -- and he\u2122s inching away back toward the wall.
