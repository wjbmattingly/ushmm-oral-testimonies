The other two were ser -- praying in the back seat and the girl in the front seat was hanging on and all of a sudden we went right off -- it was an -- a big apple tree in this curve and we went right over -- sailed right over that apple tree and landed right down in -- a -- over a bank, I don\u2122t remember how deep it was. The girl in the front seat -- well, the driver was flopped out and he was all right, he was drunk. The girl in the front seat hit the windshield, she had a concussion. One of the girls in the back seat had a long gash in her leg and she was tied up under the Jeep. The other girl -- I don\u2122t know -- I don\u2122t remember what damage she had, but she and the other were under the back seats.

Lady Feldhusen Interview with Phyllis Law 21 July 15, 1995 was one of the group that came back and f ound us. And to this day, they never put anything in the records. This makes us very unhappy. But, like I say, we were laid up then, taken back to the clinic and fixed up and taken up to our quarters, where we laid, side by side on cots in one room. Were ta ken down to meals, they came and sent a truck up and we were taken down to meals at the camp and then brought back home again and that\u2122s where we were until we came home. And then they told me -- I was on crutches and they told me that if I didn\u2122 t throw the crutches away, I had to stay over there. Well, the rest of the group were coming home and one of the girls husband was over there, so she was going to stay. That was all right with her, but I wanted to come home. So I threw the crutches away and hobbled onto the ship when they finally got there. They were assigned to come home. They thought they were going to fly us home, but then something happened to the plane, so they brought us home by train, across the continent, in wooden -- wooden bench trains with no windows. And we slept on th-those overnight, you know, on the trips. And we stopped along the way and got our meals at a -- a tent camp, where they had food set up. Raining, pitchforks and hammer handles and your tray was full of pe aches and mashed potatoes and whatever, all mixed up together and hailstorms and the tents were full of holes. I\u2122ll never forget it. And I\u2122ve forgotten how many days we we re coming across. Then they camped us on the banks of the Seine and that wasn\u2122t very -- very nice camp, but it was just a holding camp. And some of the boys from another outfit felt sorry for the nurses, so Interview with Phyllis Law 22 July 15, 1995 they invited us that -- to come over to Deauville, which was a resort, you know, originally and probably still is -- and spend some time over there in a hotel, so we had -- we spent some time in the hotel in the swimming areas and so forth, so we had a good time there -- until we were -- actually til we were aboard ships -- and aboard ship and we were sent a Navy ship, US Navy, Bliss and we had ice cream and everything we wanted coming home, nice clean sheets and everything, til we landed in Boston.
