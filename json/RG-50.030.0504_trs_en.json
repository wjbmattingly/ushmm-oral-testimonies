Right after he came home the word came out that Jews are not allowed to go to public school any more. So they kept me home, my parents kept me home. Mr. Thiel, when he saw me on the street afterwards, would stop his -- jump off his bike, he used to travel around bike, and see how I was doing. And when my birthday came around, he came to our house to bring all the papers, and all the books that I had. And he told my mother he was so glad that I didn\u2019t show up that day because the principal sent somebody in, you\u2019ve got the only Jew in the whole school, send him home.

This was weird to see. Then you saw the rickshaws, where a man actually pulling a little wagon all along the street. And then the poverty, the beggars on the street, crippled to some degree, trying to beg stuff. And Mrs. Ritter had a sister who was in Shanghai already, they actually were there to welcome us. They said, well most of the refugees are moving into the Hongkew area. Hongkew was a part of Shanghai that had been devastated during the war between the Japanese and the Chinese. Many refugees, most refugees ended up there and started to rebuild the area. People were put into what was referred to as homes. One room per family, large rooms where people were living together. And everybody warned us against that, so this is where we didn\u2019t want to go.

I went to school, and the kids, did you hear the bombardment, the Japanese are taking over. We got called into the auditorium, the principal told us about Pearl Harbor and that the Japanese at this moment are taking over the rest of the city. As he is speaking, we hear troops marching by the school, Japanese troops were marching by, occupying the Marine barracks across the street from us. And I still recall seeing the ja -- the American flag go down and the Japanese flag go up over the Marine barracks. And then they send us all home. By the time I ca -- came home, a kid a year or two younger than I had gotten home a few minutes before me, he told my parents and his parents all kinds of stories, they couldn't make heads or tails out of him, he was so nervous. I was the first one to tell them about Pearl Harbor and the Japanese taking over. In this time they worried sick about my brother."

Everybody from the east is coming west.\u201d My mother said, 5 \u201cWell, all these years, with all that went on, I want to get back and at least be with my brother.\u201d So we came to Baltimore, we settled down a little bit, and they tell us that they are planning to move to San Francisco. My mother was furious. You could have told us that ahead of time, we would have stayed in San Francisco, the -- I forgot what their name was -- told us to just stay there. Anyhow, they decided to go there, first their son, and then they. And my uncle couldn\u2019t find a job. So after awhile they came back to Baltimore. In the meantime we had really settled down extremely rapidly. I had a nice job, maybe it wasn\u2019t paying a fortune, but more than minimum wage.
