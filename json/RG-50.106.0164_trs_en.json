            "question": "No, how long they had been in Trieste.",
            "answer": "Well, in Trieste from \u201922 to \u201927, because my father was working -- he was an engineer, electrical engineer, and he was working with the shipyards in Monfalcone. And when it were -- he was transfers to Fiume, which now 1s Rijeka. We moved to Fiume when I was about five years old. And we lived in Fiume until 1945, until the end of the war. And Father worked there, he was a chief -- he was the director of the electrical department of the shipyard. Can-Cantieri Navale del Quarnaro, where they were building all kind of ships, from submarines, even to the yacht for Mussolini they built, which was never delivered. And he was in charge of -- not only of the projects for the electrical equipment on the ships, but also of the -- care of the cranes and all the electrical equipment of the shipyard itself. And practically I was born with fascism, grew under Interview with Thea Rips \u00b0 January 20, 2004 fascism, without realizing -- it wa -- it w -- 1t was normal for -- for s -- my life. And we went to school. Then they came when -- when we went to school. Of course, we were all supposed to be piccolo Italiani, small, little Italians, because otherwise the schools -- apparently we were not able to go to school, as far as I know. I never realized that, of course. And I went through the whole system until I finished the -- what we call senior high school. Actually it is the Liceo Scientifico, Scientific Lyceum, which is practically comparable to the -- to here -- even though it was only four year. Four year of junior high and four years of senior high. The junior high I went to the technical institute. The senior high I went to the Liceo Scientifico. But as far as education, they told me it\u2019s comparable, when you finish Liceo Scientific -- Scientifico, excuse me, like two years of college in this country, because we had very thorough, you know, the education in Europe. And that\u2019s it. My father continued to work. H-He was never a -- a -- a carda -- a card holding fascist. He became -- he had to become or -- or -- a member of the fascist party in 1942, because otherwise he would have lost his job and h-he had responsibilities [indecipherable]. He had trouble because he didn\u2019t want to wear the uniform, and he never had a uniform and he never wore the black tie -- the -- the black shirt. But you know, they were, with the exceptions of few fanat -- a few -- several fanatics, the population was a strange population in Fiume because they were open-minded on one side and fascist on the other side because after the first World War, Fiume was next to Italy only in 1924, after the famous DiNunzio coup. Apparently th-the Italians didn\u2019t Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Thea Rips , January 20, 2004 want them, but they felt and they are still feel f -- extremely Italian, even though the population was mixed and the ch -- the city was occupied by everybody, from the Espaniards to the st -- Napoleon, th-the Venetians. It started as an Roman colony and -- but they were always, who knows why, very deeply, they felt deeply Italian. And so that\u2019s why they accepted DiNunzio. So DiNunzio and Mussolini, even though they didn\u2019t like each other very, very much, I must say -- for awhile they did, but then -- you see, they connected their fact that they were -- that they could join the Italian, they were admitted to be Italians betwe -- to DiNunzio and to Mussolini. So they felt in that fak -- ka -- in that sense they felt that they were fascists. Fascists because th -- fascism permitted them to be Italians, you know? The city was [indecipherable] after. And that\u2019s it. I tell you also another thing, that this city which was extremely wealthy, small city, we ended up with 45,000 people, but we were much smaller when I was little, had many plans, many industries. It had the torpedo plant, it had th-the shipyards, it had the oil refinery. It had heavy machinery plant, it had mills, and it -- ab-absolutely everything, and the population, the workers were very well off. They had nice houses, we were going skiing together at the engineers -- th-th-th-the director, with the son of th-the -- th-th-th- th-the -- of -- of everybody. We were really a str -- strong community. We were playing tennis together with the children of the workers and so on. So much so that we had a limited number of poor, who were known all by name, you see. And there was a very important Jewish community, Ashkenazi, coming from the east, from the Balkans, from Interview with Thea Rips , January 20, 2004 Germany. | don\u2019t think there was a single Sephardic Jew, as far as I can remember. And we had in Villa Firenze where we lived, among the other places, just across of it, a beautiful, beautiful, three domed synagogue with the cupolas covered with copper tiles. It was really beautiful. And living across the street from them, you see -- we were always saying, oh, d -- you know, they were th-the -- the real Orthodox Jews, the one with the curls and the -- and the fur k -- and the hats with the fur around it, you see. And we were s -- and -- and they were telling us, you know -- we were children, we were -- we were actually not so much children al-already, they were saying, oh well we cou -- we cannot go in there, we cannot go in there, because you know, we -- they don\u2019t allow us to go there and who knows what\u2019s going on there? But I never heard about -- people talking about blood sacrifices or things like this because they were -- we were so interwined that even then there were not many, but there were several mixed marriages at the time. And in my case, for instance, I found -- I found out that some of my schoolmates in -- in school were Jewish because they were allowed, on the Sabbath -- because at the time we were going to school also on s -- on Saturday -- on the Sabbath they were not going to school, but they were justified. They were allowed not to come, because until the racial laws were applied, unfortunately, there was no problem. And -- and -- and -- and we were going -- Jewish kids and non-Jewish kids and Protestant kids, we were all together, we couldn\u2019t care less about religion, o-or wherever they were coming from. And that was it. So, what did I say? And I remember, of all these other people, there was a -- a v -- a very Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Thea Rips \u00b0 January 20, 2004 interesting man, a -- a Jew, Mr. Tannenbaum, ma -- mister -- well fa -- probably Mr. Tannenbaum, for us he\u2019s -- it looked like -- like a -- like a priest or something, because [indecipherable] we know, with the black caftan and the hat with the fur around. He was the sweetest man in the world. My father knew him well. He didn\u2019t come to our house often, but he was going around the house of people he knew, he was friendly. He was collecting money for charities. But charities not for the Jewish population, for everybody who was born in town. He was well known for that. Then, of course, he disappeared. Life was very comfortable in Fiume, very comfortable. Every year we were going to a [speaks Italian here]. And th-there I met a-another group of -- I had this group of Jewish friends tha -- the Lagers, Bondy and Kathy Lager, his bra -- his cousin, and we were all having fun going to the ocean together [indecipherable] this or that. And I remember they were already on guard in the sense that while we kind of ignored the musics from America, jazz, the [indecipherable] they already heard, may-maybe because they had relatives here or something, I don\u2019t know for sure. But anyhow, they were bringing this music and we learned jazz through these Jewish friends of ours, you know. They were really fantastic. I remember that Bondy Lager was very much in love with me. An-And I met Bondy when I first came here in \u201955, and he was married to an Austrian girl -- Jewish girl, and he had a child. And we met in -- in New York where he had a plant or -- or -- or a store -- 0-of t-toys for -- and it -- 1t was very emotional, you know. After so many years, you know I call, who\u2019s there? He says, B-Bondy\u2019s there. Also because when Interview with Thea Rips \u00b0 January 20, 2004 Bondy escaped from Fiume in -- just as -- with the last boat which left Naple, it must have been 1940, his parents remained in Fiume. They were merchants and they had a deposit with they had all kind of food, the potatoes, all kind of thing. Th-The parents remained in Fiume, but Bondy and his sister came to the States. And they left from Naples. And when they left Fiume by train to go to Naples, my sister and myself went to the train to say goodbye. And the funny thing 1s that since at that time I was young and I had many boys at the same time growing around me, my sister was saying, you know, yi- there 1s like a -- like a-a -- a torta, a -- a cake. All the flies go to hel -- you know? So that when Bondy was writing to me, he was saying lot of love to the torta, you know [indecipherable]. Well, that was the story of Bondy. His -- his cousin went to Milan, h- he\u2019s -- hid in Milan, the -- Lazi, because they were of Hungarian descent, that Lazi -- Ladizlow, and -- and he was all right. Then what happened with this? The anschluss, yes, there\u2019s -- now we come to the real s -- thing, which is important."

No, first I think it was Lloyd Triestino, and then Lloyd Adriatico. And he traveled a lot to the Orient, so much so that the house of my grandparents had a lot of Oriental stuff, which like stupid we broke, and not only if we had not broken, we had to leave there when we escaped as refugees, so it was all lost.

When Mussolini, as soon as he took over, forbade the people of our area -- we\u2019re in -- th-the interland of Fiume was Slav, Croatian and [indecipherable] Trieste Slav, Slovenian, he forbade them to use their language, he made them change their names, and he was stupid, while Franz Josef was smart enough to let each -- each nationality to use their own language and si -- that\u2019s why we lost that, kind of, because if he had been more intelligent, I will speak Croatian, which I love, and - and they wouldn\u2019t ha -- we -- we wouldn\u2019t have made enemies.

As far as I think -- v-vaguely this -- I -- we never investigated what they were doing or something, and -- you know. And we started to talk, wi -- you know, th-the balcony, which was giving on the tennis courts, it was the balcony of our kitchen, and by the balcony of their kitchen was just looking as -- an -- by us, to our balcony. So we -- I was already -- well, in \u201938, I was already 16 year old [indecipherable] something, and my sister was 12.

And they were at four -- ended \u201843. We became very close. When, in \u201943, the Germans took over our area, after the armistice, immediately after September eight, we, at that time were h-having our -- spending our vacation at the seashore in Lowranna, or Lovranna now, in Notelle. And we\u2019ve, unfortunately saw them arriving, the soldiers, how would you say? Making pee pee, you know, on the street, you know. Walking whi -- whi-while they were walking, going like this. Then we her -- we heard shots. They shot a couple of partisans who were already ready there, and they didn\u2019t let anybody to go near them. There was one in the orchard and we can -- nobody can go -- can go there to take care of this person, and so on. And so, since we didn\u2019t feel safe in the hotel, there was -- there were some Croatian friends who had a villa, which once belonged to one of the archdukes, because that area was very famous during the Austro-Hungarian empire. They were keeping their -- their mistresses and they were spending their vacation there, and Interview with Thea Rips \" January 20, 2004 this kind of thing.

And they -- they found a -- a f -- a fisherman, who took them by boat to Yugoslavia, to the -- to the Dalmatia actually, to the other coast.

Then they came back from Yugoslavia and they came to the apartment because they felt safe, an-and they were safe, nobody bothered them.

But they fact is that 1-1n -- in the -- between \u201938 to \u201943, Tondo became a big boy. They were -- in Fiume, everybody knew them because they were so visible, you know, tall, handsome, they see all [indecipherable] of them going, you know? So, they were -- th-they went to f -- they went to flo -- to the -- they wanted to go to Venice, but how do we go to Venice?

Okay, we -- Thea can take the -- the -- the documents for you, but -- but you le -- so they left with the f-forged documents on the train, and on the same train, like an idiot, I was on the same train as they were o-on with their real documents. So -- but we pretended not to know each other. I was sitting in one -- I -- I was sitting on one side, in one compartment, they were sitting on the other. And then, you know, we were in different are -- Tondo and I went on the corridor, we started to talk like two people who just meet, you know, it wa -- it was really Interview with Thea Rips \u00a9 January 20, 2004 something. They were no trouble. In the meantime we had told to my sist -- my aunt -- my mother\u2019s sister, who was living in Trieste, that they were coming, to please -- she s -- since she had the large apartment, not many beds, but a large apartment, an enormous living room, dining room, larger than this one, to arrange for them to spend the night there, because the next day they were going to -- to Venice. So when they arrived, we went to the house of my aunt, she had arranged some mats on the floor an-and we slept there. And the next day they went to Venice. Their new names were Sardi. They were no more Schtitzel, they were Sardi, and they went to live for awhile in hotel. But, of course, Venice and Fiume are pretty close and they were afraid that some people from Fiume would recognize them there, or [indecipherable]. And I remember that even I went once to visit with them -- o-or es -- yes, before leaving they gave us their jewelry, and there was another family too, in Abbazia, where they left a trunk, where she left her fur coats. I don\u2019t know what was there because we never saw the trunk and we never saw that family. And I don\u2019t know if -- how the stuff she gave them left. We -- they left in the apartment only some wine, some food that he had put aside, Mr. Schtitzel. But they gave us the jewelry, and she took only a beautiful diamond ring she had, she took with her. And they went to -- as I say, they went to Venice. I went to visit with them and by mistake I knocked at the door and I said, Mr. Schtitzel. The poor man was scared -- was scared to death, but I did -- you know, it win -- I-I -- without thinking. He was so scared. Anyhow, from there they moved to Milan where this engineer, Fierst, who was th -- Interview with Thea Rips January 20, 2004 working my -- with my father had found refuge in a -- in an apartment building in Milan, where many Jews were living we -- under ma -- different names, and they moved in there. The portieri knew about them, everybody knew who they were, but nothing happened. But the fact 1s that -- came that time that Tondo had the age to be called into the army. And th -- Mr. Schtitzel, Arnold, got so scared that he -- I don\u2019t know through whom, thi-this we heard later wa -- from -- from the sh -- from the Fierst who told them, don\u2019t do that, don\u2019t do that, they might not call him. Hide the boy, don\u2019t do it. Instead, no, no, no, no, we go to Switzerland, we go to Switzerland, we go to Switzerland. And the guys who were supposed to take them across the border apparently betrayed them, and -- and that was it. For a long time we didn\u2019t hear anything. The war was over. Tito occupied our area. And one day a nice gentleman knocks at our door. And he says, I am so and so and so. I am the head of the Jewish community here in Fiume. I know that you helped the -- the Schtitzels and that the Schtitzels gave you some jewelry, so on. Oh, says, thank goodness. So we gave to him -- he -- of course he -- he demonstrated [indecipherable] and we gave the jewels to him a-and then we didn\u2019t hear from him any more, but I\u2019m -- it -- I\u2019m sure -- how -- how else could he know if -- if they had not told him? We trusted him immediately and we gave him back the jewels. She had -- she had hidden her diamond in her rectum when she was traveling and of course they found it, you know, because there -- they were examining a-absolutely everything. And so -- and Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Thea Rips \" January 20, 2004 this man told us that Tondo and her -- and the father died in Auschwitz and, which 1s even more terrible, Nellie, the mother, was sick and she was killed by the dogs."

            "answer": "They were chasing after her and they -- and she died like this. In the meantime, they had left with us the address of her brother, who was living in New York, Otto Weiss. And I started to correspond -- as soon as I heard this, I wrote to him also, telling him about the jewels and telling him about the few things that they left with us, a -- a -- a silver box, because Mr. Schtitzel, during the first World Wars, was a officer in the Austrian army. And the box he left with us was a box that he received from his companions, I don\u2019t know in what occasion, with all the signatures of his companions. And we have a photograph of the group of Austrian officers, and he is there, you see? It was -- it -- and so I wrote to Uncle Otto in English, with my poor English, but I managed. No, I -- Ia -- at the time I was speaking some German, I don\u2019t know whether it was German or English, I mixed up things. I still have the correspondence, it\u2019s home.

And -- and that was it. And that was the end o-o-of the Schtitzel. And to us it was just like losing family, and- and to hear that they went like that was really terrible. I kept corresponding with Uncle Otto, who was sending us care packages, because under Tito it was much worse than during the war. That was the worst part of -- for us, because Fiume was bombed only by Interview with Thea Rips \u201c January 20, 2004- by the -- but when the British were bombing, where they were coming only with the s - small planes, with the Sp-Spitfires, you know, and they were -- since all the -- th-the -- the big industries were along the coast, they were not touching the city. They were going ba -- th -- shooting at whatever the equipment they had there. But th-then the -- the Americans came and then they bombed also the city, so much so that where we were -- no, we had shelters since there is the mountain behind th -- we are on the ocean and -- th- the sea and the mountain and the shelters were under the mountain. And when the Germans were there, in the -- in the -- a-and they occupied the shipyard, part of the he -- lighter works were hidden under the rocks under the mountains and so that -- and also, near our home there was a shelter under th-the hills, so that we were safe in there. And during that time, they were recruiting the Germ -- the Germans -- this 1s -- this has nothing to -- the Schtitzel were already away, but at that time, yes, we were still -- there were still Jews, men -- several Jews in Fiume. Among them were the two Farcas brother, Rudy and -- Rudy and Paolo. Rudy was the youngest one, a little bit light-headed, simple, very, very pleasant boy. And Paolo, who was helping my sister with her Latin, you know. And the ta -- the time came that -- when th-the -- the Germans started to recruit the young people to work -- the famous [indecipherable] organization, you know, to build a -- fortresses to -- to -- to build for them things all along the border because we were right on the border with the Yugoslavs, you know? And we were saying, Paolo and Rudy, Paolo, go away, go away, go away. Why do you stay here, why do you stay here? Interview with Thea Rips oS January 20, 2004 And they said no, but there is no, we are working there, they are kind to us, they are nice. We are not only Jews there, they were recruiting everybody, you know. And he said, no, no, he said, we stay. Then one day they took away their parents, and they said co -- and they took them to Trieste, to the only concentration camp that th-the Germans made in Trieste, the famous rice factory, you know, the risia -- Risiera where they -- well, they di- | don\u2019t know wha-what they did to them, they burned them or the wa -- I had -- I had no idea what -- what was going on. The Risiera now is the national monument in tr -- in Trieste, you know. A me-me -- a memorial. And we were telling them, go away, go away. No, no, no. When, after the parents were sent we\u2019d say, but now you better go. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. In the meantime also, my sister and myself were recruited and my sister became a welder. Be si -- since Father was working at the shipyard, he immediately put them to work there. I was studying to be a doctor, so I was in the infirmary, and I was there helping the doctor, giving injections for -- for all kind of people, you know? And my sister was a welder for the ships, you know? And -- and the funny thing 1s that they were repairing the -- one of the -- I think 1t was a cruiser, I don\u2019t rem -- I don\u2019t know the name, the American names of the ships, but anyhow, which had been damaged, and the work was not -- never proceeding because the workers were working and undoing. Doing and undoing so that the Germans couldn\u2019t get it, you know? But finally they had to do it, and they -- because the Germans started to -- so, it was completed, and they went [indecipherable] to test, they were only -- but they were only the workers, Italian, that Interview with Thea Rips January 20, 2004 they f -- workers. My father was on board, everybody. They went to sea, they tested, they came back, everything was perfect. The first time that the Germans went at sea with the [indecipherable] with the cruiser or whatever name it 1s, all at once we were standing on- in -- looking at the -- at that ship, because working there both of us, we were there at the shipyard with Father. All at once from -- 1t was a sky like this one with broken clouds and sun, out of the clouds, Spitsfires started to comes. They knew that there were only Germans on board, so there must have been, you know, something. And vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, they came back to the shipyard, you know, with wounded people and so and so. That was it. Then they bombed of course the -- the -- the -- the shipyard, the Americans who were in there. We were able to go underground, in -- under the -- th-the rocks. Then, when the bombardment was over, they brought some soldiers which were -- had been there [indecipherable] the German soldiers, I remember I had to give morphium to whoever there was very heavily wounded, the -- he broke a -- he lost a leg, but I remember he was there. We were -- we were two -- there were the -- the -- the -- the real nurse, then -- it was a man, the doctor and myself, and we had really to work, you know, [indecipherable] morphium Schwester, morphium Schwester, because he was in terrible pain. His hand was completely open, like this, you know. I gave him morphium and then they took him to the hospital. I heard that day he lost a leg, this soldier. And so the Farcas brothers were still there and one morning, it was a Sunday, we wake up and we could see the synagogue from our building, because it was very opened, Interview with Thea Rips _ January 20, 2004 and we see f-fire. We said, God gracious, that\u2019s the synagogue. So my sister and I got dressed. Father and Mother didn\u2019t even dream to say no, don\u2019t go. It was naturally for us, we all -- we went to there and the fra -- th-the -- the synagogue was as fa -- afire. And there he -- who was, Paolo and Rudy Farcas, who said, go away, go away. He says to [indecipherable] if the Germans see that you are with us, he said, you are in danger, go away. We said my -- no, don\u2019t -- when -- we didn\u2019t go away. We were there crying, crying, crying. You should have seen that synagogue, it was so beautiful. And -- but we se -- an-and they didn\u2019t let the firemen to go and take care of the fire. It was a terrible day. It was in \u201943 when they burned th-the synagogue, those [indecipherable] th-th-the -- the [indecipherable]. And that was it. And of course, after awhile Rudy and Farcas [indecipherable] Rudy an-and -- and -- and -- and Paolo didn\u2019t appear any more. They were taken and we don\u2019t know how -- what, we don\u2019t know. We can imagine how they end up. So that [indecipherable]. I think that\u2019s as far as our experience with [indecipherable].
