This is tape number one, side A. Mr. Gans, would you please start by telling me your full name, and where and when you were born?",
            "answer": "Okay, my name is Manfred Gans. I was bor n in a little town in West Germany near the Dutch frontier, the name of that town is Borken, it \u2122s -- at the time it used to be called Borken in Westfarn -- in Westphalia. A nd I was born in there on the 27th of April, 1922. My father\u2122s family had lived in that town at least since 1610. The town records showed that his -- the fa -- his -- his mother\u2122s family, by the name of Windmiller, were allowed to live inside the walled city of that town in 1610, which was very exceptional, because Jews generally were not allowed within walled ci -- cities."

But basically Jews had lived in that area, or in that town since sometime -- something like 1246. The exact history of the Jewish community has been reworked now, and is fully available in the -- in a group that has been formed in -- since 1988 in that town, who -- a small group of people who have occupied themselv es with the history of the Jews. And they have fabulous documents about everything. So if you have to clear up something, this is where you can go, and anybody who wants to research the subject should go to these -- to these people."

The town was a -- you know, was the county seat, and the -- all these other Je w -- little Jewish communities in the villages, some of them had their own synagogues, but none of them had school s. And -- so everybody had to come to -- to p -- all the Jewish children had to come to Borken for the Jewish schools. We -- oh, I had one towa -- want to mention one more thing which I -- this thir d thing is very important. So the Jews in a -- i-in effect, had lived in this town for 750 years. And though it was a free town, that means it was -- it was -- it had -- it was an independent town, which could make its ow n decisions, my father was the only Jew who was ever elected into the town council. There have been no Jews before that, and no Jews, of course, since that -- since itch -- there are no Jews living in the town now. Everybody emigrated, or perished in the Holocaust."

            "answer": "Okay. My father\u2122s name was Maurice Gans. He was born in 1885, and he went to -- like a -- all the Jewish kids in na -- in -- in the town, he went into the Jewi sh school for the first four years of his schooling, which we can suppo -- suppose we can calculate when that was. And then, at the age of 10, he went into the high school, which actually was a larger, Ca tholic school. And he graduated from there at the age of, I think about 16. He did -- he did not finish up as a full matriculation because there -- there was certain st ages. And from there on s -- from then he -- he went into the textile trade, a nd he was an apprentice in a wholesale textile ware -- company in Frankfurt, i-i-in -- in Germany. He -- when World War One broke out, he was a -- drafted into the German army. He was in Italy, and his unit wa s continuously short of food, and supplies, and he made it his business to go into the Italian towns and get provisions there. And coming back 3 from one of those expeditions, a -- a -- he was shot at by his own people, who hadn\u2122t recognized him, and as a result he lost a leg, and as a resu lt of a big loss of blood, he lost a lung, and so he -- his whole like -- life from there on, he had only one leg, and one lung. He was extremely brave. He was lucky that he was sent to a Jewish home for recuperation in Switzerland because of having lost the lung. Of course the -- you know what -- the --the -- the -- he was treated as if he had tuberculosis, which he did not have, and there he got involved in founding a Jewish recuperation home. I think it was called Itania, which was Orthodox and had kosher food and all those -- those things. When he eventually retu rned to his hometown, he set up his own company, and my mother was his partner. Now, ma -- tell you a little bit about my mother, because she had a totally different background."

Then, of course when -- when the -- when the -- there were so many elect ions just before the Hitler period, and he of -- he was the chairman of the social democ -- democratic party in town.

            "answer": "A colleague -- colleague should stay, rather than he. And so that he was out of it. Now, how did he get into this position that people voted for him? Wh en he returned to the town, after World War One, and set up his own business, he also took a very active part in the league of war orphans, widows. And -- I\u2122m trying to find a -- fi nd a English wor -- when people who had been injured in the war, there was a -- a -- a league lik e that, and he beca -- soon became the head of 4 that league. He had his staff work on all the applications whic h were necessary so that these war orphans, war widows, and people who had -- war injured could apply to the various government offices for the support to which they were entitled. And he never charged anybody for all these services, and therefore he became very, very popul ar. His staff was -- his office staff, which was concerned, of course with wholesale textiles, was a-accustomed to service the members of the league of war orphans, widows, and people who had b een injured in the war. Oh, I also started to tell about my mother\u2122s family, right? My mother\u2122s family lived in a little town called Falksen, which was near Hannover. And my grandfather, Ma urice Frankel, had come from somewhere in the Brunswick area, Braunschweig at the time. He had set up his own business, and this is a town, he was a total free thinker, didn\u2122t believe in organized religion at all. But -- and his wife, my grandmother had the same attitude, but it doesn \u2122t mean that they were hiding the fact that they were Jews, they were not at all hiding, but they just didn\u2122t believe in organized religion. Their ideal were opera, and theater, German [indecipherable] you know, that sort of thing. In fact, one of the sisters of my grandfather was an actress in Hannover, and she was a paramour of the king of Hannover. She was very good looking. Even I remember her, though vaguely. And of course, I\u2122ve seen pictures of her. So, it was totally different type of upbringing, but nevertheless my mother also had to go to Hebrew school tw o or three times a week, in -- this was a town called Springer, which was a -- probably only about four or five miles away. There -- you know, in those days of course there were plenty of trains. They went to and fro by train all the time. So she too had a smattering of Jewish education. A nd then when she finished elementary school, her parents sent her to a finishing school, to Belgium, a Jewish finishing school where essentially ladies learned to be good housewife, and as a result my mother was an outstanding cook, very much oriented towards the French cuisine, which she had learned in -- in Belgium. For a short 5 while, she actually worked, after the [indeciphe rable] she -- she was a -- a companion lady or whatever you call this, in the house of Rosensweig, was a German philosopher, Jewish philosopher who -- who -- usually his name is connected with Buber, who was in -- who was -- who was later on a professor in -- in Israel, at the [indecipherable] university. Of course, Franz Rosensweig was at that time already very sick. He had contact -- contract-tacted syphilis while he was in the German army in -- in Poland. And sa -- but he was an outstanding thinker, and vevery famous in his interpretation of general philosophy and Judaism."

That hous e is not in existence any more now, but I know exactly where it was, it was near the railway stati on in Borken. And my parents just rented an apartment th-there. Now, my father was very successful in business, he was a -- always a financial genius. And -- and I think in the year 19 -- yeah, \u212235, just before my younger brother was born, he bought a very stately house, just outside the town of Bork en, which had been built by a man who was the owner of a brick factory once, th-therefore they had -- they hadn\u2122t -- not spared any -- any expenses, any bricks, or anything like that. That house is still in existence now, and it\u2122s still an outstanding house, up to the -- up to the sis -- da -- this day. And it still has a lot of the features 6 which it had when we lived in it. At the time when my parents bought it, and it was not developed around it, gradually they, you know, they planted trees and bushes, and things like that. So we had two maids as servants, we had people looking after the vegetable gardens, and after the flower gardens. And above all, my father had a chauffeur, since he couldn\u2122t drive himself. He was always on the road for -- during th e whole week. Usually he came back at night, sometimes he did not come back at night, but he usually came back at ni ght and then went out again in the morning, into the rural district, to sell the specialty textiles to people who make custom clothing. So it -- it -- it -- i -- it wa-was certainly upper class. I think we had a higher standard of living than anything I have achieved since then, or my brothers have achieved since then. My older brother was called Karl, and he -- he was two years older than I. He\u2122s still alive now, he lives in Israel. Now he\u2122s called Gashom Kadar. He\u2122s changed his name during wor -- World War Two, when he was serving in a mixed Arab Jewish unit in the British army. And my younger brother, his name was Tayol, and when he went -- went -- went to Israel in 1950 -- let me see, he went to Israel in 1952. He too changed his name from Gans to Kadar. I have to excuse myself. "

            "question": "Okay, if you could just continue to tell me about your life in your childhood home, and was it a very festive life with your family? Tell me a little b it about the sort of routines that you had, you know, as a family, and at home.",
            "answer": "Well the routine obviously was we go to school every day. Until the age of 10, we went to the Jewish school, Jewish elementary school, where we learned both the secular subjects and the basic parts of the Jewish service, including the translation of the five books of Moses and things like that. So w-we had a systematic education in learning classical Hebrew . Then, at the age of 10, since our parents were well enough to do to -- they could send us to high school, we shifted 7 over to the high school. Now, th -- the routine at home was that we\u2122d all be in school until about one o\u2122clock and then came home and had the -- the main meal of the day. In the afternoon we were supposed to do our homework. Had some sort of other activitie s, we were essentially free. And the -- the -- yeah, the up -- of c-course it\u2122s -- is a -- home was essentially Orthodox. Not -- we wouldn\u2122t call this strictly Orthodox, call it like the modern Or thodox in the United States now here. And Friday evenings we would go to the service. After the service there would be a very festive meal. My -- my father would be hom e most of the time on s -- on Friday -- on the weekends. Saturday morning we would go to synagogue again. The synagogue would finish at about half past 10, 11 o\u2122clock. We then would go home and have a very festive breakfast, and after that we were obligated to go and visit our grandmother, my father\u2122s mother, who was living in town. And at that time she was beginning to be about 75 - 80 years old. And we had to visit her every Saturday. And after that we\u2122d go back to synagogue for the afternoon service, a -- which was at about one o\u2122clock, and about two o\u2122clock was the main meal, and in the evening at the end of the -- of the holiday, or Saturday, we would again go to synagogue and participated what\u2122s called the Havdalah service. So, it was a -- a life that revol-revolv ed largely around the Jewish religion. On Sunday we had to go to Sunday school, which was strictly devoted to Hebrew and Jewish history. The Jewish elementary school was a one room school with eight grades in it. Of course, we who -- whose parents were well off and could afford to send us to the high school only stayed in it for four years. But there were people -- Jewish kids in the school who -- whose parents could not afford to send them to high school, and who did all the eight grades in the -- in the one room school, this was a one room school. Which was very interesting because it -- it almost was like self education. Th ere was only one teacher, and h-he would attend to all -- to everybody, set tasks for everybody. But when he taught history, or when he taught 8 something to somebody else, of course you could al ways listen in. And I think [indecipherable] that was very, very good for our development. That\u2122s in my -- in my days, the name of that first teacher we had, his name was Gunsberg, and he became an outstanding person in the [indecipherable] s-service, or [indecipherable] organization in Israel, when he finally ememigrated to Israel, some time before World War Two."

Not hundred percent te -- hundred percent freely, but fairly freely with everybody. And there was not much of a distinction made between Je ws and -- and non-Jews, and you could communicate very easily with everybody else. In my case, of course, this only lasted for one year. And then in 1933, when I was 11 years old, Hitler came to power. But in the case of my older brother, this state of affairs had much -- lasted much longer. My cousin -- my oldest cousin, who was of -- the oldest amongst all of us who was at that time, he must have been already about 16 or 17, he had gone through that whole school, and of course had been totally integrated into the class in which he was. So th-tha -- there wa -- there was not much -- there was not much distinction made, but there -- there -- there was -- al ways was a certain amount of anti-Semitism.

More and more people were voting for Hitler, or voting for the right wing parties, some of whic h were eventually merged into the Nazi party. Another thing, another point I have to point out why all this was not so unexpected. When we visited my grandparents in Falksen near Hannover, they lived in -- in a town that was largely Protestant. And that town was very radically in with the Nazi before Hitler. So already in -- before Hitler, before 1933, when we went visiting there, there were a lot of kids who didn\u2122t play with us because we were Jews. A nd they were already converted. So it\u2122s a -- a -- th-they -- this is where the indic -- these were the indications of things changing. This a -- well, I never forget the day Hitler came to power. We we re having lunch, and we were listening to the radio, which was on because we listened to the one o\u2122clock news. And the newscast came out, and then suddenly the announcer said, \ufb01And here is a little message , which has just fallen on my desk, the president of Germany, Hindenburg, has appointed Adolf Hitler as the chancellor of -- as the next chancellor of the German state.\ufb02 A nd I remember my mother was very, very shocked to hear this, and somehow we took it and said -- said well, that wa -- this was just one of the things we had to face. The full implication of it, well I suppose we didn\u2122t ful -- fully realize -- at 12 the time the kids didn\u2122t, but my mother obvi ously did. My father was not home. I can\u2122t remember whether he came home that night. Bu t soon -- he certainly came home very soon after. Now -- things changed in school now very -- I would say very rapidly. There -- some of the cra - o -- some of our classmates were keen to jo in the Hitler youth. There wa s no Hitler youth in our town, and every time they had a demonstrati on, they had to call out the high school, which included us, for all their -- their demonstration, an d whatever they were celebrating at the time. Eventually my father got us out of there, we didn\u2122t have to attend those blasted ca -- wh-what -- what do they call it? It\u2122s called in German [indecipherable]. Had the torchlight parades and all that sort of things. We didn\u2122t have to go -- go al ong with that any more, but in the beginning we did, because the school just said everybody come t onight, there\u2122ll be a torchlight parade to celebrate this, that, and the other.

            "answer": "Oh yeah, definitely, we had absolutely no identity cris -- crisis. That, I think is the advantage of having grown up as a -- as an Orthodox Jew. My father\u2122s father had come from Holland to marry my -- marry my grandmother. And he ha d grown up with the Sephardic Jews in Holland, though he was not Sephardic himself. In fact they were from the part of Holland that borders on Germany. And -- but he -- he was -- he was very much aware of the Sephardic experience. And every time the word Spain was used, he spit. I didn\u2122t know him personally any more. He -- he died in 1917. He had a hernia [indecipherable] there was misop -- mis-operation, unfortunately. And -- but h -- so we were very, very much aware of the fact that expulsion, flight, and all that sort of things was part of the Jewish tradi tion. And there were two Jewish families living in town, who had come from either Poland or Russi a, and who had been exposed to this whole 13 business of pogroms, and -- and ma -- Jewish pe rsecution in the east. So again, everybody was Orthodox, so just was part again -- was accepted as being part and parcel of one\u2122s history. We had absolutely no identity crisis when all this came. People find that hard to believe, particularly I -- of course, later on in life, I came across a lo t of Jews, who f -- German Jews, who were not brought up Orthodox, who had all sorts of clashes, including the -- the people who -- when someone was in the army, and people [indeciphera ble] working professionally, and who had -- who -- who were -- whose -- had terrific identity crisis of -- of -- wh-when hi -- Hitler came to power, and when they were excluded from the soci al life which they had practiced up to that time. But as I said -- of course, the other point wa s we couldn\u2122t socialize that well with other pe -- with non-Jews, even before Hitler, because we were kosher, and we couldn\u2122t eat in their homes. And so it was -- it would be very rare if any of them would come to our homes, and eat with us. As one of my schoolmates told me back in -- in the 1988 -- 1992, when I went back to -- to the ha -- we first went back to our hometown, this -- we -- homes were not that comfortable in those days, and we all were friends because we played on the street. So the -- the intimacy that one now can experience in being in each other\u2122s home, we had -- we did not have that in any case."

            "answer": "Yeah. The -- of course the town was largely Catholic, and most of our classmates before Hitler belon -- belonged to a Catholic youth move ment. That was the standard thing to do, for everybody to belong to the Catholic youth movement. That of c ourse we -- we were already automatically excluded. We did not, at that time , have a Jewish youth movement to which we belonged, but we did later on. Now, all these -- of course, now the pressure became very strong 14 on all these members of the Cat holic youth movement to change over to the Hitler youth, and most of them did, eventually. It took a little while for everybody to go along that line, but this is -- this is where they went, eventually. And our attitude to them was you are wrong and we are right. Well, it\u2122s a -- things came to a head on th e first of April, 1933. Now, this was only what, three months after Hitler came to power? He come to power on the 13 th of January, 1933. The -- they started this boycott movement against Jewi sh businesses. And it was a Saturday, and there were storm troopers in front of every Jewish business to make su re that people wouldn\u2122t buy at -- in Jewish shops. And w-we of course had to go to school on Saturday, we didn\u2122t write, we didn\u2122t ca-carry our satchel because we were Orthodox, but we had to go to school and listen to the school classes. And while we were in school, the -- one of the teachers -- of the most trusted teachers, [indecipherable] was truste d most, came and called us out, and he said -- he said to us, I remember there were four Jewish boys in my grade, \ufb01Look, you know what\u2122s happening to you. I think it\u2122d be safer for you to go home now.\ufb02 S o, when we went home, and well, you know, this -- this was the dramatic, the most dramatic change you can imagine. Course our parents were -- I won\u2122t say shocked, but they were stunned. And my father wasn\u2122t going to take it. So he immediately [indecipherable] the Shabbat was out, he got on the telephone to the headmaster of the school, and he says, \ufb01Hey, what\u2122s happening? I\u2122m not going to send my children back to the school if you can\u2122t guarantee their safety.\ufb02 I am convinced th at that headmaster then had to contact all the necessary party lin es. I don\u2122t think there was a Gesta po in this town yet, at that time. I was very much aware of the Gestapo when it finally came, because of course, they -- they -- later on, at the outbreak of World War Two, they took over our house as Gestapo headquarters. But I\u2122m sure he -- he couldn\u2122t give my father a dir ect answer, he had to square this away with all 15 the authorities. Anyhow, by Monday morning he told my father that all the Jewish students could come back to the high school, and they could guarantee their -- our safety."

Anyhow, now m-my older brother, who d ecided that we should not communicate with our classmates any more. We -- we shouldn\u2122t wait. He was -- my older brother was the sort of leader of the Jewish kids. My cousin, who as I said, who was about at that time was 16 - 17 years old. When he died last year he -- in New York. He was -- he -- he wasn\u2122t in school any more, anyhow, so my older brother became the leader of the Jewish child ren, and he decided that we\u2122re not going to wait until we\u2122re excluded, we\u2122re going to separate ourselves. So from that time on was -- we did not communicate with our schoolmates any more in -- in the -- in the a -- in the periods between lessons. Well -- we -- communication was absolutely at a -- at a minimu m. You know, without any degree of intimacy between them and us. So, and this how I went to school for five years.

And so he was out, and so other Jewish children were taken out of school and sent abroad, or didn\u2122t continue high school. Emigrated and gone [i ndecipherable].

            "answer": "Interesting question. Was a -- what were we -- what were we talking about? Well, I don\u2122t think the subjects changed that dr-drastically. My parents were still very much interested in literature, talking about s-sub -- subjects of culture. And they -- they did occasionally discuss what we should and should not do, and what we should and should not say in public. And -- and if you had to be cautious and all that. At a very early stage of 1933, of course they came and -- the police and the storm troopers came into our hous e, and they went through my father\u2122s library, but they weren\u2122t -- weren\u2122t enough educated to even find the books that -- that were of dubious background. So my mother, too, ha d no -- absolutely no fear of these people. So I call them a bunch of drunkards who -- who belong to a club of dr-dr-drunkards, meaning the storm troopers. And I\u2122m sure they -- my parents are not afraid of them and nothing clos e to -- very radically happened. But my father was in the -- interesti ng point, my father was in the town council. He had advocated that the high school for girls, which only had 50 students in it, should be combined with the high school of boys. Now, of c ourse, in a Catholic town that was out of the question. My father had always based this on the huge expense the 50 student school was for the town to support, and they said there should -- there should be a combination of that. Well would you believe that within two months after the Nazis came to power, they combined the two schools? My father was away, I think in Hannover at the time, and my mother -- I remember my mother telling him on the telephone that this has happened, but of course she didn\u2122t say it direct because the telephones were probably listened to. But she said -- she used some Jewish 19 expression to -- to make him aware of that th is was -- was happening. Finally his scheme was being translated into reality.

You know, these sort of sports events that are organized, what shall we say, by kids themselves. There was a certain amount of exclusion there, and that it got worse. But there were -- there were classes to teach aircraft design in the afternoon, which I participated in and I\u2122m sure we were allowed to participate in. So it\u2122s -- i-it didn\u2122t change too drastically, except now, the other thing was of course that now we had a different teacher, who was very, very keen to -- to st -- to teach much about -- we had a different teacher -- teacher of the Jewish elementary schoo l, and he was very, very keen that we should go into much -- to greater depths in -- in Hebrew. And eventually we went to Hebrew classes. Now, I\u2122m talking about modern Hebrew speaking clas ses, every -- every day, except Friday. Every afternoon we had Hebrew classes. So that -- that was a radical change. And of course it did us a lot of good, and -- because go -- got us much into greater depths into Hebrew. This teacher, who also later on was -- became the headmaster of the Mizrachi high school in Tel Aviv, he started the -- also the [indecipherable] movement to which we then belonged, and so then it was sort of a little bit of a organization which was -- through which we met other Jewish kids from other towns occasionally, and so we were -- became th e members of the Mizrachi. Now it\u2122s a national religious party, but it wasn\u2122t as radical as that in those days. The youth movement, and we were part of that. 20"

So, there -- that was, of course, my idea, and I\u2122ve already mentioned, my older brother went to an eke -- went to Israel, went to Ben Shemen, which was the agricultural school in -- in Israel.

His wife was from a Jewish family that ha d settled originally in -- in Scotland, she spoke quite a good ger -- German, and sh-she was [indecipherable] woman, very hard working. They had one daughter, about my age, and also living with them was a nephew who was an orphan, and who went to business every day.

Well, of course, Hitler signs a piece of paper saying that this would be his last demand, and it will be peace in our time. That\u2122s the famous peace in our time.

This is all -- what\u2122s going to happen and so there was nothing we could do about it, and we just had to fit ourselves into this -- into this -- into this situ ation. Before the Munich agreement, a lot of people had left London, including my la ndlady and her daughters, [indecipherable] and I was sort of asked to look after myself, which I didn\u2122t mind at all. And they -- they re turned after the Munich agreement had been signed, and it was pretty su re that a war would not break out immediately. People we -- were divided. They ca -- people who were conservatives, conservative Jews, I mean, you know, this conservative party of E ngland. There were a lot of those in a rich community like Goldaskreen, and they took the attitude Chamberlain did the right thing. We have not got the means to go to war at the mo ment. He s -- fo-fought for time. The people who were liberal like Mr. Jacobs said it was a dishonor which we shouldn\u2122t have gone in for.

They -- they couldn\u2122t get used to this idea [indecipherable]. And, as I said, I was very much influenced by the views of people like Mr. Jacobs, who were liberals, who -- who thought this was a --a dishonor. So we\u2122ve faced reality, as best as we could. And -- and of course the pressure on -- on the German Jews which -- other Jews became larger, until more and more refugees coming into England, and a lot of -- and the difficulty of getting jobs for people, and getting a way of finding money to live on became larger and larger, but the British Jewish community was a [indecipherable] and an extremely well 34 organized, largely by volunteers. They had money available, and they -- I think they, in my opinion they took care of this refugee program in an excellent -- in a wonderful way, in spite of the fact of course, obviously everybody finished up living at a standard of living which was far, far below the sort of standard of living they had experienced in -- in Germany."

And I registered as the [indecipherable] I -- I went into the German Jewish aid committee, and saw what went on ther e for a whole day. And in the evening, one of the ladies, she was from the Shief fam -- fam ily -- you know, these were all volunteers, people who did this. She had -- obviously has a tough day, and she says, \ufb01Would you like to go to Manchester?\ufb02 I said, yes, I\u2122ll go. I thought it was very important th at we -- we refugees would not all congregate in London, and so -- so I -- together with a few other people, a few days later, I went to Manchester, and again, there was a organized German Jewish aid committee, first liv -- 35 first lived in a -- in -- what do you call -- would you call it, I don\u2122t know. Some sort of communal house, which again it was, you know, had to be kosher, and -- and it was very nicely organized, and all that, and of course we had to work and keep it clean and all that. And the c-committee went out and to tr-try to find us jobs. And -- and through them, eventually, I got a -- a job which -- which I liked very much.

And it tu rned out to be an extremely good experience. It\u2122s an interesting story, you can tell it in great details. Again, I had to make it clear that I wouldn\u2122t work on Saturday, I wouldn\u2122t work on Friday afternoons, or would go home early on Friday afternoons. But they -- they didn\u2122t mind at all, they said, \ufb01Look, if you don\u2122t work, you don\u2122t get paid. If you clock in and you clock out, and that\u2122s it.\ufb02 Initia lly the German Jewish aid committee subsidized my -- my salary a little bit, and after I found -- I had started working in this job, they told me in the home where we were, that I should go to a ce rtain place, to a certai n address where I would be able to make arrangements to finding a place -- permanent place to live, a lodging to -- to live. I went to this place, I had hardly changed from my work clothes, and I went to the right address, and to my great surprise I was in -- at a beautifu l estate, very rich, obviously very rich people. I didn\u2122t know what it was all about, but I was hope [indecipherable] the right address. It turned out that my friend Mr. Jacobs had made arrangements for this very well-to-do family to go and be introduced to me. These were the Steinats. They were, you know, the Laskeys, the famous Laskeys were the richest family in Manchester, Jewish family in Manchester. And the Steinats were the second richest families. And they were - s-started my relationship with that -- that family. The brother of Mrs. Steina ts had also been an officer in the Jewish brigade in World War 36 One, and that -- so the connection between Mrs. Jacobs and the Steinats. So you see it\u2122s just all -- all a question of connection with -- and it was very important in England, everything is cconnection. It\u2122s not what you know, it\u2122s whom you know. And the Steinats made arrangements for me to be billeted, to -- to -- to rent a r oom from a lady who had been the second driver of Mr. Steinats father. Mr. Steinats hated her like the guts. He didn\u2122t like her at all. But it came in handy for me to -- to live there, and I lived there w ith another German Jewish man, who was two years older than I, and -- and there was a very old man also living ther e as a lodger. Now, this lady rented rooms, and she provided meals. It was pretty primitive, but all right, I -- I didn\u2122t [indecipherable] I d -- the -- the job which I ha d accepted, w-w-was technically very good, but it again, the circumstances of -- of clea nliness, and toilet facilities we re just d-disgusting. But I th -- I thought this is part of living like this, and I was living on the -- during the week I was living in the poverty of a working class atmosphere, and on weekends I was going to the Steinats for practically all my meals, and living in a very, very high class atmosphere. Undoubtedly the Steinats were richer even than my father was. And I -- I thought it was greater -- a great experience. So I -- I think I have to take another trip to the toilet."

            "answer": "Well, just let me tell you about one more item th at was also very significant in my life. It -- first of all, as you may remember or may know, I think it was in February, 1939, Hitler marched and took over the rest of Czechoslovakia. Of course, everybody thought the war was going to break out immediately then, but I -- I was sure it wouldn\u2122t. Because now the attitude of France and England changed, and they started sending their foreign ministers to Moscow to try and get a gr-great alliance with the Russians going. And of course that was their big hope, that they eventually would pull that off, and pull it off together. And -- and all the workers in -- in the 37 factory where I worked said we\u2122ll be in war -- at war in a week or so, and I say, no you won\u2122t be. They going to try this, and they\u2122re going to be -- do their best effort to -- to pull a -- make alli -- a major alliance with the Russians. And this is very much what happened. So nothing much happened politically, every -- except that everybody was sure that eventually there would be a war. But the -- these two elephants were not in -- on the way yet. Then on Shavuot, 1939, I was at the Steinats again, and so I mentions that I had just -- had bu -- gotten a chief rabbi from Manchester, Dr. Altman, who was, not to me, but to other people, a well known rabbi from Berlin. Quite young, he was in middle 30\u2122s, or -- at the time, and sa -- for the [indecipherable] after the synagogue ceremony, th -- the Steinats had invited Dr. Altman and his wife, together with a few other very prominent people of th e Jewish community. The day was glorious, the weather was glorious, the food was incredible. Of course it had to be non-meat, being Shavuot, and this is where I came to know Dr. Altman, who later on became the head of the -- head of the Institute of Advanced Jewish Studies at Brandeis University. And he -- we became friends right there and then, and he is being -- he being -- he was my mentor, from whom I learned an awful lot, until the time he died in, I don\u2122t know, some times in the 80\u2122s. He was professor at Harvard, same time professor at Jerusale m University. And but that\u2122s - basically he was a fantastic thinker, with tremendous ideas, and I attended a lot of lectures which he gave, mostly in Manchester, and then later on here, in this country.

So that was sometime on May, 1930 -- \u212239. And then, actually on -- so then, in beginning of September, 1939, it suddenly transpired that Germany had made a pact with the Soviet Union, or the Soviet Union had made a pact with Germany that they were going to divide up Poland between the two of them. I don\u2122t 38 know whether we were a hundred percent aware of it, that they were going to divide up Poland at that time, but you know, that\u2122s what it amounted -- amounted to. And now the road was clear for Hitler to march into Poland, and -- which he did on September first, 1939. England declared war on the following Sunday, this was -- September fi rst was a Friday, and England declared war on a -- on a Sunday night. And I happened to be at the St einats at that time, listen -- listened to the speech which Chamberlain made, over the radio, whic h he pointed out that I ca -- I -- I wish I had the -- the exact text of this.

            "answer": "That\u2122s this here. So the -- the first thing -- th e first thing we experienced at the time, was that we all had to register, we German Jews, and we were, in a typical British fashion, put before a tribunal, which [indecipherable] each case individua lly, and people were classified into a categ -- German -- you know, we were off -- t-to the British we were all German. There were -- category A went straight into interment camp, category B could go on living under certain circumstances, and category C were totally free, and being treated like British people. Of course with my connections to the Steinats and all that, I had no difficulty in being assigned to c-category C. So i-it didn\u2122t affect me in the beginning, at all. The -- there now was a -- a c-call-up. Conscription was enacted, people were called to the services, and obviously the country was getting on a war fut -- footing slowly. This was the period which we call the phony war because nothing happened. There was a British expeditionary force se nt into France but not into Belgium. And th they were very -- an-and the western front was extremely inactive, nothing happened there at all. 39 Hitler was occupied in the east, conquered Poland, and this was a -- and apparently things were very quiet, but everybody realized this was a quiet before -- before the storm. I continued to work in the same place I was, and in January ni -- 1940, I managed to pass the high school certificate, which I had continued preparing -- prepared in pravin -- largely in private class, private pa -- private tuition, and not -- not even going to any classes at all. I had a pr -- civil pri -- different private teachers. I -- I had a very heavy German bicycle, which -- with which I run around all over the place, at all times of the days and nights. And somehow this way I -- I managed to -- to -- to survive. In -- now, you know, jobs became freely available. There was a shortage of workers everywhere, and after awhile I decided I wanted to go and do something closer to what I -- my long term aim was, and I got myself a job in a factory that manufactured agricultural machinery. They -- actu al -- in actual fact, the actu -- the experience was -- I felt was not very good, and the agricultural machinery was very crude compared with what I had been doing up to that time, and I didn\u2122t think I was lear ning too much from getting -- being exposed to this machinery, and I have -- wuf -- had more or less made up my mind to give all this up, and go into a different direction, for to -- to go into mach ine tools, which were th -- at the height of -- of what has -- one has to know as a mechanical engi neer. But then of course, came the invasion of - first of Norway and Denmark, and after that th e invasion of the lowlands, and the attack on the western front, and now everything changed.

It was in Bury, B-u-ry, and there were about -- there must have some thing like two or 3,000 people in it. They ranged from German merchant sailors, so ver -- real Germans who had been taken prisoner on the high seas, to us, the ultra Orthodox Jew, or the Orthodox Jews.

That was a lot of time to spend, but a lot of people had bor -- brought good books, and tis -- there were interesting discussi ons.

From there we were eventually shipped to a place near Shrewsbury, which was an internment camp which was all tents, so we lived in tents.

And we kept to our -- ourselves, and everybody tr-tried to he -- help, and make -- make a go of it. [indecipherable] I -- I did feel -- I became quite weak because of the lack of food.

So it -- it was more -- it was definitely done more for morale and propaganda than for actually being afraid that things might -- sas -- there might be spies amongst ourselves, and so on, so forth. So I -- I was willing to accept this affect, that this w-was a necessary move that the governm ent had to make. And then in -- I think it was beginning of December 1940, it was my turn to -- to leave, and we -- I joined the Pioneer Corps, but actually what was happening was we were -- we were ju -- went by boat and train from the 44 Isle of Mann, first to Liverpool, and then to Ilfracombe, which is corn -- Cornwallis, or -- you know, it\u2122s just -- just south -- in the far southwest of England. That was the headquarters for the Pioneer Corps, the -- Pioneer co -- the alien man -- Pioneer Corps. The other members of the Pioneer Corps were British s- soldiers, who had -- actually were very -- had come i -- were not -- not completely trusted because of legal difficulties, or were people who had -- were not fit at all. So we had these German Austrian companies of the Pioneer Corps, that were made up of very f - relatively very fit German Austrian Jews. And -- and the Pioneer Corps stayed there in Ilfracombe in the southwest for a few weeks, for so me sort of basic traini ng, which of course did not involve weap -- weapons. We were not trusted with weapons. And from there we went to Yorkshire, my company went to Yorkshire, an d -- which there w-was a big army camp, Ketray camp, and from there we went to a very nice pl ace in the -- the lake district, beautiful place where we build a -- a petroleum dump for storin g gasoline. You know, it was all labor work. In Ketray camp, I don\u2122t think we did that much labor yet, but then we went to this Sedberg. Now Sedberg was in the lake district, a beautiful town with -- whic h had a -- one of these what\u2122s called public schools, which of course are these very, very private schools in England. And i-it was pleasant, very pleasant to be there, first time a chance to go out and go to dances, and go to m-mix with the population, started having a girlfriend, things of that nature. Also, the other thing was my father had a cousin in York. And I\u2122d neve r met them, but I knew they were there. And so one Sunday I hitchhiked to York, and I came to know my father\u2122s cousin, who was the owner of a very, very successful factory in -- i-in -- in England. I\u2122d heard about him, but I\u2122d never been there, I\u2122d never been in touch with these people, but I just happened to go there. And on -- on a Sunday afternoon, and I happened to find them at home. He had bought up a patent in Italy for a plastic which has what we would now call -- basically the structure of nylon. But he made it -- he 45 made it out of the milk that was rejected from the chocolate ma -- making process. And he sold this -- his idea to Roundtree in York, the famous chocolate company, and he ec -- he got -- got their waste product, and he made this plasti c which was called not Bakolite, but Gansolite, because his name was Gans, too. And they had this big factory there, very successful, and his home really -- which was also one of these beauti ful estates, almost in the center of York, his home was sort of the rallying point for all of us Gans and related families from the American and British army, who happened to be in England. A nd this was -- this was a very, very nice ccontact, and a very nice connection. I volunteered for every -- every damn thing that could be, to get me out of the Pioneer Corps. England wa s now alone. You know, the United States was not in -- not in the war, and Russia was -- had succes sfully divided Poland with hi -- with Hitler. So they were not in the war. So the i -- the British had the idea that the only way they could possibly inflict a lot of damage on Germany was to have a huge Air Force. So they were looking for volunteers for people to go into the Air Force. Well, I went to the examination, and all -- the examination was in Blackpool, which was -- was about two or three hours by train ride from where -- from where I was. Passed the examinati on, was accepted in, but of course they -- they didn\u2122t understand. When they f -- looked at my na tionality they refused to let me in. But I had the -- I ha -- for ye -- for a long time I carried around this piece of paper which showed that I had passed the part of the acceptance process for the Air Force.

I want to tell you a story which is very, very interesting, I\u2122ve -- I\u2122ve not told it before. When we were in the Isle of Mann in the inte -- internment camp -- as I said, we were Orthodox Jews living together, there was a man there by -- he was the son of Rabbi Spitzer from Hamburg. Rabbi Spitzer from Hamburg was known as a great Talmudist, very ultra-Orth odox who had come out of Hungary to become a -- a rabbi, chief rabbi of -- of Hamburg, in Germa ny. His son was regarded to be far superior to the father, as far as brain and knowledge was concerned. And one day t -- one day to the other, the son decided that a rabbinical career was not for him, and he wanted to go into law. He knew Talmudic law fantastically, and he then went a nd became -- took his legal papers in Germany. Of course he couldn\u2122t practice by the time he\u2122d finished. So, you know, he couldn\u2122t be a lawyer, Jewish lawyer in Germany any more. But he was with me in there, in the same house in which I was in -- on the Isle of Mann. And he -- he was a tall man, good looking man, always -- he did not run around with a yarmulke, he run -- was running around with [indecipherable] golf cap -- golf cap [indecipherable], but I mean, he was a ul tra, ultra-Orthodox Jew. Extremely well versed. I mean, a lot of the things which I have learne d, attitudes which I have taken on Halachak and Jewish law, I\u2122ve learned from him. Well, the da y when we -- we volunteered, when I and two or three other people in the house volunteered for the British army, it came out -- we went into our dining room where -- which was the only common room there was, and we announced to people 54 there that -- what we had done, that we volunteered for the army. There was a fellow there by the name of Josele. Well, Josele was a devoted Ye shiva student, absolute -- not too brilliant, absolutely devoted to -- to [indecipherable]. He got very, very upset, and he said, \ufb01If y -- you -- what you doing is you will have to work on Saturdays, you\u2122ll hardly be able to eat kosher food. You will have to starve yourself to go. This -- the fact that you volunteer for this army, it just goes to show that you put your secular existence far above your Jewish consciousness.\ufb02 And in the corner was this ra -- Spitzer, the lawyer ra bbi, and he was sitting behind his books. And he came out, he -- he looked up from his book, and he said, \ufb01But Josele,\ufb02 -- remember, this in 1940, \ufb01it\u2122s -- it\u2122s not a mitzvah -- mitzvah to fight Hitler?\ufb02 Josele, he had a totally different -- totally different attitude to this -- to -- he saw the larger implication, in spite of the fact that by that time there had no -- not been concentration camps, mass extermination a nd all that sort of thing.

            "question": "-- into actual war time fighting?",
            "answer": "Yes, it -- yes. We had -- we had been -- we had tried to do certain raids on France before D-Day, by parachute, and certain missions were plante d, or didn\u2122t come off, some of them, bec -- because we always -- when you were -- when a -- when a force like that went out by parachute, they had to go out with the massive bombers that attacked the American and British bombers that attacked [indecipherable] Germany at the time. So you had to blend in, and then you drop -- you drop out and do certain things. Well, none of thes e things came off, partially because of bad weather, partially because the information was obtained from different means and so on, so forth. So, though we had been prepared for certain raids, and some of us had been on certain raids, I personally had not been in any actual fight until D-Day. We were seque stered -- oh, let me go back a little bit. The -- our troop, the German speaking inter-allied commando troop was split up 56 just before D-Day, when there were four or five of us attached to every invading commando troop. I was assigned together with a fellow by the name of Morris La timer, whose -- and the Sergeant Major of the troop, O\u2122Neill, and a fe llow by the name of Tommy sw-Swenton. These are all these cover names of course. Morris Latimer, for instance, was Morris Levi from the Sudetenland before he joined that troop. So we were assigned to 41 [indecipherable] Marine commando. And we were held in camps for I think two or three weeks while we were being briefed about the landing. And w -- we coul dn\u2122t communicate with anybody outside because those -- they were -- didn\u2122t tell us where we would land. We knew -- we had -- we saw maps, for which people who really knew France well could have guessed where this was. But I\u2122m -- we personally, we didn\u2122t know where it was going to be. We didn\u2122t know we were going to land in Normandy. So we were in these camps for about tw o or three weeks, and then one evening, total darkness, we were -- we embarked into little boats, infantry landing boats, which had -- each boat had maybe something like 80 people. And the -- all flotilla set out without light, without any intercommunication, in a pitch dark night. And as far as I know there were no -- no accidents. We sailed past the Isle of Wight in total darkne ss, couldn\u2122t see anything at all. And -- and that was it. The sea was not too rough, it was acceptable, and we -- as we approached, as we came closer to the coast in the morning, well, it must have been about six or seven o\u2122clock in the morning by the time we landed. But before that we could start to see the massive bombardment of the coast, and the shooting back of -- of the -- of the German guns back to us. And one of us always sat on the steps, so that s -- way you could look out and sort of gave a running commentary on what was happening, what he was seeing, and soon -- of course pretty soon the German [indecipherable] guns started -- the shells started falling nearer to us. Lucky tha -- luckily we were not hit. And now, before all this, while we were in the camps, Montgomery, the 57 a -- the British commander had come around, and he had said, \ufb01Look, every time there\u2122s a landing, everybody sticks to the beach because they want to be protected by the Navy. Get off the beaches. You can -- don\u2122t,\ufb02 -- and that struck me as being very, very significant. The really tr-trust that the British have in their Navy, that I could see that the soldiers wouldn\u2122t get away from the beach. And I was absolutely set I was not going to let this happen to me. So, when -- when the -- the -- the -- our boat approached the - the coast -- and of course as I said, we now were under direct fire -- as soon as I could, I run down the gangway, and I got -- got down -- was on the beach, and lo and behold, I saw about 25 Ge rman soldiers who had been taken prisoner by the engineer\u2122s unit that has preceded us, who were supposed to blow up the obstacles, the anti-tank obstacles that were on the beach. And so I run over to those Germans, and I say to them, \ufb01Where\u2122s the pass through the mi nefields?\ufb02 Well, you know, at that time -- a few days later I didn\u2122t have any fear of mines any more, but at that time I still wa s very much aware. And lo and behold, when I didn\u2122t threaten them, and, you know , about being -- talking their own language, the first thing that occurred to me is these guys look exactly like us German Jews. Different uniform and they could be on our side. And lo a nd behold they told me. I didn\u2122t threaten them, I had the tommy gun down. I just said, in a very calm way, \ufb01Where\u2122s the pass through the mine fields?\ufb02 And they pointed it out to me. And so I gathered as many people as I could, and I\u2122d gotten through the -- gotten off the beach, and gotten into Lyon sur Mer without a single casualty. So the -- the -- the -- that -- that was, that part of it, that was off, and actually we lost 50 percent of the unit. Out of 450 people we lost 50 percent on that day. Later on, when we made the landing in Washoe, in -- which was much more heavily defended than the Normandy beaches, much more heavily defended, we lost, out of 450 people, we lost 11 people in the landing. But by that time we were so experien ced that nobody could come equal to us. And 58 everybody did the same as I did, get off the boat, get over the beaches, forget about it and get out."

            "question": "So this was the -- the end of D-Day for you?",
            "answer": "No, not at all. This was the beginning of D-Day. Now, they -- we n -- we knew where the German strong points were, and we were at th e other end of the village. Luckily, the pass through the mine field was at one end of Lyon sur Mer, and the German strong point was in the other. I had no doubt where we were. You know, we had studied the maps sufficiently. I knew we were at the other end, we had nothing to be afraid of, not until we would get to the strong point. Obviously the Germans are go -- going to be in their strong points. Why should they be out on the road, in the French villages? The Fr ench who have murdered them, you know? So, the first thing, I gather up a few guys, we started ma king our way along the road that was le -- going towards the German strong point. But, you know, you -- you cannot be out in the streets, I -- and -- when it -- when it comes to -- when there\u2122s so much artillery fire and mortar fire. It\u2122s -- the splinters will carry. So you have to go from one door to the other, dive in and dive out. And of course the population was on our side. They willingly opened the doors for us. So I says you know, you couldn\u2122t do this in Germany. We knew that we would never be able to do this type of street fighting in Germany, and we didn\u2122t intend to do it, and the British high command saw to it -- had come to the same conclusion. So we were diving from one house into the other. In some houses actually there were people who had been quite badly injured, with all the bombardment by one side or the other. In fact as -- as we got out, you know, to the road first, there were some British soldiers who had obviously been killed by being out on the street when the -- when a shell exploded. You know, y-you cannot stay out under these conditi ons. So we worked our way -- a few of us worked our way towards the strong point. When we got into this position where we 59 thought we were about in the view of the strong point, we knew there was an anti-tank gun pointing at us down the road, we got off the street, we got into [indecipherable] abandoned houses, which was quite obviously that we were now very close to the strong point. And I went upstairs and tried to look out and look into the strong point, but some German sniper must have seen me there, and he fired at me, but thank G od he missed. So I rushed downstairs again. I think I -- so I went down into the house, and we were sort of milling around, deciding what to do next, when we heard a loud bang on the house next door. And ta -- so -- obviously some missile was going from our side into the strong point. So we really didn\u2122t know what the hell this was. We were absolutely sure that apart from our -- ou r people there could be nobody there. So we went there, and we found an Arab, who had the typical look of what the -- how the Germans portrayed the Jews, you know, black hair, crooked nose and all that. And he had a 19 [indecipherable] war front loader rifle, which he somehow had gotten hold of, and he was firing this into the German strong point. So -- because nobody spoke French, ik -- yeah, my own French was very deficient in those days, I now speak French much better [indecipherable] transfer two years in the meantime. But we persuaded him that he should jo in us, which he gladly did. And he was with us for -- until the winter of 1944 -- \u212245. So, after that, the colonel of the unit wanted me to go with him and look at all the different positions which the different tr oops of 41 commandos had now taken up around the German strong point. And I went with him. And he was one of those guys who wouldn\u2122t take no notice of any German fire. He was r unning around with a briefcase. His name, I think, was Colonel Grey, but he spel led it with e-y, and not a-y like I did. And he -- he wouldn\u2122t throw himself down and her -- heard an artillery shell come over, and we heard a mortar come, and -- and [indecipherable] but I wasn\u2122t going to do this, so I dodged the way I\u2122d learned to dodge it, and as a matter of fact the next day the colonel was severely injured, he was 60 out of the war. So, so much for somebody taking such incredible risks, were totally unjustified. But then we had -- I -- a troop of South African armored vehicles came up and came into the village from the beach, and the colonel persuaded them to make a straight attack along the main road to -- on -- on to the German strong point . Which was crazy. The way we did this later on, we used armored vehicles, and even tanks, only as mobile guns. We had them -- h-hid them somewhere in the field, and had them shoot a nd lay down covering fire while we went in. Anyhow, this attack totally failed. I didn\u2122t participate in it because I knew it would -- would be practically suicide to do that. But there was one of the troops of 41 [indecipherable] commando, Y troop, and they lost about half the troop of what they still had, in trying to do this attack, because as we knew well from our -- from the maps we had been given before D-Day, there was a German [indecipherable] tank pointing right down the road. There was no chance that an armored car could get by that. So we hadn\u2122t -- we hadn\u2122t -- we had not succeeded in taking the strong point on that day. By now it was getting late. We were in a -- on a farm outside Lyon somewhere, and I also was getting extremely hungr y, and I -- I found myself of -- a ditch that had a sort of stone lining on both sides, which I t ook cover, and start -- started to prepare some of the food which we had, it was -- I hadn\u2122t eaten all day long. I don\u2122t think we had eaten during the night either. There was cocoa. There was -- I mean, there were drinks availa ble, but I -- I didn\u2122t take strong drinks because they slow down your reaction too much. And jus -- just at that time, the -- there was a magnificent sight of massive nu mbers of allied gliders, British gliders come -- being pulled by airplanes coming over, to land on the other side of Lyon canal, and they were sort of -- you know, you could see them being detached, going on their own, and coming down.

But, you know, it -- one fighter alone could not make much of a difference, probably sent in to scare people off, but it didn\u2122t -- couldn\u2122t -- it wouldn\u2122t work in our case. So this was the first -- this was D-Day, it was the end of D-Day. I slept very well that night in my ditch. I needed it. Next morning, we continued what we were supposed to do on D-Day, we were supposed to conquer German headquarters, move it inland.

So, next morning the first thing we -- it was decided we\u2122ll attack the German headquarters in -- inland. Well, that didn\u2122t tu-turn -- it wasn\u2122t much of a headquarters. This happens to be a battalion that had just come from the Russian front and they were pretty decimated. And we decided we were not going to go with covering fire, we were just going to run in and surprise them, and s -- which came off beautifully. And s -- I found three Ge rmans there who were obviously volgama -- the Germans call volgadeutshe, the German nationals from -- from Russia or Poland, they\u2122re -- very hard to understand them. I tried to get some more information from them, but they proved ttotally useless. So then I turned around to take part in the attack on the Luc sur Mer strong point -- the Lyon sur Mer strong point, but by the time I arrived there, the strong point had given up. And th -- so, I was late. They -- I don\u2122t exactly know how -- I think it was B troop of 41 62 commando that was under the leadership of -- of very, very good officer, whom I had accidentally met already a year ago before that.

Now, I must say that I know of others who j -- of -- from [indecipherable] commando, who had tried this and did not succeed in -- and -- and -- and who got killed in one of these attempts, and I almost was in a similar situation, too. We ll, the -- after we -- we -- after this D-Day experience, we had a rather unique experience besieging two underground German radar stations.

And -- which we -- which we successfully managed to do for about a week or so. There were a lot of adventures that we had, where we did things that were totally wrong, that you would never have done a month or two later when we had much more experience. But lu ckily most of the time we were -- we got away with it. Eventually enough equipment was saved for us -- spared for us that we could do a daylight attack on it, and -- and it was successful. Again, I managed to get these guys out, to surrender. So you had -- we took 450 people prisone r on -- on that day, and we marched them down to the beach, to the -- t-to -- to the prisoner camps of which ther e were there, but we shipped out. That was an interesting experience which I\u2122ve written up in great detail. If you want to read, you can read it. After that experience, we went to the -- what we might call the eastern front of the Normandy beach head, which was on -- we -- we were in the part that was hev -- very heavily fortified, which was still the extens ion of what the Germans call the Atlantic wall. And, of course this -- I call it the Hedgerow war, because the -- we were always going along or through some hedgerows to get to our -- to find the German alliance, so [indecipherable], a-and th-this was a -- a -- oh, of course you got a -- a tiring sort of a -- of a experience, but we managed to keep the Germans on their toes with lots of patrols, and usually I had to go out on every damn patrol there was, because by na -- by now the troops, the Marines would hardly ever go out 64 unless I -- I or -- mo -- Morris La -- or I was present, Morris Latimer had been injured on the radar stations and he had went back to -- to England. The Sergeant Majo r O\u2122Neill was still with me, swent -- Tommy Swentin had gone home on d eeplus two or three, he said he was shell-shocked. And O\u2122Neill was still there, but he was largely with the officers, so I hardly ever saw them -- saw him."

From th ere we shifted over to something absolutely terrible, the southeastern part, the southeastern corner of the beach head. Again, this was the -- the only thing that was lucky about it is there ha -had been a British guards battalion there before us, they had dug some way with trenches. We were now something like, maybe maximum 200 - 300 yards away from the German lines. And th e bombardment was day and night, mortars, artillery. Artillery is all right because you know it goes off and you can hear it coming and you 65 know what to do, throw yourself into a ditch. But the mortar fires were -- could be very surprising, you know. We -- we -- we le -- it was o -- it was a lot like being in World War One, it was trench warfare practically. But at night again, we went out on patrol, shot up patrols, we got shot up on -- on patrol and things like that until one day -- of course we were very much aware of the fact of what was happening on the other fronts. The fact that the Americans were breaking through and going south, that they were going west into Brittany, and that they were swinging around as the British -- had been a terrible mass l-losses of germ -- of two and a half German divisions in one night with that -- were poised for counterattack on -- on the British advance, th -- the Germans had not -- thought that they could keep this counterattack of two and a half German divisions secret, but they -- but of course it was all seen from the air, with the ability that the British Air Force had to -- to look at all Ge rman movements, and so it came in with a very heavy -- before the -- the Germans could even st art to move, came in with a very, very heavy thousand bombers attack. And most of these two and a half -- the people of the two and a half divisions -- SS divisions, they -- they died through lack of ox -- oxygen, or lack of -- or ho -- of hi -- excessively high pressure that they ex-experienced being out in the open, being ready for counterattack.

I -- even when I -- the first time I got back into my own hometown in Borken, which was Easter Saturd ay, the town had been taken on the Thursday, Thursday, that Thursday before Easter. I knew about it, and you know, by that time I -- I was an officer, I could move around as I wanted to. Ev erybody supported me, and I went into Borken, and we -- even at that time we realized that things were not over.

You know, this is hundred miles away, this is almost on the -- on the line with -- where the two armies, the Russian and the -- a-and the ar -- western forces met. Even there, there was still resistance. It -- it was just unbelievable. We knew this fa -- and they were fanatics, these people.

It\u2122s like telling you, look there\u2122s not a single house standing any more between -- between 72 nd Street, and -- and city hall in New York. Everything is destroyed. That gave him a concept of -- of how incredible the destruction had been. When I drove through Muenster, which I ha d known, through this massive rubble, where -- but you know of course the roads had been cleared by American bulldozers, because after all, our armies had to get through, all I met was one wo man who was crazy, was on -- on -- on a ha -- on a -- on a -- in black -- in a black dress, with all around was -- that was Germany. That was the revenge. I don\u2122t remember what th e -- the divisions, the two and a half S.S. divisions that had been blasted out of the s -- from the sky, and that -- that -- that died for lacks of -- lack of oxygen. And they were supposed to be counter-attack. That was revenge. Nuremberg trials, none of them -- none of us thought of them. The re venge had been. It was -- it was the end."

            "answer": "Yeah, yeah, it\u2122s hard for -- it\u2122s hard for non-technical people to realize that, but the fact of the matter is that I\u2122ve had a few -- if -- if -- as I\u2122v e done, if you put a large chemical plant on line, with a new process, new, untried equipment, and all that sort of thing, the -- the experience is more telling than almost anything I\u2122d done in the war. As I said in one of the comparison, on the night of the fifth or sixth of June 1944, we landed in fra -- landed in Normandy, 1944, in the night of the fifth and sixth of June 1957, I put a high pressure, or elevated pressure chlorination plant on line in -- in southern France, and I sweated more blood in 1957 than I did in 1944. But it\u2122s very hard for non-technical people to realize what is involved in the invention, development, design and start-up -- a commercialization start-up of a chemical process. That -- that\u2122s one -- on aspect of it. So there have been very -- a lot of very interesting experiences. The highlight of my professional career, I suppose, was my giving a lecture in the University of Hanoi in 1986, to a totally hostile -- hostile audience, trying to persuade them to give up doing basic research, when they should do applied research, and you know, as I -- as I said, they we re totally hostile, not willing to listen. I -- as I said, in one state I was in the University of Hanoi lecturing 13 years before Mr. Clinton did so, and the atmosphe re was still very different then. But -- 88"

            "answer": "Regularly. Oh that\u2122s a very interesting experience, very worthwhile. In 1988, on the anniversary -- or was it the -- the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, they invited us back from my hometown, and we, the Jews, or a lot of us came back. My two brothers came from Israel with their wives. Everybody could bring one compan ion, my wife came along. And we -- I made a condition for coming back, we made that we were going to be allowed to lecture in the schools. And the people were so enthused about what we did, that they kept on inviting us again and again. I\u2122ve been there almost every second year, my younger brother, while he was alive, he s -- he died in the meantime, he went there back ever y year to lecture, and it was a very worthwhile experience. I insisted on not only lecturing on my war experience, and the Holocaust and all that, but also on Judaism, and the basic concepts of Judaism, which went down extremely well. It\u2122s a great privilege to do that."
