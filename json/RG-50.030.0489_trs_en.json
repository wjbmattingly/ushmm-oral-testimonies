This is tape number one, side A. Mr. Gans, would you please start by telling me your full name, and where and when you were born?",
            "answer": "Okay, my name is Manfred Gans. I was born in a little town in West Germany near the Dutch frontier, the name of that town 1s Borken, it\u2019s -- at the time it used to be called Borken in Westfarn -- in Westphalia. And I was born in there on the 27\" of April, 1922. My father\u2019s family had lived in that town at least since 1610. The town records showed that his -- the fa -- his -- his mother\u2019s family, by the name of Windmiller, were allowed to live inside the walled city of that town in 1610, which was very exceptional, because Jews generally were not allowed within walled ci -- cities."

But basically Jews had lived in that area, or in that town since sometime -- something like 1246. The exact history of the Jewish community has been reworked now, and is fully available in the -- in a group that has been formed in -- since 1988 in that town, who -- a small group of people who have occupied themselves with the history of the Jews. And they have fabulous documents about everything. So if you have to clear up something, this 1s where you can go, and anybody who wants to research the subject should go to these -- to these people."

            "answer": "There were -- about 25 Jewish families lived in the town itself. And there were Jewish families in every -- all the little villages around it. The town was a -- you know, was the county seat, and the -- all these other Jew -- little Jewish communities in the villages, some of them had their own synagogues, but none of them had schools. And -- so everybody had to come to -- to p- all the Jewish children had to come to Borken for the Jewish schools. We -- oh, I had one towa- want to mention one more thing which I -- this third thing is very important. So the Jews in a -- 1-in effect, had lived in this town for 750 years. And though it was a free town, that means it was- it was -- it had -- it was an independent town, which could make its own decisions, my father was the only Jew who was ever elected into the town council. There have been no Jews before that, and no Jews, of course, since that -- since itch -- there are no Jews living in the town now. Everybody emigrated, or perished in the Holocaust."

            "answer": "Okay. My father\u2019s name was Maurice Gans. He was born in 1885, and he went to -- like a -- all the Jewish kids in na -- in -- in the town, he went into the Jewish school for the first four years of his schooling, which we can suppo -- suppose we can calculate when that was. And then, at the age of 10, he went into the high school, which actually was a larger, Catholic school. And he graduated from there at the age of, I think about 16. He did -- he did not finish up as a full matriculation because there -- there was certain stages. And from there on s -- from then he -- he went into the textile trade, and he was an apprentice in a wholesale textile ware -- company in Frankfurt, 1-1-in -- in Germany. He -- when World War One broke out, he was a -- drafted into the German army. He was in Italy, and his unit was continuously short of food, and supplies, and he made it his business to go into the Italian towns and get provisions there.

He was extremely brave. He was lucky that he was sent to a Jewish home for recuperation in Switzerland because of having lost the lung. Of course the -- you know what -- the --the -- the -- he was treated as if he had tuberculosis, which he did not have, and there he got involved in founding a Jewish recuperation home. I think it was called Itania, which was Orthodox and had kosher food and all those -- those things. When he eventually returned to his hometown, he set up his own company, and my mother was his partner. Now, ma -- tell you a little bit about my mother, because she had a totally different background."

Then, of course when -- when the -- when the -- there were so many elections just before the Hitler period, and he of -- he was the chairman of the social democ -- democratic party in town.

He had his staff work on all the applications which were necessary so that these war orphans, war widows, and people who had -- war injured could apply to the various government offices for the support to which they were entitled. And he never charged anybody for all these services, and therefore he became very, very popular. His staff was -- his office staff, which was concerned, of course with wholesale textiles, was a-accustomed to service the members of the league of war orphans, widows, and people who had been injured in the war. Oh, I also started to tell about my mother\u2019s family, right? My mother\u2019s family lived in a little town called Falksen, which was near Hannover. And my grandfather, Maurice Frankel, had come from somewhere in the Brunswick area, Braunschweig at the time. He had set up his own business, and this is a town, he was a total free thinker, didn\u2019t believe in organized religion at all. But -- and his wife, my grandmother had the same attitude, but it doesn\u2019t mean that they were hiding the fact that they were Jews, they were not at all hiding, but they just didn\u2019t believe in organized religion. Their ideal were opera, and theater, German [indecipherable] you know, that sort of thing. In fact, one of the sisters of my grandfather was an actress in Hannover, and she was a paramour of the king of Hannover. She was very good looking. Even I remember her, though vaguely. And of course, I\u2019ve seen pictures of her. So, it was totally different type of upbringing, but nevertheless my mother also had to go to Hebrew school two or three times a week, in -- this was a town called Springer, which was a -- probably only about four or five miles away. There -- you know, in those days of course there were plenty of trains. They went to and fro by train all the time. So she too had a smattering of Jewish education. And then when she finished elementary school, her parents sent her to a finishing school, to Belgium, a Jewish finishing school where essentially ladies learned to be good housewife, and as a result my mother was an outstanding cook, very much oriented towards the French cuisine, which she had learned in -- in Belgium.

Now, my father was very successful in business, he was a -- always a financial genius. And -- and I think in the year 19 -- yeah, \u201935, just before my younger brother was born, he bought a very stately house, just outside the town of Borken, which had been built by a man who was the owner of a brick factory once, th-therefore they had -- they hadn\u2019t -- not spared any -- any expenses, any bricks, or anything like that.

At the time when my parents bought it, and it was not developed around it, gradually they, you know, they planted trees and bushes, and things like that. So we had two maids as servants, we had people looking after the vegetable gardens, and after the flower gardens. And above all, my father had a chauffeur, since he couldn\u2019t drive himself. He was always on the road for -- during the whole week. Usually he came back at night, sometimes he did not come back at night, but he usually came back at night and then went out again in the morning, into the rural district, to sell the specialty textiles to people who make custom clothing. So it -- it -- it -- 1 -- it wa-was certainly upper class. I think we had a higher standard of living than anything I have achieved since then, or my brothers have achieved since then. My older brother was called Karl, and he -- he was two years older than I. He\u2019s still alive now, he lives in Israel. Now he\u2019s called Gashom Kadar. He\u2019s changed his name during wor -- World War Two, when he was serving 1n a mixed Arab Jewish unit in the British army. And my younger brother, his name was Tayol, and when he went -- went -- went to Israel in 1950 -- let me see, he went to Israel in 1952. He too changed his name from Gans to Kadar.

            "answer": "Well the routine obviously was we go to school every day. Until the age of 10, we went to the Jewish school, Jewish elementary school, where we learned both the secular subjects and the basic parts of the Jewish service, including the translation of the five books of Moses and things like that. So w-we had a systematic education in learning classical Hebrew.

Now, th -- the routine at home was that we\u2019d all be in school until about one o\u2019clock and then came home and had the -- the main meal of the day. In the afternoon we were supposed to do our homework. Had some sort of other activities, we were essentially free. And the -- the -- yeah, the up -- of c-course it\u2019s -- is a -- home was essentially Orthodox. Not -- we wouldn\u2019t call this strictly Orthodox, call it like the modern Orthodox in the United States now here. And Friday evenings we would go to the service. After the service there would be a very festive meal. My -- my father would be home most of the time on s -- on Friday -- on the weekends. Saturday morning we would go to synagogue again. The synagogue would finish at about half past 10, 11 o\u2019clock. We then would go home and have a very festive breakfast, and after that we were obligated to go and visit our grandmother, my father\u2019s mother, who was living in town. And at that time she was beginning to be about 75 - 80 years old. And we had to visit her every Saturday. And after that we\u2019d go back to synagogue for the afternoon service, a -- which was at about one o\u2019clock, and about two o\u2019clock was the main meal, and in the evening at the end of the -- of the holiday, or Saturday, we would again go to synagogue and participated what\u2019s called the Havdalah service. So, it was a -- a life that revol-revolved largely around the Jewish religion. On Sunday we had to go to Sunday school, which was strictly devoted to Hebrew and Jewish history. The Jewish elementary school was a one room school with eight grades in it. Of course, we who -- whose parents were well off and could afford to send us to the high school only stayed in it for four years. But there were people -- Jewish kids in the school who -- whose parents could not afford to send them to high school, and who did all the eight grades in the -- in the one room school, this was a one room school. Which was very interesting because it -- it almost was like self education. There was only one teacher, and h-he would attend to all -- to everybody, set tasks for everybody.

More and more people were voting for Hitler, or voting for the right wing parties, some of which were eventually merged into the Nazi party. Another thing, another point I have to point out why all this was not so unexpected. When we visited my grandparents in Falksen near Hannover, they lived in -- ina town that was largely Protestant. And that town was very radically in with the Nazi before Hitler. So already in -- before Hitler, before 1933, when we went visiting there, there were a lot of kids who didn\u2019t play with us because we were Jews. And they were already converted.

There was no Hitler youth in our town, and every time they had a demonstration, they had to call out the high school, which included us, for all their -- their demonstration, and whatever they were celebrating at the time. Eventually my father got us out of there, we didn\u2019t have to attend those blasted ca -- wh-what -- what do they call it? It\u2019s called in German [indecipherable]. Had the torchlight parades and all that sort of things. We didn\u2019t have to go -- go along with that any more, but in the beginning we did, because the school just said everybody come tonight, there\u2019Il be a torchlight parade to celebrate this, that, and the other.

In fact they were from the part of Holland that borders on Germany. And -- but he -- he was -- he was very much aware of the Sephardic experience. And every time the word Spain was used, he spit.

And -- but h -- so we were very, very much aware of the fact that expulsion, flight, and all that sort of things was part of the Jewish tradition.

So again, everybody was Orthodox, so just was part again -- was accepted as being part and parcel of one\u2019s history. We had absolutely no identity crisis when all this came. People find that hard to believe, particularly I -- of course, later on in life, I came across a lot of Jews, who f -- German Jews, who were not brought up Orthodox, who had all sorts of clashes, including the -- the people who -- when someone was in the army, and people [indecipherable] working professionally, and who had -- who -- who were -- whose -- had terrific identity crisis of -- of -- wh-when hi -- Hitler came to power, and when they were excluded from the social life which they had practiced up to that time. But as I said -- of course, the other point was we couldn\u2019t socialize that well with other pe - with non-Jews, even before Hitler, because we were kosher, and we couldn\u2019t eat in their homes. And so it was -- it would be very rare if any of them would come to our homes, and eat with us. As one of my schoolmates told me back in -- in the 1988 -- 1992, when I went back to -- to the ha -- we first went back to our hometown, this -- we -- homes were not that comfortable in those days, and we all were friends because we played on the street.

My parents were still very much interested in literature, talking about s-sub -- subjects of culture. And they -- they did occasionally discuss what we should and should not do, and what we should and should not say in public. And -- and if you had to be cautious and all that. At a very early stage of 1933, of course they came and -- the police and the storm troopers came into our house, and they went through my father\u2019s library, but they weren\u2019t -- weren\u2019t enough educated to even find the books that -- that were of dubious background.

My father had always based this on the huge expense the 50 student school was for the town to support, and they said there should -- there should be a combination of that. Well would you believe that within two months after the Nazis came to power, they combined the two schools?

Again, I had to make it clear that I wouldn\u2019t work on Saturday, I wouldn\u2019t work on Friday afternoons, or would go home early on Friday afternoons. But they -- they didn\u2019t mind at all, they said, \u201cLook, if you don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t get paid. If you clock in and you clock out, and that\u2019s it.\u201d Initially the German Jewish aid committee subsidized my -- my salary a little bit, and after I found -- I had started working in this job, they told me in the home where we were, that I should go to a certain place, to a certain address where I would be able to make arrangements to finding a place -- permanent place to live, a lodging to -- to live. I went to this place, I had hardly changed from my work clothes, and I went to the right address, and to my great surprise I was in -- at a beautiful estate, very rich, obviously very rich people. I didn\u2019t know what it was all about, but I was hope [indecipherable] the right address. It turned out that my friend Mr. Jacobs had made arrangements for this very well-to-do family to go and be introduced to me. These were the Steinats. They were, you know, the Laskeys, the famous Laskeys were the richest family in Manchester, Jewish family in Manchester. And the Steinats were the second richest families. And they were -- s-started my relationship with that -- that family.

So you see it\u2019s just all -- all a question of connection with -- and it was very important in England, everything 1s c- connection. It\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s whom you know. And the Steinats made arrangements for me to be billeted, to -- to -- to rent a room from a lady who had been the second driver of Mr. Steinats father. Mr. Steinats hated her like the guts. He didn\u2019t like her at all. But it came in handy for me to -- to live there, and I lived there with another German Jewish man, who was two years older than I, and -- and there was a very old man also living there as a lodger. Now, this lady rented rooms, and she provided meals. It was pretty primitive, but all right, I -- I didn\u2019t [indecipherable] I d -- the -- the job which I had accepted, w-w-was technically very good, but it again, the circumstances of -- of cleanliness, and toilet facilities were just d-disgusting. But I th - | thought this 1s part of living like this, and I was living on the -- during the week I was living in the poverty of a working class atmosphere, and on weekends I was going to the Steinats for practically all my meals, and living in a very, very high class atmosphere. Undoubtedly the Steinats were richer even than my father was. And I -- I thought it was greater -- a great experience. So I -- I think I have to take another trip to the toilet."

Of course, everybody thought the war was going to break out immediately then, but I -- I was sure it wouldn\u2019t. Because now the attitude of France and England changed, and they started sending their foreign ministers to Moscow to try and get a er-great alliance with the Russians going.

So nothing much happened politically, every -- except that everybody was sure that eventually there would be a war. But the -- these two elephants were not in -- on the way yet. Then on Shavuot, 1939, I was at the Steinats again, and so I mentions that I had just -- had bu -- gotten a chief rabbi from Manchester, Dr. Altman, who was, not to me, but to other people, a well known rabbi from Berlin. Quite young, he was in middle 30\u2019s, or -- at the time, and sa -- for the [indecipherable] after the synagogue ceremony, th -- the Steinats had invited Dr. Altman and his wife, together with a few other very prominent people of the Jewish community. The day was glorious, the weather was glorious, the food was incredible. Of course it had to be non-meat, being Shavuot, and this is where I came to know Dr. Altman, who later on became the head of the -- head of the Institute of Advanced Jewish Studies at Brandeis University. And he -- we became friends right there and then, and he is being -- he being -- he was my mentor, from whom I learned an awful lot, until the time he died in, I don\u2019t know, some times in the 80\u2019s. He was professor at Harvard, same time professor at Jerusalem University. And but that\u2019s -- basically he was a fantastic thinker, with tremendous ideas, and I attended a lot of lectures which he gave, mostly in Manchester, and then later on here, in this country. And he set me on a path of -- of studies, and views that have sur -- very much influenced my life and gave me a much deeper understanding of Judaism than I could have possibly gotten in any other way. So that was sometime on May, 1930 -- ?39. And then, actually on -- so then, in beginning of September, 1939, it suddenly transpired that Germany had made a pact with the Soviet Union, or the Soviet Union had made a pact with Germany that they were going to divide up Poland between the two of them.

England declared war on the following Sunday, this was -- September first was a Friday, and England declared war on a -- on a Sunday night. And I happened to be at the Steinats at that time, listen -- listened to the speech which Chamberlain made, over the radio, which he pointed out that I ca -- I -- I wish I had the -- the exact text of this.

Well, one day I remember we had a -- they were -- they had a fo -- a race, a su -- sort of like a sports day, and the -- you know, running a 400 meter, you know, this is actually one round on -- and that was the major event there. And of course there were all these guys there who had been such champions in all their Maccabee clubs, and God knows, all over the place. Well, I did the run, and I won it so easily. And now I had made my name, you know. I -- I -- I hadn\u2019t realized myself how -- how -- how f -- much better I was at sports than all these people who were so -- boasting continuously about their powers, you know?

I want to tell you a story which is very, very interesting, I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve not told it before. When we were in the Isle of Mann in the inte -- internment camp -- as I said, we were Orthodox Jews living together, there was a man there by -- he was the son of Rabbi Spitzer from Hamburg. Rabbi Spitzer from Hamburg was known as a great Talmudist, very ultra-Orthodox who had come out of Hungary to become a- arabbi, chief rabbi of -- of Hamburg, in Germany. His son was regarded to be far superior to the father, as far as brain and knowledge was concerned. And one day t -- one day to the other, the son decided that a rabbinical career was not for him, and he wanted to go into law. He knew Talmudic law fantastically, and he then went and became -- took his legal papers in Germany. Of course he couldn\u2019t practice by the time he\u2019d finished. So, you know, he couldn\u2019t be a lawyer, Jewish lawyer in Germany any more. But he was with me in there, in the same house in which I was in -- on the Isle of Mann.

Extremely well versed. I mean, a lot of the things which I have learned, attitudes which I have taken on Halachak and Jewish law, I\u2019ve learned from him.

I was assigned together with a fellow by the name of Morris Latimer, whose -- and the Sergeant Major of the troop, O\u2019 Neill, and a fellow by the name of Tommy sw-Swenton. These are all these cover names of course. Morris Latimer, for instance, was Morris Levi from the Sudetenland before he joined that troop. So we were assigned to 41 [indecipherable] Marine commando. And we were held in camps for I think two or three weeks while we were being briefed about the landing. And w -- we couldn\u2019t communicate with anybody outside because those -- they were -- didn\u2019t tell us where we would land. We knew -- we had -- we saw maps, for which people who really knew France well could have guessed where this was. But I\u2019m -- we personally, we didn\u2019t know where it was going to be. We didn\u2019t know we were going to land in Normandy. So we were in these camps for about two or three weeks, and then one evening, total darkness, we were -- we embarked into little boats, infantry landing boats, which had -- each boat had maybe something like 80 people. And the -- all flotilla set out without light, without any intercommunication, in a pitch dark night. And as far as I know there were no -- no accidents. We sailed past the Isle of Wight in total darkness, couldn\u2019t see anything at all. And -- and that was it. The sea was not too rough, it was acceptable, and we -- as we approached, as we came closer to the coast in the morning, well, it must have been about six or seven o\u2019clock in the morning by the time we landed. But before that we could start to see the massive bombardment of the coast, and the shooting back of -- of the -- of the German guns back to us. And one of us always sat on the steps, so that s -- way you could look out and sort of gave a running commentary on what was happening, what he was seeing, and soon -- of course pretty soon the German [indecipherable] guns started -- the shells started falling nearer to us. Lucky tha -- luckily we were not hit. And now, before all this, while we were in the camps, Montgomery, the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Get off the beaches. You can -- don\u2019t,\u201d -- and that struck me as being very, very significant. The really tr-trust that the British have in their Navy, that I could see that the soldiers wouldn\u2019t get away from the beach. And I was absolutely set I was not going to let this happen to me. So, when -- when the -- the -- the -- our boat approached the -- the coast -- and of course as I said, we now were under direct fire -- as soon as I could, I run down the gangway, and I got -- got down -- was on the beach, and lo and behold, I saw about 25 German soldiers who had been taken prisoner by the engineer\u2019s unit that has preceded us, who were supposed to blow up the obstacles, the anti- tank obstacles that were on the beach. And so I run over to those Germans, and I say to them, \u2018\u201c\u2018Where\u2019s the pass through the minefields?\u201d Well, you know, at that time -- a few days later I didn\u2019t have any fear of mines any more, but at that time I still was very much aware. And lo and behold, when I didn\u2019t threaten them, and, you know, about being -- talking their own language, the first thing that occurred to me is these guys look exactly like us German Jews. Different uniform and they could be on our side. And lo and behold they told me. I didn\u2019t threaten them, I had the tommy gun down. I just said, in a very calm way, \u201cWhere\u2019s the pass through the mine fields?\u201d And they pointed it out to me. And so I gathered as many people as I could, and I\u2019d gotten through the -- gotten off the beach, and gotten into Lyon sur Mer without a single casualty. So the -- the -- the -- that -- that was, that part of it, that was off, and actually we lost 50 percent of the unit. Out of 450 people we lost 50 percent on that day. Later on, when we made the landing in Washoe, in -- which was much more heavily defended than the Normandy beaches, much more heavily defended, we lost, out of 450 people, we lost 11 people in the landing. But by that time we were so experienced that nobody could come equal to us. And This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Luckily, the pass through the mine field was at one end of Lyon sur Mer, and the German strong point was in the other. I had no doubt where we were. You know, we had studied the maps sufficiently. I knew we were at the other end, we had nothing to be afraid of, not until we would get to the strong point. Obviously the Germans are go -- going to be in their strong points. Why should they be out on the road, in the French villages? The French who have murdered them, you know? So, the first thing, I gather up a few guys, we started making our way along the road that was le -- going towards the German strong point. But, you know, you -- you cannot be out in the streets, I -- and- when it -- when it comes to -- when there\u2019s so much artillery fire and mortar fire. It\u2019s -- the splinters will carry. So you have to go from one door to the other, dive in and dive out. And of course the population was on our side. They willingly opened the doors for us. So I says you know, you couldn\u2019t do this in Germany. We knew that we would never be able to do this type of street fighting in Germany, and we didn\u2019t intend to do it, and the British high command saw to it- had come to the same conclusion. So we were diving from one house into the other. In some houses actually there were people who had been quite badly injured, with all the bombardment by one side or the other. In fact as -- as we got out, you know, to the road first, there were some British soldiers who had obviously been killed by being out on the street when the -- when a shell exploded. You know, y-you cannot stay out under these conditions. So we worked our way- a few of us worked our way towards the strong point. When we got into this position where we This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And I went upstairs and tried to look out and look into the strong point, but some German sniper must have seen me there, and he fired at me, but thank God he missed. So I rushed downstairs again. I think I -- so I went down into the house, and we were sort of milling around, deciding what to do next, when we heard a loud bang on the house next door. And ta -- so -- obviously some missile was going from our side into the strong point. So we really didn\u2019t know what the hell this was. We were absolutely sure that apart from our -- our people there could be nobody there. So we went there, and we found an Arab, who had the typical look of what the -- how the Germans portrayed the Jews, you know, black hair, crooked nose and all that. And he had a 19 [indecipherable] war front loader rifle, which he somehow had gotten hold of, and he was firing this into the German strong point. So -- because nobody spoke French, ik -- yeah, my own French was very deficient in those days, I now speak French much better [indecipherable] transfer two years in the meantime. But we persuaded him that he should join us, which he gladly did. And he was with us for -- until the winter of 1944 -- \u00b045. So, after that, the colonel of the unit wanted me to go with him and look at all the different positions which the different troops of 41 commandos had now taken up around the German strong point. And I went with him. And he was one of those guys who wouldn\u2019t take no notice of any German fire. He was running around with a briefcase. His name, I think, was Colonel Grey, but he spelled it with e-y, and not a-y like I did. And he -- he wouldn\u2019t throw himself down and her -- heard an artillery shell come over, and we heard a mortar come, and -- and [indecipherable] but I wasn\u2019t going to do this, so I dodged the way I\u2019d learned to dodge it, and as a matter of fact the next day the colonel was severely injured, he was This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So, so much for somebody taking such incredible risks, were totally unjustified. But then we had -- I -- a troop of South African armored vehicles came up and came into the village from the beach, and the colonel persuaded them to make a straight attack along the main road to -- on -- on to the German strong point. Which was crazy. The way we did this later on, we used armored vehicles, and even tanks, only as mobile guns. We had them -- h-hid them somewhere in the field, and had them shoot and lay down covering fire while we went in. Anyhow, this attack totally failed. I didn\u2019t participate in it because I knew it would -- would be practically suicide to do that. But there was one of the troops of 41 [indecipherable] commando, Y troop, and they lost about half the troop of what they still had, in trying to do this attack, because as we knew well from our -- from the maps we had been given before D-Day, there was a German [indecipherable] tank pointing right down the road. There was no chance that an armored car could get by that. So we hadn\u2019t -- we hadn\u2019t -- we had not succeeded in taking the strong point on that day. By now it was getting late. We were in a -- on a farm outside Lyon somewhere, and I also was getting extremely hungry, and I -- I found myself of -- a ditch that had a sort of stone lining on both sides, which I took cover, and start -- started to prepare some of the food which we had, it was -- I hadn\u2019t eaten all day long. I don\u2019t think we had eaten during the night either. There was cocoa. There was -- I mean, there were drinks available, but I -- I didn\u2019t take strong drinks because they slow down your reaction too much. And jus -- just at that time, the -- there was a magnificent sight of massive numbers of allied gliders, British gliders come -- being pulled by airplanes coming over, to land on the other side of Lyon canal, and they were sort of -- you know, you could see them being detached, going on their own, and coming down.

            "answer": "So this shows that things were proceeding along the way they were planned. Also, by this time a German fighter came over and flew right along the beaches. And you know it says in the book the longest day? That\u2019s -- he got away with it, nobody shot at him, but that wasn\u2019t true, lots of people shot at him, of course, nu -- none of us hit him. But, you know, it -- one fighter alone could not make much of a difference, probably sent in to scare people off, but it didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t -- it wouldn\u2019t work in our case. So this was the first -- this was D-Day, it was the end of D-Day. I slept very well that night in my ditch. I needed it. Next morning, we continued what we were supposed to do on D-Day, we were supposed to conquer German headquarters, move it inland. We were supposed to get the Lyon sur Mer strong point, and we were supposed to get into Luc sur Mer. We had to -- not succeeded doing in any idle -- any of these things. So, next morning the first thing we -- it was decided we\u2019 ll attack the German headquarters in -- inland. Well, that didn\u2019t tu-turn -- it wasn\u2019t much of a headquarters. This happens to be a battalion that had just come from the Russian front and they were pretty decimated. And we decided we were not going to go with covering fire, we were just going to run in and surprise them, and s -- which came off beautifully. And s -- I found three Germans there who were obviously volgama -- the Germans call volgadeutshe, the German nationals from -- from Russia or Poland, they\u2019re -- very hard to understand them. I tried to get some more information from them, but they proved t- totally useless. So then I turned around to take part in the attack on the Luc sur Mer strong point- the Lyon sur Mer strong point, but by the time I arrived there, the strong point had given up.

And he managed to apparently get -- infiltrate his people into the strong point, and get the strong point to surrender. So we went on, and the next stage was very simple. We got into Luc sur Mer very easily, and this -- this was the far end of the British Canadian landing, and now we were at the border of the American and British beach head.

I\u2019m also interested, especially when you were able to get Germans to surrender, were you able to learn important information from them along the way?",
            "answer": "I can say that important information that had strategic significance, I ca -- don\u2019t think I ever -- ever was in that position.

Now, I must say that I know of others who j -- of -- from [indecipherable] commando, who had tried this and did not succeed in -- and -- and -- and who got killed in one of these attempts, and I almost was in a similar situation, too. Well, the -- after we -- we -- after this D-Day experience, we had a rather unique experience besieging two underground German radar stations. They had been left behind in the allied advance, and they were fully manned, and they were hev -- very, very heavily fortified, incredibly heavily fortified. And it was just decided that it was not worthwhile to make an attack -- a direct attack on them. So we were positioned around them, near -- near This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

The -- the tra -- the trouble was that the allies were building -- had planned to build an air -- airp -- airport, an air [indecipherable] abou -- only about maybe a mile away from these radar stations. And that plan had to go ahead, you know, there were fields there that were suitable for landing aircrafts on it, and this had to go ahead. And they couldn\u2019t take any notice of the fact that these ger -- these underground fortifications were still there. So our task was to make them believe that they were just about to be attacked. And -- which we -- which we successfully managed to do for about a week or so. There were a lot of adventures that we had, where we did things that were totally wrong, that you would never have done a month or two later when we had much more experience. But luckily most of the time we were -- we got away with it. Eventually enough equipment was saved for us -- spared for us that we could do a daylight attack on it, and -- and it was successful. Again, I managed to get these guys out, to surrender. So you had -- we took 450 people prisoner on -- on that day, and we marched them down to the beach, to the -- t-to -- to the prisoner camps of which there were there, but we shipped out. That was an interesting experience which I\u2019ve written up in great detail. If you want to read, you can read it. After that experience, we went to the -- what we might call the eastern front of the Normandy beach head, which was on -- we -- we were in the part that was hev -- very heavily fortified, which was still the extension of what the Germans call the Atlantic wall.

You rely on the fact that they\u2019re not going to shoot at a single vehicle.

So I think we were just finishing up talking about when you were interrogating Germans, and I was wondering if you had any other feelings or encounters with not the -- those who had been high S:S. officials, but sort of more the ordinary Germans, and if there were any kind of different feelings you had, or did you kind of hold them responsible in the same way\u201d?",
            "answer": "I wa -- while I was -- the short time I was an -- actually a military [indecipherable], I -- of course I met a lot of ordinary Germans, and it -- I didn\u2019t have any prejudice against them. I was willing to judge people on the basis of who they -- what they were, and who they were. It was the- | -- we were go -- gotten quite friendly, I mean not friendly from the point of view of fraternization, but ma -- with s -- with some of the Germans who were obviously had been -- not been [indecipherable] Nazis, and who were constructive. We had to work for them. Certainly in military government we did. Then, of course, they made the rule, very wisely, that no extra -- extra Jew, or extra [indecipherable] could be in military government. It would be a very good idea if the United States had the same rule for Iraq now. It -- it -- it just 1s -- became -- was a bit of a shock that we had to leave military government, one day to the other, but I think it was an extremely wise decision. They wanted to show the military how -- the British authorities and American authorities wanted to show -- no, I think it\u2019s only the British who did this, they wanted to show that they had confidence in the political leaders who were coming up wer -- like Adenauer and Schumacher, who were now coming up in Germany, and that they would not be sidetracked by anybody who had been -- who had left the country and who had not gone through the same experience as these political leaders had gone through.

            "answer": "Yeah, yeah, it\u2019s hard for -- it\u2019s hard for non-technical people to realize that, but the fact of the matter is that I\u2019ve had a few -- if -- if -- as I\u2019ve done, if you put a large chemical plant on line, with a new process, new, untried equipment, and all that sort of thing, the -- the experience is more telling than almost anything I\u2019d done in the war.
