But he was a businessman, and so he gave us what was required, probably still is, an affidavit. And then my mother\u2019s brother Walter, Walter Lowen(ph), he changed his name from Lowenthal to Lowen(ph), he lived in Seattle, and he gave us another statement. What they wanted is a statement saying we would not become wards of the state. That\u2019s really what it amounted to.

The \u2014 the consul general in Marseilles, whose name just came to my mind, was Fullerton. Mr. Fullerton was abiding by these instructions, and on his staff he had vice-consul Hiram Bingham, and who had a sidekick whose name was Miles Standish. If you want to be American, you can\u2019t get more American than Hiram Bingham and Miles Standish. And they were on their own. They, on their own, decided. They met the refugees.

Oh, that\u2019s my mother-in-law from Georgia, and the taxi waved them on. He was an American consul, so they thought he had some authority.

And the intelligence office had to issue security passes, as much as you could check anybody. We had a big headquarters that was in the middle of town. The air force didn\u2019t bomb it, so we\u2019d have a nice place to stay. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true, by the way, and \u2014 because everything else was flat, except this wonderful building \u2014 it became our headquarters.

With the 24\" class, because of the \u2014 how far the war had progressed, they didn\u2019t do that any more. So I went in the war as a private. But then, once I was over there, they \u2014 they \u2014 well, they promoted me to corporal, and I \u2014 I had also applied at Ritchie to join the counter-intelligence corps, because that\u2019s what I wanted.

But then, once I was in Bremen, and I applied again to get into the counter-intelligence corps, and they accepted me. So, in the last six months I was over there, I became a special agent of the counter-intelligence corps, no insignia of rank, just two U.S.s, so that you could go to see some colonel, and chew him about what somebody in his outfit was doing, and without him knowing what your rank was, even though if you were 20 years old, they knew that you weren\u2019t a general.

But when I was at Syracuse in \u00b048, I got a letter from the same colonel, he didn\u2019t know the c \u2014 the con \u2014 the connection, but he said, we\u2019re interested, if you would like to become a second lieutenant, military intelligence reserve, and he gave me the conditions. And you had to have been a staff sergeant, when I was a sergeant, which is one rank below the staff sergeant. So I wrote him back and I say, well, colonel, I appreciate, but I\u2019m only a sergeant, I\u2019m not a staff sergeant, so I don\u2019t qualify. But, if you are interested in knowing whether you think that I am qualified, if you\u2019re the same Colonel Stevens that came to Bremen, Germany and interviewed me in \u201946, and asked me to accept a commission, then you must know that I am qualified, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have interviewed me. And he send me the same paper back, handwritten on there, I\u2019m the same guy, you\u2019ll hear from me. And about three or four weeks later, I got a handwritten note from him, and says, apply under army regulation so and so, so and so.

I mean, you have a history and experience that is so unique, with German Jews, who escaped, left, fled. You know, whatever verb we would choose, who left Germany, and then came back. There are some, but very few, who came back to have such thorough knowledge of the country in their postwar years. Yours starts now, right after World War II, but then later goes on to have a \u2014 a career in \u2014 in intelligence with the Americans, for several decades. What did \u2014 what did you learn in those decades? I mean, there has to be a process, through which a \u2014 a human being goes, when they \u2014 and \u2014 or they see someone they love, like their father, who suffered so much from the hands of a system, that was adopted by a country. Was there a time in this process where your feelings and your thoughts about Germany changed?

            "answer": "Well, my initial reaction \u2014 initial initial, in Bremen, was exemplified by the following; I walked down the street in Bremen one day, and there was a man beating his kid. And I was in American uniform. And I walked up to him and said, stop it. We\u2019re bringing democracy to you, in a democracy you don\u2019t beat your kid on the street. That was my immediate reaction. How do you get to the Germans? How do you get them away from this business of \u2014 of punishment, of \u2014 of beating, of harshness, and so on? So, all I could do at that moment was that. Gradually, the young generation, you \u2014 you know, there \u2014 you had to wait for a while. Germany was rebuilt amazingly fast, thanks to the Marshall Plan, and many other things. And the Germans are, undoubtedly, very astute, and \u2014 what\u2019s the word I\u2019m trying to think of \u2014 people. They \u2014 they work very hard, to this day. There are always exceptions, but generally speaking. They\u2019re well organized, they \u2014 they keep their nose to the erindstone, and \u2014 and they were lucky with the initial governments they got, you \u2014 you know, when you get a Konrad Adenauer, who was no pansy, who \u2014 who \u2014 who ran Germany pretty harshly, but that built everything up, and then he was followed by Erhard to fix the economy, and then of course, you had Willy Brandt, who was a socialist, and brought a lot of social things to Germany. They \u2014 they had some very good leaders. I can\u2019t think of one chancellor of Germany that was really bad. They had a couple of presidents, but presidents don\u2019t matter. They\u2019re \u2014 they were figureheads, like the queen of England. It\u2019s the chancellors who run the show.  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Ralph Hockley \"7 January 12, 2016 So, gradually the young generations there, they went through all kinds of stuff. The universities tended to be very liberal, to use a kind word. And so a lot of the students got pretty left-wingish. But gradually, this stuff was drummed into them, what it is like to be in democracy, and what \u2014 what happened is they \u2014 they \u2014 because there\u2019s been such a tremendous change in the way the world operates, that all they want \u2014 the young people want to do is go \u2014 come to America, or France, or \u2014 you know, they been \u2014 they were locked up in Germany, they couldn\u2019t get out of Germany, under Hitler. And so it \u2014 suddenly, there was some freedom of travel, and they saw that there were other societies, that weren\u2019t as bad as they were made out to be. And the people went to Brittany on vacation, instead of staying in Germany, saw that it was nice in Brittany, or wherever they went. Half of Germany\u2019s been to \u2014 to the Canary Islands, and to Spain, because \u2014 because they love the sun, primarily, but that\u2019s another \u2014 another world down there. So they \u2014 they \u2014 they passed a constitution, which is very democracy oriented, and they have a Supreme Court that is enforcing it. And it\u2019s not always to our liking, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. I \u2014I always try to take people for who \u2014 the individual qualities, and what they were like, and their \u2014 I said, I met a lot of nice people. There are a lot of nice people in Germany.
