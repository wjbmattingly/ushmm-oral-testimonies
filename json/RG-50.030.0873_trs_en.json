There was my mother\u2019s sister, Elsa(ph) and Charlie Heiman(ph), who had only been in the United States since 1939, I believe, so they weren\u2019t that well established in 1940 \u2014 \u201941. But he was a businessman, and so he gave us what was required, probably still is, an affidavit. And then my mother\u2019s brother Walter, Walter Lowen(ph), he changed his name from Lowenthal to Lowen(ph), he lived in Seattle, and he gave us another statement. What they wanted is a statement saying we would not become wards of the state. That\u2019s really what it amounted to. And so we had these, and the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the consulate ha \u2014 the consul, in charge of consul affairs had to \u2014 had to decide whether it was enough, or not, semicolon; the policy in Washington was not to give Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Ralph Hockley \u201d January 12, 2016 any visas. Cordell Hull was Secretary of State, and he had a sidekick who was worse, and their policy was not to give visas to refugees. Jewish refugees, I can\u2019t tell you exactly, but that was the policy. The \u2014 the consul general in Marseilles, whose name just came to my mind, was Fullerton. Mr. Fullerton was abiding by these instructions, and on his staff he had vice-consul Hiram Bingham, and who had a sidekick whose name was Miles Standish. If you want to be American, you can\u2019t get more American than Hiram Bingham and Miles Standish. And they were on their own. They, on their own, decided. They met the refugees. Miles Standish and Bingham went to Saint Nicolas camp, and \u2014 and got the Lion Feuchtwanger out while he was washing himself at the creek, a-and they \u2014 they \u2014 they had a taxi standing nearby. They \u2014 they quickly changed him into a woman, and had him sit in the back of the seat. And when the police stopped the taxi, they said, who is that in the back? Oh, that\u2019s my mother-in-law from Georgia, and the taxi waved them on. He was an American consul, so they thought he had some authority. And that\u2019s how they got him out of there, but you could have access to \u2014 to Saint Nicolas, in Niemes.

And so, there was a ship on the sixth of May, the Winnipeg, and there was a ship on the 10\" of May, the Wyoming. And so, you had to get ship\u2019s passage, which wasn\u2019t a given.

And the president \u2014 they didn\u2019t start at the bottom, they went to the president of the French line. And the president of the French line said, we \u2014 we have no more cabins. And Herbert Lagler said, well, our staff members will take any accommodation.

And then we had to get the papers from the French police prefecture, for exit visa and the transit visa. And this is where the story always gets me, is that we knew that on the second floor of the house, the apartment house we lived in, there was a lady, middle- aged lady, who lived with her aunt and uncle, they were Corsicans.

So he was the G2 Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Ralph Hockley _ January 12, 2016 intelligence officer, and I was on his staff. And the intelligence office had to issue security passes, as much as you could check anybody. We had a big headquarters that was in the middle of town. The air force didn\u2019t bomb it, so we\u2019d have a nice place to stay. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true, by the way, and \u2014 because everything else was flat, except this wonderful building \u2014 it became our headquarters. And so everybody that worked in that headquarters, because we needed German \u2014 we couldn\u2019t do everything ourselves, we needed clerical staff, and so on. We, in our office, we had no German clerks, because it was security. But everybody else did. And so our office was \u2014 had the job of \u2014 of getting them the passes. Since I was the only person in the office who spoke German, it\u2019s \u2014 I was the contact guy. And they also \u2014 they send me up to Bremerhaven for a couple weeks to \u2014 to handle the security office at the \u2014 at the port up there.

They \u2014 they \u2014 they take these guys, they send them to Fort Benning, make them infantry officers in 90 days, which usually it took six months, or whatever. And so you could go from Ritchie to Benning to become a 90 day wonder, and then come back as a second lieutenant, they had that, too. With the 24\" class, because of the \u2014 how far the war had progressed, they didn\u2019t do that any more. So I went in the war as a private. But then, once I was over there, they \u2014 they \u2014 well, they promoted me to corporal, and I \u2014 I had also applied at Ritchie to join the counter-intelligence corps, because that\u2019s what I wanted. I wanted to catch Nazis. That\u2019s what they were doing. But they told me I was too young, so I didn\u2019t get into the CIC, you had to be older. But then, once I was in Bremen, and I applied again to get into the counter-intelligence corps, and they accepted me. So, in the last six months I was over there, I became a special agent of the counter-intelligence corps, no insignia of rank, just two U.S.s, so that you could go to see some colonel, and chew him about what somebody in his outfit was doing, and without him knowing what your rank was, even though if you were 20 years old, they knew that you weren\u2019t a general. So, I sa \u2014I\u2014I did that. And it\u2019s actually as a result of that, that I \u2014 ultimately when I was in Syracuse University, I got a commission military intelligence, because the gentleman that \u2014 before I left, when my time wa \u2014 came to https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 147 Interview with Ralph Hockley January 12, 2016 go home, I was interviewed by a colonel from intelligence headquarters in the States, asked me if I wouldn\u2019t stay as a warrant officer, or as an officer.

But when I was at Syracuse in \u00b048, I got a letter from the same colonel, he didn\u2019t know the c \u2014 the con \u2014 the connection, but he said, we\u2019re interested, if you would like to become a second lieutenant, military intelligence reserve, and he gave me the conditions. And you had to have been a staff sergeant, when I was a sergeant, which is one rank below the staff sergeant. So I wrote him back and I say, well, colonel, I appreciate, but I\u2019m only a sergeant, I\u2019m not a staff sergeant, so I don\u2019t qualify. But, if you are interested in knowing whether you think that I am qualified, if you\u2019re the same Colonel Stevens that came to Bremen, Germany and interviewed me in \u201946, and asked me to accept a commission, then you must know that I am qualified, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have interviewed me. And he send me the same paper back, handwritten on there, I\u2019m the same guy, you\u2019ll hear from me. And about three or four weeks later, I got a handwritten note from him, and says, apply under army regulation so and so, so and so. I did, and within six months I was a second lieutenant, military intelligence reserve."

They\u2019re well organized, they \u2014 they keep their nose to the erindstone, and \u2014 and they were lucky with the initial governments they got, you \u2014 you know, when you get a Konrad Adenauer, who was no pansy, who \u2014 who \u2014 who ran Germany pretty harshly, but that built everything up, and then he was followed by Erhard to fix the economy, and then of course, you had Willy Brandt, who was a socialist, and brought a lot of social things to Germany. They \u2014 they had some very good leaders. I can\u2019t think of one chancellor of Germany that was really bad. They had a couple of presidents, but presidents don\u2019t matter. They\u2019re \u2014 they were figureheads, like the queen of England. It\u2019s the chancellors who run the show.

The universities tended to be very liberal, to use a kind word. And so a lot of the students got pretty left-wingish. But gradually, this stuff was drummed into them, what it is like to be in democracy, and what \u2014 what happened is they \u2014 they \u2014 because there\u2019s been such a tremendous change in the way the world operates, that all they want \u2014 the young people want to do is go \u2014 come to America, or France, or \u2014 you know, they been \u2014 they were locked up in Germany, they couldn\u2019t get out of Germany, under Hitler. And so it \u2014 suddenly, there was some freedom of travel, and they saw that there were other societies, that weren\u2019t as bad as they were made out to be. And the people went to Brittany on vacation, instead of staying in Germany, saw that it was nice in Brittany, or wherever they went.

So they \u2014 they \u2014 they passed a constitution, which is very democracy oriented, and they have a Supreme Court that is enforcing it. And it\u2019s not always to our liking, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. I \u2014I always try to take people for who \u2014 the individual qualities, and what they were like, and their \u2014 I said, I met a lot of nice people. There are a lot of nice people in Germany.

Of course, she was born in East Germany, and she didn\u2019t come to Germany until after the wall came down, and it became one Germany. She\u2019s probably very good at her job, but in this case, I would, as a former intelligence official, I would say that taking in a million Muslims, or foreigners \u2014 doesn\u2019t have to be Muslims \u2014 at one time, is something which a democracy can\u2019t handle.
