Let\u2122s \u0152 the book on Les Milles says about the 20 th of May, I \u0152 of June \u0152 I don\u2122t believe it, it\u2122s \u0152 had to be a few days earlier, it just doesn\u2122t fit \u0152 they took \u0152 not everybody, but they took all the volunteers in Les Milles who felt threatened by the Nazis, and is \u0152 and the \u0152 the comman \u0152 commandant of Les Milles , who had some good sides to him.

He called him up, and says, I w \u0152 I need a train.

Oh, that\u2122s my mother-in-law from Georgia, and the taxi waved them on. He was an American consul, so they thought he had some authority.

And there I had to, you know, ask \u0152 there was a Miss Houligan (ph), who was kind of the administrative person there, she was a nice person. And I told her that Hiram Bingham wanted to see me, and so she took me in to see him. And he said to me, you know, th-the Quakers highly recommend you and your family. I \u0152 I know your dad is at Gurs , and we\u2122re ready to issue you visas.

And so he \u0152 he \u0152 he said, I\u2122m giving you a letter, addressed to the commandant at \u0152 at Gurs , whoever\u2122s in charge, and saying \u0152 on American si \u0152 consulate stationery, saying that we\u2122re prepared to issue your family a visa, and the chances are 50-50 that they\u2122ll let him go.

The \u0152 the \u0152 so we get \u0152 Dad came back, so we had to get out, okay? So the debate became, how do you get out? You could \u0152 you had two options; you could go through Spain . There was a guy by the name of Francisco Franco there, who could have caused you a hard Interview with Ralph Hockley January 12, 2016 114 time, you didn\u2122t know. Or, you could take a ship from Marseilles to the West Indies . Now, there weren\u2122t that many ships, but th-they \u0152 there were some. And so we decided okay, so we worked, from the point of view, when was our ship going? And so, there was a ship on the sixth of May, the Winnipeg , and there was a ship on the 10th of May, the Wyoming . And so, you had to get ship\u2122s passage, which wasn\u2122t a given. You needed an exit visa from France , and you needed a transit visa for the French West Indies , and you needed ship\u2122s passage. And so we started working on that. The Quakers, the \u0152 Herbert Lagler , the number two guy at the Quakers, called the president of the French line, and said, we have four members of our staff \u0152 note the \u0152 the wording \u0152 who are ready to go to the States , we need four bunks, passages, whatever. And the president \u0152 they didn\u2122t start at the bottom, they went to the president of the French line. And the president of the French line said, we \u0152 we have no more cabins. And Herbert Lagler said, well, our staff members will take any accommodation. Which meant the hold of the ship, because these ships were not passenger ships, they had ca \u0152 they were freighters with some cabins. And so they had turned the \u0152 the hold into receptacles for human beings. And say \u0152 our quo \u0152 our members will \u0152 will take whatever you got. So, okay.

And then we had to get the papers from the French police prefecture, for exit visa and the transit visa. And this is where the story always gets me, is that we knew that on the second floor of the house, the apartment house we lived in, there was a lady, middle aged lady, who lived with her aunt and uncle, they were Corsicans. They were called Giglielmi (ph) Morachini (ph). And we knew her \u0152 them \u0152 we didn\u2122t know her aunt and uncle at all, but \u0152 and I can\u2122t tell you whether her name was Giglielmi (ph), or Morachini (ph). But, be that as it may. And \u0152 but we knew she worked for the French police prefecture. So my mother and I went, rang her doorbell. And all we knew about her was from saying, bonjour Madame , as we went higher up than she lived, as she came out the door. And we said, Madame, we understand that you work at the police prefecture, and this is our situation. We have visa for the United States , we\u2122re leaving, we need a French exit visa, and transit visa, and can you help us with that? She said yes. And she said, I will bring you the papers tomorrow, to fill out. So, she \u0152 next day we saw her, and she \u0152 she gave us some questionnaires to fill out, and we filled them out. Rang her doorbell, and said, here are the papers. Okay, I will let you know when I get the answer. Few days later she contacted us, and she said, the Interview with Ralph Hockley January 12, 2016 116 papers are ready, and \u0152 but you have to go pick them up yourself, because you have to get a stamp, and they \u0152 they put \u0152 paste the stamp on there, like a postage stamp, but it\u2122s a fee, or whatever. So I went there, and I picked up the papers, and again they asked me who I was, and I said, I\u2122m the messenger. And I gave them the money they wanted, and you know, they don\u2122t ask 15 year old kids much. You \u0152 you\u2122ve \u0152 if I had been 25, it would have been different, but I wasn\u2122t."

And the intelligence office had to issue security passes, as much as you could check anybody. We had a big headquarters that was in the middle of town.

I\u2122m sure that\u2122s true, by the way, and \u0152 because everything else was flat, except this wonderful building \u0152 it became our headquarters.

So, in the last six months I was over there, I became a special agent of the counter-intelligence corps, no insignia of rank, just two U.S.s, so that you could go to see some colonel, and chew him about what somebody in his outfit was doing, and without him knowing what your rank was, even though if you were 20 years old, they knew that you weren\u2122t a general. So, I sa \u0152 I \u0152 I did that. And it\u2122s actually as a result of that, that I \u0152 ultimately when I was in Syracuse University, I got a commission military intelligence, because the gentleman that \u0152 before I left, when my time wa \u0152 came to Interview with Ralph Hockley January 12, 2016 147 go home, I was interviewed by a colonel from intelligence headquarters in the States, asked me if I wouldn\u2122t stay as a warrant officer, or as an officer. And I said no, I \u0152 I \u0152 I\u2122d like to, but I \u0152 I \u0152 I want to go to college, I got to finish college, that\u2122s my first thing. But when I was at Syracuse in \u212248, I got a letter from the same colonel, he didn\u2122t know the c \u0152 the con \u0152 the connection, but he said, we\u2122re interested, if you would like to become a second lieutenant, military intelligence reserve, and he gave me the conditions. And you had to have been a staff sergeant, when I was a sergeant, which is one rank below the staff sergeant. So I wrote him back and I say, well, colonel, I appreciate, but I\u2122m only a sergeant, I\u2122m not a staff sergeant, so I don\u2122t qualify. But, if you are interested in knowing whether you think that I am qualified, if you\u2122re the same Colonel Stevens that came to Bremen , Germany and interviewed me in \u212246, and asked me to accept a commission, then you must know that I am qualified, otherwise you wouldn\u2122t have interviewed me. And he send me the same paper back, handwritten on there, I\u2122m the same guy, you\u2122ll hear from me. And about three or four weeks later, I got a handwritten note from him, and says, apply under army regulation so and so, so and so. I did, and within six months I was a second lieutenant, military intelligence reserve."

And I had that thrown at me at a couple of conferences I attended, or gave, and \u0152 and you know, I never make anybody feel bad in public, but I went to color \u0152 to Camp Carson , Colorado , and some si \u0152 command sergeant major just back from Iraq made this speech, and yes, there \u0152 there are the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the terrorists in Iraq is like the werewolves in Germany , and when it was over, I took him aside and said, look, Command Sergeant Major, there were no werewolves in Germany . I can tell you, I was there, and I was involved in this. And there was a co \u0152 marine colonel at a meeting in Houston , came up with the werewolves, the \u0152 the guys in Iraq being like the werewolves, and I said, it\u2122s just \u0152 let me stand up here and tell you, it\u2122s a damn lie. There were no werewolves in Germany . I have the only book that was ever written about the werewolves. There was one guy, who killed the mayor of Aachen, Germany , in \u0152 before the war was over, and he was called a werewolf. And after that, there were no werewolves. So it\u2122s a \u0152 it\u2122s a legend, that this existed. So, I\u2122m still alive to tell that the history is being misused."

Was there a time in this process where your feelings and your thoughts about Germany changed? Interview with Ralph Hockley January 12, 2016 156",
            "answer": "Well, my initial reaction \u0152 initial initial, in Bremen , was exemplified by the following; I walked down the street in Bremen one day, and there was a man beating his kid. And I was in American uniform. And I walked up to him and said, stop it. We\u2122re bringing democracy to you, in a democracy you don\u2122t beat your kid on the street. That was my immediate reaction. How do you get to the Germans? How do you get them away from this business of \u0152 of punishment, of \u0152 of beating, of harshness, and so on? So, all I could do at that moment was that. Gradually, the young generation, you \u0152 you know, there \u0152 you had to wait for a while. Germany was rebuilt amazingly fast, thanks to the Marshall Plan , and many other things. And the Germans are, undoubtedly, very astute, and \u0152 what\u2122s the word I\u2122m trying to think of \u0152 people. They \u0152 they work very hard, to this day. There are always exceptions, but generally speaking. They\u2122re well organized, they \u0152 they keep their nose to the grindstone, and \u0152 and they were lucky with the initial governments they got, you \u0152 you know, when you get a Konrad Adenauer , who was no pansy, who \u0152 who \u0152 who ran Germany pretty harshly, but that built everything up, and then he was followed by Erhard to fix the economy, and then of course, you had Willy Brandt , who was a socialist, and brought a lot of social things to Germany . They \u0152 they had some very good leaders. I can\u2122t think of one chancellor of Germany that was really bad. They had a couple of presidents, but presidents don\u2122t matter. They\u2122re \u0152 they were figureheads, like the queen of England . It\u2122s the chancellors who run the show. Interview with Ralph Hockley January 12, 2016 157 So, gradually the young generations there, they went through all kinds of stuff. The universities tended to be very liberal, to use a kind word. And so a lot of the students got pretty left-wingish. But gradually, this stuff was drummed into them, what it is like to be in democracy, and what \u0152 what happened is they \u0152 they \u0152 because there\u2122s been such a tremendous change in the way the world operates, that all they want \u0152 the young people want to do is go \u0152 come to America , or France , or \u0152 you know, they been \u0152 they were locked up in Germany , they couldn\u2122t get out of Germany , under Hitler. And so it \u0152 suddenly, there was some freedom of travel, and they saw that there were other societies, that weren\u2122t as bad as they were made out to be. And the people went to Brittany on vacation, instead of staying in Germany , saw that it was nice in Brittany , or wherever they went. Half of Germany \u2122s been to \u0152 to the Canary Islands , and to Spain , because \u0152 because they love the sun, primarily, but that\u2122s another \u0152 another world down there. So they \u0152 they \u0152 they passed a constitution, which is very democracy oriented, and they have a Supreme Court that is enforcing it. And it\u2122s not always to our liking, but it doesn\u2122t have to be. I \u0152 I always try to take people for who \u0152 the individual qualities, and what they were like, and their \u0152 I said, I met a lot of nice people. There are a lot of nice people in Germany . There are certain things that \u0152 at \u0152 at my farewell party, by the German \u0152 by the BND , the German CIA."

Or, let me put it this way, what would you tell such people, about the Germany you came to know?",

I did not live in Germany as an American living in Germany , I lived in Germany as a government representative of the United States . And so, all of my relations were based on that. If a policeman would stop me on the street, there\u2122s Interview with Ralph Hockley January 12, 2016 160 nothing he could do to me, because I had a semi-diplomatic passport. They have a status between the private passport, and the diplomatic passport, and it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s called a official passport? Do you remember what it\u2122s called? Official passport.

That\u2122s her maiden name. And so \u0152 but she never went back. I mean, having spent the entire war in Berlin , that was enough for anybody. So there \u0152 there are a few people, a handful of people who survived. I \u0152 she\u2122s the only one I\u2122ve ever known that \u0152 that did.

Because there\u2122s hardly anybody in Germany who is Bar Mitzvah any more. As a matter of fact, in the year that he was Bar Mitzvah, there were only two; him, and the son of the Israeli ambassador, and that was it. And so it was a big deal. And this lady was there.

You\u2122re going through this cycle right now where Mrs. Merkel is letting in a million refugees, which my analysis would tell me that it\u2122s a mistake. But she \u0152 she \u0152 it is bigger than what she predicted. She did it in the spirit of \u0152 of making up for Germany \u2122s name in the past. Of course, she was born in East Germany , and she didn\u2122t come to Germany until after the wall came down, and it became one Germany . She\u2122s probably very good at her job, but in this case, I would, as a former intelligence official, I would say that taking in a million Muslims, or foreigners \u0152 doesn\u2122t have to be Muslims \u0152 at one time, is something which a democracy can\u2122t handle. It\u2122s just sheer numbers.

You \u0152 I read their manifesto, I didn\u2122t understand a word of it. I mean, they were so way out, you know, it didn\u2122t make any sense. They killed people.
