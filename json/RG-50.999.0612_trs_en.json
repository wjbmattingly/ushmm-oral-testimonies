My name is Bill Benson. | am the host of the museum's public program, First Person.\nThank you for joining us today. We are in our 18th year of First Person. Our First Person today\nis Mrs. Julie Keefer, whom you shall meet shortly.\n\nThis 2017 season of First Person is made possible by the generosity of the Louis\nFranklin Smith Foundation, with additional funding from the Arlene and Daniel Fisher\nFoundation. We are grateful for their sponsorship.\n\nI'm pleased to let you know that Mr. Louis Smith is in the front row with us today.\n>> [Applause]\n>> Bill Benson: First Person is a series of conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who\nshare with us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each of our\nFirst Person guests serves as a volunteer here at this museum. Our program will continue\ntwice-weekly until mid-August. The museum's website, at www.ushmm.org, provides\ninformation about each of our upcoming First Person guests.\n\nJulie will share with us her \"First Person\" account of her experience during the\nHolocaust and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. If time allows, we will have an opportunity\nfor you to ask Julie questions. The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades.\nWhat you are about to hear from Julie is one individual's account of the Holocaust. We have\nprepared a brief slide presentation to help with her introduction.\n\nJulie Keefer was born Jula Weinstock to Jewish parents in Lwow, Poland, on\nApril 19, 1941. This photograph of Julie is the only one that exists from her time in hiding.\n\nOn this map of Poland the arrow points to Lwow, where Julie was born.\n\nIn this photograph, Julie's father, Herman, is the man farthest to the left in the back\nrow and her mother, Sala, is the woman farthest to the left in the front row. Julie's parents also\nwould have a younger daughter named Tola.\n\nIn June 1941, Germans occupied Lwow. German and Ukrainian authorities forced all\nJews into a ghetto, including Julie and her family. On this map of Lwow, the white arrow points\nto the location of the ghetto.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n2\n\nJulie's grandfather, Aizik, was arrested and made a forced laborer. After working at a\nlime quarry, they moved him to Janowska labor camp, indicated here with the red arrow. He\nescaped from this labor camp. Learning that the Lwow ghetto would be destroyed, he helped\nJulie and her parents and her sister hide in a bunker in a nearby forest with 30 other Jews from\nLwow. He then moved Julie and her sister to live with his non-Jewish friend, Lucia, because he\nfeared the girls' crying would give their hiding spot away. In March 1942, the Germans\ndeported thousands of Jews who had remained in the Lwow ghetto to the Belzec killing center.\nThey boarded trains from the Kleptarow train station indicated here with the blue arrow.\n\nThis photograph shows Lucia Nowicki on the left and Aizik on the right. Aizik\nassumed the identity of Lucia's husband, and they introduced Julie and her sister as her\nnieces. Aizik traveled back and forth between Lucia's house and the forest to help the people\nin hiding there. At one point Lucia was arrested by Security Police. With Lucia in prison, Aizik\nhid Julie's sister in a Catholic children children's home. When Lucia was released from prison,\nshe returned home and cared for Julie.\n\nOne day while Aizik was visiting Lucia in town, the Germans found the bunker in the\nforest and killed everyone hidden there, including Julie's parents. At the end of the war, as\nSoviet troops approached, the Germans evacuated the Catholic children's home where Julie's\nsister lived. Aizik and Julie were unable to find Julie's sister after the war.\n\nThis photograph shows Julie, the older girl on the left, Aizik, Lucia, and Julie's friend\nin a Displaced Persons camp after the war.\n\nAizik sent Julie to America in 1948, hoping to join her later. Julie lived in a children's\nhome for six years until a couple from Cleveland, Ohio, adopted her. Aizik married Lucia and\nthey eventually immigrated to the United States and settled in New York.\n\nFollowing Julie's adoption by Thea and Fred Klestadt at age 16 in 1957 and her\ngraduation from high school, Julie attended Oberlin College in Ohio where she majored in\nFrench with minors in Spanish and art. While at Oberlin Julie met Larry Keefer wnom she\nmarried on June 24, 1962, 55 years ago. Julie furthered her education with a Master's degree\nin special education to work with emotionally disturbed adolescents and did Ph.D-level study in\nhuman growth and development. She studied psychology at the University of Nebraska. After\nJulie and Larry moved to the Washington, DC area, she continued her studies at Bowie State\nUniversity and several other academic institutions.\n\nJulie spent 29 years with the Montgomery County Maryland Public School System\nretiring in 2001. Over the course of those three decades she held a number of key positions\nincluding Mainstream Coordinator working with special needs students and teachers at several\nhigh schools, and participated in teacher training programs, some in conjunction with American\nUniversity. All of them dealt with education equity. Among her many accomplishments she\ncreated LUPE, an anti-gang program to improve academic performance among Hispanic\nstudents at an area high school. A memorable occasion was a visit by President Clinton and\nBritish Prime Minister Tony Blair to a high school where she was the Administrator-in-Charge.\n\nJulie's husband is a Ph.D. chemist who worked first at the Chicago Medical School\nand the University of Nebraska Medical School before joining the scientific staff at the National\nInstitutes of Health/National Cancer Institute here in the Washington, DC area in 1971. Much\nof Larry's career has been devoted to cancer research and cancer-related drug development.\nLarry retired on October ist, 2015, after 44 years with the NIH/NCI. Larry is here with Julie\ntoday.\n\nJulie and Larry have two children, Steve and Simona, and three grandsons. Their\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n3\nson Steve, a former Army Ranger, received a dual degree in economics and Japanese from\nthe Wharton School of Business and the University of Pennsylvania. He now owns two\nbusinesses. Steve's oldest son has just returned from Israel and will be in charge of the\nsummer tennis program for the Anne Arundel County Recreation Department; his younger son\nhas just completed his second year at Earlham College in Indiana. Daughter Simona is a fine\nartist and after a career in photography, painting and glasswork now is a businesswoman. Her\nson has just completed his sophomore year at Springbrook High School in Maryland. As Julie\nnoted to me with pride, \"We got really lucky on kids and grandkids.\"\n\nJulie has worked as a volunteer at the Membership Desk of this museum on\nThursdays and later on Mondays where she has shared her story with visitors. Most recently,\nshe has been out on sick leave but hopes to return in July. | think today represents a step\nforward to doing that.\n\nIn addition to Larry, Julie is accompanied today by her daughter Simona.\n\nWith that | would like you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Julie Keefer.\n>> [Applause]\n>> Bill Benson: Julie, thank you so much for joining us today and being willing to be our First\nPerson, particularly knowing that you've been ill of late. So we are really glad to have you\nback. | know you're a little worried about your voice not being strong, but | think with the\nmicrophones it will work out just fine.\n>> Julie Keefer: Please forgive me if | change octaves. My voice is not under my control. And |\napologize. If you cannot hear me, please make sure to raise a hand. Ok? And | have to thank\nall of you so much for taking your time and coming here today.\n>> Bill Benson: Julie, you have so much to share with us in a short period so we'll just jump\nright in if that's ok.\n\nWorld War II began with the invasion of Poland by first Germany then Russia in\nSeptember 1939. You were born in April 1941. When you were born, the city where your family\nlived was under Soviet occupation. | know you know very little about your family and their lives\nprior to your birth but to the extent that you can, share with us what you do know about your\nfamily prior to your birth.\n>> Julie Keefer: First | have to say that what | Know are things that my grandfather wrote in his\ndiary. Some things | remember but | remember them with the eyes of a child. And some things\n| was told.\n\nWhat | Knew about my family beforehand was that my grandfather was an import\nfood and vegetable dealer, middle class. My mother was a Jewish opera singer. My father --\nand here is where the translation is interesting -- was either a tinsmith or a plumber. It depends\nwhether you read the Polish or the Russian records. So he was one of the above. My parents\nwere living ok until the Russians came and times became very hard.\n>> Bill Benson: Do you know anything about your extended family?\n>> Julie Keefer: | Know that my grandfather's brothers one way or another died. His wife was\nkilled at Belzac. His parents, extended family, most of them were killed at Belzac.\n\nMy uncle, you saw his picture. | do not know his name, my mother's older brother,\nwas in the Polish Army and | guess he was killed there. He was the gentleman on the right, in\nthe uniform. And below him was his wife.\n>> Bill Benson: A couple more questions about that time. You had some family at that time in\nthe United States.\n>> Julie Keefer: Mm-hmm.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n4\n>> Bill Benson: How did they get to be here?\n>> Julie Keefer: My grandfather's parents sent the two daughters they had to America because\nat that time there were pogroms, where Jews were rounded up and often women or killed or\nraped or both. So to prevent that, my grandfather's father sent his two daughters to America\nand they settled in Brooklyn.\n\n| also had a great aunt. | don't know how or why she came to America but |\nremember that she and her twin brother came to America. And my great Aunt Helen, who |\nadored, was about yay high, with great, big, huge blue eyes and this magnificent face. She had\nher twin brother who was a farmer and, of course, had five daughters and was so disappointed\nno sons to help him on his farm.\n\nWhat | remember about Uncle Charlie was that he drove through the mountains like\na fiend. He was just, \"Uhhh.\" He had the biggest hands | had ever seen, huge, huge hands.\nWhen | saw \u201cThe Potato Eaters\u201d by Van Gogh, | continued to remember my Uncle Charlie.\n\nAnyway, my two grandfather's sisters -- they lived together in a house they shared.\nThe older one was a widow and her daughter lived in the house also. And the younger one\nwas married and had a daughter who was four years older than I. And Tanta Rosa, the oldest,\nhad a daughter that was eight years older than I.\n\nlt was very hard for my aunt. | think my grandfather guilt tripped her and said, oh,\nyou know, you will take my granddaughter. And | don't think she was looking forward to that.\nAnd | can't blame her. Here | was this little heathen who grew up in a war, hadn't really seen\nplumbing before. My English consisted of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10,\nperiod. And if anybody said anything else. And the only school | had gone to was a school in\nHebrew. And suddenly she was stuck with me.\n\nShe had her own issues. When she first -- she adored her older brother, my\ngrandfather. And he was like her hero. When she first saw me, at a Catholic orphanage in New\nYork when we had just landed in Boston and then by bus we went to New York, | remember\nher standing at the bottom of the stairs and speaking to one of the nuns in German. She could\nhave spoken English and | would have understood nothing she said but, in fact, she said,\nwhen she saw me, \"Oh, that can't be Aizik's granddaughter. He's so -- and she's so.\" And that\nstarted off our relationship.\n>> Bill Benson: And Julie, | hope we'll get to later how difficult the adjustment was after you\narrived here. There were tough times for you in getting here. But going back, you were born in\nApril of 1941 and Nazi Germany turned in June 41. Within days the city of Lwow, where you\nlived, was occupied by the Nazis. Your family was quickly forced into a ghetto. What did that\nmean for your family, for all of you including your grandfather, Aizik?\n>> Julie Keefer: My grandfather and my father got together and planned a hiding place, which\nwas often called a bunker, a special secret compartment in his barn. And my mother, very\npregnant, and | and my father, grandfather and others, were hiding in that secret bunker until\nmy grandfather left to go visit a friend who didn't have any hiding place and then he was picked\nup. And he was sent to his first labor camp, which was Jaktorow, and that's where he worked\nin the limestone quarry, which was eight kilometers from the camp itself. He would work in the\nquarry, taking rocks and he had to bring them back to the camp, enduring beatings all the time.\n\n| visited that place when | went four years ago. It is now appropriately an insane\nasylum. The building where the commandant lived is the kind of headquarters of it. | was told\nby a woman we met there -- she said, you know, | was not born yet but | was told that the\nground -- this place looked very pastoral, absolutely gorgeous with greenery and mountains\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n\n5\nand hills and valleys, just beautiful looking. And on one of these hills is a monument. It is from\nthe Israeli government. It says basically that 20,000 Jews were murdered there. And it's\ninteresting because this woman said that her family members said \"| remember the ground\nmoving for three days.\" What had happened was a huge trench was dug, usually by prisoners\nthemselves, and people were shot and buried but some were buried alive, so kind of moved,\nthe ground moved.\n\nlf you read Father Desbois' book, \"The Holocaust by Bullets\" he described some of\nthat also, in the Ukraine, when he and his colleagues went there to identify Jews who had no\nknown graves and who were just buried here or there, to find what their names were. Father\nDesbois studied, worked with, Mother Teresa. And he remembered so well Mother Teresa\nsaying everyone deserves a name. So he, too, was bound and determined to go and find the\nnames of those who were not killed in gas chambers or in other ways but who were killed by\nbullets and buried in unmarked graves.\n>> Bill Benson: Julie, your grandfather, as you were describing to us, of course, he was\narrested and sent to the first camp and then he would be sent to a second camp, Janowska.\nTell us a little bit about what happened to him there.\n>> Julie Keefer: Janowska was later Known -- began as a labor camp and turned into a killing\ncamp. It was a huge camp. | have some pictures of pieces of it now. When he got captured,\nfirst thing that happened was that he was taken to Kleptarow station and people were\nseparated into two groups. Abled-bodied men were put on one side, women weak looking or\nanyone who had any handicap or children were put into another side.\n\nThis gets a little graphic. So if there are young children here, please make sure you\ntalk to them later and process things with them.\n\nBabies were taken by the foot, by their feet, children under 2, and they were thrown\nagainst these huge pillars and their skulls were crushed. They were thrown into the trains with\nthe mothers and everyone else who didn't make the count and sent to Belzac, which was a gas\ncamp. And in Belzac -- well, Belzac doesn't exist any longer but at the train station there is a\nsign saying from this station, Kleptarow, 500,000 Jews were killed, were taken and killed at\nBelzac camp. And, of course, this was what we had to look forward to. And this is what my\ngrandfather saw. He was taken because he was very strong.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the first time | read about Jean Valjean, | kept thinking about my\ngrandfather because Jean Valjean was basically found because he was so strong that he\ncould lift a cart, which he did to save someone's life. And my grandfather could lift a car.\n\nSo he was my everything. He was taken because he could be a good worker. He\nlost 100 pounds. One of his friends -- he watched one of his friends expire in agony because\nhe was hung by his feet until he died.\n>> Bill Benson: Your grandfather was whipped viciously in one particular case.\n>> Julie Keefer: Yeah, he was. He had said to the commandant that, you know, these beds\nso-called, wooden slats, would hold eight people at most but not 16. And the commandant was\nso irritated that a Jew dared to talk this way to him that he had my grandfather receive 100\nlashes. And the rule was if you refused to give the 100 lashes to whoever, and it was usually a\nJew who was forced to do this, you got 200 and the Jew got killed immediately.\n\nWell, my grandfather was black and blue and that night he was, of course, in agony,\nbut his fellow prisoners had gotten cold, wet material and put it on his back and his body. So\nthe next morning when he got up for what is called [Speaking Non-English Language], which\nmeans the head count, the commandant came by and said, \"Oh, you dog. You're alive. |\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n6\nexpected you to die. Die, Jew dog, die.\" And this commandant had a habit of shooting people\nin the head. He didn't like where your Jewish star was sewed on your jacket or pants, he would\nshoot | in the head.\n\nSo the reason it was called a killing camp is 200,000 Jews were killed from that\ncamp, Janowska.\n>> Bill Benson: And your grandfather, despite what he went through, ended up escaping from\nthere. Tell us about his escape.\n>> Julie Keefer: He was told the next day -- because he had lost 100 pounds and, of course, a\nlot of his strength. He was told he would be taken to the back and shot the next day. So he\ndecided to escape.\n\nThere is a song by Janice Joplin, \u201cFreedom's just another name for nothing left to\nlose.\u201d He had nothing left to lose. So where the centuries brought in new prisoners, there were\nhuge gates. And the gates were opened for new prisoners and he ran out and down a hill. We\nsaw where that probably was. Crossed the street and there was this huge like hole or whatever\nand at the bottom of it a train ran. He was going there. And as he jumped, he was shot in the\nright hand but he managed to get to the other side just as a train -- a munitions train was\ncoming. So he ran with the train and his life was saved.\n\nBut, he had a bleeding hand, he had a thin cotton uniform, the concentration camp\nuniform, and no shoes because his feet were so big and, of course, all the clothes of all the\nprisoners were taken and they were given like wooden shoes and nothing would fit him so he\nwas barefoot. And this was in late November. And in Poland it was snowing and terribly cold.\nSo he was running. He wound up in a small woods and wondering how can God do this to the\ninnocent Jewish people.\n\nThen he was desperate and ran to the home of a Polish peasant, Mr. Bereczki. And\nI'm still trying to go and get him as one of the righteous amongst nations. This is a man, again,\npoor man who, of course, knew that my grandfather was a Jew, from a concentration camp,\nbecause he saw the uniform. Even though my grandfather had ripped off the Jewish star. He\nbandaged -- well, he put mercurochrome in my grandfather's hand, bandaged it, gave him\nwarm clothing and some food and said, \"Look, go sleep in my barn.\" My grandfather said, \"No.\n| can't do that.\" Because in Poland if you were a non-Jew who helped a Jew, your family was\nhung in front of your eyes and they were left on lamp-posts, then you were shot and then the\nJew was killed. So my grandfather was very unwilling to do this. And the man said, \"Look, I'll\nleave the barn door open and if the Nazis come, I'll say who knows who goes in my barn? The\ndoor was open.\"\n\nSo that's where he spent the night. The following day, Mr. Bereczki gave him a\nshovel, some food and three breads and salt and took him -- oh, they wrapped his feet in rags\nbecause, of course, nobody had shoes to fit him. Mr. Bereczki took him to the forest which was\nabout six kilometers away and told him to hide himself there. And the shovel was to dig a ditch\nfor himself so that he could hide from the elements but also from the Nazis because it was a\nvery vast woods. So my grandfather did that.\n\nMeanwhile, my father, my mother, and my baby sister was born while they were in\nhiding.\n>> Bill Benson: In the ghetto.\n>> Julie Keefer: In that bunker in the ghetto. And | often think how could my mother do it. How\ncould she give birth to a live child and stay alive herself in a situation where there was no\nmedicine, no food, there were dead bodies all over the place? How could she cope? But\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n7\napparently she did because my baby sister was born.\n\nThen my grandfather was hiding in the woods. One day he heard some men.\n>> Bill Benson: In the meantime, you're still all hidden.\n>> Julie Keefer: We're all still hidden. That's right. Thank you. Right.\n\nMy grandfather is in this small tunnel. Other Jews come. And one of them has a gun.\nSo my grandfather had been a soldier in World War |, so he became head. The tunnel got\nmore and more expanded by more and more people coming from small towns near Lwow, all\naround, until there was 30-some Jews hiding in this tunnel.\n>> Bill Benson: Which he had been enlarging.\n>> Julie Keefer: All the men were. And the men would go out at night and shoot the tires of\nNazi munitions trucks and grab guns and ammo and grenades. They would also go to the\nUkrainian collaborator huts and grab cheese, canned goods, whatever they could, and water,\nand whatever they could grab to bring back to the people in the tunnel.\n\nOne day as my grandfather went to Mr. Bereczki's house again, he found out that\nthe Nazis were going to burn the ghetto. Of course, we were still hiding there. So he took a\nNazi command car, a Nazi uniform --\n>> Bill Benson: That they had stolen.\n>> Julie Keefer: That they had stolen. Thank you. Right, Bill. And decided to go to the ghetto to\nget us out. And he went at night. He asked the other men to stay in the forest a little bit far\naway and he would go to the ghetto himself. Because he knew exactly where we were.\n\nSo he went in. He took me and my father took my baby sister and my mother and we all got\nsomehow to the command car. We were supposed to go to Mr. Bereczki's, my grandfather and\nhe had talked about how they were going to hide my mother, my baby sister, Tola, and me. |\nwas almost 3. My baby sister was 5 months.\n\nWhat | remember about that time is a couple of things. | remember that tunnel. |\nremember it so clearly. And sometime if we have time I'll describe it you. But | don't remember\nany people in it. | remember my grandfather, that's all.\n>> Bill Benson: And yet 30-plus people were there.\n>> Julie Keefer: Were there. Uh-huh. The men were going out often to get supplies and to do\nwhatever they could.\n>> Bill Benson: You ended up not staying with Mr. Bereczki though. And why was that?\n>> Julie Keefer: Because my mother said, look, I've lost my mother, I've lost so much, I'm not\ngoing to lose my husband and you, father, I'm not going to be separated. If | die, | want to die\nwith my family. What's left of it. So she got her way. My baby sister and | were taken to the\ntunnel.\n\nNow, the tunnel, we all got lice. It was cold and damp and full of all kinds of insects.\nWe couldn't really bathe. It was too cold to bathe in cold water. And the other thing was -- well,\nwe tried to wash but we had to use the water we got for drinking. We could not cook or make\nfires because the Nazis would see the smoke. So it was a tough place to be.\n>> Bill Benson: Especially for little kids.\n>> Julie Keefer: Especially for little kids. Now, | have to describe it to you, if you don't mind. Is\nthat ok? Ok.\n\nThis is a way -- remember, | was almost 3 at this point. So the memory | have is of a\nvery tall ladder, a wooden ladder going down, which probably was no more than six feet. And |\nremember these walls that were wet clay or mud. They were damp. | remember feeling my\nway. There was one kind of long room. And everything, | remember that clay, that cold, damp\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n8\nclay. And at the end of that room was a round, wooden, splintery table and on it squatted a fat\ncandle. And that was the source of light. And | remember touching my way around and feeling\nall of that. And then there was like an arch way to the side. And in that archway was another\nroom much smaller than this one. But what | remember about it was it was dark and |\nremember touching touching or trying to touch something. And it was the first time my\ngrandfather raised his voice to me. He raised his hand. \"Don't touch!\" He was about to smack\nmy hand.\n\nNow, my grandfather was my darling and | was his and he never raised his voice\nmuch less his hand to me. So | was shocked. And can you guess why he raised his voice?\nAnybody?\n>> [Inaudible]\n>> Bill Benson: Knock over the candle?\n>> Julie Keefer: That's a good point. But the candle was still in the other room. This was in a\nseparate room on the side.\n>> Bill Benson: Weapons?\n>> Julie Keefer: Exactly. It was guns and ammunition and grenades. And if | had touched that,\nsomething might have gone off. So that's why.\n>> Bill Benson: | Know you have so much more to share with us and our time is getting a little\nbit on the short side. You did not stay in the bunker terribly long before your grandfather had to\nmake the decision for you not to stay there. Tell us about the events from there for you.\n>> Julie Keefer: Because we cried -- | could be stopped but how do you stop a 6-month-old, a\n5-month-old baby? So one day my mother put her hand over Tola's mouth and almost\nsuffocated her. My grandfather said, \u201cSala, stop, you'll smother the baby.\u201d So he decided he\nwould get us out of there because we were endangering not only our family but everybody\nelse. And grandpa was the leader and he couldn't endanger the lives of 30-some people for his\ngrandchildren.\n\nSo he dressed as a Polish peasant, with Mr. Bereczki's help. He had one of these\njackets that he pulled up the collar very high. He borrowed a cart from Mr. Bereczki. It was not\nuncommon to go to the central market of Lwow. He did that. And in the central market he was\nlooking for a doctor who ran a Catholic orphanage and could not find him. He describes how\ndesperate he was. He couldn't find him. And he didn't know what to do. So what he did was he\nwas thinking of just leaving us because we were little and cute and he thought, well, someone\nwould take us and save our lives. And if he lived through the war, he would come and get us\nafter the war was over.\n\nJust at that point he ran into a woman who had been a neighbor of his, a Polish\nCatholic woman. Her name is on the wall of the righteous amongst nations, Lucia Nowicka.\nShe is the one who saved our lives. She became my pretend aunt. Told us pretend aunt.\nSupposedly Tola and | were her sister's children and her sister was from the small town nearby\nand her sister had been killed. There was a lot of fighting at that point between Pols and\nUkrainians. And they were Polish and they were supposedly killed by Ukrainians.\n\nSo he said, \u201cLucia, can you take the babies and save their lives?\u201d And she said, \u201cBut\nAizik, | no longer have my own home. | live as a live-in housekeeper for a retired engineer and\nhis wife in the country. So I'd have to ask Mrs. Swierczynski if | could take the children.\u201d So she\ndid, and could she bring her nieces, her sister died and she had to take care of them. And\nMrs. Swierczynski said sure, why not. So we came there as her nieces.\n\nMy grandfather, as Bill mentioned to you, took her husband's, dead husband's,\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n9\npapers and became instead of Aizik Eisen he became Stanislaus Nowicka, 6'2\", Hazel-colored\neyes, about 220 or so pounds, so he could pass.\n\nAt that point -- Lucia lived as this housekeeper who took care of the cooking, the\ncleaning, the skinny horse, the skinnier cow. And she was there and my grandfather was in the\narea working at various farms, trying to get a potato here, a chicken there, anything to bring\nback and help.\n>> Bill Benson: Had he gone back to the bunker yet?\n>> Julie Keefer: Not yet. He had not gone back to the bunker yet.\n\nThen someone on the street, a woman down the street, said that Lucia Nowicka,\nhousekeeper for the Swierczynskis, was hiding Jewish children. Now, the Gestapo came to\nquestion her and took her for questioning, which meant she was imprisoned and tortured.\nWhen my grandfather came back to the house, he couldn't find Lucia. Mrs. Swierczynski was\nkind of beside herself. So he said, \u201cWhat's going on?\u201d Well, Mrs. Swierczynski said that the\nGestapo took her housekeeper and she doesn't know why. So grandpa said, you know,\n\nMrs. Swierczynski, you're a friend of the wife of the Nazi governor of Lwow. Now, the Nazi\ngovernor of Lwow lived in the house next to the Swierczynskis. So there were soldiers all\naround. So my grandfather said, Well, can you talk to the governor's wife and find out what's\ngoing on and get Lucia back?\n\nWhile she was gone -- by the way, Mrs. Swierczynski could not cope with a little tiny\nbaby. She was old. And she had a house to take care of and all of this cooking to do and these\nanimals. So she went to the governor's wife and said, look, they took Lucia and | don't know\nwhy and | really don't know what to do without her because | can't do all of this.\n\nMeanwhile, before this happened, my grandfather decided to save Tola's life by\ntaking her, at 6 months old, to a Catholic orphanage run by a professor of pediatrics at the\nuniversity and also a pediatrician who ran this children's home. He changed her name from\nTola Weinstock, Jewish child, to Antonina Nowicka, Catholic child, 6 months old, blondish hair,\nblue eyes, and paid three months in advance and thought, well, at least one of us will Survive\nthe war.\n\nHe came back. And then he talked with Mrs. Swierczynski about approaching the\ngovernor's wife to get Lucia back because he was terrified that the Gestapo was going to kill\nher or torture her so badly that she would tell that we were all Jewish and that the people in the\nwoods were Jewish as well. Well, the commandant heard. He took his car, whatever, and went\nto Gestapo quarters and told the Gestapo to get Lucia and bring her right down. So Lucia was\ntold by the Gestapo to clean up and to not talk about her experiences ever to anyone. And she\ncame back to the Swierczynski's home to resume her duties. As | say, she had been tortured.\nSo she was a little bit high strung after this and had a hard time.\n>> Bill Benson: But she had stuck to the story that you were her nieces?\n>> Julie Keefer: She absolutely, and didn't tell anything about anything. And my grandfather\nfelt, well, ok, one child was safe at the children's home, | was safe where | was, now he had to\ngo to the woods and check on how everybody was doing in the woods.\n\nIt was now April, right around my birthday. It was 1944. He went to the woods. And\nat first he thought something's funny. This tunnel has been disturbed. Then he found the\nbodies. He thought maybe it was our own grenades or whatever. Then he and one other man\nwho had gone to work with the resistance found that all the bodies had bullet holes. So he and\nthis other man said a prayer for the dead and buried all 30-some people in that same tunnel in\nthe Borszczowice woods. And there my parents lie in an unmarked grave somewhere in the\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n10\nBorszczowice Forest.\n\nWhen we went back, my husband and I, in 2013, we were going through the\nBorszczowice Forest and trying to find these huge depressions. We found lots of depressions\nbut --\n>> Bill Benson: No way to know.\n>> Julie Keefer: No way to know. Right, no way to know.\n>> Bill Benson: So your grandfather's there. He's just buried his daughter and son-in-law and\nyour parents and many others, and now he makes his way back to Lucia and the\nSwierczynskis. What happened then?\n>> Julie Keefer: Then he was now living there with Lucia.\n>> Bill Benson: As her husband.\n>> Julie Keefer: As her husband. And pretty soon, two months later, the Russians came and\nliberated us and the war was over for us. Then, we started kind of -- well, he kept -- he started\nlooking for my sister. The children's home, the roof had been bombed, and she had been\nmoved to a different town in Poland. He went there and looked for her. Nothing. So at that\npoint he decided to try other places. He heard that the children, 80 of them, were broken into\ntwo groups, 40 went to Western Europe somewhere and 40 were taken to Hungary. Now, at\nthat time you could not get into Hungary at all. It was tight with the Russians so couldn't get in\nthere at all. He went everywhere, to Germany to France, to Austria, to you name it, could not\nfind any trace of these 40 children. And we've been looking ever since.\n\nOh, then we were living in a DP camp, our third one now.\n>> Bill Benson: A displaced persons camp.\n>> Julie Keefer: Or delayed pilgrims.\n>> [Laughter]\n>> Julie Keefer: So we were, indeed, delayed. Ok? So there we were, in our third one which\nwas the [Indiscernible] camp, very close to Austria. This camp was the largest of the three in\nAustria and the most primitive. It was meant to be very temporary. So people lived in shacks\nand old-fashioned Army barracks which were broken into rooms. Each family got one room.\nThere was no indoor plumbing. There was no heat. There was no, of course, electricity. There\nwas no water. You had to get your water from an outside spigot and the privies were all ina\nrow on one side of the camp. It was not a great place to be.\n\nMy grandfather wanted us to go to Israel but -- at that time it was Palestine. But\nPalestine was not taking any more old people and orphaned children because it was in a state\nof war itself. So he tried for America but you could not get visas to America at all, except if you\nwere an orphan and you were born between certain years, you could come to America. Well, |\nqualified. | was 7 years old. Grandpa sent me to America so | could have a better life. | could\nhave food and safety and shelter and disease free.\n>> Bill Benson: So you traveled here by yourself without any family members.\n>> Julie Keefer: | traveled with a group of orphan girls. | was the youngest by five years.\nGrandpa talked to a 13-year-old girl and asked her to be in charge of me; that | was little and\nhe was going to be so sad. | was all he had left. Would she look after me?\n>> Bill Benson: Do you remember anything about how you felt at that time?\n>> Julie Keefer: Yes. | remember that very clearly. Before we came to America we had to have\nall kinds of shots and immunizations, and so we were in a series of different orphanages. The\nfirst one, | remember one day walking with my grandfather. At this point he had married the\nwoman who saved our lives and she became my grandmother. And we were all walking. It was\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n11\nbeautiful, beautiful spring day. And | remember flowers all around. | remember we were\nwalking in a field. We saw what looked like kind of wire, like a cage. And there were children\nthere. They were sticking their noses in the wire things. | remember feeling just awful because\nthey all looked so sad. So | remember taking Dziadzia's hand and saying, \u201cYou won't put me\nthere, will you?\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, | won't.\u201d | said, \u201cPromise.\u201d He said, \u201cOk, | promise.\u201d A week\nlater we were at the entrance of this home and | was put into it.\n\nAnd | felt totally betrayed. | felt terribly lonely and not wanted. | remember | told you\nthat grandma's mind was affected when she was tortured and she couldn't cope with the fact\nthat she was losing me. So | remember her bending down and saying to me, whispering, \"See\nhow terrible you are? Even your dziadzia does not like you.\" And so | was sad. We went from\none orphanage to another. | stopped eating. | was just kind of wasting away, | guess, because\none of the nuns said to another one, \"We better call the grandfather. She's not going to live.\"\nSo they called. He and babciu came. And dziadzia gave me my first real toy, a China doll with\neyes that opened and closed. And he gave a dozen oranges to the nuns and sum to this girl\nwho he wanted to watch me.\n\nNow, oranges were priceless at that time. Nobody had oranges. He kissed me. |\nremember | got on the ship. The ship was an old Naval vessel converted to take 800-plus\npassengers to Boston, America. | thought -- | was very lonely. We girls slept on what they\ncalled hammocks. And there were four of them. And | slept on the bottom one because | was\nobviously the shortest. But what | remember is something moving all the time. Terribly seasick.\n| remember a terrible, terrible tooth ache. Because in DP camp anything American was\nwonderful. So what did we get? Coca-Cola. What did we live on? Coca-Cola. Well, it did a\nnumber on my teeth, | guess. So | had this massive, massive tooth ache. My friend talked to\none of the nuns and the nuns put oil of cloves on it. To this day when | smell oil of cloves, |\nremember that feeling on that ship. But it took eight agonizing days to go from Bremen to at\nthat point Boston.\n\nJust as an aside, in fourth grade, in America, we were studying geography and our\nteacher was pointing out this is the distance between this and this. Well, the distance between\nBremen and Boston was this big. Ok? And it took eight days. So | decided geography lied.\n>> Bill Benson: We're at the end of our time. You have to close our program. Obviously we\ncould spend a great deal more time with Julie just hearing about her transition, ending up in\nCleveland in an orphanage for a number of years before being adopted when you were 16, |\nbelieve.\n>> Julie Keefer: | was 16.\n>> Bill Benson: And then later, of course, your grandfather and Lucia would come to the United\nStates. | wish we had time to hear that.\n\nThe one last thing | would like you to share with us is you lost your parents so\nyoung, in a terrible way. You do not remember them but you told me that there is a song that\nfor you evokes the memory of your mom.\n>> Julie Keefer: As | mentioned to you, my mother was a Jewish opera singer. She had a\ngorgeous voice. What | remember about my mother, yes, that song [Indiscernible], if I'm saying\nit correctly. It's a Yiddish lullaby and very, very beautiful. And | remember that she was soft and\ncuddly and she smelled milky. That's all | remember about her. And | guess she must have\nsmelled milky because she was nursing my baby sister. And she was soft and cuddly and had\nthis gorgeous voice, in contrast to Lucia.\n\nLucia | have to describe as a woman who could swear in 30 different languages.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n\n12\n>> Bill Benson: Could not sing lullabies?\n>> Julie Keefer: | asked her to sing a lullaby once and | got this croaking sound of a bar song. |\nsaid, well, never mind.\n>> [Laughter]\n>> Julie Keefer: And that's when | noticed that there was a difference. Then she was also very,\nvery thin and bony and my mother was nice and soft. One day she had me in her arms and\nwas taking me on a bus, saying she was my mother. And | said, \"You're not my mother!\"\n>> Bill Benson: Julie's going to close our program in just a couple of moments. It's our tradition\nat First Person that our First Person has the last word, so Julie will close the program. Before\nshe does -- first, we didn't have a chance for you to ask questions of Julie but when we're done\nwhen Julie finishes in a moment, she will remain on the stage. So, please, absolutely feel free\nto come up on stage afterwards. Just say hi to her, give her a hug, get your photo taken or ask\nher the questions you want to ask her. We urge you to do that if you want to do that. We'll just\nhave you come up on stage if you don't mind.\n\n| thank you for being here. We have First Person programs each Wednesday and\nThursday until the middle of August. We hope you can come back sometime. If not, in future\nyears. Just look on the museum's website. You will see the schedule for us. We run between\nMarch and August of each year.\n>> Bill Benson: It's our tradition that our First Person has the last word. So, Julie?\n>> Julie Keefer: Well, | feel very, very fortunate. | have been so lucky in my life. | have had\nhelp when | thought | would never have help, nor did | want it at times. But | was so fortunate\nto meet people and have them in my life who made life worthwhile and living.\n\nMy work in the Holocaust Museum is so great because | get to meet all of these\nwonderful young people who are so super. They're smart. They care. They're dedicated to\nhumanity and helping others. | think, wow, are we ever fortunate to have such wonderful,\nfabulous young people. And | look at my three grandsons and they fit the bill, too. So | feel\nextremely fortunate that | get to have contact with these wonderful young people, including\n[Indiscernible] here. We worked on a project together and he's fabulous.\n\nThank you all very, very much.\n>> [Applause]\n\n",
