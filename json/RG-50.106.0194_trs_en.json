The interview is conducted by Hannah Starman. Thank you very much\nfirst of all for granting us this opportunity to hear your experience and I understood you wanted\nto make a statement.\nMatilde Neuwirt: Yes and I want to thank you and tell you that you are very welcome to give me\nthis opportunity. So I will, I want to say this. I want to express my sincere thanks to MrGiovanni\nChiampesan for his efforts, considerable efforts in locating me. And reviving memories that are\nvery precious and the beautiful part of my growing up years in Italy at the very incredibly tragic\ntime for most Jews. Also many, many thanks to Ms. Hannah Starman who is making it possible\nfor me to speak and retell the events belonging to my childhood, childhood years in Italy. 1940\nthrough 1949. During and after the war, as well as starting a new life in the USA. Now that I\nknow from Mr. Giovanni Chiampesan that it was his father Leno who made it possible for the\nJews in Sandrigo to escape before the Nazis came in. By supplying us with documents stating\nthat we were Christians born in Italy, my eternal gratitude goes to Mr. Lino Chiampesan for\nsaving our lives at great peril to himself. In recalling the events in chronological order, I will\nmention other people who opened their homes and hearts and decided to help this relatively\nsmall group to escape the evil Nazi intentions. In particular the Daria family, two brothers and a\nsister and they all took part in this effort.\nHannah Starman: So this is the interview with Matilde Neuwirt, the second part. So tell us about\nyour childhood and your parents.\nMatilde Neuwirt: I was born in Belgrade, Serbia on December 26, 1930. My parents, Solchi\nmother and Bugich father were born 1n the same area on 1897 my father. In 1905 my mother. I\nhad a brother born in Vienna. His name is Yosef Bubi and sister Dolly born 1924 and my brother\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nInterview with Matilde Neuwirt 4\nDecember 11, 2011\nwas born 1924 and my sister 1928.
