The same thing like here. Naturally I had to learn a trade. You know why, I think my father was a very wise man. He used to say, malucha is maleecha. What this is in English, if you have a trade, you have a kingdom. You know, he was a businessman but he said anything can be taken away from you. But what you learn and you have -- how to say in unet, an education, nobody can take it away from you. He was very wise. Thank my trade, the truth is I survived. So now I can tell you, you know, the way I growed up. I growed up, I learned my trade and my father, my mother they had a business. Was a factory and my oldest sister was in the business. You know, it was not a small business. As a fact, when the Germans come in, they come into Poland, in 1939, in the fall. In 1940, right away, they put it up laws like everybody knows. They confiscated everything what it up laws like everybody knows. They confiscated everything what the Jews have."

That\u2019s -- took us about 15 minutes to go into Warsaw. That\u2019s nearer. The Germans, when they come in, in 1939, this was the fall.

            "answer": "My home was a Jewish home. I remember, you know, I don\u2019t know if you know, it was a habit. On Saturday, Jewish people didn\u2019t travel. Ifa Jewish man, after sundown on Friday, passed through, not to break the Sabbath, he used to go in, in the synagogue and every Jew what was This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

This mean guests, what they take home for Sabbath and they sheltered him and they fed him. Saturday night when the stars come out, it was already no more Sabbath, he was ready to continue his -- how to say in English -- his -- to go where he wants to go, travel. He can begin to travel. So like I told you before, we had a business and we were making a living. Talking about my family, a lot of time I asking myself, how come I survived. I was already that time, not Hasidic, was a freethinker. I already like today, the younger people, begin to think their own way. In this my father and mother was very charitable people. Because I know when you live in a smaller city, in the suburban, then the neighbors, some neighbors, not all of them, certain people in the community, they didn\u2019t have no fish, they didn\u2019t have no meat, they didn\u2019t have no challah. To us, the mother used to call up and it was delivered and it was not like here, papers. Because that\u2019s what I learned. If you give something, don\u2019t brag about it. Is a fact, if I donate money, I don\u2019t want it to even -- people should know what I do. This comes from the household. Okay, in the forty already, my father opened up a shop for me.

            "answer": "After the school, after the school you had to go and learn a trade. In a trade, take you several years. You know, in the beginning they give me two dollars a week. I said two zloty you couldn\u2019t buy too much for it. But look, if you want to learn, you got to learn. My father used to say, look anybody can be a businessman but if you have a trade, you have a kingdom. I want you to learn. Why he was thinking this way; because my father\u2019s brother in Warsaw had a big business from the stores where they used to sell clothing. He used to have cutters, designers. He was very good off and he wanted me in case I need it, I should have something to fall back on it. My father said, in Europe, you know a guy what used to sell shoelaces or used to sell some cigarettes, he was a businessman. Anybody cannot do this without education. So he want me to learn a trade. I learned my trade pretty good. When the Germans comed in, I already had my shop and I had two people working with me already. I already was teaching somebody else, younger kids. This was going on, this was the style in Poland."

            "question": "Did you -- was it like a Jewish neighborhood, your shop? Were your patrons mostly Jews or not, or both?",
            "answer": "We had Jewish people, Polish people, you know. Yeah, everybody. It was not that time, a ghetto. No, we were living together in a smaller place. We were living neighborly. It was not a-. The truth is we didn\u2019t in the city of B , It was not a big population from Jewish people, the opposite. Kaluszyn was the population from 90% Jews. Sabbath, you couldn\u2019t get even a glass of water. It\u2019s the truth -- Sabbath -- when they were calling to go to the synagogue- it was a style. You know what I mean, they were calling when it was around three o\u2019clock, they used to call . You know they used to call to go to the synagogue. The stores were closed and everybody was preparing to go to the synagogue. Over there in B , it was already a little more advanced, a little difference, you know what I mean. The people when there was sundown, everybody was dressed and they went to the synagogue. A different style, was already more to the south. This was in southern Warsaw, south, and Kaluszyn 1s to the east, on the other side of Warsaw. You have Warsaw, Prager and then you have Minsk, Mhzowiecki, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection you have Kaluszyn, you have Wegrow, you have S , you have more to the Russian side, to the east. And so it was a difference, a different city, a different setup between the Christian population and the Jewish population. We didn\u2019t have this kind of --like 1t was in some other places. But naturally, the German influence, the propaganda after passed away. You know what I mean, the anti-Semitism propaganda began to influence, you know, the Polish people. It\u2019s a fact when the Germans comed in, in 1939, like I told you in the fall, the war didn\u2019t last too long. It last maybe eight, ten days. The Poles didn\u2019t want to fight. The Germans, what I know about it, the Jewish people, the Jewish boys what they was in the Polish army, they would do the fighting. Because we expected from the propaganda, when the Germans will come in, what is going to be. It\u2019s a fact that the Germans already took Poland, it was divided Poland by the book, between Russia and Germany. The Germans comed in, the Germans took away the quarters of our house, from our house. A big officer happened to take up from our house, half a house. When he comed in, he was like a hyena, like an animal. But you know, a Jewish woman, a Sabbath, she cooked fish and meat and mached a yulk an aroma. The German officer was over there and you know, little by little he became domesticated. My mother used to bring him something to eat. After several weeks, four weeks, or six weeks, he used to come in, he used to say Frau Fishman, v didn\u2019t you go to Russia? Because Hitler what he said, he\u2019s going to do it, he\u2019 II kill everybody. He stood in the light and he said, I\u2019m sorry, such a nice people, they should be wasted. But in the meantime, you know what I mean, he realized, he said something what he shouldn\u2019t say it. So he said, please don\u2019t repeat what I said because he looks like he was afraid for himself, you know. Anyway, you know, after several months, you know what I mean, the Germans begin to tighten up the city like they used to take --. The first thing they took away everything what the Jews have. The radios, if you have a motorcycle, or you have something, they took it away. You couldn\u2019t have nothing, they cut it off everything. We had a housemaid. The housemaid, her name was Marta. She happened to marry a guy by the name, Bernard from Zh _\u2014_\u2014. He was a very educated guy. He was a director of a Swedish factory what makes matches. You know, strikels are matches. When the Germans comed in, he put it down a big eichenkrist a red belt with a black eichenkrist and he became a big man in the German thing. Over there, we have the German neighbors, Volkdeutschen. Volkdeutschen, a lot enlisted themselves to the Germans. The Germans naturally give the order they shall take the Jews for work. Naturally, they took me too. I knew them and they knew me. Lazora\u2019s son, they has son from the west. You know, a young man like me, I know the guy what they grabbed me for work. I used to say then, Poland was a Poland and you didn\u2019t act this way. He said to me, keep shout and kicked me in my behind, otherwise, you\u2019ll get shot. I realized that this is the truth. I have to do what I have to do. When [Il come to talk about this Bernard --. You know, he happened to marry the Marta, he didn\u2019t hurt nobody. He didn\u2019t hurt nobody. Is a fact, every time when I -- when they pushed us out from the city --when it come the time when every Jew have to get out from B , ZO into the Warsaw ghetto, he was the guy when he used to drive through with a truck, he used to drop me off azach. You know, it was a big -- with bread. He used to go through the ghetto. Opened up the door, he used to say, stay in this corner and I\u2019Il throw you out a sack of bread for my family. While when we was in B , he had a bag radio. We used to hear the BBC from the underground. Between me and you I think he was working for some government. Not for the Germans, it is the truth. Otherwise, we used to close the door and we used to sit and hear from BBC received from England. Why did he have the honor to have the thing? His brother was a captain in a U-boat. But he was speaking a perfect French, a perfect English, a perfect German, a perfect Russian. Till today, I have only a suspicion that he was working for a foreign government, I don\u2019t know. Or for England, or for America. He did good. He saved maybe three times from my death. Oh, yes. Because when you\u2019re young. We had the kids. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Not far from B was a factory from sugar. We need sugar. I took the bicycle, it was not too much, a few kilometers, I run down and get sugar over there. Took off the armband and went down over there. In the meantime, it was, what do you call this, a roundup. Why was the roundup? The Poles killed a couple Germans and they took the helmets, excuse me, they shit in the helmets. They put it in their chests, the helmets. You know what I mean? While they was there, they making a roundup, I was over there too, in the middle. In the meantime, they grabbed me and I was laying on the ground. Ill never forget a German come through. He had three squares on his shoulder. I was laying on the ground and a German was staying with a gun over me. He said to me, he said to the guy, the kerl is a strong kerl, why you keeping him like this? He asked me what are you doing here? I said Bernard sent me to get some sugar. Who\u2019s Bernard? I said he has this number, here is his card. He said to me , get lost. Believe me, on the bicycle I was flying. I was not pedaling, I was flying. I come back to him and he said to me, why you didn\u2019t tell me. In other words, you know, check us. Why you didn\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going over there. You\u2019re doing things, one of these days, I\u2019m not going to be able to help you. It was several times what he saved me. That\u2019s the reason I can say about him. That is the chapter. All right so we was in Warsaw now."

The Germans already begin to put out laws, a law they needed young people to work. Everything was covered, how to say, they didn\u2019t know what they needed people. If they give the order in Warsaw, they need 500 people for work, the Jewish gemeinde, they had to give them 500 people, a thousand people. You know how many people they want, there to bring it. I was the oldest, I begin to smuggle in some food for the family.

I used to smuggle in sometime with horse and wagon, you know, some bread, potatoes. He used to bribe the guard. The guard used to ask me what you have there. I used to leave the horse and wagon over there in the corner and approach the gate. It was soldiers, my lieber, my lovely men, would you please let me in. My father sick, my mother sick, the kids are sick, I have some bread, I have some potatoes. You never said how many you have because if he\u2019 ll step on the wheel and look it in, you have more -- I used to say a bisel, a little, never say how much. Because he could say why did you like to me? Always a little. It was going on for weeks. You know I used to bring it in -- one time it was a rainy night. I approached the gate to drive in and I give them a golden watch to drive in with my loot, what I had. They stepped on the wheel, they looked in. He says to me, why did you lie to me? I say, my lovely sir, I never lied to you. I told you a little of this, a little of this, a little of this. He turned around his butt from the gun. He smacked me over the head, opened up my neck. The blood was running, but you couldn\u2019t run away. Then you give him a leverage to shoot you. You had to be near him till he gets sick and tired from hitting you, then he said, get lost.

In 1942, I went out from the ghetto. It was already so bad. Old people were laying in the streets, you know, dying. Climbing their hands and knees and begging a bissel water, a drop of water.

You know, you walk, so we come to the bridge and they recognize me as a Jew. You know, I told them. I offered them the 50 zloty what I had. But they said, no they want gold. They thought every Jew had gold and diamonds. To tell the truth, I don\u2019t know if I should say in the desk, I always carry around a knife, a big knife in my boot. I had to -- and in the bridge over there between Praga, one soldier with a machine gun was going one way and the other was going the other way. I went over to the German and I said, burglars, you know, thieves running after me. So they took up the machine gun, they put it out a series of bullets. There in the other side, they grabbed a tramway, a streetcar, an electric streetcar, and they met me on the other side. I already went through the bridge. They said to me in Polish, give me the 50 zloty. I pulled out my knife, I said come on, take it. It took me a night and a day walking. I come to Wegrow. Wegrow was an open ghetto.
