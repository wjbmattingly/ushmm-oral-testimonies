The same thing like here. Naturally I had to learn a trade. You know why, I think my father was a very wise man. He used to say, malucha is maleecha. What this is in English, if you have a trade, you have a kingdom. You know, he was a businessman but he said anything can be taken away from you. But what you learn and you have -- how to say in unet, an education, nobody can take it away from you. He was very wise. Thank my trade, the truth is I survived. So now I can tell you, you know, the way I growed up. I growed up, I learned my trade and my father, my mother they had a business. Was a factory and my oldest sister was in the business. You know, it was not a small business. As a fact, when the Germans come in, they come into Poland, in 1939, in the fall. In 1940, right away, they put it up laws like everybody knows. They confiscated everything what it up laws like everybody knows. They confiscated everything what the Jews have."

That\u2019s -- took us about 15 minutes to go into Warsaw. That\u2019s nearer. The Germans, when they come in, in 1939, this was the fall. In the fall, they took about seven, eight days, the war was over. Poland didn\u2019t fight."

            "question": "Can we back up though? Before we get into the war --. I\u2019m sure we\u2019re get involved in talking about that. Can you tell us anything else about your home? What was it like in your home? What did you?",
            "answer": "My home was a Jewish home. I remember, you know, I don\u2019t know if you know, it was a habit. On Saturday, Jewish people didn\u2019t travel. Ifa Jewish man, after sundown on Friday, passed through, not to break the Sabbath, he used to go in, in the synagogue and every Jew what was able had to take home a couple orchan. This mean guests, what they take home for Sabbath and they sheltered him and they fed him. Saturday night when the stars come out, it was already no more Sabbath, he was ready to continue his -- how to say in English -- his -- to go where he wants to go, travel. He can begin to travel. So like I told you before, we had a business and we were making a living. Talking about my family, a lot of time I asking myself, how come I survived. I was already that time, not Hasidic, was a freethinker. I already like today, the younger people, begin to think their own way. In this my father and mother was very charitable people. Because I know when you live in a smaller city, in the suburban, then the neighbors, some neighbors, not all of them, certain people in the community, they didn\u2019t have no fish, they didn\u2019t have no meat, they didn\u2019t have no challah. To us, the mother used to call up and it was delivered and it was not like here, papers. Because that\u2019s what I learned. If you give something, don\u2019t brag about it. Is a fact, if I donate money, I don\u2019t want it to even -- people should know what I do. This comes from the household. Okay, in the forty already, my father opened up a shop for me. I was already, I had my education in tailoring --."

            "question": "After high school?",
            "answer": "After the school, after the school you had to go and learn a trade. In a trade, take you several years. You know, in the beginning they give me two dollars a week. I said two zloty you couldn\u2019t buy too much for it. But look, if you want to learn, you got to learn. My father used to say, look anybody can be a businessman but if you have a trade, you have a kingdom. I want you to learn. Why he was thinking this way; because my father\u2019s brother in Warsaw had a big business from the stores where they used to sell clothing. He used to have cutters, designers. He was very good off and he wanted me in case I need it, I should have something to fall back on it. My father said, in Europe, you know a guy what used to sell shoelaces or used to sell some cigarettes, he was a businessman. Anybody cannot do this without education. So he want me to learn a trade. I learned my trade pretty good. When the Germans comed in, I already had my shop and I had two people working with me already. I already was teaching somebody else, younger kids. This was going on, this was the style in Poland."

            "num": 8,
            "question": "Did you -- was it like a Jewish neighborhood, your shop? Were your patrons mostly Jews or not, or both?",
            "answer": "We had Jewish people, Polish people, you know. Yeah, everybody. It was not that time, a ghetto. No, we were living together in a smaller place. We were living neighborly. It was not a-. The truth is we didn\u2019t in the city of B , It was not a big population from Jewish people, the opposite. Kaluszyn was the population from 90% Jews. Sabbath, you couldn\u2019t get even a glass of water. It\u2019s the truth -- Sabbath -- when they were calling to go to the synagogue- it was a style. You know what I mean, they were calling when it was around three o\u2019clock, they used to call . You know they used to call to go to the synagogue. The stores were closed and everybody was preparing to go to the synagogue. Over there in B , it was already a little more advanced, a little difference, you know what I mean. The people when there was sundown, everybody was dressed and they went to the synagogue. A different style, was already more to the south. This was in southern Warsaw, south, and Kaluszyn 1s to the east, on the other side of Warsaw. You have Warsaw, Prager and then you have Minsk, Mhzowiecki, you have Kaluszyn, you have Wegrow, you have S , you have more to the Russian side, to the east. And so it was a difference, a different city, a different setup between the Christian population and the Jewish population. We didn\u2019t have this kind of --like 1t was in some other places. But naturally, the German influence, the propaganda after passed away. You know what I mean, the anti-Semitism propaganda began to influence, you know, the Polish people. It\u2019s a fact when the Germans comed in, in 1939, like I told you in the fall, the war didn\u2019t last too long. It last maybe eight, ten days. The Poles didn\u2019t want to fight. The Germans, what I know about it, the Jewish people, the Jewish boys what they was in the Polish army, they would do the fighting. Because we expected from the propaganda, when the Germans will come in, what is going to be. It\u2019s a fact that the Germans already took Poland, it was divided Poland by the book, between Russia and Germany. The Germans comed in, the Germans took away the quarters of our house, from our house. A big officer happened to take up from our house, half a house. When he comed in, he was like a hyena, like an animal. But you know, a Jewish woman, a Sabbath, she cooked fish and meat and mached a yulk an aroma. The German officer was over there and you know, little by little he became domesticated. My mother used to bring him something to eat. After several weeks, four weeks, or six weeks, he used to come in, he used to say Frau Fishman, v didn\u2019t you go to Russia? Because Hitler what he said, he\u2019s going to do it, he\u2019 II kill everybody. He stood in the light and he said, I\u2019m sorry, such a nice people, they should be wasted. But in the meantime, you know what I mean, he realized, he said something what he shouldn\u2019t say it. So he said, please don\u2019t repeat what I said because he looks like he was afraid for himself, you know. Anyway, you know, after several months, you know what I mean, the Germans begin to tighten up the city like they used to take --. The first thing they took away everything what the Jews have. The radios, if you have a motorcycle, or you have something, they took it away. You couldn\u2019t have nothing, they cut it off everything. We had a housemaid. The housemaid, her name was Marta. She happened to marry a guy by the name, Bernard from Zh _\u2014_\u2014. He was a very educated guy. He was a director of a Swedish factory what makes matches. You know, strikels are matches. When the Germans comed in, he put it down a big eichenkrist a red belt with a black eichenkrist and he became a big man in the German thing. Over there, we have the German neighbors, Volkdeutschen. Volkdeutschen, a lot enlisted themselves to the Germans. The Germans naturally give the order they shall take the Jews for work. Naturally, they took me too. I knew them and they knew me. Lazora\u2019s son, they has son from the west. You know, a young man like me, I know the guy what they grabbed me for work. I used to say then, Poland was a Poland and you didn\u2019t act this way. He said to me, keep shout and kicked me in my behind, otherwise, you\u2019ll get shot. I realized that this is the truth. I have to do what I have to do. When [Il come to talk about this Bernard --. You know, he happened to marry the Marta, he didn\u2019t hurt nobody. He didn\u2019t hurt nobody. Is a fact, every time when I -- when they pushed us out from the city --when it come the time when every Jew have to get out from B , ZO into the Warsaw ghetto, he was the guy when he used to drive through with a truck, he used to drop me off azach. You know, it was a big -- with bread. He used to go through the ghetto. Opened up the door, he used to say, stay in this corner and I\u2019Il throw you out a sack of bread for my family. While when we was in B , he had a bag radio. We used to hear the BBC from the underground. Between me and you I think he was working for some government. Not for the Germans, it is the truth. Otherwise, we used to close the door and we used to sit and hear from BBC received from England. Why did he have the honor to have the thing? His brother was a captain in a U-boat. But he was speaking a perfect French, a perfect English, a perfect German, a perfect Russian. Till today, I have only a suspicion that he was working for a foreign government, I don\u2019t know. Or for England, or for America. He did good. He saved maybe three times from my death. Oh, yes. Because when you\u2019re young. We had the kids. Not far from B was a factory from sugar. We need sugar. I took the bicycle, it was not too much, a few kilometers, I run down and get sugar over there. Took off the armband and went down over there. In the meantime, it was, what do you call this, a roundup. Why was the roundup? The Poles killed a couple Germans and they took the helmets, excuse me, they shit in the helmets. They put it in their chests, the helmets. You know what I mean? While they was there, they making a roundup, I was over there too, in the middle. In the meantime, they grabbed me and I was laying on the ground. Ill never forget a German come through. He had three squares on his shoulder. I was laying on the ground and a German was staying with a gun over me. He said to me, he said to the guy, the kerl is a strong kerl, why you keeping him like this? He asked me what are you doing here? I said Bernard sent me to get some sugar. Who\u2019s Bernard? I said he has this number, here is his card. He said to me , get lost. Believe me, on the bicycle I was flying. I was not pedaling, I was flying. I come back to him and he said to me, why you didn\u2019t tell me. In other words, you know, check us. Why you didn\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going over there. You\u2019re doing things, one of these days, I\u2019m not going to be able to help you. It was several times what he saved me. That\u2019s the reason I can say about him. That is the chapter. All right so we was in Warsaw now."

My father said he wants to bring the first child to the hippa, you know to the altar. When I got married, it\u2019s a tradition. When I got married, he said to me, my son now you have to think about how you\u2019re going to survive. So after the wedding, naturally I begin to -- I\u2019m the oldest son -- my father was that time maybe, maybe 42 years old. The Germans already begin to put out laws, a law they needed young people to work. Everything was covered, how to say, they didn\u2019t know what they needed people. If they give the order in Warsaw, they need 500 people for work, the Jewish gemeinde, they had to give them 500 people, a thousand people. You know how many people they want, there to bring it. I was the oldest, I begin to smuggle in some food for the family. You know, don\u2019t forget there was still six people, father and mother, everybody we had some things what we were able to cash in, trade whatever you had. People begin to do business in the ghetto. I\u2019ll never forget there was a Jewish man by the name Rubinstein. He used to stay in the corner and used to make vixin. You know what vixin 1s -- jokes. He used to say schmaltz. That means fats will be cheap. People would ask him why. . That mean the rich people melting out, they don\u2019t have no more money. Everybody\u2019s going to be poor, you know. In the morning, in the ghetto, life in the ghetto. People used to be laying in the streets, in the sidewalk. Used to go around a horse and wagon and picking them up. It was not even enough what to bury them. They used to wrap them up in gasha you know in papers. Wrap them up and bury them. I was going around, it was already so bad, --."

You know when the -- they already made, how to say, when you going in, you had to open up a piece of wood like in the military to open up, to go in. I used to smuggle in sometime with horse and wagon, you know, some bread, potatoes. He used to bribe the guard. The guard used to ask me what you have there. I used to leave the horse and wagon over there in the corner and approach the gate. It was soldiers, my lieber, my lovely men, would you please let me in. My father sick, my mother sick, the kids are sick, I have some bread, I have some potatoes. You never said how many you have because if he\u2019 ll step on the wheel and look it in, you have more -- I used to say a bisel, a little, never say how much. Because he could say why did you like to me? Always a little. It was going on for weeks. You know I used to bring it in -- one time it was a rainy night. I approached the gate to drive in and I give them a golden watch to drive in with my loot, what I had. They stepped on the wheel, they looked in. He says to me, why did you lie to me? I say, my lovely sir, I never lied to you. I told you a little of this, a little of this, a little of this. He turned around his butt from the gun. He smacked me over the head, opened up my neck. The blood was running, but you couldn\u2019t run away. Then you give him a leverage to shoot you. You had to be near him till he gets sick and tired from hitting you, then he said, get lost. I turned around the horse and wagon, bloodied like a slaughtered animal. I went to another gate, I went over, I give them my briefcase. He looked at me, I\u2019m so bloodied, he opened up the gate, I give him the briefcase. You drove in, you unloaded what you had in the horse and wagon. Then you was asking yourself, why didn\u2019t you go right away to this gate? It\u2019s a question, how do you know which is good and which is no good? You taking your chances. In 1942, I went out from the ghetto. It was already so bad. Old people were laying in the streets, you know, dying. Climbing their hands and knees and begging a bissel water, a drop of water. Nobody could help them, nobody could help each other. Or you die or if you can, survive."

You have to go through the Vistula, that\u2019s a river. When I went out, the Polish youngsters used to say, , a Jew runs away from the ghetto. What I had, I had 50 zloty, what is 50 zloty, you couldn\u2019t buy even a cigarette. It was not money. But I was walking. You know the streets was already bricked up with bricks, with glass on the top. I saw like a dog, we had to duck under, under the bridge in the street, and climb through and you walk. You know, you walk, so we come to the bridge and they recognize me as a Jew. You know, I told them. I offered them the 50 zloty what I had. But they said, no they want gold. They thought every Jew had gold and diamonds. To tell the truth, I don\u2019t know if I should say in the desk, I always carry around a knife, a big knife in my boot. I had to -- and in the bridge over there between Praga, one soldier with a machine gun was going one way and the other was going the other way. I went over to the German and I said, burglars, you know, thieves running after me. So they took up the machine gun, they put it out a series of bullets. There in the other side, they grabbed a tramway, a streetcar, an electric streetcar, and they met me on the other side. I already went through the bridge. They said to me in Polish, give me the 50 zloty. I pulled out my knife, I said come on, take it. It took me a night and a day walking. I come to Wegrow. Wegrow was an open ghetto. Now begins the real thing. Wegrow was an open ghetto. It was a city, a Jewish city where they used to over there. You know what it is, they used to write the Torah."

All right, I was fighting them as much as I could. You know it was by the name, ; hierarchy, you know, what they wanted for the Jewish gemeinde, they had to -- listen they want to save their family. I was a stranger so they send me away in acamp. Star . They were making over there an airfield for the Germans from the woods.. They should taken off to attack the Russian front.

They were going with clubs, banging over the knees, he shall go straight or the other, how to say, why you\u2019re doing this way. Anyway, every day was several deaths. For fun, they used to take out a strong guy, the same hose where they used to put in the gasoline, they used to put it in the hose. They used to say to the guy, let down the pants, put it in the hose and let go the gasoline. The guy used to lift up, used to light a match and throw him. He used to burn like a, like a -- you take and sometimes you see in the jungle there, with a stick, you know what they burn in a fire."

But this way, you keep[ always sweating, always sweating from frightening. Might as well --. Anyway when I come back to the ghetto, I didn\u2019t went into the ghetto. I sended in a guy to tell to my wife, I\u2019m over here. She already knew. You know why, because when she come to the gemeinde, to the hierach from the Jews where they\u2019re giving out a loaf of bread, they told them the Warsaw bird already run away. After this, they send me away to M , another camp. It was a small camp, just how to say to take it out the youth. That the city shall be less Jews. Treblinka was not ready yet, not ready, how to say, to__, to destroy the people. It was still building the crematoriums. They keep over there, it was over there a couple hundred Jewish people, women, men. Then when they liquidated, they come back to the city. When I come back, I was always frightened from the police. I was sitting, I give you a sample in the house and I was doing some tailoring because the farmers, when I fixed them a pair of pants or I made them something, they used to bring me a loaf of bread, a bag of potatoes, a chicken. Because I didn\u2019t need no money. The only thing what I need is just to survive. When the police saw me, I\u2019m sitting in the window, they used to run. In Europe, a cellar is not like in America. In Europe a cellar 1s just like in the kitchen. A hole and its big boards. It was a deck, like a door. For the winter used to store potatoes or something. What I did, in the bedroom, I used to rip it up a couple of bolts and make over there another hole, lift it up, it was not a mattress like a shan __, lifted up this and let myself in. When they come in the house, they said, I just saw him in the window, where is he? Where did they look, I disappeared. So they were looking there and went away. I had a couple hours work to do. In the meantime, when the farmer come, he brought me the -- several potatoes or anything, I had something to eat. When it was very bad, I had to hide somewhere in an attic. My wife used to -- she had an aunt over there, Mimi Lia, she used to cook up something and bring me up the attic because they were looking to send away people and I was hiding out. It was so bad, it was already m_ Yom Kippur, the end of Yom Kippur. Already they was taking people, sixty year old, was not youth, in Wegrow."

I was fighting the commandant, I was fighting _____, because I proved them at one time, I ambushed them. You know what an ambush 1s? You know in Europe, it was a door when you closing the door with a big title, this 1s an iron bar. I took the iron bar and I grabbed the commandant. I say, if you don\u2019t lay off, you see one bing, your brains is going to be in the wall. Because I didn\u2019t have nothing to lose. I was already dead one way or the other. Finally they said to me, Washua, _- , we'll do our job to you. They\u2019ll do it to you. When it was already bad, m_ Yom Kippur, they surrounded around the city of Wegrow. Looks to me like Treblinks was ready, seven kilometers from Treblinka. I have a, what you call this, I was sick. You got sick, too, what is it. Typhus, typhus. She got sick, the family, the family was still alive over there in Wegrow, they took her home. I was over there in the room where they give me to live there with another family. Naturally when you have typhus, you know the heat, the fever is very, very . It was over there a girl and the boyfriend used to sit attending his girlfriend, he attended me. Her boyfriend was not sick. He used to put her down cold water on the head, he put cold water on mine head. I always told him, Schema, when I survive, I'll never forget you. When I got better, I remember, we -- they were living near the shield. It\u2019s down the hill. You know when I went down to see how she\u2019s doing, the wind was carrying me. Well, she got better and naturally we went to the shul. The shul was already destroyed. The less Jews were gathering in a barn. They\u2019re crying and begging to God, they\u2019re praying. If such a thing exists, the skies would split from the tears. We come back, in the night. The Germans went around, you know what ludens are, shadows. With the bietnam, in the shadows, Juden roust, Juden roust, you know what I mean. In the morning, they had to market all the Jews what was survived already. Old people, I was between the youngest because they couldn\u2019t do nothing with me. They loaded them in horse and wagon and they shipped -- they drove them up to Treblinka. I was still there. Me and my wife, we was hiding in this hole what I had beside the cellar under the bed. What I did, I opened up the door from the cellar and show to him, who will come in, the door was open, how it was already clean, no Juden. Because that time already. The Jews knew they made double walls, they climbed in, in the chimneys to hide; they hide in the attics. It was outside the toilets. A lot let themselves in the shit up to the chest, just to breathe, just to breathe. Over there in a small city, they had cows, they had chicken. The cows were without food, without a thing, were making moo, you know. When I, in the morning had got gray, I looked through the window. I saw a cat passing by. I said look, how lucky, they\u2019re not going to shoot the cat but if I stick out my neck and somebody saw it, bingo, I get a bullet in my neck. But it got a little lighter, I went down back to the hole. The Germans come in, in the house. I heard them. They were shooting in the walls because a lot of Jews had double walls, they were hiding in the walls. But a lot of Jews made mistakes, they took it in the walls, a clock. When you come in, in the house you can hear a clock. They looking for the banger from the clock. A lot of Jews they found between the double walls. They took them out and they took them to the cemetery. They had to dig their own graves, they shot them. I come to this, Ill tell you how I know how they did it. After sitting in this hole, for ten days without food, without water, I'll never forget, the walls in the grave were so shiny from my sweating, from frighten, it was like a mirror. Finally it come on me such a -- I got so scared -- I said to my wife, let\u2019s get out from here. Let\u2019s go in the back. There is over there a single house, painters were living over there. Let\u2019s go up in the attic over there. You know what she told me. My heart tells me I\u2019m going to stay here. You want to go, you go yourself. I grabbed her by the collar. I said look, when I say go, you go. Is a fact she wanted to go out from the ghetto, from V but the ghetto was already surrounded around by the Polish police, the fire department, gendarmerie, the Ukrainian, the Litvakian, all around. She wanted to get out, she couldn\u2019t get out, she had to come back in the same hole what I was there. She couldn\u2019t get out. Otherwise, she tried to get out as a Christian girl. She had to come back."

The first thing when I come up in the attic, I opened up at ___ alittle door. You know what I mean, from the old side was in the pitch from the roof is a little door. I say to take away the suspicion open up. If it\u2019s closed, they\u2019ll put it up a ladder, they want to see if somebody\u2019s there. I count up over there, it was the family from the painters. So what I did the first thing, I put them under the eave and took all the rest and covered them. My wife the same thing, I covered them. I opened up the piece of rope from the desk, opened up. I, myself, took a piece of iron. When they\u2019ll put up a ladder and they want to see who it is, hey, you smack them over the head, you\u2019ll kill them, you get up and they\u2019II kill me. That is -- mine thing is over. Lucky enough, they didn\u2019t come up to this attic but they went in another house where the door was closed and they took down a whole family. They were manufacturing leather, leather. They took down the whole family over there to the cemetery to be slaughtered. How I know what they did. One girl come back from the cemetery. She come back to this -- upstairs where we were over there. She told us what was going on in the cemetery. The Germans let her go, she was so beautiful, she was really beautiful. He looked at her, maybe he had a daughter her age and he said to her , get lost. Oust but get lost. She come to us. She told us what was going on over there in the cemetery when they brought the people. They had to dig their grave, a trench. They undressed them and they shot them with a machine gun. They fall down and the Poles were staying over there and taking off the rest what is over there -- for sample, the stockings or the underwear. They robbed them. That she told me what was over there.

When they took already the remnants, what is left over, you know when the fire department and the other, this was the last when they put us in a gathering place, like a jail. Anything what they could, they shipped us off. My wife brought me two loaves of bread, you know with a piece of rope. You know, this was the last. They shipped us off. My plan was when thy put us up in trucks -- they put it up, the Germans with machine guns. My plan was when they\u2019I|I take a curve, the truck has to slow down, I'll jump. I couldn\u2019t jump because if I would jump, he was on the truck, I would get a machine gun. My plan was if I'll come down to the camp, I\u2019Il bury myself under the truck. When the truck will go out, I'll drop myself. It didn\u2019t work either. When they took us out from the truck, we went inside, the truck went away. Now comes preparation when we comed in.

They come with a machine, cutting off your hair and the hair fall down to the baya. I tell you true, I was already sick and tired from running. This was already my last trip. I said look, all right, what is going to be, Pll be here. I already give it up. I couldn\u2019t take it no more. When did I decide to run. When they cut me off the hair. I had a head of hair and I looked myself in a can. You know, the Germans when they had the rations, is the tin cans, you could see yourself. You know, like a mirror. I saw myself, I didn\u2019t recognize myself. I say no, I rather be killed, Pll run. In the meantime, in the morning, I had to stay in the line to get food. What was the food in the morning? The wheat, you know what the \u2014 half a skin, they call this kryen. They take it off the skin and the rest is flour. You know what you're able to bake. They mixed it up with water. In it was stinking, it was soil. The people was already over there for months before I come.

They managed to still work, they had diarrhea, they were working and shitting, working and shitting. When they gave me the food, it was stinking, so I give it away.

You making a big gutter, how the water shall run into this gutter. The people, the elflinger where they working had to rip it out the roots because it was swamp. It was big piles of the roots to dry in the swamps. You had to go in, it was already ice, thin ice but they were staying with the bullwhips. If you don\u2019t go in, they will bullwhip you. You had to go in, in the swamp six footers, lower, lower, lower till the end.. Me, a greenhorn. I comed over there, it was cold. It was already thin ice like the glass. I try to hide but the police was staying, I had to go in. One happened to be a Jewish policeman, happened to be too. __, a Jewish boy, a schoolmate of hers. He said to me Washula, you go in. I couldn\u2019t go in, it was already ice. I tried to hide under the roots. So he pulled the whip. I grabbed the whip on the other side. I pull it. Why I pull it, 1t was running with my neck, I open him up his face, he was bleeding. I said look I\u2019m going away from here, the Ukrainian will come, they\u2019 ll shoot you. This was the night when I decided, I will run. I come back to the barracks. He was sleeping. I was sleeping in the first and another Wegrowak, Ulek was sleeping in the other. In the night, we had the toilets, we had outside. Outside the barracks. It was a, I don\u2019t know what you call this, like this here. It was like this. In here was a stick, you had to climb up and shit into the hole. To the rest, it was not, how you say enclosed. It was everything open. Ulek says to me, give me \u2019s scarf. You know what it is, shake my hand, you\u2019re not going to leave me. I said fine, we\u2019re leaving tonight. They give us our coats, our ripped coats. The pillow was stuffed with grass and we decided tonight, we\u2019ll leave the camp. It was wired, barbed wire, but the wire was maybe about 12, 15 inches apart. You know it was reflectors all around, in the woods. So I the night, I went over to the wires, you know, had reflector, goes around. Meantime when the reflector goes one side and this side is dark, before the reflector come to you, you laying in the ground. When it gets dark, you go up again and you come to the wires. You taking the jacket and you throw over the barbed wire, barbed wire points. He grabs it and you pull him down, you knocking out the lights. When you\u2019re knocking out the lights, the machine guns begin to fly. You can feel every bullets what goes by your head. You know what I mean, cuts the air, you know every bullets what goes by near you. You dropping to the ground and you begin to climb. It took me several days. I didn\u2019t went into the ghetto. I sended in a Polish guy what I used to do tailoring for and tell him, I\u2019m back. See, she was still over there in the ghetto. So after a day, we escaped. We escaped from there and we went out in a colony. In a colony, I come over there to a guy by the name, what was his name, Munich. I was working for him over there. When I went out from the ghetto, I had to have a piece of bread or something, I used to go out from the ghetto, it was open ghetto, I used to go in the village walking over there in the colony. When I was working over there for a couple weeks, I made with him friendship. When there was already no Jews, little Jews what they\u2019re going around looking, who was still hiding, I went out over there and I took the girl what I told you come back from the cemetery 1n a crossroads. She went one way. I went to this guy Munich. Why she went over there, her father like I told you, he had leather. She knew a Polish guy what he had the leather and she went to this guy over there. But a couple of weeks later, I found it out that she got shot by the Felt gendarmerie. It used to be Felt, used to drive around in the fields looking for Jews and she got shot over there. I was over there with the guy Munich. One night he called me in, he said to me I\u2019m such a good friend of yours. He used to deliver to the Germans somagun. He used to make vodka for the Germans. He used to make to deliver to the Germans, vodka. He used to deliver from the Polish farmers, grain. It was a noma how much every farmer has to give to the Germans for the army. He says to me I\u2019m such a good friend of you. If you would see what they\u2019re doing to the Jewish people when they capture them, they putting on ropes. They\u2019re putting on ropes, one leg are up and the other leg in the cars going apart. They\u2019re ripping them apart. He says look, you\u2019re such a good friend, I couldn\u2019t be able to live with myself if I would see what they\u2019re going to do to you. I'll go into the city if you want, I\u2019ll bring you poison. This is going to be the end. He already had -- mine what I had. Naturally when I come to him, what I had I give him away. I said, look, if I\u2019m going to leave you, why don\u2019t you give me at least a piece of material. When I\u2019Il go to a farmer, at least he\u2019 ll give me a loaf of bread for it. You know what I mean? He says you\u2019re not going to need nothing. You\u2019ll go out from here. It was a group of Poles used to go around and killing the Jews because the Germans give them a reward for each Jew, give them a kilo of sugar. This is two and a half pounds of sugar __if you bring them alive or dead. So he told me I don\u2019t need anything. But luckily I survived. I went -- I told him where will I go? I took my wife under the arm. It was already late fall, very late fall. I'll never forget, it was already the sugar beets was already the last what you have to take it off. The leaves used to flop in my boots back and forth. I was going with my wife; everybody\u2019s already killed. Her parents was already taken to the cemetery to be shot. The brother was shot, the mother had to take him out. I found it out later, the mother was taking him by the legs, the father by the arms because the brother was shot in the house and bringing him to the cemetery. They got shot over there. Her mother and father. With the and with the younger daughter, with the younger sister here. I come over there to another guy, Genchel, another guy. It was already -- I went through -- I was working through the whole winter between the farmers. Over there is a style under marriage. One farmer\u2019s daughter married to the son, the son 1s married to the other, are chained, a whole village is under related. What it was, I was working for the farmers, for the winter, making clothes. You see, my father was smart. I was making clothes, making pants, jackets, heavy coats, you know what I mean. I give you sample, of I had a job what took me a week, I used to make it three weeks. I was interested in time. While I was there, I was safe. Because if they would find me over there, they would shoot the farmer with the family and then they would shoot us. I saw when I was over there I was safe. Nothing do to me. I was going from one to the other till the winter was over. If the Jews what they was over there in the colony, they used to come in, I used to talk in the farmer to give them a loaf of bread to give them a pail of water, I saw when they\u2019 ll stay away from here. The Germans should not find out that the Jews are running this colony. Finally, a whole winter, it went through. We survived the winter. The end of April, ---."

If you don\u2019t let me go down to the bath, \u2019'm not going to make him better, I\u2019Il go down by myself. So she give me a bedpan. When I moved my bowels, they saw this is a broken appendix, they brought me back in between the sick, they piped me up like a plumber. Two pipes in my nose, pipes in my arm. What you call this, intravenous. From the other side, the blood. They put me down under a big lamp and they brought me up the next day in the morning. They told me to count to ten and I went out, I didn\u2019t know. When they brought me up the next day and I looked through my hand, I could see the bones, I was yellow. A few days later, they used on me the first invented aureomycin.
