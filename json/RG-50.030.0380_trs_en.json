            "question": "I'd like to start by having you tell us just basic information about when and where you were born and take us rather quickly, if you would, to where you found yourself in the spring of 1945.",
            "answer": "Well, that covers quite a bit of territory. I was born in St. Joseph, Missouri, on March the tenth in 1920 and I was the fourth of five children and eventually my father and mother took in a cousin who was orphaned. So there were three boys and three girls in the family. I went to school locally in St. Joseph, Missouri, and of course grew up during the Depression. That covered quite a long era. We all worked. It was the usual paper route, selling magazines, eventually working in the drugstore and working my way through school as much as I could. Fortunately, we had a junior college in St. Joseph and I was able to go there for my first two years and get an Associate Arts degree. But after that, Iran out of money, so I was in search of jobs that would pay more. With that in mind, I went out to Colorado, where I had an older brother and his family, and I worked in an amusement park in Colorado \u2014 Lakeside Amusement Park. It was a very good job for the summer because a lot of college kids worked there as they did in ranches, dude ranches, in Colorado. So it was very pleasant work but by the end of the summer I still didn\u2019t have enough money to go back to school. So I went back home \u2014 I was homesick and my folks wanted me to come back. I went back around Thanksgiving of 1939. And made enough money to enter my first year of college\u2014 of podiatry school. I\u2019m almost afraid to go down that alley because it was my first profession. I went there because Dad wanted me to be a doctor. I didn\u2019t want to be a doctor but this was the next best thing. In fact, it was difficult at that time, even to get into medical school. There were Jewish quotas. But I did go to Chicago and I talked to the registrar and when I came home during the summer of \u201939, to make a decision as to what I wanted to do, I decided to go to podiatry school. Well, that was in the fall of \u201941, and we know what happened on December the seventh. During the Christmas holidays, although they asked us to remain in school as much as we could, everybody was gung ho. We wanted to get into the army and fight the Japanese because of this atrocity that they had inflicted upon us at Pearl Harbor. Well, I tried to get into the Navy but, at that time, they were very strict and I couldn\u2019t get in on account of my eyes, plus the fact that they did encourage us to stay in school \u2014 at least to finish that year, which I did. I went back to school, but during the week of finals, I got the orders to come report to my selective draft board and fill a quota and I did. I came home and went into the army. I went into basic training to , Texas, with the 95\" Infantry Division. I had had ROTC in high school at that time. ROTC was very good because we were able to wear uniforms and it would save on our clothing. Although they tell you never to volunteer for anything in the Army, when they asked if anyone had had any close order drill, my hand went up and I was immediately put in charge of a platoon. At the end of the first month, fortunately, I made PFC. The second month, I made buck sergeant, I\u2019m sorry, corporal, then buck sergeant, that\u2019s three stripes, then staff sergeant. Then I was ready to go to OCS. I wanted to get out of there as soon as I could. I had a first sergeant, was regular army, very anti-semitic, and when I put in my papers for OCS, he didn\u2019t send them into headquarters, so I didn\u2019t get to go."

            "num": 3,
            "question": "Did you ever talk to him about that?",
            "answer": "Yes, yes, and the reason he didn\u2019t put the papers in, although he\u2019d called me, in all the promotions that I got, I found out that he kept saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want a kike (ph) on my staff\u2019. The other officers would override him and I was promoted from time to time, through the ranks. The reason he didn\u2019t send me to OCS was he was going out to the 97\" Infantry Division and he wanted me to go along with him, which was quite a strange thing, until you think of the fact that I did all his work. And also, one of the officers in my company said that I was going through too fast and that OCS 1s very difficult. They were flunking out at least half of them and it would do me good to have a little more training, a little more of a sense of army, and what\u2019s expected of me, and the extra six months or so that I\u2019d have to spend would be to my advantage. And it was true. I did go to OCS and it was very difficult. I think around 520 of us matriculated and there were maybe 200, 280 or 85 that finally graduated and got their bars. Then we were sent to different camps. I finally ended up at a headquarters company at Camp Blanding, Florida, doing various jobs. And then went overseas."

            "num": 4,
            "question": "When did you go overseas?",
            "answer": "Went overseas during the winter of \u201842-43. We were stationed in Preston, Lancashire, and we crossed the channel on a Polish ship called the Sobiesky (ph) and when we got midway through the channel, there was a lot of submarine and anti-aircraft activity by the Germans, so we had to back to Southampton. I later read, after the war, that the ship that left Southampton the same time we did was torpedoed."

            "question": "The general time of year?",
            "answer": "Oh, it was during Christmas, it was during Christmas. It was the same night that Glenn Miller disappeared over the channel. Which later came into a lot of things that I did after the war, or a lot of things that I thought about as being \u2014 if something took off, took of paramount importance to me, I would think of the time that I crossed the channel, and how lucky that I was. When they said that, \u201cyou get on this ship, or you get on this ship, how many are in your complement\u201d, I said, \u201cSix officers and 96 men\u2019. \u201cOkay, you get on this one, you get on that one.\u201d We were lucky enough to get on the Sobiesky (ph) that turned back. The other one was torpedoed, with a loss of about 90% of the personnel. I didn\u2019t know this until after the war ended, when they were printing these statistics. At any rate, we landed. We had to go over the side of the ship with a rope ladder and landed in landing craft and went into LeHarve(ph). Now this was after the invasion, and although we weren\u2019t being shot at, it was still very difficult and very cold wading through the water until we get onto dry land. Once, and I\u2019m going very fast because there\u2019s quite a bit to cover, once we got into France, we started moving very rapidly. In fact, I know there were a lot of articles written about Patton streaking across France and into Germany and across the Rhine, across the Raymoggan (ph) bridge head, which we crossed, and into Tree Air (ph). Then we went to, we were in the battle of Baston, we were in Belgium, Luxembourg, and then into Germany."

So there will be a time period that will have quite a spread. Now with the Third Army, i 1 hope -- it would have been nice if it all happened that quickly to bring me to this point, but I know that this is the major thrust of the interview."

            "answer": "Yes. Vividly, vividly, it was daylight. Those who were left, there were still bodies burning in the ovens, and we could still smell it. In fact, after the war was over when my mother would fix a chicken and try to burn off the little feathers that were left, I had to get out of the house. I couldn\u2019t smell that odor, that odor that gets into your nostrils, and never leaves. I\u2019ve never bought a pair of striped pajamas in my life, because that\u2019s what they were wearing \u2014 these striped pajamas, and I know what happened. I kept salivating. You know there\u2019s, before you vomit, something happens to the salivary glands and it\u2019s kind of a, well if you\u2019ve ever done it, if you\u2019ve ever had it, you know that it just, before you give it all up, there\u2019s, you know that you're going to throw up. And that\u2019s rather indelicate, but this is what happens. Some of the dead were in very grotesque positions, leaning against a tree with their legs covered, and dead. Just all sorts of, maybe some in fetal positions, lying in the camp. Those who were still alive, in the barracks, if you could call it a barracks, they were sort of lean-tos with straw, were so weak that if the one next to him was dead, he didn\u2019t have the strength to push him off so that he could at least have maybe the small luxury of being able to turn around on this pallet that had been his bed for many years. We did whatever we could \u2014 we did in the way of food, whatever we could give them, whatever help we could give them, but we were still moving on. I was still with the combat troop. Actually, I had a litter bearer platoon, and my men were the ones who saw the first casualties, the first line of casualties, and would carry them back to the evac hospitals that were in the rear of the combat line. We did whatever we could to make them comfortable. I heard that, after we left, there was such pandemonium, and I think that this continued until the end of the war, there was never, nothing ever ran smoothly, it seems. As much as we tried, there was always some trouble brewing somewhere and something to be taken care of, that needed immediate attention. But I understand that the Burgermeister (ph) of Ordruff (ph) was murdered by the inmates who were left and his body was dismembered and he was strung up on a tree in the center of town, the civic center. I think this is true."

Some spoke Russian, some spoke Polish, some Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Estonians, Latvian. They came from the Balkan countries as well, Romania, Hungary. There was a whole cacophony of voices and languages but we knew one thing. They all had one thing in common \u2014 that they were free. And I think, I think, wanted to get revenge. I probably would have behaved in the same way, to avenge six years, some of them, of torture, of having their families taken away from them. And murdered in such a manner, in such a diabolical manner, that we\u2019ve all learned about since then. I didn\u2019t know all this at that time. I was aware..."

But I just sensed that most of them were, because by then, what had been written in the Stars and Stripes, which was the army newspaper in Germany, or in Europe, we started hearing about these atrocities. But I didn\u2019t have any visual evidence of it until I went into the concentration camp. I didn\u2019t know how they got there, well, I knew how they got there, they were forced there, but I didn\u2019t know until later on when I read how they were put in vans, and put on trains and in boxcars and the methodical way that they were loaded into boxcars with the elderly going in first, pushed in. And then the younger ones and then the younger children and then perhaps, from six on down, they were just picked up by their legs and thrown into the boxcar to land on top of whoever was there and then the boxcar was sealed. If they had to defecate, or urinate, they had to do it in place, in the boxcars. The boxcars came into play, when the vans that they used to gas \u2014 you know they would use vans and they would hook a pipe onto the exhaust and put the pipe into the van and by the time they got to Treblinka, or Auschwitz. . . I didn\u2019t know all this until much later. When I saw them, well, they were prisoners who hadn\u2019t been fed who worked for the German war machine and given, not even, minimal rations. Not even just something to keep them going so they could keep the war machine going, and when they couldn\u2019t any longer do that, it was off to the ovens. That was all I knew then."

            "answer": "No. No. By then, by the time we got there, the guards had disappeared. They tried to kill as many as they could before they left. A lot of what went on there, we were told as we went on, as we left, and talked to each other about what had been happening there, and were given all sorts of lectures, again, on what had been happening in these camps. I didn\u2019t see firsthand where they worked \u2014 they weren\u2019t working anymore.

I couldn\u2019t help but think, of course, there but for the grace of God, go I. I and my antecedents were all from Russia, and I could very well have been one of the inmates of the concentration camp, had I lived in that surrounding, in Russia. The entire village, I later learned, the entire village that my parents and grandparents lived in and aunts and uncles whom I\u2019d never met and cousins \u2014 they were entirely wiped out. I later learned that they were all herded into a barn and the barn was set on fire and as they tried to escape, they were machine-gunned. This 1s in 1939 when the Germans went into Poland. I didn\u2019t know that that happened. I just know that we stopped getting letters from my grandparents in 1939. We stopped getting mushrooms. They used to send mother \u2014 my grandmother used to send her dried mushrooms and she made delicious mushroom and barley soup. That all stopped of course."

What we should have been doing was talking to them and getting this beautiful, beautiful background that they had in Europe. I know later on when I\u2019d take Mother for a ride in my car and we went out into the country because I came from a small town, in Missouri, and when the wheat was being harvested and the corn, she\u2019d take it in. She\u2019d smell the wheat and she\u2019d say, \u201cOh, this is just like home.\u201d It was always home. And oddly enough, in the many years that I\u2019d been away from St. Joe and I\u2019d been away to school and in the theater, I\u2019ve been away altogether, I guess, close to 50 years, whenever I told my wife, whenever I talked about home, she always knew that it meant St. Joseph. It wasn\u2019t where we were living at the time. That was a house. And we\u2019ve lived all over the world. And I guess the army took me all over the world, too. But home, home was always St. Joe, the way Russia was always home to Mother and Dad. And I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t find out more about that.

I do know, and it might have been, it might be a rumor, but I was told that our Air Force, who did almost pinpoint bombing, eventually, was told not to bomb any of the German military camps. Or any of the IG Farban (ph) buildings. Now the IG Farban was this tremendous cartel that had quite a bit of American money involved in it. The army barracks, we knew that we were going to have to use them for the displaced persons, until they could be repatriated. Now it wasn\u2019t that difficult to send the western Europeans back, who\u2019d been slave laborers, send them back to France, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy \u2014 although Italy was Allied Germany for a while \u2014 they were also working in the war effort and had to be sent home. But we couldn\u2019t do anything with this tremendous, tremendous horde of eastern Europeans until we made contact with the Russians and that took \u201ctil the end of the war, and then some.

Or to get into the work of repatriating the displaced persons. I thought if I could, that whatever I could do, that I would try. In fact, it became a problem to the United States Army before the war ended, because when the camps that were overrun, eventually all of them, knew that they would get better treatment from the United States Army, and, as we progressed, I would see hundreds, literally hundreds, thousands even, Russians walking, displaced persons walking along the street, along the highway that we were driving on to get from one town to another. They had to be put in camps, otherwise we couldn\u2019t feed them, we couldn\u2019t clothe them, we couldn\u2019t control them."

Governor Lame (ph) and I recall reading in the Stars and Stripes that the Jews were being treated worse by the American army and by Unrah, (ph) and so on in the camps, than they were in the concentration camps. Well, this wasn\u2019t true, entirely, but there was some truth in it. They didn\u2019t know whether to put the Jews in with all the other DPs, or, because the Jews were stateless, they were homeless then.

They all had to fill out what they called a Fraggoboggen (ph) \u2014 are you familiar with the questionnaire that the Nazis had to fill out? Well, it tells about their history in the Nazi Party and of course all of them said that they didn\u2019t, or many of them had a supplement to it, which I have here, and I\u2019m going to leave with the Archives \u2014 a supplement to the Fraggoboggen (ph) that this one man filled out. \u201cT was never a member of the Nazi Party.\u201d That\u2019s what he said. \u201cI was never involved in any of the atrocities.\u201d They all were.

Or when they started coming after the Germans who disagreed. And the Catholics who disagreed, after they got through with the Jews and the gypsies and the homosexuals. That\u2019s when people started taking note. Maybe there\u2019s a juggernaut that we can\u2019t stop \u2014 that we\u2019re going to need help.

By being on temporary duty and away from my original company, I wasn\u2019t able to draw any rations \u2014 any of my rations from my company \u2014 like cigarettes. We were able to get liquor, too, incidentally. Heavens knows we needed a little schnapps once in a while. Cigarettes, liquor and candy. And when I tried to get it from my company, they said we didn\u2019t draw any rations for you because, PX rations, I guess they called it, because you\u2019re not assigned to us. You\u2019re away on temporary duty. And when I tried to get it from the army headquarters, they said, you\u2019re not on our roster, you\u2019re only here on temporary duty. So on one of the times that, on one of the times that my camp was being inspected, when the officers got through, there were about eight of them, and I have the listing here of all of them. The general just happened to mention, \u201cYou deserve a lot of credit for the work that you\u2019ve done here.\u201d And I said, \u201cI deserve a rest.\u201d\u2019 And the rest of the officers \u2014 I guess their chin dropped between their knees because you just don\u2019t talk that way, . Very G.I. And he said, \u201cOh, what would you like to do?\u201d And you know, I was very young then, and very flip. I said, \u201cI think I'd like to go to the Riviera for ten days or so.\u201d He said, \u201cOh, how soon could you be ready?\u201d \u201cHow soon could you get a man here to replace me?\u201d He said, \u201cCan you be in Munich at 5:00 or 9:00 in the morning or whatever? We\u2019ll fly you to the Riviera.\u201d \u201cCertainly I can be there.\u201d So before going, we had a camp barber \u2014 and the reason I\u2019m telling you this 1s because one story begets another story \u2014 and he was cutting my hair, I had hair then. He was a Frenchman and I told him, I said, \u201cNow I want you to do a good job because I\u2019m going to the Riviera. I\u2019m going to stay at the Hotel Carlton. I go to Nice and to Monte Carlo while I\u2019m there.\u201d He said, \u201cMy family lives in Cannes. I haven\u2019t seen them in eight years \u2014 I haven\u2019t written to them and there\u2019s no way that they could write to me. Would you call on them?\u201d I said, \u201cOf course.\u201d He gave me their address of where they lived. They lived up above Cannes \u2014 Gros(ph)? Well, and one day I took a cab and went up there and I met his family and I invited his sister, a little 16-year-old sister to come back to the hotel with me to have dinner. Well, the Hotel Carlton, this is where they have the Cannes Film Festival, as you know, and everything is very, very elegant there. There\u2019s a waiter behind each chair. The little girl was sitting there, I don\u2019t she\u2019s ever, I don\u2019t what she\u2019s ever had in the way of food, or the way it was served, but I want you to know it was quite elegant. And she brought a little bottle of perfume for me as a gift for letting her family know that her brother was still alive. That little bottle of perfume is the only thing that I have left. When I came back to the states and we staged at Camp Philip Morris \u2014 you know they named the staging camps in France after cigarettes \u2014 I had a musette (ph) full of souvenirs \u2014 perfume, lighters. I had a bottle of, I had a fifth of Three Feathers, which 1s bourbon liquor that my dad had given me two years before. He said, he wanted, he said, \u201cYasilah, (ph) I want you to give this to your colonel so he won\u2019t send you overseas.\u201d And I thought to my, I told my commanding officer, I said, \u201cMy dad wants me to give you this so you won\u2019t send me overseas.\u201d We both had a good laugh. I thought if we landed safely, I'd break open the bottle. Every celebration that we had, I was going to use that bottle that my dad gave me. I never did. I never did because there was always liquor available. And this became kind of an icon, kind of a talisman. I thought as long as I had that, nothing\u2019s going to happen to me. Because it somehow, it\u2019s somehow sacred. When I had this in my musette (ph) bag, with that little bottle of perfume, along with perfume for all the women in my family, Chanel, and Flue de Racai (ph), and all the Caron and I had lace from Belgium that I had picked up and saved to take home as souvenirs. Everything was stolen out of my stateroom but that little bottle of perfume. And, the bottle of bourbon. And my dad and I had the first two drinks out of that bottle. Well, I came back from the Riviera and kept working and for a while, we went, I was sent to Veeldflecken (ph). Now Veeldflecken (ph) was taken over by an Unrah (ph) team and we were already old hands at this. I only spent two weeks there, about two weeks, and a member of the Unrah (ph) team was Kathleen Hulm (ph) who later wrote \u201cA Nun\u2019s Story\u201d, that was made into a movie with Audrey Hepburn. And I met her and I have a copy of her book. I had a copy of her book but it\u2019s now in the archives, here in the museum. It\u2019s out of print and it\u2019s a wonderful, wonderful account of how a displaced person camp is run, and how it should be run. All the trials, all the vicissitudes, all the problems, all the glory and all the good feelings that you have when you see a job well done. I came back to Bamburg (ph) and by this time there was quite an attrition among the officers and enlisted men who were going back to the States. They\u2019d earned enough points to be sent back and I was put in, they had spread us out over several camps and I was sent to Koburg (ph) and that\u2019s where I had my greatest glory if there 1s such a thing. And I\u2019Il tell you what happened at Koburg (ph)."

Because they had been fooled by Stalin. Stalin even sent special troops into the area to sort of prepare the people for coming home by telling them that you\u2019re going to come home, you\u2019re going to be with your families, you\u2019re going to be on your farms, you\u2019re going to be in your villages, and life is going to be like it was before. It didn\u2019t happen. Once the boxcars were sealed, I don\u2019t think they were really sealed in the manner that the boxcars were sealed, that\u2019s probably not a good word. Once they were closed and they started the long trek to the East, when they got there, stories came back that they weren\u2019t even allowed to go into their own villages. That they went on to various goulag in Siberia and spent so much time because Stalin, Stalin sent his own son to one of them, who\u2019d been in Germany as a slave laborer.

We would put them on trucks and the trucks, incidentally, belonged to the 1 1\" Panzer (ph) Division. They were SS troops, run by Major McLean (ph), and this is a walking stick that he later carved and gave to me. Here it says, Coatsing (ph), that was their headquarters, May the 5\" 11\" Panzer (ph) Division, 1945. Although it\u2019s a Scottish name, he was quite German. He had a complement of 175 vehicles, German vehicles. Some of them were halftracks, some were regular trucks, some were similar to our jeeps, and some were what you might call pleasure cars, for officers, perhaps an Opal, or one of the other small German car, Volkswagen. And we would load them onto these trucks. We gave them five days ration for the long trek back to Russia or Poland, to their villages. We saw that they were well clothed, we saw that families went together, quite unlike the transports that went to Treblinka and Auschwitz."

But some of them stayed in Germany who heard about what was going on after they were being repatriated. Some of the them wanted to stay in Germany and work on the German economy.

They send \u2014 and they decorated the trucks with boughs. It looked like Arbor Day. They put all sorts of tree branches on the trucks. Then they had huge photos of Stalin and Lenin and they sang Russian songs and we had Russian officers at the exchange points, at Lichtenfelds (ph) to see that everything was run properly, that they got on these trains.

But we couldn\u2019t do anything else \u2014 they couldn\u2019t live with us for -- in the camps forever. They couldn\u2019t live on the German economy forever. Even the Germans were having \u2014 I didn\u2019t sympathize with them that much, only as one human being to another \u2014 but they were having a difficult time. As a matter of fact, those who saved Jewish children started turning them over to the American army so that we would make different billets and different camps for them. And I think I showed you earlier, in the chronology of what happened during the war, that the Joint Distribution Committee and they were a tremendous during the war, a tremendous help. They saved my life many times. Gathered up orphans from Buchenwald, in the Buchenwald area and sent them to France. I received orders from Third Army headquarters to form an orphanage for Jewish children who\u2019d been turned back by the Germans who had saved them during the war and were turning them back to the army to be fed and clothed by army personnel. And there was a sanitarium, the Strooth (ph) Sanitarium. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve mentioned that name in years. But now I know, that was the name of it. The Strooth (ph) Sanitarium near Onzbock (ph). And I was to get 40 orphans to billet there and my main adversary was an American officer who received orders about the same time that I did for the orphans, he received orders to find billets for returning German prisoners of war. And I had to put up a big fight to get this Strooth (ph) Sanitarium for my orphans. And instead of getting 40, over 200 came in. And while I\u2019m on the story, the Joint Distribution Committee had teachers, or they had people who \u2014 they were preparing these orphans for Israel, like the Opon (ph) and they taught them Hebrew, they were teaching them folk dancing. And it was a wonderful, wonderful camp and wonderful experience for them. And one day, one -- a little girl from the camp came into my office and gave me that block of wood that\u2019s now in the archives at the museum. She had carved what looked like the Fleur de Lee (ph) that the Girl Scouts \u2014 apparently they were basing their training perhaps on what they do with the Girl Scouts. And she gave this to me and I saved it all these years, 50 years, until I came here 1n the end of June to turn over a lot of my artifacts and that\u2019s one of the things that I gave to the museum. I later heard from her, from Israel, it was Palestine then, telling me how happy she was. I haven\u2019t been able to find that letter. I saved all the letters that I received. My dear, dear sisters saved all the letters that I wrote for four years in the army and I have a journal for almost every day because I wrote quite a bit and I had a little high school girl working in my home the past month or so before school started and she was putting the letters into polyurethane sleeves and so far she\u2019s used 1200 sleeves. It doesn\u2019t mean I wrote 1200 letters. This is just the year of 1945 and beginning of \u201946 before I came home. But several of my letters were five and six pages long. But I\u2019m so happy to have this all, all four years preserved. And also letters that I got from different people \u2014 I\u2019m doing the same thing with them. But I haven\u2019t found her letter. I haven\u2019t found her letter."

It so happened that one of them belonged to a baroness. She came into my camp and begged me not to touch her trees. We had to. We had to. It was in our area and we needed, we needed the wood. Before \u2014 now, do you know that Germany was divided into four parts after the war? The American Occupied Zone of Germany, the British, French and Russian Occupied Zone. During the early days of the Russian occupation of Germany, which was just north of us, I found out that there was a warehouse that had the leather pants that the SS troop, the motorcycle troops wore. And there were hundreds of thousands of those leather pants. So Germans, well, many Europeans love rubber stamps. If something has a rubber stamp on it, 1t must be authentic. So I had a bunch of rubber stamps made up, in Koburg (ph), in one of the offices that made them and it said, \u201cPlease give bearer, whatever, the above merchandise,\u201d and stamped it military government, Unites States Military Government. I\u2019ve forgotten now what I put on it. But I sent these German trucks up to Soldenburg (ph), which was just beyond the American Occupied Zone of Germany and into the Russian Occupied Zone. And they loaded those trucks up with all the leather pants. Now the reason I did that is because in my zone, my area, there was a shoe factory. They didn\u2019t have any uppers, but they had all the Airsots (ph) leathers, Airsots (ph) soles. And we were buying these things, we were buying equipment from the German \u2014 or articles of clothing from the Germans for the DPs and for the slave laborers. We were able, with one pair of leather pants, we were able to make six pairs of shoes. Now I wanted to bring one pair home, as a souvenir, but I thought if I bring a pair of shoes home, that means somebody\u2019s going to have to without shoes, and I didn\u2019t. Oh, oh, do I think of that, when I see the shoes in the museum. That\u2019s what I think about \u2014 what we did so that they\u2019d have shoes. DPs. And what they did, and what they did when they took the shoes off -- the Jews before going in the undressing rooms -- before going into the crematoria. So worried that our men wouldn\u2019t have shoes and they were so worried that they couldn\u2019t take \u2018em off fast enough. They\u2019re in the bin, aren\u2019t they \u2014 in the museum. That\u2019s what I think about. Well, I received a letter of commendation from another major. I won\u2019t read it \u2014 it\u2019s on record, thanking me for this ingenuity. But you do things. I don\u2019t know where it comes from. You \u2014 I set up a theater. You have pictures of that. They had their own entertainment. We had a hospital \u2014 we had a wonderful hospital. I also had Polish army personnel attached to my camp."

DPTA10 \u2014 that was the name of my camp. Oh, what a badge of honor that was \u2014 for them. It gave them the run of the camp. They had wonderful uniforms to wear \u2014 it was kind of a mixed uniform \u2014 American officer uniform and Polish officer uniforms.

And they wanted to stay, they worked very hard and it was an opportunity for them to learn English, from us, and we learned as much French as we could from them. Now, you asked me, about the camp that I was coming back to..."

And when they realized that this camp was really a repatriation camp, a camp that was sending people back east, when they realized they couldn\u2019t go back, then they wanted to get to Jewish camps. And who took them to the Jewish camps? What irony. My German major from the Panzer (ph) Division in his trucks. Loaded them up \u2014 and he knew. And I knew that he knew. But they got very good treatment and they went to camps in southern Bavaria. There was Ogsburg (ph), there was a camp in Ogsburg (ph), there was a camp at Strowbing (ph), there was a camp, there was one they called the Funk Casairn (ph). Casairn (ph) means camp. I knew that that was a Jewish camp and he and his men had orders to take the Jews."

            "answer": "Beginning, beginning in winter of \u201945 and early \u201946. Now, when, when Unrah (ph) started taking over the camps, I was transferred. I\u2019m trying to think if there was anything more I wanted to tell you about Koburg, except that 1t was running rather smoothly, although people started trickling back and telling their countrymen that they weren\u2019t allowed to go home, that they were sent to Siberia. So that meant that more came in and that we would have to continue to take care of them. On Bastille Day in camp, one of the French officers almost blew up the camp celebrating Bastille Day. Jacques Jencam (ph) was his name. And when he left, he told me if I ever got to Paris to be sure and look him up, which I later did, but that\u2019s, Pll go into that. Now, I, when the work was running smoothly in the camps, and, as I said, they had their own hospitals, they had their own entertainment. We were invited to many of the affairs that they had in camp, as guests of honor, and I went. I danced to many a oom- pah-pah band and Polish, and the polka. I liked to dance. Then I was transferred to Onzbock (ph) which was outside of Nuremburg. And I was put in charge of several DP camps and also the exchange point at Hoapf, (ph) Germany, and we have that on the map. Now the reason it was called an exchange point is because, apparently, and I believe it was at the Yalta Conference, we, that is the four major powers, said that we would repatriate the Germans, also, who had been displaced because of war. German for German, who had been displaced prior to September the 1\u00b0, 1936. And they all, and they came from Russian zone into the American zone through Hoapf (ph), Germany. And I was in charge of that exchange point. Excuse me. And it was through this exchange point, the Jews came in. They also had gone back to Poland, or wherever. And they thought that they, well they did, they knew their homes were already occupied, their farms had been occupied, and they were being killed. The progroms had started. A little anecdote. When the Allies got onto the government of Poland, after the war, immediately after the war, and started chastising them for starting these anti-Semitic picadilloes again, this one telegram that they got, or communicae that they got, said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand how you can be so unhappy with us. We\u2019ve only burned one synagogue since last August.\u201d This 1s what was happening. Lodz (ph), Lodz (ph), the city of Lodz (ph), that had 200,000 Jews before the war, two of them came back. The Lodz (ph) Uprising. When they were subdued, they were all taken out, but 40 of them hid 1n the, in various cellars, underground sewers. This is why they either didn\u2019t go, or went and came back. Poles wanted to kill them. They didn\u2019t want to give up their homes. They didn\u2019t want to give up their farms. I\u2019m not talking about the Poles that came to American during the mass migration in 1906 and 1909. They came for the same reason my folks came \u2014 to get away from religious persecution and to have a better life for their children. There was a Polish family that took care of all of us in Saint, little St. Joseph, Missouri. They were like brothers and sisters to my father and mother because they spoke Polish. My folks did too -- Russian Polish. These are people that had been so indoctrinated with the hatred who had helped, I think they showed the Nazis a few things, and so did the Estonians and Lithuanians and the Latvians. They came out smelling like a rose, too, after the war. To make Patton say, when he talked about the dirty, filthy Jews, he said, \u201cThey\u2019re nothing like the Estonians.\u201d Well, how could they be? Where was the soap? Where were the water levels in the billets that they were in? There wasn\u2019t any water, there wasn\u2019t any running water! How could they use the latrines or the toilets? He didn\u2019t think about that. And it was against his Anglo-Saxon sensitivities to put them in German homes. You can\u2019t displace Germans! For the Jews? \u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. I\u2019m digressing."

I said, \u201cPut them all in jail at Hoapf (ph).\u201d Now this is in Mittenwald (ph). Mittenwald (ph) is the county and Hoapf (ph) is the main city.

It amounted to just the same as the paper \u2014 but I didn\u2019t want to have any of the evidence because of what was going to happen. I knew I would have to account for it. By morning, by morning, they were all out of jail. The guards had been bribed with money, with drinks, with liquor and the Jews were on trains, again going to Jewish DP camps in the American Occupied Zone of Germany. The story doesn\u2019t end there with me. I was called into the office\u2014my commanding officer\u2019s office \u2014 who was a colonel. And I shan\u2019t tell you his name. I\u2019ve never mentioned his name. He was regular army. He had appropriated the finest chalet in Onzbock, for his family. They were coming over. After all, this was a war of occupation. He had appropriated one of Hitler\u2019s specially built Mercedes-Benz bullet-proof touring cars for his own. And he called me in because the security officer at Hoapf (ph) told him what had happened. He said, \u201cWhat do you know about this?\u201d I said \u201cWell, I know that 125 Jews, approximately, 125 Jews tried to come across the border last night and I told the captain to put them all in jail.\u201d He said \u201cWell, they\u2019re all gone now. Where do you think they are?\u2019 And I said \u201cWell, I think they\u2019re all very happily ensconced in Jewish DP camps in Bavaria, in southern Germany.\u201d He said, \u201cYou know, this is conduct unbecoming an American officer and I\u2019m going to have to court-martial you.\u201d Well. \u201cWe, Pll send for someone from the Judge Advocate Division, Third Army headquarters to come up and take a deposition. Meanwhile, you\u2019re under arrest of quarters at the Golden Eshtairn (ph) Hotel.\u201d I found this the other night. I knew something would happen \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be able to put my hands on these things. Nevertheless, that\u2019s where we were billeted. It was a little embarrassing to go from his office, with two MPs, one on each side of me and put me under arrest of quarters in my hotel room. And I could only leave to go to eat, also, under guard. He, I saw him afterwards, before the, it would have been the attorney from the judge advocate, judge advocate\u2019s office, whatever, to come up and take a deposition prior to a court martial \u2014 I saw him. My colonel. And I said, \u201cColonel\u201d \u2014 now I want you to know that I was just a kid, according to what I am now, I was just a kid, but you grow up very fast in the army. I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to me if you court martial me. I\u2019m sure I'll be breaking rocks at Fort Leavenworth. But you\u2019re going to be right beside me.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said, \u201cI'll just have to tell them how you allowed all your men to go into my DP camps, your officers gave them furloughs and leaves to go into my DP camps and shack up with the women in the camp. You gave them extra rations. You drew army rations that you shouldn\u2019t have so that they could have a wonderful time sleeping with my women in the camps!\u201d They were so bold and so blazen about this that they walked around in their uniforms.

And all this happened under your nose.\u201d What\u2019s 125 Jews? There were close to a thousand. This had been going on for months. And it worked. It didn\u2019t mean anything to him.

And I\u2019m so proud of them. I\u2019m standing right in the middle of them. I just wanted to be with them because of what they were doing. They were trying to find, ostensibly, they were trying to find, survivors of the relatives of members of the Palestinian Brigade. Well, this is true, they were, and they did find as many as they could. But, it was to be a cover for the Jewish Underground. And what they were trying to do was to get the sympathies of the American Jewish officers, mostly American Jewish officers, although a very dear friend of mine that I worked with who is non-Jewish helped a lot. And therein lies another story but, and when they realized that I would do all that I could to help out, they, they were satisfied and pleased. And I think, I think if, if the museum would blow up this photo that I had, that there might be some faces on there that are easily recognizable because I\u2019m sure that they later became leaders in the state of Israel or in, again, with repatriation of, of Jewish DPs, Jewish slave laborers.

But of course those who came through my camp at Koburg (ph), I knew when they were coming through and I knew when they were going out with the, in the trucks and they got special care \u2014 food, clothing. Years later, well let\u2019s go back to where, if you like, where I was almost court-martialed. Is that alright? Anyway, I was put under arrest of quarters in Onzbock (ph). In the Golden Eshtairn (ph) Hotel. And as I said before, I told the colonel that you can\u2019t, that the responsibility was all his and it was under his command. Now and he had all his family coming over, they were all ready to come over for the duration, however long that was going to be. And the next day, there were orders that came from Third Army Headquarters sending me home. That\u2019s among the orders that you have. Now they would send divisions home, they would send battalions home, and my orders came through, one person, Captain Joe Friedman, report to Camp Philip Morris. And I was escorted by the two military government, by the two MPs, to the train. We went by car to Frankfurt \u2014 we got on the train there for Paris. Now Jacques Jangcam (ph), who had the Bourbon (ph) signet ring, or crest, told me that if I ever got to Paris, to call him. Well, we had to change trains, either from the Guardinore (ph), or whatever. I don\u2019t remember because, because it\u2019s been 50 years ago. But I took a chance and I called him. Had his phone number in my little book when I knew I was going through Paris and I called him and he asked me \u2014 and he was home! And he asked me where I was and I told him I was at the train station. And I told him what the circumstances were \u2014 that were two MPs guarding me \u2014 but at the time they were looking at magazines and French postcards in the train station. And he said, \u201cI know that train station.\u201d He said, \u201cI'll be over there. You stay in the phone booth and pretend that you\u2019re talking to me. I\u2019Il be over there in about ten minutes and when you see me in the doorway, you come out of the telephone booth and come right to where I am and we\u2019 ll get in my car and I\u2019Il take you home \u2014 to my, to my home.\u201d And that\u2019s what happened. I don\u2019t think anything happened to the MPs, because they were all so happy to get rid of me. I\u2019m sure that when he went back, when they went back to Onzbock (ph), and told the colonel what had happened, he probably felt that it would be fine if I was arrested for being AWOL, or whatever. But, what actually happened was that Jacques took me to his home. And his home happened to be a floor through apartments, apartment in the Trockadeero (ph) Section of Paris. And you could see the Eiffel Tower from their home, their apartment. And it was the type of apartment that the elevator opened up into their, well as long as it\u2019s French I\u2019d better say foyer, but it opened up into their foyer. And I, his grandmother lived with them, and I received her, I was given her suite of rooms while I was there, which consisted of a sitting room, a bedroom and a bathroom. And I was served breakfast in bed. In fact, I had to wait until the maid got out, left the room so I could get out of bed and put the tray on the dresser so I could have breakfast comfortably. I found out what the signet ring was: their dining room \u2014 they had tapestries all over the, all over the apartment and they were these tapestries that depicted all the wars that the Bourbons (ph) had fought in from whenever to wherever. And he was the descendant of the kings and it didn\u2019t mean anything to him except that he had this signet ring that he wore. And it was also in needlepoint on the back of all the chairs in the dining room. And Jacques had a sister who showed me around Paris. We went to the Louvre \u2014 we did all the typical tourist things and I was there for about four days. I was very anxious \u2014 I was a little afraid that something might happen and I did leave after, I think it was four or five days. But I\u2019d been to the Leedo (ph) and the Moulon (ph) Rouge and the Casino de Paris and to the Napoleon\u2019s tomb and the famous cemetery \u2014 well, whatever. I'll think of it. And I got to Camp Philip Morris. I could have stayed in Paris for a month! When I reported there, they said, \u201cWell, you\u2019 Il go out on the next available ship, boat.\u201d Washtub is what it was. It was a victory ship. I crossed in the Amsterdam, the SS something Amsterdam which was a huge luxury vessel. Took us four and a half days to cross \u2014 took me ten days to get back, and it was during that time and I was in a stateroom with other officers, and that\u2019s when all my things were stolen. With the exception of that one bottle of perfume and the fifth of Three Feathers. That was a very popular brand of bourbon during the war that I later had with my dad. Then, I came home and I had a very difficult time. I was being separated from the service at Jefferson Barracks and I sort of broached on this subject when we were talking before, but the first person I saw was a friend of mine that I grew up with in St. Joe and he was playing cards in the officers\u2019 recreation room. And I ran up to him and I said, \u201cPaul!\u201d You know, I was so happy to be home! I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be in St. Joe! They\u2019re shipping me out tomorrow! Is there anything you want me to tell your folks \u2014 I'll call them!\u201d And he said, \u201cEh, I see them every weekend.\u201d He had spent the entire war in Jefferson Barracks. I guess he did something. Something that was necessary to the war effort. But it hit me, really, how . Four years I\u2019ve been in this man\u2019s army. Finally got home. I\u2019d been home before on furloughs and on leaves during the time that I was in the States. My army career was sort of evenly divided. I, I spent two years in the States and two years in Europe. Then I was ordered to report to the parade grounds at Jefferson Barracks before being separated from the service. And I was wearing my captain, my captain\u2019s bars and I thought oh-oh, my AWOL caught up with me. Here it comes, the saber, you know, cutting all these things off. But instead, that\u2019s when I was given the army, the commendation medal, that beautiful commendation medal, because in my records it had this letter from Major General Robertson which entitled me to the -- and the orders in my file."

It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a private and the corporal tells you to pick up cigarette butts or clean the latrine, or your platoon leader, your captain tells you to shape up these men \u2014 go on bivouac, maneuvers. There\u2019s always someone above you to tell you what to do and I was waiting for someone to tell me what to do. I had this brother and sister living out in Colorado and I went to visit them. And I spent almost the entire summer there \u2014 went to the mountains, breathing some nice fresh air and just relaxing. And slowly, the time was coming to go, when I would have to go back to school \u2014 if I wanted to finish school. And I was really very reluctant to go and I think that this same thing followed me, this same feeling followed me until I gave up practice until I gave up my practice and left St. Joseph to seek my career \u2014 another career in the theater. I had the typical midlife crisis. I did go back to school because I thought let me finish one thing that I started. Let me at least do that. But I was very unhappy when I went back. Many men, many of the students in my class were much younger. They had just come out of high school or you know, they\u2019d gotten a B.A. in college and had gone on to podiatry school. And quite a few were married and I was kind of an old man at 26. And an angry old man because the world had passed me by. And I\u2019d lost four years. I really hadn\u2019t. It was the most formative four years that I could have had to prepare me for what came later and that was just \u2014 that was life. I went back to school and I came back to St. Joseph to practice. My first year back at school, though, was the hardest and I knew that I would need help. And the Veterans Administration had a counseling service at the University of Chicago and I was able to go there, on Saturdays, every week for about six weeks. And I had a very intense and intensive meeting with a very, very good psychologist, analyst, therapist, counselor that finally culminated in taking various tests. And I did. I took, but I tried, I tried as objective as I could with these tests and they grade you, you know, on the curve. Like, say in law, maybe four people will be better than you are if you follow that field but 95 won\u2019t be as good as you. And, as I said, I tried to be as objective as I could in taking the tests but the results were that I would probably be best in personnel management, law and then medicine. Medicine, of course, I\u2019d had two years of pre-med prior to going into podiatry school. So, I\u2019m sure that that showed up in the exams. And I came back and I practiced and I had a very lucrative practice for 14 years and then I had the typical midlife crisis. And I see, gee, and I kept thinking about life back in the DP camps and how tenuous it is and how it just could hang by a thin thread. And you\u2019re here today and tomorrow the whole thing could be wiped out. So live each day and, that\u2019s not knew with me, of course. But live it the way you want to live it. And live it the way it'll give you the most pleasure, not the most remuneration. But just that\u20191l make you a good man and I picked the most difficult profession in the world. And I left St. Joe and joined a melodrama troupe in Colorado, on the western slope. They called it the Kerosene (ph) Circuit. And I played Aspen, Glenwood Springs, Leadville, Durango, Steamboat Springs \u2014 did it an entire summer. And I was 42 years old then."

My father came over in the great wave of immigration, 1906. He was married, already, and had a child \u2014 my oldest brother, who will be 87 in November, next month. And he started peddling. It\u2019s the typical American story of the Jews who came over and put a pack on their back which he did, and sold needles and notions and dry goods \u2014 whatever he could carry \u2014 until he made enough money to buy a horse so that he could carry more things over into Kansas from St. Joseph, Missouri. It\u2019s on the border between the, right on the border between Kansas and Missouri. Made enough money then to buy a wagon so he could carry more goods. Then made enough money to bring Mother over and my brother and his sister. \u2019'm giving you all this background because of what has happened. When he had his family over, when he had Mother, he didn\u2019t want to go peddling anymore. He wanted to establish, to take root somewhere \u2014 in St. Joe. So he opened up a feed store. After all, there were no, there were very few cars. I once read what, what really has happened in my lifetime in the way of automobiles and radio and television and airplanes and all the computers. This has all happened, gee, in this century \u2014 not even the entire century, beginning, I remember listening to the radio on the little battery. What\u2019d they call \u2014 my brother made it. We would listen, we had earphones and I\u2019d listen on one and he\u2019d listen on the other. But then, we had the last, after the feed store and when there weren\u2019t too many more horses, Dad opened up a grocery store. In 1919, and to this day, my brother-in-law has that store. He and my oldest sister took over the store when I came home from, when my brother-in-law came home from the army. Incidentally, my brother-in-law and I were both in the same unit, until we were separated and I went into all this other work and he stayed with the 95\" Infantry Division. And every once in a while, if he has two beers, he\u2019 II let you know how he took Metts (ph) \u2014 and, and he did.

And I, during the Depression I worked \u2014 worked at the drugstore. And I was just busy \u2014 busy keeping myself going. It was rather selfish, I presume, but it was difficult being Jewish in a small town. Not as difficult as it is now. We only have about 200 souls in St. Joseph. Before the war, there were around 4500. We didn\u2019t become assimilated. We had our own synagogue, of course. We had our own fraternity, sorority \u2014 we had our own groups that we socialized with. Little by little, course we couldn\u2019t go to the St. Joseph Country Club, which is a joke that I had on them much later on when I received Alumnus of the Year from my college and the dinner was held at the St. Joseph Country Club. There were many times when I refused to go there \u2014 they couldn\u2019t allow Jews as members, they certainly didn\u2019t want us there when we were receiving any kind of honors. It\u2019s all changed now, however. But I wasn\u2019t as, I really wasn\u2019t as observant as my dad. I went to the synagogue on holidays with him and when my mother passed away I said Koddish (ph) when I could, as many times as I could. Also, I came home, there were times that I received, there was a time when I received a letter from home saying that mother was recuperating before I received a letter saying what was wrong. Mother\u2019d had, had gone to Mayo Clinic for a mastectomy in 19, 1945. And she\u2019d lived to 1954 when it had metastasized. So all this took place. You asked me if I was as observant a Jew. I, I thought God had forsaken my people. I really did. I was very angry with Him. How could you let this happen? So I was going to get even. I Just wouldn\u2019t do anything that He wanted me to do. What were the prayers? So, they were hollow. Why would He listen to mine when He didn\u2019t listen to their cries. I heard them. I don\u2019t think I really know to this day and that was reinforced because He took my wife away. He, she, the spirit, I don\u2019t know. But I do know this. Though it didn\u2019t happen to me, those who did believe, and today, those who believe with all their heart and those who believe the way my dad did, had a much easier time of it. For some reason."

            "question": "You spent the last 50 years angry? About what?",
            "answer": "I never spoke about it \u2014 I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve probably talked more now in these few hours than I have my whole lifetime, since then. Oh, there was a time in Los Angeles, when I was living there, that one of the high school teachers was rewriting history. And he said that this really didn\u2019t happen. He was teaching his classes that all these emaciated bodies were coming from Central Casting. And, course we hear these stories over and over again. And my optometrist, at the time, was a survivor \u2014 an emigre, and he was telling me about this. And I told him my involvement in the DP camps and he asked me if I would work. They were going to set up a round robin with survivors and liberators, such as myself, in a church, actually. And it was, I think it was on Wilshire Boulevard, on Pico Boulevard. There was a church that had classrooms and we were going to have a round robin about, well I have all the papers \u2014 we were going to take turns and tell our story over and over and over again. And the classrooms that were bussed in would be in this class and then they would do \u2014 they would go, each one of them, in time, would hear the story of about six of us. And incidentally, the Fonz was one of them \u2014 Henry Winkler. I think that that was the main attraction for a lot of these kids that came in because, you know, Happy Days was running on the crest of television waves. And I got involved, then, and that\u2019s, that was the change of name. I think you, I was using Joe Frederick at the time because when I went into the theater, you couldn\u2019t have a very ethnic- sounding name if you wanted to work. In fact, the first man that interviewed me for a job said that he looked at his calendar and when he saw Joe Friedman, he said, he thought to himself, he said, \u201cEh, another accountant? Another insurance salesman? I have plenty of insurance and I have my own accountant. I don\u2019t need anybody like that.\u201d And he told me this when I went in. He was the director of Love of Life and Secret Storm \u2014 these were soaps that were going on at that time, in New York. And I wanted to work. He says, \u201cYou'll never work under the name of Joe Friedman.\u201d Well, I wanted to keep the same initials. And also, a strange thing happened before I left St. Joe. One of my patients called me Frederick, by accident. She called me Dr. Frederick and I thought, gee, what a nice sounding name and it\u2019s the same initial. But I didn\u2019t have to worry about that because there was a dancer in the Equity, one of the actors\u2019 union, who was Joe Friedman, and it didn\u2019t matter to him \u2014 he was a dancer. And so I couldn\u2019t use my name, anyway. \u201cCause you can\u2019t use the same name in the union. Excuse me. So it became Joe Frederick. And that\u2019s how it was when I did this round robin. And as a result of that, we were honored at the Wilshire Boulevard Temple in Los Angeles when they were, as liberators \u2014 there were several and there all pictures here, and I was given a certificate by Vice-President Mondale. And I\u2019m very proud of that. The only other time, in Los Angeles that I spoke of it and, again, I keep referring to the pictures that I have and I left 1t with the museum \u2014 the Ludz (ph) survivors have a very strong club in Los Angeles. A very affluent club and they do wonderful work with the survivors. And they called the Federation in Los Angeles and asked for entertainers for a fundraiser that they were going to have and I was sent to go to this Beverly Hills mansion and entertain. I have a little act that I do \u2014 I was in Fiddler on the Roof for three years \u2014 I did close to 3,000 performances. I was in Las Vegas for four months with it. So I sing, and I, and I do Al Jolson. I used to go down on my knee, but then when I couldn\u2019t get up one time, I stopped that. At any rate, this Shobby Shoptie (ph) who\u2019s a terrorist from, he\u2019s one of the leading exponents of, an Israeli on terrorism. He was the main speaker and I was the entertainment. And I felt because of the occasion, and because they were all Ludz (ph) people from the, from the ghetto, that I would tell them a little bit about my experience. And I started talking and a lady came up and she threw her arms around me and she said, \u201cYou saved my life. I know who you are. I was in your camp.\u201d That\u2019s what happened. We both had a good cry. She was in my camp. She was on a truck from Koburg (ph) going down to, it was the Funk Casairn (ph) \u2014 she told me."

            "question": "Shall we take a break? We\u2019ll pick it up. End of Tape #3 Tape #4",
            "answer": "Here we have a picture of members of the Palestinian Brigade, who came into my camp, around the end of June. They had a list of members of the Palestinian Brigade who fought in North Africa and ostensibly they wanted to see if there were still relatives of members of the Brigade that were alive and living in the Displaced Person Camps and they had legitimate orders from Third Army Headquarters at Bogtoles (ph) to come into the camps and when they came into mine, I was very happy to see them. And, underneath it all, they were looking for the possibility of the sympathies of the American Jewish officers who might help out informing the links between various camps for Jewish DPs, who were coming out of the Russian Occupied Zone of Germany into the American Occupied Zone for a number of reasons that we\u2019ve already talked about. So that they could go down to Italy and get on ships for Israel. This is an aerial view of Koburg (ph). Now Koburg (ph) was a tremendous German army camp. As you can see, all the barracks were built out of brick to last forever. Unlike our camps, we built out camps out of wood and plaster, and tore them down right after the war. But Germany had theirs to go on forever. Fortunately, we had these because we knew that we were going to house the displaced persons in these camps after the war ended. So they did serve a great purpose for us. This is a wonderful Unrah (ph) team that were immeasurable help in Koburg (ph) for me and they\u2019re sort of a polygog of nationalities. The head of the Unrah (ph) team on the extreme left, the man, the balding man, was royalty. He was related to the royals of Belgium. And the one kneeling in front of him was White Russian. And she was married to an official of Macy\u2019s in New York and felt that during the time that they escaped from Russia, people helped her family and this was the only way that she could pay back in kind and she joined this Unrah (ph) team \u2014 spoke excellent Russian. In fact, she spoke about five different languages. The other members \u2014 there were two doctors, two nutritionists, a nutritionist for the entire camp, a nutritionist for the hospital, a nurse and chauffeurs. And they worked day and night, right along with us, and God bless them. This is a typical truck that, carrying the displaced persons from Koburg (ph) to Lichtenfelds (ph) which 1s a railhead, and, as you know, it was a happy time for them until they later learned what their fate held in store after they got to Russia or to Poland. But nevertheless, they decorated the trucks with leaves and trees and branches and also with pictures of their leaders. I don\u2019t know where those pictures came from \u2014 they just appeared out of nowhere and were on the trucks. And we saw to it that they plenty of food and clothing and sent families back together, quite unlike other trucks that carried out people to crematoria. This is a photo of Russians and American soldiers, at, at a checkpoint. They were there to see that things were carried out according to our own United States directives and the Russian directives. At first, they were very, rather shy, the Russians, and not as talkative as our American officers, but later on there was quite a symbiotic relationship that developed between the two. We wanted things from them and they wanted things from us. And between the two forces we got quite a bit done. Well, that happens to be a picture of me, in my Mercedes. That was a 1936 Mercedes convertible, I think they called it a cabrolay (ph). And I got it quite legitimately \u2014 we paid for it \u2014 the Germans couldn\u2019t use a lot of their vehicles because they couldn\u2019t get gasoline for it. In order for me to be able to draw gasoline and to have it serviced at the motor pool, I had to have it painted OD, and had to put the army emblem on it, a white star on it, and I put some fictitious ordinance number on the hood of the car. So there you have it, I\u2019m, if the authorities find out at this late date, I'll probably have to go to jail. This obviously is a wedding that was held in Bamburg (ph). I was in Koburg (ph) at the time, and they invited me to come up to Bamburg (ph), because they were people that I had worked with when I was in the camp at Bamburg (ph). The groom is Sergeant Richard Lane and the bride, her name 1s Hettie. I don\u2019t know her last name but she was Estonian and she had been a dental assistant and very bright. Her matron of honor was also from the, from one of the Baltic countries. And then, I\u2019m, you can see part of my head behind her. We were all in the wedding party and it was nice. It was nice to know that life could go on and that some of the institutions that we revered throughout life could take place under these most extreme circumstances. As a footnote to this, many, many years later, I visited Hettie and Bob in San Francisco. They had both gone back to college and were very, very happy. A happily married couple. This was an entertainment hall that we had in camp. They had their own musicians. They did requisition musical instruments and I have a whole roster here of what they requisitioned: guitars and violins, accordions \u2014 they all played accordions and the Bolla Lika (ph). I really thought that before it was all over with, I'd be an expert at doing the, the Kuzotzka (ph) or the polka. One of the other, or both. But, I enjoyed going to these concerts and they enjoyed having us there because they realized that we were interested in the cultural aspect of their life as well as the necessities, the other necessities of life such as eating, clothing and a roof over their heads. This was a bonus for them. Here I am again. Periodically, of course, I inspected the camp and would see to it that they had enough in the warehouses. We were always, always after enough wood so that we could heat the cauldrons that made the soup which was the mainstay of all the DPs in the camps. We would cut down entire forests in order to get enough wood and here\u2019s an example of how we would stockpile it and store it and just, it was as valuable as gold to us. As we spoke of this before, the camp was run the same way an entire city would be run. And this is the hospital of the camp. Many of the doctors, I should say that the majority of the doctors, were Polish although they, we would, they would answer to American medical, members in the medical corps of the American army. And they received wonderful treatment. Whatever they requisitioned for the hospitals we were able to get. We would either get it from our own medical supply or we would get it from the German medical supplies but whatever had to be done was done. Well this is a Polish doctor. He was a very fine man. I had occasion to talk him on a few, a few times that I went over to the hospital and of course many of the times when he came into my office to request medical supplies. But he was dedicated and very happy to be able to be a surgeon, to be a doctor again, which he couldn\u2019t do under the German thumb."

            "answer": "No I don\u2019t. No, I don\u2019t. I probably have it somewhere, on a requisition. I\u2019d have to go through the papers. I\u2019m certain that there\u2019s a name on the requisitions. I have, I have a whole list of all the Polish personnel and also I have the emblem that they wore on their jackets that I\u2019m gong to give to the museum. This is an interesting story. This gentleman had been a collaborationist. Not in the sense that he collaborated with the Germans, although he might have, but we do know that whatever organization took over the various DP camps, if he had been a member of the camp, he was able to ingratiate himself into the hierarchy of the camp to the extent where he was able to get supplies and whatever the camps needed. But he would also service himself by doing this. He probably worked the black market in cigarettes, in candy, in clothing, in liquor and the DPs knew about him. When I became commander of the camp in Koburg (ph), he started this same thing with me. And I was quite ignorant of what had gone before, and very innocent and he brought a beautiful dagger that he gave to me that he had sort of confiscated, I guess, himself and had belonged at one time to the Forestmeister of the Black Forest, near TreeAir (ph), Germany. I still have that dagger but this gentleman is no longer with us because the night of the day that he gave me this souvenir, he was murdered by other members of the camp. Conclusion of Interview"
