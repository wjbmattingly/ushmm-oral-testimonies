    "header": "something about the problem of ( ) but not in any great details. And were really quite taken aback with information that they gave to us. And then he, and at that time it wa s suggested that it might be a good idea for us not to go to the Olympics. Because of all this, these problems that sort of register our ob jections and sort of boycotting the Olympics. And we were quite taken aback about that thought. They tried to explain to us that we would never regret if we did take that action, to boycott the Olympics and they suggested that we talk it over and let them know what, what our thoughts were, if we wanted any further discussion. And we, Norman Carnis an d I went back and talked it over and thought we had discussed it wi th our parents as we had great respect for their judgment. And after talking it over with ou r parents, they also called Rabbi Levy to see what his thoughts were again. To get an explanation from him. And my father told me that he was satisfied and had confidence in Rabbi Levy\u2122s judgment and that we wouldn\u2122t regret it if we did boycott the Olympics. Of course the problem was, not the problem but the question was we, you know how i mminent our selection onto the Olympic team would be. And I held the world\u2122s record in the high hurdles and also the HarvardYale record in the broad jump. And at that time and the Harvard-Yale broad jump event which I held the record in was over 24 feet, 11 inches. And I had been running in three events at that track meet and the coach said not to take too many jumps because I had to save myself for the other events. And on the first try on the broad jump I had fouled the take off, stepped over the mark. And he said to be very careful on the next jump because he didn\u2122t want me to take all my full jumps. So on the next jump I was very careful and took off about a foot behind the take off board and I did 24 feet 11, so I was close to 26 feet in the actual jump. And they thought that I could, had a good chance of qualifying for the Olympics in the long jump. Where I had the potential to go close to 26 feet. And in the high hurdles, which was the other event that I was, had qualified for, I had been runnin g around 14, 9, 15 seconds in the high hurdles and the qualifying ti mes were in the 14 second, probably 14, 2, or 3, but I was improving in the high hurdles and I practiced timing event, timing in the high hurdle practice rounds and I was getting closer to the 14, 5, 14, 4. And they felt that there was a good chance that I could make the team in maybe two events. But at any rate, after the discussion with Rabbi Levy and my parents and this whole situation about boycotting, both Carnis and I decided that we would boycott the Olympics and we didn\u2122t go into the finial tryouts. And although I was disappointed I fe lt that that was the thing to do and that\u2122s what basically happened, as far as boycotting the Olympics [were] concerned because that time I was a senior at Harvard and I was interested in getting into busi ness and whether to go into business right away, after graduation which was in 1936 or to go to graduate school. And now I decided to go to Harvard Business School and then go into the real estate business. So I was interested in looking, I was always interested in athletics. And I knew that I was a pretty good athlete and as I say I was captain of all the track teams since I was in grammar school. But my focus after getting out of college was not, had nothing to do really with athletics, although I was interest ed in all athletics and tennis and skiing and all the other activities. But I decided to go to the Harvard Business School and then to go into business in the real estate business. And that\u2122s what happened and I was interested in, you know, finding a nice gal and getting married too. So that\u2122s the basic course that I followed. And after I got out of the business school I participated in tennis. And I was ranked number six in New England in the super senior category so I was always intere sted in athletics but that\u2122s really the basic story about what happened in the situation. ",

But I participated in the Senior Olympics in 1983 in Florida. Florida Senior Olympics and I won ten medals at that but that was not the real Olympics, that was the Senior Olympics. So I, you know I\u2122ve won medals in Olympic senior competition."

Do you think that sports can be separate from politics or that they\u2122re just inextricably linked in situations like that?",
            "answer": "Well I think sports can be separa ted from politics. In a way they should be but it depends on what th e separation is. I mean interference by the government, particularly in sports, I wouldn\u2122t like to see that but this is a, the boycotting is diffe rent, I don\u2122t consider that a mixing of sports and politics or a separation. I mean I think that\u2122s a moral ground and I just think that they sh ould have been boycotted; the U.S. should have boycotted it, not because it\u2122s \u0152 there\u2122s separation of those activities. But I just think they should have just the way they did in the Russian Olympics."

            "answer": "Well I remember after the Harvard/ Yale track meet, which Carnis and I won six gold medals there was quite a bit of publicity in the newspapers and there was a picture of Carnis and myself in the sport page. I forget which paper it was, and saying how we\u2122d won six gold medals and I think they called us Damon and Pythias because we were such good friends. About three or four days after the track meet, I got a phone call. I forget what the fellow\u2122s name was but he said he was calling at the request of Rabbi Levy. And he was on the men\u2122s council of the Temple and he had read about what we did at the Harvard/Yale track meet. And that he understood we were contenders for the Olympics and he had some important information that he\u2122d like to talk to us about at the request of Rabbi Levy and as I had mentioned, Rabbi Levy was the head of Temple Israel in Boston, a Reform Temple, and he was wellrespected all over the United States. And I was confirmed at Temple Israel and naturally when they asked us to come, or asked me and Norman Carnis, we agreed to come and I think it was set for two or three days later."

Except that something about the Olympics and we went to the boardroom at the Temple Israel on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, that\u2122s where the Temple was at that time. And we went there and they explained about the reason they wanted to talk to us was in connection with what was going on in Germany. And they explained the problems that were going on there with the Nazis and the terrible things that were happening to the Jews there and I don\u2122t remember the exact details of exactly what items they were talking about but it was a terrible picture as I remember it and they discussed it fully and we told th em that, I told them that I was preparing to go to the final tryouts. And that I\u2122d qualified and had to get prepared for it and train again and they explained to me that again it was a terrible situation there in Germany and they suggested that they thought it would be a very good idea to boycott the Olympics and they were quite sure that I\u2122d neve r regret it. Even though I had my heard set on being in the Olympics and they suggested that you know it was up to me and Carnis decided what we wanted to do and so I told them that we\u2122d talk it over and let them know what we wanted to do and that was the basic situation as far as that meeting is concerned."

And I went home and talked it over with them and as I explained, my father called Rabbi Levy to find out if I had the right report. And after his discussion with Rabbi Levy, he felt that the rabbi had a complete understanding of the whole si tuation and he could rely on his judgment and that I should rely on his judgment and he said that you know left it up to me but he strongly recommended that I go along with the suggestion from the rabbi and the men\u2122s committee. I think the head of the Men\u2122s committee I think it was a fellow named Kimler or something close to it, or Kimmel or Kemla, it\u2122s some name like that."

I\u2122m pretty sure I could have done it in the long jump, I\u2122m not that certain about the high hurdles.
