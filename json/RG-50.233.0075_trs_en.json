            "answer": "My father\u2019s name is Joseph Valman, April 19, 1913. My mother is Fanny Fooks and she was born August 28, 1910. They married in Paris after they finished school and they were looking for a place to practice medicine because both of them were poor. They chose a village in the north of France. When they arrived there, it was 1935 and there was something in the air. They felt that it was not very safe to announce they were Jews."

            "answer": "No, I think they were ---. Well, my mother especially had been in Russia in Shetow during the revolution. Her parents were wealthy merchants and when the revolution, they had to run abandoning property, several property in Shetow. Just run with my grandmother\u2019s jewelry. I think she felt from that time a lot of fear and was extremely suspicious of people. I assume that when she started hearing about what was going on in Germany, that she started to fear that 1t might spread and kept being Jewish a secret. She was not religious. To her I think, being Jewish didn\u2019t mean very much. I have no idea what my father thought. But I know that they did not have any record that we were Jews. When I was born in \u00b037, the priest, I think they told the priest -- he gave us a full certificate of baptism. I went to church from the time I went to school, I think. From the age of five or so until at least ---, throughout the whole war and maybe after. I don\u2019t think they ever really thought about being Jews."

Because -- I don\u2019t know. I suspect I may have had some notion but I don\u2019t know that it meant very much to me, what being a Jew is except it\u2019s dangerous. But that -- yeah, I went to church. I went to Catholic church and that was my religion. That\u2019s what the God I believed in there. That\u2019s how I grew up."

            "answer": "Oh, yes. Oh yes, because the Germans lived with us in our village. We were occupied. I have a memo here of singing Oh Tannenbaum to the Germans. The first thing they did when they came to the village -- we lived in a sort of -- we had a big house, big ,made of brick. It was attached to another house, similar, to the left. So we were -- we had those two houses touching each other. In the house to the left, lived an old lady. I think after a while, the Germans took her house and made her go away. I don\u2019t know where. I remember she had a garden with flowers and we had a vegetable garden, not much flowers. She had all flowers. So that I was close to the Germans, of course, because they were in the same yard. I mean we shared the yard. There was no wall. I remember my mother telling me not to eat the candies they gave me because they might be poisoned. Of course, to me it didn\u2019t make much sense. I guess, none of it made very much sense. I don\u2019t remember being afraid especially of the Germans -- I remember the uniforms. Eventually, they also took our house. They threw us out of the house and made us --. So we moved in with an old -- with a widow who had a big house. We spent, I don\u2019t know how long -- but until the war was over."

Nobody ever lacked food because we were a village and there were cows, there were chickens, there was everything you\u2019d need for basics. But we didn\u2019t have wool, we didn\u2019t have shoes and I remember one time an American soldier in a parachute fell down. He was caught in the trees and he died. People in the village got the parachute and I think I saw it because I remember blood on the white silk. My mother gathered the thread and she had someone knit me a sweater and it was horrible. I hated that sweater with a vengeance. I remember one day somebody brought us oranges. I don\u2019t know where they came from. I had never seen an orange before and sardines. Also I remember when the Americans came to liberate us, we -- they threw us chewing gum to the kids. They chewed the same piece, I think, for weeks because it was a novelty."

Of course my education in there was not excellent and my mother was worried that I couldn\u2019t stay there if I wanted -- if I was going to college. But this is not the true reason because I could have gone to which was close and spent a week there and come back home for the weekends. The real reason was that my mother really disliked the village very much. She felt lost in it. She came -- she didn\u2019t like the people. She didn\u2019t like to practice medicine and --."

So that one morning, I was woken up by my grandmother who shook me and said quick, quick, we have to run. She grabbed me by the hand and we went and hid in the outside with the chicken. The Germans had come. I don\u2019t know -- I have very few memories of it -- what I felt. I don\u2019t know if I knew that they had come to everybody or was only my family, thought they had come just for us. But as we were running, my grandmother and I were hidden but the Germans saw us and they shot towards us but didn\u2019t wound anybody. My mother stayed in the house with the papers. I think she was trying to hide papers. My father and grandfather run away towards the woods to meet the other men. The Germans shot towards them too but missed. So that no one run away. They came back. The lady who lived in the house just stood there. I remember she stood there outside and she was screaming. After that they took us and they put us in front of the Marie and the women were -- they separated men, women and children who were with a teacher. They were going to take us all to Germany in trucks. But apparently the priest talked them out of it."

            "answer": "Oh, yes. To me, it feels -- it is heartbreaking. I have never been to Israel but it\u2019s heartbreaking that they are now killing. They were sometimes killing children. There 1s a good deal of brutality -- that the people in the Middle East were -- lost their land. Yet, on the other hand, where are the Jews to go? They need their country. They need a place. We need a place in case something happens, we need a home. So how this is going to end, I don\u2019t know but it\u2019s ---. ?\u2019'm afraid it will end very badly for Israel. I don\u2019t know, to me it feels like it\u2019s something that I cannot avoid. It\u2019s where I was born, who I am. Maybe just wisdom that you\u2019re better off just being more what you are rather than fighting it. As I get older. It\u2019s not a terrible source of comfort to me unfortunately, but there are no others that I know, that would be any better."
