            "answer": "My father\u2019s name is Joseph Valman, April 19, 1913. My mother is Fanny Fooks and she was born August 28, 1910. They married in Paris after they finished school and they were looking for a place to practice medicine because both of them were poor. They chose a village in the north of France. When they arrived there, it was 1935 and there was something in the air. They felt that it was not very safe to announce they were Jews."

            "answer": "No, I think they were ---. Well, my mother especially had been in Russia in Shetow during the revolution. Her parents were wealthy merchants and when the revolution, they had to run abandoning property, several property in Shetow. Just run with my grandmother\u2019s jewelry. I think she felt from that time a lot of fear and was extremely suspicious of people. I assume that when she started hearing about what was going on in Germany, that she started to fear that 1t might spread and kept being Jewish a secret. She was not religious. To her I think, being Jewish didn\u2019t mean very much. I have no idea what my father thought. But I know that they did not have any record that we were Jews. When I was born in \u00b037, the priest, I think they told the priest -- he gave us a full certificate of baptism. I went to church from the time I went to school, I think. From the age of five or so until at least ---, throughout the whole war and maybe after. I don\u2019t think they ever really thought about being Jews."

Because -- I don\u2019t know. I suspect I may have had some notion but I don\u2019t know that it meant very much to me, what being a Jew is except it\u2019s dangerous. But that -- yeah, I went to church. I went to Catholic church and that was my religion. That\u2019s what the God I believed in there. That\u2019s how I grew up."

            "answer": "Oh, yes. Oh yes, because the Germans lived with us in our village. We were occupied. I have a memo here of singing Oh Tannenbaum to the Germans. The first thing they did when they came to the village -- we lived in a sort of -- we had a big house, big ,made of brick. It was attached to another house, similar, to the left. So we were -- we had those two houses touching each other. In the house to the left, lived an old lady. I think after a while, the Germans took her house and made her go away. I don\u2019t know where. I remember she had a garden with flowers and we had a vegetable garden, not much flowers. She had all flowers. So that I was close to the Germans, of course, because they were in the same yard. I mean we shared the yard. There was no wall. I remember my mother telling me not to eat the candies they gave me because they might be poisoned. Of course, to me it didn\u2019t make much sense. I guess, none of it made very much sense. I don\u2019t remember being afraid especially of the Germans -- I remember the uniforms. Eventually, they also took our house. They threw us out of the house and made us --. So we moved in with an old -- with a widow who had a big house. We spent, I don\u2019t know how long -- but until the war was over."

Nobody ever lacked food because we were a village and there were cows, there were chickens, there was everything you\u2019d need for basics. But we didn\u2019t have wool, we didn\u2019t have shoes and I remember one time an American soldier in a parachute fell down. He was caught in the trees and he died. People in the village got the parachute and I think I saw it because I remember blood on the white silk. My mother gathered the thread and she had someone knit me a sweater and it was horrible. I hated that sweater with a vengeance. I remember one day somebody brought us oranges. I don\u2019t know where they came from. I had never seen an orange before and sardines. Also I remember when the Americans came to liberate us, we -- they threw us chewing gum to the kids. They chewed the same piece, I think, for weeks because it was a novelty."

Of course my education in there was not excellent and my mother was worried that I couldn\u2019t stay there if I wanted -- if I was going to college. But this is not the true reason because I could have gone to which was close and spent a week there and come back home for the weekends.

The Germans had come. I don\u2019t know -- I have very few memories of it -- what I felt. I don\u2019t know if I knew that they had come to everybody or was only my family, thought they had come just for us. But as we were running, my grandmother and I were hidden but the Germans saw us and they shot towards us but didn\u2019t wound anybody. My mother stayed in the house with the papers. I think she was trying to hide papers. My father and grandfather run away towards the woods to meet the other men. The Germans shot towards them too but missed. So that no one run away. They came back. The lady who lived in the house just stood there. I remember she stood there outside and she was screaming. After that they took us and they put us in front of the Marie and the women were -- they separated men, women and children who were with a teacher. They were going to take us all to Germany in trucks. But apparently the priest talked them out of it.  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But then there was Jesus who loved little children and took care of all of us. All we needed to do was to be good. That was simple enough and Jesus was very forging and understanding. There was the Virgin Mary and it was a statue and she was so beautiful and she was wearing this blue cape and her hands were around, with such a sweet expression, that I was very attached to that aspect of the church.

I was looking at this rabbi who was short and had a beard and kept moving back and forth and kept talking and talking and talking and talking and . Then the women in my days, were nothing. The wife of the rabbi was shaved. She had no hair. I knew she had no hair but she was wearing a wig. So I never saw what she looked like without her wig but it felt to me like it was a terrible thing.

            "answer": "We lived in Cambridge for six years. My husband was going to Harvard and I went to B.U. and got a degree. Then we came over here. We had two small children then. He came to an age during the Vietnam War so he wouldn\u2019t be drafted. Then we divorced in \u201978. I stayed for many reasons. The main reason was not to separate the children from their father and not to break their life completely apart by starting not only with another father. We stayed close -- we always stayed close. With another father, a new country and a new language, I thought it\u2019s bad enough for kids. So we had an agreement who would stay around and we did. We remained put until last year. Last year, my ex-husband moved to Atlanta. I stayed around in Washington. I started a private practice after I divorced which was not ---. As I grow older, I feel more and more Jewish. My daughter considers herself Jewish. My son, not. She\u2019s working in Tucson with Russian refugees. You know, the Jewish refugees. She\u2019s learned to speak Russian on her own. My son --. So she does pretty much the work of a social worker or a psychologist, a mother. My son has studied industrial psychology. He\u2019s now working with a firm with -- in the area of handicapped but in a -- how big firms deal with handicapped people -- with sexual harassment. I guess I am still struggling with where I belong but it seems like more and more I feel that I -- I feel a Jewish identity but not religion .I am less and less a believer. I don\u2019t think I believe in God any more. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t believe in Christ any more which makes me sad but he was too much of a childhood. It\u2019s like a fairy tale now. It\u2019s a man, not a boy but it\u2019s a fairy tale and one day we have to give him up."

There 1s a good deal of brutality -- that the people in the Middle East were -- lost their land. Yet, on the other hand, where are the Jews to go? They need their country. They need a place. We need a place in case something happens, we need a home. So how this is going to end, I don\u2019t know but it\u2019s ---. ?\u2019'm  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.
