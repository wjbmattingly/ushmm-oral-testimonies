I remember we slept in the living room on a bed that closed up, you know, because she couldn\u2019t keep it open, then the kids wouldn\u2019t have where to play. But it was very nice. I mean, you know, she was just wonderful, she was just wonderful. And, you know, I wanted to go to school but I saw that I had to go and provide for myself. You know, you couldn\u2019t help seeing it. So, I went to school at night and I went to look -- actually, I Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Helen Goldkind ot February 21, 2001 think what really saved me from not mourning there forever is because I knew I have to get out and get a job. And so I tried getting a job, and you know, I wasn\u2019t trained for anything, and I -- I -- although I-I-I was learning how to speak English for n -- for close to a year, but still -- I understood most of it but I couldn\u2019t speak it too well. So there are so many drawbacks for me to get a job. Well, 1t took me about two, three weeks going every day. My brother-in-law, he would take me and paid for my carfare, for my token because I had no money. And I was going around and he helped me, he came with me at times, and they were telling me they would love to hire me, but I\u2019m not trained for anything. And of course, you know, when I came from Sweden [ didn\u2019t have money to buy clothes, so I was walking around with this big -- these big sweaters and these heavy pants. You know, I didn\u2019t really look that presentable, either. So one day I -- there was a big place, a fur place, and my brother-in-law took me up there to ask for a job and I went over to the boss and I asked for a job and he looked at me, and I told him my problem and he was very sympathetic, but he says to me, I wish I would, but I don\u2019t know where to put you because you do -- y-you don\u2019t know what to do. I mean you -- where -- wa -- how - I says, I\u2019m going to do anything you want me to do, just -- just please give me a job. He looked around and sadly said, I\u2019m sorry. So, I wanted to see how this factory looks like because I heard so much about it and how it works and all that. So from the office I sneaked into the factory. I opened the door and I see that\u2019s the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Helen Goldkind \u201c February 21, 2001 factory. So I walk in there just to see the factory and while I was passing, I saw there an old man standing and he had a beard and he wasn\u2019t working, he was just standing, looking around. And I said to mys -- you know, in my -- my grandfather came in front of me, he had a black hat like my grandfather ha-had, but he was a little shorter than my grandfather, my grandfather was very tall. So I walked over to him and I -- I felt that I can speak Yiddish to him and I did. And I told him my story. I-I says, you know, y -- I don\u2019t know if you know the tragedy on what has happened to the Jews in Europe, but I survived with my sister and I came out here, and I have a sister, but I -- I can see she cannot feed me or take care of me, I\u2019m forced to get a job and I don\u2019t know what to do. And the man listened and listened and listened. And then he says to me, wait a minute. So I said to myself, why not? I'll wait. I have no place to go and no -- nothing to do. Pll wait at -- and a -- I -- I -- I was watching where he was going and I saw him go to the same man that just told me that he doesn\u2019t have a job for me and I thought I was going to faint. And he was standing there and standing there with this man, and standing there and talking to him. And then he finally comes back and he says to me, come back tomorrow. I says, tomorrow? What time? He said nine o\u2019clock. When I came back, I stayed near the door, eight o\u2019clock I was already there waiting the door -- for the door to be opened. And finally I went in there, into the office. Shall I continue? A -- so anyway, I went to the office, they took one look at me and as I said, I didn\u2019t look Interview with Helen Goldkind \u201d February 21, 2001 so presentable. It was a problem. And he must have promised his father, that was the son of this old man, he was the boss and I didn\u2019t know at that time. So this man wouldn\u2019t leave the son until he would promise him he\u2019ll give me some kind of a job. So they looked at me and they had -- it was a very big place and they had their own designers and were so many secretaries in this office. So the de -- I don\u2019t know, I think she was one of the designers, or whatever. She takes one look at me and she says to me, you never go shopping. I's -- wi -- I said to her, you know, there is a problem, I don\u2019t have no money. She takes another look at me, she says, well don\u2019t worry about it, we'll -- we\u2019ll bill it to the -- to the company. So I had no choice, I go with her and this lady, I tell you, she knew exactly what to do. She knew exactly what to do with me. She -- she took me in. I remember they were smaller stores. Now that I know there\u2019s -- was Macy\u2019s and everything, but she didn\u2019t want to waste time. So she took me into these smaller stores and took out different dresses. And every time she brought a dress for me to put on -- first of all, I -- you know, I didn't have a bra, I didn\u2019t have anything. Sh -- so she got me a little bra and stockings, she put stockings on me, I never had stockings in my life. And she -- we -- we bought a pair of shoes with a little heel, I think it was an inch and a half, or -- and she tells me I should get dressed and then she brings these dresses. I says, you know, they\u2019re so expensive, I -- you know, and I don\u2019t have any money. She says, don\u2019t worry about it, just put it on. So I put it on and I tell Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Helen Goldkind * February 21, 2001 you, I looked like a different person. You know, I just looked like a different person. Then she went and took my -- my hair was raw, you know. She took my hair and put it in a bun, and then she put a little lipstick on me. And she bought a lot of clothes that I wasn\u2019t paying much attention because it was scaring me. And we went back and we got into the office and -- and I tell you, I did look different, I must say. And so the boss came in and he took a look in the office because he was in the main place, you know, watching the workers. And I saw him looked at -- looking at me twice, like to say well, is that the same girl? So, anyway, then they gave me a job. They had a vy -- like a [indecipherable] house, where very rich ladies came in to pick out skins for their coats. I didn\u2019t realize how rich these women were at that time. And they were training me on what to say to them and how to deal with them and in no time I was so anxious to hold this job that -- and then I-I didn\u2019t mind staying after the time, or I never went down for lunch. I would- my sister would give me a Jell-o sandwich, I would quickly eat it right there, and I was trying my best they should keep me there. And after awhile -- after awhile they saw how -- I became a good thing for them, too. You know, they paid me, they paid me well and I became a good thing for them too, because whatever they needed, or -- they could do with me. And then had models when -- whenever a buyer would come from a different city, they would call a -- a model, or a few models, matter of fact, and they came in, it was a very big place. So one time I Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Helen Goldkind * February 21, 2001 became lucky and a model didn\u2019t show up, and you know, that lady, she says, well, why don\u2019t we call in Helen? So they called Helen in and I came there and they said to me, listen, put on this coat and take a walk. You know, on a walk. I put on the coat and I took a walk, and you know, I was younger, taller, I tell you. A- Anyway, I took a walk and this buyer said to me, take another walk. I smiled at him and I took another walk. And it went well, you know, it went well. So finally that lady said to the boss, let\u2019s send her to modeling school. So -- so they send me to modeling school for a few hours, but I still had to come into work to get my paycheck. After a few weeks, what happened was they told me the same thing, yen- you know, put your chest out, you know, lift your head, walk graciously. You know, how many times do you need to be told what to do? So I walked over to her, I says, listen, I don\u2019t mind going there, but it seems to me like I know everything already what to do. And I did it, you know, I sort of did it -- evidently a good job because then, when a buyer would come in, they would ask, is Helen going to be there? Somebody tipped me off that a -- a buyer was asking about me, then I felt already secure with the job. Then I felt so happy. I was so happy, you have no idea. Anyway, I wound up with a beautiful job and people were very nice to me and they paid me a lot, I thought at that time, they paid me a lot. I think I was getting 75 dollar a -- a week. You see, and what happened was, they paid these models by the Interview with Helen Goldkind * February 21, 2001 hour. And here I\u2019m willing to anything they want me to do for 75 dollars a week. But they paid me overtime if would come in on Saturday. And I ju --"

That was the first time we went out into this world where we saw people living normally, sort of. The youngsters, anyway. So we stood there for awhile. In the meanti -- but you had to take your coats off in order -- you know, and check it in. So we took our coats off and we checked in the coats and 1 -- you know, we were standing there and a few guys came and asked these other girls to dance. But somehow nobody asked me to dance. So anyway, I stayed there and two young man walked over and they talked to me and they saw I have an accent and they -- their par -- ha -- their parents were Hungarians, and they knew a few words Hungarian, so they were -- sure enough they were having a good time. And me being so depressed, I was looking at them, I says, why are they so happy? What is to -- so funny? You know, saying a word in Hungarian, I looked at them like they\u2019re a -- you know, I didn\u2019t understand them. I didn\u2019t understand that they\u2019re Interview with Helen Goldkind 7 February 21, 2001 just normal, happy young man. So they stood with me for awhile, but then they walked away again. And I was waiting there for awhile, waiting for these girls to come back, so a man with a girl comes over to me and he says, would you like to dance? I says to him, no, I don\u2019t dance. So he detected a -- an accent and he looked at me again and he wondered why I been standing there alone and I\u2019m not dancing, what are you doing here? So he says, look, would you like to have a drink? I says, no, I don\u2019t drink. I was -- I was thinking, you know, I\u2019m waiting for the girls. I don\u2019t want to -- you know, start in with anything. So this girl that he came with had to say goodbye because she had to go home. In the meantime, this -- this young man is not leaving, a-a-and so he says to me, like he -- he -- then he got like, would you like to -- would you like a Coke? I says n -- well, I don\u2019t know if I can go and have a Coke because I\u2019m waiting for my friends and they\u2019re supposed to come soon and we\u2019re gonna go home. So I says -- so he says, well come, we\u2019ll just get a Coke and we\u2019ll come right back. So that\u2019s what happened. In the meantime, I had to tell him who I was, that I\u2019m a survivor and I just came from where -- well, then I became an object to him, that he wanted to know what happened because he -- I was the first survivor that he came -- he came in contact with. Well, I want to tell you something, he started asking me questions and every question he gave me, it just -- I wanted to really hit him, because -- and he didn\u2019t realize what he was questioning. And then he -- he -- so I told him, you know, you\u2019 re talking to me like Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Helen Goldkind \u201d February 21, 2001 it\u2019s -- like you\u2019re cross examining me. He says, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. I just want to know what happened there, do you understand? And I wasn\u2019t ready to talk. And the more I resisted not talking, the more he wanted to know. So our meet -- first meeting didn\u2019t go too well. He -- he -- and like, you know, he -- he would ask me - he -- he really didn\u2019t mean to hurt me or anything, but he didn\u2019t know how to deal with me. So he says to me, you know, I read in the papers that they were taking young women for the Germans. I says, y-you heard right, but they were taking -- what happened was whenever they -- they took the Czech girls, they picked them up from the street if they saw a Czech girl, a Polish girl, they did use them for the - for the arm -- for the army, but the Jews were picked to be killed, not you know, taking them there. At -- so I -- I said to myself, a lot of Jewish girls probably would feel lucky if they -- you know, just to survive -- to -- to -- to be able to do that. Anyway -- but it was very, you know, it wasn\u2019t -- 1t wasn\u2019t good. So then he finally says to me, listen, I want to take you home. I says no, you\u2019re not taking me home, cause I\u2019m going to go home with the five of these girls. So the girls finally came. I- | think hey kept on staying there because he wanted to pull out words from me, you see, because I wasn\u2019t ready to talk. I couldn\u2019t talk. And finally the girls came and you know, we are finished having a good time and we says, let\u2019s go home. So he says to the girls, listen, I want to take you all home. So the girls says yeah, take me home. We were five of them. So I was between them, so -- he had a car. He had Interview with Helen Goldkind \u201d February 21, 2001 a car. Matter of fact, he had a new car, a -- a Buick. So he sa -- we -- he took us home and finally he dropped them all off and my sister and I were the last one and he still wanted to talk and the guy says no, no, I have to go, you know, we\u2019re late, my sister is going to worry, we\u2019re supposed to be home. So I -- I -- he says to me, I'll come and see you tomorrow. I says -- I heard him say it, but I didn\u2019t even answer him, I just wanted to go in, because I was annoyed with him, the way he talked. So finally we went in and my sister says, you know, I worried -- and then my sister told us not to go into a car and we came in a car and we didn\u2019t want to lie to her. So we -- we told her what happened and nec -- next day I was washing the kitchen floor and I forgot about him, because I wasn\u2019t too nice to him. A-And the bell rings, and -- see, we didn\u2019t have a telephone in the apartment, a telephone was downstairs and if there was a telephone for us, you know, somebody picked it up and rang our bell. And my sister was busy with the kids and I was washing the floors. But -- so my sister says, Helen, run down and see who\u2019s on the telephone. So I run down there barefooted, you know, because I was washing the kitchen on my hands and knees. And I see this man standing there, I said to myself, what happened here? Well, I did -- he did tell -- say that he\u2019s gonna come back, but I just wasn\u2019t paying any attention, my mind was so preoccupied with other things. So he came back and he wants to go upstairs. I says look, I\u2019m in the middle of washing the kitchen floor. I-It\u2019s very busy there, my sister is busy with the kids, I don\u2019t Interview with Helen Goldkind \" February 21, 2001 think you can come upstairs. So he says, I'll tell you what, [Il wait in the hallway until you finish washing the floor. So he comes up and he stays in the hallway and my sister says, who 1s he? So I says, you know, this is the guy that [indecipherable] yesterday. I told him that he can\u2019t come because we\u2019re busy here, but he said -- he chose to stay in the hallway, so he\u2019s in the hallway. So my sister was very nice, you know, she was normal, you know, she wasn\u2019t like me, you know. So she walked out and she says, who are you, what are you? So he was very good friends with the family of the Bestform. The -- their name was Benenfeld. You see, he la -- he lan to the yeshiva with the Benenfeld\u2019s son-in-law. They had one daughter and that son-in-law was a nephew of the geera rabba. So today geera rabba don\u2019t mean anything, but in Europe it was a big situation. And my sister knew the Benenfelds, so she says -- so she felt a little embarrassed, she says, well as soon as she finishes washing the kitchen, come on in. Because the kitchen wasn\u2019t that big, the apartment wasn\u2019t that big. So he came in and he talked, and my sister talked to him, you know, my sister talked to him. At that time -- at that point he wasn\u2019t no longer a stranger, but he -- sh -- he made connections with my sister, actually. And he stood there, he says he\u2019s got to go to Richmond, he was from Richmond. He told me the truth, he had a place in Richmond, but then he -- he -- e-everything he said he told the truth, but it didn't connect with me.

And there was a lady and -- with two children a-and I really didn\u2019t know who she was, because people were coming and going and then after I had my say to the kids, this lady came up and she said to me, you know, I\u2019m an SS man\u2019s daughter, and well, he didn\u2019t tell me that it was so bad. And imagine, I didn\u2019t even scratch the surface when I was talking to these little kids. She had two beautiful little girls with her and -- and she said that to me and it\u2019s like she would hit me over the head. And I said to her -- I didn\u2019t have time to debate it with her how good or bad it was, so I pulled her aside and I say to her, listen, I\u2019m so glad that you came in here, because I need to ask you some questions. Tell me, did your father tell you what his job was as an SS man? We didn\u2019t talk about it. So I says, you know, in Auschwitz, where I was, there came a million and a half children to Auschwitz. And you know what the -- the SS people, they had their families there with their children, you know what their job was? Did you ever wonder what their job was? She says no. Watching over the people she says to me. I says, not really. Their job was to take little kids Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Helen Goldkind \u201d\" February 21, 2001 like yours -- I pointed my finger to her children -- to the gas chamber. These kids had no -- nobody had any mercy over them and they knew where these kids are going. And they were living there very happily with their own families. So I -- I -- I don\u2019t know how more to explain it to you, how good and bad it was. You know, she started crying. I think I scared her a little bit because I showed my f -- pointed my fingers to her children. So I said to myself, you know, I -- I [indecipherable] to -- as angry I was in the beginning for her to saying this to me, I -- I -- you know, I was really upset. Well, I said, if she\u2019s starting to cry, maybe I touched a nerve in her. So I was going to hug her, and she stepped back. She says to me, you know, I will never forget you. And I said to her, you know what? As long as you will never forget me, please remember what I want to tell you. If you see any children when their lives will be threatened, speak up. Because your father didn\u2019t. And that\u2019s how she walked out. Now, re -- now I feel that I touched her, I touched one person. And that makes me feel good, that maybe if she\u2019s going to see a child in danger, whether it\u2019s a Jew, or a non-Jew, or green or yellow or purple, maybe she\u2019|l be there and say wait a second, we cannot afford of doing that, we shouldn\u2019t do that.

I remember going to work in Germany and kids would be -- you know, near their picket fences in the house. You know, kids 10 - 11 years old, something like that, playing. And when they saw us pass by, they started spitting and screaming [speaks German here]. You see now, when kids are being brought up with this hate, I don\u2019t really think they\u2019re capable of loving other people, even though at that time they were hating the Jews. But I think when you bring up kids hating, they eventually hate. Their life will be a hate. It\u2019s very destructive, very destructive. Very destructive. So now I -- I really feel if my kids would be different people, I -- I -- I would say well, you know, there\u2019s nothing we can do. I understand -- I understand, being that my daughter is -- you know, she\u2019s got a degree in microbiology that she -- she tells me a lot of people are, you know, born with certain genes, and I understand that. I understand that, but you still have to nurture that gene. And he -- he might -- he might have the gene of having red hair or black hair or whatever.

To tell you the truth, I think if I would have known all that, maybe I would be afraid that I\u2019m not capable of doing it, at that time, anyway.

For me, I saw the whole thing the way it was, but my husband didn\u2019t really see it the way it was. So -- course everybody was sad and crying there because we knew, we all knew the loss and what went on there. But it\u2019s different. It\u2019s different than when I was there. It\u2019s different. And I was so upset, let me tell you that. They have a -- like a museum, at Interview with Helen Goldkind \u2122 February 21, 2001 least when I was there, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on there today. They have a museum there with pictures, and names. And we had a guide, and I looked at these pictures, because you know, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re Jewish or not Jewish, you look the same to me. People look the same. But then I noticed there was a lot - that there wasn\u2019t any Jewish names that you would call. And I look around and I spend some time there, I couldn\u2019t believe this. So I said to myself, it\u2019s -- maybe it\u2019s me, because you know, it\u2019s maybe -- but there weren\u2019t any Jewish names under these pictures. So I go over to the guide, I says, listen, can you explain me something, because I don\u2019t understand it. You know, I\u2019m the one who was here in Auschwitz and I brought here my whole family, 89 people, tell me how come that there isn\u2019t a name that has a -- sort of a Jewish name. She says to me, well you know -- you know, you remember when you came to Auschwitz you had to take your valise and throw it in the ditch? I says yes, I remember, I -- I do remember. And so we don\u2019t have any documents who came here as a Jew, but we do have the documents who came here that weren\u2019t Jews. So I said to her, you know what? You told me something new that I didn\u2019t realize. I didn\u2019t know that there were some s -- because this is a destruction camp, and I didn't know that there were some non-Jews came here to be destroyed. I knew there were in different camps, some people that resisted Hitler, but I didn\u2019t think they came all the way to Auschwitz. So you just told me something new. So it\u2019s okay, now I will Interview with Helen Goldkind a February 21, 2001 understand it. But [indecipherable]. So she told me there are no Jewish names because there is no record of it, that Jews were sent to Auschwitz. I says, you mean to say a million and a half children that you know went to the gas chamber here and there wasn\u2019t one name of a child? I was so upset there, you have no idea. I was very, very upset. I don\u2019t know what they did with the rest of it there now. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but I better don\u2019t go there because today I can\u2019t take the pain any more. I-I\u2019m too old. So when you talk about this Holocaust Museum, we scraped here a few documents, there a few documents. I mean, they can say a hundred years from today it doesn\u2019t even happen because we don\u2019t have no documents of any kind. So I think that\u2019s important there."
