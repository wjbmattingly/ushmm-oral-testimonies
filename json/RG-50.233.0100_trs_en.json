My grandmother was quite small and she had beautifu l blue eyes, she was the only one with blue eyes. She had a beautiful singing voice which could have been operatic but she preferred just to share her singing talents with her family. She was the family songbird. She sang all the time as she cooked and so forth. My grandfather was extremely, highly respected in the community.

She took the teachings of the Torah rather lite rally in some respects. Every Friday and on every holiday, she would go and collect beggars from the street and she would feed them in her kitchen. On the high holy days, she invited them to share our ho liday meal in our dining room. I remember my grandmother\u2122s dining which because she had eight children, all of whom were married and had children of their own; the table could seat I don\u2122t know how many people, maybe twenty. I remember the beautiful crystal chandelier which hung over it.

So he might not have taught in the Warsaw University but I\u2122m not really sure. In any case, he also gave private lessons at home. My father was not successful in the field of making money. He was kind of a disappointment and disgr ace within the family because my mother\u2122s family was all very aggressive and very well to do. Everybody did exceedingly well and apparently they thought that that was very important and everyone was talented in a different way but ev eryone was sort of well off. My mother was not. It was very disappointing to the family that my mother ma rried my father because she married him on the rebound. She had been in love with a local boy who apparently was a great Zionist and gave her the choice of -- or asked her to go with him to build Palestine. When she refused to leave the family nest and go to such a faraway place, he left without her. I\u2122ve often wondered which hero in the State of Israel might have b een my mother\u2122s childh ood sweetheart and so I romanticize about that.

My father never raised his voice. My father would play with me on the floo r with toys and make -- he was very artistic, apparently and very creative. We played with different colored clay which we made animals and whatever, you know. My father would spend hours in play with me whereas my mother was always busy. She was always baking a nd cooking and sewing and knitting and doing all sorts of -- she was always busy. She was al ways going in and out and coming and shopping and going. My father spent a lot of time at home, probably waiting for students or doing -- marking papers or whatever he did. In any case, I remember that he and I spent a lot of time in my childhood. I remember my fourth birthday. I re member about it that my father had decorated the entire house with streamers that he had made into\u2013 He had cut different colored shiny paper, very shiny paper of different colors and he made chain by gluing loops of varied colors. He decorated the room, I guess it was, with these paper chains which hung from the ceiling in loops and around the walls and so forth. I rememb er that, I don\u2122t know, 20 children or whatever of my age came and they all brought presents. I had a hysterical fit beca use I had received two sets of dominos and I lay on the floor and ki cked and had a tantrum. How wonderful and understanding my father was and how impatie nt and annoyed with the whole nonsense, my mother was. So my mother was a kind of dow n to business personality, probably like I am.

They\u2122re little round -- they were made little round c ookies with some jelly and then a second cookie with a hole in it on top. That was one she made a lot. Then she made a cookie which a friend of my father\u2122s who vi sited quite frequently, I believe he was a professor, Professor Zuckerman, which means su gar man. These were cookies with coarse sugar sprinkled on top and my mother used to ca ll them -- because this gentleman particularly enjoyed those cookies -- so she called those Zuckerman cookies. I remember making those with her. I remember sitting - preparations in my grandmothe r\u2122s kitchen for the holidays. I remember my mother and her sisters and my grandmother all baking and cooking and I remember the challahs that they made. These great long challahs braided with a little braid on top. They always made a little one for me or they gave me dough to play with. I remember that they sat me in a high chair kind of across the -- from, you know, the opposite side of the room from where the ovens were, the heat was. To entertain me, they would say, Mirka, open your mouth. They would fling a raisin across the room and I loved raisins and I would open my mouth and try to catch the raisin. There were great peals of laughter when it hit my nose or never reached near or whatever it was. I just reme mber that with such clarity, it\u2122s incredible and I was four years old. Then I recal l that we left our apartment in great haste, schlepping all sorts of bundles. I remember a big hysterical fight with my mother because I insisted on bringing my favorite possession which was an enormous teddy b ear, almost my own size. It was a Stief teddy bear and my grandmother had bought this te ddy bear on the day I was born and gave it to my mother. I grew up with this teddy bear and he was my companion and I remember that I called that teddy bear by my grandfather\u2122s name which was David. And that teddy bear had to go with me. We left the apartment and I don\u2122t remember by what means we got there. I doubt that it was the trolley. I don\u2122t remember that part but we arrived in my grandparents\u2122 home where there was enormous excitement in the co urtyard, the factory, the house and the people who worked in the factory all lived in surrounding little bungalows on their land. There was enormous excitement, people being loaded into tr ucks and also into the horse drawn carts which had been used to deliver the soda all over Poland and probably all over, I don\u2122t know, Eastern Europe. Everybody was getting into trucks and there were sirens and the light was fading. Then I remember being pushed up into the back of an open truck.

He had big barrels which must have contained somethi ng to do with the soda plant. I don\u2122t know, whatever fruit or, I don\u2122t know, whatever it was. We would s it there on the barrels in the sun. That part of the house faced south. In the afternoon, the sun was there. My grandfather and I would sit there and he would tell me stories. I remember one day, he gave me Hanukkah gelt. I remember he was explaining to me about Hanukkah gelt and I just remember him giving me coins and sitting in the sun and talking about Hanukkah gelt while inside wonderful things were being cooked and delicious smells were coming out of the windows and across the courtyard. Anyway, ge tting back to the story of my uncle Jacob being kicked by the horse, I remember -- oh now -- uncle Jacob, becaus e he was the controller, he wasn\u2122t really involved in the factory nor the stables. He was in the office so he didn\u2122t wear wooden shoes or boots. He wore shoes with laces, you know, like a businessman. So when he went out into the courtyard, it must have been a m uddy situation because he was wearing his shoes. When they brought him in and laid him on the couch, I remember, while they were all running around excitedly calling for doctors and what should we do? You undo his belt and you get cold water to put on his forehead and blah, blah. My aunts and everybody was quite hysterical. I remember untying his shoelaces. I don\u2122t know w hy I remember doing that but that\u2122s what I did while they were all -- they were undoing him and I undid his shoelaces. Years later, when uncle Jacob found me, he -- well shall I te ll you about it later or shall I tell it now? He said to me, do you know me? I said of course I know you. He said but you were so little when you saw me last, how do you know me? I said we ll I remember you perfectly and then I told him this story. He was amazed because he figured out that I coul dn\u2122t have been three. I must have been like two and a half when this happened because he knew when it was before the blitzkrieg because that was probably the last time he saw me.. So I had to have been less than three years old. He found it so amazing that my memory was so clear and that he remembered that and how much he had loved me because I was the only -- I was the youngest of his nieces and was the only child of his favorite baby sister. So I was very special and that act of taking off his shoes was very special for him and the fact that I remember that with such clarity meant a great deal to him. But I\u2122ll get back to that period later. The next couple of years of my life are very fuzzy. The family all stayed together for a very brief period of time and then my grandparents insisted on returning to Warsaw."

            "answer": "To her parents, to her family, you know. They had horrible fights and didn\u2122t get along very well. I remember screaming and whatever. Th en we probably left Poland because I remember an incident where one night I heard my mother crying and my parents were arguing and I came out of bed. There was a fireplace, you know, most ________ was the central heating most places in Europe. My parents were burning Poli sh money; they were burning the bills. My mother was crying because she was lamenting all th e sacrifices that she had made to save this money. My father was telling her instead, foreve r the romantic, look at th e beautiful colors of the flames. Don\u2122t think about what it is. There is no paper in the world that burns as beautifully as that. Look at it, look how it sparkles. Look, come here Mirka. Sit by the fire and watch. Isn\u2122t that beautiful? You\u2122ll never see anyt hing like this again as long as you live and of course I never have seen anyone burn money, pa rticularly Polish money. I remember, oh my G___, I remember being with my parents once in so me other city. We were in a community of people and my mother -- we were on the edge of a fo rest. It was a city on the edge of a forest. My mother knew about mushrooms. You know in Europe there are wild mushrooms, wild mushrooms are picked, there was much more intere st in mushrooms that we have in the United States and there was a great deal to know about them because some of them are poisonous and whatever. Well, my mother apparently was a mushroom maven. A group was organized to go to the forest on a picnic and mushroom picki ng expedition. Several families went in a horse drawn carriage and we drove to the edge of the woods -- or maybe two carriages, I don\u2122t remember. But anyway, we got to the edge of the woods and there was a little boy about my age and we had a picnic on blankets at the edge of the woods, a clearing in the woods, very sunny and pretty, clearing and grass. We had this l ovely picnic. Then my mother told this little boy, you keep an eye on her. He was a little older. You take care of her and we\u2122re going into the woods. Don\u2122t worry, we\u2122ll be back, you stay here and play right here. Don\u2122t go further than this spot or whatever she told him. And he and I began to play and run around. We got to bushes suddenly, big bushy things an d I said to him, look those are berries, they\u2122re raspberries, I\u2122m sorry, blueberries, you know, blueberries. He said, yes. There were several kinds of berries growing and we began to pick these berries and eat them and stuff our mouths with them. I had on a dress with a pinafore or apron or somethi ng and I took the skirt and made a sort of pouch and held it in one hand and put the berries into my apron. He began to pull the berries off the bush and he climbed up and we had my apron filled when we heard some noise. Suddenly all the adults came flying out of the forest and I was so excited to show my mother what I had found. My mother started to scream, come it\u2122s ra ining and she took the berries and put them in something and she just -- there wasn\u2122t time to be excited. My mother was impatient. I already told you that."

The little boy and I and there were several other children who were older and who had gone into the woods with the mushroom pickers. We were among their feet, you know, undern eath the blankets. Th e taller adults held the blankets aloft over us on the four corners. Huge drops of rain and possibly hail began to fall. With that, two airplanes came flying out of the sky and strafed us and began to shoot. We scattered. They made a pass and my mother sa id, I remember my mother screaming something like the blankets wouldn\u2122t protect us from bullets, scatter. We began to scatter and I wound up in a ditch. When the excitement of the planes and the noise and the bombs or whatever ended, the little boy who had been picking berries with me was lying dead next to me. So that\u2122s an anecdote."

Several of the cars fell down into a ditch and there were many dead and screaming and G____ knows what. We were in the last car of the train and I think that was the only one that was left standing on the track and was not hit. So I remember that. Anyway my mother and I were alone and we wound up in this city, probably in the Ukraine, and very near the village where I wa s ultimately to be hidden. My mother supported us, it\u2122s a terrible word. I mean she provided the little we had by knitting. I know that sounds ridiculous but my mother would take your old sweater with the holes in the elbows and she would rip out the yarn and out of that torn, holey sweater, she w ould make you a vest or a short sleeve sweater or whatever it was. She knitt ed day and night. I remember listening to my mother\u2122s knitting needles, even in the night. My mother smoked. I remember seeing her cigarette in the dark. My mother was an ex ceptional knitter and she could knit in the dark without having to look. I remember going into bo mb shelters during air raids and my mother would say to me, I\u2122m here, just listen to my needles and you k now I\u2122m here. You needn\u2122t be afraid as long as you hear my needles. If she wasn\u2122t knitting, she was smoking. She\u2122d say, watch, that\u2122s my cigarette. I would watch her face suddenly light up as se took a puff of her cigarette. But most of the time she was knitting. She knitted all the time. She would ask me to hold out my hands. When she ripped a sweater , she would wind the yarn around my hands. My two outstretched hands. Then she would wind it into a ball from my hands. I remember holding out my hands and getting very tired and complaining a great deal but that was how she supported us. I know that at night, she would sneak out after the curfew and she would go to the parts of the city where she wasn\u2122t allowed to go be, to deliver her goods. One time she took me with her. That was rare, usually she left me back in our room with my teddy bear, my David, my treasured possession. She took me with her into the city and she said she was taking me to a lady who, I must be very careful and I must not speak only to say please and thank you and to be very polite, other than that to not speak. If I\u2122m asked a question only to say yes and no and not to say anything. Because where we were going was very dangerous but this was a very generous lady and she would probably serve tea and cake or cookies. That was why my mother was going to take a chance and take me because we might get something very delicious to eat, or jam, jam. So we went and we cro ssed into a section that I don\u2122t remember by what means or what but I know we were n\u2122t allowed o be there. We we nt into a house and I just seem to remember that it was a white house and it had a door. We went inside and inside was a very cozy home, a cozy room with lovely upholstered furniture and a lot of pillows. There was a piano and it had a shawl over it and a beautif ul vase filled with flowers. There were photographs and there were a lot of pictures and paintings and things on the walls. We sat on an upholstered, lovely carved settee with a table in front. Just as my mother had predicted, this lady brought out a tray with a tea service on it with cookies and jam and toast and wonderful things. I ate and oh it was so wonderful."

It turned out that this lady was a -- well she did beautiful needlework. She did these pictures which were framed which were both embroidered and appliqu\u00e9d. For example, there was one -- well I\u2122ll tell you about that one because it almost caused our death. Al so the reason she called my mother into another room is because this lady also made dolls whic h were fully clothed adult dolls but they were apparently anatomically correct. So she showed th is lovely doll but then invited my mother into this next room so that she could undress this ma le doll and show my mother that it had all its anatomical parts. Well, while my mother and this lady were out of the room I turned and looked at the wall behind me on which hung a pict ure that this woman had also made. The picture was of a sort of cottage and a yard filled with chickens and there were flowers against the cottage and there were little windows with shutters and a door and so forth. There was a girl throwing feed from an apron, just like I had desc ribed before, throwing seed out to chickens. There were chickens all over, feeding and flying around and whatever. All of this was appliqu\u00e9d and embroidered and so on and very in tricate. Suddenly I realized to my horror or fascination that the girl feeding the chickens had a yellow star on her chest. When my mother came out of the other room with this lady, I absolutely couldn\u2122t help but point it out. Look she has a yellow star. With that this woman flew into a rage, pointed a finger at my mother and said, you did that, it wasn\u2122t there before, you\u2122re responsible, you did that! She screamed out of the door for the police. My mother and I ran out. There were two police and I can\u2122t tell you what they were but I think they had brown\u2013."

My mother grabbed me and we ran and hid and we got away. At that time, my moth er and I shared a room with another lady in a sort of a boarding house which must have been all Jews. I don\u2122t know whether the woman who owned this home was Jewish or not, I only re member that she -- I remember a lot about her actually. One of the things that I remember is that she kept talking about her son who was in the army and who was going to come home. She had cookies or mondelbrut that she had baked and she had it in packages under a cabinet. She showed us that she had baked this and she was saving it for her son, it was his favorite thing. As soon as sh e knew where he was, she would send it to the front, send some to the front. But if that wasn\u2122t possible that was okay, because he would be home soon and then she would have this for him. My mother and the lady who shared the room with us gave each other a knowing sort of look and then my mother, every night, proceeded to steal some of the cookies."

The colors were all pastel, little bumps all over this fabric. They were beautiful, pale lave nder and pink and light green and blue and just sort of a capelet, a little cape on top of the shoulders.

When she came home -- and the coat had yellow stars on it -- when she returned home from wherever she had been, the fur had been removed from her coat.

The villages -- surr ounding these villages were the farms. The land had been divided after the fall of the Czars, Czar, First Worl d War, had been divided among the peasants. Previous to that, it was owned by the Church. So that now although the people were very religious and were very loyal to the village priest and they were very generous to him; he was no longer as wealthy and flamboyant as they ha d been during the time of the Czars, during White Russia. But because the peasants were reli gious, the priests lived a far better life than did the peasants. Now it\u2122s the Greek Orthodox Churc h, the Bible is in Greek. The priests marry and have families. The families were the intelligentsias, if you will, of the village.

So when my mother explained our plight and the possibilities of our disaster, Rya being an altruistic, kind and religious teenager said, well I\u2122ll take her home and hide her with me, without any thought to the consequences or to the reaction of her family or the possible danger to herself, her family, the entire village, the future, I mean, you know, nothing. She simply offered and my mother jumped at the opportunity. So my mother sent me off with a little pack age of clothing wrapped around a handkerchief, my teddy bear who was now significantly smaller than I was. I remember walking down the front steps. I reme mber my mother standi ng on the stairs saying don\u2122t turn around. Just go, walk through the gate and don\u2122t turn around, keep walking. Remember what I told you, remember what I told you. We walked through the -- down the stairs and through the garden. I remember th at the garden was overgrown and unkempt and wilted and a great mass of jungle. It had been cu ltivated at one time. That\u2122s why I -- it was late summer. I remember walking with Rya holding my hand and I holding on to my teddy bear and Rya with the bundle. We walked out and I turn ed once to look at my mother and she was holding a handkerchief up to her face. She yelled again don\u2122t turn around, keep walking. That\u2122s my last memory of my mother. I don\u2122t ev en remember getting to the village or anything about it. I don\u2122t remember arriving, I don\u2122t remember any of that."

When I looked at it, it looked like a clown face b ecause it had a big window on each side of the door and the steps -- it looked like a clown with his tongue hanging out. It had a sharp point at the top of the cross with the slash underneath. The road went around it. Behind the church was a small cemetery with crosses, stone crosses. There was a legend that the cross of the priest whose family I was about to live with, that stone cross grew every year. The people wee so superstitious and they had revered this particular priest to such a degree that these legends about him grew. Anyway, the houses conti nued as the road -- the two roads\u2013"

On the opposite side of town, to my right, as I was facing the church was a road that led out to the fields where all of the various wheat and grain and hemp and barley and whatever all was grown was. That was the entire town. There was no electricity, there were no automobiles, there were no telephones. The donation that I made to you, I wrote a little piec e to go with it. The little dress we grew our own hemp. We spun on a spinning wheel, we spun the yarn. It was loomed at home, on a loom. I sewed it by hand. Life was primitive. I am sure that it was no different than it had been two centuries before. That was the life of the village."

There is usually a fireplace in one room and the wall agains t which the fireplace is in one room is the bed wall in the adjacent room simply because of the heat, you know, the warmth. There was one room which must have been th e back of the kitchen , the wall behind where the oven where we baked our bread was. We used to sit in that r oom a great deal. Or if not sit, we would stand with our hands behind our back leaning on that warm wall. We would take turns because only one spot on the wall was really warm and so we would take turns. That was how our evenings were spent. We would tell stories. In fact, Rya devised a game. She would start a story. She would say Mirka and Vali were two beautiful children and they went on a picnic. When they got out to the woods a wolf suddenly jumped out from behind a tree and Mirka said ---, and she would point to me and I would have to pick up th e story. Then I would take the story to some precipice and the next person would go on with it. This is how we entertained ourselves at night and then we would all go to sleep."

She was spoken of in the way you speak of a -- almost a god or a monarch, or whatever. Very highly respect ed and revered. People paid court. There were obligatory visits that they had to make. They brought bask ets of fruit, or whatever, to visit her. They would nod in our direction whethe r we were sitting by the window or not, nod toward our house as they walked by to pay respect, that sort of thing. Now she was a very bright woman. It was decided that my new iden tity was going to be that she was -- she spoke fluent Polish -- she was very well educated. Sh e was fluent in Polish so my identity was going to be that she was Polish and had married the Uk rainian priest but she had a sister back in Poland and I was that sister\u2122s child. That was -- since I came from, I don\u2122t know where, wherever they had me come from in Poland, my Ukrainian was not perfect, my Russian was not absolutely perfect, but that was the excuse.

            "question": "You were given a new last name?",
            "answer": "Yes, yes. So I had a new last name which wa s a Polish last name. Theirs was a Russian name, obviously. I remember only that my name was purported to have ended in ski whereas theirs ended in kvov which son of whatever as does ski, I think. In any case, so I was --well, it\u2122s irrelevant, okay, I won\u2122t give you all that. In any case, this woman had five children. The oldest was Ivan and Ivan was the son who really didn\u2122t take too terribly well to education. I don\u2122t think he was ever sent abroa d. He was sort of more intere sted in farming. He was very practical, he was the farmer. He was huge, he ha d a moustache, he never smiled, he rolled his own cigarettes, he spat into a spittoon. You know, he was more like a peasant. He was very well liked and respected and he was like one of the boys and probably the head boy, you know. Then there was a middle son and he was very rebellious. He ultimately ran off to the forest and was with the partisans. In fact, I used to hide out by the woods when the Germans came. At one point, I was hidden in the hayloft, haystack rather. He onc e or twice came and gave me messages which I carried back. But I hardly remember him because he left. I don\u2122t even remember his name. I remember that his mother -- I remember his mother describing him to someone, and she said, and it\u2122s funny because it\u2122s an expression that I\u2122ve used many times because it described him so well, it described his nature. She said that this middle son when he has a cause or feels strongly about something woul d fight until he was up to his knees in blood. I don\u2122t know whether that was a Russian saying but I\u2122ve heard myself saying that in describing such a person, a kind of tenacious stubborn person. The youngest son was two years older than I was. His name was Vali and I was -- he and I slept in the same bed. I was, I don\u2122t know, five and a half, six; he was two years older. I can de scribe him perfectly. He was very tow headed. He had a cowlick in sort of in the wrong place. It was just above the widow\u2122s peak where his hairline began. He had a sort of a double cowlick with cowlicks going in opposite directions at that point. Because of that, his hair was almost shaved off. Because had it not been, it probably wouldn\u2122t have been able to sort of stay all in the same direction. So he has this Russian version of a crew cut. So those were the three sons. The two daughters were Rya, who I\u2122ve already told you about and the older one whose name I r eally don\u2122t remember and whom I didn\u2122t get to know very well because she already worked and lived in, sort of in town. So she had some sort of office type job. Rya was the homemaker and Ivan was the farmer who grew the whatever, the provider and the man about the house. Vali was the kid and my playmate sort of, and the middle boy was the rebellious, I don\u2122t know, 14 year old he was, who ran off and joined the partisans and became what we called a Cossack. So that was the household. Now I was not received with any degree of love or kindness. I wa sn\u2122t sheltered or shielded or loved at all. I was tolerated, I was respected and I was sort of taken care of but never with kindness, never with love. I was never complimented. If I did something very well, it was -- more than anything I had the feeling of resentment. Furthermore, I was from the city. I was urbane and Vali was a peasant. He had never been to the city. I described the building in which I lived which had four floors. He couldn\u2122t understand that there was a r oom above a room. I explained to him that it was like the attic where they dried their apple slices on a -- strung from one end to another -- and stored things. Al so like the cellar where the cabbage slaw was kept and that, in fact, his house had three floors. But these were four floors of one above the other, bedrooms and, you know, apartments. I described one apartment building. He couldn\u2122t conceive of such a thing. He couldn\u2122t conceive of such a thing as chocolate either. So that when we were finally invaded by the German army, the first time I was hidden in the haystack which I already mentioned. But then they went back and forth and in and out. They were, you know, driven out by the Russians and there was fighting back and forth. So they were there several times, in and out. At some point, I became very brazen and I wound up sitting on the laps of officers. They would pinch my cheeks, kiychy-koo and play with me and so forth and give me chocolate. I would then take the chocolate and give it to Va li. Until the mother found out about this and put a stop to it because it was, you know, absolutely li fe threatening. Well, anyway I never really had any love. I was incredibly lonely. I kept thinking about my mother. One day, it just occurred to me that she\u2122s not living and she\u2122ll never come back. Meanwhile the mother, Vali\u2122s mother, Rya\u2122s mother, was teaching me to read, to sew, to be a Ukrainian child, girl. Taught me all the things, how to spin, how to weave, how to sew, how to mend, how to cook a little bit although it was very difficult because of the prim itive style of cooking in deep ovens with iron pots. You know, children couldn\u2122t physically ma nage that but everyone had jobs and mine was peeling the potatoes. In the time that I was there, in the two and a half years, I must have peeled ten truckloads of potatoes, that\u2122s all I did. I peeled potatoes. I read with the mother and at first she would read to me. She read me Bible stories. She would read to me and she would point to the words with her finger. I would watch her moving finger across the page and then she would turn the page and there would be a picture that related to the stor y. She would continue the story and I kind of fell in love with one story. I kept asking her to read it over and over. It was the story of the prodigal son. I don\u2122t know why I liked that one especially but somehow\u2013 So she read it over and over and then one day in the middl e of the story, she sort of looked up and she said, you read, and I did. And not only did I read but -- maybe because I had heard that one so many times -- I understood it and I read it and we turn the page and went on to the next story. At one point we turned the page and there was a picture of little girls cr ossing a little bridge over a -- you know -- like a little stream. Hovering -- and there was a very sort of rickety little bridge, maybe a log, whatever it was, and it looked dangerous with the rushing water underneath. Hovering in flight with arms outstretched behind the little child was an angel with beautiful wings like a bird and a flowing gown. I said what is that and she explained to me about angels. I said everybody has an angel? She said every child has an angel to protect it. I said even Jewish children? She said yes, even Jewish children and even you. You have a very special angel. So that night I went to sleep and I woke up and I knew who my angel was. I was absolutely certain that my own angel was the infant Jesus and that I would be protected because I had a Jewish angel. No harm would come to me . I knew that I would be all right. I can tell you a lot of stories about life in that village. I was there two Christmases and three Easters or maybe the other way around. It\u2122s the other way around. One day, you\u2122re not going to believe this, you\u2122re not going to believe this\u2013 One day in the middle of the severest winter, a horse drawn sled came into town on the road, which wa s an event. I mean nothing came in the winter. Sometimes, you know, if the German army was there, the trucks came but we never saw anything like cars or\u2013. In fact, once a car came and all the child ren of the village gathered around the car and stared at it as if it was a flying saucer."

He was the head butcher in charge of -- he never touched the meat but he was in charge of all the food.

In the dream, he dreamed he was back in Warsaw, it was before the war. He was wearing his tails and top hat because he had come from a ball or gone to the opera, or whatever it was. He was walking along the street with his walking stick and as he got near the street lamp, gas lit street lamp, he heard the clippety clop of an oncoming carriage. It was a very foggy night and out of the fog approached this horse drawn black carriage. He tried to peer inside but he couldn\u2122t see because of the f og but it stopped right under the street lamp. A woman leaned forward and she was all dressed in white.

She said to him, Jacob, I kno w this sounds ridiculous. Everything has been done for my child and my child is given up for dead. There are no more medical cures. I know you\u2122ll think it\u2122s silly but there\u2122s one last thing that we haven\u2122t done. We haven\u2122t tried to fool the dybbuk, the dybbuk wants my child. He says tell me , I\u2122ll do anything. My mother said, we must fool the dybbuk into thinking this is a differ ent child. He said well what, what should we do? So she said to him, well I will sell you th is child and you will give her a new name and she\u2122ll be yours and then the dybbuk won\u2122t want he r anymore because it\u2122s not the child that the dybbuk wants. He said all right. How much do you want for her? She said well what is a child\u2122s life worth? Give me your hat. He took off his hat. She said okay take this hat, fill it with pennies, bring it back and I will give you my child. So he went and he filled the hat with pennies and he came back and he bought me. She said, Jacob, what is your child\u2122s name? He said her name is Chai Berliner. Chai because it means life. And I survived and I got well. So I was very precious to Jacob. All that bubba meinsa fits, you see. It just was meant that Jacob would find me. All right, so Jacob and I traveled . We stayed in all kinds of places. There was one time I remember, he woke me very early in the morning. We were in a room somewhere. We had slept -- it was so cold. I used to slee p on top of him, huddled on top of his chest, snuggled up. I was tiny, teeny. He woke me, he said quickly get up, we must get dressed. But Wujaszek I called him Wujaszek, wujak in Polish is uncle, wujaszek is diminutive, a loving --. But Wujaszek, but it\u2122s still dark, it\u2122s so cold, I can\u2122t get dressed. He said here you dress inside the bed, under the covers. While you dress, I\u2122ll get you the milk. I have milk. He reached for the milk which was sitting in a bottle on the corn er but the bottle was full and it had -- the milk had frozen and the bottle had cracked."

It\u2122s the middle of the night. He said, come, we must rush, we must run. He explained nothing. I dressed and we walked and walked and walked. It was still dark and we got to the market in the first light of morning. Instead of the usual stalls, the farmers selling their produce, there were just hundreds and hundreds of people in this cobblestone marketpla ce. As the morning dawned, Jacob said I\u2122m going to put you on my shoulders. I want you to watch and no matter how horrible the sight, I want you to keep your eyes open and watch. I said, Wujaszek, what am I going to see? Why are we here? He said th ey\u2122ve caught some German officers and they are going to hang them and I want you to watch. Why? He said because I don\u2122t want you to have any hate. The man you\u2122re going to see hanged is the man who murdered your mother. He sat me on his shoulders and I watched three men bei ng hung. He just didn\u2122t want me to hate. He wanted it all to -- he wanted me to be healthy -- to let it all out in this one traumatic, ugly, horrible experience."

I\u2122ll be back at seven o\u2122clock. I want you to sit here and listen to the radio. Here\u2122s paper and pencil. Just listen. If you hear -- don\u2122t change the station -- it\u2122s on just the station. Listen carefully, if anything sounds familiar, write it down. I would listen a ll day to coded messages, messages like Wujaszek is searching for the little girl who untied his shoelaces -- only usually shorter. Or there would be lists of names. The following are documented to have died in Treblinka and then an hour of names. He would come home, what do you have? While I was doing that, he was going to various agencies, searching and looking and authenticating and documenting deaths and looking for survivors. There were none. Finally one day he said that\u2122s it. We got into one of those boxcars of which there is a photograph that I gave you. It\u2122s only many years later in the United States that I realized what was written on the exterior of that boxcar. It\u2122s in English and in Hebrew. It says \ufb01To Liberty.\ufb02 And \ufb01From Auschwitz to New York.\ufb02 You know when I arrived in the United States I didn\u2122t speak any English whatsoever.

A little bit of schooling in the village but only until it got too cold for me to walk barefoot to the school because I had no shoes Then in the D.P. camp to which we went in that boxcar and the D.P. camp was in Munich. We were in the D.P. camp for, I can\u2122t tell you how long, maybe a year or more. In the D.P. camp, Jacob had the job of being in charge of the social hall which meant he was the electrician, the plumber; he set up the chairs , he took them down, he was the stage manager and he was the emcee of all the various goings on. Being handsome and charming and witty, he was the perfect emcee. I went to school in the morning but school was mostly the learning of Hebrew. Because most of the people in the D.P. camp, all of them, were going to Palestine. It was kind of embarrassing or shameful to admit that we were going to America. So I went to school and studied Hebrew. When I came to the United Stat es, I spoke Polish, Russian, Ukrainian. I could understand Greek, a little bit of Hebrew, a little bit of German and somewhat more, I was able to understand but not speak fluently, Yiddish. If I\u2122m not mistaken, that\u2122s seven languages."

            "question": "Had you known any Yiddish before?",
            "answer": "Well, my grandparents in their home spoke Yi ddish and Polish so I heard it. There was no Yiddish spoken between my parent s. Of course, I heard it after my experience in the Ukraine as we were displaced persons traveling from place to place. I left out one part of the story and I will tell it to you as briefly as I can. The one part of my story which I never really told and the reason I\u2122m telling you now is that earlier today, I to ld it in front of my children. It\u2122s the first time my children ever heard it. So now I feel at li berty to tell it to the wo rld. It\u2122s not something of which I\u2122m proud of but it\u2122s a si gnificant part of my life. My father left us. I can\u2122t with all honesty say that he deserted us. But it sure felt that way. My father was a blue- eyed blond. My father was a linguist, he was fluent in German and he could pass. Whereas, he promised to send for us, he didn\u2122t. It could easily have been impossible. It\u2122s not something I\u2122ll ever know. But I resented my father and when my mother became Berliner again, changing her name back to her maiden name, I simply went along with th at. I went along with my mother\u2122s attitude about my father which wasn\u2122t generous. It wasn\u2122t severe or bad either but their last months together were not affectionate. So I felt th at my father had betrayed and deserted me throughout the war and I never thought about him. In the D.P. camp, while Jacob was working at the duties in the social hall which was an all day and evening job, I went to school in the morning where I studied Hebrew. Then when sc hool ended in the morning, I would have lunch with Jacob and then I was free in the afternoon. Now Jacob told me that we were going to go to America on a ship across a big ocean. The ship would sway back and forth and there was a good possibility that I would be seasick. I had neve r been seasick but he described it. To avoid that, it would be a wonderful idea if I acclimated myself to th e swaying motion by going to the playground and spending my time on the swings. So I spent every afternoon on the swings. Now the swings faced a cyclone fence. On the opposite side of the fence, this was Munich, there was a bench, a bus stop and in the afternoon a bus would come. Now I sat on the swings, swinging back and forth every day. Every day about an hour before the bus came, or half an hour, an old woman would come and she would s it on the bench and she would take out of her bag, a little package of crumbs. She would thro w the crumbs to the little birds, pigeons, or whatever it was. She would turn around and she would nod to me. This happened afternoon after afternoon so finally we began to chat. Then one day she said to me, why are you spending so much time on the swings? So I explained I\u2122m going on a long voyage on a ship. I\u2122m going to America and I know that I\u2122m going to get seasic k and I explained the whole thing. She said, you know, I have a brother in America. Some day, I\u2122m going to go to my brother when my quota number comes up. I said well if you\u2122re going to go on a ship, then you will be wise to get acclimated to the swaying also. From then on, in stead of feeding the birds and sitting on the bench, she would come inside and she would sit on the swings. We would swing back and forth criss-crossing each other and chatting away. One day as displaced persons do, we began to talk about our backgrounds.. She began to ask me questions. What is your name, who are you, where are you from? I told her about my life be fore the blitzkrieg in Warsaw, my father had been a violinist and a violin teacher. She said tell me his name. I told her his name. The next day she returned and we sat on the swings and she said to me, tell me, do you have any marks on your body? Anything that could identify you? Anything that\u2122s different from anything that anybody in the world has? I said yes. I have a beauty mark on my right forearm, shoulder. When I was a little girl, my grandfather used to tease me by making believe he took the beauty mark off my right forearm until I began to cry. Then he\u2122d say, don\u2122t cry, don\u2122t cry, I\u2122ll give it back. Then he would give it ba ck to me on my left forearm or shoulder and I would look and there it would be. So she left and came back the next day and she said, that was a very interesting story about your grandfather but isn\u2122t there anythi ng else on your body, any scars, anything that\u2122s different and unique ? I said well, I don\u2122t like to talk about it but we have a family trait and I was born with it also. We have six toes. My uncle Jacob has six toes on one foot. When I was born, I had six toes on each foot. They were surgically removed and I have a scar on each foot. The next day the woman came and brought my father. I don\u2122t know where he survived but I think in Germany. Well my fath er insisted that I stay with him but we were going to sail two weeks hence. Having waited for our quota number, having found the uncle in America. I mean all of these -- years of waiti ng and uncle Jacob said absolutely not. They argued and uncle Jacob had the same resentment or appeared to have the same resentment towards my father that my mother had had. I didn\u2122t show him great warmth."

By the time he came a year later I had begun to -- I had not begun -- I had succeeded to a great extent in as similating into American life, just like the chameleon I learned to be in the Ukraine. I did, once again, of necessity, in the United States.. I had arrived here on June 24. By September, I wa s in school.

Oh my G__, it\u2122s incredible what 50 years will do. But there was my father and he wanted to undo the year of very hard adjustment. So I said no. He argued with my aunt and uncle. I now was living with the rich uncle in America and his American wife and going to school in Forest Hills, Long Island, P.S.3. My teacher was Mrs Riskin and th e principal was Mrs. Morris. My G__, how do you remember all that Miki? Anyway I didn\u2122t wa nt to go back with my father. My father persisted and now my birthday came and my father sent me a gift. Actually a very beautiful gift. A box of oil paints and brushes. However he addressed it Mirka -- I still can\u2122t say it, his last name -- in care of Berlinrer. I was mor tified because the mailman knew and the doorman might know. The girl who lived on the floor belo w might find out. Everyone might find out and oh my G___, it\u2122s all going -- he\u2122s going to turn it all around for me. They\u2122ll start to point at me again and I\u2122ll be da greena again. And there was huge arguments between my aunt and uncle and my father who persisted. Then my uncle of fered my father the -- he said he wanted to legally adopt me. It didn\u2122t mean that my father couldn\u2122t have a relationship with me, we could have any relationship that we mutually wanted. I could visit him, I c ould go on a travel with him or whatever. But he wanted to legally adopt me to give me the benefits of his moderate wealth and American citizenship and so forth. Of course my father refused. The arguments went back and forth. Then one day my father sent a letter which name d a sum of money for which he would sign the adoption papers. That caus ed my aunt and uncle to tell him to get lost. Consequently, I was not adopted until I was 21. Now I already told you the story of the chocolate bar and how the UNRRA gave the mont hly packages and the family who had a child under ten received the added chocolate bar. So my uncle Jacob registered me as being a year younger. Consequently, I was really, in fact, 22 when I became free to sign the papers myself and I became a citizen in that year. I was also engaged to my husband who gave me an engagement ring on the very anniversary of my arrival in the United States which was June 24."

I remember seeing the little buildi ng with the light inside and so forth. Anyway we walk in, a blizzard of snow flies in with us. There\u2122s this guy sitting at th e desk and there are maybe half a dozen people who look like ruffians, men, very rough looking characters sitting on the floor. Some are smoking, and they are sort of loungi ng on the floor on bundles, obviously waiting for the train. We walk in and Jacob is very we ll dressed and he has these two important looking suitcases and this little child all bundled up. We walk in and there was one other item which I forgot, extremely important. The guy at the desk has this telegraph machine and a small radio with a great deal of static and he\u2122s listening to this radio. We co me in and we sit separate from these rough looking men. Jacob goes and talks to th e man and explains to him that we want to get on the train. The man argues with Jacob a nd says no, no, you can\u2122t get on the train. They argue back and forth.
