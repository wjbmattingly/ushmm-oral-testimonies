            "question": "In May 1940, the ghetto was sealed. Did you and your family, your parents and your grandparents, did you have to move from your apartment or where did you live? And, how did you feel about being in the ghetto?",
            "answer": "When they started to speak about the ghetto, I didn\u2122t know what it is. I asked my father what was the ghetto? And, he told me that in the dark ages there were ghettos, but afterwards couldn\u2122t get anymore, but he sa id, \ufb01You\u2122ll see. We\u2122ll be all with Jews and at least we have the Germans. We have the Germans. We know that they\u2122re our enemies, but at least we won\u2122t have the Poles to what they were doing with us and beat us up and so on.\ufb02 And\u0152 we didn\u2122t know what\u2122s going to happen. So, I went in \u0152 we went in to the ghetto. I lived at Gesia, Gesia 7 apartment 8, and it was a good apartment. The house belonged to my grandfather. He was a very wealthy man. We were not, but he was. And, so we didn\u2122t have to move, but my father \u0152 my father work ed I said in wholesale, retail/wholesale, and they called themselves grinszpan. So, I went \u0152 he send me because he was afraid to go. I went there and we brought one of the brothers, and he came to our house and lived with us for a while. Afterwards, I don\u2122t know how it was because I don\u2122t remember. He left the house. We had a big house, but they were \u0152 people who took part a way to place newcomers, we had to give up two rooms for pe ople to live there. It was very \u0152 the ghetto had room about 25,000 people to be there. We squeezed in 165,000 people in the place. There\u2122s room for 25. It was terrible. People didn\u2122t know what to do. It was cold, also. The worst of all was the hunger. We didn\u2122t have no food. People started to die because we didn\u2122t have no food, and to say what is food it\u2122s so hard to say because nobody understands what food. You can eat something. It\u2122s okay, but if you don\u2122t have nothing to eat. You don\u2122t see your neighbor. You don\u2122t see your parents. One thinking, you think all one thing \u0152 eat, eat, eat and you have nothing to put in your mouth. People started to die, and all over the ghetto there were people with open eyes, and you looked at them and you thought, \ufb01Give me some food and I will get up.\ufb02 But they were dead. The Germans said, \ufb01If you make shops and work, we \u2122ll give you what to do and we\u2122ll give you food.\ufb02 It was made in a short time, and they started to send me. To live, you need 2,400 calories daily. We received 200 calories. It\u2122s a fact that people were just who eat no more than 200 calories can live most eight months. I lived five years with 200 calories. I don\u2122t know how I ever survived. I don\u2122t know how."

            "answer": "We received a kilo \u0152 kilo is a two pounds, tw o pounds of bread. It was dark black and full of water inside. Two pounds for five days, and soup. They gave us some vegetables and they were old. It was nothing to eat, almo st nothing. People died. That\u2122s why we died. And, that was \u0152 but, they permitted to make schools in ghetto. So, we had \u0152 they called them Juden Alteste. Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski, and he thought that he was the emperor of the ghetto, and this emperor opened schools. So, I went to school. It was, of course, to learn also, but the main thing wa s a soup. You received a soup day. It was not the \u0152 it\u2122s more water than vegetables, but it was a soup, and it\u2122s \u0152 I think it\u2122s one of the reasons that I survived too. My survival is also, I think, because the love I received at Page 4 home, and I never was beaten up to die. I ne ver received a beaten up. They didn\u2122t beat me up. That\u2122s why I\u2122m here."

We had in the ghetto, they made \u0152 they made a \u0152 how do I say \u0152 we wrote to Rumkowski. He was the emperor, and we ca lled the father. The father, it was not the father, but we had to do it. And, we made a writing for him to the end of the year, we made a writing for him, to him, and who should make it is exactly this Cukier, but he was so dirty. His hands were always dirty and I don\u2122t know. We didn\u2122t have no soap of course, but he was more dirty than other kids. So, he started to ma ke it, and the principal said, \ufb01No, you don\u2122t make it.

            "answer": "We don\u2122t spoke about it, a little, we spoke ve ry little of it because before that, Germany invaded Russia, and they said that we\u2122re going to \u0152 who wants to go with them can go to Page 6 work in Russia. It\u2122s not hard work. They can go, children, the families, or just individuals, who wants to go to work is going to work in agricultural, it\u2122s not bad. See here you\u2122re dying, but there you can have a potato, grow potatoes and that, but you\u2122ll work, and it\u2122s very good job. Many people went out as volunteers. And two uncles of mine, my mother\u2122s two brothers went as volunteers. We know now that all those people went to Chelmno, but we didn\u2122t \u0152 I don\u2122t know. People ju st believed it. But, anyhow, we didn\u2122t have \u0152 we were not in touch anymore with them, and people started to wonder, \ufb01Why don\u2122t they write? What happens?\ufb02 So, the volunteers quit because nobody wanted. So, the made a sperre, gehsperre, also those people who went away, went into gehsperre. Nobody spoke about it because nobody knew where we were going, and that\u2122s why we didn\u2122t bother those people who went away also. I don\u2122t know. We don\u2122t spoke about it, but nobody wanted to get out. So, my father made a hiding. In Poland, if you come in, in the front of the house, you\u2122ve got doors, and each door means a room. If you hide one, you don\u2122t have any room. So, my father pushed a cupboard \u0152 my father pushed a cupboard in front of the door. So, when they came in there was nothing \u0152 there was no room \u0152 no door, no room. We went in the bo ttom of this cupboard and the other room we went in. If something happened in this room, we went in about 13 or 14 people in there. Who made it was my father. In the beginning, the Germ ans didn\u2122t know it, but afterwards they pushed the cupboards to see. They were not dumb also. So, looked \u0152 and they told us, \ufb01Who\u2122s going to be in the hiding will be shot on the spot.\ufb02 They did. So, we went in there, and there came in a child \u0152 a child of three or four months in the same building. It was forbidden, but there was an exception. There was a child. And when they came in, they said that they will shoot, and we hear a shot. We have to go down there, and they\u2122ll segregate who can stay together and who can not. Before that, they took out all the children, all the children of the ghetto. They took out and they said they\u2122re going to resettle, but all died in Chelmno. Then, by th at time, they had children. They were going to take children 10 to 12 or 10, 12, and elder people, but they took others also. They had to have 5,000 a day, and if they would not have 5,000, they took other who could work. They didn\u2122t like it. They didn\u2122t have to. They never did what they said. And, they went in \u0152 this child went in with their father a nd mother, and all the time they came in and the child started to cry. So, this sperre, people started to cover the child with blankets and all was in his hand, and the child didn\u2122t cry anymor e. We were in there \u0152 we didn\u2122t breathe. It was \u0152 it\u2122s something you can\u2122t \u0152 I don\u2122t know how to say it what I felt there. I wasn\u2122t standing, didn\u2122t sit. Somebody sitting didn\u2122t stand up. We were afraid to breathe, they hear us breathe. I don\u2122t know how long it took. It took \u0152 every second was ten years, every minute was ten years. And, afterward, we heard outside crying and shoots, and then people were crying. Afterward, they went away, the child \u0152 the child was dead. My father make a mouth to mouth, but the child was dea d. That time we were n\u2122t discovered, but at night those couple, the couple with the child went and gave themselves up to the Germans.

People go out, we take, we se nd to another place. They are replaced, and we need you because you are good and you are working and we need you in production. And, also this Rumkowski, I think he knew that it\u2122s not true, but he always said and made speeches that we\u2122re going to live. He said, \ufb01I brought you in the ghetto\ufb02 That\u2122s not true, \ufb01And, I\u2122ll get you out of the ghetto.\ufb02 Of course, it was not true, but always the same. They stimulated, the Germans, and the Jewish ghetto Aeltesten. They stimulated us to believe that we were to live."

First of all, we were \u0152 there were fences, fences, and we couldn\u2122t go to the fences. There were so me streets where the fences were people couldn\u2122t walk there. I lived near the fence, but didn\u2122t go out on the left side. I had to go always on the right side inside the ghetto to another property and not in the streets. So, we couldn\u2122t go in. Afterwards, the Germans t ook away all Poles, all others on the other side of the fence, and they relocated Ge rmans from Germany and also Germans from Russia. So, I don\u2122t know the distance. There were always a German policeman watching and inside were Jewish policeman watchi ng. So, we were isolated completely, but completely from all the world. We didn\u2122t know what happens on the other side of the street. We knew about, about the Germans going to win or lose by the papers as I said. But, what\u2122s going on in the city and near Chelmno, we didn\u2122t know absolutely nothing, and also in the ghetto, this Rumkowski he ha d spies. If you said something, if he didn\u2122t like or invented even something, you were taken out and sent, it was called the Czarnieckiego. It was a prison, and from that prison people went out of there.

            "answer": "In August 1944, the ghetto was being finished. They came up to us, and said that we\u2122re going to Germany because the Russian army is near, and we\u2122ll be shooted by them as collaborators to the Germans because we\u2122re in ghetto, and they\u2122re going to help us not to be. So, they\u2122re going to take the ghetto as it is with machines and shops and all of us. You\u2122re going to Germany to be better in Ge rmany. Each one will receive to go there, two pounds of bread, and there you\u2122ll have German money and that would going to be good for us to go. We didn\u2122t believe it. So, for two or three days, we were hidden too, my family were hidden. And my father said we\u2122r e going to die here. Let\u2122s go. We\u2122re going to die. So, we gave ourselves up. We were take n to [unintelligible], not far away I lived before the war and in ghetto, and from there, we were taken to a place. I finished up in a place. We didn\u2122t know where we were. People in the meantime, I would like to say something also. That, today, people say that they didn\u2122t know what was going on. Well, when we left Poland, I mean ghetto Lodz, a nd went through to go there, there were people working in the fields, and there was a woman there. She made a cross and prayed for us. So, I said to my father, \ufb01You see peopl e are praying for us.\ufb02 But, after the war, I remembered that. This woman, she knew where we going. She made a cross to death, that we were going to death. So, if she knew all the people who were over there knew too. If, they knew, the village also knew. If the village knew, also the city knew, and if the city knew, all of them knew. They knew and di d nothing. But on the train, went on, and we came in, in a place. They said we had to go out. I want to tell a story also on that train. It was August, it was not so cold, and we became two pounds of bread, each one finished it in two minutes, and we wanted to have, to drink something. They di dn\u2122t put in nothing. In the train I was, a young girl or man, we all were young, and started to cry, \ufb01Water, water. I\u2122m dying. I want water, water, wate r, I\u2122m dying.\ufb02 There was no water. When the Germans came in, we had to give up all we had of value \u0152 gold, silver, furs, all of it, but in that train where I was, a man came up with a watch, a golden watch, and said to the \u0152 we had in all the trains we had a \u0152 there\u2122s a window and he said to he, \ufb01Take this watch and bring water. A person\u2122s dying.\ufb02 He took th e watch but didn\u2122t bring no water. The cries were weaker and weaker. I\u2122m sure that person died of thirst. The two things that marked me all my life \u0152 the child and that person. We came in \u0152 we came in. They opened up the \u0152 they were waiting there, and my father grabbed for my hand not to lose each other. He held me by my pulse and we jumped out the train. They said, \ufb01Women one side. Men down.\ufb02 I was with my father . My father asked they called Kanada, Sonederkommando Kanada, and my father said, \ufb01Where are we?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Shut up. You\u2122re in Auschwitz. The only way out is th e chimney.\ufb02 And, I thought, before we went out, I thought I\u2122m in the \u0152 where they make iron and steel and so, I saw chimney, I said, \ufb01It\u2122s a factory.\ufb02 But, when we came out, my father asked him and he said, \ufb01Shut up. Shut your mouth. You\u2122re in Auschwitz. The only way out is through the chimney.\ufb02 And, women went to one side. It was the last tim e I saw my mother, and my mother was very thin, and I want to tell about my mother . In ghetto, between one organization and the other we could go to a doctor, and the doctor gave or not the medici ne. The medicine was Page 12 a few ounces of bread, and my mother became il l, and the doctor gave her. She didn\u2122t eat it. She brought it to me. I ate this bread. Was my stepmother. She was a mother. My mother was very thin, and she died. I looked for her after the war all over the world, all over the world \u0152 wrote Red Cross and all thi ngs because my mother died in the gas chamber in Auschwitz, in Birkenau. Right \u201at il now, I don\u2122t know how I survived, but I know what for. I survived to be a witness and to say all the world that can not happen again, never, never again. I do it in Brazil. I will apologize also for my English because I speak Portuguese, and Portuguese would be much better, but I hope people will understand, and never again."

I was standing to get the soup, and they came up a Kapo and said to me that I\u2122m for the second time taking soup. I wanted to say something, he said, \ufb01Shut up. You\u2122re in Auschwitz. The only way out is through the chimney.\ufb02 Come, [German]. It means to get beaten up with 25 lashes, and I don\u2122t \u0152 I know only one person who survived 25 lashes. My father saw it. He wanted to say something. I said, \ufb01Don\u2122t talk. Don\u2122t talk.\ufb02 I was afraid they were going to take my father, too, and he went to kill me. I don\u2122t know why he didn\u2122t kill me on the spot, but why he took me. So, I started to march. He kicked me sometimes. I don\u2122t know where I was. In came another one, a friend of his, and said to him, \ufb01Come I want to show you something.\ufb02 So, he said, \ufb01What I going to do with this? I\u2122m going to finish him.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Take out, take another, you have so much wh at do you need him for.\ufb02 So, he went with him. He kicked me right here march zuruk. My father didn\u2122t believe that I came back. I think I was \u0152 I don\u2122t know why I survived. I was dying. He took me there to kill me, and Page 13 I came back. So, afterwards, we were sold as I said to another camp, and this camp of course belonged to Gross Rosen. The camp \u0152 the name of the camp was Kaltwasser, Kaltwasser. This camp was a littl e better because they didn\u2122t beat us. They did beat us, but not so much. At that camp, in the better camp, work was hard, and food was the same, but they didn\u2122t beat so much. The only thing they beat because it was cold and we were working with cement, and we took some paper to put in \u0152 it was so cold \u0152 to put enough in the feet, so cold. And each person who was cat ched with this at night, they\u2122d beat us up. We had numbers. We gave us numbers, also, but not tattooed, but we had on our clothes, and our uniforms, we had numbers. At that camp, they came once and took youngsters, I was in it, took youngsters to stay aside. They came out one of them. I think he was a dentist. He took me in, took me out of this bunch of where we were. Took me in their quarters, and pulled me out a tooth. He said, \ufb01I\u2122m going to pull you out a tooth, and you may cry if you feel something to cry over, just go ahead. Nobody will hear you.\ufb02 Anyway, and without anesthetic, without nothing, he pulled out a tooth. I wanted to stay up. He said, \ufb01Sit down. And, now if you yell, don\u2122t breathe in because I\u2122m going to take out another tooth, and if you cry or someth ing, I kill you right now.\ufb02 And, pulled me out another tooth, two teeth. I don\u2122t know why. From this one, it became five because I used a hook, and spoiled. I make implants to this si de, and here I have a bridge. He took me out five from this side and three on this side, in that better camp, we made ditches, and it was raining so much that night. It was horri ble, and the guards there were well guarded rubber. There was no plastics by that time. With rubber, they were dry, and he said, \ufb01Hey, Jew, bread.\ufb02 He said a little bread. I pulled out of the trench, and put this in my mouth. Other people saw something, I don\u2122t know how. I heard shooting, but people fell on me, and I was offered but the bread I had in my mouth. When they took out my beating, I don\u2122t know. I got out this same soldier, the same SS was near me, looking at me. I knew if I would run or something, he would kill me. So, I stood up, put my head down, couldn\u2122t look at the Germans. It was forb idden. So, I stood. He with his gun, he hit me here. It\u2122s still here. Until today, I don\u2122t breathe with this side. I breathe this side. This is Nazi. The name of the camp was L\u00e4rche. Th ese youngsters, I received a little time ago, I received from Poland a book who said exactly what I\u2122m \u0152 not about me, but about the youngsters that all these people who went \u0152 who were taken out of this camp, were sent back to Auschwitz and they all gone, all was exterminated in Auschwitz, and it was something. It was a blessing that he took me out and pulled my teeth out. If not, I would not be here. There\u2122s so many co incidences, but I think that God wanted me to be here. I think it\u2122s God. I don\u2122t know. Afterwards, we were taken out from L\u00e4rche. It was Kaltwasser and L\u00e4rche. When I was in Kaltwasser, we had to build L\u00e4rche. And, we build L\u00e4rche, and we belonged to a Gross Rosen. We were taken \u0152 they took us to death march, and at that time was almost end of the war. My father said to me, \ufb01I want you to promise me son.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Of course, what do you want father?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01To see the war\u2122s going to end. The Germans look like the Polish Army in \u201a39. One runs forward, the other runs back, and if they won\u2122t kill us, you will survive. And, I want you to do a thing. If you survive, never let people forget what happened to us. Always tell what happened. Maybe some people won\u2122t get out in their head that something so terrible could happen, but you always say and tell what happene d, no matter \u0152 young, old, many, few \u0152 always say it.\ufb02 I promised my father I would. He said to me, \ufb01Now, my child. I\u2122m going to sit down because my feet don\u2122t \u0152 can\u2122t go on anymore. \ufb02 And, to get out of the \u0152 to be to not Page 14 go or sit down, they killed. We went out from there, we went out 600 prisoners, and at the time, my father fell, we were about 50 or 60. Th ey killed all of us. My father said, \ufb01I\u2122m going to sit because my feet \u0152 my feet don\u2122t \u0152 over there.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Father, if you will sit down, I will sit down too. I don\u2122t want to li ve without you.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01No, you have to walk. You have to go. You have to survive because I don\u2122t want\ufb02 Anytime he mentioned to stop or something, I stopped with him, and near us, we were al ways in five. So, a person \u0152 I don\u2122t know who it is, he didn\u2122t survive. I\u2122m sure. He said, \ufb01You want your son to live.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Of course. The only thing, I\u2122m going to die. I\u2122m dying.\ufb02 \ufb01So, put your arm on me, and one arm on your son, and we\u2122ll fall down all the three of us.\ufb02 He was in very bad shape too, but we fall down. My father said, \ufb01They\u2122ll shoot us. They don\u2122t allow it.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Put your arm \u0152 put your arm on us. Let\u2122s go.\ufb02 And, my father after he put one hand on his and one on my shoulder and we went, and it was a miracle. All of a sudden, we had a train from nowhere. There was a train, and our commandant went over to the man who was in it. There was nobody in it, just a train, just only the driver, and we went into this train, and we came to Flossenb\u00fcr g. In Flossenb\u00fcrg, we were in Block 25, in quarantine. It was one of the \u0152 the worst in Flossenb\u00fcrg, and the Kapo killed my father there because he went in and it was cold and my father couldn\u2122t go anymore. So, he went in and he call latrina, and in there he killed my father. I asked some people, we shouldn\u2122t push if someone died, we had to stay in same place where he died. They could say, \ufb01Get them in. Get them out.\ufb02 But, they asked people to push my father and they attended me, and pushed him in Block 25, and my father was dead. I saw all the lice getting off his head from him. I knew that my father\u2122s dead. He shared the same fate with six million Jews. My father had 45 years, 45 years. He was a good man. He was not religious, but good, respected, respectful, a good person, but he died because he was a Jew with 45 years. I had about 17. My father, the cremat orium in Flossenb\u00fcrg didn\u2122t work anymore. He was burned outside the camp, outside near 25 th block, quarantine in Flossenb\u00fcrg. He was burned out there and I saw it. A few days later, I was taken to be drown in south Germany in Bodensee, to be drowned because came a cable from Himmler to Flossenb\u00fcrg. My boat, I rowed a boat and I have the facsimile in Portuguese of course, and they said that no prisoner should fall in th e hands of the Allies, and I was there to be killed. In the meantime, it was there. I di dn\u2122t know where I was. We were bumped. I don\u2122t know by the English or Americans, and at night we had to get out of the train, and at night we were taken to another train to go on, and in the meantime we stopped in Offenburg. This town was bombed, and we had to clean it, but a few time, a little time, they take me in the train where we were bombe d, as I said. And we went in this town of Tutlingen. We went into Tutlingen at night. I don\u2122t know how \u0152 why, I mean I don\u2122t know why, the train started to move, and we stopped in another train \u0152 another station called Emmendingen, and at Emmendingen, I was dying. I was sittin\u2122 there. I knew I was dying, and I was in peace with myself. \ufb01I\u2122m going to die.\ufb02 I knew it. I didn\u2122t feel no fear. I didn\u2122t fear anymore. I didn\u2122t hurt. Pain, just a little in my feet, because they were swollen, but I was sitting there in the train, they came up, and I heard outside some shooting and then lights, but it wasn\u2122t at me. I stood there. I was there with my, they call a blanket, and I was tired. Came over to me a person, and spoke in some language I don\u2122t know, it was Greek, I don\u2122t know what they said, and came back with a \u0152 with some milk and gave it to me, but I couldn\u2122t lift my hand anymore. So, he pushed my head back, and put this milk in me. And, I have a son. He is a doctor. He is a doctor now. He said, Page 15 \ufb01Father, you had to die by that time.\ufb02 I weighed \u0152 my weight was 56 pounds with 17 years. I was dead. I was dying there, really dying. He said, \ufb01You had to die like that.\ufb02 I didn\u2122t eat. I don\u2122t know how long I didn\u2122t eat, and all this stuff. \u201aThe milk should kill you.\ufb02 But, I felt better. I got up. Got up, and they came Russians too said the Germans run away. We are free. We are free now.\ufb02 Bu t, for me, it was \u0152 I don\u2122t know. I didn\u2122t feel nothing. But, I went into a train where the Germans were before. I could sleep there. So, I lay down there, and the French. I was awake by French. They left us as we were when we \u0152 garbage, they ask nothing \u0152 what happened. Who we are, they knew, but they didn\u2122t ask, didn\u2122t bring food, didn\u2122t bring a doctor, didn\u2122t bring a nurse, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. We waited few days afterwards, they ca me back said they goi ng to retreat. Who wants to go with them can go, but they don\u2122t ha ve any trucks to take us. I couldn\u2122t go a yard. I couldn\u2122t go ten miles, twenty miles. So, I didn\u2122t get up. I was dead. The next day, the Germans came back, and I was taken with others who also couldn\u2122t go. We were taken to be shot. When we came in near wh ere they wanted to shoot us, there came a priest, a firer and two civilians, and said to \u0152 it was an officer \u0152 they told him, \ufb01If you kill these people and the French come back, we will be responsible for it.\ufb02 They did nothing. So, leave them because of us. And, they didn \u2122t say it\u2122s not allowed to kill. They gave him a reason why because they will be responsible. They took us in the school, and afterwards they were shooting and when we got out there were white flags and there was bread the second time. Sixty years ago, last year, was January 2004, I went to Germany, Poland and Germany, to see all this I\u2122m telling you. All this, I saw it again, and I went to Emmendingen and spoke to the mayor of the city Emmendingen, and he has it all written down with dates. I don\u2122t know dates, but he did. I\u2122ve got it home in Brazil. I have it written down all this. I read a book and I showed him what \u0152 this is this but without dates, and it\u2122s exactly the same."
