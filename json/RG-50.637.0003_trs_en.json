            "question": "Could you tell me a little bit about where did you live in Lodz before the war? What did your father do? What did your mother do? Just a little bit about how well-off you were or poor or what was your life like?",
            "answer": "I was born in a Jewish \u2014 a Jewish family, full of love. I was the only child. My mother, my real mother died. I was about three or four years old, and my father remarried. My mother was Sima, Sima Cale also, and my father remarried and her name was Balcie, and today when I think of my mother, I think of Balcie. She was a person extraordinary and gave her life for me during the ghetto and afterwards. I don\u2019t speak afterwards about it. My father worked at the wholesale meat delivery Goscinny Dwor in Lodz. My mother took part in home work. She did work, and we were a family, a happy family. We were not Page | rich, but we were not poor. The party in Poland, Polish Jews were very, very poor people, and we were considered rich people. We were not rich, but we were considered rich, and it was a family, a happy family. I went to school, public school. I wasn\u2019t the best student. I wasn\u2019t the worst. I wasn\u2019t the best, and so that\u2019s life got till 1939, and then came the war, and everything changed by that time. The Germans \u2014 the Germans invaded Poland the third of September, and three days later, the Polish army left the city of Lodz. They came up, swastikas because in Lodz there were very many Germans, and they considered themselves as Germans, as Nazis, and three days later, exactly a week the war started. It was a Friday, and the next Friday the light went on and we saw that we had lost. They made some to know what\u2019s going on. In the streets they put on a \u2014 what do you call it \u2014 announcements what\u2019s going to happen. So, I went to see. I was 12 years old. I went to see what happened, and it was written like this, \u201cTomorrow\u201d at that time \u201cthe German Army is going to enter the city of Lodz, and who make any sabotage or something like it will be killed.\u201d Just that, \u201cWill be killed,\u201d and I was a child of 12 years complete. I had 12 years when it all started. And, it was the orneriest thing. The first thing I met the Nazis, say \u201cGoing to be killed.\u201d It was such a shock to me that I came home crying and told my father, \u201cThey\u2019re going to kill us.\u201d My father said, \u201cNo, people don\u2019t kill people. They\u2019re doing it because we were in the war and they\u2019re afraid that it\u2019s going to happen, something to them. So, they say going to kill, but no one kills nobody.\u201d My father didn\u2019t believe what is going to happen here. Nobody believed it. And, tomorrow, I went to see the German army to get in our city. I was very surprised. It was all motorized and it was very good looking, but the same day they took people, Jews in the street and hanged them. You could get there in the street and see five, six people hanging. They took Jews. Jews by that time used the beard. My grandfather also, he was very religious. My grandfather was. He wasn\u2019t, but my father \u2014 my grandfather was very religious. And, they catched him and pulled out his face, never recovered, they pulled out his beard and he never recovered. He was taken out after awhile before the ghetto, and he just disappeared. That was the entry of the German army, the Wehrmacht, the SS in our city. Schools closed, and it was all \u2014 we didn\u2019t know what to do, but we were \u2014 we had to use stars, yellow stars of David. We couldn\u2019t get into some cities. They changed the name for Hitler and so on. We couldn\u2019t walk on the sidewalk. You had to walk in the middle of the streets. The Jews couldn\u2019t go in movie or streetcars. We had to go to be separated. We had to eat. In Poland, it gets very cold about \u2014 very, very cold. We had to eat. So, my father was afraid. They took people, Jews, took them and they said it\u2019s going to work, but there\u2019s no work. They make these big ditches, and people had to undress, put it in, and dance over it and sing, and the words were \u2014 very few came home after. So, my father was afraid to just disappear. My father was afraid to go out. So, I had to go in the line to buy bread. I went out about five o\u2019clock and four o\u2019clock in the morning. It was very cold, very cold, and eight o\u2019clock they came \u2014 German policemen because this district is called Warteland, and we were attached to the German Reich. So, we were ruled by German boss who came in German policeman, and usually, almost everyday, said, \u201cJuden rausse\u201d Jews, out of the line. I didn\u2019t need, by that time, a Star of David. So, it wasn\u2019t for me. It was just waiting, but most of the time, there was someone who recognized me and said that I\u2019m a Jew. I was thrown out, kicked out of the line, and came home crying and we didn\u2019t eat that time. I know \u2014 I feel it very much. I don\u2019t hate. I don\u2019t hate nor have hate in me, but I feel very, very much what they did to us. Page 2"

            "question": "In May 1940, the ghetto was sealed. Did you and your family, your parents and your grandparents, did you have to move from your apartment or where did you live? And, how did you feel about being in the ghetto?",
            "answer": "When they started to speak about the ghetto, I didn\u2019t know what it is. I asked my father what was the ghetto? And, he told me that in the dark ages there were ghettos, but afterwards couldn\u2019t get anymore, but he said, \u201cYou'll see. We\u2019ll be all with Jews and at least we have the Germans. We have the Germans. We know that they\u2019re our enemies, but at least we won\u2019t have the Poles to what they were doing with us and beat us up and so on.\u201d And-\u2014 we didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. So, I went in \u2014 we went in to the ghetto. I lived at Gesia, Gesia 7 apartment 8, and it was a good apartment. The house belonged to my grandfather. He was a very wealthy man. We were not, but he was. And, so we didn\u2019t have to move, but my father \u2014 my father worked I said in wholesale, retail/wholesale, and they called themselves grinszpan. So, I went \u2014 he send me because he was afraid to go. I went there and we brought one of the brothers, and he came to our house and lived with us for a while. Afterwards, I don\u2019t know how it was because I don\u2019t remember. He left the house. We had a big house, but they were \u2014 people who took part a way to place newcomers, we had to give up two rooms for people to live there. It was very \u2014 the ghetto had room about 25,000 people to be there. We squeezed in 165,000 people in the place. There\u2019s room for 25. It was terrible. People didn\u2019t know what to do. It was cold, also. The worst of all was the hunger. We didn\u2019t have no food. People started to die because we didn\u2019t have no food, and to say what is food it\u2019s so hard to say because nobody understands what food. You can eat something. It\u2019s okay, but if you don\u2019t have nothing to eat. You don\u2019t see your neighbor. You don\u2019t see your parents. One thinking, you think all one thing \u2014 eat, eat, eat and you have nothing to put in your mouth. People started to die, and all over the ghetto there were people with open eyes, and you looked at them and you thought, \u201cGive me some food and I will get up.\u201d But they were dead. The Germans said, \u201cIf you make shops and work, we\u2019ll give you what to do and we\u2019ll give you food.\u201d It was made in a short time, and they started to send me. To live, you need 2,400 calories daily. We received 200 calories. It\u2019s a fact that people were just who eat no more than 200 calories can live most eight months. I lived five years with 200 calories. I don\u2019t know how I ever survived. I don\u2019t know how."

            "answer": "We received a kilo \u2014 kilo 1s a two pounds, two pounds of bread. It was dark black and full of water inside. Two pounds for five days, and soup. They gave us some vegetables and they were old. It was nothing to eat, almost nothing. People died. That\u2019s why we died. And, that was \u2014 but, they permitted to make schools in ghetto. So, we had \u2014 they called them Juden Alteste. Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski, and he thought that he was the emperor of the ghetto, and this emperor opened schools. So, I went to school. It was, of course, to learn also, but the main thing was a soup. You received a soup day. It was not the \u2014 it\u2019s more water than vegetables, but it was a soup, and it\u2019s \u2014 I think it\u2019s one of the reasons that I survived too. My survival is also, I think, because the love I received at Page 3 home, and I never was beaten up to die. I never received a beaten up. They didn\u2019t beat me up. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here."

            "answer": "The teachers were the best teachers in the world. They did everything to teach us, and we did everything to learn. They were \u2014 so bad as we were, no food, empty stomachs and thats \u2014 they didn\u2019t understand what we say, but we did, and they didn\u2019t say what for. They all want to die, what for to teach them, but they did everything to teach us. Today, if I can speak, if I\u2019m a person, if I\u2019m a Jew, if I\u2019m Brazilian, I belong to humanity, it\u2019s thanks to that teachers. In school, we had \u2014 I had some friends. I remember some names, other I don\u2019t. It\u2019s 65 years, okay? \u2019'm 77 years old now, but I still remember each time, but names I\u2019m very bad. There was a friend of mine. His name was Cukier, and I liked him very much. He was a friend, real good friend, and it\u2019s something \u2014 something I want to say. We had in the ghetto, they made \u2014 they made a \u2014 how do I say \u2014 we wrote to Rumkowski. He was the emperor, and we called the father. The father, it was not the father, but we had to do it. And, we made a writing for him to the end of the year, we made a writing for him, to him, and who should make it 1s exactly this Cukier, but he was so dirty. His hands were always dirty and I don\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t have no soap of course, but he was more dirty than other kids. So, he started to make it, and the principal said, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t make it. Who\u2019s going to make it is Laks, Cale I mean, and I made it, and I remember I made this writing to the Prezes. We call him Prezes."

They were told they were going to be changed for German prisoners of war from England.

Where are the ships here?\u201d There are no ships. And, a couple of elder people went into our apartment where we lived. There were two couples and I remember one of them had ten Marks, and she kept it \u2018til afterwards. I don\u2019t know how. I think they received \u2014 they had to go out of the ghetto and they were taken, of course, they were taken to Chelmno where all people died of the Wartegau, and these people also.

            "answer": "We don\u2019t spoke about it, a little, we spoke very little of it because before that, Germany invaded Russia, and they said that we\u2019re going to \u2014 who wants to go with them can go to Page 5 work in Russia. It\u2019s not hard work. They can go, children, the families, or just individuals, who wants to go to work is going to work in agricultural, it\u2019s not bad. See here you\u2019re dying, but there you can have a potato, grow potatoes and that, but you\u2019Il work, and it\u2019s very good job. Many people went out as volunteers. And two uncles of mine, my mother\u2019s two brothers went as volunteers. We know now that all those people went to Chelmno, but we didn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know. People just believed it. But, anyhow, we didn\u2019t have \u2014 we were not in touch anymore with them, and people started to wonder, \u201cWhy don\u2019t they write? What happens?\u201d So, the volunteers quit because nobody wanted. So, the made a sperre, gehsperre, also those people who went away, went into gehsperre. Nobody spoke about it because nobody knew where we were going, and that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t bother those people who went away also. I don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t spoke about it, but nobody wanted to get out. So, my father made a hiding. In Poland, if you come in, in the front of the house, you\u2019ve got doors, and each door means a room. If you hide one, you don\u2019t have any room. So, my father pushed a cupboard \u2014 my father pushed a cupboard in front of the door. So, when they came in there was nothing \u2014 there was no room \u2014 no door, no room. We went in the bottom of this cupboard and the other room we went in. If something happened in this room, we went in about 13 or 14 people in there. Who made it was my father. In the beginning, the Germans didn\u2019t know it, but afterwards they pushed the cupboards to see. They were not dumb also. So, looked \u2014 and they told us, \u2018\u201cWho\u2019s going to be in the hiding will be shot on the spot.\u201d They did. So, we went in there, and there came in a child \u2014 a child of three or four months in the same building. It was forbidden, but there was an exception. There was a child. And when they came in, they said that they will shoot, and we hear a shot. We have to go down there, and they\u2019 ll segregate who can stay together and who can not. Before that, they took out all the children, all the children of the ghetto. They took out and they said they\u2019re going to resettle, but all died in Chelmno. Then, by that time, they had children. They were going to take children 10 to 12 or 10, 12, and elder people, but they took others also. They had to have 5,000 a day, and if they would not have 5,000, they took other who could work. They didn\u2019t like it. They didn\u2019t have to. They never did what they said. And, they went in \u2014 this child went in with their father and mother, and all the time they came in and the child started to cry. So, this sperre, people started to cover the child with blankets and all was in his hand, and the child didn\u2019t cry anymore. We were in there \u2014 we didn\u2019t breathe. It was \u2014 it\u2019s something you can\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to say it what I felt there. I wasn\u2019t standing, didn\u2019t sit. Somebody sitting didn\u2019t stand up. We were afraid to breathe, they hear us breathe. I don\u2019t know how long it took. It took \u2014 every second was ten years, every minute was ten years. And, afterward, we heard outside crying and shoots, and then people were crying. Afterward, they went away, the child \u2014 the child was dead. My father make a mouth to mouth, but the child was dead. That time we weren\u2019t discovered, but at night those couple, the couple with the child went and gave themselves up to the Germans. It\u2019s something that marked me to the last day, I think \u2014 I won\u2019t say I lived, but \u2018til the last day, I\u2014 we be able to think."

I run away, went into a house, an empty house already, and there was another, my friend from school. Not but that time, but from school. We met there.

Did you like going there? Do you remember any names of teachers? What subjects did you learn?",
            "answer": "Yeah, I don\u2019t remember \u2014 that school before the ghetto was a public school. We had subjects, Polish was our language, my language by that time. It\u2019s not anymore, and mathematics, history which I liked very, very much, geography. I think that\u2019s all about. I don\u2019t think I had anymore. We were young. In school, I had good friends, not only Jews, but good friends, but some people were discriminated. Not too much, but sometimes they Page 7 said, \u201cOh, you\u2019re a Jew. You\u2019re a Jew. You\u2019re a Jew.\u201d But, I didn\u2019t feel it so much. The schools were very good, very good. The teachers \u2014 I don\u2019t remember any name of any teacher. I\u2019m very bad in names and dates, but I remember facts what happened. So, in school, most of all, afterward we went into the ghetto and they started the school in the beginning for a few months only, and we had almost the same subjects, but we had also Yiddish. We had Polish, German. I had a very good professor from a German university, and it was just beginning. Afterwards, they brought in Jews from all over Germany, but in the beginning, just the beginning they brought also Jews from Germany, also, just in the beginning, and I had one of those professors. He was a professor. He was a teacher. So, we had German, Yiddish, Polish sometimes, not anymore, but who want it \u2014 and history, geography, and some Hebrew also, some Hebrew who want it. I had very good teachers. They \u2014 I spoke about it. I had the best. No, this was afterwards, but I had very good teacher. All were very good teachers. So, and we were children. We were children and we wanted to eat and it was not so much about learning to eat the soup. It was good. It was to eat another soup, and my parents, of course, were happy that I ate another soup, and this was the school. We came home also in school, we had \u2014 we were not so cold. At home, it was very cold. So, I wanted to go to school not so much to learn, but to eat the soup and not to be frozen. That why. That\u2019s was the school, our school."

First of all, we were \u2014 there were fences, fences, and we couldn\u2019t go to the fences. There were some streets where the fences were people couldn\u2019t walk there. I lived near the fence, but didn\u2019t go out on the left side. I had to go always on the right side inside the ghetto to another property and not in the streets. So, we couldn\u2019t go in.

They came up to us, and said that we\u2019re going to Germany because the Russian army 1s near, and we\u2019ll be shooted by them as collaborators to the Germans because we\u2019re in ghetto, and they\u2019re going to help us not to be. So, they\u2019re going to take the ghetto as it is with machines and shops and all of us. You\u2019re going to Germany to be better in Germany. Each one will receive to go there, two pounds of bread, and there you\u2019ll have German money and that would going to be good for us to go. We didn\u2019t believe it. So, for two or three days, we were hidden too, my family were hidden. And my father said we\u2019re going to die here. Let\u2019s go. We\u2019re going to die. So, we gave ourselves up. We were taken to [unintelligible], not far away I lived before the war and in ghetto, and from there, we were taken to a place. I finished up in a place. We didn\u2019t know where we were. People in the meantime, I would like to say something also. That, today, people say that they didn\u2019t know what was going on. Well, when we left Poland, I mean ghetto Lodz, and went through to go there, there were people working in the fields, and there was a woman there. She made a cross and prayed for us. So, I said to my father, \u201cYou see people are praying for us.\u201d But, after the war, I remembered that. This woman, she knew where we going. She made a cross to death, that we were going to death. So, if she knew all the people who were over there knew too. If, they knew, the village also knew. If the village knew, also the city knew, and if the city knew, all of them knew. They knew and did nothing. But on the train, went on, and we came in, in a place. They said we had to go out. I want to tell a story also on that train. It was August, it was not so cold, and we became two pounds of bread, each one finished it in two minutes, and we wanted to have, to drink something. They didn\u2019t put in nothing. In the train I was, a young girl or man, we all were young, and started to cry, \u201cWater, water. I\u2019m dying. I want water, water, water, I\u2019m dying.\u201d There was no water. When the Germans came in, we had to give up all we had of value \u2014 gold, silver, furs, all of it, but in that train where I was, a man came up with a watch, a golden watch, and said to the \u2014 we had in all the trains we had a \u2014 there\u2019s a window and he said to he, \u201cTake this watch and bring water. A person\u2019s dying.\u201d He took the watch but didn\u2019t bring no water. The cries were weaker and weaker. I\u2019m sure that person died of thirst. The two things that marked me all my life \u2014 the child and that person. We came in \u2014 we came in. They opened up the \u2014 they were waiting there, and my father grabbed for my hand not to lose each other. He held me by my pulse and we jumped out the train. They said, \u201cWomen one side. Men down.\u201d I was with my father. My father asked they called Kanada, Sonederkommando Kanada, and my father said, \u201cWhere are we?\u201d He said, \u201cShut up. You\u2019re in Auschwitz. The only way out is the chimney.\u201d And, I thought, before we went out, I thought I\u2019m in the \u2014 where they make iron and steel and so, I saw chimney, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s a factory.\u201d But, when we came out, my father asked him and he said, \u201cShut up. Shut your mouth. You\u2019re in Auschwitz. The only way out is through the chimney.\u201d And, women went to one side. It was the last time I saw my mother, and my mother was very thin, and I want to tell about my mother. In ghetto, between one organization and the other we could go to a doctor, and the doctor gave or not the medicine. The medicine was Page 11 a few ounces of bread, and my mother became ill, and the doctor gave her. She didn\u2019t eat it. She brought it to me. I ate this bread. Was my stepmother. She was a mother. My mother was very thin, and she died. I looked for her after the war all over the world, all over the world \u2014 wrote Red Cross and all things because my mother died in the gas chamber in Auschwitz, in Birkenau. Right \u2018til now, I don\u2019t know how I survived, but I know what for. I survived to be a witness and to say all the world that can not happen again, never, never again. I do it in Brazil. I will apologize also for my English because I speak Portuguese, and Portuguese would be much better, but I hope people will understand, and never again."

In came another one, a friend of his, and said to him, \u201cCome I want to show you something.\u201d So, he said, \u201cWhat I going to do with this? I\u2019m going to finish him.\u201d He said, \u201cTake out, take another, you have so much what do you need him for.\u201d So, he went with him. He kicked me right here march zuruk. My father didn\u2019t believe that I came back. I think I was \u2014 I don\u2019t know why I survived. I was dying. He took me there to kill me, and Page 12 I came back. So, afterwards, we were sold as I said to another camp, and this camp of course belonged to Gross Rosen. The camp \u2014 the name of the camp was Kaltwasser, Kaltwasser. This camp was a little better because they didn\u2019t beat us. They did beat us, but not so much. At that camp, in the better camp, work was hard, and food was the same, but they didn\u2019t beat so much. The only thing they beat because it was cold and we were working with cement, and we took some paper to put in \u2014 it was so cold \u2014 to put enough in the feet, so cold. And each person who was catched with this at night, they\u2019d beat us up. We had numbers. We gave us numbers, also, but not tattooed, but we had on our clothes, and our uniforms, we had numbers. At that camp, they came once and took youngsters, I was in it, took youngsters to stay aside. They came out one of them. I think he was a dentist. He took me in, took me out of this bunch of where we were. Took me in their quarters, and pulled me out a tooth. He said, \u201cI\u2019m going to pull you out a tooth, and you may cry if you feel something to cry over, just go ahead. Nobody will hear you.\u201d Anyway, and without anesthetic, without nothing, he pulled out a tooth. I wanted to stay up. He said, \u201cSit down. And, now if you yell, don\u2019t breathe in because I\u2019m going to take out another tooth, and if you cry or something, I kill you right now.\u201d And, pulled me out another tooth, two teeth. I don\u2019t know why. From this one, it became five because I used a hook, and spoiled. I make implants to this side, and here I have a bridge. He took me out five from this side and three on this side, in that better camp, we made ditches, and it was raining so much that night. It was horrible, and the guards there were well guarded rubber. There was no plastics by that time. With rubber, they were dry, and he said, \u201cHey, Jew, bread.\u201d He said a little bread. I pulled out of the trench, and put this in my mouth. Other people saw something, I don\u2019t know how. I heard shooting, but people fell on me, and I was offered but the bread I had in my mouth. When they took out my beating, I don\u2019t know. I got out this same soldier, the same SS was near me, looking at me. I knew if I would run or something, he would kill me. So, I stood up, put my head down, couldn\u2019t look at the Germans. It was forbidden. So, I stood. He with his gun, he hit me here. It\u2019s still here. Until today, I don\u2019t breathe with this side. I breathe this side. This is Nazi. The name of the camp was Larche. These youngsters, I received a little time ago, I received from Poland a book who said exactly what I\u2019m \u2014 not about me, but about the youngsters that all these people who went \u2014 who were taken out of this camp, were sent back to Auschwitz and they all gone, all was exterminated in Auschwitz, and it was something. It was a blessing that he took me out and pulled my teeth out. If not, I would not be here. There\u2019s so many coincidences, but I think that God wanted me to be here. I think it\u2019s God. I don\u2019t know. Afterwards, we were taken out from Larche. It was Kaltwasser and Larche. When I was in Kaltwasser, we had to build Larche. And, we build Larche, and we belonged to a Gross Rosen. We were taken \u2014 they took us to death march, and at that time was almost end of the war. My father said to me, \u201cI want you to promise me son.\u201d I said, \u201cOf course, what do you want father?\u201d He said, \u201cTo see the war\u2019s going to end. The Germans look like the Polish Army in \u201839. One runs forward, the other runs back, and if they won\u2019t kill us, you will survive. And, I want you to do a thing. If you survive, never let people forget what happened to us. Always tell what happened. Maybe some people won\u2019t get out in their head that something so terrible could happen, but you always say and tell what happened, no matter \u2014 young, old, many, few \u2014 always say it.\u201d I promised my father I would. He said to me, \u201cNow, my child. I\u2019m going to sit down because my feet don\u2019t \u2014 can\u2019t go on anymore.\u201d And, to get out of the \u2014 to be to not Page 13 go or sit down, they killed. We went out from there, we went out 600 prisoners, and at the time, my father fell, we were about 50 or 60. They killed all of us. My father said, \u201cI\u2019m going to sit because my feet \u2014 my feet don\u2019t \u2014 over there.\u201d I said, \u201cFather, if you will sit down, I will sit down too. I don\u2019t want to live without you.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, you have to walk. You have to go. You have to survive because I don\u2019t want\u201d Anytime he mentioned to stop or something, I stopped with him, and near us, we were always in five. So, a person \u2014 I don\u2019t know who it is, he didn\u2019t survive. I\u2019m sure. He said, \u201c\u201cYou want your son to live.\u201d He said, \u201cOf course. The only thing, I\u2019m going to die. I\u2019m dying.\u201d \u201cSo, put your arm on me, and one arm on your son, and we\u2019 ll fall down all the three of us.\u201d He was in very bad shape too, but we fall down. My father said, \u201cThey\u2019ll shoot us. They don\u2019t allow it.\u201d He said, \u201cPut your arm \u2014 put your arm on us. Let\u2019s go.\u201d And, my father after he put one hand on his and one on my shoulder and we went, and it was a miracle. All of a sudden, we had a train from nowhere. There was a train, and our commandant went over to the man who was in it. There was nobody in it, just a train, just only the driver, and we went into this train, and we came to Flossenburg. In Flossenbiirg, we were in Block 25, in quarantine. It was one of the \u2014 the worst in Flossenbtrg, and the Kapo killed my father there because he went in and it was cold and my father couldn\u2019t go anymore. So, he went in and he call latrina, and in there he killed my father. I asked some people, we shouldn\u2019t push if someone died, we had to stay in same place where he died. They could say, \u201cGet them in. Get them out.\u201d But, they asked people to push my father and they attended me, and pushed him in Block 25, and my father was dead. I saw all the lice getting off his head from him. I knew that my father\u2019s dead. He shared the same fate with six million Jews. My father had 45 years, 45 years. He was a good man. He was not religious, but good, respected, respectful, a good person, but he died because he was a Jew with 45 years. I had about 17. My father, the crematorium in Flossenburg didn\u2019t work anymore. He was burned outside the camp, outside near 25\" block, quarantine in Flossenbiirg. He was burned out there and I saw it. A few days later, I was taken to be drown in south Germany in Bodensee, to be drowned because came a cable from Himmler to Flossenbirg. My boat, I rowed a boat and I have the facsimile in Portuguese of course, and they said that no prisoner should fall in the hands of the Allies, and I was there to be killed. In the meantime, it was there. I didn\u2019t know where I was. We were bumped. I don\u2019t know by the English or Americans, and at night we had to get out of the train, and at night we were taken to another train to go on, and in the meantime we stopped in Offenburg. This town was bombed, and we had to clean it, but a few time, a little time, they take me in the train where we were bombed, as I said. And we went in this town of Tutlingen. We went into Tutlingen at night. I don\u2019t know how \u2014 why, I mean I don\u2019t know why, the train started to move, and we stopped in another train \u2014 another station called Emmendingen, and at Emmendingen, I was dying. I was sittin\u2019 there. I knew I was dying, and I was in peace with myself. \u201cI\u2019m going to die.\u201d I knew it. I didn\u2019t feel no fear. I didn\u2019t fear anymore. I didn\u2019t hurt. Pain, just a little in my feet, because they were swollen, but I was sitting there in the train, they came up, and I heard outside some shooting and then lights, but it wasn\u2019t at me. I stood there. I was there with my, they call a blanket, and I was tired. Came over to me a person, and spoke in some language I don\u2019t know, it was Greek, I don\u2019t know what they said, and came back with a \u2014 with some milk and gave it to me, but I couldn\u2019t lift my hand anymore. So, he pushed my head back, and put this milk in me. And, I have a son. He 1s a doctor. He is a doctor now. He said, Page 14 \u2018Father, you had to die by that time.\u201d I weighed \u2014 my weight was 56 pounds with 17 years. I was dead. I was dying there, really dying. He said, \u201cYou had to die like that.\u201d I didn\u2019t eat. I don\u2019t know how long I didn\u2019t eat, and all this stuff. \u2018The milk should kill you.\u201d But, I felt better. I got up. Got up, and they came Russians too said the Germans run away. We are free. We are free now.\u201d But, for me, it was \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t feel nothing. But, I went into a train where the Germans were before. I could sleep there. So, I lay down there, and the French. I was awake by French. They left us as we were when we \u2014 garbage, they ask nothing \u2014 what happened. Who we are, they knew, but they didn\u2019t ask, didn\u2019t bring food, didn\u2019t bring a doctor, didn\u2019t bring a nurse, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. We waited few days afterwards, they came back said they going to retreat. Who wants to go with them can go, but they don\u2019t have any trucks to take us. I couldn\u2019t go a yard. I couldn\u2019t go ten miles, twenty miles. So, I didn\u2019t get up. I was dead. The next day, the Germans came back, and I was taken with others who also couldn\u2019t go. We were taken to be shot. When we came in near where they wanted to shoot us, there came a priest, a firer and two civilians, and said to \u2014 1t was an officer \u2014 they told him, \u201cIf you kill these people and the French come back, we will be responsible for it.\u201d They did nothing. So, leave them because of us. And, they didn\u2019t say it\u2019s not allowed to kill. They gave him a reason why because they will be responsible. They took us in the school, and afterwards they were shooting and when we got out there were white flags and there was bread the second time. Sixty years ago, last year, was January 2004, I went to Germany, Poland and Germany, to see all this I\u2019m telling you. All this, I saw it again, and I went to Emmendingen and spoke to the mayor of the city Emmendingen, and he has it all written down with dates. I don\u2019t know dates, but he did. I\u2019ve got it home in Brazil. I have it written down all this. I read a book and I showed him what \u2014 this is this but without dates, and it\u2019s exactly the same."

I\u2019m sure nobody lives anymore, but I found my signature in here, and all those are my friends. They all live in me, all live in me, and I am here.

I don\u2019t know whether 21 or 19. The building is still there, but we were a class, our class of children, and I was the head. I was the best. Of course, I wasn\u2019t the best student, but for some reason they picked me out to be the head. And, by that time, there was a German \u2014 I don\u2019t remember his name \u2014 he took pictures in 1940 pictures, colored pictures, and I am in that picture. That\u2019s me over here. That\u2019s me. That picture, that\u2019s me."

In 2004, I was back to see it, and the building\u2019s just the same, and here I am, here. Also, it made the \u2014 I don\u2019t know for the some reason \u2014 this little boy here, my friend of course, I don\u2019t know who itt is. He has a hat from a Jewish policeman. It\u2019s something. I don\u2019t know why. Also, my friends have stars, yellow Stars of David, but I don\u2019t have a star. I don\u2019t have a star because I was not 12 years old by that time."
