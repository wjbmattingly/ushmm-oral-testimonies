What \u0152 what \u0152 one of the difficulties we had was that it was staffed Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 51 by what we called cadre, c-a-d-r-e , cadre. These are old -time army men who have been through the wars. And here was a bunch of young, college, smart -aleck kids coming down. They were not going to let us get away with an easy training period. Training was three months. They gave us the most difficult forced marches. One of the \u0152 one of the ultimate requirements was that we march, fully loaded with equipment, backpacks, and all \u0152 all th \u0152 and all the \u0152 the equipment that we would normally carry into battle. And we ru \u0152 march over Bain Gap . Bain Gap was a very, very hilly mountain. And some had trouble making it. Certainly in the \u0152 in the hot temperatures in which we were marching. We did it. I think just not everybody made \u0152 made the march. That irritated them, and they said, you\u2122re going back, you\u2122re going to do it again. And they made us march over Bain Gap , twice."

But because we all made it, they \u0152 you know, thi -this was emotional, more \u0152 more than tactical. So, you got to march again, so we had to go over it again. The obstacle courses they set up for us, were very, very difficult. Yeah, you\u2122re climbing walls out of \u0152 you \u0152 you Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 52 run, cl \u0152 pull yourself on a rope, and go over. And jump over ponds, and you had to jump far enough, otherwise you landed in the water. Rather tough exercises. So they put us through a very strenuous program. I believe at that time I \u0152 oh, I \u0152 I was a physical en -enthusiast. I took the Charles Atlas bodybuilding course, because I was very small, and I had to build up \u0152 if I was small \u0152 I may be small in stature, but I will not be small in body and strength. So I took the Charles Atlas bodybuilding course, which was very popular at that time. So I had some things going for me already. That, plus the training that we got at Fort McClella n, I \u0152 I think, to a large extent, saved my life later \u0152 later on. One of the difficult things that also happened at Fort McClellan , is that it was a \u0152 a \u0152 it was a cu \u0152 a prisoner of war camp for German soldiers. And I didn\u2122t know, but they apparently, when they were captured overseas, some of them were sent over here, to s \u0152 to POW camps. Fort McClellan was a POW camp. Now, their treatment of prisoners \u0152 our treatment of prisoners, I should say, as opposed to theirs, very, very different. They \u0152 as we were marching on the -these \u0152 these tough \u0152 these obstacle courses, the marches, they would stand in the fenced -in area, laughing at us, because we were being \u0152 we were the ones who were being pushed, and they were living a \u0152 a wonderful life. They were bronze d. You know, they had no shirts, and they were absorbing the sun. They didn\u2122t have to march in the sun, they just absorbed it. They had the rights to go to Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 53 the post exchange, where they could get cigarettes, candy, any \u0152 anything that was available. They w ere living wonderful lives, and there they were, ridiculing us, and laughing \u0152 laughing at us. And so in \u0152 as I write, later on, I say, hm, but look at how things turned out. The guy they were laughing at, turns out to have survived, and many of them, I\u2122m sure, did not. That was compensation. So Fort McClellan , again, was very difficult, but it did prepare us well for what lie ahead, and \u0152 lay ahead. And then, after three months \u0152"

The heat was so great, that it was not uncommon for people to pass out on the parade ground, when we were being marched, and all Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 54 that.

And I \u0152 I felt weakness, and I \u0152 I just didn\u2122t want to drop out. I remember getting to the barracks, to the steps, and fine \u0152 just about making the few steps I had to my bed, and then throwing myself on my bed.

Now you have gas masks, rifles on \u0152 on your \u0152 on your shoulders, and on your back. And so this is \u0152 this is combat. The treacherous part of that trip was the exchange you made from the liberty ship, down to the LST , because you had to climb down on a n et. And we were warned in advance, one false step, and it may mean your life. So you had to place each foot perfectly. We had about 30 pounds of Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 65 equipment on our backs; rifles, gas masks, everything we would carry into battle. So, you had to si \u0152 watch your step. I was very, very careful. Some did not make it. I heard stories about many on DDay who slipped and fell between the ships. Now, the little ship is bobbing, and there \u0152 the two ships are crashing together. Some were crushed before they ever even got to shore. So I climbed down cautiously, and got into the ship.

And those shells come over. It\u2122s a frightening feeling, but I still \u0152 still, it didn\u2122t register on me yet, because they \u0152 they passed over \u0152 t he ones you hear are okay, the \u0152 you know, they pass \u0152 they passed you. The ones that hit you are the ones you don\u2122t hear.

An yway, those shells were passing overhead. We had a ca \u0152 a few in our half -track who had fought in the north African campaign , they were used to this. And they knew when shells come in, that\u2122s dangerous. And they jumped \u0152 dropped to the floor, and I \u0152 I loo ked, and I wondered why. Well, th -they \u0152 they knew what \u0152 the seriousness of it. I still didn\u2122t know. We \u0152 there were some German soldiers came out of the woods, they were gi -gi-giving up, with their hands up, threw their rifles away. And we had a machine -gunner on our vehicle who was firing at them. And I yelled, we all yelled, stop, stop, they\u2122re surrendering. And so other troops, other American troops came by, took them away, and we continued the \u0152 the \u0152 we were a -aapproaching enemy terri -territory, and shells started to come in. The last place you want to be in a half -track is on a road that\u2122s zeroed in by en -enemy heavy artillery. And so we pulled it off the road. Now, we\u2122re off the road, but we\u2122re still being shelled. We sought cover. I jumped out of the half -track, because we were targets in there, no \u0152 no \u0152 no roof. And I \u0152 I jumped be \u0152 on the be \u0152 and I lay down on the back end of that. Some of the other fellows were in the front. I waved to them, there in the front, looking back toward us, under \u0152 under the front axle of the vehicle. And they\u2122re looking \u0152 and I\u2122m waving, they\u2122re not waving back. And again, I still hadn\u2122t gotten the reality of warfare. This is very, very serious business. And then I see them Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 69 taking stretchers, some of our men had been hit. It begins to have an effect, I said, you know, this is a \u0152 a serious business. The next morning, I found out how serious it was. We \u0152 we pulled into a field, there were tanks, and there are half -tracks, and we were told to dig in. Mean, you \u0152 you b uild a bu \u0152 you dig a bunker. I was still not oriented yet to military life. I was a defiant, young, 21 year old, and ah, bunker. You know, we\u2122 ll be moving on, and all the \u0152 all the effort of going through a bunker. I didn\u2122t dig a bunker. Shellfire is in the morning, early. We call it incoming mail. The enemy always strikes at dawn. Incoming mail, those are the bombs are \u0152 these \u0152 these shells are \u0152 are landing. All of a sudden, my rifle is blown out of my hand, my hand stings. I look at my rifle lying on the ground, there\u2122s a hole in the \u0152 in the ba \u0152 in the barrel of the rifle.

And they had tremendous, heavy artillery. Their tank corps were probably superior to the American. And so I th \u0152 I believe that our top command expected that, but nevertheless, the \u0152 the magnitude of the attack was just overpowering. The company that I had trained with, the 106 th infantry division, in the U.S., on that first day of battle, lost 75 percent of its troops, killed, wounded or captured, or missing. Seventy -five percent in one day. The word was that that division that I trained with \u0152 and I left early, to be shipped over as a replacement, they were not ready yet for combat. They were green. And you read the accounts of \u0152 of \u0152 of that unit, the 106 th infantry division, and you realize how poo rly prepared they were. They were scattered, they ran in all directions. Some of them shot their own men. They were just firing at anything they saw. They were such in \u0152 in that kind of disarray. And I hate to think about that with an American unit, particularly one that I trained with. But nevertheless, the Germans were well -equipped, well trained, well prepared, and they \u0152 they \u0152 and Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 78 then they \u0152 they drove in -into us. The report that I read later on, when I was reported missing in action, was that the unit I was with had been subjected to heavy enemy fire. And in the process, troops were scattered, and got lost.

When you tally up your troops afterward, you say, this guy\u2122s missing. They had no idea what happened to me. We had been fighting, the German attacked, and I was with the unit, I was on the line, I was fighting. We were face to face with the enemy, we were fi -fighting. And then I and others were \u0152 were ordered back behind the lines, because this had been going on for days, and I was weary. So yeah, they figured the troops need some rest, go back behind the lines , get some rest, get some food, and then you\u2122ll resume later on. So when I got behind \u0152 behind the lines, I was now with all allied forces, the ger \u0152 Germans were far removed, I heard somebody say, we need volunteers. We\u2122ve lost radio contact. The Germans have apparently knocked out our radio contact with front line troops. So we have to establish where our \u0152 our lines are. We need vala \u0152 volunteers to do that. I was still 21, I think, so I was young, and adventurous. I\u2122d Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 79 just begun to learn what war was about. But I also felt that it was a mission. Something moved me, and \u0152 and I said, yeah. So I\u2122ll vol \u0152 I\u2122ll volunteer. I saw a Jeep in the di \u0152 in the distance, and I said, I\u2122ll get that Jeep . And I signaled to five others, and they joined me. We said, we \u0152 we \u0152 we\u2122ll be a volunteer task force, we\u2122ll go as far as we can go, and see if we can identify where our lines are. High command cannot pri \u0152 plan strategy, unless they know where the lines are. So, that\u2122s what we started out to do. So, we\u2122re in this Jeep , it\u2122s now \u0152 the vision is not very clear, it\u2122s an overcast sky. I remember driving the Jeep , the roads are covered with i \u0152 snow and ice. We round a curve, and just about \u0152 maybe about 10 to 15 yards ahead of me, there\u2122s a German 88 millimeter cannon pointed right at the Jeep , right at us. And it\u2122s mounted on an 80 \u0152 on a \u0152 a \u0152 a German ta -tank. And so, you know, anybody pulled that trigger, we were gone. And I can talk, and I do talk man \u0152 many, many times, the number of times that you are exposed to killing, to being killed, and that was \u0152 that was one of them, and there were many, many others. So it\u2122s, you know, miracles take place, and you don\u2122t get killed. But that was one that they certainly \u0152 somebody should have pulled the trigger, and we would have been gone. They didn\u2122t. I jammed on the brakes, we skidded off the road. All of a sudden, fire from rifles \u0152 apparently mi \u0152 rifles and machine -guns , small a rm fire, is pouring in from our right. And we \u0152 none of us were hit immediately. I \u0152 I say, we Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 80 have to \u0152 we have to defend ourselves yet. Have to find something, we can\u2122t do it from the Jeep here. We see a shack across the road, and I say, we move toward t hat shack. We did. One of the men had the perception to real -realize, we go near the machine -gun \u0152 s ome \u0152 somebody\u2122s firing a lot of \u0152 lot of ri -rifle fire at us, or machine -gun fire. So he too \u0152 he detached the one from the Jeep , and brought that with us. So we start racing for the shack. One of our men is hit and killed on the way over. We get to the shack, and the enemy fire is still pouring in. We have to set up the machine -gun, some way, to fire back. And so there\u2122s a big bay window in the shack. The m an who took the machine -gun, I think it was him, he sets it up in the window, and he starts firing. Within maybe a minute or so, he\u2122s hit, and he\u2122s \u0152 he\u2122s killed. When I talk to student groups, I \u0152 I say sometimes people \u0152 un-understand, you do things unde r battlefield conditions, you do things you would not normally do, because you do it on your instinct. Something tells you that you have to take \u0152 you have to do something right now. So, my instinct, without thinking about the consequences, I was wide open, I would be killed just like the other man was, your instinct is a \u0152 is a \u0152 jump behind that gun. Which is what I did, and I started firing . And I fired the machine gun at everything I saw move. I hit some, probably killed a number of their men. And that went on \u0152 that had started early in the morning \u0152 that went on until late in the afternoon, we\u2122re running out of fire. We didn\u2122t \u0152 we had no Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 81 idea what we were against, at the time. I learned later on that there were at least a hundred \u0152 somewhere between a hundred and 200 si \u0152 over there, dug in, in foxholes. And we were \u0152 we started out with six of us, one was killed immediately, so there were five of us, fighting them, and for a good part of the day. That machine -gun really kept us going. When we ran low on ammunition, we had to devise some strategy, how do we get out of this? We had two wounded. There was another window, so two a \u0152 two of them were hit. I \u0152 I looked, and I saw a trap door in the floor of this shack, meaning there must be a cellar beneath. So the strategy was simply this; we had to make them believe that they killed us off, or that we \u0152 we \u0152 we took off toward our \u0152 our rank, toward our \u0152 our la \u0152 our American and our British lines. And so, I figure, we\u2122ll climb down into this cellar, and then when it\u2122s dark, under cover of darkness, we\u2122ll emerge. If we can take those two wounded, we will certainly do that, we certainly wanted to do that. And we \u0152 so that was the \u0152 that was the idea. We would infiltrate through their lines at night, under co ver of darkness, we possibly could do that."

Of about \u0152 I \u0152 I don\u2122t know, it was about a half hour or so \u0152 no way to measur e time, but I figured somewhere around there, I push open that trap door, maybe we could come out now, maybe it\u2122s dark now, and what I saw \u0152 and I always tell people when I \u0152 when I talk to them, there\u2122s some things in battle, in combat, or captivity, that you don\u2122t remember, that you block out, and some of them are blocked out of your mind.

He knew, and he knew that I knew, in the POW camp, you don\u2122t have to fight any more, you get shelter, food, good treatment. They did \u0152 I\u2122m quite certain \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I know this, that they \u0152 they did follow the Geneva con \u0152 the rules of the Geneva convention, and if I did go back to a prisoner of war camp, that I would not have to fight any more. And that was his way of ex \u0152 of recognizing gallantry. And he said \u0152 he went on to say \u0152 he says, we had many more men than you, but you fo ught well. And as I said, how \u0152 I didn\u2122t think right at the moment, but later on when I \u0152 when I thought back about that, what gallantry. You know, here\u2122s a German soldier, my archenemy, and he\u2122s going to save my life, because he understood and Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 89 appreciated the way we fought against these extreme odds. And he said, you killed many of our men, but you fought well. And so he \u0152 he, in earnest, was about to save my life. He orders over two guards to take me away. As they do, there\u2122s \u0152 we\u2122re stopped along the way , and I can look \u0152 I can see by the things on the man\u2122s shoulder, or wherever they were, that he\u2122s an officer. And there\u2122s a German conversation that goes on. I don\u2122t know what the conversation is, but I soon recognize what it was. No, I\u2122m not going to a prisoner of war camp, they don\u2122t take prisoners any more, I\u2122m going to become a slave laborer. Because one of the things that they needed \u0152 and there were ma -many, a -as you well know, non -military men who are forced into slave labor. And slave labor in many of the camps, existed. Anyway, that\u2122s what I\u2122m going to be."

I take it off, I don\u2122t want them to see it, so I throw it over a hedge, or some kind of a bush. The only winter garment I have is a scarf. I take the scarf from around my neck, and I wrap it around the foot. So I have one shoe and one scarf, and that\u2122s the way I conduct myself the rest of the time that I was a prisoner."

The \u0152 we had no \u0152 no bathroom facilities, we used Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 107 our helmets. You can guess what the atmosphere was like in that car, 80 humans.

I only have one shoe, and I can\u2122t endure another march, certainly on sn ow and ice. I have to make a decision. I always knew that one option was escape, if a time or situation presented itself. And I said, this is it. We were being \u0152 we were put in \u0152 in lines for forced march . I looked and sa w where the guards were positioned, here, here, so forth. It occurred to me that if we came to a curve in the road, there would be maybe five to 10 seconds where we would be \u0152 not be vi \u0152 we, where we were situated, would not be visible to a guard. There were two others near me. I don\u2122t recall that I had any particular connection with them at all, but they were the nearest to me.

I think the troops behind us, recognizing what we did, used discretion, and said, I should clo \u0152 we should close up. They closed ranks, I think. I\u2122m not sure of that. But the fact that we were not detected, that there were no soldiers out searching for us, suggested to me that maybe that\u2122s what happened. And that saved us. So they marched on by, and they were gone. We had gone through a town while we were on the train, not too long ago.

She sees our condition, and almost without saying anything, she goes, I guess, to the kitchen, and she comes out with three ladles of so \u0152 ladles and some \u0152 some kind of cups of some sort, of hot soup, with a piece of meat in it. Perception on her part, she sees the condition, and she recognizes, more than anything. To us, just seeing a living quarters, it was so startling. I re \u0152 I remember just \u0152 just standing there, even before taking the food, and just looking. There were curtains, drapes, carpeting, furniture, lamps. We Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 112 hadn\u2122t seen that in a long time, we were living just in the outdoors alone. So that was striking.

But I \u0152 I savored it, just the taste of food, was so great. After they fed us, we talk ed for a little bit. Amazingly, they spoke reasonable English. Why did they want to save us? Some years earlier, this couple had traveled to America . They spent time in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . Their experience with Americans, and America , was so good, when he saw that emblem, that\u2122s what made him smile. And that\u2122s what probably \u0152 probably got them to take the risk of bringing us into their home, and take \u0152 and take \u0152 you know, and feeding us. After that experience, they then knew that they couldn\u2122t keep us there. They got a piece of paper, and they drew a map, showing us alleyways to go through. We could hear shellfire, not \u0152 not small arms fire yet, but we knew we were fairly close to allied lines. And they knew too, that the allies were near. So, if they could get us to a safe place, they thought that in a few days, the way the allies were moving, from reports they had, I guess, heard, or whatever, we would be rescued."

And I knew something, because I did read newspapers, did know about the war, and about concentration camps, and things of that nature, and a little bit of politics. But \u0152 but I was really very, very unsophisticated, and had no particular design on life, I didn\u2122t know wha -what I wanted to be. So, very unsettled, I was still a student, and that was \u0152 that was all. My Jewish life was pretty much set by my mother, so I knew I had to go to synagogue, even though it was done in extreme form, like a Orthodoxy, and all that. But my shi \u0152 but my mother insisted, and I was brought up, you know, as a \u0152 as a good Jew. But when I \u0152 af -after going through what I did, I don\u2122t know what the maturation design was, but when I lie in \u0152 in the hospital bed for those 10 months, I had many sleepless nights. Now, a lot of them were because of physical conditions, and the pain was such that it was hard to sleep. But the others were just emotional, I \u0152 just thinking, thinking, thinking, constantly. Some of that thinking would go back to incidents that took place during the war. I constantly had an image of this elderly couple. I had an image of the helmet of that sergeant, and I kept reaching for \u0152 trying to \u0152 trying to get his face. And I couldn\u2122t \u0152 couldn\u2122t \u0152 couldn\u2122t get aw ay from \u0152 from remembering that, and Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 135 what \u0152 what \u0152 what I went through with him, and how \u0152 and the great good fortune that I had, that it happened to be somebody like that , who was a humanitarian, as \u0152 as \u0152 a-aas well as a \u0152 a good soldier, I guess, and you know. He recognized valor, aand so, I \u0152 I had thoughts about them, and some of the instances, sometimes I would get an image of that tank, like an ogre, a big monster, with that cannon. But more \u0152 more often though, my thinking was about the future \u0152 wha \u0152 wa \u0152 what ha \u0152 how \u0152 how \u0152 how \u0152 wha -wha twhat i \u0152 what i s ordained, what am I supposed to do? I mean, it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s going to be a total change. Sure, I\u2122m gonna go back to school, then I have to go to work, and all of that. But my life, somehow, it just feels very, very different. I\u2122m not the person I was before. I\u2122m much more mature, for one thing. I was a kid when I went in, now I\u2122m reasonably mature, and I start to think. I was very, very lucky, as \u0152 as when I \u0152 when I talk to senior audiences, very often men will come up and surround me, and say, your life was a miracle. You \u0152 you should have been killed many, many times, but you\u2122re still here. So that \u0152 that thought ran through my head, and there was something urging me inside. I \u0152 I don\u2122t know what it \u0152 I don\u2122t know what it was, but I \u0152 I knew I had to respond in some way, to what I had been through. And that some way hap pened to turn out to devoting the rest of my life to Jewish causes, Jewish interests. When I was 83, I had my second Bar Mitzvah, which is in the book, incidentally, my second Bar Mitzvah, Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 136 how that \u0152 how that came about.

And that had a lot of meaning, because when I was 13, in Reform congregation, we didn\u2122t \u0152 the boy didn\u2122t read from the Torah. This was my first opportunity to do that. So I learned to read Hebrew without the vowels underneath, a nd you had \u0152 were either experience d, or were very adept at learning how to do it. And I did learn.

I knew things about Jewish life, and Jewish philanthropy, that I learned only late \u0152 later on. I didn\u2122t know as a \u0152 a youngster, and maybe I never would have come across it. The fact that I became president of Hillel , a Jewish international organization, did help me a great deal, in understanding that a Jewish life is important, and saving j \u0152 other Jewish lives is important, too. So, when it came time to set up different type of operations, I set up \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 congregational life was \u0152 was important. I sat on a number of different boards. I did fundraising for United Jewish Appeal, because that money went not just to people in need, an -an -and in many ca \u0152 in some cases, not even to just Jewish causes, cause many of the things that we did as Jews, went for the public at large. Many of our operations are required even by statute in the state, to serve other people\u2122s needs. Jewish family service, Jewish vocational service. Social service Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 140 agencies like that do provide services to people who are not Jewish. So, that was what I was committed.

You know, travel, go see your grandkids, take vacations, things of that nature. Those are the golden years. But I saw people in housing, senior housing in New Jersey . They were not Jewish, just Jewish based. These were people who had gi ven up on life. I developed a program that would hand \u0152 may enable them to re -reengage with life, reinstitute things that they had done earlier in their lives. Some had been great cooks, some had worked in the industry, some had been musicians, and all that. But now, you\u2122re over 65, so you stop doing all of that, and in the process, you lose the essence of life. You still have some years ahead. And so I wrote this program out, and my par -partner, he and \u0152 he had access to people who would fund it . We got th e funding, developed. That was a non -profit corporation. We didn\u2122t charge for the services. We went throughout New Jersey , to homes for the aged. The experience was not lectures, I didn\u2122t lecture to them, but there were big charts they had on the wall. And each of them would go to their chart, and they would plot out \u0152 I would le \u0152 give them leading questions, what were you \u0152 and they \u0152 and those questions brought out their interests in life. What things that they did before. Some of them were musicians, they gave that up, some were great -aunts and uncle \u0152 whatev \u0152 but whatever it was that they were interested in life, some were great cooks. Whatever Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 142 they did, which they were doing no more. So they plotted that out. And I \u0152 I go \u0152 guided them through that. A nd many of them adopted new careers, absolutely careers. The most \u0152 probably the most dynamic one in all of them was a Holocaust survivor in a home for the elderly in Cranford , New Jersey .

But I learned, through reconstructionist Judaism, when \u0152 when I decided we wanted to go that route, and I took a whole group, and we formed a new congregation, I learned that there\u2122s a spark of God \u0152 when we are created, all of us, all the human being, there\u2122s a spark of God in each Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 144 of us. And you can do something one way or another, with that spark. And I\u2122ve always looked to that spark. Now, that wasn\u2122t during \u0152 during the war, because I had not been exposed to reconstructionist Judaism yet, and I \u0152 I didn\u2122t know about that. But I did appeal to some something, beyond mankind. I didn\u2122t know what the force was. I didn\u2122t think I had the right to talk directly to God, but I appealed for some kind of help, support. And then, as I got to know later on, then I \u0152 I \u0152 I reali \u0152 but in the hospital, there was a moving force. I could never identify what it was, something with \u0152 inside me, it\u2122s a quality, a character \u0152 each person has some kind of character within him. It was a character in me, I think it might have been an essence of guilt. The fact that I came through. Not the fact that I sacrificed so much with the danger, and the torture of living as I did, and all that, but a feeling of maybe guilt, that I \u0152 I \u0152 I was blessed. There are a lot of people in life that are going through torment in their lives. May not be what I went through, but it may be the loss of a family member, it may be a \u0152 a sickness, that your \u0152 your \u0152 you\u2122re confined to. Whatever it is.

I \u0152 I\u2122m not that \u0152 that kind of a person. To me there must be purpose. And I think that was a word that would describe most anything. There\u2122s a purpose in life, and I have to find what that purpose is, and always fulfill that purpose.

Here is the first paragraph of the letter: Dear Corporal Max , I\u2122m very happy to report that your brother, PFC Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 149 Robert R . Max , ASN 15311529, was liberated by our advancing forces, from a ger \u0152 German \u0152 from a German prisoner of war camp, on 4 April, 1945, after having been previously reported as missing in action on 4 January, 1945. I\u2122d previously written to Bob \u2122s company clerk, and his answer was written before the report of Bob \u2122s liberation was received, at Sixth Armored Division headquarters. So, along with the letter from ETO headquarters, came a letter from Sixth Armored, dated eight days earlier, stating that there was no further news of Bob . The letter read, in part, PFC Max was with his company as they attacked enemy positions, about one and a half miles northeast of Marvie , Belgium , on je \u0152 on 4 January, 1945. An enormous amount of armored enemy artillery, mortar and small arms fire, was encountered, and squads and individuals became separated at times, because of the necessity of seeking protection from this fire. After this engagement, PFC Max was not present. A search was made of the vicinity, but he could neither be found, nor accounted for, and up to the present date, there had been no further information on your brother. Well, further information came today, and I don\u2122t think I\u2122ve ever received anything that made me happier. Captain Budrogy (ph) informed me that all prisoners of war, for more than 30 days, are returned to the United States . If that is so, there is an excellent chance of your seeing him soon. I wish I could, too. If he is going to be reassigned, I\u2122d like to get him into my outfit. Better still, I\u2122d like to see Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 150 him stay in the States . I intend asking Captain Budrogy \u2122s(ph) advice tomorrow. What can I add to a letter like this? I\u2122m overjoyed, and can\u2122t think of another thing right now. I know how happy you both must be, and I know now that God must have heard your prayers. All I can say is that we have a lot to be thankful for. Call Diana when you receive this letter.
