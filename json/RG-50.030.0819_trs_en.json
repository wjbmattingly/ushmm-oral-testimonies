I knew not much more about an automobile engine than the fact that \u2014 I knew there was a carburetor, I knew there were spark plugs, and I knew somewhere, something created a spark, and that ignited the gasoline, and that created the power.

The company that I had trained with, the 106\" infantry division, in the U.S., on that first day of battle, lost 75 percent of its troops, killed, wounded or captured, or missing. Seventy-five percent in one day. The word was that that division that I trained with \u2014 and I left early, to be shipped over as a replacement, they were not ready yet for combat. They were green. And you read the accounts of \u2014 of \u2014 of that unit, the 106\" infantry division, and you realize how poorly prepared they were. They were scattered, they ran in all directions.

When you tally up your troops afterward, you say, this guy\u2019s missing. They had no idea what happened to me. We had been fighting, the German attacked, and I was with the unit, I was on the line, I was fighting. We were face to face with the enemy, we were fi-fighting. And then I and others were \u2014 were ordered back behind the lines, because this had been going on for days, and I was weary. So yeah, they figured the troops need some rest, go back behind the lines, get some rest, get some food, and then you\u2019ll resume later on. So when I got behind \u2014 behind the lines, I was now with all allied forces, the ger \u2014 Germans were far removed, I heard somebody say, we need volunteers. We\u2019ve lost radio contact. The Germans have apparently knocked out our radio contact with front line troops. So we have to establish where our \u2014 our lines are. We need vala \u2014 volunteers to do that. I was still 21, I think, so I was young, and adventurous. I\u2019d  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Robert Max \u201d July 14, 2015 just begun to learn what war was about. But I also felt that 1t was a mission. Something moved me, and \u2014 and I said, yeah. So Pll vol \u2014 Pll volunteer. I saw a Jeep in the di \u2014 in the distance, and I said, I'll get that Jeep. And I signaled to five others, and they joined me. We said, we \u2014 we \u2014 we'll be a volunteer task force, we'll go as far as we can go, and see if we can identify where our lines are. High command cannot pri \u2014 plan strategy, unless they know where the lines are. So, that\u2019s what we started out to do. So, we\u2019re in this Jeep, it\u2019s now \u2014 the vision is not very clear, it\u2019s an overcast sky. I remember driving the Jeep, the roads are covered with 1\u2014 snow and ice. We round a curve, and just about \u2014 maybe about 10 to 15 yards ahead of me, there\u2019s a German 88 millimeter cannon pointed right at the Jeep, right at us. And it\u2019s mounted on an 80 \u2014 on a\u2014 a\u2014 a German ta-tank. And so, you know, anybody pulled that trigger, we were gone. And I can talk, and I do talk man \u2014many, many times, the number of times that you are exposed to killing, to being killed, and that was \u2014 that was one of them, and there were many, many others. So it\u2019s, you know, miracles take place, and you don\u2019t get killed. But that was one that they certainly \u2014 somebody should have pulled the trigger, and we would have been gone. They didn\u2019t. I jammed on the brakes, we skidded off the road. All of a sudden, fire from rifles \u2014 apparently mi \u2014 rifles and machine-guns, small arm fire, is pouring in from our right. And we \u2014 none of us were hit immediately. I \u2014 I say, we  https://collections.ushmm.org  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Robert Max i July 14, 2015 have to \u2014 we have to defend ourselves yet. Have to find something, we can\u2019t do it from the Jeep here. We see a shack across the road, and I say, we move toward that shack. We did. One of the men had the perception to real-realize, we go near the machine-gun \u2014 some \u2014 somebody\u2019s firing a lot of \u2014 lot of ri-rifle fire at us, or machine-gun fire. So he too \u2014 he detached the one from the Jeep, and brought that with us. So we start racing for the shack. One of our men is hit and killed on the way over. We get to the shack, and the enemy fire is still pouring in. We have to set up the machine-gun, some way, to fire back. And so there\u2019s a big bay window in the shack. The man who took the machine-gun, I think it was him, he sets it up in the window, and he starts firing. Within maybe a minute or so, he\u2019s hit, and he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s killed. When I talk to student groups, I \u2014 I say sometimes people \u2014 un-understand, you do things under battlefield conditions, you do things you would not normally do, because you do it on your instinct. Something tells you that you have to take \u2014 you have to do something right now. So, my instinct, without thinking about the consequences, I was wide open, I would be killed just like the other man was, your instinct 1s a \u2014 1s a\u2014 jump behind that gun. Which is what I did, and I started firing. And I fired the machine gun at everything I saw move. I hit some, probably killed a number of their men. And that went on \u2014 that had started early in the morning \u2014 that went on until late in the afternoon, we\u2019re running out of fire. We didn\u2019t \u2014 we had no  https://collections.ushmm.org  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Robert Max \" July 14, 2015 idea what we were against, at the time. I learned later on that there were at least a hundred \u2014 somewhere between a hundred and 200 si \u2014 over there, dug in, in foxholes. And we were \u2014 we started out with six of us, one was killed immediately, so there were five of us, fighting them, and for a good part of the day. That machine-gun really kept us going. When we ran low on ammunition, we had to devise some strategy, how do we get out of this? We had two wounded. There was another window, so two a \u2014 two of them were hit. I \u2014 I looked, and I saw a trap door in the floor of this shack, meaning there must be a cellar beneath. So the strategy was simply this; we had to make them believe that they killed us off, or that we \u2014 we \u2014 we took off toward our \u2014 our rank, toward our \u2014 our la \u2014 our American and our British lines. And so, I figure, we'll climb down into this cellar, and then when it\u2019s dark, under cover of darkness, we\u2019ll emerge. If we can take those two wounded, we will certainly do that, we certainly wanted to do that. And we \u2014 so that was the \u2014 that was the idea. We would infiltrate through their lines at night, under cover of darkness, we possibly could do that."

I mean, there was no way you could es \u2014 you could escape. Behind me, if I tried to run there, there were guards there. There were other foxholes, so I \u2014 it was just no place to go. And so I\u2014I se \u2014 I realized I had \u2014 the only option I had was conversation. But I\u2019m talking to a German. And so, what he \u2014 and then I remembered, just a moment ago he said, I have to shoot you, this man speaks English. Maybe we can converse, and you know. So he says \u2014 he looks up at me \u2014 we pau \u2014 we paused for a while. I\u2019ve given up the idea of running. He looks up and he says, why are you Americans here? This is not your war. I said, how \u2014 I said, you made it our war, how can you say that? Conversation goes on. The reason that I think this sequence would be so good on film, as opposed to just in print, you know, you have to see a relationship developing between this German soldier, and this American soldier. I\u2019m his captive, he\u2019s supposed to shoot me, and he doesn\u2019t."

He\u2019s a noncommissioned officer, he\u2019s probably allowed to carry a pistol, he\u2019s going to shoot me with a pistol instead of the rifle. Instead, he pulls out a wallet. He opens the wallet, and then he turns it towards me, he shows me pictures of his wife and two children. And he says, next year, we will be in New York City. That was his plan. He foresaw it.

And I try to explain who we are, I don\u2019t think he knew. He starts to close the door. I have one good foot and shoe, I stick the left foot in the door. And then I hear voices from the rear. They sound like elderly people. And he motioned for them to come to the door. They do, and it is this elderly couple. I notice the man takes a look on the jacket, I have a U.S. emblem, and he looks at it, and there\u2019s a\u2014 a smile on his face. I say, what \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014 what\u2019s he smiling about? We\u2019re desperate here, and he\u2019s smiling at us. He comes walking out to the porch, to look up and down, to see if there are any soldiers. He then takes us \u2014 he then motions \u2014 he sees no soldiers \u2014 if they\u2019re captured \u2014 1-1f \u2014 if \u20141if\u20141f the g \u20141f the German soldiers come by, and we were in their house with them, not only would we be shot, they would be shot as traitors. In all likelihood, that\u2019s what would happen. So he has to look out and see if there are any soldiers. None there. Motions for us to come in, and his wife joins us. She sees our condition, and almost without saying anything, she goes, I guess, to the kitchen, and she comes out with three ladles of so \u2014 ladles and some \u2014 some kind of cups of some sort, of hot soup, with a piece of meat in it. Perception on her part, she sees the condition, and she recognizes, more than anything. To us, just seeing a living quarters, it was so startling. I re \u2014 I remember just \u2014 just standing there, even before taking the food, and just looking. There were curtains, drapes, carpeting, furniture, lamps. We  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection  112 Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 hadn\u2019t seen that in a long time, we were living just in the outdoors alone. So that was striking. But then, the food was so delect \u2014 just absolutely delectable. I \u2014 normally when you\u2019re hungry, you \u2014 you gulp it down. But I \u2014 I savored it, just the taste of food, was so great. After they fed us, we talked for a little bit. Amazingly, they spoke reasonable English. Why did they want to save us? Some years earlier, this couple had traveled to America. They spent time in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Their experience with Americans, and America, was so good, when he saw that emblem, that\u2019s what made him smile. And that\u2019s what probably \u2014 probably got them to take the risk of bringing us into their home, and take \u2014 and take \u2014 you know, and feeding us. After that experience, they then knew that they couldn\u2019t keep us there. They got a piece of paper, and they drew a map, showing us alleyways to go through. We could hear shellfire, not \u2014 not small arms fire yet, but we knew we were fairly close to allied lines. And they knew too, that the allies were near. So, if they could get us to a safe place, they thought that in a few days, the way the allies were moving, from reports they had, I guess, heard, or whatever, we would be rescued."

I see a stool, I see a cow, and I see sitting on that stool, 1t must have been a German soldier. Now, he had his top of his uniform off, and I could see that long, white underwear, extending out of his black pants. Underwear, and black suspenders stretched over the underwear, and then the big, black boots he was wearing. And he\u2019s milking a cow. I stirred a little bit, and some hay falls through the crack.

My Jewish life was pretty much set by my mother, so I knew I had to go to synagogue, even though it was done in extreme form, like a Orthodoxy, and all that.

I was a kid when I went in, now I\u2019m reasonably mature, and I start to think. I was very, very lucky, as \u2014 as when I \u2014 when I talk to senior audiences, very often men will come up and surround me, and say, your life was a miracle. You \u2014 you should have been killed many, many times, but you\u2019re still here. So that \u2014 that thought ran through my head, and there was something urging me inside. I\u2014 I don\u2019t know what it \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it was, but I\u2014 I knew I had to respond in some way, to what I had been through.

I knew things about Jewish life, and Jewish philanthropy, that I learned only late \u2014 later on. I didn\u2019t know as a \u2014 a youngster, and maybe I never would have come across it. The fact that I became president of Hillel, a Jewish international organization, did help me a great deal, in understanding that a Jewish life is important, and saving j \u2014 other Jewish lives is important, too. So, when it came time to set up different type of operations, I set up \u2014 I \u2014I-congregational life was \u2014 was important. I sat on a number of different boards. I did fundraising for United Jewish Appeal, because that money went not just to people in need, an-an-and in many ca \u2014 1n some cases, not even to just Jewish causes, cause many of the things that we did as Jews, went for the public at large.

Social service  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 140  Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 agencies like that do provide services to people who are not Jewish. So, that was what I was committed. One of the places I \u2014 I became very much involved in, was the Daughters of Israel Geriatric Center. This was a home for the aged. I had aging parents.

You know, travel, go see your grandkids, take vacations, things of that nature. Those are the golden years. But I saw people in housing, senior housing in New Jersey. They were not Jewish, just Jewish based. These were people who had given up on life. I developed a program that would hand \u2014 may enable them to re-reengage with life, reinstitute things that they had done earlier in their lives. Some had been great cooks, some had worked in the industry, some had been musicians, and all that. But now, you\u2019re over 65, so you stop doing all of that, and in the process, you lose the essence of life. You still have some years ahead. And so I wrote this program out, and my par-partner, he and \u2014 he had access to people who would fund it. We got the funding, developed. That was a non-profit corporation. We didn\u2019t charge for the services. We went throughout New Jersey, to homes for the aged. The experience was not lectures, I didn\u2019t lecture to them, but there were big charts they had on the wall.

Whatever  Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about this collection 142  Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 they did, which they were doing no more. So they plotted that out. And I\u2014I go \u2014 guided them through that. And many of them adopted new careers, absolutely careers. The most \u2014 probably the most dynamic one in all of them was a Holocaust survivor in a home for the elderly in Cranford, New Jersey.

Just a few ye \u2014 hours ago, I received a letter from European theater of operations headquarters, telling me that Bob was okay. Here is the first paragraph of the letter: Dear Corporal Max, I\u2019m very happy to report that your brother, PFC  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection  149 Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 Robert R. Max, ASN 15311529, was liberated by our advancing forces, from a ger \u2014 German \u2014 from a German prisoner of war camp, on 4 April, 1945, after having been previously reported as missing in action on 4 January, 1945. I\u2019d previously written to Bob\u2019s company clerk, and his answer was written before the report of Bob\u2019s liberation was received, at Sixth Armored Division headquarters. So, along with the letter from ETO headquarters, came a letter from Sixth Armored, dated eight days earlier, stating that there was no further news of Bob. The letter read, in part, PFC Max was with his company as they attacked enemy positions, about one and a half miles northeast of Marvie, Belgium, on je \u2014 on 4 January, 1945. An enormous amount of armored enemy artillery, mortar and small arms fire, was encountered, and squads and individuals became separated at times, because of the necessity of seeking protection from this fire. After this engagement, PFC Max was not present. A search was made of the vicinity, but he could neither be found, nor accounted for, and up to the present date, there had been no further information on your brother. Well, further information came today, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever received anything that made me happier. Captain Budrogy(ph) informed me that all prisoners of war, for more than 30 days, are returned to the United States. If that is so, there is an excellent chance of your seeing him soon. I wish I could, too. If he is going to be reassigned, I\u2019d like to get him into my outfit. Better still, I'd like to see  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection  150 Interview with Robert Max July 14, 2015 him stay in the States. I intend asking Captain Budrogy\u2019s(ph) advice tomorrow. What can I add to a letter like this? I\u2019m overjoyed, and can\u2019t think of another thing right now. I know how happy you both must be, and I know now that God must have heard your prayers. All I can say is that we have a lot to be thankful for. Call Diana when you receive this letter. I\u2019m too excited to write any more tonight. When I calm down, I\u2019m going to write Bob at Central Postal Directory, APO 640, U.S. Army, and within few days, I\u2019m going to send you the letters for safekeeping. Right now I want to enjoy them myself. Write soon, and God bless you. Love to Ruthie.\u201d"
