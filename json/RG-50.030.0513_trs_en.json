So when we tried to smuggle the border, my mother tried every evening to -- there were the booths, and there was a Polish soldier on this side, Russian soldier -- you know, they like -- on the border they had a booth, yes, one Polish flag and one side the Russian flag, and soldiers in their uniforms. The Russians stood with the rifles, and the Polish with the rifles. So my mother took us every day, sometime in the evening, sometime in the afternoon, but not at dark, and she spoke Russian and she spoke Polish to the other. I remember the Russian soldier got upset, he took the rifle and say in Russian, \u201cDavai na zad.\u201d Go back. My mother didn\u2019t want to move back, and she started to beg and cry. He pushed her with the carabine -- with the rifle, with the other side, with the wooden side, pushed her in here and my mother fell, and she didn't move. And we thought my -- the mother is dead. Me and my brother started to cry. Momma, Momma, we spoke Polish. Momma stine, Momma styoff in Yiddish. Get up, get up Momma. You not dead, you not dead. And the -- my mother was like fainted or whatever, she didn\u2019t move. So the soldier came over, the Russian, yelling at us, davai na zad, but we didn\u2019t know what davai na zad is. Go back, go back. But s -- I cry, |say Momma, Momma. And they spoke Polish on the border, the Russian spoke Polish. I said to him in Polish, \u201cMy mom is dead? My mom is not living?\u201d So he say, \u201cYour mom 1s going to be fine.\u201d He went down, I don\u2019t know what he said to her. She later told me. When she came to herself, sh -- he picked her up, he -- her- she was all in mud, it was muddy, rainy, and we went back to our place. And she tried again. With the Polish soldier nothing, they -- they were very rude, they couldn\u2019t do it. One day -- she kept separ -- now I understand she kept secrets from me or brother -- my brother was little. She couldn\u2019t tell me. And she said one day to me, \u201cSurele, gather everything what we have the little bundles, put everything together and we go for a walk in the evening.\u201d It was a nice evening, it was not raining and it wasn\u2019t cold, it was dry. And we walked. I was holding my mom by the skirt because she was holding my brother, he couldn\u2019t walk too much. And Mordechai, my brother, the chubby guy, always was hungry, always. He liked food and was hungry. He was crying because he was hungry. And whenever I had a piece of bread she gave us the same ration, I cut a piece for him later. I knew he will cry, so I gave him my share. One evening we went to the woods, didn\u2019t tell us anything. She say we going here, maybe we\u2019ll find something to eat, some grass growing or mushrooms, you know, wild mushrooms, wild grass, and we\u2019 ll find. And it was dark, it was twilight, you know, it wasn\u2019t light any more. But we could still see, and we were walking along the line and there was a wire, you know, there were -- it was wired, the whole thing. And all of a sudden my mom says, \u201cSit here, let\u2019s sit here.\u201d We sat on the grass, my mother went to the wire to the gate, and underneath she pushed it up, there was like a hole. Later I find out that the soldier, when he beat her and she was laying like that, he told her, at night you go here, and there is a open wire. And you go to the woods. And he told her what to expect. She didn\u2019t say anything to us, nothing, we were too little, and we could tell. So what happened? She digged a little bit, she pushed my brother underneath, fine, she pushed me, and then she made a little higher, I was holding up the wire a little bit, lifted it as much as I could for five years old."

And I put my mother\u2019s shoes, of course, her size was, I think, 39 then, and I was little. I put my mother\u2019s shoes, and I\u2019m running. I put something on myself, I don\u2019t remember what I put, something, and I running and crying, running and crying. And that -- my mother should not die, my mother should not die, my mother is sick. I go fast to -- to get babushka, she will help her. So, the babushka lived in a small hut also, nobody had a hou -- tall houses, nobody. It was a barrack, one room and that\u2019s it. No luxuries. So I knocked in the window, in the babushka\u2019s window. M -- she was prepared. She told my mother, if something happened to you, send Szuritska -- send Szura to call me, and I will come. So, I knocked in the window a few times, nobody answer, and I start screaming, \u201cBabushka, Babushka, come, my mom is dying.\u201d In Russian [speaks Russian]. I -- I thought my mom is dying. So she say, Szurka, like this, she was an old woman -- I don\u2019t know, maybe she was not old then. She was wearing that scarf on the head. A short woman, blue eyes, I remember her. We call her babushka, we didn\u2019t know the name. And the babushka came out, she said to me, \u201cRelax, what happened?\u201d I say, \u201cMama is dying, Mama is in pain, Mama is dying. She send me to you to come.\u201d Okay. So we\u2019re running, running, and there is water, dark, and my mother\u2019s shoes were stuck in the mud, and I left it there. I didn\u2019t have time to go back to ge-get it, so I took the other shoe off, I\u2019m barefoot, I run, and I remember where that shoe is, you know? So, my mom\u2019s shoes, and she came to the room, she saw my mother, she took me and my brother out, pushed us out of the door. And she said, \u201cStay here, don\u2019t come in.\u201d We don\u2019t know what happened to Mom, we crying. My brother even more than me, he was crying. He say, \u201cWhat happened to mom, she is going to die.\u201d I said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Mordechai. Stay put quiet, be quiet. We won\u2019t -- we don\u2019t know, maybe she will not die.

I didn\u2019t know what Jesus is, what religion, nothing then. In Russia there was no religion, nobody talked about anything. I came home crying, dirty Jew, dirty Jew [Polish] like in Polish the parshiva like somebody has a disease, you know, uncurable disease. I never seen such hatreds during the war with the Russian like I encountered in Poland. They were so against everything and everybody, especially Jews. Jews killed Jesus, Jews are bad, we have to kill the Jews. I said to my mom, I\u2019m not going to that school. My mom said, where would you go? It\u2019s far away, this is close. I said, I\u2019m not going to that school, they call me names and I don\u2019t know even why. One day she went there and there was a priest, a young priest and she spoke to that priest.

I started to analyze, I said, \u201cWhy am I a dirty Jew? You also Jewish.\u201d I asked the priest -- I started to -- to be more political.

I don\u2019t know anything about religion because in my house they told us we are Jewish and that was it. We didn\u2019t go to synagogue, my parents didn\u2019t go nowhere. There was later, a Jewish synagogue, beautiful, built 800 years ago by German Jews in that city, and Hitler used to come to Wroclaw and had speeches in a big hall, which 1s still there. It\u2019s a beautiful city. I started bec -- I became very conscious of ma -- about my past, and who am I. I ask question, Mama -- in Polish then -- who are we? We Jewish, you say. Why don\u2019t we go to pray? Why the Polacks have churches, and they call us dirty Jew, why? Always why. M-My mom said, \u201cI cannot answer you all this.
