            "answer": "They did not realize that he was a Jew and like I said earlier, the German Jew was first German. I want to tell you a little incident. There was a Nazi holiday and of course the Jews would not display their flag. My sister and I would make a flag out of a sheet and hang out which my parents naturally reeled back in again. Just to give you a sample like there was no difference."

I remember as a little boy I worked in a little store they were selling health food and I took the deliveries for him. Beau tiful people. But I also remember taking the packages to the post office, other kids would tear the labels off, you know, being Jewish, and causing problems and things."

I\u2122l l tell you how bad it was. One child remarked in school he overheard his parent s the night before saying that some law that Hitler made was ridiculous or, I can\u2122t get the detail; anyway this man, this Christian man, gentile man, was arrested by the German Gestapo and eight weeks la ter his wife received an urn of ashes, they killed him. So the kids were s cared of their parents. You were not allowed to listen to foreign broadcasts, like England and America were separate, so neighbors would turn other neighbors in that they were listening to foreign broadcasts and they were severely punished. You inquired of what type of neighborhood it was. Well, it was not a bad neighborhood. The living quarters were difficult to find and we didn\u2122t live as nice as we did before. We didn\u2122t starve. It was just a differen t type of living. We were under pressure all the time like we were an enemy of your own country. A nd like I said earlier, a lot of people started to deport, they had enough sense to get out of there."

So that sometimes created a problem. You had to have someone. They also had Jewish organizatio ns, I think it was HIAS and others that assisted Jews from leaving. And then of course, you had to have a certain amount of money to leave and since my own ba nk account, my father\u2122s bank account was taken over, at that time, it was almost impossible to leave so when we wanted to leave in the late \u201a\u212230\u2122s, we couldn\u2122t leave anymore. My father want ed to go to Australia, that\u2122s what he hoped to do but it didn\u2122t work out."

He didn\u2122t do it this time because he was a decent guy. The conten ts of the letter would give us an order to vacate our apartment within so many hours and we were allowed so many pounds per person to take with us and then we were told in that sa me letter that we had to take our own key to our apartment to take to the local police station. I al so want to add this that the gold and furs and other things, we had to turn in earlier already, anything of value."

It had running water. The faucets didn\u2122t work, the toilets didn\u2122t work but you could tell it was a regular high school like we almost have in this country.
