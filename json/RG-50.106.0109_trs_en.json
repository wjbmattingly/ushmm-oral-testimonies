Was a very fine school, and a very fine education."

You see, I had a notebook. For each piano lesson she would write in the date, what was my next assignment and at the bottom was a mark from each lesson. If I had a A or a B, it was all right. If I had a C, I was licked. And yet, she was my best friend. When I grew up, she was my best friend. When I got married, it was already 1940. Times were starting to be very bad, I discovere d that I\u2122m pregnant, and I went to my Interview with Lena Jurand August 15, 1998 16mother and I said, Mother, I am pregnant. She didn\u2122t \u0152 sh e didn\u2122t bat an eyelid. She said, then we have to get an abortion. She went with me. She got the doctor. In Poland, to get an abortion is like to spit. As long you have enough money, no problem. She got the women doctor and an other doctor who was present. She took me there. I got an abortion. She says, you cannot have a baby now. And if I had that baby, I wouldn\u2122t have survived, that\u2122s for sure. And after that she said to me, you can rest for 10 minutes, then we walk back home. And we walk ed home, and on the way there she must have seen that I was tired. She said \u0152 we passed an ice cream parlor and she says, would you like some ice cream? So we sat down. She was a very smart woman. She treated me to the ice cream, then she took me home. Walking, mind you. And then, when we cam e home, she said, Father must not know about it. You go now, undress and go to bed and lie down . But at dinnertime I want you dressed, sitting at the table, eating dinner with your father. And this is exactly what I did. He never knew that. He was much more sentimenta l that she was. She was a very great realist. She knew what is going on. Very smart woman."

And they would take us every mo rning out of the ghetto, to that place where we spend the whole day, and in the evening they would \u0152 in the af \u0152 late afternoon they would bring us back.

The director of that camp, he was not a Nazi, he was a newspaperman from Berlin. He was lovely.

When the SS would drop in sometimes, if they didn\u2122t have any theater or any recreation they thought that they will go, and all the women, young or old, had to undress as God has made them. Totally naked. Stand in the row \u0152 I have seen it, and if \u0152 they would look them over, and if they didn\u2122t like a pair of breasts, they would hit with the whip. Anyway they didn\u2122t like the back, they would hit in the back. He would come running to the kitchen and say to me, you don\u2122t go there. I will hide you and you can take a shower whenever you feel like it. And somebody co uld have thought that maybe there was a Interview with Lena Jurand August 15, 1998 38special interest in him in me, and it wasn\u2122t. He was \u0152 he was as much dedicated to my husband as he was to me. He said to me one day, my parents have a farm near Berlin, and I\u2122m making some papers for you so you could go there and spend the rest of the war there working on that farm. Then somebo dy gave him out, that he\u2122s too good to the Jews. And one day they se nt him out to the front, to the Russian front. And the first thing I did when I got ou t of hiding, I tried to find out what has happened to him. And I found a boy who was with him, and he to ld me that he was killed at the Russian front.

My husband couldn\u2122t make himself take them, so I took them. I took them to the train. Of course, rumors were \u0152 we knew where they are going. They had to [indecipherable]"

So I took it off and put it on her. And she \u0152 she \u0152 she embraced me and she said, you tell \u0152 tell my son that I said you will survive the war. I loved my mother-in-law. She was the sweetest woman. The nicest person. I never heard a word of criticism from her to any of her daughters-in-law. She was lovely. So, that was it.

            "answer": "Yes. Must have been maybe later. While we were \u0152 funny how it happens in life. While we were working in that Enklausungstella(ph), Polish woman \u0152 women used to come there to buy some bargains from the Jewish women. We were not allowed to carry anything in our hands. So what we did is, I know I had all my \u0152 my Interview with Lena Jurand August 15, 1998 40beautiful pure silk nightgowns, hand embroide red, which I didn\u2122t need. I used to put one on top of another on myse lf, and this way I could carry it with me. And that Polish woman, whose husband worked in that camp, because some Polish \u0152 Polish people worked in the camp when they were mechanics or they did something with the machines. Her husband worked there, she would come there. And one day we were conducting a transaction, I was selling her my nightgowns, she was buying that. And mind you, she was a total stra nger to me. And I was young. And she would say \u0152 she said sudden ly to me, my God, you are so young, and you are so pretty \u0152 I was pretty at the time \u0152 and I feel so sorry for you. If you want to hide, come to me. I was flabbergasted. I says, do you realize what you are saying? Do you know that if you are caught, they put you to death? Sh e said, I don\u2122t care, I\u2122m not afraid. She was the happy-go-lucky type. That was our luck. Well, from that day on, Julian tried to find out where they lived. And they lived on the other side of the city, quite a distance from us. Her husband would co me every evening to the ghetto \u0152 is it working? \u0152 to the ghetto wall, and Julian would make a package of our things, and through the Jewish policeman give it to hi m, and he would take that home. So, we thought, in case we would have to go and hide, we will have some things there. And that was going on for some while, until November \u212242, when the \u0152 when the rumors started to circulate that there will be a new aktion and they will take people. That Interview with Lena Jurand August 15, 1998 41day Julian said, this time we are not going to give anything, we are going out. My father wasn\u2122t home, because if my father had been home, he wo uld never let me go. So my mother said to me, you go better be fore your father come home \u0152 comes home. We left, it was getting darker, and you know, we had a curfew hour. So we had to be \u0152 go out before the curfew. And as we were going down the stairs to go out \u0152 there was no light in the stairway at the time, it was dark \u0152 I heard my father\u2122s footsteps, he was coming up. And this stands with me, all those years, I still dream of that. And th \u0152 my first impulse was to go to him, but Julian was behind me and he stopped me. And I let my father pass me , and I didn't say goodbye to him. That was the \u0152 the worst thing, I think, in my life. But before we go to that, I \u0152 I have to step back, before I tell you a \u0152 [break]"

            "answer": "Well, there was one requirement of the SS. One day they came to the Judenrat , and they required in a very specific way, they wanted the Judenrat members to do their dirty work. They needed 1,000 b oys, age 12 to 16 being taken from homes. And that was the only time I saw my father crying. I opened the door, he was standing there crying, and I said, what happened? And he was telling me, and I said Interview with Lena Jurand August 15, 1998 42to him, if they want 1,000 boys, you have to give them \u0152 them 1,000 boys. And he said to me, how can you say that, you are my daughter, how can \u0152 how can I go to one mother saying, you son will go, and the other mother, your son will stay? Am I God? I said, you have to do it, because if you don\u2122t do it, you know what will happen. The Nazis will take this \u0152 this 1,000 boys, but they will shoot another 1,000 on the way. And he said, you are right. An d they let them have 1,000 boys during that particular night. Nobody slept, of cour se. Of course the boys were never seen again. And I went out in the morning, ab out six o\u2122clock in the morning, outside. There was not a living soul, nothing. Total stillness. There was not a bird, not a wind, not a breeze, nothing. I went into a rage, and I looked up and I said God damn you, wherever you are. This is not the God I want. I don\u2122t want any part of you. And what\u2122s more, I don\u2122t want you to save me. That was one thing. As you see, it didn\u2122t happen. The other thing was, one day they let me know that the SS came to the Judenrat and took all the members of the Judenrat to the train. And I went wild. So I ran to the Judenrat. We didn't live far away, and I had some friends there, and they said to me, don\u2122t go in. He is a wild animal. He just shot some people, he will shoot you. And I couldn\u2122t care less. I went in. I didn\u2122t knock at the door, I just opened the door, and I can still see him as is it was yesterday. He was the most beautiful young man I have ev er seen. Very tall, very blonde, very Nordic looking, Interview with Lena Jurand August 15, 1998 43with blue eyes like two blue ice cubes. And he was leaning on the desk holding in one hand, in the right hand, he had a \u0152 a gun that was obviously shot a short time ago, in the other a whip. I opened the doo r, he didn\u2122t even look at me. And I didn\u2122t \u0152 didn\u2122t say anything, I was just standing ther e. He said to me, what do you want? In German. So I answered in Ge rman. I said, I came to inquire about my father. And I tell him he is a member of the Judenrat and I hear that he was taken. He still didn\u2122t look at me. He wasn't intere sted at all in what I was saying. What puzzled him was that I used such a good German language. That impressed him. He said to me, where did you learn German so well? I said, well German was my best foreign language, I had it eight years in high school. And I \u0152 I really risk a lot, because I was getting fresh, and I said, would you like me to recite you some Goethe? Then he looked at me and he said, what about you r father? I said, well, I hear he is on the train going to Auschwitz. He called two germ \u0152 two Jewish po licemen and he said, where is that man? So they told him he is on the train and they are going to Auschwitz. He said to me, you go home and wait. I promise you I will get your father. I didn\u2122t have any other \u0152 I had to go. I came home, and all my neighbors were there and my mother. And when I told them, they said, don\u2122t believe it. Nobody has ever come out of the train going to Auschwitz . And we waited and waited and was getting dark outside. About 10 o\u2122clock at night we heard some footsteps. Two Jewish policemen brought Interview with Lena Jurand August 15, 1998 44my father home. Later I was told that they stopped the train on the way and they started calling his name Salzburg . My father was so fatumult that he didn\u2122t even react to that. But somebody sitting next to him said to him, isn\u2122t that your name? He said yes. So he got up and went out of the train and those two Jewish policemen brought him home. He was unconscious fo r about two days. He didn't know what was going on. After he got bette r and he realized that he is home, he took my hand, and he said thank you. So I gave him a \u0152 I gave him a-about a year of miserable life, but life. I still to this day don\u2122t understand what made this German keep his word. It was puzzling to me. But he did. They stopp ed the train, actually. Nobody believed it. Those are the two things I wanted to te ll you about our ghetto experience. Now, going back to coming out of the ghetto \u0152"

People have, when I talk to my granddaughter\u2122s class about it, one boy got up and said, how did Interview with Lena Jurand August 15, 1998 52you do without a toilet? I said, that\u2122s a good question. There was a fire in th \u0152 in the stove, constantly, and that fire helped. Whatever you had to burn, you burned. And the rest you pour out down the drain. So he was satisfied when I explained to him. I said, believe me, it wasn\u2122t easy. Julian developed such a magnificent sense of hearing that he knew what was going on in the kitchen before I knew it. From certain \u0152 he knew which \u0152 which place the floor was squeaking. One time an electrical man came to check the electricity. We didn't know he is coming. And of course he had to come to the room. So that was a \u0152 there was a mirror with a \u0152 a piece of furniture with a mirror standing in the corner, but cutting off that corner, so one could hide behind it. Well Julian s \u0152 only heard the words, electricity, and he pointed to me to go behind that thing and he went under the bed. And the room had to look always unoccupied, always. He came in with her, and I heard her say [sighs]. And he looked at the ri \u0152 lamps or someth ing, checked. And when he left, she came in and she says, good work guys. The firs t 10 months, because we accumulate a lot of things, of clothing in her house, she would sell it for us, and we would give her the money for the food. Well, after 10 mont hs, my things have run out, and I told her, we don\u2122t have any money any more. So she was \u0152 she was very good about it. When he didn\u2122t see, she would open the doo r and quickly push in a \u0152 a \u0152 a \u0152 some soup, let\u2122s say, or some bread. We ate very little, but whatever it was. There was a Interview with Lena Jurand August 15, 1998 53window in that room that was overlooking a field, and a young girl would come every day with her cow to let the cow roam around. And I wouldn\u2122t stand at the window because I was afraid somebody might spot me. So I would kneel at the window and look at her. And I would say to Julian, what I wouldn\u2122t give to be this cow. I mean, people don\u2122t know what it means. 22 months. She worked for a German place. She spoke German. She didn\u2122t know how to read it, but she spoke German, for some reason she did. And on ce in awhile she would invite those German soldiers over for a party. So I he lp her cook and bake. And then we would hide in that pantry. And she would give them enough to \u0152 drinks to make them half drunk, and they would lie down on her bed and sleep. And when they were asleep, we would come in, go right near. I looked at them when they were asleep, and go to other room. When finally the war was almost over, there was a terrible fighting between the German and the Russian armies . Terrible fighting. The entire household went down to the basement, except us. So we were sitting in the pantry, and Julian kept his hands over my ears so I wouldn\u2122t hear that shooting. When suddenly the shooting stopped, and I said to Julian, am I crazy, or did I hear a Russian words there? At the moment when I said that, she opened the door and she said, you are free. The Russians are here, you can go out. There was no joy in me. Absolutely nothing. So I said \u0152 my reaction was, now I am going to sleep. And I went to sleep Interview with Lena Jurand August 15, 1998 54without fear, once. At least once without fear, and I slept 24 hours. Julian went out right away. I couldn\u2122t make myself go out for about a week. I was afraid to face the world. So finally we went out, one Sunda y afternoon. Beautiful, sunny afternoon. My town, where I was born, where I went to school, I didn\u2122t know a living soul. And as we were walking, I said to Julian, where are we going? He says, I don\u2122t know, let\u2122s just walk. And as we were walking a man approach ed us. And he saw me, and he stood there and said, I don\u2122t believe it. Aren\u2122t you Isadore Salzburg\u2122s daughter? I said yes. Was a lawyer, Jewish lawyer. Said to us, where are you going? I said, I don\u2122t know, we don\u2122t have a place. He says, come with me, I just opened an apartment, it belonged to a Nazi. So we went with hi m. There were no beds, but it didn\u2122t matter. I slept on the desk, Julian slept on the floor. And this was our first apartment. And from that day on, I was goi ng out every day, looking for Jews that came out from hiding. And our apartment wa s full of people in a very short time. You were \u0152 you wouldn\u2122t believe, we wo uld spend entire evenings telling s \u0152 each other stories. Of course, I didn\u2122t have a penny to mours \u0152 to our soul. So I \u0152 one day I saw a woman coming out of hiding, and I could recognize them coming out of hiding a mile away, there was something about the \u0152 the way they were walking, like we did. And I \u0152 I saw that woman comi ng out of hiding, and she was a wife of a lawyer, her husband died. And she came out of hiding, so I said, come with me. We Interview with Lena Jurand August 15, 1998 55had a \u0152 a-an apartment full of people. And she \u0152 the first thing she said to me, she took out some money, pocket money \u0152 pa per money from her pocket and said, do you need any money? It was so unimportant . Here, have some. And that was the first money we got. Then Julian joined the army, Polish army as a \u0152 as a physician."

I picked them up, and you know the European pants are finished with the belt of the same material. And as I picked them up, there was something stiff there.

And at that time I gave him such hell for telling me that he doesn\u2122t have it. I said, you promise, you don\u2122t keep you r promise. I was angry at Interview with Lena Jurand August 15, 1998 63him. He said, if I would have shown it to you, you would have taken it then. This way, you waited. And he took it out from hi s pants. That\u2122s a story, huh? He was a very good man. When they t \u0152 when he di ed they gave him a beautiful memorial at Saint Elizabeth\u2122s Hospital. He was clinical director there.

And I \u0152 I thought they were a little bit too young to marry, but he insisted \u0152 they were both 20 \u0152 he insisted they get married. They got married, they had a little apartment near GW where he was going to medical school. And I thought everything was beautiful until about maybe six or seven months after they got married, he ask us to come over and we did. And she was sitting next to the window, and I says, what is it sweetheart? Interview with Lena Jurand August 15, 1998 95Maybe we come here maybe too often, I thought, maybe it\u2122s too much for her. She says no, you know, I love you, but I just don\u2122t want to be married any more. And it was a terrific blow to him, really bad. She was the one who got the divorce and as far as I know, to this day she didn\u2122t remarry. So then he met this girl, and she\u2122s not Jewish. And he married her, and seem like a good marriage. She works for the World Bank. She\u2122s a good mother. I would have preferred marry a Jewish girl, but who am I to say something? And he seems to be working out very nicely. He took over the psychiatric division of the hospital in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and he directed now a play in the theater, he goes in his father\u2122s footsteps. And he wants me to move there. So I don\u2122t know what life will bring, whatever it is. And I think it\u2122s very nice of you to sit here and listen to me for such a long time. You must be exhausted."
