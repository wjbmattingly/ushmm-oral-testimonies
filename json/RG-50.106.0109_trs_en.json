You see, I had a notebook. For each piano lesson she would write in the date, what was my next assignment and at the bottom was a mark from each lesson. If I had a A ora B, it was all right. If I had a C, I was licked. And yet, she was my best friend. When I grew up, she was my best friend. When I got married, it was already 1940. Times were starting to be very bad, I discovered that I\u2019m pregnant, and I went to my Interview with Lena Jurand ie August 15, 1998 mother and I said, Mother, I am pregnant. She didn\u2019t \u2014 she didn\u2019t bat an eyelid. She said, then we have to get an abortion. She went with me. She got the doctor. In Poland, to get an abortion 1s like to spit. As long you have enough money, no problem. She got the women doctor and another doctor who was present. She took me there. I got an abortion. She says, you cannot have a baby now. And if I had that baby, I wouldn\u2019t have survived, that\u2019s for sure. And after that she said to me, you can rest for 10 minutes, then we walk back home. And we walked home, and on the way there she must have seen that I was tired. She said \u2014 we passed an ice cream parlor and she says, would you like some ice cream? So we sat down. She was a very smart woman. She treated me to the ice cream, then she took me home. Walking, mind you. And then, when we came home, she said, Father must not know about it. You go now, undress and go to bed and lie down. But at dinnertime I want you dressed, sitting at the table, eating dinner with your father. And this 1s exactly what I did. He never knew that. He was much more sentimental that she was. She was a very great realist. She knew what is going on. Very smart woman."

And they would take us every morning out of the ghetto, to that place where we spend the whole day, and in the evening they would \u2014 in the af \u2014 late afternoon they would bring us back. The reason why this 1s important 1s because there was one German \u2014 | cannot talk about it \u2014 about him without crying \u2014 whom I was so grateful to. The director of that camp, he was not a Nazi, he was a newspaperman from Berlin. He was lovely. He said to me \u2014 he was always address me the German way, Frau Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Lena Jurand \u201d August 15, 1998 Doktor, because in German language, the woman gets the title of her husband, if he is a doctor. So he would come to me and he would say, I am so ashamed, I am so embarrassed, but I know I am being watched. And according to their rules, if somebody was caught stealing something, what could you steal something there? A dirty pair of socks or a dirty pair of pants. He has to give them public beating. So one day he came to me and he said \u2014 there was a 15 year old boy there working, and he was caught stealing the pair of socks, and he says, I am supposed to give him a public licking. Tell him to scream as loud as he can. I will not hurt him, but I have to pretend that I am doing it, I have been watched. I know I am being watched. So I did that. He didn\u2019t let me work with the \u2014 with the uniforms. He says, you are not going to work there. You stay in the kitchen and peel potatoes. And to this day I cannot peel potatoes without turning my head away. When the SS would drop in sometimes, if they didn\u2019t have any theater or any recreation they thought that they will go, and all the women, young or old, had to undress as God has made them. Totally naked. Stand in the row \u2014 I have seen it, and if \u2014 they would look them over, and if they didn\u2019t like a pair of breasts, they would hit with the whip. Anyway they didn\u2019t like the back, they would hit in the back. He would come running to the kitchen and say to me, you don\u2019t go there. I will hide you and you can take a shower whenever you feel like it. And somebody could have thought that maybe there was a Interview with Lena Jurand \u201d August 15, 1998 special interest in him in me, and it wasn\u2019t. He was \u2014 he was as much dedicated to my husband as he was to me. He said to me one day, my parents have a farm near Berlin, and I\u2019m making some papers for you so you could go there and spend the rest of the war there working on that farm. Then somebody gave him out, that he\u2019s too good to the Jews. And one day they sent him out to the front, to the Russian front. And the first thing I did when I got out of hiding, I tried to find out what has happened to him. And I found a boy who was with him, and he told me that he was killed at the Russian front. I still remember his last name, Burba, b-u-r-b-a. He was a newspaperman. He was so nice."

While we were working in that Enklausungstella(ph), Polish woman \u2014 women used to come there to buy some bargains from the Jewish women. We were not allowed to carry anything in our hands. So what we did is, I know I had all my \u2014 my Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Lena Jurand \u201d August 15, 1998 beautiful pure silk nightgowns, hand embroidered, which I didn\u2019t need. I used to put one on top of another on myself, and this way I could carry it with me. And that Polish woman, whose husband worked in that camp, because some Polish \u2014 Polish people worked in the camp when they were mechanics or they did something with the machines. Her husband worked there, she would come there. And one day we were conducting a transaction, I was selling her my nightgowns, she was buying that. And mind you, she was a total stranger to me.

If you want to hide, come to me. I was flabbergasted. I says, do you realize what you are saying? Do you know that if you are caught, they put you to death? She said, I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m not afraid. She was the happy-go-lucky type. That was our luck. Well, from that day on, Julian tried to find out where they lived. And they lived on the other side of the city, quite a distance from us. Her husband would come every evening to the ghetto \u2014 is it working? \u2014 to the ghetto wall, and Julian would make a package of our things, and through the Jewish policeman give it to him, and he would take that home. So, we thought, in case we would have to go and hide, we will have some things there. And that was going on for some while, until November \u201942, when the \u2014 when the rumors started to circulate that there will be a new aktion and they will take people. That Interview with Lena Jurand \" August 15, 1998 day Julian said, this time we are not going to give anything, we are going out. My father wasn\u2019t home, because if my father had been home, he would never let me go. So my mother said to me, you go better before your father come home \u2014 comes home. We left, it was getting darker, and you know, we had a curfew hour. So we had to be \u2014 go out before the curfew. And as we were going down the stairs to go out \u2014 there was no light in the stairway at the time, 1t was dark \u2014 I heard my father\u2019s footsteps, he was coming up. And this stands with me, all those years, I still dream of that. And th \u2014 my first impulse was to go to him, but Julian was behind me and he stopped me. And I let my father pass me, and I didn't say goodbye to him. That was the \u2014 the worst thing, I think, in my life.

They needed 1,000 boys, age 12 to 16 being taken from homes. And that was the only time I saw my father crying. I opened the door, he was standing there crying, and I said, what happened? And he was telling me, and I said Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Lena Jurand * August 15, 1998 to him, if they want 1,000 boys, you have to give them \u2014 them 1,000 boys. And he said to me, how can you say that, you are my daughter, how can \u2014 how can I go to one mother saying, you son will go, and the other mother, your son will stay? Am I God? I said, you have to do it, because if you don\u2019t do it, you know what will happen. The Nazis will take this \u2014 this 1,000 boys, but they will shoot another 1,000 on the way. And he said, you are right. And they let them have 1,000 boys during that particular night. Nobody slept, of course. Of course the boys were never seen again. And I went out in the morning, about six o\u2019clock in the morning, outside. There was not a living soul, nothing. Total stillness. There was not a bird, not a wind, not a breeze, nothing. I went into a rage, and I looked up and I said God damn you, wherever you are. This is not the God I want. I don\u2019t want any part of you. And what\u2019s more, I don\u2019t want you to save me. That was one thing. As you see, it didn\u2019t happen. The other thing was, one day they let me know that the SS came to the Judenrat and took all the members of the Judenrat to the train. And I went wild. So I ran to the Judenrat. We didn't live far away, and I had some friends there, and they said to me, don\u2019t go in. He is a wild animal. He just shot some people, he will shoot you. And I couldn\u2019t care less. I went in. I didn\u2019t knock at the door, I just opened the door, and I can still see him as is it was yesterday. He was the most beautiful young man I have ever seen. Very tall, very blonde, very Nordic looking, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Lena Jurand \u201c August 15, 1998 with blue eyes like two blue ice cubes. And he was leaning on the desk holding in one hand, in the right hand, he had a \u2014 a gun that was obviously shot a short time ago, in the other a whip. I opened the door, he didn\u2019t even look at me. And I didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t say anything, I was just standing there. He said to me, what do you want? In German. So I answered in German. I said, I came to inquire about my father. And I tell him he is a member of the Judenrat and I hear that he was taken. He still didn\u2019t look at me. He wasn't interested at all in what I was saying. What puzzled him was that I used such a good German language. That impressed him. He said to me, where did you learn German so well? I said, well German was my best foreign language, I had it eight years in high school. And I \u2014 I really risk a lot, because I was getting fresh, and I said, would you like me to recite you some Goethe? Then he looked at me and he said, what about your father? I said, well, I hear he is on the train going to Auschwitz. He called two germ \u2014 two Jewish policemen and he said, where is that man? So they told him he is on the train and they are going to Auschwitz. He said to me, you go home and wait. I promise you I will get your father. I didn\u2019t have any other \u2014 I had to go. I came home, and all my neighbors were there and my mother. And when I told them, they said, don\u2019t believe it. Nobody has ever come out of the train going to Auschwitz. And we waited and waited and was getting dark outside. About 10 o\u2019clock at night we heard some footsteps. Two Jewish policemen brought Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Lena Jurand \u201c August 15, 1998 my father home. Later I was told that they stopped the train on the way and they started calling his name Salzburg. My father was so fatumult that he didn\u2019t even react to that. But somebody sitting next to him said to him, isn\u2019t that your name? He said yes. So he got up and went out of the train and those two Jewish policemen brought him home. He was unconscious for about two days. He didn't know what was going on. After he got better and he realized that he is home, he took my hand, and he said thank you. So I gave him a \u2014I gave him a-about a year of miserable life, but life. I still to this day don\u2019t understand what made this German keep his word. It was puzzling to me. But he did. They stopped the train, actually. Nobody believed it. Those are the two things I wanted to tell you about our ghetto experience. Now, going back to coming out of the ghetto \u2014"

So Julian said \u2014 first he thought he 1s going to ask for his papers, so he says, I have [speaks foreign language here] which means, I have a \u2014 I am allowed to walk after curfew. He had that document. Interview with Lena Jurand August 15, 1998 He says [speaks foreign language], it\u2019s not important. Julian had a \u2014 what do you call it? Not lantern."

And he thought he \u2014 he is going to ask him for papers, and things like that. That was one thing. Then we came there. Now, we came to hide, we were hidden for 22 months, from November to August \u00b044. It was a kitchen, you entered, there was a little hall, and a pantry without the window. That pantry was very important. And then you entered the kitchen and there was one room behind the kitchen. There was no separate entrance to the room, it had to be through the kitchen. They lived all their lives, especially in the winter, in the kitchen, because there was the stove and it was warm. She entertained German soldiers in that kitchen. We were in the room. We could not \u2014 can you imagine in 22 months you cannot sneeze, you cannot cough, you cannot say a lot of word, and you cannot make a \u2014 a loud step, and you cannot be sick. We lived like that in that room for 22 months. There was no toilet in that apartment. In other words, if we wanted to use the facilities, you had to go a half a flight stairs down, and there was, probably for \u2014 for many people, there was the facility. People have, when I talk to my granddaughter\u2019s class about it, one boy got up and said, how did Interview with Lena Jurand ~ August 15, 1998 you do without a toilet? I said, that\u2019s a good question. There was a fire in th \u2014 in the stove, constantly, and that fire helped. Whatever you had to burn, you burned. And the rest you pour out down the drain. So he was satisfied when I explained to him. I said, believe me, it wasn\u2019t easy. Julian developed such a magnificent sense of hearing that he knew what was going on in the kitchen before I knew it. From certain \u2014 he knew which \u2014 which place the floor was squeaking. One time an electrical man came to check the electricity. We didn't know he 1s coming. And of course he had to come to the room. So that was a \u2014 there was a mirror with a\u2014a piece of furniture with a mirror standing in the corner, but cutting off that corner, so one could hide behind it. Well Julian s \u2014 only heard the words, electricity, and he pointed to me to go behind that thing and he went under the bed. And the room had to look always unoccupied, always. He came in with her, and I heard her say [sighs]. And he looked at the ri \u2014 lamps or something, checked. And when he left, she came in and she says, good work guys. The first 10 months, because we accumulate a lot of things, of clothing in her house, she would sell 1t for us, and we would give her the money for the food. Well, after 10 months, my things have run out, and I told her, we don\u2019t have any money any more. So she was \u2014 she was very good about tt. When he didn\u2019t see, she would open the door and quickly push in a \u2014 a\u2014 a\u2014 some soup, let\u2019s say, or some bread. We ate very little, but whatever it was. There was a Interview with Lena Jurand * August 15, 1998 window in that room that was overlooking a field, and a young girl would come every day with her cow to let the cow roam around. And I wouldn\u2019t stand at the window because I was afraid somebody might spot me. So I would kneel at the window and look at her. And I would say to Julian, what I wouldn\u2019t give to be this cow. I mean, people don\u2019t know what it means. 22 months. She worked for a German place. She spoke German. She didn\u2019t know how to read it, but she spoke German, for some reason she did. And once in awhile she would invite those German soldiers over for a party. So I help her cook and bake. And then we would hide in that pantry. And she would give them enough to \u2014 drinks to make them half drunk, and they would lie down on her bed and sleep. And when they were asleep, we would come in, go right near. I looked at them when they were asleep, and go to other room. When finally the war was almost over, there was a terrible fighting between the German and the Russian armies. Terrible fighting. The entire household went down to the basement, except us. So we were sitting in the pantry, and Julian kept his hands over my ears so I wouldn\u2019t hear that shooting. When suddenly the shooting stopped, and I said to Julian, am I crazy, or did I hear a Russian words there? At the moment when I said that, she opened the door and she said, you are free. The Russians are here, you can go out. There was no joy in me. Absolutely nothing. So I said \u2014 my reaction was, now I am going to sleep. And I went to sleep Interview with Lena Jurand ~ August 15, 1998 without fear, once. At least once without fear, and I slept 24 hours. Julian went out right away. I couldn\u2019t make myself go out for about a week. I was afraid to face the world. So finally we went out, one Sunday afternoon. Beautiful, sunny afternoon. My town, where I was born, where I went to school, I didn\u2019t know a living soul. And as we were walking, I said to Julian, where are we going? He says, I don\u2019t know, let\u2019s just walk. And as we were walking a man approached us. And he saw me, and he stood there and said, I don\u2019t believe it. Aren\u2019t you Isadore Salzburg\u2019s daughter? I said yes. Was a lawyer, Jewish lawyer. Said to us, where are you going? I said, I don\u2019t know, we don\u2019t have a place. He says, come with me, I just opened an apartment, it belonged to a Nazi. So we went with him. There were no beds, but it didn\u2019t matter. I slept on the desk, Julian slept on the floor. And this was our first apartment. And from that day on, I was going out every day, looking for Jews that came out from hiding. And our apartment was full of people in a very short time. You were \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t believe, we would spend entire evenings telling s \u2014 each other stories. Of course, I didn\u2019t have a penny to mours \u2014 to our soul. So I \u2014 one day I saw a woman coming out of hiding, and I could recognize them coming out of hiding a mile away, there was something about the \u2014 the way they were walking, like we did. And I \u2014I saw that woman coming out of hiding, and she was a wife of a lawyer, her husband died. And she came out of hiding, so I said, come with me. We Interview with Lena Jurand * August 15, 1998 had a \u2014 a-an apartment full of people. And she \u2014 the first thing she said to me, she took out some money, pocket money \u2014 paper money from her pocket and said, do you need any money\u201d It was so unimportant. Here, have some. And that was the first money we got. Then Julian joined the army, Polish army as a \u2014 as a physician."

After the war, as Julian didn\u2019t have anything else but one pair of pant and a shirt, and he was always a snappy dresser, he ask me to press his pants. I picked them up, and you know the European pants are finished with the belt of the same material. And as I picked them up, there was something stiff there. So I said to him, Julian, I cannot press it like that, there is something in that belt, you have to take it out. What do you think it was? Poison. And at that time I gave him such hell for telling me that he doesn\u2019t have it. I said, you promise, you don\u2019t keep your promise. I was angry at Interview with Lena Jurand \" August 15, 1998 him. He said, if I would have shown it to you, you would have taken it then. This way, you waited. And he took it out from his pants. That\u2019s a story, huh? He was a very good man. When they t \u2014 when he died they gave him a beautiful memorial at Saint Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital. He was clinical director there.

He was \u2014 he was the one who arranged everything for me, yeah. Strange. I never thought when I was young that I will go through such a war. What makes one crazy man do things?

And I \u2014 I thought they were a little bit too young to marry, but he insisted \u2014 they were both 20 \u2014 he insisted they get married. They got married, they had a little apartment near GW where he was going to medical school. And I thought everything was beautiful until about maybe six or seven months after they got married, he ask us to come over and we did. And she was sitting next to the window, and I says, what is it sweetheart? Interview with Lena Jurand \u00b0 August 15, 1998 Maybe we come here maybe too often, I thought, maybe it\u2019s too much for her. She says no, you know, I love you, but I just don\u2019t want to be married any more. And it was a terrific blow to him, really bad. She was the one who got the divorce and as far as I know, to this day she didn\u2019t remarry. So then he met this girl, and she\u2019s not Jewish. And he married her, and seem like a good marriage. She works for the World Bank. She\u2019s a good mother. I would have preferred marry a Jewish girl, but who am I to say something? And he seems to be working out very nicely. He took over the psychiatric division of the hospital in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and he directed now a play in the theater, he goes in his father\u2019s footsteps. And he wants me to move there. So I don\u2019t know what life will bring, whatever it is. And I think it\u2019s very nice of you to sit here and listen to me for such a long time. You must be exhausted."
