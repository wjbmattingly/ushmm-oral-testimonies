We had to leave the class and go to another, we Jewish girls. And we had a rabbi who came and gave us a lesson in religion. I liked the priest better, he was young and handsome. We had to stand up at the beginning of our classes and listen. Not say it, but li \u2014 stand in the respect of their prayer. And we had to stand up before we left for home. That was the only thing we had to do. Otherwise, we had our religion class. And we had a few Jewish teachers, even though it was a Catholic school. We didn\u2019t have nuns. The only \u2014 the only way they could prove that it was a Catholic school was that we had the prayer in the morning and the prayer in the afternoon, which we didn't participate in, we just stood and listened, and that was all. Was a very fine school, and a very fine education."

Now, we came to hide, we were hidden for 22 months, from November to August \u00b044. It was a kitchen, you entered, there was a little hall, and a pantry without the window. That pantry was very important. And then you entered the kitchen and there was one room behind the kitchen. There was no separate entrance to the room, it had to be through the kitchen.

I said, that\u2019s a good question. There was a fire in th \u2014 in the stove, constantly, and that fire helped. Whatever you had to burn, you burned. And the rest you pour out down the drain. So he was satisfied when I explained to him. I said, believe me, it wasn\u2019t easy. Julian developed such a magnificent sense of hearing that he knew what was going on in the kitchen before I knew it. From certain \u2014 he knew which \u2014 which place the floor was squeaking. One time an electrical man came to check the electricity. We didn't know he 1s coming. And of course he had to come to the room. So that was a \u2014 there was a mirror with a\u2014a piece of furniture with a mirror standing in the corner, but cutting off that corner, so one could hide behind it. Well Julian s \u2014 only heard the words, electricity, and he pointed to me to go behind that thing and he went under the bed. And the room had to look always unoccupied, always. He came in with her, and I heard her say [sighs]. And he looked at the ri \u2014 lamps or something, checked. And when he left, she came in and she says, good work guys. The first 10 months, because we accumulate a lot of things, of clothing in her house, she would sell 1t for us, and we would give her the money for the food. Well, after 10 months, my things have run out, and I told her, we don\u2019t have any money any more. So she was \u2014 she was very good about tt. When he didn\u2019t see, she would open the door and quickly push in a \u2014 a\u2014 a\u2014 some soup, let\u2019s say, or some bread. We ate very little, but whatever it was.

And I wouldn\u2019t stand at the window because I was afraid somebody might spot me. So I would kneel at the window and look at her. And I would say to Julian, what I wouldn\u2019t give to be this cow. I mean, people don\u2019t know what it means. 22 months. She worked for a German place. She spoke German. She didn\u2019t know how to read it, but she spoke German, for some reason she did. And once in awhile she would invite those German soldiers over for a party. So I help her cook and bake. And then we would hide in that pantry. And she would give them enough to \u2014 drinks to make them half drunk, and they would lie down on her bed and sleep. And when they were asleep, we would come in, go right near. I looked at them when they were asleep, and go to other room. When finally the war was almost over, there was a terrible fighting between the German and the Russian armies. Terrible fighting. The entire household went down to the basement, except us. So we were sitting in the pantry, and Julian kept his hands over my ears so I wouldn\u2019t hear that shooting. When suddenly the shooting stopped, and I said to Julian, am I crazy, or did I hear a Russian words there? At the moment when I said that, she opened the door and she said, you are free. The Russians are here, you can go out. There was no joy in me. Absolutely nothing. So I said \u2014 my reaction was, now I am going to sleep.

At least once without fear, and I slept 24 hours. Julian went out right away. I couldn\u2019t make myself go out for about a week. I was afraid to face the world. So finally we went out, one Sunday afternoon. Beautiful, sunny afternoon. My town, where I was born, where I went to school, I didn\u2019t know a living soul. And as we were walking, I said to Julian, where are we going? He says, I don\u2019t know, let\u2019s just walk. And as we were walking a man approached us. And he saw me, and he stood there and said, I don\u2019t believe it. Aren\u2019t you Isadore Salzburg\u2019s daughter? I said yes. Was a lawyer, Jewish lawyer. Said to us, where are you going? I said, I don\u2019t know, we don\u2019t have a place. He says, come with me, I just opened an apartment, it belonged to a Nazi. So we went with him. There were no beds, but it didn\u2019t matter. I slept on the desk, Julian slept on the floor. And this was our first apartment. And from that day on, I was going out every day, looking for Jews that came out from hiding. And our apartment was full of people in a very short time. You were \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t believe, we would spend entire evenings telling s \u2014 each other stories. Of course, I didn\u2019t have a penny to mours \u2014 to our soul. So I \u2014 one day I saw a woman coming out of hiding, and I could recognize them coming out of hiding a mile away, there was something about the \u2014 the way they were walking, like we did. And I \u2014I saw that woman coming out of hiding, and she was a wife of a lawyer, her husband died. And she came out of hiding, so I said, come with me.
