Not that it meant too much of a- how should I say -- really not miss anything because of that. It was different in my mother's parents' case. My mother's parents were the richest wholesalers in Watz [ph] where they lived, which changed drastically in the 1930s when my mother's sister married a man who ruined the families, so much so that they left the town and moved up to Budapest and didn't want to be seen and known by nobody that they are having financial problems they didn't have because their sons and daughters made sure that they should not miss anything, but, of course, they were not in the way they used to be and they were suffering -- they were ashamed not to live the life what originally was meant to be lived by them."

Yes, we were. True. That was our fault we were because we had no idea what they are going through. But even if they would we couldn't have believed it anyway. It was unbelievable for human beings that this is happening to the other human being.

Which probably was better suited for somebody who is soft and they didn't have to march out and back. That happened right on campus. And slowly we managed to get through this time.

We were just sitting out there and do nothing, but we had to be brought out and brought back. You have to go, you know.

There was a man on the pool side sitting all completely dressed up to his everything on him and was sitting there alone and looking ahead of him and doing nothing.

It was awful hard for him to understand that we still hope to see our husbands so we will go back to Hungary and not straight to America. And then from Hungary I wrote him and I got married to Andy. Probably not even then but right after that when I was already pregnant and yes and I asked him if they had any of the baby things left over after that first baby. I will very appreciate because there's practically nothing available here. Then I didn't hear of them. I knew that in November he went back, he gave address and what not and that's where we wrote. And we also sent a picture my girlfriend and me two of us a picture. But that was later. Because that ended everything. The package what came in was this large. I was seven months pregnant when that arrived one morning. It was some 80 pounds, huge. There was one piece on the top of it what was a huge piece which was kind of christening outfit. All the rest was packed in a department store. And the department store's paper was put on the top of it and they wished well. They sent me a robe, they sent me slippers. And we sent this picture to him. And by then he wrote of another baby. They have the second one. So Andy and I where we started to physically be in better shape we bought something but we thought it's a nice gift item and we had mailed two of it. One to his mother, and one to his wife. Not ever since then I got a word from them. Either they got hurt that I want to pay back what they did or God knows what now I don\u2019t know. Or the wife became jealous because seeing our pictures. Now we Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Suzanne Foldes 63 turned around from what Ralph had seen and I can very well imagine that she did not like that friendship. And since we are not going to become his sisters, I got married and my girlfriend got married the same time, same day under the same __ and we did not go to them. But the man there on that pool side fully dressed because he's an Orthodox Jew he wouldn't get undressed."

I still to this day I don't know how he knew, who mentioned that in front of him, or who else told him because we certainly did not. I couldn't imagine that I can hurt my child with pain like that I shall be telling all these what I was telling you or even more to him. I wanted to save him from that forever. I just couldn't bring myself to talk about that. The first time Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Suzanne Foldes 71 I was talking about all that was in 1990 we were sitting in front of the operating room and his father was operated on at Georgetown University Hospital where I first talked to him about where I'd been. He came home once earlier and said I belong to the second generation and they are encouraging us to ask you to give us oral history. And I jumped up from the chair where I was sitting I run out to the kitchen and he knew that he cannot ask me again about it. It's been much later in the \u201870s sometimes when I first was able to talk to non-Jewish people mentioning where I was. I kind of it just came out of me. It was I don't know what I wanted to do with them if I wanted to scare them or what I wanted. But I couldn't say that to anybody who was Jewish. I just didn't want to talk about it at all to Jewish people for years and years and years. And when they were talking about the Holocaust Museum my husband and I were both dead set against it. I couldn\u2019t see it. I still cannot understand it. I still feel to a certain degree that this is guilt money from the American government and from the American Jews. They all feel much easier to put the moneys into something than their hearts. And we will be always different. We cannot be understood by the Americans, and the Americans cannot be understood by us totally. I still have that bitterness. My -- I had a boss in the end of the \u201850s whose family also perished there. And says to me Suzanne you will have to tell me how my relatives perished. So at lunchtime when he was sitting on the switchboard and I was brown- bagging my lunch and was eating at the desk he said tell me. And so I started to tell him that ?Mr. Rosengarden? I don't know I didn't know your relatives so I don't know how they, I only can tell you what was the average. And I started to tell him and in three or four minutes he stopped me he said Suzanne don't say that it hurts too much. And I think Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Suzanne Foldes 72 this is what any American Jew feels. I spoke to quite a few just lately who said they don't want to go down to the museum. They don't want to see it. And they don't know nothing about it. There is a lady here who I appreciate very much as an intelligent, deep feeling, good person. A few months ago in somehow it came to me that she was asking about how Andy lost his wife. And I said well how, she had ?Steve? on her arm. She looked at me and I said don't you know that everyone who went there with child perished? No, I didn't know that. And I became so very, very angry on that that I wanted to organize a seminar here that a few people who I know were survivors should talk to these people. I don't want them to hear all the most awful things. I'm ready to tell them some story which probably makes them even smile sometime. But they should know some of the feelings we went through. They don't want to know it. So that's all I can tell you. Iam not a good person. I am still angry."

In our room in the camp which was the outskirts I mean the outer-lager of Buchenwald we had this little lady, the rabbi's wife, she kept on her head a turban constantly. Never removed it, never washed. It was full with lice. And we just decided that we won\u2019t get in danger because of her. And we decided she was never out working. She never came out.

The child of a non-Jewish mother who two years ago was his father and I were talking about something and his father was saying that only the two of us will be there who were born Jewish. Well, he meant me. And my grandson chimed in and me. He feels Jewish when he's with us. He's always spending the holidays with us. And then he spends the other holidays with his mother at her house and the grandparent's house. He's a sweetheart, he loves us dearly. I never talked to him about all this. I didn't dare and I was not encouraged later. However he was here a few months ago. And God knows how, he said something where I said did you go to see Schindler's List? Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Suzanne Foldes 76 And he said yes. And then he was completely wiped out by it. And I dared to ask which I had asked his father sometimes ago and he does not have the nerve to face the holocaust museum either. And I asked Michael and he said no he would like to go and want to go with his father. So I said if he wants to go would you tell me about it. And I asked if his school shouldn't go and he said it's a good idea probably it should. But then since then I haven't spoken to him about that. It felt good that now I know that he was. When his friends were bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs and we kept going to them. His father was asking me if he doesn't want to become this, then his grandfather was still alive. And he said to his father that he would have nothing against it except going up there. I just have to accept it this way. It hurts. He got the bigger birthday present on his 13th. We had given to him with telling him that if he was now Jewish he would have a mark on his birthday but without that a Jewish boy is bar mitzvah at 13 no matter what."
