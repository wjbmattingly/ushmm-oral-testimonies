But is the same God. And people need to \u2014 to believe in God, whatever it is. If they don\u2019t know, they even form belief that in several gods, or whatever, I don\u2019t know what Buddhists believe, and so on. But there is a tolerance, and it was tolerance in 127 Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 Poland. But here, right now, I \u2014 I \u2014 is my \u2014 my own saying, that et \u2014 atheists are not tolerant. They cannot tolerate cross somewhere on the street and somewhere. Maybe they feel guilty that they don\u2019t believe in God, but I don\u2019t see tolerance in this country, and everywhere. And Poland right now is \u2014 1s separate of state and \u2014 and \u2014 and I think it\u2019s going the same direction, lack of tolerance. And I\u2019m very dissatisfied with that, so I don\u2019t know whether people can change it again, back to religious tolerance. Well, we have Muslims in Poland, some gathering, they \u2014 they have the \u2014 right now they moved from east to west and so on, so it\u2019s more difficult, but those people were \u2014 Poland was always fighting Turks and \u2014 and Tartars, they were Muslims. So those people were taken prisoners, or were \u2014 they were always \u2014 they started as our enemies, fighting us. And right now we consider them just any other people. We don\u2019t have problem with \u2014 with Muslims right now in Poland."
