My husband was a mathematician, and he knew a mathematician in Poland who was very distinct in \u0152 in Warsaw Polytechnic. I forgot his name right now. And he was very respected, s-some grand or something like that, one year, and the second year they told him to get out of Poland, they allowed him.

But here, right now, I \u0152 I \u0152 is my \u0152 my own saying, that et \u0152 atheists are not tolerant. They cannot tolerate cross somewhere on the street and somewhere. Maybe they feel guilty that they don\u2122t believe in God, but I don\u2122t see tolerance in this country, and everywhere. And Poland right now is \u0152 is se parate of state and \u0152 and \u0152 and I think it\u2122s going the same direc tion, lack of tolerance. And I\u2122m very dissatisfied with that, so I don\u2122t know whether people can change it again, back to religious tolerance. Well, we have Muslims in Poland, some gathering, they \u0152 they have the \u0152 right now they moved from east to west and so on, so it\u2122s more difficult, but those people were \u0152 Poland was always fighting Turks and \u0152 and Tartars, they were Muslims. So those people were taken prisoners, or were \u0152 they were always \u0152 they started as our enemies, fighting us. And right now we consider them just any other people. We don\u2122t have problem with \u0152 with Muslims right now in Poland."
