And there was a danger in the ships going into Germany, they were down there to load coal for Denmark, and there was a danger of losing ships, losing personnel. So, you know, the whole thing changed.

But I forgot th -- what -- in there four or five times, something like that. And otherwise you sit out yourself, by yourself. So -- and that went on for -- I guess I was in that jail for a month. And then they came there one morning, I don\u2019t know, three o\u2019clock, told me to get dressed \u2014get my gear. We went out, got in a bus -- a-a -- this truck, then they took us down. And they took us down to just over the border, place called Flensburg and there were 13 of us, and that -- put us in the jail there for -- oh, I don\u2019t know, two or three days. And then they took us by bus to Hamburg to the jail and we were just there one day. And then they took us down to the concentration camp. And then it was strange because normally when you come down there, you get, you know, your prison number at that time was somewhere in the 50 - 60 thousands. Ours was 500, and that was because the 13 numbers were what they called politsi haftling. That means you are under arrest, but your sentence has not been determined yet. So, we were politsi haftling until somewhere around Christmas, and then we became Just a -- a normal, regular prisoner. But in the meantime, that helped me because one time my name was on a list, I was told, I forgot, but anyway, I found out that I was supposed to be transferred to one of the work camps, which they were building these trenches so the allied tanks couldn\u2019t get in. So you walk around in this water up to your knees or whatever. You never get dry clothes on, and it\u2019s cold, it was in the wintertime. So the fellows there usually didn\u2019t last very long. So I heard I\u2019d been transferred there once, I didn\u2019t like that, so I got permission to go up to the camp office, and I said to the clerk up there that I was politsi haftling, which means I had to be -- available again -- in -- in case Gestapo wanted me back and maybe he better not ship me off cause he could wind up and get in trouble. So he agreed, so he took me off the list, then some other poor bugger got on the list there. Then I really got transferred. But the reason for that was that one of the 13 had found This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.
