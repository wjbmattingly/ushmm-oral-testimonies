And then with a -- with boat, with train, walking, we went down to Koblenz and the Rhine went down to Heidelberg, and then we came back through Berlin, we came back to Copenhagen, about two weeks. The other vacations, when I worked for the steamship company they used to put -- put us on the ship as a deck boy and I\u2019d work on the ship for two or three weeks, to give you some idea about the practical part of the shipping.

Well, of course, I was down there in May of \u201939, in -- in the Germany, but then when the war started in September, and being in the shipping business, that made a whale ofa difference in -- in the way we had to operate. For one thing, there was a danger of -- of mines and -- and you know, torpedoes and all that stuff. And there was a danger in the ships going into Germany, they were down there to load coal for Denmark, and there was a danger of losing ships, losing personnel. So, you know, the whole thing changed.

You had to put extra lifesaving equipment on them, all those kinds of things. You had special instructions from -- from the military which -- where -- where to sail, where to avoid.

We \u2014 if y \u2014 if the country had bombers all over the place, and th-that -- the soldiers are coming in, there was -- the Germans were putting soldiers ashore at a number of points.

So I came back a week later on, he said okay, here\u2019s a -- a name of a guy, you could go and talk to him.

The other thing was driving around on a bicycle, if you see a bunch of people standing, say at a -- say at a bus stop, you throw a bunch of papers over there and then you peddle around the corner as fast as you can.

And you sit there, you handcuffed with your -- in the back and you have a -- a wire going through so nobody get anywhere.

So you stand there doing your thing and we knew that shortly before that the Germans -- the Gestapo had taken a bunch of fellows from the camp out somewhere in the northern part of Zealand and they shot them all. So when you\u2019re do -- standing there doing that thing, one of the German soldiers fired a -- a salvo, this machine pistol there. That was pretty scary.

I had bought a copy of the London Times, and I had that in my briefcase, and I was sitting the streetcar, and through one end of the streetcar come these German soldiers and start -- want to check everybody\u2019s briefcase.

But I forgot th -- what -- in there four or five times, something like that. And otherwise you sit out yourself, by yourself. So -- and that went on for -- I guess I was in that jail for a month. And then they came there one morning, I don\u2019t know, three o\u2019clock, told me to get dressed \u2014get my gear. We went out, got in a bus -- a-a -- this truck, then they took us down. And they took us down to just over the border, place called Flensburg and there were 13 of us, and that -- put us in the jail there for -- oh, I don\u2019t know, two or three days. And then they took us by bus to Hamburg to the jail and we were just there one day. And then they took us down to the concentration camp. And then it was strange because normally when you come down there, you get, you know, your prison number at that time was somewhere in the 50 - 60 thousands. Ours was 500, and that was because the 13 numbers were what they called politsi haftling. That means you are under arrest, but your sentence has not been determined yet. So, we were politsi haftling until somewhere around Christmas, and then we became Just a -- a normal, regular prisoner. But in the meantime, that helped me because one time my name was on a list, I was told, I forgot, but anyway, I found out that I was supposed to be transferred to one of the work camps, which they were building these trenches so the allied tanks couldn\u2019t get in. So you walk around in this water up to your knees or whatever. You never get dry clothes on, and it\u2019s cold, it was in the wintertime. So the fellows there usually didn\u2019t last very long. So I heard I\u2019d been transferred there once, I didn\u2019t like that, so I got permission to go up to the camp office, and I said to the clerk up there that I was politsi haftling, which means I had to be -- available again -- in -- in case Gestapo wanted me back and maybe he better not ship me off cause he could wind up and get in trouble. So he agreed, so he took me off the list, then some other poor bugger got on the list there. Then I really got transferred. But the reason for that was that one of the 13 had found out afterwards- said we had been sentenced to be hanged, and somehow or other the -- the instruction got lost, and that\u2019s the reason why we got into the camp, we got this strange number. The sentence had actually had been pronounced."

So that\u2019s when several white buses came down to the camp. First they collected a bunch of prisoners from other camps in Neuengamme, Norwegian and the Danish. Then the buses came down, and then they took all the prisoners up to a camp just north of the Danish German border, fa -- a place called Froslev So we come up there and we were there for a couple of days and then they took us by bus and they -- and train, we were supposed to go through Copenhagen and over to Sweden. But I didn't want to go back to Sweden. So just before the -- you get into Copenhagen there\u2019s fairly long hill.

We were there for maybe a week, and then the -- we were gonna go to Sweden. And as we came with these buses o-over the border to Denmark, the first place they took us to was a dairy. We could have all the milk we wanted. And not having had any milk for about eight month, and I drank a lot you really get a tummy ache. It sure tasted good. So then I got off the train in Copenhagen, and s -- I went over to somebody I knew down there and couple of days later I went and got the -- some I.D..

There were -- some of the worst fellows, some of them who would be shooting Danes for instance there-was some of that going on, too. They wound up, and the com - some of them got executed. They were shot. But I don\u2019t think there were more than 40 and 50 all told, like that. And then there were some that were put in jail.
