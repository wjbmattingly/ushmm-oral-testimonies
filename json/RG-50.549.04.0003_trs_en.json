This is an interview with Esther Dezube and her dog is also in the room, conducted by Regina Baier on December 7\", 2000, in Mrs. Dezube\u2019s home in Boston. Mrs. Dezube is the daughter of Amalie and Norbert -- Norman Salsitz, Holocaust survivors who have been interviewed for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\u2019s oral history collection. This interview is part of the USHMM\u2019s post Holocaust interview project. The US Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. Oh, be quiet. This is tape number one, side A. We are off to a good start here. So as I said, there is a dog with us in the room, but I think if we put her outside, it would be even louder, so hopefully our listeners will understand and even enjoy at times. My first -- my first question 1s, give us your full name, and when and where you were born.",

            "answer": "Well, it\u2019s hard to bring them to life, because I really never met them. But my first name is Esther, which is my father\u2019s mother\u2019s name. And I don\u2019t know a lot about her. I know a lot more about my father, and how he survived the war, but not so much about the personality of the mother, or the father, for that matter. My middle name is Cylia. That\u2019s after my mother\u2019s sister Cylia. I know a little bit about her. I know all the good qualities about her, and my mother seemed to adore her. I don\u2019t know a lot about her otherwise. And that\u2019s it. I actually -- my kids are named after survivors as well. And we did one other thing for our children. All their names equal 18, all the letters. They have 18 letters in their names. And 18 is a very special number in the Jewish religion, because it means chai, it means life. So we try to continue that on."

My bedtime stories were probably Holocaust stories. My father would sing me Yiddish songs, I remember that. My mother didn\u2019t read to me at night, my -- it was my father\u2019s -- not job, but that\u2019s what he liked to do. It -- it just didn\u2019t start, it was always there, they always talked about the Holocaust.

Is there anything that sort of comes to mind, that gives an impression of what it was. So their father sang to you, what -- what -- what else?",
            "answer": "Oh, he would tell me the -- I mean, that\u2019s what he would tell me, he would tell me about Hitler, and -- and -- and children being killed in the war. I think he learned actually to temper his stories as he got older. He would tell me, you know, the children\u2019s fats were made into soap. He would tell me that -- you know, his -- his n- nieces and nephews were killed and they were my age. He would say that -- it would even start with food. I was a very fat child, and they were very proud of it. They were proud that I was fat because they had enough food to give me and children were starving in the Holocaust. That I remember very distinctly, I was not allowed to leave the table without finishing all the food, because the children in the Holocaust were s - would starve, and I should appreciate all that."

            "answer": "Well, you\u2019ve got to understand something, 1s that one, I was an only child, so I had no one to bounce it off except my parents. Again, my parents really only associated with Holocaust survivors. I didn't know another world. It was the only world that I had. I was not a giggly kid. I never was a giggly kid. The kids used to play with -- I ne -- I didn\u2019t play with dolls very much. I played with maybe trolls, later on in life.

It affected me in other ways that I didn\u2019t have a family. It affected me that, you know, I saw my friends with grandparents and stuff like that. But the actual stories?

I didn\u2019t have to take a fairy tale and try to then say oh, I\u2019m going to transfer this fairy tale to something that happened in real life. These were presented as real life stories, that really happened to them. So I knew it was my parents. I knew it -- that everything belonged to them, that I was part of that history. And they kept telling me I was part of that history. That I should be a good Jew, I guess, because I am a -- because I was born, it was their fight against Hitler. I mean, I had to maintain that. That is something that I was brought up constantly. And I do tell my kids that, a -- a little bit, is that because I sur -- I -- I was born, and I survived a Jew, and I maintain it that I am victory over Hitler.

            "answer": "Well, you gotta understand, everybody has a dysfunctional family as far as I\u2019m concerned, there is no perfect home. I mean, you watch on TV, that\u2019s where you make your comparisons. And you always wanted to be like the family on TV, not so much like your friend\u2019s family, but the family on TV. Cause they always complained about their parents, too. I didn\u2019t have a close home life. My mother -- I was closer to my mother than my father, only cause my father wasn\u2019t home. My father is a very driven man. Probably is why he survived. But also, he was an immigrant in a country and he had to prove himself. So he would get up at 10 o\u2019clock in the morning, which Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Esther Dezube \u00b0 December 7, 2000 means I\u2019m already in school. He would come back from meetings at 10 o\u2019clock at night, and when I was young I was already in bed. He loved to listen to Yiddish mo -- music, which is not something that I liked. And on the weekends they would go a lot with their friends. I was a tagalong only because they didn\u2019t have a babysitter, and they would speak Polish, which 1s a language that I never learned. So I had to create my own world. I mean, I used to have dinner with my mother. She\u2019d u -- have the -- she loves the radio. So either she had music or news in the background. And she\u2019s very political oriented. And so she would always talk all about all the political situations and I had to always be a-abreast about it. And that would be our pul -- our - our life. My parents didn\u2019t really integrate with me. Maybe it\u2019s part of the inte -- European culture. But we didn\u2019t do -- we went on vacations. We\u2019d travel a lot. We didn\u2019t do a lot as a family, not that I can recall. My mother, again, she wouldn\u2019t take me shopping. She laughs at me when I say that. Oh well, you know, I took you on these trips instead of shopping. We didn\u2019t do the normal family stuff. My mother liked to read, and that\u2019s what she did. I don\u2019t recall us ever engaging 1n board games. I don\u2019t ever a -- we nev -- it was as if they were tired of life. And I couldn\u2019t relate. I mean, again, that\u2019s also fantasy. You know, board games and playing with a little kid. And they didn\u2019t know how to deal with it."

I was never showered with compliments. She may disagree with me, but that\u2019s my perception. I -- I always liked to draw and she always felt that that was beneath her as an occupation. I was accepted to art school, she was very angry. She said, as a vocation, not a -- as an advocation, not vocation.

A doctor can take their skills and go from one country to another and start again. And if I wasn\u2019t a doctor I wouldn\u2019t have those transferable skills. And that\u2019s why it was so important, even though math was never a strong point. And it was just not a subject that I excelled in. I was always on the debating team, I was on the speech team. It was very interesting, I mean, when I was young, that\u2019s where I lean. And you know, yet I agreed to be a pre-med student the freshman year of college. And then I realized it -- I loved taking care of people, but I couldn\u2019t get through the chemistry and the -- the physics and the trigonometry to get there. I mean, if it was just lab work, I got A\u2019s in biology lab work and stuff. So that\u2019s the freshman year of college she called me a failure. But when you have no other siblings, y-you have to achieve all the goals that your parent want. And that\u2019s what they wanted. I mean, they didn\u2019t see me as almost a person, but an extension of all their goals. I can see that now. Maybe when I was younger I resented it."

It\u2019s one of the reasons I left home, because I didn\u2019t want to have anger, I didn\u2019t want to have resentment, and I knew that distance would take care of that. They tried to totally dictate -- my mother, not my father -- cause she just was around more -- dictate my life.

They -- I -- I -- there was a cousin Leo, who -- my parents never made a Passover, which is -- I don\u2019t know if you want me to explain it, but it -- it -- Passover is the time when the Israelites left Egypt, and they lived in the desert. And the actual name started when God -- after the 10\" -- or the last plague, God said to put lamb\u2019s blood on the door of the Israelites, and then he would pass over their house, and we should retell the story in -- in the -- we call it the Bible, we don\u2019t have a fir -- a first testament and a second testament. Old Testament and New Testament, excuse me. But your equivalent of -- of the Old Testament, it\u2019s in there, and it says, you shall remember. So that is an very big holiday an-and it\u2019s a unique holiday because it\u2019s family oriented in the home. You don\u2019t go to temple, necessarily, for Passover. So my cousin Leo would always make it, even as a small kid I would go to Interview with Esther Dezube \" December 7, 2000 his house.

I am friendly with Leo\u2019s children, and Leo has a twin sister, and I\u2019m friendly with their children.

            "question": "Because you wanted to go, or because she wanted to go?",
            "answer": "She wanted to go. Well, she wanted to go because there was a man who helped save her life, his name was Mundek, and I -- he was very ill at the time. And my mother said that he was always in love with her. He never married. He\u2019d saved 12 girls. And she wanted me to meet him. And so my sophomore year of college I went to Poland, and at that time you couldn\u2019t go as a Jewish group to Poland. Didn\u2019t exist. You had to go with a Roman Catholic group, led by a priest to Poland. And that\u2019s how we went, and that\u2019s -- it was very interesting because I never told them in Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Esther Dezube \u201d December 7, 2000 the group that I was Jewish. I mean, I never brought it up. My mother didn't bring it up either. She basically said, you know, let us blend in right now. And I remember the priest took a liking to me, and he always tried to make me go to confession to all these different churches. And I kind of bowed out. And we had one week that we were spending with our friends, with the people that helped save my father, and the people who helped save my mother. But while we were in the tour group, there was also a -- a group, they were the fir -- there was a group of first Christians or something like that, they were from Ohio, and they don\u2019t cross themselves either, and they don\u2019t go into confession. So I kind of said I -- I can\u2019t do that, or whatever. And he had no clue that I was Jewish, none. And there was a woman there who right away everybody knew she was Jewish. She also had a -- she was from Auschwitz, so she had the symbol. But even before, they kind of knew. They used to tell Jewish jokes on the bus, and they still made fun of Jews. Hardly any Jews in Poland at the time and they still made fun of us. And I -- and I knew then how my mother felt. I used to wear a Moses holding the 10 commandments. I wore it on the inside. It was very interesting. Then we spent a week with the families. And I met Mundek, but we couldn\u2019t talk to each other. But he was if -- there was like a light in his eyes. He was a very interesting, very nice man. But I spent -- we stayed at the house that -- of the woman who saved my father, because she had a house in Warsaw. And she had two children my age. We couldn't speak very well, but they all kind of -- if they knew that Interview with Esther Dezube * December 7, 2000 I was Jewish, it was just never brought up. Holocaust was never brought up, never discussed it. There was a language barrier. But there was one boy who came over who did bring it up. And -- and we liked each other. And I said to him, by the way, do you know that I was Jewish? I had to tell him, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s -- something compelled me that I had to tell him who I was. And he said to me, we\u2019re all children of Moses. But he was the only one of the group who went to the university. So it was very different, but I felt very strange there. You know, you would o -- go with other pe -- I would not -- I mean, he knew I was Jewish. And of course, I thought the other children knew because of what their parents told them. But it\u2019s just not -- I was told in some parties not to bring it up. And then we went, you know, to see my father\u2019s house. And I felt -- then I felt anger, because I couldn\u2019t -- here was my father\u2019s house, that didn\u2019t belong to him any more, that was taken from him, and I wanted to go up to these people and say, this is my heritage. My mother told me, you know, obviously, not to do that, not to bring it up, not even to mention we went to a restaurant to have tea. No one questioned my mother, whether she was Jewish, no one thought about it, and I guess I don\u2019t look that Jewish. It was not imprinted across my forehead. But at the end of the trip was the most interesting part because I sat next to the priest on one of the planes. And I showed -- he said, where do you go to school, and I said I went to BU, and on my I.D. was the Jewish star. And he looked at that, and you could see his eyes were widening, and he turned around, and he said, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Esther Dezube \u00bb December 7, 2000 \u201cThat -- that looks like a Jewish star.\u201d I said, \u201cIt is.\u201d He said, \u201cAre you Jewish?\u201d And I said, \u201cI am.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, I like you anyway.\u201d And I think to him, he thought he was giving me a compliment. But, you know, there are two ways to approach those kind of people, yell and screaming, butt your heads, not get anywhere. Shake your head, and be polite. Show them that you can be better than they. And then other ways, press your point. And I -- and I think that\u2019s the way that I usually do it."

And he said that the hol -- that the Jews were viewed that way too, and if we don\u2019t stand up for these people, who would sta - who stood up for the Jews? We have to stand up for these people so that doesn\u2019t happen again. And that\u2019s why he went into that field. And I\u2019ve had to write many letters to the hospitals that tried to take his -- his room away, and all sorts of Interview with Esther Dezube * December 7, 2000 interesting dynamics. But he fought on and he wrote [indecipherable], and he do -- he loves his field. Does research and sees patients too, at the same time. And I went into plaintiff law. I never in my life considered being defense, ever. Because the plaintiff was always the underdog. I never considered -- there\u2019s many different areas of trial law, corporate law, or my father wanted me to be a real estate lawyer. Just wasn\u2019t for me cause it didn\u2019t involve dealing with people, and protecting victim\u2019s rights. That was important to me that I protect them against -- and I -- and I view the insurance companies as people who -- or companies who take advantage of people. And I wouldn\u2019t let that happen to me, it would go against my grain. So when I try a case, a little [indecipherable] of that is in me. It makes it easier when you try a case that way. I won\u2019t take cases that I feel th-the people aren\u2019t trying -- you know, telling the truth. I -- I -- I -- I really make it a point that I want to be respected in my field. I can\u2019t be a top trial lawyer, because I have children and you have choices in life to make. And I made the choice that my family does come first. And I\u2019m not unhappy with that choice."

And he didn\u2019t object that I named them after my side of the family. He kind of understood that it was important to keep their names alive. And I credit him for that. And 18 is something they do in their Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Esther Dezube \u201c\u00b0 December 7, 2000 family. And I felt 1t was just a wonderful idea, so that I incorporated it, some of -- like the spelling of Isaac is a little off, but it\u2019s 18. Aaron Richard, and then his Hebrew name is Aaron Raphael. Aaron 1s after his grandfather, but even my parents liked his grandfather, and I don\u2019t th -- and he had just died, so it actually fit in very well, but Raphael is -- is after Rachel, my father\u2019s sister. Richard. And Michael -- actually we had a little problem with Michael\u2019s name, my mother wanted Frederick, and I just couldn\u2019t see naming my child Frederick. Now, we thought even Forest, they told me they wouldn\u2019t even call him by name if he -- his name was Forest. They call my son, by the way, instead of Dustin, Dodson, on purpose cause they didn\u2019t like the name.

            "answer": "It\u2019s like when I went to a Schecter meeting and there was another woman there and we talked. And I found out she was a survivor -- a child survivor, and we just knew that each other were child survivors, it\u2019s some -- maybe our outlook on life. We\u2019re a little more serious, maybe. Probably a little more warped. Family, I think, Interview with Esther Dezube *\u00b0 December 7, 2000 for child survivors are very important. I find that is a unifying fact in every one of the child survivors that I\u2019ve met. There\u2019s this woman now from Israel, that we met through another family, child surviv -- you know, survivor, and we\u2019re -- we\u2019re close, it just -- I know what you\u2019ve gone through, I know the stories that you\u2019ve gone through. I know that, you know, your parents always say that, you know, we didn\u2019t have this and you do. And we\u2019re doing all this for you cause we have no one else. You just know. And you know that either you\u2019re going to resent your parents for it, or you try to deal with it. I don\u2019t resent them for who they are. Maybe when I was younger a little bit. I can understand that they went through hell, and that I\u2019m just going to have to be accepting of who they are. I\u2019m not going to be able to change them. You know, for many years you try to change somebody, and you realize you can\u2019t do that. So you either respect them, or you distance yourself, or you want to have nothing to do with them, those are the three choices. When you don\u2019t have a family, that\u2019s not an option. They\u2019re the only things that I have to a family, so it\u2019s just not an option. And so that\u2019s why I keep telling my kids, this is all we have. We don\u2019t have anybody else. You have to stand up for each other. You have to stick together. That kind of bonding I\u2019m not sure is in a regular family. Everybody else is doing their own thing and not -- I tell the brothers, you better protect each other. Who else do you have? You know, you better understand, you may not like what [indecipherable] have to do. They come in and my father will scream at them, Interview with Esther Dezube December 7, 2000 they\u2019re not wearing socks. And they say, we\u2019re not cold. And that we\u2019re bad children because we don\u2019t tell our kids to wear socks when they command it. But I tell them, you know, you have to understand from where they\u2019re coming from. Put yourselves in their shoes. I don\u2019t know whether or not if you\u2019re not a survi -- child survivor that you can understand that. Or if you\u2019re not gone through that kind of generation, I don\u2019t know."

I want to fit in. I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m co -- more closely to a lin -- aligned to these people be-because they\u2019re Americans, but you know, if you also associate with survivors, you tend to bring it up a lot more. That means you\u2019re reliving it and reliving it and reliving it. And I don\u2019t want to do that. When the articles come out on my parents, I\u2019m proud, I-I show them to my kids, and they read them. The little one is proud because his father is famo -- grandfather, you know, 1s famous, he looks at it that way, and you know -- my father goes, well, that\u2019s not a good enough reason. I said, let him bond that way. When he\u2019s older he can develop Interview with Esther Dezube ~ December 7, 2000 other -- a-and Dustin is much more respective of my parents now as he\u2019s older and understands more. So I see that the time is coming. They don\u2019t see that. They had no parents. They had no parents who ever butt into their lives, so they don\u2019t understand when or when not to butt into our lives. They just never had any mentors. So -- a-and that\u2019s why we sent them to Schecter, to be proud of their heritage, of who they are. And again, to make sure that it won\u2019t happen again to them. And I think they see that. I mean, my -- my middle one will go into a restaurant, very -- very -- and say, hey, there\u2019s Christmas stuff, but there\u2019s no Hanukkah stuff, why? I don\u2019t think an American kid would really pay attention to that. So it has sunk in a little bit, you know? I mean, maybe not the way that my parents -- but he\u2019s very proud of who he is. He\u2019s very proud that he\u2019s Jewish. It was difficult cause my oldest son was dating a non-Jew. I think my mother was much more willing to see -- let\u2019s wait and see, my father went -- still goes bananas over it. Absolutely goes banana -- has major battles with my son."

I don\u2019t. Then they\u2019re as good as anyone else. Because I think part of our heritage would be lost. And I -- and I am Interview with Esther Dezube ~ December 7, 2000 very close to that. I mean, my son\u2019s Bar Mitzvahs -- you know, when you have a kid who lives in an affluent society and he\u2019s having a Bar Mitzvah, it\u2019s very difficult to have him not focused on what gifts I\u2019m going to get, versus, do you understand what this mean? That this 1s a tradition that you are perpetuating over thousands of years. That if you\u2019re not proud of who you are as a Jew, people will step on you. Maybe an American doesn\u2019t understand that. And I look. If somebody\u2019s talking about Jews, or saying something and I hear it in the background, I'll speak up. I\u2019m very proud of this person, his name is Lenny Zakim. He died of a brain tumor last year, he was 47- t-two years ago, almost. They\u2019re actually debating to name a -- the new bridge in Boston after him. He was part of the ADL, and he went to law school with me [indecipherable] was -- he was a year ahead. I wasn\u2019t socially -- we were not on social basis, but we always used to say hello to each other from the same law school. And he would really go around, and make sure about anti-Semitism and stuff. But it was only -- not only anti-Semitism, it was anti blacks, anti anybody who had issues. And I think I\u2019m instilling that in my kids, about discrimination. That\u2019s a product of the Holocaust. It\u2019s not only discrimination that you\u2019re Jewish, and believe me, I\u2019ve had some anti-Semitism, I haven\u2019t had a lot. My kids haven\u2019t had so much, so they don\u2019t know yet what it is, but they will, and I want them to be prepared for it.

I had eight miscarriages -- no- yeah, eight miscarriages, three live births. And I think part of that keeping me going, although I would get almost hives when I would go into the op -- the -- the -- the gynecologist\u2019s office was that I really wanted a family th -- to perpetuate our heritage. That was very important to me. So I just didn\u2019t give up. And they know that. I mean, I sing Shema to them every night, and even my s -- oldest one still asks for that. To understand, you know, that this is where it\u2019s coming from.

            "question": "One other question until I remember another one, is sort of political. You have gone through, in your teens actually, Civil Rights movement, Women\u2019s movement, all of these things kind of are also part of who you are to some degree at least. To Interview with Esther Dezube \" December 7, 2000 what kind of degree? What -- what -- what moved you, politically speaking? What was important to you?",
            "answer": "Justice. I was for the Women\u2019s movement for equality and for justice. I don\u2019t go over backwards on it. I mean, I don\u2019t want any more rights, but I want to be respected. I am -- I\u2019ve dealt with that personally. I was a women\u2019s lawyer where they were just starting to have women lawyers. I mean, there were men in my class, but the older men didn\u2019t have women in their classes. I was called deary during trials. And -- and -- and my theory in life, as I handle almost everything with that one is somebody goes -- this one woman that was just outraged that he was calling me deary, aren\u2019t you going to say anything to him? And I said, no, because I\u2019m not going to change him. But if I\u2019m a deary, I\u2019m stupid, so I\u2019m going to take it to my advantage, and just prepare. And I won that trial. And my basic thing is I start off with honey. Burn me and you\u2019re in trouble. And then [ll y -- rant, rave and scream, but I usually don\u2019t rant, rave and scream first, cause I saw my parents rant -- my father rant, raving and screaming. I\u2019m not sure that he was better off for it. I had a -- I was pregnant with my first child and they told me I was unfit to try the case. Not the judge, but an attorney on the other side, because I would be going to the bathroom too much. He was a black attorney. The judge threw -- it was Christmas eve, the judge threw it out, and said I\u2019m not touching this -- at least he was wise enough -- I\u2019m not touching this one. It\u2019s much better for the younger women attorneys, I Interview with Esther Dezube \u00b0\" December 7, 2000 guarantee you. They didn't have to fight that. I campaigned when I was in college, for Scoop Jackson. I went around and I did a lot of political planning, but a -- it was a -- politics 1s a very dirty animal. I didn\u2019t like the dirt. So I -- and especially for a woman, it\u2019s much e -- more of a dirty animal. I fight for justice wherever it is. For special education and stuff like that. I\u2019m an independent. I\u2019m registered as an independent, because then I\u2019m not locked in the primary to vote for a Republican or Democrat, and I wanted to see where my vote counts. So I\u2019m more of that. I mean, I hear what\u2019s going on with Gore and -- and I\u2019m outraged because I think that there were a lot of shenanigans going on and the people\u2019s votes weren\u2019t counted. It\u2019s not so much Gore as a person to win, or Bush, though I think Bush 1s an idiot. But the fact is that these people were turned away from voting, these votes didn\u2019t count. And that gets my gall. It\u2019s the underdog again, that gets my gall. I\u2019ve rallied for Israel. I don\u2019t do it so much now. I\u2019m a little more laid back now than I used to be, but that\u2019s the only way I can handle my work load and my kids. Cause I don\u2019t have three wallflowers. I mean, sometimes I wish for three wallflowers, but I don\u2019t have them. And I want to make sure that they grow up to be people that give to the community, that\u2019s important to me. They give something of themselves to the community. My oldest son gave 10 percent of his Bar Mitzvah money to charity, to the Home of Little Wanderers. That was -- I didn't care which charity, but it was imperative that he gave. My youngest one says, I know, I have to give. So at least I -- you know, Interview with Esther Dezube \u201c December 7, 2000 good. You\u2019re going to have to give. And he chose -- you know, he\u2019s gonna choo -- he chose that Home for Little Wanderers, so he\u2019s going to give. That\u2019s important, for my kids to give back to the community and not always take. It\u2019s not easy, especially when you live in an affluent community. But my oldest one works at a soup kitchen. Third week of the month he cooks and he delivers. My youngest one -- my middle one does a little bit. My youngest one has to be pushed a little. He\u2019s probably not as giving at the others. But we\u2019re working on it."

            "answer": "I think part of the Holocaust children don\u2019t want -- do not want to be seen as different, a-although we are. We want to be normal. I don\u2019t know what normal is, but we want to be normal. And the only problem is our viewpoint of normalcy comes from a different plane than other people. I think that we carry -- we\u2019re a bridge, we really are. And we carry the torch to our younger generation, our kids, to make sure that they don\u2019t forget. And it\u2019s very hard, because unless they\u2019re living with their grandparents, they can\u2019t understand as much, and you do, so you don\u2019t know what to do. You understand where they\u2019re coming from, because they\u2019re removed and you understand where you parents are coming from, because you lived with it.
