He has written many literature books, so he -- after my husband died, he advised me to continue college to be able to teach Italian. But unfortunately, I was unable. I had four children, you know, and lost -- already engage d, you know, and there were in university. And I had a very little one; after 14 years, I had a little boy, Robert , who is now 30 years old. So I had to follow him; it was too much for me to continue. So that influenced a lot because, you know, my education. Besides that, you know, I had -- I became more religious, I would say, ever. You know, I don't go much to synagogue or things like that, but my feelings are so deep now, I feel that I've been so honor ed to talk about what happened to me because I have nightmares, still have nightmares, you know, of what happened to -- especially to my cousin Julia who, you know, died with a husband and two small children, Carla and Needa (ph); they were only five and three years old. And I constantly pray for them, you know. And th is kept me, you know, in my faith. All sisters tried to convert me; I would never, never, never, never, never. And that's very important to me. My family now, they're a ll married. My young one is married to a Korean, but he got married in the Jewish faith. My other son is married to an Irish, but he has kept his faith. My other sons, you know, he kept his faith. And also if we don't show, I hope that I have, you know, taught this to my children that, you know, how important it is. I don't care what's, you kno w, they're outside going to synagogue or serving, what the faith will be, and that's very important. Also, you know, I appreciate the fact that this brought me to live in this country. I go of ten to Italy, but I could not live there anymore. I feel that this country gives the opportunity, you know, to keep your faith, to work. I didn't have any educ ation, but I was able always to support myself. My husband didn't leave me rich, but I was able, you know, to have all my children have their degree and their professions. And I could never have accomplished if I had stayed in Italy. I myself, you know, I decided office work wasn't for me, and I took care of my catering and my chef work, and I been very successful. So thank God for America."
