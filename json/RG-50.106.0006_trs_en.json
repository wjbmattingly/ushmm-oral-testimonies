There was no transportation at that point; there were only, you know, Germans going out, you know, like a war in the city, impossible to walk. So I called my mother and my father, and I say, \"What should I do?\" Do you think you should try to go to your sister, maybe you would stay; you know, they live in an apartment, should be safe.

We didn't know. But I was not wanted there.

You know, and I run, you know. I stopped somebody, and I said, \"Please take me.\" You know, where I say please, please don't bother me, just to reach my house. I have to do it by myself. And finally, you know, I reached the convent, and I collapsed on the ground, but the nuns came out, you know, and they took me inside. And I decide that I didn't want to sleep alone, so I had these two very dear friends; they were two old Jewish lady, and they were so nice to me. And they say stay in our room, and I stayed and I spent the night there. And, finally, you know, when I woke up in the morning, I could not believe it that when we look out the window, we saw soldiers that they didn't look like Germans; in fact, they were the Americans.

Later on I went to Queens College, and I continue. My brother-in-law is the head of the Department -- Italian Department, Queens College. Maybe you have read his book, Sergio Pacifici. He has written many literature books, so he -- after my husband died, he advised me to continue college to be able to teach Italian. But unfortunately, I was unable. I had four children, you know, and lost -- already engaged, you know, and there were in university. And I had a very little one; after 14 years, I had a little boy, Robert, who is now 30 years old. So I had to follow him; it was too much for me to continue. So that influenced a lot because, you know, my education. Besides that, you know, I had -- I became more religious, I would say, ever. You know, I don't go much to synagogue or things like that, but my feelings are so deep now, I feel that I've been so honored to talk about what happened to me because I have nightmares, still have nightmares, you know, of what happened to -- especially to my cousin Julia who, you know, died with a husband and two small children, Carla and Needa (ph); they were only five and three years old. And I constantly pray for them, you know. And this kept me, you know, in my faith. All sisters tried to convert me; I would never, never, never, never, never. And that's very important to me. My family now, they're all married. My young one is married to a Korean, but he got married in the Jewish faith. My other son is married to an Irish, but he has kept his faith. My other sons, you know, he kept his faith. And also if we don't show, I hope that I have, you know, taught this to my children that, you know, how important it is. I don't care what's, you know, they're outside going to synagogue or serving, what the faith will be, and that's very important. Also, you know, I appreciate the fact that this brought me to live in this country. I go often to Italy, but I could not live there anymore. I feel that this country gives the opportunity, you know, to keep your faith, to work. I didn't have any education, but I was able always to support myself. My husband didn't leave me rich, but I was able, you know, to have all my children have their degree and their professions. And I could never have accomplished if I had stayed in Italy. I myself, you know, I decided office work wasn't for me, and I took care of my catering and my chef work, and I been very successful. So thank God for America."
