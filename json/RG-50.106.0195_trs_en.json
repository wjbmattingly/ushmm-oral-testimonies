My mother\u2122s thing was that it was all past, that you couldn\u2122t bring people back and there was simply no point.

And the daughter of one of the sisters all moved in with us. In this duplex apartment. My mother\u2122s mother would go every single day and visit her two brothers and their families who live d, who had moved into some other part of the ghetto. And one day she simply didn\u2122t come back. She just disappeared. I found a reference to one of her, one of her brother\u2122s daughters in Ringelb lum\u2122s diary about a twelve year old girl and her death was in there. One of the few \u0152 Her maiden name was Batlaj which is a Lithuanian name, B -A-T-L-A-J, L being a Polish. It\u2122s an L with a diagonal through it. So that is \u0152 and the widow of one of the brothers, of Henry Batlaj , did survive the war with two children and ended up in France, where my parents never really contacted anyone after. They tried but they couldn\u2122t. But in recent years, thanks to the internet, I\u2122ve been able to find out that they eventually seem to have al l become scientists and one of the women who by now must be the third generation, was Interview with Susanne K. Bennet 7 actually a visiting professor at Harvard about four or five years ago. And I asked my mother if I could contact her. And my mother just didn\u2122t want to. She wanted you know. Anyway, my, my aunt on my father\u2122s side and my cousin who was about 13 and the uncle, one uncle, the one who had been educated at Zwi ckau , one of his fellow engineering students was a German commandant. And he, they ran into each other in the ghetto and he arranged for them to work in a factory outside the gates, which was supposed to be a slightly protected situation so that every day they would all go out to work. And every day they\u2122d be checked back in. My mother was part of the group."

My father I mean I think my mother was under the impression that this man really had tried to protect them somewhat, but there was nothing that could be done. They, and I don\u2122t know his name. But you know they simply would clear the factories out and send the next batch out was the way it was done . My mother when that happened, which was the beginning of 43, my father had sort of, I mean no one really believed the Germans were going to do this. I mean no one, very few people left Poland because they, when it was about to happen because they just didn\u2122t, I mean no one believed there was such a thing as an extermination program, obviously."

And my father found his body with a portfolio of his chalk drawings lying next to it. And he managed to actually get that out of the ghetto and it survived the war. He returned most of them to a distant relative of Kromsztyk \u2122s. I have a couple of them. He was the first person that , my father did talk about him. He was the first person he knew that he saw dead you know in the ghetto. Kromsztyk had done some drawings which I have one of upstairs, where he, of figures in the ghetto. I don\u2122t know how many of them survived but this one was of a woman lyin g either asleep or dead. It\u2122s unclear. On the steps of one of the buildings in the ghetto.

I remember beggars, you know on the streets coming into the buildings and I remember this was really an awful, there was a man who came into our building to beg and we had stairs in the building which were very much like the kind of metal etched stairs that you have in a lot of schools. You know the old fashioned, and I remember them very distinctly. The man upstairs from us shoved this poor guy down the stairs and I remember that. I mean that really you know I asked my mother about it when I was a teenager and she said yes, that it had happened. You had this very large gap at the beginning between the people who considered themselves very middle class and the very, very poor people who were pushed in from the outside, you know the little ghettoes outside. And these people did not feel they had anything in common with them. And they were trying to keep what little they had for their own families which was the case up there. But I remember my grandmother would actually apparently would give this man money. And then he, or, or and food and then he went on upstairs. And this was what happened. So I remember that.

And then back it would come and my father would take it home because he was thrilled to be able to do this for Kennedy who he thought was wonderful. And he didn\u2122t want to sell the things that he, you know he kept them . My mother especially liked Bobby Kennedy who actually liked her a lot and would bring her gifts from his trips which was kind of fun. It was sort of amazing you know.

And what Interview with Susanne K. Bennet 57 was very interesting to me at that time was she also read about Emmet Till and she was flabbergasted that that had happened so recently. She wasn\u2122t aware of how recently the whole civil war battle ha d been fought and I told her that my senior year in high school we had come down here with my international relations club, my teacher, for a visit to Washington. We actually met with Nixon believe it or not who was then up on the Hill. And when we showed up at our hotel, we were turned away because we had two Puerto Rican girls in our group. This was in 1955. And my daughter could not believe it. You know she just was that it was that recent ly. And so we just marched down to the local Y and stayed there. And the whole group of us. It was a lesson for us because we had never at Hunter been the least bit aware of anybody being different. And just had never thought about it. Just as at Wellesley. I mean since then I\u2122ve found that a lot of the Catholic girls stuck together which I was not aware of particularly at the time. But we never really talked religion either. In college, in those days in the 50s. W e talked politics and we got into battles about politics. I mean John Kennedy was running for presid ent at the end there and he came to Wellesley and spoke and so forth. And one of the people in my class was Eisenhower\u2122s Secretary of Defense\u2122s daughter. For example. And was a rabid Republican. So we talked about things like that. We talked about our majors. We talked about our dates, but we didn\u2122t talk about religion. I mean I think some people did but never any of my friends, who are still my friends from college and whom I still see regularly."

            "answer": "Yeah when my son was there, my younger son was there for the New York Times. It was during the Intifada so things were very closed down. I feel very apprehensive about what\u2122s Interview with Susanne K. Bennet 64 going to happen to Israel. I feel that they have made some very serious mistakes in how they treat the Palestinians. And what I saw when I was there was pretty god awful and it simply made me think that they were doing the same thing that the Germans had done with the Jews in making them non-people. You know at one point, at one of the check points which were really set up massively during the Intifada , I saw some soldiers being absol utely horrible to a couple of old Palestinian men. And that brought back memories. And they have you know totally ghettoized them. I think in the end if Israel wants to continue to be there they have to develop a relationship and a decent relationship with the Palestinians. And you know even realizing that the Arabs have deliberately kept the Palestinians living in the situation which they are as a provocation to Israel, even realizing all of these things, I think that Israel has become very, very conserva tive in recent years. I was amazed to find when I was there, I \u2122m trying to remember what year it was that James was there. The majority of Israelis at that point were either middle east, I mean born in Arab countries or from Russia. So they had grown up in countries where in countries where in the Middle East where religion and government were completely intertwined. Which was not a good thing for Israel. They were trying to have the same thing happen in Israel. And I knew I mean when I was growing up in New York Teddy Kollek would come and visit my parents. Moshe Dayan would come and visit and so forth, and they were secular people. And they understood. You know they were Jewish but they understood the need for se cular government and not to have religion be the one that ran the government. And I think this is an enormous danger now in Israel . I mean you have people who are so unaware of their own history I think in many ways. And treating people the way they are treat ing the Palestinians who are of cou rse an enormous danger to them. Only makes it more dangerous. Interview with Susanne K. Bennet 65"

I think one of the best books is actually, well one is Never to Forget which is not fiction. And the other is a little book of fiction called Frederich which is about a little Jewish boy in Germany.
