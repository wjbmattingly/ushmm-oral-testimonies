Sort of an early reformer. And that\u2019s about it, because my parents were around in the early 30s, when the war broke out. My mother was 31. And that was rather early to have bothered to talk to their parents about you know their own families."

            "answer": "We, my mother and father both, my father never spoke about the war. And my mother didn\u2019t speak about it very much either. In fact one of the few times she talked about it was when my daughter was taking an ethics course in high school and asked her some questions. They never wanted to talk about it. My mother\u2019s thing was that it was all past, that you couldn\u2019t bring people back and there was simply no point. The only things they did talk about was that they, they refused to apply for any reparations when that came up because they felt that there was no, there was no way you could make reparations for what had happened. My father would sometime talk a little bit about his family but it was always prewar vacations, that sort of thing. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Susanne K.

            "answer": "Well middle, whatever. Like most professional, Jews of the professional class in Warsaw, they were educated abroad because the university had a tiny quota of Jews. So my father went to the Sorbonne. My mother went to Lucerne and my uncles, most of them were educated actually in Germany, in Zwickau. And so forth."

            "answer": "When the Germans first took over the ghetto area and expanded it and pushed everybody in, my parents traded their house with this artist friend who had a duplex apartment in a building which became part of the ghetto. He was not a Jew. And my father moved us and his whole family \u2014 his mother, his sisters, brothers, and a niece who was my generation. And my mother\u2019s mother into that duplex apartment."

            "answer": "My parents, my grandmother on my mother\u2019s side. And my grandfather on my father\u2019s side died just before the war and was buried in the Jewish cemetery near the ghetto. He died a natural death before the war. Not natural but I mean \u2014 so his mother, my father\u2019s mother and his three sisters, two brothers. The husband of one of the sisters. And the daughter of one of the sisters all moved in with us. In this duplex apartment. My mother\u2019s mother would go every single day and visit her two brothers and their families who lived, who had moved into some other part of the ghetto. And one day she simply didn\u2019t come back. She just disappeared. I found a reference to one of her, one of her brother\u2019s daughters in Ringelblum\u2019s diary about a twelve year old girl and her death was in there. One of the few \u2014 Her maiden name was Batlaj which 1s a Lithuanian name, B-A-T-L-A-J, L being a Polish. It\u2019s an L with a diagonal through it. So that is \u2014 and the widow of one of the brothers, of Henry Batlaj, did survive the war with two children and ended up in France, where my parents never really contacted anyone after. They tried but they couldn\u2019t. But in recent years, thanks to the internet, I\u2019ve been able to find out that they eventually seem to have all become scientists and one of the women who by now must be the third generation, was https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Susanne K. Bennet T actually a visiting professor at Harvard about four or five years ago. And I asked my mother if I could contact her. And my mother just didn\u2019t want to. She wanted you know. Anyway, my, my aunt on my father\u2019s side and my cousin who was about 13 and the uncle, one uncle, the one who had been educated at Zwickau, one of his fellow engineering students was a German commandant. And he, they ran into each other in the ghetto and he arranged for them to work in a factory outside the gates, which was supposed to be a slightly protected situation so that every day they would all go out to work. And every day they\u2019d be checked back in. My mother was part of the group."

            "answer": "Yes. Probably not the same factories. I don\u2019t know. It was sewing I think in the case of the women. And one day they simply didn\u2019t come back, any of them. My father I mean I think my mother was under the impression that this man really had tried to protect them somewhat, but there was nothing that could be done. They, and I don\u2019t know his name. But you know they simply would clear the factories out and send the next batch out was the way it was done. My mother when that happened, which was the beginning of 43, my father had sort of, I mean no one really believed the Germans were going to do this. I mean no one, very few people left Poland because they, when it was about to happen because they just didn\u2019t, I mean no one believed there was such a thing as an extermination program, obviously."

I mean there were, one of the first people that my father found killed in the ghetto was a close friend of his named Roman Kromsztyk who was a very well-known Polish artist. And my father found his body with a portfolio of his chalk drawings lying next to it. And he managed to actually get that out of the ghetto and it survived the war. He returned most of them to a distant relative of Kromsztyk\u2019s. I have a couple of them. He was the first person that, my father did talk about him. He was the first person he knew that he saw dead you know in the ghetto. Kromsztyk had done some drawings which I have one of upstairs, where he, of figures in the ghetto. I don\u2019t know how many of them survived but this one was of a woman lying either asleep or dead. It\u2019s unclear. On the steps of one of the buildings in the ghetto. And I was the model for the baby lying next to her, which I, it\u2019s hard to tell whether they\u2019re alive or dead in the drawing. I have it upstairs."

            "answer": "But I did remember the walls going up. And at what point that happened I\u2019m not sure. I remember beggars, you know on the streets coming into the buildings and I remember this was really an awful, there was a man who came into our building to beg and we had stairs in the building which were very much like the kind of metal etched stairs that you have in a lot of schools. You know the old fashioned, and I remember them very distinctly. The man upstairs from us shoved this poor guy down the stairs and I remember that. I mean that really you know I asked my mother about it when I was a teenager and she said yes, that it had happened. You had this very large gap at the beginning between the people who considered themselves very middle class and the very, very poor people who were pushed in from the outside, you know the little ghettoes outside. And these people did not feel they had anything in common with them. And they were trying to keep what little they had for their own families which was the case up there. But I remember my grandmother would actually apparently would give this man money. And then he, or, or and food and then he went on upstairs. And this was what happened. So I remember that. I don\u2019t remember what\u2019s in these photographs you know of the dancing and all of those, don\u2019t remember that at all."

They were, there was a staging area in one of the suburbs of Warsaw. And I have the name upstairs, be able to find it. From which people were shipped out to the concentration camps on the trains. And the nuns were about to be shipped out. And one of the Germans on the platform said to the Mother Superior that the, one of the commandments was a Catholic and she should go and talk to him and see if he could help her. And my mother describes literally how they, her foot on the bottom rung of the train car when the Mother Superior came running down the station waving this little slip of paper saying that they could go. So I had 13 nuns show up on the doorstep of the place where I was out in the country. And I had apparently the sense not to, I recognized my mother but I had the sense not to say anything about the fact that she was call her my mother or anything like that."

The very first African American I ever saw was Paul Robeson who came to give a concert and marched in the May Day parade. Of course, I didn\u2019t know particularly \u2014 I, we went to the concert actually and I heard him sing. But you know in retrospect that seems sort of amazing now. At the time it was, it was not, 1t was not that. And my parents knew people you know in Sweden from before the war and they were a few of their friends who went to Sweden after the war. They will be mostly women, mostly older women and they, most of them lived in these little pensions. Their families were gone. And this aunt who survived was living in one of them.

And the one proviso was that at the death of the person we were to allow an autopsy of the brain. The doctor called me who did the autopsy afterward and he said was my father a boxer. And I said no. And he said well he has brain damage of the type which only a boxer or somebody who had been hit in the head a lot would have. And that\u2019s probably what caused the Alzheimer\u2019s. Now my father never mentioned anything. It could only have happened during the war. But he had never talked about it. Ever. And you know whenever I would ask https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Susanne K.

But Eustache Radziwill whose married Jackie Kennedy\u2019s sister, her, his father the old prince had been a client of my father\u2019s before the war. And the prince survived the war. His wife Anna did not. She died in a German prison, while they were imprisoned. But the prince survived. His daughter and son both did and Eustache Radziwill then introduced my parents to I think he was the one who introduced them to the Kennedys. And for years both Jack and Bobby would buy their little Christmas gifts, mostly little tiny antiquities on little bases from my parents. When they came to New York, they always stayed at the Carlyle which was across the street. And every single time the Carlyle would hop over to my father and borrow some things from his gallery for Jack Kennedy\u2019s suite. Things with a marine theme, so there was a little ship which I have still and some other things to sort of decorate it while he was there. And then back it would come and my father would take it home because he was thrilled to be able to do this for Kennedy who he thought was wonderful. And he didn\u2019t want to sell the things that he, you know he kept them. My mother especially liked Bobby Kennedy who actually liked her a lot and would bring her gifts from his trips which was kind of fun. It was sort of amazing you know.

Bennet o/ was very interesting to me at that time was she also read about Emmet Till and she was flabbergasted that that had happened so recently. She wasn\u2019t aware of how recently the whole civil war battle had been fought and I told her that my senior year in high school we had come down here with my international relations club, my teacher, for a visit to Washington. We actually met with Nixon believe it or not who was then up on the Hill. And when we showed up at our hotel, we were turned away because we had two Puerto Rican girls in our group. This was in 1955. And my daughter could not believe it. You know she just was that it was that recently. And so we just marched down to the local Y and stayed there. And the whole group of us. It was a lesson for us because we had never at Hunter been the least bit aware of anybody being different. And just had never thought about it. Just as at Wellesley. I mean since then I\u2019ve found that a lot of the Catholic girls stuck together which I was not aware of particularly at the time. But we never really talked religion either. In college, in those days in the 50s. We talked politics and we got into battles about politics. I mean John Kennedy was running for president at the end there and he came to Wellesley and spoke and so forth. And one of the people in my class was Eisenhower\u2019s Secretary of Defense\u2019s daughter. For example. And was a rabid Republican. So we talked about things like that. We talked about our majors.

It\u2019s just not a big part of, religion is not, I mean for one thing they went to the Cathedral school. And I think that sort of turned them more against religion than anything else did.

I feel very apprehensive about what\u2019s https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Susanne K. Bennet 64 going to happen to Israel. I feel that they have made some very serious mistakes in how they treat the Palestinians. And what I saw when I was there was pretty god awful and it simply made me think that they were doing the same thing that the Germans had done with the Jews in making them non-people. You know at one point, at one of the check points which were really set up massively during the Intifada, I saw some soldiers being absolutely horrible to a couple of old Palestinian men. And that brought back memories. And they have you know totally ghettoized them. I think in the end if Israel wants to continue to be there they have to develop a relationship and a decent relationship with the Palestinians. And you know even realizing that the Arabs have deliberately kept the Palestinians living in the situation which they are as a provocation to Israel, even realizing all of these things, I think that Israel has become very, very conservative in recent years. I was amazed to find when I was there, I\u2019m trying to remember what year it was that James was there. The majority of Israelis at that point were either middle east, I mean born in Arab countries or from Russia. So they had grown up in countries where in countries where in the Middle East where religion and government were completely intertwined. Which was not a good thing for Israel. They were trying to have the same thing happen in Israel. And I knew I mean when I was growing up in New York Teddy Kollek would come and visit my parents. Moshe Dayan would come and visit and so forth, and they were secular people. And they understood. You know they were Jewish but they understood the need for secular government and not to have religion be the one that ran the government. And I think this is an enormous danger now in Israel. I mean you have people who are so unaware of their own history I think in many ways. And treating people the way they are treating the Palestinians who are of course an enormous danger to them. Only makes it more dangerous. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Susanne K. Bennet 65"
