But that was the center of a lot of activities up there. And so we were taken down to \u2014 to northern Illinois, where they had a \u2014 a center for processing the \u2014 the troops and so forth, where we got all of our shots, and all of our \u2014 all of our warnings, an-and \u2014 and early \u2014 early instruction. The fact I\u2019d been in National Guard though, made me kind of special, because I then was put in charge of small delegations that started training. From there we were shipped, after the initial equipping and issuing of clothing and blankets, and so forth, I was shipped to Jefferson barracks Missouri, which 1s adjacent to Saint Louis, Missouri. And Jefferson barracks was \u2014 it was cold, and middle of the \u2014 middle of the winter, virtually. And down there we were placed in tents, and very, very cold. There we got all of our real tough shots. And the shots made us so sick that we were afraid we wouldn\u2019t die. There, while I was at Jefferson barracks, and that \u2014 we started our training there, I\u2019d \u2014 I did the drill sergeant role of taking the raw recruits and showing them how to march and how to turn and how to stop and the proper commands and all that. But then the newspaper headlines come out; Roosevelt, we will be building 125,000 planes a year. It was Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Ernest Dutcher \" February 19, 2013 beyond belief, but anyway, it didn\u2019t make that much sense because during the time that I had gone through medical \u2014 the medical exams, I got what is commonly known as white coat fever.

But that\u2019s some of the things I remember, and \u2014 and then we went through a very, very grueling course on radio \u2014 radar. And radar was so new that information was coming from a mass \u2014 the MIT labs, where they invented s-some of the aspects, including the \u2014 a very powerful tube that could generate enormously strong pulses.

Anyway, there again, after m \u2014 drawing the design kind of roughly, I decided before I waste any more time that I would go back to Washington, and meet with the \u2014 the FAA, and so they set up an appointment a half an hour. And we got \u2014 my \u2014 my brother then met me at that point, and \u2014 cause he was a pilot that had not finished his training Interview with Ernest Dutcher \"\u00b0 February 19, 2013 before he was sent overseas.

And the half hour meeting turned into four hours, the whole afternoon was taken, and at the end they says, look, we know \u2014 we\u2019re pretty sure that this will probably save 95 percent of our collisions, he says, but unless you get to a hundred percent, there\u2019s no way we can ever get it through Congress, or get it approved. So \u2014 and I \u2014 and I also met with people at M- Magnavox Corporation, a big electronics firm. They al-also designed a system. So I had communications with them, and they had the same \u2014 same luck. Eventually I \u2014 I made a ri \u2014a di\u2014a revelation \u2014 or I made a disclosure to Bendix Aircraft, and I says, here I\u2019m disclosing this, what can you do with it?

And part of the admiration was, we were trying to tell ourselves, why would they go through \u2014 why would they go through that torture and everything without committing suicide? We couldn\u2019t figure that out. Well, the answer came in the fact that their \u2014 their great faith and their great will, and \u2014 and that\u2019s \u2014 kind of answers the question, so \u2014 but the younger generation \u2014 I \u2014 I was \u2014 my grandson I mentioned took me to a -- what they call a \u2014 a bring and tell to a f\u2014 a first grade class. And he brought me in, the other kids brought toys and different things like that, he brought me in. And he says, this is my grandpa and he wants to tell you something about the war.

I told them, and I had to be careful cause there was Japanese 103 Interview with Ernest Dutcher February 19, 2013 teachers there, so I had to be careful not to mention how bad they were. But I only mentioned this bad man out of Germany. And he took all those people and \u2014 and he put them in camps, and he \u2014 they killed them, and this was terrible. But he s \u2014 it \u2014 it was a bad \u2014 it was a bad war. And then at the end, a little Korean first grader came up to me and says, who won the war? I says, well, we did. He says, cool. So, anyway. But yeah, I think the thing I \u2014 should be done na \u2014 thing I should \u2014 thing should be done now, and I\u2019ve offered to do it over the years, is to speak to high school groups and high school history groups, a-as part of their curriculum.
