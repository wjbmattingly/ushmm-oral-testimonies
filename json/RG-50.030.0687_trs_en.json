            "answer": "Well, we enlisted in Wausau , Wisconsin, which is a much, much larger city, it must have had at least 15,000 people in it. About 50 percent larger, I would say. But that was the center of a lot of activities up there. And so we were taken down to \u0152 to northern Illinois, where they had a \u0152 a center for processing the \u0152 the troops and so forth, where we got all of our shots, and all of our \u0152 all of our warnings, an-and \u0152 and early \u0152 early instruction. The fact I\u2122d been in National Guard though, made me kind of special, because I then was put in charge of small delegations that started training. From there we were shipped, after the initial equipping and issuing of clothing and blankets, and so forth, I was shipped to Jefferson barracks Missouri, which is adjacent to Saint Louis, Missouri. And Jefferson barracks was \u0152 it was cold, and middle of the \u0152 middle of the wi nter, virtually. And down there we were placed in tents, and very, very cold. There we got all of our real tough shots. And the shots made us so sick that we were afraid we wouldn\u2122t die. There, while I was at Jefferson barracks, and that \u0152 we started our training there, I\u2122d \u0152 I did the drill sergeant role of taking the raw recruits and showing them how to march and how to turn and how to stop and the proper comma nds and all that. But then the newspaper headlines come out; Roosevelt , we will be building 125,000 planes a year. It was Interview with Ernest Dutcher February 19, 2013 10beyond belief, but anyway, it didn\u2122t make that much sense because during the time that I had gone through medical \u0152 the medical exams, I got what is commonly known as white coat fever. And the \u0152 and \u0152 and I got excited. I was so worried that I wouldn\u2122t pass, that I, of course, didn\u2122t, and my blood pre ssure went sky high during the exams.

Anyway, there again, after m \u0152 drawing the design kind of roughly, I decided before I waste any more time that I would go back to Washington , and meet with the \u0152 the FAA , and so they set up an appointment a half an hour. And we got \u0152 my \u0152 my brother then met me at that point, and \u0152 cause he was a pilot that had not finished his training Interview with Ernest Dutcher February 19, 2013 66before he was sent overseas. And he met me, and we met with the FAA, and I showed the the design, I showed them the \u0152 where \u0152 where I had had success of that in Europe , it had actually worked, and so forth. And the half hour meeting turned into four hours, the whole afternoon was taken, and at the end they says, look, we know \u0152 we\u2122re pretty sure that this will probably save 95 percent of our collisions, he says, but unless you get to a hundred percent, there\u2122s no way we can ever get it through Congress, or get it approved. So \u0152 and I \u0152 and I also met with people at M-Magnavox Corporation, a big electronics firm. They al-also designed a system.

Eventually I \u0152 I made a ri \u0152 a di \u0152 a revelation \u0152 or I made a disclosure to Bendix Aircraft, and I says, here I\u2122m disclosing this, what can yo u do with it?

And part of the admiration was, we were trying to tell ourselves, why would they go through \u0152 why would they go through that torture and everything without committing suicide? We couldn\u2122t figure that out. Well, the answer came in the fact that their \u0152 their great faith and their great will, and \u0152 and that\u2122s \u0152 kind of answers the question, so \u0152 but the younger generation \u0152 I \u0152 I was \u0152 my grandson I mentioned took me to a -- what they call a \u0152 a bring and tell to a f \u0152 a first grade class. And he brought me in, the other kids brought toys and di fferent things like that, he brought me in. And he says, this is my grandpa and he wants to te ll you something about the war.

I told them, and I had to be careful cause there was Japanese Interview with Ernest Dutcher February 19, 2013 103teachers there, so I had to be careful not to mention how bad they were. But I only mentioned this bad man out of Germany . And he took all those people and \u0152 and he put them in camps, and he \u0152 they killed them, and this was terrible. But he s \u0152 it \u0152 it was a bad \u0152 it was a bad war. And then at the end, a little Korean first grader came up to me and says, who won the war? I says, well, we did. He says, cool. So, anyway. But yeah, I think the thing I \u0152 should be done na \u0152 thing I should \u0152 thing should be done now, and I\u2122ve offered to do it over the years, is to speak to high school groups and high school history groups, a-as part of their curriculum.
