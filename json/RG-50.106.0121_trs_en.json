In Leitmeritz, in our barracks specially, were quite few Yugoslavs. And very often, when you got up in the morning, one of the Yugoslav was hanging, suicide. From my experience, the nicest people with whom I was in the camp, were the Yugoslavs. Maybe because of language was similar and maybe of their behavior and maybe because of this experience, that I didn\u2019t come across in concentration camp, of suicides committed by anybody else but Yugoslavs. And I promise myself, this time I thought so, said when \u2014 I will not fall asleep. Only I will be waiting, and if I will see that somebody\u2019s doing, I will follow and I will do the same. A funny story, when I didn\u2019t fall asleep, I was tired the next day and nobody did commit suicide. But when I did fall asleep, somebody did. So what I figure out, probably when I heard the noises that somebody\u2019s trying to commit, being a coward, I fall asleep. I-I\u2019m not joking, but probably that\u2019s how it was."
