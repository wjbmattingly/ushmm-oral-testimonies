So scary, which I told you I never was a hero. I looked my hand and I saw blood, and I passed out. So the Germans woke me up and [indecipherable] and going and they pulled us to a place, to a spot where was a big hole, because the other group of the fighters, different groups, did mar \u2014 put the mine and Germans were killed when they came to this spot. So they were putting guys around and shooting them. And probably if they would have enough, they would put somebody else, but I don\u2019t know. As long as we are waiting for [indecipherable] they pull my watch and they pulled my ring. They didn\u2019t put us, they took us, and this was where I was taken to concentration camp on the train and I was sick, because I had open only wound right here, and continuously bleeding, but what worse was, when stop bleeding, was closing my eye. And this time I found myself on the train with my dear friend who just passed away, Henry Fenigstein from Toronto. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

In Leitmeritz, in our barracks specially, were quite few Yugoslavs. And very often, when you got up in the morning, one of the Yugoslav was hanging, suicide. From my experience, the nicest people with whom I was in the camp, were the Yugoslavs. Maybe because of language was similar and maybe of their behavior and maybe because of this experience, that I didn\u2019t come across in concentration camp, of suicides committed by anybody else but Yugoslavs. And I promise myself, this time I thought so, said when \u2014 I will not fall asleep. Only I will be waiting, and if I will see that somebody\u2019s doing, I will follow and I will do the same. A funny story, when I didn\u2019t fall asleep, I was tired the next day and nobody did commit suicide. But when I did fall asleep, somebody did.

This is Catholic part of Germany. These people hate Hitler and Jews. That\u2019s what he said. So from now on, no one is a Jew. We are Catholics, even when you are Protestants. Then you will get help from these people. And now we cannot go thousands, so let\u2019s make small groups and go. So we made small groups and we decided to go all different ways. Thousand people and only one fellow, who acted very nicely in all the camps, by the name of Markowski(ph), which was a secretary in few camps, it means he was keeping books and everything, and he was very nice. He told me that he is a lawyer from the part of Lvov, Poland. And I remember that in the camp, where we were this time, I needed to say Kaddish after my father. And I went to him and I said to him \u2014 I was very friendly with him, and I said to him that I have a problem. I need to have 10 Jews to say the Kaddish.

Now if you will not ask if somebody is Jew or not, I will call the people and I will say Joseph, it means we are 10 here. And you go to the window and you do whatever you want. And so it was. He decided to take a group of Polacks. Polacks it means not like us Polacks, only Polacks \u2014 Catholics, and I should take a group of 10 Jewish with us, and we will go together. We went together only for two days. After two days we had bloody noses. It started the calling names, and fights. "
