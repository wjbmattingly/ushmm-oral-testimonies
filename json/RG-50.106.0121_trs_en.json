And you would sa y bad, right? No, this was not bad, this was good because I was sent to the camp and in the camp the doctor put the stitches; 12, I think, stitches he put, and the \u0152 I was sent back to the camp \u0152 to the factory.

So this \u0152 that my hand was hit and I got the stitches, was only help me that I was in a clean place. He permitted me even to wash my shirt, and to dry there and then to put again on, and he ti \u0152 taught me how to be a dr aftsman.

In Leitmeritz, in our barracks specially, were quite few Yugoslavs. And very often, when you got up in the morning, one of the Yugoslav was hangi ng, suicide. From my experience, the nicest people with whom I was in the camp, were the Yugoslavs. Maybe because of language wa s similar and maybe of their behavior and maybe because of this experience, that I didn\u2122t come across in concentration camp, of suicides committed by anybody else but Yugoslavs. And I promise myself, this time I thought so, said when \u0152 I will not fall asleep. Only I will be waiting, and if I will see that somebody\u2122s doing, I will follow and I will do the same. A funny story, when I didn\u2122t fall asleep, I was tired the next day and nobody did commit suicide. But when I did fall asleep, somebody did. So what I figure out, probably when I heard the noises that somebody\u2122s tr ying to commit, being a coward, I fall asleep. I-I\u2122m not joking, but probably that\u2122s how it was."

You probably heard about, this was quite the camp too, and the specific camp, because when I was in Dachau the chimneys were not working, it means they were not burning anybody.

He told me that he is a lawyer from the part of Lvov , Poland. And I remember that in the camp, where we were this time, I needed to say Kaddish after my father.

Now if you will not ask if somebody is Jew or not, I will call the people and I will say Joseph , it means we are 10 here. And you go to the window and you do whatever you want. And so it was. He decided to take a group of Polacks. Polacks it means not like us Polacks , only Polacks \u0152 Catholics, and I should take a group of 10 Jewish with us, and we will go together.

And one afternoon we were already tired to sit in the woods, we decided it\u2122s not dark yet, but let\u2122s go, cause no movement.

So we started to run not moving, only run up and down, and I say I am running back to the woods. And the fellow says, I don\u2122t think that we have a chance.
