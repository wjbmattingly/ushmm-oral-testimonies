It was none, but it was excuse for them. So when I left it on the next month, I got another enterprise. It is no with military connection, so we -- we start over from this point. And -- bu -- it was the year 1979, and we believe that because it was like Olympic game in Moscow, maybe they -- they a little bit open the door, and maybe we will be lucky to go through this door. And well, they said no. They said no, no, no, no, no. Some people they managed, I don\u2019t know how they gave under table money to someone, they -- everything was corrupt, so maybe they find the way. But we did not -- we was unable to do it. But what we said, so it was like a legal situation, was you can do like you are on the level, not- not fighting. Cause the government, every six months you can to send documents that you apply -- that you did not change your mind, you still apply. And they send you a postcard they know. Th -- they did -- the -- a division of visas permission, they said you cannot go, no, your -- your request is denied, your request is denied. And it -- as I said, it was when we start -- our problem was that when we start first time to do it, our son was about two year old. No, not two -- yeah, two year old when we start first time there. When he went to the final stage, he almost finish college, and even in this situation, when they play games, a open society, blah, blah, blah, they did unbelievable thing because they played games and said, you know, mom can go, you cannot go. Later they said you can go but your son cannot go. And in this time, the chief -- the chief of this department, he gave interview to some foreign newspapers and he said, \u201cEveryone who want go, we let them go. We don\u2019t keep anyone. There\u2019s no one want to go.\u201d And I came to him, to his office with this newspaper, and I said, \u201cLet me ask you a que,\u201d -- it -- in Moscow his was very, very, very hi -- high level guy, and it\u2019s -- you know, you never know what happen to you when you come back from this -- from this office, because he was very powerful. So I came to him with this newspaper, I said, \u201cMay I ask you a question please? What does it means? This is an interview that you gave to this reporter. He did not understand you right? Or it\u2019s a -- a -- a mistake in newspaper?\u201d And he said to me, \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201che understand me right, but we make a decision, not he.\u201d And he said, \u201cYour son, we cannot let your son go.\u201d And it was a sp-specific system in -- in Russia that everyone -- every man, he has a gi -- duty to serve three years in the military. After military it\u2019s -- besides there\u2019s a -- the life in the military, it\u2019s more than in prison. But after military they said to you, you cannot go because you know secrets, you was in military. And no one knows what kind of secrets and how long it lasts to keep you because you was in military. And my son said to me, \u201cListen, I better die than I go to this military.\u201d And with these words, with understanding this, we have to go to this guy a few times, it was very, very difficult. And finally, as I said, when we were -- when the wind was a little bit warmer, and they let him go, and later we left, and in Italy, when he came to Italy, he decided he would like to help young Jewish kids to go to Judaism. So he got a [indecipherable] like this, he listened to -- they got like -- a rabbi came to Italy, and they tried to introduce to the culture, to the tradition the ju -- Judaism. And everyone was on the beach because it was months, we are not working, you got food, and they make a decision when -- when sk -- they scheduled to bring you to United States, and he was busy with kids, wi -- wi -- because he said that this 1s what he has to do. And when we came here, so very soon he said that we don\u2019t -- we -- we not the right life -- the right life, this is a philosophy. And he changed his life, he become religion.
