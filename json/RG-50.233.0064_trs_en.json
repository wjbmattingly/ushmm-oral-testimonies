    "header": "A: Yes. That was my mother\u2122s father. And neither do I remember my father\u2122s father, who had apparently had died before I was born. I do remember my father\u2122s mother and I do remember my mo ther\u2122s mother. My father\u2122s mother lived near us but we never spent as much time with her as we spent with my mother\u2122s mother. I don\u2122t know why that is but I suppose that is sort of par for the course, it happens everywhere. And uh .. my mother\u2122s mother really did go along on all vacations with us -- and sort of -- while she did not live with us -- she lived in her own place -- we saw her much more frequently. Every Friday night we went to her house for Friday night dinner which for some traditional reason was not chicken but rather was roast beef -- or whatever -- roast beef and roast potatoes or something like that. I am not quite sure. Oh, I would like to talk briefly about my first memories of the Hitler rise to power and socialism and what I overheard in our house. -- Um .. the first, the first real memory that I have of a discussing about Hitler was -- or about National Socialists -- was one night when we were visiting my uncle -- this was my mother\u2122s brother -- who also lived in Berlin -- who also had been born in Berlin -- but by the way, they did not live too far away from where the Reichstag was. We saw the sky turning red and over the radio we heard that there was a fire in the Reichstag and at the time, I remember a conversation that my parents had with my uncle about that particular event and about how they thought that it probably was a staged event and so on and so forth. My father was fairly conservative, fairly nationalistic German. I think now that if there is a political equivalent in this country now you would probably say that he was very much a conservative republican a nd he felt that this \u2013 first of all, I think \u2013 basically I suspect, that while he never said so, he probably felt some sympathy for some of the things that Hitle r stood for. Not of course with the persecution of the Jews but with national pride which my father I believe shared and he always \u2013 I remember one of the th ings that he always used to say was, \ufb01Well, this is an aberration and this man will mellow and change his mind about the Jews, particularly the Jews that had served Germany in the war and so on and so forth, or else he will be replaced with someone from his party that doesn\u2122t believe in all that nonsense and if it do esn\u2122t work out, we will leave on the \ufb01last train\ufb02.\ufb02 Whatever that \ufb01last train\ufb02 meant, we never caught it. We didn\u2122t make that last train. I am trying to think back now, I am trying to be a little bit \u2013 go more a little bit in time. Probabl y about \u212235 or \u212236, things started changing in Germany and Jewish children could no longer attend the regular public schools and I had to go to what was a Jewish school and that school was in the backyard of a synagogue in a fairly old building in the ol der part of town. And it was necessary for me to either take a subway ---- to take an elevator train, or walk. And, I still remember some of my teachers and uh -- that was not .. I think the school was very good. Uh .. I think I missed some of my friends from the public school but I got used to it very quickly and that\u2122s when I started, in addition to having regular schooling, I started to have religious instruction also. Peculiarly enough, even so that we belonged then to a reformed synagogue, the religious instruction that I received was Conservative Judaism -- th e reform synagogue did not have any religious school. Uh .. I went to that school for a couple of years and then, you know, I was probably seven, eight years, nine years old and while one is not \u2013 really does not .. is not too politically cognizant of what is going on. I did hear a lot of conversation about Jewish doctors being no longer allowed to treat non-Jewish patients, Jewish attorneys no longer being allowed to practice cases, other restrictions. Also, my father complaining that some of his gentile customers no longer would buy from him or were afraid to buy from him and uh \u2013 there was a general deterioration in the quality of life \u2013 not the quality of life so much but the economic aspects of life. As far as I can recall, the quality of our life really continued pretty much as it had before . We continued to take our summer vacations, we continued to go to our summer house in Neunehagen, my parents continued to go to concerts and to the opera and when I reached this age, they took me once in a while and all those things were opened up to us and we continued to have a \u2013 I believe an automobile and I believe there came a time when we could no longer drive the automobile because Jews could no longer drive pleasure vehicles, and my father ha d to sell it and was pretty disgruntled about that. But meanwhile, he kept sayi ng, \ufb01Well this will go away and this will blow over and this is just temporary\ufb02 a nd his business was still fairly good so he wasn\u2122t complaining. So things pretty much continued. ",

            "question": "Did he take over that business? Was it pretty much \u2013",
            "answer": "Yes, he was really running the business. Since my grandfather died, he was really running the business. He was doing it. Maybe this was really \u2013 for all I know, he might have gone in the business because my grandfather was sick or was dying or something like that \u2013 that there woul d be continuity for the business -- that might have very well been the reason. Um \u2013 when I left grammar school, which was probably around 1937 or 1938, I don\u2122t reme mber exactly anymore, we had to go to a different school -- what was known as an upper school -- a Gymnasium kind of thing -- but it was not called a Gymnasium because there were not supposed to be Jewish Gymnasium. It was called Jude Schule Nacht Liebplan und UberSchule -- UberSchule meaning an upper school kind of a thing. And that was in the Western part of the city. And I really believe that this is when I had my first, first personal contact wi th prejudice because for some reason or other, there were a lot of young kids, non-Jewish young kids who would wait for us in order to harass us and beat us up on the way to school and there was just really almost no escaping it and every day it was a challe nge to try and devise a way to go to school a little different -- different street, different side of the street or get off at a different elevator stop -- to try to avoid that. And very often we were successful, very often we were not. Most of the time, I had to go alone because where I lived there was no other kid that was going to that school and it became a daily challenge and I really reme mber being afraid every day to go to school and crying to my mother that I don\u2122t want to go and I\u2122m afraid and this and that and the other thing and my parents said you have to go, you have to go to school. I really don\u2122t know why my parent s didn\u2122t accompany me to school but I suppose you can\u2122t do that every day anyways. But somehow, I made school every day. I mean, nobody really got hurt serious ly, we would just get knocked around a little bit -- but I was afraid of it. I was never really strong or a very athletic child. In fact my parents tried to encourage th at aspect in me and had me join the Maccabean soccer league and I had boxing le ssons and stuff like that which I was never really good at. I was just as bad at my piano lessons, I was never any good at that either. In any event, that became a problem. Then came the Kristallnacht on November 9, 1938, and at that time, my father\u2122s business was all smeared up on the outside with \ufb01Jewish Store\ufb02 kind of a thing. Even so, it wasn\u2122t really a store -- it was a wholesale business -- people couldn\u2122t really go in and buy. It was painted with big letters and people were standing outside and discouraging customers from going in. Many of the synagogues were burned down -- in fact, most of them. And that was a turning point in the general prosecution er .. persecution of the Jews. It really, from then on, everybody\u2122s life sort of became miserable who was still left."

And uh \u2013 my whole life started to change after November 9 th. First of all, that summer -- my mother -- we had been on vacation, I believe in the Hartz Mountains which are mountains in lo wer Saxony and my mother became ill, while we were on vacation and she had to be brought back in an ambulance.

I th ink that a lot of it had to do with -- probably a lot of it had to do with my mother\u2122s dying -- it had to do with the deterioration of the business -- the general hopelessness if the situation and he still kept saying \ufb01This won\u2122t last -- this won\u2122t last.\ufb02 But then he started, I believe, trying to get us out of the country. But after 1939, it was really quite difficult -- the European countries like France and Britain would not take uh .. Jewish refugees at that time. For th e United States, you had to have a relative who guaranteed your financial support. We knew nobody here so that was impossible. My father made some tent ative tries to get to a South American country and I will tell you more about that later. I think he made some contacts in Chile and I think some work was done along those lines, hoping to get to Chile."

That was a problem too, I believe that s ooner or later, we weren\u2122t allowed any more to have a non-Jewish servant living in the household so I think she became a day person who would come in. My fath er became ill and died on December 19, 1940 of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis was the n, still a very dread disease. Today of course, it has been eradicated -- or maybe it\u2122s coming to the fore again -- I don\u2122t know.

Of course, you couldn\u2122t go to the regular hospital, you had to go to the Jewish hospital -- he went to the Jewish hospital in Berlin and died in that hospital. Af ter my father had died, my grandmother liquidated their apartment and I moved in w ith her. That\u2122s my mother\u2122s mother. My father\u2122s mother had died in between somewhere -- somewhere along the line - probably I would say 1935 or 1936, somewher e along that line. But as I said earlier, we weren\u2122t really that close to her. So from 1940, after December 1940, I moved in with my grandmother and move d in with her. I remember my Bar Mitzvah -- which was a very small affair -- but I did have a Bar Mitzvah -- and I guess because of my grandmother, it wa s in an orthodox synagogue. But it was a very small thing in our apartment afterw ards with some people coming over. Nobody could have big festivit ies any more -- you couldn\u2122 t go to restaurants any more and you couldn\u2122t go to concerts any more. My grandmother wasn\u2122t involved in that kind of thing anyhow -- all that stuff after my mother died. Uh .. I continued with my schooling while I liv e with my grandmother and we received a notice in January 1942 to report for resettlement on let\u2122s say on about the 20 th of that month. I can\u2122t be sure of the correct date, but around the 20th or 21st of January 1942. We reported to a very la rge -- one of the few synagogues that had been left standing."

I remember my grandmother had me put on double clothing -- two pairs of pants and two shirts and things like that and she took a hundred mark note and wrapped it up -- wrapped a yarn around it so it would look like some extra sewing material and gave me that to keep in my pocket which turned out to make no sense at all but you know, those are things that people do when they don\u2122t know where they are going."

It turns out la ter on that we lost everything anyway so it doesn\u2122t make a difference -- the whole thing was academic. Um \u2013 my last memories of Berlin uh .. were that, as we were leaving the synagogue, my \u2013 the principal of my \u2013 of the high school that I had gone to was standing at the exit point and gave each person a hard candy and he said goodbye to me and I was surprised that he remembered me and then we were put on a truck -- an open truck and the last sight that I remember of Ber lin is that victory column th at site in the middle of the Tiergarten, it\u2122s just a monument -- nothi ng really special -- I believe it remembers -- it commemorates a victory in the wa r of 1870-71 against the French. Um \u2013 we were brought to a railroad yard and uh \u2013 in freight cars -- you know, in regular freight cars \u2013 and they were lock ed and we started our journey. Many of the people, I remember, were fairly old -- I was the only child in that particular car -- the only youngster. I must have been about fourteen -- about thirteen and a half years old. It was soon after my Bar Mitzvah. My Bar Mitzvah had been in May 1941 -- June 1941, so this must have been like since months after my Bar Mitzvah. And uh .. there were pails for toilet needs which were emptied from time to time -- the journey took, I believe, about seven or eight days. It was getting colder, the food was relatively inadequate -- this was in the middle of winter -- this was in January and we were headed East so obviously freight cars have no heating facilities -- but there were enough of us in the car so there was a certain amount of human warmth."

Q For your mother and father when they pa ssed away, was it still possible to have a normal funeral service? A Yes, it was. There was a normal .. you know there is a Jewish cemetery in Berlin and one of the peculiarities of the German Jewish community was there was one very large cemetery which catered to all the different religious -- religious Jewish denominations so it is a very gigantic pl ace -- it\u2122s still in existence -- I have been back there two or three times and it is a very lovely, peaceful place.

So let me go into the first two weeks of it so that I can tell you best as to what I recall best about it. As I said, I was with my grandmother who was in those days, probably in her early sixties and uh \u2013 if I remember correctly, fairly old looking. It really fits the image -- she had gray hair and she was a little lady, maybe a li ttle on the heavy side, not too \u2013 but maybe a little on the heavy side. We were together in a kitchen with two other people, with a single woman and a single man. I don\u2122t remember exactly how we slept -- all I remember is that nobody really had any pur pose. I mean, everything was aimless, we just would -- I would -- you know being a thirteen and a half year old kid, I was kind of curious and I would walk around and scavenge around and look for things and try to get into building that were not -- that were not occupied which of course you weren\u2122t supposed to do, but I really hadn\u2122t quite gotten used to the idea of imprisonment yet. Uh .. I would say that about the fourth or fifth day that we were there, when we went out to get our meal, they asked us for volunteers to help to sort clothes ad I said to my grandmother, \ufb01I th ink I\u2122d like to go\ufb02 and she said, no, don\u2122t go and I said \ufb01yeah, I want to do this. I have nothing to do.\ufb02 So I did, and I remember that they brought us into a big hall and we had to sort. Apparently those were the clothes of the Latvian Jews which we of course didn\u2122t know. And we had to put sweaters with sweaters and pants with pants -- stuff like that.

And you know, when I made my way back, to this kitchen where we were living but my grandmother wasn\u2122t there and uh \u2013 I asked for her but nobody knew where she was. And then it turned out that a number of the older people had been taken away. And apparently the first, I know now \u2013 but as far as I was concerned, she had just disappeared. But we know now that the Germans in Latvia first experimented with those trucks whereby they would direct the exhaust into the truck and uh .. while they were driving the people would suffocate and then they would just unload them and \u2013 you know, go for the next load. Of course, later on, that turned out to be a very tedious and slow process and they couldn\u2122t handle very many people. They could only take lik e twenty or thirty people in each truck and there wasn\u2122t really an efficient way for the Germans to do the job so they subsequently abandoned that method and us ed the shower rooms and what have you. So uh .. the first few days without my grandmother were really an extremely difficult time for me because I had always been a sheltered kid, had always been with adults, had always been with my family and uh .. it was really very traumatic -- to be all of a sudden by yourself and to \u2013 it was a mixture of feeling lonely and feeling afraid and feeling scared and uh .. I wasn\u2122t really as much worried about my life as I was just at a loss about what happens now? Where do I go? Who is going to take care of me?

I reme mber sleeping on the floor while they shared a bed. They turned out .. they became lovers later on which amazingly enough that people would think about those kind of things in the ghetto but I guess, love is a pretty powerful influence, it comes right after food."

You hide from those that you feel can hurt you, you are anxious not to share anything that you have with those that are with you. There are stories now about many friendships having formed in the ghettos and in the concentration camps. I have never experienced that and as far as I am con cerned, I was very selfish and very self-contained. I was never able to get an advantage in any way whereby I could work a little less or get a little extra food, I was very anxious to preserve that for myself and not tell anybody else about it and so, if anything, that mentality was probably one of the ugliest aspects of our im prisonment because we became totally oblivious to those around us -- sometimes to the extent that if you saw somebody who was being kicked or beaten or abused or killed or hanged -- one of the feelings that would come to your mind fi rst was boy, am I glad it\u2122s not me. And rather than feeling sorry for the first that this was being done to, and I think this was one of the, one of the dehumanizing and ugliest aspects of the whole \u2013 of that whole situation.

There were very few S. S. men or guards in the ghetto -- I mean we were just sort of like in a steam cooker -- we were left to cook by ourselves. There were obviously people -- guards at the gates uh \u2013 I don\u2122t remember any specific acts of cruelty or harassment in the ghetto. There were at work, if we didn\u2122t work fast enough, they would kick us or prod us with a shovel or rifle or something like that but it really wasn\u2122t the real gruesome things that you hear about --those really all came later and in the various concentration camps. Uh \u2013 I am going to try to put this in a proper time frame now. I stayed in the ghetto probably from the beginning of Februa ry 1942 until uh \u2013 late in 1943 or maybe even the beginning of \u212244 and uh .. no, no, it wasn\u2122t that long -- excuse me, I\u2122m sorry. It was from the beginning of \u2122 42 until probably early \u212243. Then the Germans were beginning to liquidate th e ghettos and were moving people into labor camps and concentration camps. Uh .. I would say it was somewhere in \u212243, early \u212243, maybe middle of \u212243. It seems to me that it was either spring or summer, that the spring and summer in Ru ssia are very short and don\u2122t last long. Uh \u2013 we were brought from the ghe tto to a concentration camp called Kaiserwald, and from there, where we rea lly stayed a relatively short time, and then were brought to a factory in Riga that specialized in receiving, sorting, cleaning and rehabilitating uniforms for th e German army from the front -- it was called ABA 701 -- ABA standing for Armee Bekleidung Amt ( Mr. Lachman spells these words out ) Amt being bureau. And there we had much more contact with the guards and there was a great deal more harassment and a great deal more supervision and of course that was beginning to be real concentration camp like where instead of, this was a big old fact ory building -- it was a factory that had manufactured blue color, blue dye and everything in that place was still blue -- I remember that like it was yesterday -- it was called Riga Ultramarine, they had made artificial, I guess, artificial blue color."

But there we were constantly supervised by the S.S. people and constantly harassed and constantly kicked and constantly you know \u2013 annoyed. And uh \u2013 we slept in the typical concentration camp arrangement where there were like \u2013 they weren\u2122t beds \u2013 they were like big platforms, one on top of the other, three high or four high. Everybody would lie in the \u2013 on the platform and it was so crowded that you know, you couldn\u2122t really turn. You had to lie on your side and of course, men were separated from wo men in that situation. There were communal baths and it was really like a concentration camp arrangement. Incidentally, let me go back to the ghetto for a minute. Uh .. from time to time, people would try to escape from the ghetto and as they were caught they would be brought back and hanged and everybody would have to march by in the morning and they would generally leave hanging there for, especially in the winter time when everything froze, sometimes four or six weeks just sort of as a memento so that everybody could see it every day and I guess that was supposed to discourage us from running away. I must tell you th at I really never had any thoughts about running away or anything like that because I couldn\u2122t envision myself \u2013 I had a difficult time enough getting along -- I had no contacts. I didn\u2122t speak Latvian -- I only spoke German. I mean there was ju st no way. Also our hair was cropped close and through the middle we had a shav en strip that was re-shaven probably every two or three weeks so \u2013 and the women were completely shaven. Their heads were completely shaven so you would stand out from the population. I don\u2122t know how people \u2013 I guess some pe ople did get away -- you know, not many but I guess some people did. I mean there are many recorded instances known of people who actually ran away from .. especially from ghettos and joining partisans or undergrounds or what have you. I don\u2122t know that there was much of an underground in Latvia because the Latvians really, from everything we could see, were really very much pr o German and very much anti Russian and I think the Latvians were probably roo ting for the Germans to win and uh .. I would say that the Latvians were basically more -- more the Latvians than the Lithuanians-- were probably more, more an tagonistic towards us than many of the Germans were so I couldn\u2122t envision escapi ng into that element.

But as long as we could work and I guess we were a pretty good working group, they would keep us going. We were concerned because especially the ones that were older than I could see that the tide of the war was turning against the Germans and uh .. they were -- they would say, well, gee, what are they going to do with us if they have to get out of here. ---I would like to take a minute or two and talk about some of the older people who were in the camp because, you know, I had uh .. I was young. I was 14 or 15, 16, whatever age I was at that time, I never had the opportuni ty to acquire any personal dignity if you know what that means -- in other words, I never had a real position in life where I had self respect, where people looked up to me, where people felt this is a great guy or what have you. So, probably on the whole, the whole ghetto and concentration life was easier for me than for some of these people. I remember one of the people that worked with us in that ABA 701, had been the chief gynecologist in one of the leading hospitals in Berlin. Now you know, I can just imagine what scrounging for food -- th e loss of dignity, being kicked around, being cursed at -- I sort of took that in stride. I had grown up with it. I had been cursed at on the way to school so you kind of become accustomed to it -- you don\u2122t like it -- but you figure out that\u2122s the way life is. But I wonder how life was for those people and it must have been mu ch more difficult than it was for me and uh .. well, I didn\u2122t have any particular empathy for him at that time. Now I can think back, I feel that that must have been a degradation to him a great deal worse than it was for me. Uh .. O.K. -- so much about that. So, let\u2122s get back to the end of the German occupation of Riga. By that time, as I said, the Russians were raiding us almost every night -- by raiding \ufb01us\ufb02 -- raiding the Germans. And of course the Russians didn\u2122t know we were there. In fact, towards the end, the Germans were parking trains -- there wa s a train track right through that ABA 701 -- that old factory that we were at, and th e Germans were parking trains that were loaded with ammunition right along side us, so we didn\u2122t care -- it didn\u2122t make any difference but they obviously did that on purpose. Uh .. for one reason or another, the Germans decided to keep us instead of shooting us which was really, really was amazing because in retrospect, I know many people were not as fortunate. The Germans withdrew all th eir forces in Latvia to a uh .. to a bridgehead in Libau -- German name, the Latvian name that it goes by now is Liepaja. It is a port that is not on the Gulf of Riga but is on the Baltic Sea. It is also in Latvia. It is really not far from Riga. And they brought us there and that was a smaller group. They took some of th e people that had worked on that ABA 701 and brought them back to Kaiserwald or Stuthoff near Danzig which is also a large concentration camp. And they t ook probably 80 of us. And again, I don\u2122t know why .. how I was selected to be part of it -- I wasn\u2122t a better worker than anybody else -- I wasn\u2122t a particularly strong or healthy individual -- I was probably as emaciated as everybody else. I think a lot of it was God\u2122s providence and luck. So I was amongst these eighty people that were brought to that place Libau or Liepaja and we were housed in I guess it had been an old mansion -- it was near the ocean, on a beautiful street -- but there was barbed wire around it. We were loading and unloading ships -- mo stly at that point, we were not unloading anything more -- we were loadi ng. The Germans were trying to carry back everything that they could carry back. I remember, we were dismantling even the tin roofs -- putting the sheets of tin in wooden enclosures and they were being shipped back to Germany. They were just stripping the place and we were there for \u2013 that must have been late \u2122 44, that must have been, I would say, early Fall to late Fall \u212244, and we were there for several months doing that particular thing. One of the unfortunate things that happened there was that one of the Russian bombs hit the building that we were in and probably fifteen or so of us were killed. Uh .. which was really too bad. Uh .. again, you don\u2122t feel -- I did not feel, particularly sorry for them, I fe lt particularly glad that it wasn\u2122t me. And, that is one thing that I won\u2122t forgive the Germans for -- is that dehumanization of people -- of this comple te destruction of the human spirit and of the human compassion and you know, that was awful. It was hard to come back and maybe you didn\u2122t come back a ll the way. I don\u2122t know, I\u2122m not sure. Maybe, I will never be as compassionate of a person as you, I have no idea. But in any event, we were there for a while and again, those of us \u2013 the older people tend to be more concerned with the future -- the people of my age really were worried with day to day. \ufb01How am I goi ng to have food today? How can I work the least today? How can I get the best night\u2122s sleep? How can I \u2013?\ufb02 That was about it. \ufb01How can I keep my behind clear so that nobody kicks me around?\ufb02 That kind of thing. And again, people were worried about what will they do with us when this is over with. And again, it was perhaps divine providence or perhaps luck or whatever, they decided to take us back to Germany. As they were evacuating the bridgehead in Libau, they put us on a .. a .. in the hold of a ship full of freight, by that time we were down to about fifty or sixty people, and brought us back to Germany."

I think probably they didn\u2122t want to leave us or didn\u2122t want to leave our bodies for the Russians to find. I think really that was probably th e rationale because I can\u2122t think of any other reason why they would take us bac k, because by that time, they didn\u2122t need us anymore. By that time, they had no more use for our labor because that was early \u212245 and you know .. the thing had comp letely disintegrated. It was either December \u212244 or January \u212245, I don\u2122t know which but it was probably December \u212244, by that time, Germany was in such disa rray that there was no work to be done anymore. As I said, the last time .. wh ile we were in Libau towards the end, we were dismantling buildings and shipping them back which was really one of those nonsense jobs kind of a thing. There was no reason for it. What were they going to do with sheets of metal? You know, there was no need for it any more. Uh \u2013 I remember the ship coming in \u2013 of course we were in the hold, we couldn\u2122t see anything and uh ... when they let us off the ship in Hamburg, I remember terrible devastation in the harbor in Hamburg. It really looked .. we were amazed, I mean we hadn\u2122t been back to Germany \u2013 this was Germany that was so destroyed. Uh \u2013 and, I really think they didn\u2122t know what to do with us when they got us back. It was the kind of thing where somebody says, \ufb01what did you bring us here, where did you get these guys? What am I supposed to do with them?\ufb02 That kind of thing. You know. So uh .. for want of a place, they brought us to a jail -- a city jail, in Hamburg and they put all of us in two cells. Which was awful crowded and uh .. we had just nothing to do for probably .. they kept us there for I would say three or four weeks. We got very in adequate food, they did take us out a few times and the only thing we did when they took us out -- we were collecting shell fragments from the anti-aircraft guns that had fallen -- you know they were really jagged fragments. I don\u2122t know if you have ev er seen an anti-aircraft shell -- they are jagged pieces of metal. You have to be careful when you pick them up because they are really sharp in some instances and we put them on, in Europe they use these trailer trucks that are open trailers in the back but we no longer had trucks because they didn\u2122t have any gasoline so we had to pull the trailers. But again .. this was a nonsense job -- it was really not a job that meant anything because nothing was going anywhere -- nothing was functioning anymore. You know .. Germany for all practical purpos es, really had stopped functioning in those days. Uh .. I suppose, somewhere in the middle or towards the end of January, uh .. maybe the director of the pr ison wanted to get rid of us and said \ufb01 look, take these guys away, I don\u2122t want them here\ufb02 or somebody said, \ufb01What do we do with these people?\ufb02 So, they put us in two small trucks and took us to Bergen-Belsen which is not far from Hamburg."

My old concentration camp number -- which incidentally I was never tattooed, I don\u2122t know why, maybe they weren\u2122t doing it that day that I got my number or something but the old number had been 12360 and I was then given the number 15713.

It was just like a .. you were left to your own devices. We got some food but we got very little water uh .. I remember there were these pools in the camp which were supposed to be water pools that were used .. that were supposed to be used if there was a fire uh .. they were supposed to pump water out of those pools with a fire truck and we would drink that water. Later on, we found dead bodies in those pools -- there was \u2013 you know -- it was just a nightmare and people were sick. I contra cted typhus -- I had terrible diarrhea, I mean just every day, you would drag yourse lf outside of the barrack and sit out there all day long, leaning up against something and when it got dark, you drag yourself back in. There was no more roll call. You know, during the concentration camp -- every morning there wa s roll call and all that kind of stuff. People would come to make sure that nobody escaped. I mean order, total order had broken down, it was just a question of .. the only question that was in our minds, \u201aHow can we survive this? How can we keep this up? How can we stay well enough until this is over?\ufb02 And you know, every day, hundreds of people were dying -- dozens of people. We would try to at least, we couldn\u2122t bury them - we weren\u2122t strong enough for that -- we would drag them towards a place where they would all be together. I mean ther e was no brutality by guards -- there were no guards -- there was nobody there. They just put you in a room and locked the doors and they would once in a while give us some food -- some watery soup that was sort of shoved through the gate and anybody that was strong enough to get to the gate could get some but a lot of peopl e couldn\u2122t even get up and um .. would just die where they lay.

On the day that I now know was April 15, 1945, we saw tanks with stars on them coming through the barbed wire a nd uh .. that was the British army and uh .. the German guards were either -- th e ones that hadn\u2122t me lted away, I imagine a lot of them had run away -- were take n prisoner and the British came in and I guess they were pretty horrified by what they saw because they just couldn\u2122t cope with it. You know, this was an advancing army, they don\u2122t -- how could they have medical facilities for uh .. I believ e the records indicate that there were 13,000 unburied dead were found in the camp -- 23,000 unburied dead were found in the camp -- 13,000 were to die fr om the time that the British took over until they were finally able to bring sa nitation and what have you into the camp. Uh .. the British couldn\u2122t really do anything for us for the first couple of weeks -- they did bring us food but it was rich food that we really couldn\u2122t eat -- but at least we got water. There was no medi cal attention because how could you have enough doctors to take care of all these people. And again, it was probably fate or divine providence that I got better. And a number of us got better. We were then \u2013 the British decided to burn .. oh, the British used the German guard to bury all the unburied dead. We saw that and it was so rt of satisfaction to us, I guess. Uh .. they burned down the camp because they thought that all the barracks had been so polluted and so full of excrement and bl ood and whatever -- there was just no way to preserve it and they moved us into a nearby um .. what had been German army camp, in fact, when I went back to Bergen-Belsen -- it is again a German army camp. You know .. they were two story buildings, it was a parade ground and typical kind of thing. And we were in there and that\u2122s when I would say -- I probably had a recuperation period of three to four months -- we got medical care. We got adequate \u2013 we certainly got food. We were treated like human beings. And it\u2122s amazing how fast you snap back a nd start thinking in terms of enjoying your life. I had missed really all my childhood -- really missed all my teenage years. Those were the days when I first -- when I all of a sudden became interested in girls. You know after I got better and I guess the girls became interested in boys and we would talk and you know .. there would be the normal umm \u2013 social \u2013 intercourse betwee n people where you would spend time together and enjoy each other\u2122s company. Uh .. one of the people who worked for the British Red Cross, a lady -- I spoke so me English because I had taken English in school, and probably spoke more than a passable English -- not really great but more than passable. She came into the barracks one day and said is there anyone here who speaks English and I said yeah, I speak English. So she needed, she was running a supply uh .. warehouse .. the British call it a Supply Dump but it\u2122s really not a dump, it\u2122s a warehouse for th e refugees. It was organized by the British Red Cross and order of St. John and I became an interpreter for her and later became attached to the British army as an interpreter and that\u2122s why I am wearing the uniform in these pictures. And amazingly enough, I kept in touch with this lady -- Mrs. Payton for all these years. She just passed away probably a year ago or two years ago. We would ex change Christmas gifts and letters and phone calls and she came to visit us once and what have you. And uh .. I worked for this British Supply D ump as an interpreter and those were wonderful days -- it was like .. well .. like being let out of a cage. You know, it was amazing. We could get the normal haircuts and we could wear normal clothes, we could talk to other people. We fe lt that we were equal to -- well, you know, after things like that, you really don\u2122t feel that you are equal to anybody and you feel always in intimidation of people in uniform or the sense of awe of that and probably to some extent, I have never lo st that entirely. Uh .. the respect for authority if you know what I mean. If somebody tells you that you are not supposed to do it, you just don\u2122t do it or else."

Uh .. then, I started really thinking seriously about what are you going to do with yourself. Where do you go from here? Uh .. most of the people that were with me at the time, the young people -- almost everybody who survived was young. There were no old people. I would say everybody was between 15 and 30. There was nobody older that made it. Most of the young people wanted to go to Israel which was then Palestine. Uh .. I felt that Is rael was an agriculture society which was what it was and that was not what I wanted to do. Uh .. I wanted to go somewhere else -- I wasn\u2122t sure. For some crazy reason, I \u2013 my father\u2122s sister and her husband had gone to the United States before the war and for some crazy reason I remember their address. I don\u2122 t know how I ever possibly did that but I did do it, O.K. And I wrote them a letter and made contact with them. So, I had an opportunity to go to the United States -- some other people who did not want to go to Israel wanted to go to Australia and you know, and we pretty much, except for Israel, could decide where we wanted to go. We could stay in Germany, some of the people who had been from Easter n Europe had wanted to go back. Not many of them, but some did. So \u2013"

I didn\u2122t want to work on a farm. I didn\u2122t want to do that. I wanted to work in some kind of a trade or business enterprise or that kind of thing. Uh \u2013 so .. uh, I decided that if I wanted to go .. I finally decided that I wanted to go to America, to the United States, and in order to do that, I had to really get into what was then the American Zone of occupation. It was very difficult to get from the British zone of occupation to the United States. So, this Mrs. Payton wrote a recommendation for me to the United Nations Headquarters in Munich and also a friend of mine who was a Canadian captain who I also met after the war in Germany did the same thing. And uh .. I had to get permissi on to take a train -- you know, everything was still in disarray. So I went to Munich and started working for the United Nations --, the United Nations Legal and Rehabilitation Administration doing the same thing again in a warehouse for relief supplies and I applied for going to the United States and came here in September 1946. I had the relatives -- my father\u2122s sister lived in Springfield, Massachusetts. I had some other relatives who lived in Springfield Illinois and we were given, be fore we left Germany, we were given ten dollars as money for -- we came on one of the tube ships the \ufb01S.S. Marlin\ufb02 -- I remember that. I remember having our first oranges aboard ship and orange juice. I never had orange juice before in my life and you know, just to see oranges in bins -- you know \u2013 I hadn\u2122t seen those in ten years. I hadn\u2122t seen eggs in ten years -- well, not ten years but five anyway. So, you know, this was an amazing sight. It is hard for anyone to imagine that kind of stuff. And uh .. since I had seven dollars left out of the ten dollars, when I came here, and that was not enough to go to Springfield, Illinois, so I chose to go to Springfield, Massachusetts. Which was that trai n fare here and that\u2122s basically."

I guess it was the sister of my grandmother or something like that and I stayed with her fo r a couple of weeks. First of all, it was very difficult to find a job in New York because that was the time when all the GI\u2122s were being demobilized and of cour se, they had first right -- as well they should -- for all the jobs. And uh .. I went to Springfield and I guess I hung around for about two or three weeks doing nothing and just enjoying this wonderful country and all the opportunities and I decided that I wanted to work in either a wholesale or a retail business. Springfield had kind of a small main street and I went from one end to the other trying to find a job in one of the stores and I did not find one. Later that night, somebody called my a unt who I stayed with in Springfield and said, \ufb01well, there\u2122s a pers on who has a store in an outlying section of Springfield who is looking for a stock boy\ufb02. I found a job there as a stock boy -- then you know, my problem was schooling. I never had more than eight years of schooling, so uh, what I need to do was first to get my school equivalency certificate. Which, I don\u2122t know if you have that here but in Massachusetts, you go to the department of education. They devise a plan for you -- evening courses that you have to take, correspondence courses that the State Department of Education gives and I, they devised a plan for me whereby I would get the high school equivalency certificate which I did. Meanwhile I continued working during the day, in that store. I then ended up at Northeastern University at night, there was a Springfield division of Northeastern University -- it was a high school equivalency certificate and I went to Northeastern for six years -- always continuing to work at my job -- gradually advancing from stock boy to sales person. Then I started going for my Master s to American Intern ational College -- another local college in Springfield. I never got my Masters -- I hope to take some courses now and maybe get it. I ultimately advanced to buyer and then general manager and then subsequently the business was sold to a large corporation and I became president then became president for some other department stores -- so, I at the height of my career, I ran eleven small New England Department stores for the Van Heusen shirt corporation and in 1982, I had an opportunity to buy the original store that I had started working at as a stock boy, which I did and I just sold it in March of 1992 and I am retired. That\u2122s basically it. I talked for a long time. If you still have \u2013"

I wasn\u2122t sure really what I would find, but I thought it would be a very lonesome place with maybe just a few old guys like myself standing there a nd saying Kaddish -- that\u2122s a Jewish prayer for the dead. I don\u2122t know if you\u2122re Jewish -- if you know. So, uh \u2013 instead we got there on a Sunday morning -- it had been turned into a memorial park and I was really amazed to s ee probably two hundred young Germans -- some with children going there and just looking around. Visiting this memorial park, you have all the mass graves that are still there which say \ufb01Here lie five thousand\ufb02, \ufb01Here lie five hundred\ufb02. \ufb01Here lie a thousand\ufb02. And so on and so forth. But these people had taken their Sundays to go and look at this and it made me feel that was kind of a nice thing. That at least these people wanted to know about this period of history."
