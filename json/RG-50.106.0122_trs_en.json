They put in his head in the cement mixer, and then they took him out, took him back to the \u0152 to the camp, to Dachau. But they just \u0152 just told him to put him in in there to grind him around a little bit.

In a minute, it was \u0152 it was gone, they tore at you, they kill you for a piece of bread.
