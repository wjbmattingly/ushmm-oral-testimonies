We, there was a large Jewish community in the town but due to my love for sports, most of my friends were non Jewish and that was never, never, never a problem until a certain time of my life."

She was always trying to get our attention by saying oh I have this terrible headache and so on and so, and I don\u2019t think she was a, she was not a very warm person because both I and my, my two brothers we felt she was inapproachable but we had a good, good time together. I had a brother who was two years older. Then I gota little baby brother when I, he was 12 years younger which embarrassed the heck out of me because I didn\u2019t think parents should engage in this sort of stuff. And but we were all very good friends. My brother died unfortunately very suddenly about 20 years ago on a pleasure trip and my younger brother I\u2019m in touch with and we have a good, very good relationship."

And my father, he used to say to us, be a decent 1 2 human being, that should be your religion and I think we, he followed that and we followed it too. And religion never meant anything to me and especially after all the things that happened later on. If I ever had any religious feelings I think I would have lost it pretty fast after all the things that happened to the Jewish people. Q; ...did you identify with being a Jew as a girl? ",

I was the only girl in my class and I was the only Jew in my class and there was never, never an unpleasant and you didn\u2019t think of yourself as a Jew. You thought of yourself as a German I think. "

I hated that stuff because I wasn\u2019t good at it because my legs were too long I guess. And but they instructed us the older people, and there was a terrific relationship.

Nobody ever told me anything. I played tennis, I played ping-pong. Nobody ever told me anything.

You know they play soccer and, and team sports more but there were very few places where there was nothing going on and that was a very important thing and once I got a little older, maybe 14 or so, we used to go to other little towns and compete there and that was really like a lot of fun and you met a lot of new people and, and it was, it was great."

Maybe you were playing field hand ball or something and why don\u2019t you pay more attention to your, your lessons and I think that turned me off more than anything else and I turned more to sports then instead of less, the way I thought I would.

And I knew exactly where to go in Berlin and study there and it didn\u2019t work out that way because by the time I was ready for it, I wasn\u2019t accepted anymore but uh I always wanted to be in sports."

You know we lived in this small hick town that did have a newspaper but I think it was more important to see that the chickens laid the eggs or whatever than you know all they would report the sports results of what happened in that town. But nothing really you didn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t get much information. There wasn\u2019t any television of course and the radio came much later so I don\u2019t think that I knew much about the Olympics until I got a lot later."

There were not that many Jewish people doing sports, let\u2019s face it and especially not girls. But I never, never felt any, any different. I mean we would go Sundays go to a nice swimming hole and go swimming and very often was the only Jewish person going so there was nothing. I felt perfectly comfortable."

But my brothers liked to watch it but they, they didn\u2019t do much by themselves, I mean my brother, my oldest brother skied a little bit but nothing very, not like I.

Heil Hitler and that was the end of that. So they just threw me out of the club and that was the end of my sports career as far as that was concerned. There was no Jewish sports per se in the town because everything was always mixed up you know. There was everybody did things together. But we, we were just locked out of everything. All the Jews were thrown out of the sports club. All the Jews, you couldn\u2019t go to, to a restaurant. I mean Jews were excluded from all German life. That started in 1933 and it was a horrible time. There was one Jewish restaurant in, in, in that town and everybody congregated there and everybody commiserated you know. What are we going to do, what\u2019s going to happen here. And it was a horrible life."

As a matter of fact, I had been accepted at the University for physical education in Berlin. For the spring semester and I wrote them a letter saying that I was Jewish and would it be advisable for me to come just then. And they wrote me a letter back literally saying wait until this thing blows over so everybody thought this is not going to last. But once Hitler had you know taken hold you were just afraid for your life if you, if you disobeyed or whether it was a Jew or whether it was a gentile, you did exactly as you were told, like in a real dictatorship."

I mean some of the friends stayed with us you know. But only in a. a very in a way they couldn\u2019t be caught to come to our house for instance. They had to come in the middle of the night and sneak in the back door if they wanted to visit with us. But a lot of them did change that, you know they went the other way and they figured well maybe Hitler is out god from now on and we will stay with him but it was, it was very bad. We didn\u2019t know what to do with ourselves, you couldn\u2019t go anywheres. You couldn\u2019t go into a restaurant, you couldn\u2019t go into a movie and especially in a small town. In a large town I guess you could bear to go to a movie every once in a while or a restaurant but not in a small town. Everybody knew everybody else and, and you just didn\u2019t do it and if you did it, \u2019'm sure, you would be punished according to Hitler\u2019s credo, whatever. 5 6"

            "answer": "Yes, some of them. There was a girl next door to me, we grew up together as babies. We were together every single day. She ate in our house more times than she ate in her own house and soon as Hitler came in she didn\u2019t know me any more and that was it. She had the chance to sneak into the house just like anybody else, you know other friends did. But she never made that attempt and maybe 2 years ago she wrote me a letter, the first trme I ever heard from her. My dear, darling you know stuff like this and I\u2019m so happy to finally find your address and the good times we had together and stuff like this. And I wrote her back. I said yes it was a good time but you didn\u2019t think so then because you didn\u2019t know me any more. That was the end of that friendship. (technical adjustment)"

            "answer": "It is absolutely impossible for anybody who hasn\u2019t gone through this what it was like to be among friends one day and the next day you would pass that same friend in the street and you wouldn\u2019t even say hello to each other because you were not, some you were not allowed to do it. Or some were afraid to do it but you just passed your friends up, friend or walk right on. And for instance, my younger brother is 12 years younger than I and he had all the kids from the neighborhood were his friends. They played together all non Jewish children and they all played together and all of a sudden after 1933 they started to beat him up and on his way to school, he had to go to a Jewish school because the other schools would not take him and on the way to school they beat him up. And I would walk him to school as often as I could. And they wouldn\u2019t beat him up when I was there but they would call him and me all kinds of horrible names and they would spit at us. And I wouldn\u2019t dare to touch those children because if I had touched a non Jewish child I would have been in a concentration camp the next day. So we really vegetated, there was nothing to do except worrying that, what\u2019s going to happen. My brother was working for a universal pictures and they had a, a studio in Berlin."

So he started to work in, in my father\u2019s factory. You know try to do make himself useful there because there was, he couldn\u2019t find a job of course, nobody would employ you. Gentile people were not allowed to, to but in Jewish stores for instance. If somebody got caught doing that they would take their pictures and hang them up at the city hall. I mean they really meant business. You know they were absolutely excluded from everything. 6 7"

I think we were just into ourselves more or less, you know everybody was worrying on their own but I don\u2019t think 1t was discussed all that much until I finally decided that this was no life, you know so, in from the spring of 1933 then finally in the, in the fall, I said I have to get out of here, I can\u2019t live like this. And I, I decided to go to England then and my parents agreed to it that I would go to England because it was a life of just vegetating. And talking about the same thing over, what is going to happen to us. Talking the same thing over and over again and not to come to any result. I mean nobody would know, knew what, what was going to happen."

And we, we ran there and I started a field hand ball, which is the same as football except it\u2019s like a combination of basketball and, and football. And I coached them and it takes in 11 people I think. I was the only girl on the team and I shot the only goal the first time we, we lost 7 to 1 and I shot the only goal. But after a while everybody got tired of this, you know the same people every day. It, it was horrible, that was they had an orchestra there, I mean there were many Jewish people who played the violin and, we, we played a little music but there really wasn\u2019t anything to do, so."

And my mother tried to teach me how to be a housewife, you know cooking and washing and ironing. That wasn\u2019t my deal so I decided or my parents decided I would go to England and find a school comparable to the one in Berlin that didn\u2019t take me and that\u2019s where I went in, I think it was in October of 1933."

I couldn\u2019t find a school that I wanted to go to, a physical education so I went to school to learn English. I figured you know better than nothing and it was OK. They had a, a track program that they immediately took me into it and I competed for them and won everything in sight, whatever I did. You know whether it was running or jumping or discus or whatever it was. And in the school I was a big shot. However um what was very odd. I was very friendly with the girls in you know some of the girls. I was never once invited to anybody\u2019s house. Now why I do not know. Maybe I was considered German. Maybe they, I was somehow discriminated against even though I tried to get away from discrimination when I went to England but somehow I was discriminated against. I mean when foreigners came to, to Laupheim, we made these people comfortable and they were our friends, that they came to our house. Not in England, not once in 9 months, 10 months, 11 months was I allowed to, was I invited into anybody\u2019s house. That really hurt."

And then in, in June of 1934, I competed in the British championships and I won and that was a really big deal because then already I felt like it was so satisfying to me to win this, you know and I was sure this would be known in Germany and it was like a revenge kind of thing you know. There you see, Iam a Jew but I have won the British championship so I was really very, very happy about that."

So a farmer let us have an old potato field and we tried to make it smooth, you know it\u2019s very rough, you know big clumps on there and we tried to, to smooth it out and we started our own Jewish hand ball team on there, hand ball is a game like soccer except that you don\u2019t kick the ball. You dribble it like a basketball and you pass it you know throwing it and it\u2019s a great game. And I coached all the fellows on the team and I was the only girl on the team and I shot the only goal in the first time when we lost 7 to 1. And we also tried to straighten out, next to the Jewish school there was a, a yard and we tried to straighten that out to do calisthenics on it. Because the soccer field was a, the handball field was a little bit out of the way so we tried to straighten that out but we had to fight the teachers\u2019 chickens and they used that same place for their activities and it was not very appetizing so we gave up on that pretty fast.

The day I won the British Championship was a fabulous day for me because I felt such pride in myself that I was able to do that because the Germans had told me I\u2019m inferior, I\u2019m no good, you know. And all of a sudden here I am the British champion, champion. And I was hoping that somehow word would go back to Germany so they would find out that I did this. And my father had come over to watch me, I thought. I thought he, that was the reason for his trip, trip to watch me compete but on the way back from the stadium, we found out differently. My, he didn\u2019t tell me right away. He waited until we got back to his hotel. But on the way back there, there were newspapers being hawked in the street and everything seemed like to be big excitement. We asked the taxi driver what\u2019s going on. And he said has something to do with the Nazis killing each other off. So we stopped the taxi and we got out, got the newspaper and it told the story about Hitler having killed off his best friend, plus about a thousand of his Nazi people because they, they complained about something and he wanted to show you. You just didn\u2019t do that. You did as you were told and when we thought that this might have been the beginning of the end for Hitler we couldn\u2019t have been more wrong because Hitler by killing off these people let everybody know if you want to stay alive, don\u2019t be a hero. So we got to the hotel (clears throat) excuse me. And there my father finally told me that I had to go back to Germany and the reason he could not write to me or tell me on the telephone was because there was this strict censorship of everything coming into Germany or going out of Germany. And he couldn\u2019t have dared to tell me that unless I came back the family was being threatened you know. Tell her to come back or else. So of course I decided immediately to go home, especially in view of what happened to Hitler\u2019s pals. If he can kill of his own people, what is he going to, to 10 11 a Jew who says no. And I went back, I think within a week I was back in Germany which was very, very hard to accept. I was supposed to be a member of the German Olympic team and that was something I couldn\u2019t understand and didn\u2019t understand for a very long time. I think I didn\u2019t understand it until I came over here and saw all the newspaper articles that had been written about my involvement with this time. The only reason I was supposed to be on that Olympic team was because the Americans, and the English and the French and a lot of the other nations threatened not to come to the 1936 Olympics due to the discrimination of the Jews. And Hitler wanted to make this the best Olympics ever. He used it as a propaganda vehicle, and he wanted of course the United States and all the big nations to be there. And this was the, the ruse that they used. I was the pigeon to help him get the 1936 Olympics settled and in Berlin. They were already making, building and change, you know making a stadium and everything but they were really afraid that the, that 1t would not be a good Olympics for them because the big nations weren\u2019t going to show up and that would take away from the, from the, from the games of course. So that\u2019s how I got on the German Olympic team and it was tough."

So I had to use the poor facilities of the Jewish clubs and compete there for them. And that was, was absolutely terrible because first of all there was no competition whatsoever.

You know everybody asked me are you going to be in the Olympics. You know what are you going to do. I was a nervous wreck I think and day and night, things were on my mind. It was really horrible. And my parents and I we didn\u2019t discuss it because I knew they were worried about it and they knew I was worried about it so we didn\u2019t talk about it.

And so you know it was like a dog chasing it\u2019s tail. And so it, they had, they had all kinds of, of, of ways to talk themselves out of it. They for instance, in 1935 for instance they got a little scared again so they called all the best Jewish athletes for a training course, an Olympic training course. I said 1n an article once, I think Snow White and the seven dwarfs would have done just as well as those athletes because they weren\u2019t any good.

I only noticed those in 1937 but I know that Brundage the, the head of the American Olympic committee went over to Germany to see what was going on because here was so much resistance in America against taking part in the Olympics so he went over there and I read later on doing some research that Berlin was manicured terrifically, everything was clean, every, all the offending signs, dogs and Jews not allowed etcetera, etcetera, they were all gone and Mr. Brundage was not a champion for Jewish causes as I have heard, never spoke to any Jewish people, he just let himself be lulled into some false sense of security by these Nazis saying everything is fine, we\u2019re doing everything we said we would do and he came back to the United States and said everything is fabulous over there and we\u2019ll be going."

We had, we had gymnastics, we had track and field. We played you know team sports. It was, it was very nice and the first day I was scared stiff because I didn\u2019t know how the girls would react to me and they greeted me, what\u2019s your name. My name 1s Bergman. OK you\u2019re Bergie from now on and, and, and we were all the best of friends, it was really very nice."

            "answer": "There must have been quite some protest again in the, in the Unites States. I know that a Senator or Congressman Sellar that he was pleading in the congress not to send a team over. There were, there were protest meets in Madison Square Garden, 20,000 people showed up. There was a lot of resistance and this must have been the reason why they invited me to come to Stuttgart and, and that as in 19, 1936 to, to compete at a meet there and it was really rough. You know when you the only Jew you know people, if the spectators knew that I was Jewish they didn\u2019t wish me well. I knew that much. And the, the officials were hostile. I think I mentioned that before. And it was very hard to, to compete against myself. So but I was so mad that I equaled the German record. The German record then was five foot three and I equaled that. I must have cleared it by, by 15 inches at the time. I was so angry. And usually you have three tries for each height you know you start at 4, 6 let\u2019s say. You have, if you do it the first time, fine. But you have to go over it by the third try otherwise you\u2019re eliminated. Well all the other girls were out by if they did about 4, 8 and they were all out and I kept going and going on and going. And every height I jumped over it on the first trme. So I did the 5, 3 and I think the, the officials most likely would have liked to poison but they didn\u2019t. And I was just so elated. I thought this is the first thing that ever happened to me, you know those lousy Nazis. And after that I went home I think and I wanted to share this with my family and I think this was the last time that I, I stayed in Stuttgart. I, I went home then and I said now this 1s 4 weeks before the Olympics start. I better go home and see what happens. So I went home and my parents were happy and my brothers were happy that I did this and I look for the mail everyday, what\u2019s going to happen, you know. What, what excuses are they going to use, that as only one, one other German girl who, who was capable of doing this right and how are they going to, if they don\u2019t want me in there how are they going to get rid of me. And I was really scared, aren\u2019t they going to break my leg or what are they going to do to, to eliminate me. But it was very simple. One day a letter came and it said in view of the fact that you have been doing very poorly lately we did not select you for the Olympic team. Heil Hitler and that was the end of it. And I said, I remember me sitting outside on the stoop and I got this letter and I must have used every profanity I knew and I knew a lot of them and at the same time, I had such an incredible feeling of relief. It\u2019s all over now, now I know what\u2019s going to happen to me. It was just like, like the biggest load was lifted off my shoulders and I know that was such a, a paradox. That I was angry, very very angry at the same time so relieved. And I don\u2019t remember a thing about the Olympics."

I recently got a letter from the National, German National Olympic committee and they invited me to be their guest of honor at the Atlanta Olympic games from July the 19\" until August the 3\" And although I have never gone back to Germany and they invited me before for some other occasion, I have accepted the invitation and I think it will be a very emotional thing for me but I, I think I said to my husband what goes around comes around and I think P\u2019ve got to make my peace with this thing at least even though it, it\u2019s it gnawed on me all these years you know and every time the Olympics come around, I I get mad as hell again, I say why, why did this happen tome. And but I\u2019ve got to make peace before I go wherever I\u2019m going to go, up or down, I don\u2019t know. So I\u2019m looking forward to that and I think it was a very gesture. They have tried to and the town where I come from also they have tried very hard to make amends. They take care of the Jewish cemetery. Not a single Jew went back to that town. But the, the citizens of the town take care of the cemetery and they have Jewish artists come. They have ,they have all kinds of activities to not to let the Jewish life that once was there die. And I think that is that helped me too because even though I would have, I never, never thought of going back. I was invited 3 times from the town to go and some people went and they had a very good time. I said no, I will never set foot on German soil again. And I won\u2019t. I don\u2019t know how long [\u2019ll last but Pll never go back. But I did accept that invitation and I\u2019m looking forward to it."

            "answer": "Any boycott that would have happened would have influenced only the Olympic games that it would not have been the huge success that Hitler expected from it but Hitler and Nazis they would have gone on no matter what, even if only one other country would have shown up to, to participate in the Olympics. I don\u2019t think it had anything to do with what he wanted to accomplish. He wanted to conquer the world and he, he, he would have gone forward no matter what. And I don\u2019t think that the Olympics in that respect had anything to do with it."

            "question": "...feelings about Jewish athletes in other countries who did participate...",
            "answer": "Well there are two trends of thoughts. They could have stayed home or they could have come and showed what a Jew could do. As a matter of fact, I think high jump was won by a Czech, a Jewish girl and I think that was like spitting in Hitler\u2019s eye, see a Jews, they can do it. And I think there were some that didn\u2019t come and that was their, whatever they wanted to decide about their lives. But I think they only hurt themselves and they, it didn\u2019t make any, it didn\u2019t make an impact. You know I think it had more, more impact for the Jews to go there and, and beat the Germans than, than to stay home and say I\u2019m not going. I have that 25 26 much respect for myself that I won\u2019t go. I don\u2019t think that that, was, the ones that did it I respect them for it but the ones who didn\u2019t they have my respect too because they did what I would have done, beat the Nazis. (End) 26"
