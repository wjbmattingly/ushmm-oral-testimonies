Or some were afraid to do it but you just passed your friends up, friend or walk right on. And for instance, my younger brother is 12 years younger than I and he had all the kids from the neighborhood were his friends. They played together all non Jewish children and they all played together and all of a sudden after 1933 they started to beat him up and on his way to school, he had to go to a Jewish school because the other schools would not take him and on the way to school they beat him up. And I would walk him to school as often as I could. And they wouldn\u2122t beat him up when I was there but they would call him and me all kinds of horrible names and they would spit at us.

My, he didn\u2122t tell me right aw ay. He waited until we got back to his hotel. But on the way back there, there were newspapers being hawked in the street and everything seemed like to be bi g excitement. We asked the taxi driver what\u2122s going on. And he said has someth ing to do with the Nazis killing each other off. So we stopped the taxi and we got out, got the newspaper and it told the story about Hitler having killed off his best friend, plus about a thousand of his Nazi people because they, they complained about something and he wanted to show you. You just didn\u2122t do that. You did as you were told and when we thought that this might have been the be ginning of the end for Hitler we couldn\u2122t have been more wrong because Hitler by killing off these people let everybody know if you want to stay alive, don\u2122t be a hero. So we got to the hotel (clears throat) excuse me. And there my father fi nally told me that I had to go back to Germany and the reason he could not write to me or tell me on the telephone was because there was this strict censorship of everything coming into Germany or going out of Germany. And he couldn\u2122t have dared to tell me that unless I came back the family was being threatened you know. Tell her to come back or else. So of course I decided immediately to go home, especially in view of what happened to Hitler\u2122s pals. If he can kill of his own people, what is he going to, to 11 11a Jew who says no. And I went back, I think within a week I was back in Germany which was very, very hard to accept. I was supposed to be a member of the German Olympic team and that wa s something I couldn\u2122t understand and didn\u2122t understand for a very long time. I think I didn\u2122t understand it until I came over here and saw all the newspaper articles that had been written about my involvement with this time. The only reason I was supposed to be on that Olympic team was because the Americans, and the English and the French and a lot of the other nations threatened not to come to the 1936 Olympics due to the discrimination of the Jews. And Hitler wanted to make this the best Olympics ever. He used it as a propaganda vehicle, and he wanted of course the United States and all the big nations to be there. And this was the, the ruse that they used. I was the pigeon to help him get the 1936 Olympics settled and in Berlin. They were already making, building a nd change, you know making a stadium and everything but they were really afraid that the, that it would not be a good Olympics for them because the big nations weren\u2122t going to show up and that would take away from the, from the, from the games of course. So that\u2122s how I got on the German Olympic team and it was tough."

You know when you the only Jew you know people, if the spectators knew that I was Jewish they didn\u2122t wish me well. I knew that much. And the, the officials were hostile. I think I mentioned that before. And it was very hard to, to compete against myself. So but I was so mad that I equaled the German record. The German record then was five foot three and I equaled that. I must have cleared it by, by 15 inches at the time. I was so angry. A nd usually you have three tries for each height you know you start at 4, 6 let\u2122s say. You have, if you do it the first time, fine. But you have to go over it by the third try otherwise you\u2122re eliminated. Well all the other girls were out by if they did about 4, 8 and they were all out and I kept going and going on and going. And every height I jumped over it on the first time. So I did the 5, 3 and I think the, the officials most likely would have liked to poison but they didn\u2122t. And I was just so elated.

I, I went home then and I said now this is 4 weeks before the Olympics start. I better go home and see what happens. So I went home and my parents were happy and my brothers were happy that I did this and I look for the mail everyday, what\u2122s going to happen, you know. What, what excuses are they going to use, that as only one, one other German girl who, who was capable of doing this right and how are they going to, if they don\u2122t want me in there how are they going to get rid of me. And I was really scared, aren\u2122t they going to break my leg or what are they goi ng to do to, to eliminate me. But it was very simple. One day a letter came and it sa id in view of the fact that you have been doing very poorly lately we did not select you for the Olympic team. Heil Hitler and that was the end of it. And I said, I remember me sitting outside on the stoop and I got this letter and I must have used every profanity I knew and I knew a lot of them and at the same time, I had su ch an incredible feeling of relief. It\u2122s all over now, now I know what\u2122s going to happen to me. It was just like, like the biggest load was lifted off my shoulders and I know that was such a, a paradox. That I was angry, very very angry at the same time so relieved. And I don\u2122t remember a thing about the Olympics."
