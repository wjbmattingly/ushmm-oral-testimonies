            "question": "Right.",
            "answer": "And tha \u0152 and of course, and then the Germans came in. The Soviets, we were a little bit afraid of the Soviets, not to be taken to \u0152 my father was afraid that they\u2122d 5 take him to Russia, whatever. And we thought that maybe ca \u0152 jer \u0152 he thought that maybe ki \u0152 when the Germans came in, they didn\u2122t \u0152 they weren't going to harm Polish Jews, only their own Jews, you know, maybe in Germany. But of course we discovered very quickly otherw ise. And after awhile, which I don\u2122t really remember how long, they formed a ghetto in my hometown, an d everybody from all the villages and different neighborhoods \u0152 our house was in the ghetto. And many people came to live with us, and there was a lot of starvation. Cause I remember people basically dying, I don\u2122t know how long it took after the ghetto was forming, but on our doorstep there would be dead people that have \u0152 from hunger, you know. And they were looking in garbage cans for potato peels or onion peels. And we basically, since we were in our hometown , I imagine my \u0152 my parents may have stored some food, so I don\u2122t remember being hungry at that point. Maybe I was too young to remember hunger, you know, and then we had three acti \u0152 akcjas they call it, you know. The first one we \u0152 we had relatives outside of town, they \u0152 we went there, to outside of town. My father, I think, remained in town, but my grandfather, when we came back, we discovered my father\u2122s father was killed, right across the street. He was shot right across the street from our house. And th en the second one, we went into hiding someplace outside of the city. But the third one, my father brought us to a Christian family, and he \u0152 they said that all workers should come and register, and he felt that he was young and strong, and he was going to register. And after a day or two, he will come and get us. And it took about a week and he 6 never came back. So my mother worried, she took us out and we started walking out \u0152 out of the \u0152 their \u0152 wherever they hid us, in their barn. And they were shotti \u0152 shooting after us, you know, when we \u0152 they saw that we were, you know, Jews, I guess. And we went back to our home, but eventually this akcja must have stopped, or whatever, but they came into our house and they chased us out. Out of the house. And I was, you know, very young, but my mother told me to grab \u0152 she had a \u0152 her girdle, which she had gold dollars sewn into it \u0152 to take that. As a child I was able to sneak by with that. And this is basically \u0152 that eventually saved our life. And then they made Judenfrei, our town was Judenfrei , but my grandmother on my father\u2122s side had survived, and then an aunt, my father\u2122s sister. And we went into the woods, and we \u0152 I guess my mother must have know n that across this river, was called the Kinester(ph), there were Jews, were still Jews there. And you \u0152 you were able to get there. So we were in the woods right acro \u0152 from the river, and hiding in there, and a young student came across. He knew my mother, and he said, you hide, he says, but during the night when the water gets shallow or whatever, he says, I will come and \u0152 and take you across. He carried me across, because I was the youngest one. My brother, my mother, my aunt and my grandmother, they walked across with packages, if they had \u0152 whatever they had. And we came to a little town, Potok Z oty, and before we know it, you know, a couple of days later, they made Judenfrei over there. And we went on to Buczacz , and in Buczacz we lived with a family that was in the ghetto, there was a ghetto there. And there were also many 7 akcjas and I remember that we always had to watch at night, people were watching. And I would go out during the day, of co urse, and play with other children. And right after the akcja I\u2122d come out and they\u2122d say, the children are dead, they\u2122re \u0152 they\u2122re gone. Or \u0152 and one day I came out and I saw a wagon full of dead children, with bleed \u0152 blood coming out of the \u0152 the wagon. You know, when \u0152 so I was always ready, I was afraid I\u2122d be left behind, being the \u0152 the youngest one. So as soon as they \u0152 I\u2122d be \u0152 at night or whatever, I\u2122d be the first one to get dressed and hold onto my mother to go into hiding. And basically af ter this \u0152 you know, after \u0152 I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m not sure of how much tim e passed, they made that town Judenfrei, and my \u0152 and we had an-another little town, my ki \u0152 father\u2122s relatives, cousins were there, and they \u0152 I don\u2122t how they communicated with my mother, but she decided to go there. And we went to Kopyczynce was that name. And we went in \u0152 we stayed with them. And of course then it started over ther e; the \u0152 the killings started over there. And my f \u0152 relatives\u2122 son, they \u0152 he was 17 or 18 years old, with other boys they built a bunker from that house that we lived in to under the street, and we felt it was very safe, you know, in the basement it was camouflaged, in the basement, and we were there. There were a couple of akcjas there, but this was like the last one. We we \u0152 all went into this bunker, we were 30 some odd people that went in there. And they must \u0152 they built a air \u0152 you know, some type of air, to give us air in the street. And either the noise or whatever, they discovered that we \u0152 that there was a \u0152 that we \u0152 there was a bunker under there, so they started digging from 8 the other side the street and came in that side. And then they realized that there had to be an opening in a \u0152 in the house, you know, that we \u0152 how we got in there. So they discovered us on both sides. They pulled everybody out, and they started throwing hand grenades in to the bunker. And basically, I don\u2122t know what happened to my mother, she either, you know , went to another part of the bunker, whatever. A \u0152 but I was holding onto my br other. And people died, and the dead bodies fell on top of us. A nd when it had quieted down, people came to rob, you know, the dead, to see what was there. And they hit my brother over the head with an axe, you know, to tr \u0152 they thought that he was still alive. But I was covered with bodies, so they pulled my foot, and th ey pulled off my shoe. And basically, I survived with that one shoe on, through the war. And then we \u0152 we \u0152 when \u0152 after we were discovered, we were the only ones, they thought we were already dead, or whatever, they were all dead people. At night we snuc k out of there, went into a \u0152 into another building, out onto a roof. We stayed there for a long time without any food. Being the youngest one, my mother worried, you know, my \u0152 my throat was closing up from not eating or drinking. But there was like a \u0152 a \u0152 a rusty tub, or whatever with the \u0152 with the water was leaking from the roof. And she found a straw and made me drink the water with a st \u0152 through a straw, because it was feathers and dirt in that water. And then we were discovered there. But if \u0152 they only robbed us. There were some other people from the bunker that survived, another three men, I think wi-with us. An d \u0152 you know, and they let us \u0152 they \u0152 9 they told us, this is the end, they\u2122re gonna \u0152 going to keep killing until all the Jews are gone, he says. But there is a labor camp outside of \u0152 of \u0152 that some Jews are working on the labor \u0152 in the labor camp outside of town. To us, of course, it was a strange town, we weren\u2122t there very long. It was a ghetto \u0152 walled ghetto. But we \u0152 these two men that were with us on that roof came down with us and looked for a place to go over the wall. And they found lik e an old couch or a chair, I don\u2122t know what it was, and my mother was able, and my brother, to get over. They threw me over the \u0152 th \u0152 over the fence, and we started running away from the ghetto. And it was \u0152 a man was leading a cow, so he told the guards at the \u0152 the gate, the Jews were escaping, and they start \u0152 they shot after us. Well, we were able to get to \u0152 I think one of the man got \u0152 you know, was shot, but we were able to get into the fields, and there was \u0152 the wheat was very high, and we hid there for a couple of days in \u0152 my mother had the feeling that we were heading towards that labor camp where Jews were still working. We got there and we \u0152 we s \u0152 we got there at night and there was nobody, the Jews used to run away at night. They were always afraid that at night they\u2122d come and get them. We were in a building that wasn\u2122t quite finished yet. They came to rob us again, and they \u0152 my mother had \u0152 at this point she had slipped the gold dollars into her shoes, she wore a high, like a boot, and they touched her boot that it was there. So they hit her to get off the boot and she refused. She said, we\u2122ll scream. They were allowed to kill Jews, but they weren\u2122t allowed to rob. So they got scared and ran away. And then morning came, and my 10 mother went into the camp, into that labor camp and ta \u0152 find out if she could work there. And the man that was in charge of labor \u0152 my mother happened to have been a beautiful blonde woman, so he picked her she could wash the floor in her \u0152 in his office. And he started talking to her, a nd he said, you know, you could pass as a Polish woman. So she says, but I have two children. So he said, two children, he says, do you have a \u0152 so she says, I have a son and a daughter. Says well, no son, I cannot help you with a son, but with a daugh ter. But a couple of days later he said to her, I \u0152 if you have any money left, he says, if you have any money, I have a friend that would be willing to hide you outside into \u0152 in a \u0152 outside in another farm. And my mother said she didn\u2122t \u0152 she was afraid to say that she had the money with her. But she said, I have money in the ghetto, and I will sneak back in the ghetto and dig it out. She wanted to make su re that he meant it. And sure enough, he did have a friend, he sends a worker from th at other farm to pick us up, you know, to \u0152 to take us \u0152 he wanted gold dollars, he didn\u2122t want \u0152 so we were very lucky to have gold and not paper money. And they took us to this other f \u0152 to this other farm, or to \u0152 you know what \u0152 what it was, it wa s \u0152 was a lot of people working for him, he was like the boss. And they put us in the room, they \u0152 it was an empty building. And there was a man that was assigned to br ing us food or take out our waste, or whatever. And he \u0152 the man di dn\u2122t tell us that he was Je wish passing himself off as a \u0152 he was the bookkeeper on that farm. But he was a Jew, and he passed himself off as a \u0152 you know, as a non Jew, but he was the one to provide us whenever he 11 could. I mean, mostly it was potatoes. An d being the youngest one after we were there for eight months, and then they started \u0152 rumors were he ki \u0152 brought back rumors saying that the Russians were coming, that the Russians were winning the war, and they were coming closer. And the partisans were in the woods, we were hoping we\u2122d get liberated. But eventually, of course, the \u0152 the war came closer, and I think that they \u0152 that somebody must ha ve discovered that there may be Jews in there. So they moved us to a still. But the \u0152 and the still in \u0152 these big barrels in a still, and \u0152 and then we went up to the \u0152 the roof, I don\u2122t \u0152 and they were going to bomb the Germans when they were leaving, they were going to bomb that buildings because they didn\u2122t want the Russians to get ahold of the liquor that was in there. And we heard them talking outside, you know, that this is next, they were going to [indecipherable] . And then the bombs started falling all around, they ran away. And we didn\u2122t really know if we were \u0152 if the Russians were coming, if the rai \u0152 so we stayed there for quite awhile with no food or anything, because they \u0152 they couldn\u2122t bring it to us over there. Eventu ally they came and they told us you\u2122re liberated, you\u2122re free. And at that point I was swollen, my stomach and my feet were swollen. And we got outside and we h itched a ride with the Russian soldiers as they were advancing to the next town. And \u0152 and that town they were \u0152 some Jews started coming out of \u0152 you know, there were a couple of families came out of hiding, and we stayed there. So basically , that was our liberation. And then we started running because the war was going on ri ght near us. We tried to go closer to 12 the Russian border. And other people were coming out of labor camps, and they had typhus, and my mother and I both got typhus . And we \u0152 that part is completely like way \u0152 vague in my mind. I know that I couldn \u2122t walk, that I lost my hair. But I, you know \u0152 and eventually, as it quieted down, we worked ourselves back to our hometown, hoping that there would some body be left, somebody would be \u0152 you know, we didn\u2122t know what \u0152 the fate of my father, we just \u0152"
