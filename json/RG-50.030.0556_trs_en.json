And we thought that maybe ca \u2014 jer \u2014 he thought that maybe ki \u2014 when the Germans came in, they didn\u2019t \u2014 they weren't going to harm Polish Jews, only their own Jews, you know, maybe in Germany. But of course we discovered very quickly otherwise. And after awhile, which I don\u2019t really remember how long, they formed a ghetto in my hometown, and everybody from all the villages and different neighborhoods \u2014 our house was in the ghetto. And many people came to live with us, and there was a lot of starvation. Cause I remember people basically dying, I don\u2019t know how long it took after the ghetto was forming, but on our doorstep there would be dead people that have \u2014 from hunger, you know. And they were looking in garbage cans for potato peels or onion peels. And we basically, since we were in our hometown, I imagine my \u2014 my parents may have stored some food, so I don\u2019t remember being hungry at that point. Maybe I was too young to remember hunger, you know, and then we had three acti \u2014 akejas they call it, you know. The first one we \u2014 we had relatives outside of town, they \u2014 we went there, to outside of town. My father, I think, remained in town, but my grandfather, when we came back, we discovered my father\u2019s father was killed, right across the street. He was shot right across the street from our house. And then the second one, we went into hiding someplace outside of the city. But the third one, my father brought us to a Christian family, and he \u2014 they said that all workers should come and register, and he felt that he was young and strong, and he was going to register. And after a day or two, he will come and get us. And it took about a week and he This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So my mother worried, she took us out and we started walking out \u2014 out of the \u2014 their \u2014 wherever they hid us, in their barn. And they were shotti \u2014 shooting after us, you know, when we \u2014 they saw that we were, you know, Jews, I guess. And we went back to our home, but eventually this akcja must have stopped, or whatever, but they came into our house and they chased us out. Out of the house. And I was, you know, very young, but my mother told me to grab \u2014 she had a \u2014 her girdle, which she had gold dollars sewn into it \u2014 to take that. As a child I was able to sneak by with that. And this is basically \u2014 that eventually saved our life. And then they made Judenfrei, our town was Judenfrei, but my grandmother on my father\u2019s side had survived, and then an aunt, my father\u2019s sister. And we went into the woods, and we \u2014 I guess my mother must have known that across this river, was called the Kinester(ph), there were Jews, were still Jews there. And you \u2014 you were able to get there. So we were in the woods right acro \u2014 from the river, and hiding in there, and a young student came across. He knew my mother, and he said, you hide, he says, but during the night when the water gets shallow or whatever, he says, I will come and \u2014 and take you across. He carried me across, because I was the youngest one. My brother, my mother, my aunt and my grandmother, they walked across with packages, if they had \u2014 whatever they had. And we came to a little town, Potok Zloty, and before we know it, you know, a couple of days later, they made Judenfrei over there. And we went on to Buczacz, and in Buczacz we lived with a family that was in the ghetto, there was a ghetto there. And there were also many This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And I would go out during the day, of course, and play with other children. And right after the akeja I\u2019d come out and they\u2019d say, the children are dead, they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re gone. Or \u2014 and one day I came out and I saw a wagon full of dead children, with bleed \u2014 blood coming out of the \u2014 the wagon. You know, when \u2014 so I was always ready, I was afraid I\u2019d be left behind, being the \u2014 the youngest one. So as soon as they \u2014 I\u2019d be \u2014 at night or whatever, I\u2019d be the first one to get dressed and hold onto my mother to go into hiding. And basically after this \u2014 you know, after \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not sure of how much time passed, they made that town Judenfrei, and my \u2014 and we had an-another little town, my ki \u2014 father\u2019s relatives, cousins were there, and they \u2014 I don\u2019t how they communicated with my mother, but she decided to go there. And we went to Kopyezynce was that name. And we went in \u2014 we stayed with them. And of course then it started over there; the \u2014 the killings started over there. And my f-\u2014 relatives\u2019 son, they \u2014 he was 17 or 18 years old, with other boys they built a bunker from that house that we lived in to under the street, and we felt it was very safe, you know, in the basement it was camouflaged, in the basement, and we were there. There were a couple of akcjas there, but this was like the last one. We we \u2014 all went into this bunker, we were 30 some odd people that went in there. And they must \u2014 they built a air \u2014 you know, some type of air, to give us air in the street. And either the noise or whatever, they discovered that we \u2014 that there was a \u2014 that we \u2014 there was a bunker under there, so they started digging from This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And then they realized that there had to be an opening in a \u2014 in the house, you know, that we \u2014 how we got in there. So they discovered us on both sides. They pulled everybody out, and they started throwing hand grenades into the bunker. And basically, I don\u2019t know what happened to my mother, she either, you know, went to another part of the bunker, whatever. A \u2014 but I was holding onto my brother. And people died, and the dead bodies fell on top of us. And when it had quieted down, people came to rob, you know, the dead, to see what was there. And they hit my brother over the head with an axe, you know, to tr \u2014 they thought that he was still alive. But I was covered with bodies, so they pulled my foot, and they pulled off my shoe. And basically, I survived with that one shoe on, through the war. And then we \u2014 we \u2014 when \u2014 after we were discovered, we were the only ones, they thought we were already dead, or whatever, they were all dead people. At night we snuck out of there, went into a \u2014 into another building, out onto a roof. We stayed there for a long time without any food. Being the youngest one, my mother worried, you know, my \u2014 my throat was closing up from not eating or drinking. But there was like a \u2014 a \u2014 a rusty tub, or whatever with the \u2014 with the water was leaking from the roof. And she found a straw and made me drink the water with a st \u2014 through a straw, because it was feathers and dirt in that water. And then we were discovered there. But if \u2014 they only robbed us. There were some other people from the bunker that survived, another three men, I think wi-with us. And \u2014 you know, and they let us \u2014 they \u2014 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But there is a labor camp outside of \u2014 of \u2014 that some Jews are working on the labor \u2014 in the labor camp outside of town. To us, of course, 1t was a strange town, we weren\u2019t there very long. It was a ghetto \u2014 walled ghetto. But we \u2014 these two men that were with us on that roof came down with us and looked for a place to go over the wall. And they found like an old couch or a chair, I don\u2019t know what it was, and my mother was able, and my brother, to get over. They threw me over the \u2014 th \u2014 over the fence, and we started running away from the ghetto. And it was \u2014 a man was leading a cow, so he told the guards at the \u2014 the gate, the Jews were escaping, and they start \u2014 they shot after us. Well, we were able to get to \u2014 I think one of the man got \u2014 you know, was shot, but we were able to get into the fields, and there was \u2014 the wheat was very high, and we hid there for a couple of days in \u2014 my mother had the feeling that we were heading towards that labor camp where Jews were still working. We got there and we \u2014 we s \u2014 we got there at night and there was nobody, the Jews used to run away at night. They were always afraid that at night they\u2019d come and get them. We were in a building that wasn\u2019t quite finished yet. They came to rob us again, and they \u2014 my mother had \u2014 at this point she had slipped the gold dollars into her shoes, she wore a high, like a boot, and they touched her boot that it was there. So they hit her to get off the boot and she refused. She said, we\u2019ll scream. They were allowed to kill Jews, but they weren\u2019t allowed to rob. So they got scared and ran away. And then morning came, and my This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And the man that was in charge of labor \u2014 my mother happened to have been a beautiful blonde woman, so he picked her she could wash the floor in her \u2014 1n his office. And he started talking to her, and he said, you know, you could pass as a Polish woman. So she says, but I have two children. So he said, two children, he says, do you have a-\u2014 so she says, I have a son and a daughter. Says well, no son, I cannot help you with a son, but with a daughter. But a couple of days later he said to her, I\u20141f you have any money left, he says, if you have any money, I have a friend that would be willing to hide you outside into \u2014 in a \u2014 outside in another farm. And my mother said she didn\u2019t \u2014 she was afraid to say that she had the money with her. But she said, I have money in the ghetto, and I will sneak back in the ghetto and dig it out. She wanted to make sure that he meant it. And sure enough, he did have a friend, he sends a worker from that other farm to pick us up, you know, to \u2014 to take us \u2014 he wanted gold dollars, he didn\u2019t want \u2014 so we were very lucky to have gold and not paper money. And they took us to this other f\u2014 to this other farm, or to \u2014 you know what \u2014 what it was, it was \u2014 was a lot of people working for him, he was like the boss. And they put us in the room, they \u2014 1t was an empty building. And there was a man that was assigned to bring us food or take out our waste, or whatever. And he \u2014 the man didn\u2019t tell us that he was Jewish passing himself off as a \u2014 he was the bookkeeper on that farm. But he was a Jew, and he passed himself off as a\u2014 you know, as a non Jew, but he was the one to provide us whenever he This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I mean, mostly it was potatoes. And being the youngest one after we were there for eight months, and then they started \u2014 rumors were he ki \u2014 brought back rumors saying that the Russians were coming, that the Russians were winning the war, and they were coming closer. And the partisans were in the woods, we were hoping we\u2019d get liberated. But eventually, of course, the \u2014 the war came closer, and I think that they \u2014 that somebody must have discovered that there may be Jews in there. So they moved us to a still. But the \u2014 and the still in \u2014 these big barrels in a still, and \u2014 and then we went up to the \u2014 the roof, I don\u2019t \u2014 and they were going to bomb the Germans when they were leaving, they were going to bomb that buildings because they didn\u2019t want the Russians to get ahold of the liquor that was in there. And we heard them talking outside, you know, that this is next, they were going to [indecipherable]. And then the bombs started falling all around, they ran away. And we didn\u2019t really know if we were \u2014 if the Russians were coming, if the rai \u2014 so we stayed there for quite awhile with no food or anything, because they \u2014 they couldn\u2019t bring it to us over there. Eventually they came and they told us you\u2019re liberated, you\u2019re free. And at that point I was swollen, my stomach and my feet were swollen. And we got outside and we hitched a ride with the Russian soldiers as they were advancing to the next town. And \u2014 and that town they were \u2014 some Jews started coming out of \u2014 you know, there were a couple of families came out of hiding, and we stayed there. So basically, that was our liberation. And then we started running because the war was going on right near us. We tried to go closer to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.
