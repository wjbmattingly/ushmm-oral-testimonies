The reason, my wife decided when we got married, because when we had children they had problems at school, you know, is it Zyper, 1s it Zipper? So we thought the best thing is that we change the spelling, and we did. Now, I was born in a city, second biggest city in Poland, called Lodz, L-o-d-zed, and that\u2019s where I lived til I was deported from Lodz."

And with a Jewish family in the 1930\u2019s Orthodox, divorce was as bad as death, or even worse, you know. It was such a terrible thing for a Jewish family, you know. So as far as I knew, you know, after awhile, you know, I -- I thought my mother was dead, and I didn\u2019t see my mother and that was it. So I was just left with my grandparents, of course, and my father, which my father worked, so I didn\u2019t see that much of him either.

But I suppose because we lived in a big city, it was a second -- as I said, second biggest city in Poland, and you know, there was a million inhabitants before the war, and 25 percent, like 240,000 were Jewish people.

I didn\u2019t even mean -- didn\u2019t realize what it means there\u2019s a war. And they said, you know, Germany and the Germans will come in and they- | [indecipherable] and this was carry on like that til 1939, you know, and then 1939, you know, in September \u201939, one morning I was in bed, you know, my father came to me and he said he has to go away. And I said, why are you going away, you know? So I says -- I thought to myself, now here a mother I haven\u2019t got, now I won\u2019t even have a father.

Of course, he couldn\u2019t have been more wrong, but nevertheless he left and I never saw my father again. He run away to Russia and I suppose conditions in Russia were not that good either because at that time the Russians already were together with the Germans, they split up Poland in half, you know, some part went to Russia and so on. So he decided to come back, and he managed to get to Warsaw, because Warsaw was by then -- the whole of Poland was already occupied by the Germans or by the Russians. But Warsaw was a occupied part of Poland by the Germans. L6dz was part of Germany, they annexed it. That\u2019s the Third Reich. So he couldn\u2019t get back to us, you see?

And -- and you know, to -- to a -- to a child, even nine year old, you know, being brought up as -- in a very Orthodox family, you know, to destroy a synagogue is -- 1s the most terrible thing that could happen. But of course everything changed, you know. We -- we weren\u2019t allowed to travel on normal transport like on trams. We had trams in Lodz, we couldn\u2019t travel on trams. I found out because I never traveled on trains, you know, but you couldn\u2019t travel on a train. Jewish doctors couldn\u2019t practice medicine, Jewish teachers couldn\u2019t go to school. And of course, there was no school, you know. I left school when I was -- in June. That\u2019s where they had stopped it in -- in Poland at the time and I was about nine and a half years old, and I never went back to school. That was my education in life. And every day different things happened.

And food was scarce because Jewish shops weren\u2019t opened, they closed them up. We weren\u2019t even allowed to walk on pavements, you know. But of course children like my age, you know, we got away with it, we walked. But the thing was, you know, they called a je -- a -- a Jewish man, you know, with the long beard, which they knew he was a Jew, you could recognize the Jewish people that were Orthodox, especially in -- in Lodz. They used to -- first thing they did, you know, took out the beard off and I -- and I asked why are they doing, you know, I didn\u2019t ask the Germans, I asked my grandmother, why do they do that?

So he lived on bread an-and potatoes and things like that, you could still get some. But it was getting more and more difficult and then they decided, you know, to recognize every Jew that is not recognizable, we have to wear a Star of David and in -- in some places, like in [indecipherable] they used to wear one in the front. We had to wear one in the front and the back so that the minute th-they saw you they -- they knew who you were, so you get beaten up, especially the older people, not -- you know, and the children started stealing food wherever they could, you know, to bring home."

I was already, you know, I was 14 years old, 14 and a half. I was already -- to my way of thinking, I was already a grown up person already. And when they put us in the -- those trucks, do you know, it was just impossible to survive. It was so packed, you couldn\u2019t breathe. And do you know, today, I said that many times, you know, I feel ashamed, not only for other people, for myself, what can happen to a person, that when we stopped -- th-th-the train stopped somewhere after a day or so, and -- and there were a few people were dead, you know. First of all there -- there was no water to drink. You remember like I said to you, we\u2019re -- it was July, August, in the summer in Poland, the heat.

How can a human being think like that? To be that selfish, you know? But unfortunately that\u2019s how it is, you know. I -- I saw children stealing a piece of bread from their father. I saw a father s-stealing a piece of bread from -- from a child. And do you know I\u2019m a father today and a grandfather and I think I would rather die than do that. But if I would have a father then, would he steal from me, or would I steal from him? Maybe. I don\u2019t know, you know. You\u2019ve got to be in that position to realize.

May -- I definitely say today no, but I don\u2019t know. You have to be in those circumstances to realize whether you can do it or not. And we traveled for a few days and it was less and less people in -- in -- in -- in the coaches, you know. And eventually one morning at about, must have been five, six o\u2019clock in the morning, the train stopped, and you know, we could see through the slats, you know, of the truck, something written up, Oswiecim, and then it said Auschwitz and I -- didn\u2019t mean anything to me, an-and the grown up people say oh, it\u2019s a concentration camp, and I didn\u2019t know what a concentration camp was. And they opened it, the gates and straight away in German they started shouting, raus, raus, raus. And there were people sort of wearing striped things and striped caps and we did -- still didn\u2019t understand that. And it was -- like I said, 1t was in the summer and it was hazy, the sun was hazy because it was very early in the morning. And there was like a haze, yellow haze, and then we saw chimneys and we saw that\u2019s bakeries, or [indecipherable] whatever it 1s there, and -- and then, as I said, we had to jump down, you know, and it was pretty high, and some of those people that were there, they were Jewish inmates of Auschwitz that helped people to jump down. We weren't allowed to take our suitcase, they said, you leave everything behind. When you get to where we going, we get our luggage back, you know, and of course, we didn\u2019t. And then we had to go through a selection committee. And here we go again, I was lucky again. Being in the factory, we were a main transport that went through the selection committee. Women, children, disabled people, everybody went through. We were 500 and odd people. But the train had many more people on it, and all the others had to go -- the selection, there were German officers with dogs and batons, you know, and everywhere -- and they were rushing them, and you know it was right and left, right and left.

And some of them -- and there were screams, you know, because they -- they -- they took the child away and the woman they said to go to the left. And of course, can you imagine a mother giving up a child. So the mother run towards it, she was beaten, but she was left with the child.

They were gassed and put in -- and how can a human being do that? Taking a child, a p -- a person, a woman, a disabled person, whoever and put in a gas oven, and then burned?

I mean, maybe not to the -- that extent and maybe not to the Jewish people, but it\u2019s happening. And us they took to -- the people that went to the left, we all went to showers.

But tha -- on the 14 of August 1945 was the first lot that came here from Theresienstadt concentration camp. They were there -- they were liberated in Theresienstadt, then they went to Prague and from Prague they came to England. Originally they came to the north of England to a beautiful place called Windermere. And I don\u2019t know the reason why they brought them there, but people think it\u2019s because they were scared to bring them into a capital like London or Manchester, because they didn\u2019t know who they were bringing in here. They are bringing young people that were five years interned. Now, how are they going to behave? Now, within a few months they dispersed them, they sent them to London and Manchester, Liverpool and so on. Now, the people that I met, of course, they were the Londoners."

They were -- they were survivors originally from Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia. Very, very few from Germany, but they were all a mixture of [indecipherable]. And we -- we came -- and when they came to London they lived in hostels and then they decided -- the CBF decided that they should form a club to keep the youngsters together. And they formed a club and it was like any other club. We did a lot of sport. One of our members, which today is the chairman of our society, which after the club finished we formed a society, became British lightweight champion in weightlifting. Now him they made British very quickly because he was very good. He represented England in the Olympic games, in the commonwealth games and of course in the Maccabee in Israel. And we had -- and some went to college, some went to university. Some became doctors, lawyers. You know, we had one who was working 1n -- in university as a lecturer, you know, and so -- well, actually two. One was a mathematician, you know, and we did -- they did quite well. And most of them went to trades or business, and -- and -- but the most important thing was that because of the club, we kept together. Now, eventually, you know, we got married and had children, we couldn\u2019t have a club, because it wouldn\u2019t work, because we wouldn\u2019t have time to go to a club. And we -- you couldn\u2019t carry on playing football, basketball, cricket and so on. We had other -- we had to work and we had to look after families.

So much so that this year we had our own reunion every -- we have a reunion every Sunday -- every year in the first Sunday in May, because most of the people are liberated in that time. So, we have a fa -- a reunion of everybody. People come from the States, people come from Israel. This year nobody came from Israel, the reason being that a lot of the people in England went to Israel on the sixth and seventh of May to be -- and they had their own reunion in Israel, the Israeli people put on the reunion, and it was also because it was the 60\" anniversary of the birth of the state of Israel, so they went. So we\u2019re a very close family and I think this helped a lot, because when you think that very few of us of that whole group needed psychiatric help, or being counseled -- I don\u2019t know anybody who was counseled through the years, because we had such a family, we had. And a lot of survivors that were in England or in Britain, I should say, needed help because they were on their own. And you know, they didn\u2019t have anybody. Like my children -- I mean, I never had a brother, never had a sister, but my children had a lot of uncles and aunts. And up til today, they call my friends, many of them, I mean it\u2019s, it\u2019s not everybody, uncle or aunt. You see, because this -- I think this helped us a hell of a lot."

And I said to her in Yiddish, you know, I -- I don\u2019t think this 1s a good business being here. And the next thing I know I had six doctors around me. And one of them said, do you know what happened to you? I said, I was talking to my wife and I must have fallen asleep.

I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going -- how long I\u2019m going to live, but I certainly survived 24 hours. And I ask again, why?

So I am thankful to them. I\u2019m thankful -- if there is a God, I thank God for what happened to me and I had a very good life."

And it was one of the better things I did in life, by doing it, because I felt then that I owe it to people -- I owe it to the people that did not survive when I speak to young students, I say -- when they ask me, why do you come and give talks? Surely it hurts you, you -- brings back memories. I said, doesn\u2019t matter what it does, I said, there are -- there were families, you know, that not one member of them survived. Now who is going to tell their story? Because all the stories are very similar, you know? So I decided then that I want to do a lot before it\u2019s too late. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve still got. So for the last sort of 15 years, 20 years, I\u2019ve been going more and more to speak to students mainly, you know, to tell them what happened because of hatred, bigotry, anti-Semitism, racism, and the main -- the main thing I tell them is hate. And I insist -- my last two words to the students is, do not hate. And never give in, never give up. I don\u2019t hate and I certainly didn\u2019t give up. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s why I survived, but I feel it -- it\u2019s a little bit of a reason why, maybe. The rest -- 99 percent is -- was luck. It wasn\u2019t that I was clever, it wasn\u2019t such a -- that I was such a good person or something. No, it was luck and never have the -- the willpower, maybe, to live."

Teachers that have retired, or they want to be in teaching profession any more, and they devote their time for that. They do it -- they get paid for it, naturally, otherwise they couldn\u2019t do it. And they do seminars for young people. But the Holocaust Education Trust is mainly interest in taking young people to Auschwitz. Now that,  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

There\u2019 ll be teachers from each school. Because it\u2019s not as a school, it\u2019s about 80 schools. They take two students from a school, you see, local, 1n London, plus teachers, plus journalists. And they take them just for one day, they go very early in the morning and come back late. And they go to Auschwitz, they go to birk -- to Krakow, Auschwitz and Birkenau. The main thing is Auschwitz and Birkenau. And they come back and they\u2019ve got the bef -- but, so what I do, or people like me, we come and talk to them, because they know very little about the Holocaust. They know very little about the second World War. But now it\u2019s a thing that they\u2019ve got to learn in school, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a must, it\u2019s not whether they want or not. But how much is not -- doesn\u2019t come into it because how much they can just learn one hour in three months about the Holocaust. So they go- so by doing -- what the Holocaust Education Trust does is they bring them -- they get them together, and they listen to a Holocaust survivor. Then they get another seminar, then they go to Auschwitz and when they come back they go to write about it, what they thought of it, what they- the whole thing and they\u2019ve got to send it in to the Holocaust Education Trust, and a panel sits then pick four schools of two children each and they got to come back to the Houses of Parliament or to the House of Lords, here in -- and start presenting their stories, what they think, they\u2019re int -- they\u2019re interviewed, they ask questions, you know, and usually some of the survivors are also there, a few of us. And then one of them is voted as ambassadors of the year. So what they have to do, they\u2019ve got to go to other local schools and tell them all what they saw, what they heard. And being young people I am very much involved in it because I lungya -- I like young people, and I think it\u2019s very, very imporstant they should know what happened, because -- and they are lovely students, most of them.

And they cannot understand when I tell them no, I do not hate the German people. Why should I hate people for -- most probably the people that they think I should hate are not alive today. You know, they\u2019re grandparents. And most German people are the same as any other people. Why should I blame something -- body for what their grandfather did, you know? Do I ask me -- do I forgive them? Now the people that did it, I haven\u2019t got the right to forgive. If there is a God, God can forgive them. The others are the people that died can forgive.
