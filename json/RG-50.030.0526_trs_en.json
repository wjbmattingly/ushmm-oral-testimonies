The reason, my wife decided when we got married, because when we had children they ha d problems at school, you know, is it Zyper, is it Zipper? So we thought the best th ing is that we change the spelling, and we did. Now, I was born in a city, second biggest city in Poland, called L\u00f3dz, L-o-d-zed, and that\u2122s where I lived til I was deported from L\u00f3dz."

And with a Jewish family in th e 1930\u2122s Orthodox, divorce was as bad as death, or even worse, you know. It was such a terrible thing for a Jewish family, you know. So as far as I knew, you know, after awhile, you know, I -- I thought my mother was dead, and I didn\u2122t see my mother and that was it. So I was just left with my grandparents, of course, and my father, which my father worked, so I didn\u2122t see that much of him either.

So in a way, I think, from what I know now that we had a -- a reasonable comfortable life, you know, I -- I remember having enou -- my own be droom, which is almost unheard. But I suppose because we lived in a big city, it was a second -- as I said, second biggest city in Poland, and you know, there was a million inhabitants before th e war, and 25 percent, like 240,000 were Jewish people. I went to a Jewish school, you know, I -- it wasn\u2122t a cheder or a Orthodox school, it was a Jewish school, but we learned Hebrew much more so than -- we didn't learn the Bible or things 3 like that. Hebrew we learned and -- and all the other things that children of six, seven, eight learn, you know, it was -- it was almost a normal lif e I had. I don\u2122t -- after awhile I don\u2122t think I missed that I haven\u2122t got my mother, you know , really.

I guess I wasn\u2122t out that much, only played in the yard with other children, even with Poles. Course, lots of times, you know, there were anti-Semitic remarks, but there -- it didn\u2122t mean that much to me, I didn\u2122t quite understand what it meant, you know, why are they calling me dirty Jew, or so mething like that.

I didn\u2122t even mean -- didn\u2122t realize what it means there\u2122s a war. And they said, you know, Ge rmany and the Germans will come in and they -- I [indecipherable] and this was carry on like that til 1939, you know, and then 1939, you know, in September \u212239, one morning I was in bed, you know, my father came to me and he said he has to go away. And I said, why are you going away, you know? So I says -- I thought to myself, now here a mother I haven\u2122t got, now I won\u2122t even have a father. Oh no, he says, don\u2122t worry at all, I\u2122ll be back within six m onths because there\u2122s going to be a war and the German armies are going to invade Poland and the first thing they will do is take all the young men away, you know, but you and your grandmother and gr andfather and the children a -- they will -- won\u2122t touch them, it\u2122s only the young people. Of course, he couldn\u2122t have been more wrong, but nevertheless he left and I never saw my father again. He run away to Russia and I suppose conditions in Russia were not that good either because at that time the Russians already were together with the Germans, they split up Poland in half, you know, so me part went to Russia and so on. So he decided to come back, and he managed to get to Warsaw, because Warsaw was by then -- the whole of Poland was already occupied by the Germans or by the Russians. But Warsaw was a occupied part of Poland by the Germans. L\u00f3dz was part of Germany, they annexed it. That\u2122s the Third Reich. So he couldn\u2122t get back to us, you see? But that\u2122s what I had found out, later. But 8 \u212239 when he left, you know, and within a few weeks, of course, the German armies came in and things completely changed straight away."

I-I -- I hadn\u2122t seen it, but everybody was talking about it, first of all, as soon as they came in they de stroyed most of the synagogues in -- in -- in Poland, in L\u00f3dz especially, you know. And -- and you know, to -- to a -- to a child, even nine year old, you know, being brought up as -- in a very Orthodox family, you know, to destroy a synagogue is -- is the most terrible thing that could happen. But of course everything changed, you know. We -- we weren\u2122t allowed to travel on normal transport like on trams. We had trams in L\u00f3dz, we couldn\u2122t travel on trams. I found out because I never traveled on trains, you know, but you couldn\u2122t travel on a train. Jewish doctors couldn\u2122t practice medicine, Jewish teachers couldn\u2122t go to school. And of course, there was no school, you know. I left school when I was -- in June. That\u2122s where they had stopped it in -- in Poland at the time and I was about nine and a half years old, and I never went back to school. That was my education in life. And every day different things happened. I mean, ya -- you know, we couldn\u2122t -- we weren\u2122t allowed to walk -- not that people came out of [indecipherable] they were too frightened to come out, but you know you\u2122ve got to eat, you\u2122ve got to buy food. And food was scarce because Jewish shops weren\u2122t opened, they closed them up. We weren\u2122t even a llowed to walk on pavements, you know. But of course children like my age, you know, we got aw ay with it, we walked. But the thing was, you know, they called a je -- a -- a Jewish man, you know, with the long beard, which they knew he was a Jew, you could recognize the Jewish people that were Orthodox, especially in -- in L\u00f3dz. They used to -- first thing they did, you know, took out the beard off and I -- and I asked why are they doing, you know, I didn\u2122t ask the Germans, I asked my grandmother, why do they do that? 9 They said, purely to humiliate him, you know, because they know it\u2122s the most terrible thing to have that beard cut off. And then they made him wash the pavement, for no reason at all, just to degrade him, to humiliate him, to -- and you know, you\u2122re not even 10 years old, you cannot understand why and you keep asking question and there is like always, there\u2122s -- there\u2122s no answers why."

So he lived on bread an-and potatoes and things like that, you could still get some. But it was getting more and more difficult and then they decided, you know, to recognize every Jew that is not recognizable, we have to wear a Star of David and in -- in some places, like in [indecipherable] they used to wear one in the front. We had to wear one in the front and the back so that the minute th-they saw you they -- they knew who you were, so you get beaten up, especially the older people, not -- you know, and the children started stealing food wherev er they could, you know, to bring home."

But you know, as young as I was, you know, I -- I realized, you know, you don\u2122t take people to work that are disabled people, old people, women a nd children. And my grandmother was hidden 22 somewhere and I went down and they took me, they slung me on the lorry and it was a similar scene, funny enough, like in \ufb01Schindler\u2122s List.\ufb02 And I -- I don\u2122t know why it was so bad and I was alone, I s -- I would have thought why did I want to escape? Maybe because I thought to myself I\u2122ll be alone and I wanted to be back with my grandmother and I jumped off the lorry. And the Germans were inside the yard, you know, had they stepped out they would have seen me, they would have shot. I\u2122m sure they would ha ve hit me because I wouldn't have been that far away. Anyway, I -- I was lucky once again and I run and I hid myself in the house and I stayed there for hours. And I remember a distant cuz - well, it -- a distant c ousin came and he also escaped, also jumped off the lorry and he escape and I remember -- I remember like today and he says, come on, let\u2122s go home, cause we lived in the same sort of block or yard or something.

And as we arrived, you know , th-there were cattle trucks waiting for us, you know, which I couldn\u2122t understand, you know, and they just said, take a suitcase, get onto the cattle trucks. We were helped by the Jewish police. And this is when it started. We thought, 27 you know, that things are bad in -- in -- in the ghetto, but that\u2122s when our trouble started, between 1944 and 1945, those were the worst -- the worst year, well it was less than a year that happened to me that stand out in my -- mostly in my -- first of all I was already older. I was already, you know, I was 14 years old, 14 and a half. I was already -- to my way of thinking, I was already a grown up person already. And when they put us in the -- those trucks, do you know, it was just impossible to survive. It was so packed, you couldn\u2122t breathe. And do you know, today, I said that many times, you know, I feel ashamed, not only for other people, for myself, what can happen to a person, that when we stopped -- th-th-the train stopped somewhere after a day or so, and -- and there were a few people were dead, you know. First of all there -- there was no water to drink. You remember like I sa id to you, we\u2122re -- it was July, August, in the summer in Poland, the heat. You know, you talk about your sort of 90 degrees or something like that, packed like sardines. And people, you know, elderly people, people that ha-had problems were dying and -- and I\u2122m so ashamed today, you know, when I think of it, how could I have ever done that, say thank God they died, there\u2122ll be more room for us, you know? And of course at that time it -- that\u2122s how I felt, but -- and mo st people, and -- but today when I think back, like I wasn\u2122t human any more, you know? How can a human being think like that? To be that selfish, you know? But unfortunately that\u2122s how it is, you know. I -- I saw children stealing a piece of bread from their father. I saw a father s-stea ling a piece of bread from -- from a child. And do you know I\u2122m a father today and a grandfather and I think I would rather die than do that. But if I would have a father then, would he steal from me, or would I steal from him? Maybe. I don\u2122t know, you know. You\u2122ve got to be in that position to realize. It\u2122s easy to say how could he do it, but today, you know what, I\u2122ve got a family and I\u2122ve got -- I\u2122m not short of -- of anything, you know. When I say anything, food, or drink, or -- I can say that. Would -- how would it have been 28 in those circumstances, you know, if I was starving and knowing that my child has got a piece of bread, could I have stolen it? Ma y -- I definitely say today no, but I don\u2122t know. You have to be in those circumstances to reali ze whether you can do it or not. And we traveled for a few days and it was less and less people in -- in -- in -- in the coaches, you know. And eventually one morning at about, must have been five, six o\u2122clock in the morning, the train stopped, and you know, we could see through the slats, you know, of the truck, something written up, Oswiecim, and then it said Auschwitz and I -- didn\u2122t mean anything to me, an-and the grown up people say oh, it\u2122s a concentration camp, a nd I didn\u2122t know what a concentration camp was. And they opened it, the gates and straight away in German they started shouting, raus, raus, raus. And there were people sort of wearing striped things and striped caps and we did -- still didn\u2122t understand that. And it was -- like I said, it was in the summer and it was hazy, the sun was hazy because it was very early in the morning. And there was like a haze, yellow haze, and then we saw chimneys and we saw that\u2122s bakeries, or [i ndecipherable] whatever it is there, and -- and then, as I said, we had to jump down, you know, and it was pretty high, and some of those people that were there, they were Jewish inmates of Auschwitz that helped people to jump down. We weren't allowed to take our suitcase, they sa id, you leave everything behind. When you get to where we going, we get our luggage back, you know, and of course, we didn\u2122t. And then we had to go through a selection committee. And here we go again, I was lucky again. Being in the factory, we were a main transport that went through the selection committee. Women, children, disabled people, everybody went through. We we re 500 and odd people. But the train had many more people on it, and all the others had to go -- the selection, there were German officers with dogs and batons, you know, and everywhere -- and they were rushing them, and you know it was right and left, right and left. And then we real ized what was happening, that the people going to 29 the right were disabled people, women with babies , with children. And some of them -- and there were screams, you know, because they -- they -- they took the child away and the woman they said to go to the left. And of course, can you imagine a mother giving up a child. So the mother run towards it, she was beaten, but she was left with the child. And they said they\u2122re going to take them to showers, but we found out soon afterwards, you know, beca -- from the guards, from the Jewish people that were [indecipherable] that an hour after a -- that train arrived in Auschwitz, in Birkenau, you know, those people were dead. They were gassed and put in -- and how can a human being do that? Taking a chil d, a p -- a person, a woman, a disabled person, whoever and put in a gas oven, and then burned? It just -- but unfortunately I learned. I\u2122m now an old man so I\u2122ve learned that it\u2122s -- appear it\u2122s happening today. I mean, maybe not to the -- that extent and maybe not to th e Jewish people, but it\u2122s happening. And us they took to -- the people that went to the left, we all went to showers. They were actually showers, they were not gas -- they were not gas cha -- crematoriums, gas chambers. And we had to take all our clothes off and we never saw it again. They shaved everybody, whoever had hair, wherever you had hair had to be shaved, women and men. And we came out and they gave us striped clothing. And of course the women went separate to a different one, we went separate. And had a -- one of those caps. They didn\u2122t tattoo us at the time, it was -- I don\u2122t know whether that was because we were with a group, or whether they didn\u2122t tattoo any mo re people, but they -- but we had a number, so at that time that was -- I wasn\u2122t Ziggy Shi pper, I was 83303. Not that anybody called me by the number or so, but that\u2122s what I had writ -- a stripe, think here."

They asked them, and they were soon told, you know, what it is. But you know, even then, as a 14 year old boy, you doi -- i-it didn\u2122t sort of -- possibly, personally, I was lucky. I came with my grandmother and I knew my grandmother is still there. I had no siblings, you know, so I didn't have to worry about where -- where\u2122s my little sister, or my brothe r, or -- or -- nothing s -- sort of happened to me that I should feel in a terrible state, you know?

But anyway I came, like I said, and for the firs t six months I didn\u2122t do any work, all I did was go to cinemas. I\u2122ve never seen a film before in my life. Now I certainly made up in those six months. And then one day they -- somebody came to me and said, you know, there is a club that young Holocaust survivors, boys and girls meet in a certain area in London in Belsize Park, as it happens, and why don\u2122t you go there one day? On a Saturday night they\u2122ve got a dance, so why don\u2122t you go? I said all right, so I decided I\u2122ll go, you know, so I arrived at the door, you know, it -- they had a dance in a church hall. I knocked on the door and they opened. And I said some words then that I -- in the book what -- what Sir Martin Gilbert wrote about us, the boys that came here -- that came to England,. and I said -- the first thing I said when th -- I opened the door, I found my family again. That\u2122s what they meant to me, more than my mother. And from then on, my life completely changed, you know. I jo ined the club straight away and I spent more 56 time in the club than anywhere else. I got a job, my mother said and my stepfather said every person should have a trade. What would you like to do ? I said, I haven\u2122t got a clue what I want to do. My mother said, would you like to go to sch ool and [indecipherable]. I say, I\u2122m too old for school. At 17 I was -- I can\u2122t go back to school, you know, I sort of -- so they said, what about tailoring? I said okay. So I went to t-tailoring. I worked in tailoring for about six or seven years and I must tell you I hated every minute of it. By then I already found th -- in that club, a refugee girl as well, but they came in 1939, she came with her parents to England. We started dating, you know, and I said to her, do you know what? The day the man will say that I\u2122m a qualified tailor, this will be the day I give up tailoring and I\u2122ll never hold a needle in my hand. And I kept to it. He said, now you can -- he says, you\u2122ll have mo re money. I said, thank you very much, but now I\u2122m leaving the job. And going back to that girl, we started going out together. Eventually we got married. And I opened a delicatessen business, that didn\u2122t go very well eventually. So she said, you know, my father is in business, but if you go in, you can go much bigger in the business, we -- why don\u2122t you go in? And the fath er said, why don\u2122t you come in with me, and I did. It was a stationery and printing business. And eventually, after a few years, I left him and he retired and I got bigger and I did wholesale, I had my own print place. I had retail shops in London. But you know my mother -- going back to my mother , you know, I realized then, you know, when I got married I realized, you know, ther e must -- she must have had a good reason why she left. You know, things are not so ha -- black and white. I realize people do get divorced, you know. But I regret -- I\u2122ve got a regret, that -- I\u2122ve got very few regrets, but one regret is -- which you did ask me, and I never asked my mother til she die d, and she died, unfortunately, very young, why? What was the reason? And up to today I don\u2122t know the reason, you know, why she left, for 57 what, whether there was another person involved, or whether she just couldn\u2122t live with my father, or vice versa.

            "answer": "Now -- the funny thing was that we -- very, very few of us Polish boys -- Polish young -- youngsters wanted to go back to Poland. Don\u2122t ask me why. I -- when I think back today I don\u2122t know why. But unfortunately some of them went back and were killed by the Poles. You see, the Poles were very scared of the Jewish people coming back and trying to claim their properties. I mean, those people lived in those properties for five years, and all of a sudden a Jew will come and take their properties away. They were beaten, they were killed in many, many places. There was a pogrom in Kielce, you know, in Poland, where they killed a lot of Jewish people, you know, because they were terrified that they\u2122re go ing to take away their homes. I can understand that, you know. Why they should kill, I don\u2122t know . They didn\u2122t have to kill them not to give them back their homes, but they did. I -- I aske d questions, you know, but I didn\u2122t look properly til years later, you know, but like I said, you know, I was in business and I got married in 1954. In 1956 my wife became pregnant. October -- the ei ghth of October I went to the hospital, she was in labor. And I will never forget that mome nt, it was the happiest moment in my life, you know. And you know, when I walked in -- because at that time there wasn\u2122t such a thing as a husband watching the birth of a child, you know, and that woman presented me with that bundle, 58 and I looked at it and I couldn\u2122t stop crying. And I said, at last, I know I\u2122ve got a family of my own, you know. When I look at that child, it was the greatest thing, that whenever I say that and my younger daughter is there -- because a few years later I had another daughter, she says, Dad, what about me, you know. And she knows how much I love both of them, there is absolutely no different. But you know, it did something to me , you know, that I cannot explain, you know. I know that every parents is -- it\u2122s the most happiest day of their life when their child is born. But the Holocaust survivor, when he\u2122s lost almost everything -- I mean some of my friends, they\u2122ve got -- they had families, they had siblings a nd they\u2122ve got not one member of the family survived, you know. You know, and I was lucky enough that my mother survived. Unfortunately -- I mean, she was lucky enough to see grandchild ren, you know, which was a great thing for me and for her. And unfortunately I think she died thinking that I\u2122ve never forgiven her for leaving me. And when we discussed it, a nd I used to -- about leaving me , she never said why and I never asked, but I said, if you would have stayed, most probably both of us would have been dead today. So, at least both of us survived. And I certainly did -- did not hold it against her. You know, I did, most probably as a child, but in later years, you know, when I came to England, you know, it never crossed my mind that she\u2122s guilty of something. And she got on better with my wife than she got on with me because she had it in the back of her mind that I must hate her, or -- and I know, I -- I -- I loved her as much as I co uld, you know. I\u2122m sure I didn\u2122t love her as a normal child will love a mother, you know. But I did love her, I respected her, you see? But then, as I said, I had children, and eventually they grew up. Good kids. They produced three children each. You know, I\u2122ve got six grandchildren and I think how lucky I am, you know. In 1981, I -- unfortunately I did work very hard, you know? I also played very hard, you know. I -- I smoke and I drunk and I goed -- went to casinos and I -- I -- I went to football, I did everything. I wasn\u2122t 59 a father like I -- I even apologized to my two daughters for not being a father like I should have been. They don\u2122t think so, but you know. But today they think I\u2122m the gr eatest thing alive. I don\u2122t know why, you know. They are wonderful, wonderful kids. And when I think I came to England, without education I couldn\u2122t read and write. Never mind English, I couldn\u2122t hardly read and write in Polish. And the -- my oldest grands on has a master\u2122s degree in mathematics and statistics. From a poor little boy to come to th is country, to meet he r Majesty the Queen and shake hands with her. To meet the prime minister of this count ry and go to his place where he lives and where he works, why me? In 1981, as I sa id, I worked very hard. I had to go to hospital and they sent me home, they said there\u2122s not hing wrong. Four hours later I was in hospital again with a heart attack and they -- I think it\u2122s cutting out."

And I don\u2122t know the reason why they brought them there, but people think it\u2122s because they were scared to bring them into a capital like London or Manchester, because they didn\u2122t know who they were bringing in here. They are bringing young people that were five years interned. Now, how are they going to behave?

And they had homes, you know, for the survivors and for ref ugees that came before the war to Britain, you see? And that group that I was with is the group that came. They were -- they were survivors originally from Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia. Very, very few from Germany, but they were all a mixture of [indecipherable]. And we -- we came -- and when they came to London they lived in hostels and then they decided -- the CBF decided that they should form a club to keep the youngsters together. And they formed a club a nd it was like any other club. We did a lot of sport. One of our members, which today is th e chairman of our society, which after the club finished we formed a society, became British lightweight champion in weightlifting. Now him they made British very quickly because he was very good. He represented England in the Olympic games, in the commonwealth games and of course in the Maccabee in Israel.

And most of them went to trades or business, and -- and - but the most important thing was that because of the club, we kept together.

And we -- you couldn\u2122t carry on playing football, basketball, cricket and so on. We had other -- we had to work and we had to look after families. So they decided to form a society, which we still got up til today, which is called the 45 Aid Society, I think I told you that. We raise money 62 for charity, for eng -- in England and in Israel, mainly for children. Because we feel we were children when it happened to us, we want to help children."

Some came back. Those that w -- came back, had to come back within a year, otherwise they wouldn\u2122t have been let into Britain. And some of them didn\u2122t want to come back, and they stayed in Israel. 63 And we\u2122ve got quite a big grou -- well, not a big group, but a biggish group in Israel of those people. So much so that this year we had our own reunion every -- we have a reunion every Sunday -- every year in the first Sunday in May, b ecause most of the people are liberated in that time. So, we have a fa -- a reunion of ever ybody. People come from the States, people come from Israel. This year nobody came from Israel, the reason being that a lot of the people in England went to Israel on the sixth and seventh of May to be -- and they had their own reunion in Israel, the Israeli people put on the reunion, and it was also because it was the 60th anniversary of the birth of the state of Israel, so they went. So we\u2122re a very close family and I think this helped a lot, because when you think that very few of us of that whole group needed psychiatric help, or being counseled -- I don\u2122t know anybody who was counseled through the years, because we had such a family, we had. And a lot of survivors that were in England or in Britain, I should say, needed help because they were on their own. And you know, they didn\u2122t have anybody. Like my children -- I mean, I never had a brother, never had a sister, but my children had a lot of uncles and aunts. And up til today, they call my friends , many of them, I mean it\u2122s, it\u2122s not everybody, uncle or aunt. You see, because this -- I think this helped us a hell of a lot."

When I said the word sleep, I realized -- I was conscious enough then to realize that I didn\u2122t fall asleep, that I must have gone, you know, and they resuscitated me. And then later I found out, you know, they told my wife and my two daughters, who were th ere already, that my chances of surviving were nil, you know. That the -- the next 24 hours and they said go home and pr ay. And my wife said, you know the Germans tried five years to kill him and they didn\u2122t succeed. So -- and all I can tell you, three weeks later I walked out without me dication. And that was 27 years ago. I don\u2122t know how I\u2122m going -- how long I\u2122m going to live, but I certainly survived 24 h ours. And I ask again, why? Why did I escape such a lot of incidents, such a lot of -- the gas chambers, a massive coronary? I don\u2122t know, I can\u2122t, you know, there\u2122s no answer to that. But I cannot thank enough the British people what they did for me, first of all they liberated me. They let me come into their country and I could do whatever I wanted, I had no restriction of movement, I had no restriction of business, I could open any business I wanted, you know? So I am thankful to them. I\u2122m thankful -- if there is a God, I thank God for what happened to me and I had a very good life."

I mean, people committed so many things against people, against God, they were punished for it. But a six month old baby being violated, put in a gas chamber? No, I couldn\u2122t accept the answer and I was very, very much agains t religion, so much so when it came to Yom Kippur, which is, you know, we got to fast 25 hours, we mu -- all we are allowed to do is to pray, I used to eat twice as much as normal that day. I used to go to football, I used to go to dog racing, I used to do everything, I -- I hated the religion so much. But you know -- because, you know, like everybody else wif -- you always blame God for good or bad, you know? And then I thought -- you know, you get older, you\u2122ve got a family and you start thinking. Well, I cannot tell anybody that there is a God and nobody can tell me there is no God. I don\u2122t know, and nobody else knows. We -- we think we know. But what I cannot understand, why, if there is a God, why do we blame God for everything? We are the people that doing all those things. God doesn\u2122t tell us. It doesn\u2122t say anywhere God tell us to kill people, to let people starve. You see, I -- I mean, six million Jews alone were killed, for no reason. One and a half million children were killed. And not only Jews were killed. The Gypsy population of -- of Europe was almost wiped out. Homosexuals were killed. Disabl ed people were killed, including German disabled people. And it\u2122s only us that doing it, it\u2122s not God. When I look today, you know, that I looked -- I watch television, when I speak to students and I ask th em what they ask me, that old question, can it 67 happen again, I say, don\u2122t you ever watch television or read the newspapers and you what\u2122s happening in Rwanda, Darfur and other places like that?

            "answer": "Well, I think it was both. I -- for the first, I would say 25 years, very few of us Holocaust survivors spoke about it, whether it was [indecipherable] I think there\u2122s many reasons, you know. When we first survived and came to this country, we were 15 - 16 year olds, you know, would people believe us if we told them, you know? They would say well, you know, kids exaggerate, children, oh it\u2122s a lot of nonsense, you know. And then, you know, we were so wrapped up in -- in work and in marriage and in bringing up a family, now are we going to tell the children? Is it fair to te ll the children what you went through? But the children started reading. My two daughters at least, you know, that\u2122s t -- watching films and -- and then asking questions, you know, and they realized what it was. And then, you know, the time came that some of us decided we\u2122ve got to do is talk about it, you know. And my two daughters insisted on going to Auschwitz, and going to L\u00f3dz where I\u2122m -- was born. They wanted to see we -- I\u2122m very close to my daughters and I -- they are very close to me and they wanted -- I said -- I said, why do you want to go? You -- you know all about it, you\u2122ve seen it, you\u2122ve read about it. They said no. We want to feel what you went through. I said, that\u2122s not a -- what for? Anyway, they -- they said if I don\u2122t go, after time and again refu sing, you know, they said right, we go alone. So I 70 said I can\u2122t allow that, so we all went. And it wa s one of the better things I did in life, by doing it, because I felt then that I owe it to people -- I owe it to the pe ople that did not survive when I speak to young students, I say -- when they ask me, why do you come and give talks? Surely it hurts you, you -- brings back memories. I said, do esn\u2122t matter what it does, I said, there are -- there were families, you know, that not one member of them survived. Now who is going to tell their story? Because all the storie s are very similar, you know? So I decided then that I want to do a lot before it\u2122s too late. I don\u2122t know how long I\u2122ve still got. So for the last sort of 15 years, 20 years, I\u2122ve been going more and more to speak to students mainly, you know, to tell them what happened because of hatred, bigotry, anti-Se mitism, racism, and the main -- the main thing I tell them is hate. And I insist -- my last two words to the students is, do not hate. And never give in, never give up. I don\u2122t hate and I certainly didn\u2122t give up. I\u2122m not saying that\u2122s why I survived, but I feel it -- it\u2122s a little bit of a reason why, maybe. The rest -- 99 percent is -- was luck. It wasn\u2122t that I was clever, it wasn\u2122t such a -- that I was such a good person or something. No, it was luck and never have the -- the willpower, maybe, to live."

Teachers that ha ve retired, or they want to be in teaching profession any more, and they devote their time for that. They do it -- they get paid for it, naturally, otherwise they couldn\u2122t do it. And they do semi nars for young people. But the Holocaust Education Trust is mainly interest in taking young people to Auschwitz. Now that, 76 after that rabbi, Rabbi Barry Markus did that, they decided they would be able -- they can afford to take two groups of children, around 200 people -- there would be like 160 children. There\u2122ll be teachers from each school. Because it\u2122s not as a school, it\u2122s about 80 schools. They take two students from a school, you see, local, in London, plus teachers, plus journalists. And they take them just for one day, they go very early in the morning and come back late. And they go to Auschwitz, they go to birk -- to Krak\u00f3w, Auschwitz and Birkenau. The main thing is Auschwitz and Birkenau. And they come back and they\u2122ve go t the bef -- but, so what I do, or people like me, we come and talk to them, because they know very little about the Holocaust. They know very little about the second World War. But now it\u2122 s a thing that they\u2122ve got to learn in school, it\u2122s -- it\u2122s a must, it\u2122s not whether they want or not. But how much is not -- doesn\u2122t come into it because how much they can just learn one hour in three months about the Holocaust. So they go -- so by doing -- what the Holocaust Education Tr ust does is they bring them -- they get them together, and they listen to a Holocaust survivor. Then they get another seminar, then they go to Auschwitz and when they come back they go to wr ite about it, what they thought of it, what they -- the whole thing and they\u2122ve got to send it in to the Holocaust E ducation Trust, and a panel sits then pick four schools of two children each and they got to come back to the Houses of Parliament or to the House of Lords, here in -- and start presenting their stories, what they think, they\u2122re int -- they\u2122re interviewed, they ask questions, you know, and usually some of the survivors are also there, a few of us. And then one of them is voted as ambassadors of the year. So what they have to do, they\u2122ve got to go to other local schools and tell them all what they saw, what they heard. And being young people I am very much involved in it because I lungya -- I like young people, and I think it\u2122s very, very imporstant they should know what happened, because -- and they are lovely students, most of them. I\u2122ve never had any problems, you know? 77 It\u2122s as quiet as anything, you know, and I talk to them for about an hour or so and they ask questions and -- you know, and --"

            "answer": "Well, all different. Some are a bit silly ones, you know, like naturally young people, they want to know whether I met Hitler, you know. I ha ven\u2122t been invited to tea by Hitler, but -- but that th -- one of the main question, it\u2122s always asked is, do I hate the German people. And they cannot understand when I tell them no, I do not hate the German people. Why should I hate people for -- most probably the people that they think I should hate are not alive today. You know, they\u2122re grandparents. And most German pe ople are the same as any other people. Why should I blame something -- body for what their grandfather did, you know? Do I ask me -- do I forgive them? Now the people that did it, I haven\u2122t got the right to forgive. If there is a God, God can forgive them. The others are the people that di ed can forgive. I certainly haven\u2122t got the right to forgive, but I certainly do not hate, and I beg of you, when I talk to them, do not hate. Because this is not an answer, to hate. You are the one that will suffer if you hate. So no, I -- I love the questions. Some, like I said, are silly, but some are very [indecipherable] how they -- the usual thing, how did you survive? I wish I could tell them. I don\u2122t know. It\u2122s one of those things. People that are -- there are some students that are religio -- religious and they, do you think God wanted you to stand -- to stay -- to save you so that you can tell the story? I said maybe, I don\u2122t know. But I feel it\u2122s very important it should be told. We\u2122ve got to have awareness of what happened."

There won\u2122t 78 be anybody, you know, to substantiate the story. So people say well, is it true, is it not, and you can be the one to say, well, I met a Holocaust su rvivor.
