I was shipped off to the next town, which was about 12 mile -- 12 kilometers from our town, where there was a teacher. As a matter of fact, my father worked there one year as a teacher, after he lost his job, which I talked about in the -- on the videotape. And I used to be away from them for awhile. And later on, I was sent to a high school in Koven, which is the big city not far from where we lived. And again, I -- I missed my family. I was there only one year. This was my formal education. And then when I was 16, I left town also, to go in search of a -- learning a professional job in the city of Lodz. And sin -- fr-from then on, I was away for quite a few years, returned about a year or two before the war came. Then a year before the war, I came -- I -- I got married. A son was born. His -- My wife\u2122s name USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 4 was Rifka. This was in 1938. I omitted it from my videotape. And my son\u2122s name was Benjamin -- Benjamin.

He was born in ni -- you know, we were married in 1938, he was born in 1939 and in 1942, in September, a week before Rosh Hashanah, the 23 days in the month of Ell, Hebrew month, they were all taken out and shot, including my little boy.

            "question": "She talked about the trip to Vilno, but didn\u2122t talk about your trip to Povorsk.",
            "answer": "Yeah, well, it started with Povorsk. A -- I -- I was not there when the tragedy happened. I was in the Soviet Union, working a coal mine. And I found out about -- I knew -- I -- I -- the Soviet -- I -- I read the Soviet press, even though I worked for a slave labor camp, we had a cultural life. There were -- there was a library with papers and books which you could read. As a matter of f act, I ha -- even had the privilege of subscribing for -- to -- to the Pravda, one of the Soviet papers, for a short while, for a few months, because the librarian, who was also a internee like myself, had about half a dozen papers he could give, to give us a semblance of kind of freedom and culture. So, he gave me the privilege of sur-surpri -- which wa s dirt cheap, it was pennies. But, to me it had a big value besides reading it, I could read it in the library. But I could sell it afterward for the purpose of rolling cigarettes. I, myself, was smoking. And we used to have a kind of -- there was some commerce in the camp. Womens used to come out from USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 5 outside and had a little -- put like a -- a kiosk in the camp. And if you had money, you could buy things. They used to bring in milk, he used to bring in tobacco, which was sold by the glass. Actually, that was not even tobacco, it was tobacco roots, which were chopped up with an ax and you rolled it in newspaper. Now, once a mon -- once a week, I used to sell my bread ration in this commerce in -- intercamp commerce -- intracamp commerce, and buy tobacco. But I had to buy a newspaper. A newspaper cost 10 rubles. So, when I had five newspapers or six newspapers a week, I could sell five of them and one use for my own needs and with others I us ed to get the 50 rubles and use it to buy the tobacco roots, see? So, while I had it, I was in very good shape, financially. I didn\u2122t have to sell my bread ration. So -- and in the press, there wasn\u2122t much about the Final Solution. The Soviet press didn\u2122t write much about it, they wrote about atrocities committed against the Soviet people, none that mentioned Jews. Of course the particular Jews [indecipherable] designed to be exterm inated. But -- And they knew about it, of course, but they didn\u2122t -- I remember when the revolt broke out in the Warsaw ghetto, there was a little column, one column, but about four or five inches tall, about a revolt in the Warsaw ghetto, which was liquidated by -- the Warsaw ghetto was liquidated by the German -- the German occupiers. Not mentioni ng much about just one word to the Jews. The ghetto, of course, they had to mention the ghetto, because there\u2122s only one kind of a ghetto, a Jewish ghetto. So they mentioned it. So there wasn\u2122t much about it. But one day, when the forces -- the Soviet forces approached not far from where my town was located, I wrote a letter from camp to the -- somebody in the ci -- town council, asking if USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 6 there\u2122s any information about my family. It so happened that the town was not liberated yet. It was still -- there was still the -- the -- the front was there in the -- the next city. For quite awhile, places changed hands back and forth, but I -- another town close to it, was already liberated. And a friend of mine, who was a former partisan, where my brother was also a partisan of the sa -- the same place, the same time. He was already liberated and he was working in the post office. And when they saw my name -- my return address, with my name on it, he opened the letter and he sent it to my brother. He read it, sent to my brother and my brother answered it. And he -- he just wrote me that he is -- he knows that he -- he is -- he is alive, everything is -- all is well. He works now as -- doing -- as a guard in an NKVD, secret -- secret police farm. And he sent me -- he would sent me some money. Course, they used to speculat e theirselves by [indecipherable] and he knew that I was in bad shape, so he send me some money. A few days later, I got a letter from one of my friend -- a former brother-in-law of mine, as a matter of fact, and then his brother, describing what happened and how it happened and who survived and did not survive. So I knew -- then I find out what happened. And I had in mind that my wi -- in 1945, after the war, the Poles and the Soviets conclude an agreement to let -- this ha -- by the way, this information is in the videot ape, but I\u2122m telling you so you understand what I am talking about -- had an agreement to let all of those who were former Polish citizens, til \u201a39, coo -- provided they are Jews or Poles, not Ukrainians or Russians, could get out, back to Poland. And after a year, they find -- this is a long story, but doesn\u2122t make any sense, it repeats again. I left the Soviet Union, you know, and then came to Poland. But, I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 7 ha -- I thought I\u2122ll be able to go by this town and see what -- you know, where the place was, at least, fo-found out what happened. But luckily, luckily, I could not stop there, because th-they routed me through a different way, through Belarus, through Minsk and -- but I always dreamed about coming back to Povorsk and putting up a monument, which was impossible during Soviet days. First of all, they didn\u2122t allow any monuments which specifically said Jews perished there. Soviet citizens, yes, but not Jews. So, i-in -- in -- and at that time, this -- this was a very dangerous place to be, because Ukrainian nationalists already harassed the Soviet army and killed the Jews, just like the Poles did after the war, yeah. So, is good that they did not go through. But I -- I -- It was a kind of -- became an obsession for me to come and put up a monument. Now, when you co -- then they st -- they started allowing already do -- before Gorbachov\u2122s time already, they start allowing put up with and even in Yiddish or in Hebrew, what happened -- descriptions on these monuments, and they allowed to have Jews. I don\u2122t know if you know about that pol -- a Soviet write up of the name of Viefter Schenko, who wrote a poem about, \ufb01There\u2122s no monument in Babier,\ufb02 which is Kiev -- probably heard about it. And he wrote he\u2122s ashamed being a Russian, that th ey did not allow to put up m-monuments in these places, so they did allow, finally they did allow. And then, in the beg -- middle of this decade, since \u201a95, I think, Ukraine became independent and they allowed, already. And there was a fellow in our -- in -- in the -- in the province there, who, as a matter of fact, he\u2122s -- he -- he was the -- the -- the secretary of the Communist party in the -- in the -- yeah, he was half Jewish, too, but he didn\u2122t -- he said himself Ukrainian. And he USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 8 started putting up this monument with govern ment help, first Soviet and then the independent Ukraine. I got in touch with him, I found out there is in Israel a organization, it\u2122s called the House of Waleen. Waleen is the name of the province which has records of many. There\u2122s probably, in that part, hundred s of thousands of Jews perished. They didn\u2122t send them to -- to concentration camps, they killed them right then and there. In our town, it was exploded dump, oil dump that the Soviets built and they exploded it and then they used it for when they killed th-the German [indecipherable] they dump the Jews in there, you know. And this is the place -- so it was a military zone, belonged to the army. And you could not go into any place in army during Soviet days. They agreed they\u2122ll let us put up the monument. We -- We -- We a-agreed on a price with -- how much it\u2122ll cost. But it came the day when th ey\u2122re supposed -- already the monument is ready and they decided nyet, they\u2122re not allowed to on the mili-military. So, I -- finally it was ready, we are ready to go in 19 -- in 19 -- this was what, 60, now is 90 -- 98 and 96. 95, we had a date and I had a group, the -- a woman from the local -- well, W -- WMG -- GME, I think it is. That used to be WGAM. This is affiliate of CBS. No, wait a minute, was NBC. NBC, ABC, what\u2122s it, the other one?"

Reluctantly the station agreed to pay her expenses, she wanted to go very badly, but you couldn\u2122t go, because they said they wouldn\u2122t allow to -- later on I found out they did allow it, make a long story short, and we -- we scheduled a trip for the next year, 1960 -- 96, yeah. I had a group of about USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 9 12 people. There was myself, my wife and my daughter from Louisiana. The one from Israel couldn\u2122t make it, she couldn\u2122t get vaca tion at that time, which I hope by next year to take her and some of my grandchildren, [indecipherable]. And we f -- and two women, one -- both of them lived in New York, one now is in Boston and the other one works in New York, daughters of survivors. And then there was another son of survivors, whose father was a partisan with my brother. My brother and his wife and his three children, made a group of 12 people. And a friend of mine who lives in Warsaw came with us and Rochelle, of course. And we came -- we visite d Warsaw. We went to Povorsk, this town. We -- I have some pictures, I\u2122ll show you, of this. I also have a tape from that time, to all -- put this all in. We were met by the official s of the local government -- the head of the local council and by the officials, the hea -- the head of the -- deputy chairman of the regional council, which probably that\u2122s about 20 to 30 village -- like a county, approximately, here. Went with us with -- they -- we rented a bus and we stayed at a hotel, without cold water. My wife probably told you about the toilets [indecipherable] tell you. And we stayed there two days. We visited this town, we put up the monument. We made -- you know, dedicated -- dedicate d the monu -- the monument was standing already. It was -- had the description of Hebrew, Ukrainian and -- and English, not in Yiddish. And we started talking among our selves, my friend from Poland, this -- remarked it should be in Yiddish al so, even though nobody can understand, nobody can read it, we are here, you know, the few of us old ones to understand, will be gone soon. So we commissioned him, developer there, to put -- and we gave a few hundred more USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 10 dollars, to put up the -- I had my -- the inscription in Yiddish, I had prepared all the -- all of them, all the descriptions. So I gave him a copy of it and he sent me a photo that it\u2122s already there, it\u2122s put on. They also decided to -- we decided it needs a wider, more -- under the -- what do you call it?"

So we lied down, we think it\u2122ll be later on -- this was already what, six, seven o\u2122clock, have to have a nap, because it\u2122s so em-emotionally charged you know, and then -- and then the -- physically tired and exhausted.

We woke up eight o\u2122clock in the morning, without -- and dress [indecipherable]. That\u2122s how we -- tired we were.

His name was Reuben, her name was -- is Bella and the three kids was Ruth and Allen and -- and Audrey. And the two girls went to France, to have a good time, to Paris. And we went to Vilna with Rochelle, she told you about this trip, very, very emotional. So that \u2122s how we -- then we came back to Warsaw, because there\u2122s no direct flights from Vilna, or -- so they had to go through Warsaw and my -- my friend, who was -- who prepared dinner for us, it happened to be our anniversary. This was June 22nd. We went on the 17th, th-this was June 22nd, which is -- turned to -- our wedding anniversary, it\u2122s also the anniversary of the beginning of the war between Germany and Russia -- Soviet Union, 19 -- 1942. And from Vilna, we came back to Warsaw, stayed a couple of days. Warsaw, of course, is a beautiful city. I knew Warsaw from before the war. It looks ex actly the way it did look and -- and sa -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 13 improved. They have nice set of -- of cross the busy sections, you had underground shopping centers like, underground. And if you cross, you know Mashallkosco is the main street, you go under -- you cannot cross the street. And the -- the -- the traffic is unbelievable, it looked beautiful. And the situation, my sister-in-law told me Lodz was not as good. Warsaw\u2122s fine, but the -- the countryside is not -- not good. Economic situation not good. But through, of course we were interest -- we went -- I went to look at the ghetto and I had an uncle and an aunt and cousins living there. And there\u2122s nothing. Empty, but signs -- signs of streets that don\u2122t exist and signs of bunkers where the -- the Warsaw ghetto fighters came out or went into the sewers. Lamila, aiteen and some other places.

And then there was a flour mill, which is -- this -- it\u2122s not there. Nothing there now. Behind that, about 20 yards away, there\u2122s a whole new section built of new homes. And I have the suspicion they were built from the materials of these houses. They didn\u2122t want to live in these houses, you know, in case somebody claims them or what. E-Even though they thought everybody died anyway. But, it would better, you know, to pull them apart and build new houses. So, I have -- I will show you that picture. In the front there, in this picture, the front of the houses, there\u2122s military vehicles. I don\u2122t know was tanks or half tracks or something like that. And I don\u2122t -- maybe they are Polish or they are Soviet. It looked like it\u2122s a wide -- wide picture. It looked like sake -- taken by -- either by the military or by some other coun -- I don\u2122t know, it\u2122s -- it\u2122s not the amateur or a regular photographer picture. It looked like the scroll, it was rolled up into a storn, what it is fixed and I cou -- I recognized the houses. And we were standing there and nothing there. Th-The -- The whole -- The whole -- The whole trip was very emotional. We got on a train in Warsaw and I knew I -- many times I was traveling th is, from Warsaw to -- from -- not so from Warsaw, ulefell from Lodz, travel mi -- and I knew every station, I knew every town. And every one of them had Jewish people th ere. They -- Probably 70 - 80 - 90 percent, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 17 some of them were Jewish, the -- the peasants lived in the villages. Jews lived in the small towns, so called shtetla, see, and some bigger cities. In the city, you were -- Koven, where I went to school, which is not far from Povorsk, had a population of about 30,000 - 22 to 25,000 were Jewish. And this -- Now, it\u2122s a cit-city of 60,000, and there isn\u2122t a single Jew. And the city was completely destroyed in the war and rebuilt by the Soviets, you know, in these drab, long multi-story buildings, which fall a -- which started to fall apart the minute they were built, and they\u2122 re still -- so it wa -- this was very emotional. In time, you come to the station, I knew that station. The station was rebuilt exactly the way it was before the war. Looks -- This was a beautiful station and it still looks beautiful, til you come into it. You see there -- Rochelle had to go to the bathroom in the hole in the floor, she -- with a half partition in between the men and the women. Luckily, our daughter went in with her, so she could help her to get up. She has problem with her back. Otherwise, I know what would happen there. And there -- the -- the -- there\u2122s the bazaar, you can buy anything you want, there\u2122s no -- nothing in the store, there is no stores. One or two stores in the whole city. Used to be a lively, you know, commercial center, nothing. I don\u2122t know, there might be a few Jews. Somebody said there might be two or three Jews in town, but I -- I never -- the -- nobody came. None of the population came to this dedication, except the official s. And they make speeches about, you know, their former citizens and former, you know, su rvivors of the -- the -- and talking about peace and love among the nations and so forth and so on. I thanked them for putting up the monument, I thanked them for -- I -- I carri ed with me a oak seedling, grown from an USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 18 acorn in my backyard, right here. And when I opened it up, they couldn\u2122t -- I -- I wrapped it in soil, you know, potting -- like potting soil, that\u2122s wh -- potting soil, what they use, you know, for growing flowers, and they couldn\u2122t -- admired th-the -- the beauty of the soil, you know, such -- looks like rich, fertile soil, because they have sandy soil. Even the Ukraine has beautiful soil. And I planted it there and it is not growing so good, because I got a picture from it -- a friend of -- somebody, a friend of mine in Israel, knows a -- non-Jewish, who used to be a neighbor of ours, and they took a picture. And my brother sends them a check every so ofte n and this fellow there sent them packages. So they take care of it. The head of the local council promised that he\u2122ll assign a high school class to take care of it. So, every year I send them a hundred dollars, which is there a fortune. And he wouldn\u2122t answer me, so I -- last year I cal -- finally got his telephone number. I couldn\u2122t reach him at his pla -- place o -- office. So I got from somebody else in his home, I call him, oh, he was very happy that -- but he didn\u2122t write [indecipherable] he -- maybe he doesn\u2122t know how to write, I don\u2122t know. But he said oh, they are taking care of it. I don\u2122t see what they do there, but I can see there\u2122s a -- kind of to protect it, like a little cage. But it didn\u2122t grow. The soil is not so good, least probably some fertilizer. We\u2122ll be there next year, be -- I hope. I hope, but with me, it was -- I -- th -- th -- this is my -- if I ever accomplished anything in my life, this would be at the -- at the top of it. Most important thing I did. I feel I did something my -- they will approve -- would have approved -- th-th-the victims. So, there are some others aware of that and want to hear about it. Some contributed to it.

Vilna -- I don\u2122t know if she told you, Vilna was the culture capital -- the -- the cul -- the Jewish -- Jewish culture. This was the only place where there was teacher seminars for Hebrew teachers, Yiddish teachers and Polish Yiddish teachers for Vilna -- for high schools. It had a beautiful library called a streshun library.

Still named so, but there\u2122s no gowan, and no -- the cemetery where her mother was buried is not there, there\u2122s a park there now. But they\u2122re building in this place at -- some -- some broken monuments and they\u2122re trying to build a little monument composed of all these -- that -- the pieces that they found.

And ar -- and all the center was occupied by Jewish homes. A little out further, there were peasants, Ukrainian peasants, who had their parcels of land on them, and they were now basically agricultural people, you know, they grew -- grew stuff. The Jews in this town were all artisans. Blacksmiths, carpenters, who built furniture and houses and all kinds of carpentry. Tailors, who work for the local non-Jewish population mostly, but they were the majority. They used to go to villages where -- for six months, to build a house or to sew clothes for a couple who got married, you know, stayed there. They were all very pious. Used to go, when they were in town, they used to go three times a day to the synagogue. Lately, not so much. Most of them had grown beards, the majority, except after the s-second World War, there were some that did shave their -- their faces. They were strong believers in a rab -- Hasidic rabe, which exists now in New York. It was called a stollena chasidim. It was a typical, what we called -- we lived in the next town, it was only 12 kilometers away, the same kind of people, we called them backward, cause they were very observant. But there was no railroad sta -- the railroad station was six kilometers away. So you had to, if you\u2122re goi ng to go by tra -- by train, you had to walk to the railroad station or take a horse and wagon. I -- And this was the kind of -- and there was ha -- at least half of the -- half of the town were Kirzners, my mother\u2122s maiden name.

I had two grandmot her that -- wa -- one died a natural death USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 25 many years ago and the other one I told you, was found, was running away with two grandchildren. I had the cousins by the dozens. This was the kind of a town it was. In th -- As I told you before, we -- we -- I lived in a town that was new. This one had a tradition way back, it was for generations -- during the war, the first World War, it was occupied by the Germans and they evacuated us. I was born during the first World War and we were evacuated into the hinterland -- German , by Austro-Hungarians, which operated this sector of the front. I remember mother used to tell me I was probably s-six months old, it was January, I was born in July. So, I was about five, six months old and they evacuate us in -- in cattle cars. Later Hitler used this for -- for sending -- but it was not -- these were not evacuated for -- to -- to -- to die, they were evacu -- to -- to save their lives, s-so they can move the front, you know, they we -- without hindrance by [indecipherable] civilian population. And when I ca -- When you came to the destination, which was only about 50 to 60 miles away, I was half frozen. So the Hungarian soldiers who operated that sector of the front, threw me -- they stood -- to -- stood in a line and threw me from hand to hand til they revived me. Later in, the same Hungarians sent Jews to Auschwitz. See the difference? That\u2122s why a lot of people did not escape, because we knew the Germans from the first World War. My father spoke Germans perfe -- German perfectly, and he worked for the Germans the first World War, as an interpreter. And who would expect that the most civilized country in Europe -- nobody believed -- just the Germans who didn\u2122t believe it -- that last long, so that we, who lived under the Germans in the first World War, we were waiting for them. Because the Czarist -- th-the -- the enemy was the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 26 Czarist army, the Cossacks. See, there was no Jewish officers in the -- in the Czarist army, but there were Jewish officers in the German army. Or in the Hungarian -- Hungaria -- the Austro-Hungarian army. So nobody expected it. A lot of them could have been saved, a lot of them could have been evacuated. My parents could have. But how do you leave? You have a home, you have a cow, you have a -- a barn, you have -- you know, everything there. Not -- Not much, but a place to live."

There was no work, there wa -- we had to find the enemy and who the enemy was, w ho knows? The Poles were course, hated -- hated us. We didn\u2122t see any future for ourselves as Jews -- y-young -- Jewish youngsters. So we -- first of all, I wer -- I was probably 14 -15, is I joined the group Socialist Zionists, the Shamara Zaheer and then the -- they\u2122re the one that pioneered in Israel, in the kibbutzim, way to the left. The atheist Socialist Nationalist Jews. Then the -- I -- I didn\u2122t like this kind of Socialism, so I became a Rightist youngster, you know for the -- was -- with -- they called it that time, the Revisionist Zionist again, Zionist again. And I was disappointed then and because it was somewhat semi-Fascist, the -- the uniforms were brown like -- like German SS. That what -- they had it before the German SS, you know, but I mean, there was fights between th e left and the right and I was basically Zionist, but not -- I -- I don\u2122t know what the solution would be, to -- I -- a Jewish USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 32 homeland and Palestine or not the Jewish homeland and Palestine. So if you\u2122re born here, we should have the rights here. So I joined the group, which was anti-Fascist. Little did I know the anti-Fascist group was a -- the poli -- this Communist party was illegal in Poland. This was a way for them to -- from within, to come into the -- some kind of legal way and this was the anti-Fascist, they preached Socialist unity among the Je -- Je-Jewish Socialist parties -- so cal -- so called progressive, Polish so called progressive and they f-formed this, but later on I realized this was a Communist front. So I quit this party. But I -- I loved the Hebrew language, you know, I -- I was educated in it and the Communist forbid -- forbade Zionism and the language -- not just Zionism, but the language. Yiddish was the language. I says, \ufb01Why can\u2122t we have two languages? It\u2122s a language that we -- you know, it\u2122s -- is a l -- you know, come -- is already several thousand years in our history, why should we abandon? It\u2122s a beautiful language, I like it.\ufb02 So, I could not fit in into a frame. I could not fi -- I -- I couldn\u2122t be a Communist. I was a Zionist -- a partial Zionist. I had my own ideas. The same with re ligion, I was not -- I could not conform to the official religion. I had atheistic or agnostic -- I don\u2122t know -- feelings, see? But like -- like many others, I didn\u2122t know what -- I couldn\u2122t make -- I -- I -- til this day I don\u2122t know what I want, and I\u2122m sure that many other people don\u2122t either. Then came the Communists, in 1939. Even though what I di dn\u2122t know what\u2122s going on in the Soviet Union, I saw right away something is wrong ther e. First of all, they arrested Communists, who was -- one jail -- spent in jail, idealists, people idealist with -- spent in Polish jail five, 10 years, for nothing. For raising a red flag, for speaking out against the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 33 government, they were sent away. Th-They\u2122d sa y -- when they came in, the ri -- the first victims were these people, they sent them away. I got a -- I -- I worked -- during the beginning, I tried to organize a school that will t-teach Yiddish, because since we didn\u2122t have enough population to -- to introduce the Yiddish language, Yiddish history, Jewish history, into the curriculum [indecipherable] my 20\u2122s, [indecipherable] are married, a-aand -- and then to the Ukrainian school, because the -- the majority were the Ukrainian, and they rebuffed me. It all -- It all -- They almost accused me of being Nationalist and this was a big -- oh, either Nationalist or Cosmopolitan, both of them were non-kosher. So I gave up, I couldn\u2122t do anything. I got a job, because I was doing a good job for th -- I was -- you know, I ha -- I worked with the -- at that time there were Yiddish papers that came from Kiev and in the beginning were th e honeymoon. So, the local pol -- di -- g-gagave me the job of managing the local store. Th ere wasn\u2122t much in it, but whatever was, I was the first one that I could use for myself, see? And my family. And my father got the job because he spoke Russian perfectly. I didn\u2122t speak Russian, but I -- I knew Ukrainian. Never learned it, but from the -- we lived am ong the Ukrainians, I knew Ukrainian. Then, the war started and I left. I was in the army and when I came there, they -- they -- because -- I -- I -- I -- I fell into -- it\u2122s a long story, I don\u2122t -- not trying to tell the whole thing. I was in -- in -- in German encirclement and I risked my life to get out of there and they took and they put me on the front and then th ey took me off the front, because I was -- I am unreliable, because I was -- lived in Poland before \u201a39. Thousands and thousands and thousands of people, they took out the front. They didn\u2122t take off local Ukrainians, who USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 34 deserted every day from the place where I was. I did not desert, because I know desertion mean death. Th-The Germans capture me, that\u2122s -- that\u2122s it, it\u2122ll be the end. So -- and then they put me on -- on the build-building a railroa d. It\u2122s already the second year of the war and -- near Stalingrad, on the other side of the Volga, because there was none there to put on this side -- on the east -- west side -- you never know which [indecipherable] it was. And we build this railroad and it was built by the NKVD. This is the -- the secret police, th-the -- the prison authorities. And they took us as work battalions -- military work battalions, and treated just like the -- these con -- co -- con -- convicts, see? And these were also mostly for political crimes. Those who had a lot of si -- land, you know, the Kulaks and so forth. Some were there for next to nothing. They stole something from the place of work. Five years, 10 years, 15 years, you know, Stalin -- Stalin\u2122s pogrom. Then I realized -- I saw the -- th-the real face of Communism, because I remember them and I wo-work in the coal mine and I figured if I only knew -- if Stalin only knew -- see how blind I was -- what -- what they do to us. Little did I know this was Stalin\u2122s orders. And we build a railroad before we went in the mine, there used to be a -- a NKVD official by the name of Brienin. Brienin I know was a He brew writer and I think it must be the same family, it\u2122s not -- it\u2122s very unusual name. Because I met a girl in Portland here, she\u2122s not a local. And when I told her that I remember from the Hebrew literature, we studied -- a fellow by the name Reuben Brienin, she said that\u2122s -- was her uncle. She lived in -- I don\u2122t know, Pennsylvania or somewhere. She kne w who it was. He stayed in the Soviet Union and this must be a -- from this same family and he was wearing elegant white shirt USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 35 -- clean, white shirt and shiny boots, with military, navy pants and he used to walk -- see - - and now we had to -- it was in the Steppests, you know, the flat land. We had to dig the soil out and we had to do so many cubic meters. An-And -- And we -- with -- and wheelbarrows, all by hand, without any ma chinery, go up, you know, like second floor high to put the trestle -- on the trestle and then somebody will stand there -- not one, in the hundreds, and -- and the temperature, it\u2122ll be hard so we can put the rails on it. And he used to come and go with this -- check out this. And he was -- he looked very well fed a-and we were -- we were -- if you did the norm, that\u2122s a five cubic yards of soil, you get a certain soup. There were three kinds of soup. Was millet -- millet, it\u2122s -- was thicker or thinner. Some was from water, all the way, you know to a little thick se -- or more bread. An-And it was like a vicious circle, if you couldn\u2122t make your norm, you got less to eat. You had less to eat, you had less strength to -- to -- to do any. So you were doomed. Luckily, this -- after four months, th-th-this was finished and I survived it. I went from -- probably from 150 pounds to about 100 pounds in -- in no time. Then I realized the real - what the real Soviet order is, what Communism is. But I was supported before and I was happy because in the beginning, you know, there were Jews in high -- high officials. Not too many too high. There was one Awon Ka kanovich that survived, it was -- he was Stalin\u2122s brother-in-law, a Jew. The rest of them were killed afterward. Especially 1948, but I was out at that time. But it -- it was a great letdown."

            "answer": "Oh yeah, I did relate to [indecipherable] more so -- more so, because this was a thousand percent improvement on what we had. I never lived in a free country. I came and I got a job in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. And Woonsocket Rhode Island\u2122s a small town and I saw -- I -- I already started reading -- knew enough English to read a paper. And I saw in the paper -- this was Hanukah holiday. And in the local paper, there an article about Hanukah. The -- With a picture of a Menorah. The Hebrew school and so -- I couldn\u2122t understand it, see? To me, this was -- no -- no American paid -- paid attention to it, it\u2122s -- it\u2122s normal, right? To me, it was not normal, it was -- it made me idealize America, even though there were many things later on I found out that I knew it was not so great. But compared to what we had, this was paradise. I made my first wages, a dollar five an hour, union wages, that\u2122s a help on a truck. I was a Hebrew teacher, the gets -- first I got a job as a Hebrew teacher. This was 1948, there was some -- a lot of unemployment. Truman was just elected a nd they -- they thought the country\u2122s go-going on to the dogs, economically, see? It was very difficult. So I stayed -- it was in Boston. So when I came, they gave me a job in a Hebrew school. They knew I knew Hebrew. Some of my relatives -- relative\u2122s relatives in Chelsea, in Massachusetts and I came there. I did not -- my English was zero. And their He brew was zero -- and they gave me first a fifth grade with their teacher supervising me. Well, I didn\u2122t do badly because they understood some Hebrew. I have a natural knack of teaching, even though I have no USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 37 academic preparation for it. But I -- I could convey, you know, whatever I know to others. And I did all right, he says, \ufb01You have promise.\ufb02 So then, there was -- th-the-then the school year ended and there was a teacher, a young lady in the first grade and her contract called for the school year, she quit. They decided to keep the school open another two months -- do -- two weeks or three weeks, I don\u2122t remember what. The parents, they are paying tuition for the year, they wanted to have -- you know, let them have the kids another two years in scho -- two weeks in school, not to be at their backs. Was a small, poor town, Chelsea. So, they gave me this first grade. I am by myself with a classroom about 30 kids, don\u2122t understand a word of Hebrew. They can\u2122t read already, hardly and I don\u2122t understand a word of Eng -- they smelled a rat right away and this was the worst time of my life. So, anyway, wi -- it lasted only a couple of weeks and the principal said, \ufb01Maybe start the new year, I\u2122ll send for you.\ufb02 Meantime I went to Woonsocket, I got this job in the -- dollar five an hour, union wages. Hebrew school used to pay 75 dollars a week for about three hours a day, few days a week, which was great. And the -- also, he ga -- they send me to the -- Boston has it -- used to have a Hebrew teacher\u2122s college. Now it\u2122s called the Hebrew college, which awards degrees, you know, the undergraduate and -- and the masters. They wa nted to accept me in the third year -- it was a four year school, third year, nights. And I -- when I thought -- w-we\u2122re -- with the kids -- September came, he sent for me, he wanted me to come and I said, \ufb01Nothing doing, I don\u2122t want it, it\u2122s enough.\ufb02 So, I -- I went to -- later on, I lost the job. So, over the summer, I came back to Boston, I got anothe r job and there I went to Hebrew college USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 38 and they told me they\u2122ll let me into a third -- I -- I had to take a-an exam in a few -- I -- a few subjects I did not know. Talmud, I think it was and some other -- Hebrew, I -- the lalanguage and I didn\u2122t have problems. But I didn\u2122t decide -- but I had a cousin -- my cousin\u2122s wife, who\u2122s to me like a sister and that -- she died already, and she says, \ufb01Working in this place is not for you.\ufb02 It was a [indecipherable], I was a foreman there. It was 20 women. It was not easy either, but I managed. They pay me -- what -- came from 42 dollars a week union wages, I got 32 dollars as a supervisor, you know. Foreman, 32 dollars a week. The girl that worked there made -- the -- the -- the minimum wage went up to 75 cents an hour. Was 30 dol -- they -- they made more -- more than I did, almost. So, she says, \ufb01You have to go to school, you have to learn. So it\u2122s either Hebrew college, or --\ufb02 she sa -- I says, \ufb01My father was an accountant, self taught.\ufb02 He is got some correspondence course. So I knew a little bit about bookkeeping. So I went to Bentley\u2122s -- Bentley College, which is now a big school. At that [indecipherable], it was a little -- little school in Boylston Street and I took accounting. So, I worked for three -- three years in Boston, then we got married -- I got marri ed, had a daughter, we came to Portland. So -- What were they talking about -- we talked abou-about something else, we were talking about America, America. I -- America I thought, to me -- to me it was the greatest country in the world. So, of course, I knew the Soviet Union, I knew it already. I kn -- I -- it was an evil empire, no question about it. I couldn\u2122t see how can American defend the system they don\u2122t know -- think about, which a lot of American did. There are many bad things, you know, the Nixon and this and -- McCarthy. But these were things that did not USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 39 apply to me. I knew I can go anyplace -- I knew -- none -- it wasn\u2122t easy at that time, either, Brandeis was built, because it was hard for Jewish student to go to college, they had a -- they had the certain number they woul d accept. But they were a certain number, not zero. Poland it was, well, not zero. Point point something, see? And we were 10 percent the population in Poland. And then the Soviet Union, so this, to me, is ideal, to -- I didn\u2122t miss an election. I took my Americanism very, very seriously."

Last year, I did my -- my tax re -- did theirs by hand, an-and a friend of mine who had a computer did mine on computer. An-And it was a -- came out exactly -- so, I ga -- I do th -- there\u2122s also my -- my sister-in-law\u2122s aunt, who died a few months ago, and I did hers. And his daughter, ma -- my niece, has a computer. She -- She\u2122s a lawyer now, as a matter of fact, she works -- she has a job, she didn\u2122t want this, you know, rat race law profession, you work 24 hours a day, [indecipherable]. She wants a job where she can take her time, she can wo rk out, you know, she\u2122s -- she\u2122s single, she\u2122s in her 30\u2122s, and she wants to enjoy life, and go on vacation. So, she got a job now with -- she jus -- she graduated -- you know, she -- for a few years she worked and then she went to law school, after college. So she just got -- a few years ago, she got her Maine -- New Hampshire, sh -- well, she clerked for a co -- for a judge in New Hampshire. So she got the New Hampshire -- she passed the New Hampshire Bar, Maine Bar and Massachusetts Bar. And she works now for a investment firm, Fidelity -- Fidelity Investment, you know, it\u2122s one of the largest in the world and she worked there, you know, in the law department. She was -- it was legal [indeciphe rable] legal. So she -- when I got the program, the program like this, cost me about 30 dollars. I -- I was -- I -- I was the first USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 73 accountant in Maine to use a -- to use a computer for tax returns, 30 years ago. I paid for a computer, 25,000 dollars. Now you buy it for 2,000. Besides the 25,000, I had to pay 5,000 for maintenance of the software, changi ng the tax -- enhancing the programs and so on. And five for the hardware. Something goe s wrong, which it went a lot, now it -- now it\u2122s already no problem, but it was as big as -- twice the size of this table. And it made a noise like it was, you know, it had a -- the first printer was like the ball printer, the IBM typewriters had. Now, of course, you buy a computer for -- for 2,000 dollars, it has everything. And you buy a program, a tax pr ogram, which has 29 states beside the federal, for 30 dollars. And you don\u2122t even need forms, they -- it prints on plain paper. Rochelle used to come and to help me, she used to collate the forms and they were with -- with carbon. You\u2122d get -- all of a sudden, you start mixing up, you know, [indecipherable] paper over the carbon, or the printout are wrong. So, anyway, she -- so, sh-she took her -- her aunts, you know, my -- my sister-in-law\u2122s aunt, she put her through -- from my handwritten, and put it through their computer. So I told them I\u2122ll get a computer myself, you know, not just [indeci pherable] don\u2122t do much, just my family. Says I -- I\u2122ll get a computer and so, this coming year, I will print you out a computer on my computer, you won\u2122t have to -- so, he sends me a check for 3,000 dollars, to -- to pay for the computer. I said, \ufb01What do you have? I -- I don\u2122t want you to pay for my com --\ufb02 We-Well, she died, the son died, she says, she would want you to have some of her money. I says, \ufb01I don\u2122t think it\u2122s [indecipherable] to leave it for your children.\ufb02 So I -- I couldn\u2122t -- couldn\u2122t help it, so I took the check, you know, I -- but I didn\u2122t deposit it. I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 74 came home, I tore out the signature and I have it to keep. He calls me up, \ufb01I got my statement, didn\u2122t get my check,\ufb02 he says. \ufb01I\u2122m going to write you a letter, the minute I can learn how to type.\ufb02 I\u2122m teaching my computer to read my dic -- you know, type my dictation, cause I -- I don\u2122t -- I type [indecipherable] finger here. It\u2122s very, very slow. I -- I use it for e-mail, you know, I still type. But I have to wait. Wh-When we go to Florida, we\u2122ll have time to train the computer to r ecognize my voice and -- and type. So I have a difficult time with he -- with him. He\u2122s very generous. And he -- I can -- I cannot fight with him. [indecipherable] is not a fighter, ac tually, but -- so I -- I have to write him a letter. Explain to him I don\u2122t want any -- any money matters between us. W-We are very devoted to each other as we -- we -- we -- as much as we see -- we can see each other. We have problem [indecipherable] so -- so , when he comes here, because Rochelle makes -- usually she makes dinner and sometim es when we go out of course, I have a good excuse. You are my guest, so I pay. But he come there [indecipherable], he was in Florida and came to us for a week the first time, because her aunt used to be sick, she too-took care of her mo -- better than a daughter. Was very, very sick, she wa -- survived Auschwitz and Rochelle -- that\u2122s how Rochelle met her. She went to see a friend of hers in the hospital and she met her own -- my -- my sister-in-law\u2122s aunt. We became friends. So you can imagine, after the war, she was so sick that they carried her. She weighed about 50 pounds. Nobody expected she survived. But she survived, she married, couldn\u2122t have any children. And he died, she\u2122s -- was my age. She just died a few months ago. So, we are getting along fine. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 75"

And I learned it since I was three years old, I knew it. I always had a kind of a -- I don\u2122t know how to describe my relationship USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 77 with religion. It\u2122s -- It\u2122s -- Rochelle has a hate - love, mostly hate. We -- We have problem when I discuss it with her, I say, \ufb01A ll right, G-God, if he did do the Holocaust, you know, if G-God did the Holocaust, all right, I can understand your hating him. But at the same time, you agree that He exists. He or She or whatever It is. Because you cannot be -- be mad at something that doesn\u2122t exist, can you?\ufb02 I partic -- I -- I was active here in every facet of Jewish life in Portland except religious institutions. I belonged to a Temple, but I was several times elected to the board, I did not accept it. I did not -- I was of the opinion, if you are a leader in a religious organization, you have to at least have set some example of -- of religious practice. A nd I could not do that. I consider religion -- Jewish religion as part of Jewish culture. It is in our past. Is there a God or isn\u2122t a God? I cannot determine. I -- I think by my philosophy, I\u2122m agnostic. But I cannot deny -- that means I cannot deny there isn\u2122t one, nor can ther e is one. But, the-these tr -- the trappings of religion do exist in our culture. This ha -- This is part of our inheritance. We do go on high holidays. I go, when I have chance, practically every Saturday here, when I\u2122m in Portland. And in Florida, there is a big synagogue and you don\u2122t just -- there -- you\u2122re not welcome, as a -- as a snowbird, w-we are snowbirds. That\u2122s people that stay for the season. They accept membership, you know, for a low fee. Membership are very high there, but for a low fee, for the few mont hs you are there, but they -- you never get -- you-you\u2122re a second class member. So we -- I don\u2122t -- didn\u2122t join. Once in awhile we go, they had cultural events in the synagogue, shows and concerts, we go there. But that\u2122s about it. Again, to put it in a nutshell, religion is part of our inheritance. I don\u2122t think we USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 78 are ready to give it up yet. The idea would be, if there was one religion, one world religion, where they recognize one force, call it God, call it whatever you want to, a non-sectarian. Will it ever be? I don\u2122t know. The Soviet Union tried to suppress religion for 70 years and they did not succeed. It is strong, it\u2122s alive and people need it in their lives. I never prayed. If I do pray, I pray for national or global salvation. Peace. Very important to me. Never -- I never prayed God for myself, help me get a good job, or -- I don\u2122t think this power, which we call God, is designed for individual concern. I envy people that can have a personal religion. This is my God, I pray, you know, and He answers me. If they have it, more power to them. I cannot do that. I see, when I did the prayers, you know, that we say on the high holidays, it\u2122s poetry. The adulation of a power which we call God, see? I can\u2122t understand why do we have to bless God? This a power -- a omnipotent power that blesses us, right? So what -- what does my little blessing -- you know, we say a blessing, in Jewish life, there are lots of blessings, you know, that -- that 613, it\u2122s what? Commandments. We have -- whatever you do, you make a blessing. Blessed are thou, you know [indecipherable] brought forth from th e soil. But you have to bring it yourself from the soil. Gives you th-the -- the tools of doi ng it, see? So, i-if it\u2122s a blessing, I have to ask for a blessing. So I don\u2122t think I\u2122m mo re important a creature, as a ment, or any other creature. So, I have -- I -- I think I\u2122m in that class by myself. I don\u2122t think anybody has the same -- everybody has his own -- his own belief, his own bi -- philosophy. I don\u2122t think -- I\u2122m sure that others have their own, other kinds of philosophies or -- or beliefs, or whatever and they think that theirs is right. But I -- I would like to see if there\u2122s a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 79 relationship -- if there has -- a religion has to exist, let there be one. We -- We consider ourselves the chosen people. Of course, they say we -- we were chosen to teach other peoples, but we taught enough -- yeah, we can taught enough. We -- Everybody knows the Christian Right knows the Bible backward and forward, you know, and they use it just for their needs, just what they want. They, you know, they quote. But the other thing, the good things are there, which they do not. So, until -- now, you see, you take the Muslim world. Religion is upswing in the Muslim, Jewish and Christian. The same even with India, which was a very tolerant -- you know, the Hindu, mostly Hindu, we\u2122ll talk about the -- what do you call it? Eastern religions --"

Telephone, which I don\u2122t understand eve -- still, how it works, see -- was invented by the time why I was born. I am operating a computer and I can get into a network which has -- I\u2122m tr ying to find one -- one subject, Yiddish, a language of a people which is gone, almost a dead language. It\u2122s trying to be revived by non-Jews studying it. And -- And there\u2122s 590 pages on the computer about Yiddish. There\u2122s thousands of thousands and thousands of pages about science an-and then things USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 81 which in my little laptop -- so, I am a product of a -- probably that covered a civilization which did not change from the fifte -- 1500\u2122s to the 2,000\u2122s.

I used to go from -- with the wagon of bu -- a horse and buggy from Povorsk, from my -- the town where th ey lived, to Koven, to buy merchandise, which is three -- 33 kilometers.

So, and -- and I still cannot digest it, I cannot understand it. And I find that the -- the human race is way ahea d in it\u2122s technology, but way behind in it\u2122s conception of life, all together. I think, if you made this much progress, i-if you could have made this much progress in -- in our lifes with each other, the people\u2122s, countries, the systems, religions, if you could find a way to regulate our lifes to the same measuring stick as the technology went, we should be wonderful and be -- be able to get along fine. And it\u2122s getting worse. That\u2122s what bothers me. I am worried that my grandchildren will run out of food by the time they\u2122re grown up. And I know what it means being hungry. I wouldn\u2122t wish it on anybody. An-And the same time, you think -- yo-you don\u2122t see them, so you don\u2122t think of them, but the way I do think of it.
