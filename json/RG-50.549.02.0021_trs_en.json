You -- you didn\u2019t know who you were talking to, whether it was a- a Nazi who -- who was trying to kill you before and who 1s now trying to -- to save his own hide or -- or whether it was somebody who just came off the ship, by accident. Anyway, it was very -- a long time ago, so I can\u2019t remember. Then it was difficult to get - get where you wanted to go, because that -- the French and the Belgians, I think and the Poles sent their -- their people to -- to collect their own people, because there -- they were notified. But anybody behind the Iron Curtain, like -- like Hungarians and Czechs and -- nobody cared really, but there was a United Nations relief organization, you -- the UNRRA, Unrah, and I had a chance to -- actually, I -- I found somewhere -- I organized myself a -- a violin and through -- through -- through the British, I became a -- a violinist for the officer\u2019s club. I didn\u2019t know much -- too many British officer songs anyway, but I- I survived somehow and I played a little bit. Of course, it was difficult because -- I spoke a little English, but not -- now, my English is better, my acc-accent is the same. But I had to make myself understood. And s-si -- one of the officers helped me to get notification to the Red Cross, because I had an uncle in Ankara who survived the war in - in Turkey. And I knew his address. I didn\u2019t have a chance to send anything to Budapest,  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But through the Red Cross, I -- I sent a note to my uncle, who then notified my parents that I was alive. So it took four months until I -- I finally got back to Hungary -- to Budapest. Mayas -- with a Czech transport. There was nothing going on for -- for Hungarians. But I -- I joined at that Czech transport and I got back somehow. On buses, on trains, on -- had no money, of course. And then I went to -- to my old apartment, not knowing whether my mother is around, or my father. That\u2019s where they -- they deported me from, originally. And so they were alive. And then I became concertmaster of the -- of the Budapest Concert Orchestra. They knew it through my mother that I was alive and they were waiting for me, as a -- with -- with that position. And those were the first few months, everything was very difficult. There was inflation, there was no -- no food, no money, no nothing. Basically, it was terrible times. And it was basically Russian occupation. So, we went through all kinds of horror stories. But I played. I practice, I played and I got back into the swing of things and then I left. Some of us felt that the -- the world is open, now that the war is over, the world is open for -- for -- for us talented, good, good instrumentalists, et- etcetera. And we went over to Austria and then to France and we ha -- we s -- we had a -- with some colleagues, I played in a string quartet and nothing really j-jived. Because the world wasn\u2019t open. In France, you couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t get a job if you didn\u2019t have nationality -- I mean, didn\u2019t belong to -- even -- even as a -- as a foreigner, if you didn\u2019t have the right kind of papers, you couldn\u2019t get a job.

They were looking for a concertmaster in Budapest and I got the job. I was the youngest concertmaster they ever had in the Budapest Philharmonic. Twas like -- like in Vienna, the Philharmonic and the opera orchestra is the same -- or was the same. And I was there for -- for a season, two seasons and somebody who knew me from way back, when I was a student -- this lady was a pianist and she survived the war in -- in- in Sweden. And she recommended me for concertmaster to come to Gurterburg, in Sweden. So I got the passport, I didn\u2019t promise them anything, but I went out to -- to play the audition. And after I played out the -- the audition and I was -- I got the job, then I went back to Budapest -- oh, I went back and I got a year of -- va -- leave of absence -- a leave, yeah. And then I never went back, afterwards. I didn\u2019t go back, I went out to Sweden and I was concertmaster in Gurterburg for three years. Then there was an opening in Berlin and they wanted me to come. I played an audition again. I got the job and that\u2019s when I started in the opera house. This Shtetisher oper, meaning civic opera, but that was one of the big operas. They had three in -- in Berlin -- 1n West Berlin and in East Berlin, there were three or four opera houses, but three of -- three of them were famous. The Startsh oper and the Commisher oper was -- were in East Berlin. My opera, the Shtetisher oper was West Berlin. And I never went over to the east side, because I wasn\u2019t interested in it. I knew -- knew what Communism is and I knew what Russian occupation is, I wasn\u2019t interested. But that was an interesting life. West Berlin was -- was an island in -- in -- in Germany.

But by then it was a little better, where I was concertmaster in the opera house, but we still didn\u2019t have peace. Not just peace, but bombed out buildings and -- and bombed out apartments and -- and very little -- very little food. The Russians took as much as was movable, they took. They- they dismantled toilets in the hotels and -- and washing -- wash basins and took them, because most of these -- these so-called soldiers, they have never seen anything that rem - rem -- that is close to co-comfort and that is close to luxury. So they -- they got -- they went wild. They took the watches off -- off your arm and they had -- some of them had five, six watches on their arms. Duvi, duvi, that was the -- the word. Give, give, whatever you can. And they took the rings off the fingers of the people and -- and the watches and it was a very strange world, but you know, it just comes to me sporadically, when I talk about it.
