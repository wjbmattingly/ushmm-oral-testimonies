We went -- we were in Russia and then we went to Hungary and -- and Vienna, to play a concert each. It ba -- it brought back memories, but for some reason, I wasn\u2019t too upset about what happened. But as concertmaster of the Berlin opera house since -- I mean from -- for \u201850 -- f -- \u201850 til \u201854. I took this as a rehabilitation -- kind of restitution, because I made it -- I play in a proba -- a -- a -- an audition and I ma -- got the job and I lived there for three years, almost four. And I made some very good friends. Not -- not all of them were -- were -- were avid Nazis.

And then we -- we had nothing. Basically zero. What we had on was wet and that -- that was what -- what we owned, the few people who -- who survived.

            "num": 24,
            "question": "In what way\u201d?",
            "answer": "In very many ways. You -- you didn\u2019t know who you were talking to, whether it was a- a Nazi who -- who was trying to kill you before and who 1s now trying to -- to save his own hide or -- or whether it was somebody who just came off the ship, by accident. Anyway, it was very -- a long time ago, so I can\u2019t remember. Then it was difficult to get - get where you wanted to go, because that -- the French and the Belgians, I think and the Poles sent their -- their people to -- to collect their own people, because there -- they were notified. But anybody behind the Iron Curtain, like -- like Hungarians and Czechs and -- nobody cared really, but there was a United Nations relief organization, you -- the UNRRA, Unrah, and I had a chance to -- actually, I -- I found somewhere -- I organized myself a -- a violin and through -- through -- through the British, I became a -- a violinist for the officer\u2019s club. I didn\u2019t know much -- too many British officer songs anyway, but I- I survived somehow and I played a little bit. Of course, it was difficult because -- I spoke a little English, but not -- now, my English is better, my acc-accent is the same. But I had to make myself understood. And s-si -- one of the officers helped me to get notification to the Red Cross, because I had an uncle in Ankara who survived the war in - in Turkey. And I knew his address. I didn\u2019t have a chance to send anything to Budapest, because I -- I didn\u2019t know whether my parents were alive or not, first of all and secondly there was no c-communication or -- or mail or anything like that. But through the Red Cross, I -- I sent a note to my uncle, who then notified my parents that I was alive. So it took four months until I -- I finally got back to Hungary -- to Budapest. Mayas -- with a Czech transport. There was nothing going on for -- for Hungarians. But I -- I joined at that Czech transport and I got back somehow. On buses, on trains, on -- had no money, of course. And then I went to -- to my old apartment, not knowing whether my mother is around, or my father. That\u2019s where they -- they deported me from, originally. And so they were alive. And then I became concertmaster of the -- of the Budapest Concert Orchestra. They knew it through my mother that I was alive and they were waiting for me, as a -- with -- with that position. And those were the first few months, everything was very difficult. There was inflation, there was no -- no food, no money, no nothing. Basically, it was terrible times. And it was basically Russian occupation. So, we went through all kinds of horror stories. But I played. I practice, I played and I got back into the swing of things and then I left. Some of us felt that the -- the world is open, now that the war is over, the world is open for -- for -- for us talented, good, good instrumentalists, et- etcetera. And we went over to Austria and then to France and we ha -- we s -- we had a -- with some colleagues, I played in a string quartet and nothing really j-jived. Because the world wasn\u2019t open. In France, you couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t get a job if you didn\u2019t have nationality -- I mean, didn\u2019t belong to -- even -- even as a -- as a foreigner, if you didn\u2019t have the right kind of papers, you couldn\u2019t get a job. So when I went back, I played an audition for the opera. They were looking for a concertmaster in Budapest and I got the job. I was the youngest concertmaster they ever had in the Budapest Philharmonic. Twas like -- like in Vienna, the Philharmonic and the opera orchestra is the same -- or was the same. And I was there for -- for a season, two seasons and somebody who knew me from way back, when I was a student -- this lady was a pianist and she survived the war in -- in- in Sweden. And she recommended me for concertmaster to come to Gurterburg, in Sweden. So I got the passport, I didn\u2019t promise them anything, but I went out to -- to play the audition. And after I played out the -- the audition and I was -- I got the job, then I went back to Budapest -- oh, I went back and I got a year of -- va -- leave of absence -- a leave, yeah. And then I never went back, afterwards. I didn\u2019t go back, I went out to Sweden and I was concertmaster in Gurterburg for three years. Then there was an opening in Berlin and they wanted me to come. I played an audition again. I got the job and that\u2019s when I started in the opera house. This Shtetisher oper, meaning civic opera, but that was one of the big operas. They had three in -- in Berlin -- 1n West Berlin and in East Berlin, there were three or four opera houses, but three of -- three of them were famous. The Startsh oper and the Commisher oper was -- were in East Berlin. My opera, the Shtetisher oper was West Berlin. And I never went over to the east side, because I wasn\u2019t interested in it. I knew -- knew what Communism is and I knew what Russian occupation is, I wasn\u2019t interested. But that was an interesting life. West Berlin was -- was an island in -- in -- in Germany. And that was very good, until I got my American pa -- visa, which took eight -- eight years I was waiting for the American visa. And when I got it, I couldn\u2019t say, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t come, because I have a good job in Berlin.\u201d So I came to America."

So that was coming back to -- to this place, to -- to Budapest, 1t was ruined by -- by the Germans and it was ruined by the Hungarian Nazis and then it was ruined by the Russians. So it was a pretty bad situation, but everybody tried to survive and there was no -- no difference between Jews, non-Jews. We -- we were musicians. We played in the orchestra and -- and there was craving for -- for some culture after awhile, but we played in this overcoats because there was no heat. So it was a very, very strange situation."

Well, they took me from a Swedish -- Swedish pro-protected house, too. But in general, Jews from the countryside were deported much earlier than -- than what happened to me, or us. And the surviving Hungarian Jews were all either in hiding or in -- in ghettos that were so- called liberated by the Russians."

            "answer": "We didn\u2019t really know too much in the beginning, who survived, who didn\u2019t survive? Who was around, who wasn\u2019t around? It was a strange world all together. And I remember that a school -- school friend of mine, I didn\u2019t see him again, not until just a few years ago, he was in -- in Chicago and he talked to me. I knew his father was 1n the same transport, walking to Vienna and then on the -- on the cattle car wizness going to -- being transported to Hamburg mayan gummer. And I saw him die in -- in the camp. He was in the same barracks where -- where I was. So, I didn\u2019t see him when I came home, but I knew certain things. And I saw one of my friend from school, who became a -- a partisan in -- in -- in Russia, fighting on the side of the Russians, against the Germans. He came back with the Russians to Budapest and became a high positioned police officer, who was trying to find and did find th-the Nazis who -- the Hungarian Nazis who were responsible for most of the atrocities that took place. So it was strange, it was a very strange world and -- and -- and I left it behind and came back to it. But by then it was a little better, where I was concertmaster in the opera house, but we still didn\u2019t have peace. Not just peace, but bombed out buildings and -- and bombed out apartments and -- and very little -- very little food. The Russians took as much as was movable, they took. They- they dismantled toilets in the hotels and -- and washing -- wash basins and took them, because most of these -- these so-called soldiers, they have never seen anything that rem - rem -- that is close to co-comfort and that is close to luxury. So they -- they got -- they went wild. They took the watches off -- off your arm and they had -- some of them had five, six watches on their arms. Duvi, duvi, that was the -- the word. Give, give, whatever you can. And they took the rings off the fingers of the people and -- and the watches and it was a very strange world, but you know, it just comes to me sporadically, when I talk about it. Otherwise, I don\u2019t think about it."

And I couldn\u2019t play an audition for the opening for the following years, but I was offered a -- a position that was not a union position. The Aspen School of Music, the Aspen Festival was av-available for me and that\u2019s where I we-went during the summer, which wasn\u2019t a bad summer, to spend the first summer in -- in America in Aspen, which was very nice. And then I had to fly back to -- to New York to get my union card and then I played an audition and made it into the Minneapolis Symphony, as leader of the second violins. And that lasted one year. I mean it would -- could have lasted longer, but I wasn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t satisfied, I -- I wasn\u2019t happy with just being third or fourth member of the -- of the hierarchy in the violins.

Then- then I became more interested in 1t when -- when it became -- I think mostly with -- with the interview, with the Holocaust Museum interview, that I should remember it more and -- and talk about it more. The first time this Caparkone story came out, a friend of mine from London sent me a clipping from -- from the Times that was kind of a description of the Stan magazine\u2019s articles that came out every week, as a serial, about the Caparkone. So, the only -- only reason I knew about it, because he send me a Time mag -- and then I -- I started buying the Stan magazine issues. And that\u2019s how it all s- started, really.

Then we -- we became friendly, because he -- he looked me up when I was in Hamburg with the symphony.

It -- 1t is behind the Notterdam, sunk in the -- in the ground. You ge -- go down many, many steps and the sign outside says, \u201cTo the memory of deportees\u201d and then the number, hundred some thousand. And you go in, downstairs, underground, there is lights and every German concentration camps name, because there\u2019s a lot of French Jews who were in different camps. But it has nothing to do with Jews, it -- they don\u2019t want to have anything to do with it. And so that\u2019s -- you can cut this out if you want to. It -- that -- that\u2019s another place where -- where we saw a memorial. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s a very touching scene because it\u2019s underground, it\u2019s like a cellar and it\u2019s like bars and lights, little lights. And Yad Vashem, of course, we saw Yad Vashem. That\u2019s -- when we were in Israel we went to see Yad Vashem and that\u2019s the first time my wife saw the name written, Neuengamme.
