So police had all, where ever you lived, that district had a police department, and in there you had to register so they knew all the people who lived in their district because they were all registered. In other words, if I would try to go to another town and want to settle there I had to register within three days so they knew where we were and we didn\u2019t have to show anything or they didn\u2019t take my ID, my birth certificate, or they took my drivers license. But the action was to take all foreigners, all people who did not have, or Jews who did not have the German nationality. That was the action which took place in October, 1938. Because the German Jews were not touched at that time."
