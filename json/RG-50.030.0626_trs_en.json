And Mr. McClure, thank you very much for agreeing to meet with us today. I\u2019m going to start the interview as fairy tales do, at the very beginning. And that\u2019s going to be to ask you your \u2014 when you were born, the date you were born, what was your family like, and we'll take it from there.",
            "answer": "Well, I was born in\u2014 on March 8\", 1919 in New York City, and lived there for the next 20 years of my life. I never went back, really. So I\u2014 my recollections of course, are of a nearly ra \u2014 a disruptive period. We were going through the Great Depression, and I thought for a while I was more or less exempt from the effects of this thing. But my father was an engineer and he got very sick early in his life, and died at 53."

So, we had no debt, and never borrowed from anybody for anything, and the result is that we were relatively well off when things went awry. But, there was a fund, of course, for the future, for my education [indecipherable] and that suddenly disappeared, because they knew that my father was mortally ill, and we were going to have to take over in some fashion, and this 1s \u2014 this would be very dis- disorganizing, as it was.

And the thing is, he had no education either. He \u2014 he was born in Ohio, and he went to the good schools.

And so I-I got the \u2014 my friend sent me the local paper \u2014 matter of fact, all of the local papers. And I noticed that one was a weekly, which looked more like an American paper than any of the others. There was the lingering influence of the British journalism, with the ads on the page one and that sort of thing. This was different, this had headlines on page one [indecipherable] news on page one. And I was really intrigued by this. And I had already started my self-education, read every book that had to do with journalism. I Interview with Brooks McClure ' July 7, 2011 don\u2019t know whether I understood it or not, but at any rate, I did that. And \u2014 and then one day I got the notion that maybe these people out in poor old Australia, would like to have a correspondent in the United States."

And so these were very special needs. One was, of course, the local aspect, of the \u2014 of news, and the other was London. And \u2014 but I said th \u2014 I-I decided to write a letter to the editor. So I went to the British \u2014 the \u2014 I don\u2019t read it any more, but oh, I can\u2019t remember the name of it. At any rate, it\u2019s \u2014 was \u2014 it\u2019s a\u20141t\u2019s a British publication, similar, but rather more serious than the World Almanac for \u2014 that we have."

And so I thought, well, in the British commonwealth, they speak English, and that\u2019s the only thing I can speak, so I wrote them a letter and I said, I am a student of journalism. No mention of grade, age, anything like that. So, I had the \u2014 and I followed my father\u2019s rules.

So I just said in plain English that I was a\u2014a journalism student [indecipherable] without experience as of now, but I noticed their paper, and I noticed that they had correspondents in these other places, and none in the United States. So would they be interested in taking me on, course free, as a correspondent. And I thought afterwards, what a stupid thing to do, you know. I consulted no one, and I got \u2014 I had the shivers afterwards. Then, in the normal turn of events, which between the United States and \u2014 and Australia is about two months, I got a letter back, and it was from the publisher, who said, you know, we are \u2014 we are interested in you. We have to know a lot more about you, but then he said, let\u2019s consider it a possibility. And so I did, I\u2014 I found the name of the editor of the publication: that was on the masthead of course, And I wrote him and sent him a very Interview with Brooks McClure \u201d July 7, 2011 long article about the failure of the \u2014 0-0-of Roosevelt\u2019s policies.

But at any rate, he was a good \u2014 good old boy, an Irish American, and he looked in his flushed face [indecipherable] and he looked very affable, friendly, took care of his non-coms and was very much appreciated. So, he had come into the office just before me, and he got a call from the director of the museum. And the director said oh, he was very sorry, had to bother him Interview with Brooks McClure July 7, 2011 this way, but he heard about the \u2014 the exchange of troops. We had gone on the \u2014 on the u-upper Austrian side of the Donau river, and had \u2014 the Russians had moved in too far when we \u2014 when we met. There was a clerical error. So that was passed. The Russians were in that territory, we didn\u2019t try to throw them out, of course. But they were advanced maybe \u2014 maybe a couple of miles on \u2014 on what was supposed to be a straight line of division. And so they now \u2014 now decided that they would settle all this at the very highest level. Probably Patton himself participated, and they decided they\u2019d better change this. So they got together with the Russians and with perfect agreement on it, the Russians would pull back, and we would mo \u2014 we\u2019d move forward into that area. And when \u2014 although we didn\u2019t know anything, or I didn\u2019t know anything, of course, let me say that when I say we don\u2019t know, that means I don\u2019t know. But at any rate, I didn\u2019t know there were planning to do this, they didn\u2019t consult me. And so, both the major and I were very upset. What happened was, when we first came in, the major went over to this museum, and talked to the director, who seemed to be a perfectly reasonable sort of person, to see were there kind of any pictures that were reputed to have been put there by Hitler. And \u2014 excuse \u2014"

And he said, he se \u2014 he was sort of apologetic because he knew he should have revealed this before. Although I do \u2014 I think if that had happened, what would happen is the Russians would have stiffened, and taken him away. So we\u2019re probably lucky that this happened.

But he \u2014 we could have all been wiped out. Was the craziest thing, going over the Linz bridge, to the other side of the Donau, and feeling that you might be going to your death. Anyway, there we were, all armed, everybody had a rifle or a machine gun or something, whatever had been assigned to them. And it was a \u2014 I thought it was a comical thing afterwards, but I didn\u2019t think that \u2014 very much that way at the time. So we all went in a little convoy, with the major out ahead in a Jeep, and most of us back in the trucks. We had two big trucks, and we didn\u2019t know how much we were going to face. Well, we got out there, and in very short order I remember thinking, if I were driving, I wouldn\u2019t have been that \u2014 that \u2014 that good. But we arrived in there, in the top of an enormous barn. You know the way those barns were constructed? They used the upper levels for hay that they dropped down in the spring. And so there were the pictures, among a lot of fressen for the cow \u2014 for the \u2014 the bulls, or what have you. And the \u2014 we became a little worried, because the biggest thing of the lot \u2014 not \u2014 not \u2014 not the \u2014 the heaviest thing was an unusual shape. It was about two feet wide, two feet high, and about six feet long, and weighed like lead, oh. We c \u2014 we \u2014 we could move the pictures pretty easily, but this thing, we didn\u2019t know what it was, we couldn\u2019t take the time to open it, and so we thought we had [indecipherable] take \u2014 take it. So for Interview with Brooks McClure .\" July 7, 2011 our two and a half ton truck, we \u2014 we put it on the \u2014 the \u2014 down early. But it took all the muscular strength we could master.
