And Mr. McClure, thank you very much for agreeing to meet with us today. I\u2019m going to start the interview as fairy tales do, at the very beginning. And that\u2019s going to be to ask you your \u2014 when you were born, the date you were born, what was your family like, and we'll take it from there.",
            "answer": "Well, I was born in\u2014 on March 8\", 1919 in New York City, and lived there for the next 20 years of my life. I never went back, really. So I\u2014 my recollections of course, are of a nearly ra \u2014 a disruptive period. We were going through the Great Depression, and I thought for a while I was more or less exempt from the effects of this thing. But my father was an engineer and he got very sick early in his life, and died at 53."

So, we had no debt, and never borrowed from anybody for anything, and the result is that we were relatively well off when things went awry. But, there was a fund, of course, for the future, for my education [indecipherable] and that suddenly disappeared, because they knew that my father was mortally ill, and we were going to have to take over in some fashion, and this 1s \u2014 this would be very dis- disorganizing, as it was.

Then, in the normal turn of events, which between the United States and \u2014 and Australia is about two months, I got a letter back, and it was from the publisher, who said, you know, we are \u2014 we are interested in you.

And get \u2014 got to know a very affable, probably 25 year old major who was working there too. He was an infantry officer, a big man. I \u2014 apparently he certainly never showed any fear or anxiety under extreme pressure. But at any rate, I reported in one day. It was across town, I was with ya \u2014 with my infantry friends, and \u2014 eating there and so forth. So I came in one morning, about eight o\u2019clock I suppose, and there was this major whose name I can\u2019t remember \u2014 and that\u2019s a shame, you know, that just \u2014 should never forget the name of somebody who made such an impression. But at any rate, he was a good \u2014 good old boy, an Irish American, and he looked in his flushed face [indecipherable] and he looked very affable, friendly, took care of his non-coms and was very much appreciated. So, he had come into the office just before me, and he got a call from the director of the museum.

We had gone on the \u2014 on the u-upper Austrian side of the Donau river, and had \u2014 the Russians had moved in too far when we \u2014 when we met. There was a clerical error. So that was passed. The Russians were in that territory, we didn\u2019t try to throw them out, of course. But they were advanced maybe \u2014 maybe a couple of miles on \u2014 on what was supposed to be a straight line of division. And so they now \u2014 now decided that they would settle all this at the very highest level. Probably Patton himself participated, and they decided they\u2019d better change this. So they got together with the Russians and with perfect agreement on it, the Russians would pull back, and we would mo \u2014 we\u2019d move forward into that area. And when \u2014 although we didn\u2019t know anything, or I didn\u2019t know anything, of course, let me say that when I say we don\u2019t know, that means I don\u2019t know. But at any rate, I didn\u2019t know there were planning to do this, they didn\u2019t consult me. And so, both the major and I were very upset. What happened was, when we first came in, the major went over to this museum, and talked to the director, who seemed to be a perfectly reasonable sort of person, to see were there kind of any pictures that were reputed to have been put there by Hitler.
