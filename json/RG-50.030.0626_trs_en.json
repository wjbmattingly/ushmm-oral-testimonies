And there was a battle at Aron between the French and the British. Maybe you remember it. I don\u2122t know how they [indecipherable] but this was a pretty exciting story because the British and French were allies, and they \u0152 the French had been trying to get Admiral Darlan , who was in command of the French forces, to \u0152 to surrender, and the \u0152 the French were very stubborn; they wouldn\u2122t surrender. So finally the British said, all right, if you don\u2122t surrender, we\u2122re going to fight you. And they started this battle, a really horrible thing because the casualty rate was enormous.

I \u0152 apparently he certainly never showed any fear or anxiety under extreme pressure. But at any rate, I reported in one day. It was across town, I was with ya \u0152 with my infantry friends, and \u0152 eating there and so forth.

But they were advanced maybe \u0152 maybe a couple of miles on \u0152 on what was supposed to be a straight line of division. And so they now \u0152 now decided that they would settle all this at the very highest level. Probably Patton himself participated, and they decided they\u2122d better change this. So they got together with the Russians and with perfect agreement on it, the Russians would pull back, and we would mo \u0152 we\u2122d move forward into that area. And when \u0152 although we didn\u2122t know anything, or I didn\u2122t know anything, of course, let me say that when I say we don\u2122t know, that means I don\u2122t know. But at any rate, I didn\u2122t know there were planning to do this , they didn\u2122t consult me. And so, both the major and I were very upset. What happened was, when we first came in, the major went over to this museum, and talked to the director, who seemed to be a perfectly reasonable sort of person, to see were there kind of any pictures that were reputed to have been put there by Hitler. And \u0152 excuse \u0152"

And he said, he se \u0152 he was sort of apologetic because he knew he should have revealed this before. Although I do \u0152 I think if that had happened, what would happen is the Russians would have stiffened, and taken him away. So we\u2122re probably lucky that this happened.

But he \u0152 we could have all been wiped out. Was the craziest thing, going over the Linz bridge, to the other side of the Donau , and feeling that you might be going to your death. Anyway, there we were, all armed, everybody had a rifle or a machine gun or something, whatever had been assigned to them. And it was a \u0152 I thought it was a comical thing afterwards, but I didn\u2122t think th at \u0152 very much that way at the time. So we all went in a little convoy, with the major out ahead in a Jeep, and most of us back in the trucks. We had two big trucks, and we didn\u2122t know how much we were going to face. Well, we got out there, and in very short order I remember thinking, if I were driving, I wouldn\u2122t have been that \u0152 that \u0152 th at good. But we arrived in there, in the top of an enormous barn. You know the way thos e barns were constructed? They used the upper levels for hay that they dropped dow n in the spring. And so there were the pictures, among a lot of fressen for the cow \u0152 for the \u0152 the bulls, or what have you. And the \u0152 we became a little worried, because the biggest thing of the lot \u0152 not \u0152 not \u0152 not the \u0152 the heaviest thing was an unusual shap e. It was about two feet wide, two feet high, and about six feet long, and weighed like lead, oh. We c \u0152 we \u0152 we could move the pictures pretty easily, but this thing, we didn\u2122t know what it wa s, we couldn\u2122t take the time to open it, and so we thought we had [indecipherable] take \u0152 take it. So for Interview with Brooks McClure July 7, 2011 60our two and a half ton truck, we \u0152 we put it on the \u0152 the \u0152 down early. But it took all the muscular strength we could master.
