So they'd be flying along and we'd be just sort of zigzagging because it was _+ get ahead of them. So we could only stay with them for maybe 15, 20 minutes before anothersquadron would come in to take over and escort them alittle bit further. So most all our missions in the beginning were escort missions, high altitude, 28 - 30,000 feet, escortingbombers. Some of our missions later ran into the area were low-altitude missions where we'd go in and dive bomb a bridge, dive bomb atunnel, shoot up atrain, whatever our mission was. But most of them -- probably I'd say 60, 70 percent were escort missions and some were just \"let's go in and target of opportunity.\" You see something moving, try to stop it from moving. Yeah."

Go over, come back, refuel, go over and try to stop convoy coming into the front, this type of thing. That was on June 6th. And I flew anumber of missions in between there. And on June 12 is when I was shot down. We were, again, looking for targets of opportunity on the ground and actually saw noenemy aircraft.They were just scarce. So they were just like milk runs. And June 12th, out of the blue came probably 30 ME-109s, and out of the 16 aircraft they shot down 12 of us. [mean you couldn't turn anywhere without having a 109 onyour tail, you know.

We were in aroom, each room held eight prisoners. We put all our Red Cross parcels together. So even if we had four parcels, because we were on half rations, and we just sort of planned our meals. We had one cook stove. Each room had so much time on the cook stove. We started in the morning -- each room got one or two brickets. We'd start a fire and we'd keep it going and each room would taketime to prepare some sort of a meal for your room or they would do it through their room. Or sometimes you ate a meal early, sometimes you ate ameal late, but it was just taken you only had one kitchen and you took turns using it.

Beck, he got pneumonia, was put in the hospital in Buchenwald and he died there. He was the only fatality we really had of prisoners that I knew or prisoners that I waswith. I stayed in correspondence with his mother for anumber of years. Every time the allies got close they'd force marched us out. And the first one was in the dead of winter. I think we were given two hours to get ready to march in the end of January. And it was a blizzard. We were trying to put together every scrap of food that we could put our hands on. We tried to take apart our beds to make a Sleigh to haul, our bedding -- anything that we could carry.
