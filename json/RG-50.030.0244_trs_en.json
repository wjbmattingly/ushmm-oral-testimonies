And when I say mechanized, everybody went in different dire ctions. And, uh, then I wound up on the West Coast...uh, with the 107th Calvary, and they eventually broke that up and moved us to Camp Hood. It's Port Hood now. The mechanized outfit.

You would have to go around to the side and shoot them and knock the tracks, the half tracks off of them, and that's how you destroyed them, and then they started fading, and people started...the Vermax started to give up...you know what I mean...and everybody...the horse drawn, there was a lot of horses, and they were...dead people...I hate to get into this...were all over the place. I mean, you know, soldiers, horses and dead horses and just everything until...

            "answer": "They were...the farm houses over there...it wa s...some of the tanks...there was 2 or 3 times that our tank that we had we'd be going down the hill and we make a turn, and we slide into the farm house, and just knock a hole. You see the farm house...the pe ople lived on top of the farmhouse, and the, uh, uh, cows and everyt hing was in the bottom of the farm house. And they were good people there. They were good people and they...the Vermark, I don't believe wanted war. I don't believe they wanted war. I mean 2 or 3 of them surrendered to me, just walked up and surrendered to me. And, uh, uh, I don't believe...now of course the SS they were very staunch and they wanted to do everything what they wanted to do, and they are very cold hearted people I guess you might put it in that they cared about nothing, but only the father land and they believed that that...uh...we would have our hardest battles with the Panzer Division which was right close to the SS and uh, uh, they were hard. They were good fighters. I mean they are not...you coul d never take that away from them, they were very good fighters, and they fight to the bitter end, \u201atil they died, you see. And, uh, I lost a lot of friends in battle. I seen battle. I was in battle, and one of my dear friends who was one...was a tank driver...his name was Buck les...Captain Brennan told him a thousand times that when you go into battle, you buckle up. Down with the Buckles couldn't do that. He had to have his head up, and they blew his head off. And I have had a lot of friends of mine that died in... We would st ay...I hope this gets to some of the old timers. If we would get into a farm house and it was vacant, and we got to sleep at night we would try to get in where...close up to where they shoot...if they were going to shoot that morning, they would shoot through the windows, and we would be under there avoiding them, you see. Avoiding the bullets, avoiding the bullets because they would shoot in, and they would go to the door on the other end, but we were close over by the war. Let me specify that. And it's a great feeling to get up in the morning, and you don't know if you are going to die or not, that you lived and that you...that you...it's ju st a great feeling when it was all over with that you can say you lived and we moved out many times ear ly morning to go fight, but not fight at night. Not until that daybreak because you had to see what's going on, and you would...you could...uh...the...we would fight and then if it's to o heavy, the big tanks would come in and they would make a diamond. And I seen a lot of American boys...I knew I was in that tank...and I knew there were American infantry men all around me, and they were...the only protection they had was that tank or a tank, and they were outside and I was in. However, if the tank was hit, one of our Lieutenants, Lieutenant Benslak, his tank was hit. He burned up in it. Everybody burns if it is hit properly enough. And see, these memories I have for 40 years. (sobbing) USHMM Archives RG-50*0244 5"

It's an odor that you won't forget. I don't care...there is no way that you wi ll forget it. And I asked the one fellow, a Polish boy, I said,\"Benny, what do you think we ought to do?\" He said, \"We can't see a thing.

I don't know where Ed is today. Uh...We did talk about it in Chicago in the in the 50s the last time I seen him. He was in Chicago. He was a New York man. I don't know USHMM Archives RG-50*0244 6 where he is today. I hope he is still living. Anyhow we went to...when sunup, we went and we seen this huge, huge...it looked like a fort...like the old time forts with all the logs up on them...they looked like telephone poles, that 's how big they were now. I am not exaggerating that. But they were just lumber. I mean, they were just a tree cut down and put there.

They were wasted to nothing. Absolutely nothing! They would bring these men into these salt mines. This was a salt mine. And they were...I would assume they were big men, and they would whittle them down to nothing, and they're.. They would not feed them. They would give them potato peelings, and, uh, that's what the inmates told us, and that, uh, they would have so much cubic, piece of bread, and the guards, who were ex-convicts of German...they were German ex-convicts ran these camps...I mean would...ran the barracks. They would come and ask how many people was there that the inmates would tell it, and we want half of that in the morning when roll call would come. And they...I went and I seen...from there, we proceeded...we tried to feed them, and we had to feed them under a guard, under an armed guard, a soup line, so they wouldn't get out and they wouldn't feed up their stomach. They didn't have...they were just bones. There was nothing to these people. It was terrible. And their stomach...they could only digest the soup. They couldn't...they didn't have nothing to digest. They didn't have no body, r eally. Anyhow, we got that...and if you would throw a cigarette down, 4 or 5 inmates would jump on that cigarette, a butt of a cigarette, to smoke that cigarette, see. And then we went in to the barracks, and they were high and there were 2 men to each bunk. And then we proceeded and then they told us to go to the crematorium. 4 high and 2 to each bunk. The inmates asked us to come to the crematorium. We didn't know what we were going into. We were...they asked us, \"Please come.\" I remember going into there...going to there, and then I seen one room. I would say there was 500 bodies stacked there. At least 500. I am not exaggerating. I took pictures of them in my album and if anybody sees this in St. Louis, I w ould like to refer to my album that I gave to the St. Louis Jewish Council on Ala Street in 1946 of January, when I was discharged out of the Army. But getting back to that, their ta ttoos was not on their arm. There were some on their arm. Displaced person! But these peop le in this...in this room...these bodies, I USHMM Archives RG-50*0244 7 should say, the tattoos were on their chest. And then we proceeded from that room to go to the crematorium, and they would put 2 people on a slab in this crem atorium. They would have...they had operating tables there. They would take the gold out of their teeth...gold out of their teeth, and make rings out of them. A nd on the sign of the crematorium, it says, \"My body would rather be burned than go into the ground, and they would push them into the crematorium to burn them, which they would be gone in 15 minutes or whatever it took them. Very quick! But on this thing, I know, I wa s trying to find a word for it last night and I found this word. Hitler wanted to exterminate the Jews and this is terrible, and God would not let that happen. I heard other stories. Not in this particular camp, in other camps down the years, that they would have the Jewish people go into a room and tell them that they were taking a shower...you probably heard this story...where they would gas them.
