This is an interview with Eddie Willner, conducted by Arwin Donohue, on July the 12\", 2000, at his home in Falls Church, Virginia. This is a follow up to a USHMM video interview that was conducted with Mr. Willner, on May 25\", 1989. And this is tape number one, side A. Okay, one thing that I wanted to ask you about Mr. Willner, is that in the first interview that the Holocaust Museum did with you, there -- we didn\u2019t discuss your -- your childhood at all, before Kristallnacht. And I wondered if you would say something about your -- your father, and your mother, and your -- your school experience.",
            "answer": "Okay, I said before, I was born in Munchinglapba, which is in the Rhineland, near Cologne, between Cologne and Dusseldorf. And I am a fairly good rec -- recol -- recollection. My mother already is born in that city, and my father was born about 20 miles from there. And my father got to know my mother because of World War One. He was in the German army, in the front line, and just like today when we have a war, on -- World War Two, families send packages to their sons, who are soldiers, or -- or communities do that to the sons of the community who are fighting wars. And so in my father\u2019s case, he received, while he was in Russia, so-called care packages, and -- from the Winter family. We had a Willners, and the Winter family had two daughters and one son."

The period in Germany, in that time, was bad, just like in the United States. We had the collapse of the stock market, [indecipherable] by World War One, and there were many people without jobs, and many upheavals. Communists and others. And so I -- I assumed that they knew each other since the end of the war, since that\u2019s when he went there first, but they got married 1924. And so six years later, and I arrived another two years later, I was the only child of -- and I also think I know is shu -- that\u2019s reason my parents had only one child, because the situation -- the economic situation in Germany was very bad, complete collapse. And my father did have a job, and so we -- apparently, they had no problems, but they decided just to have one Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection child. And then Hitler came on the scene, and then su-sure enough, a lot of Jews didn\u2019t have a -- had less children, and in my father\u2019s case, he lived, like I said, 20 miles from where I was born, and his father lived in that same house in the country, til 1941, and he was -- then they took him out of his house, they took the house away from him, and sold it, the Nazi party, and they gave it to a Nazi, was -- and -- and so in -- in that house were all the belongings of the Willner family, which were demolished on the Crystal night. And I[ have to tell a story about my father, because it was different in many cases, 1n this case, 1t was -- it turned out pretty good. When my -- when Crystal night happened, they burned the synagogues, and they demolished Jewish homes, stores, and wrote Jew on buildings belonging to Jews. My fa-father went -- left the -- he knew there was something going on against the Jews, and he went to look after his father, lived by himself, almost 80 years old, and -- but pretty fit, but he want to see then he\u2019s okay, so he | -- went there, and when he came to the house -- like I tell you, 1s a small community in the country, maybe about 500 people living there. And he had a tha -- I think the house must have been built just before World War One.[indecipherable] and he walked in, and he knew that something going on inside. As he walked in, he saw Na-Nazis in -- in uniform, the Brown shirts, smashing everything in the place. My grandfather standing by and, watching, not saying anything. So my father walked in, he knew that he -- he shouldn\u2019t have come, maybe, except for his father. And the chief of police of the little town of Klaifaht was there. The chief of police was not a Nazi, he was in uniform, police uniform. And my father walked in, he says, \u201cSiegfried,\u201d which was his name, \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d The connection between him and the chief of police was that when they were little children, or boys, they sat together on a -- on a school bench for several years. And they knew each other very -- very well. So he couldn\u2019t, in front of other people, Germans, say, \u201cDisappear, get out of here -- here.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know why you came here.\u201d He said, \u201cWell [indecipherable] look after my father.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201c[indecipherable] I\u2019m looking after your father, nothing happens to him.

They always sent in German, they didn\u2019t use the same people from the same city, always from the next city, or so. And he -- \u201cI cannot prevent any smashing of materials, but I will see to it that fath -- your father isn\u2019t hurt. And by the way,\u201d he said, \u201cyou know your brother is in prison here.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d This was the son, the younger brother, who was li-living in the house with ma -- my grandfather, but had moved out [indecipherable] he got married. He was married to a Christian woman, whose brothers were Nazis, and asked her to divorce him under the Nuremberg laws. And she refused.

They went to a place in Holland, like a camp, but a Catholic organization was taking care of them, too. Moved them maybe to Brazil, or someplace in South America. And --"

I went to my school, I had to leave German school, because Jewish children could not be in the classroom with the German children. And so I went to then, the new school, Jewish school, one they installed in the back room of a synagogue, which was a Conservative synagogue. And then I wanted to go to school, and see what happens, and somebody said, \u201cYour s -- your school is burning.\u201d Well, 1t was synagogue that was burnt, but the school was in the synagogue. I wanted to take a look. Nobody bother me, some um -- most people, I mean, didn\u2019t know I was Jewish, you know. And the incident there was interesting. The Nazis put the thing -- this is a -- a [indecipherable] fire. And the -- the fire department showed up to put out the fire. And the -- not what the Nazis wanted, they wanted us to burn down, but they endangered, in many cases, the houses next to them, which were not Jewish houses.

So policeman took the hose, and started directing towards the synagogue.

Not Orthodox, they were -- they had kosher at home, but they didn\u2019t go to synagogue every [indecipherable] Saturday morning or Friday night. And my grandfather looked like a real Germanic type. He was blonde, had - the hair he had left, had a big moustache, and he looked like a German peasant, maybe. And so he had a lot of friends who were not Jewish, and we had no -- no -- none in particular [indecipherable] my family. There were other families who got beaten up, many of them. Some of them because they [indecipherable] alone and they was enable, took advantage of it, beat up a Jew, or smash his window. And in our place, the -- like I said, the police was pretty good. My uncle, my mother\u2019s brother, Neil, had been arrested Crystal night, and sent to Dachau concentration camp. He was also a decorated war veteran, he had the Iron Cross. He had -- he brought home from the war, his saber, which he was allowed to, because of his rank, and he had the Iron Cross. So before 1 -- Cr- Crystal night, two policemen came to the -- to my grandparents home where he lived, he was not married, and they said, \u201cWe have orders to pick up your saber, and your medals.\u201d He questioned that. He said, \u201cWe are police, we are not Nazi party members. We have an order we have to carry out.\u201d Ma -- they were excusing the action. They didn\u2019t even want to do it, but they -- policemen had to do it. So my uncle said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He had a medal, he took the medals, threw them on the floor, and, \u201c\u201cYou can also have the saber.\u2019 And he threw the saber and broke the -- the blade. And he threw that on the floor to them. And they were very apologetic about it, and, \u201cWe\u2019re just carrying out orders. We are sorry. It\u2019s not our doing, but is our order.\u201d And they took -- and they took my great-grandfather, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection whom I also knew. He got to be 96. He was also in the house, and he used to be a public school teacher, and he had received for his work what they call the Hohnsellon medal. Hohnsellon was the German Kaiser, of the Hohnsellon family. And he gave awards, and medals out to people who are deserving, who did something for the state, or for the country. And he had that framed on the wall, the medal and certificate. And they said, \u201cBy the way, we have to take that, too.\u201d My uncle [indecipherable] military, but every Jew -- Jews don\u2019t have the right to have medals any more. So, he took -- they took that, too. But they did no harm. So, to continue the story for my father. The police just took him back to the police building, and the jail was attached to it, it was just a couple of cells. And the police chief said to my father, \u201cWant to see your brother?\u201d And they opened the door, and there are five Jews in there, men, his brother included. And they had a -- they were playing cards. They had food in there, and they were -- you know what, they were being nice to bi -- and he said -- he was [indecipherable], \u201cSay good-bye to your brother, because frankly I don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going to see him again,\u201d this police chief said. Well, they didn\u2019t think about Dachau, but that\u2019s where he went, Dachau. And if my father would have been [indecipherable] he would have gone, too. But, he -- the chief said, \u201cI don\u2019t have an arrest warrant for you here. They probably have a [indecipherable] your hometown. So I have to make a call.\u201d And he called the chief in Mitchiglumba, and he said, \u201cI have a,\u201d -- I think he said old friend of mine, apparently [indecipherable] and he didn\u2019t say, I have a Jew here by the name of Willner, and he an old friend of mine. \u201cI don\u2019t have an arrest warrant wi -- but he lives in your city. Would USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 10 you check, please?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, he\u2019s on the list to be arrested.\u201d So the guy that was my father\u2019s friend, he, \u201cOkay, I\u20191l send him back to you.\u201d Hung up the phone, and of course my father listened to all of this. And the chief said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what Siegfried. The next bus is at 11 o\u2019clock, you will be on it, back to your home, and then you will report to the police, which is what we agree [indecipherable] here.\u201d And he did like this -- your problem.

            "answer": "Okay, we es -- we escaped, of course, from a transport of Langenstein concentration camp, to -- we were going east. That I knew. I knew a couple [indecipherable] from a map I had seen. I didn\u2019t have any maps. And Langenstein concentration camp was one that was going to be a temporary camp for the building of tunnels, to produce the wheat to underground, because the factories were all bombed out by the ally. And Michael Swab, that\u2019s one of my best friends, and I describe Michael, how I met him in a camp. His father was killed, and his brother-in-law. They were frozen to death. They came back from work and they had been told they did not perform properly, they were sabotaging German wer -- wer -- for these 150 germ -- 150 Dutch Jews, who had arrived at this small camp, which was about 600 people, to repair railr -- railroads, and then -- so Mike\u2019s fa- father and brother came back from work one day, and they were accused not having worked properly, and they s -- wanted to make example of them. They stood these people up in the middle of the winter, which 1s pretty bad in Poland, not like here, and they took a fire hose, and hosed them down with cold water. Ordered them to stand, they couldn\u2019t rub themselves dry and warm, it was ice cold water. And to make a long story [indecipherable] by next morning they were -- most of them, they were dead. Mike\u2019s father and brother-in-law, Morron. That\u2019s where we came -- there were f -- I spoke Dutch, that was the other thing. I think I explained before why I -- how I came to speak Dutch, I picked up a Dutch -- [indecipherable] Dutch was very inposit. So, when we emptied the camp, they had a new method, I thought. In the previous Death March, that we had from Bleshammer to Roshosen, we marched everybody together, 4,000 some Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 12 people that marched out. But there were other people came in from other camps, smaller camps, so the -- Swallhallingpoint, which was our camp. And so, there were actually more than 4,000, I didn\u2019t know that til after the war. All through my friend, Mizza Kraning. And they decided, when we walked out of Langenstein, to walk out in groups of 500, which was for better control, in case some people may escape. And there are 4,000 people coming, and -- which was good for us, too. Not every group had a police dog, German Shepherd, or had a lot of guards. Some of the guards were ol-older guys, older SS men, and they knew the war was finished, they lost. And so -- but, we didn\u2019t walk -- want to walk out, Mike and I, and we hid for awhile, and then we saw the Germans put up machine guns. I figured they\u2019re going to execute everybody in front of the camp. Well, they made a last appeal over the PA system, they said, \u201cThis 1s the last call, everybody get out of the back who 1s left, who is hiding. If you don\u2019t be marched out, you will -- you know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d So Michael and I decided we got up -- not disappear, but in the final stand, sh-shoot out on the spot. We stayed there through some cases. We went to -- or came out of hiding, and there was a double wall in one of the barracks, and we were loit the last group walking out, and we lucky we did, because I have pictures from the v-video from the National Archives, that was taken on the camp, we were in the middle, where the barracks were, the -- how do you call his?

                " -- we had talked about this many times befo -- before our escape. We thought it would be good to escape the dog or dogs, if we swam through a river, because they couldn\u2019t pick up the smell in the water. And -- or, 1n case there was no water, they would go after the prisoner, then bite them, go for their throat. And then by their barking, attract the guards, help them finish the job. So, when we crossed the bridge, for awhile, our luck was on our side. We knew where the river was, we could just cross the bridge, but -- and there were planes overhead, so we knew they couldn\u2019t put any searchlights on. And we were told -- we were marching ranks of four, two to one side, and two to the other side sumweech. And the SS were -- they went a little bit further out, and we got -- then they\u2019re going to hit just as much as we would if they stayed there.

Michael and I [indecipherable] and running the other way, but running the river way. And we also didn\u2019t know who could swim. Well, we talked about it, and some guys were too weak to swim. And Mike and I could swim, which was no problem. And the river was a tiny little thing, but enough to get the dog off our back. And not dogs, and -- one dog. So we got into the water, which was of course, ice cold, and the dog got Mike in the leg, but we -- we want to strangle the dog.

            "question": "Did it surprise you that the American soldiers were so kind to you, and so concerned about you? Did you question why they were?",
            "answer": "Yes, in a way I did, but I remember it made me so comfortable. The only -- frankly, I\u2019m sorry to say, the only guy that made me uncomfortable was a Jewish guy in the unit, because not what he did towards us or anything, 1t was the way he behaved. We came out of an anti-Semitic world, or group, and we -- myself -- we behaved, before we became prisoners, while we were prisoners, in a way that normal -- but em -- let me say I didn\u2019t USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 29 fin -- I hate to say this, cause it sounds like prejudice, but it isn\u2019t. Jews from eastern Europe are different Jews from western Europe, because they grew up in ghettos, the eastern European, the -- the western u -- was integrated, like my family was. I didn\u2019t know that I was Jewish until [indecipherable] I didn\u2019t know I was Jewish, I went to synagogue, but it never concerned me, never gave me a problem. And then came the Jews from the ghettos, and with the pious, and other things, and I was in the impression, the way the Nazis made us look bad, the Jews, they said all Jews are merchants, or they get the money out of pocket of a -- questioned the ma --[indecipherable]. I found out that some of the guys who came from Poland, because of their surroundings, were different people. And I look at them differently, just like the Germans -- the non-Jewish people looked at Germans who -- or who are Jewish, and [indecipherable] they said they like us. Whereas in Poland, because living conditions in Poland said these are not [indecipherable] Jews, or whatever, they\u2019re different. But in -- in the American army, the one Jew that I met in the company was not a nice guy, to start with, and nothing to do with being Jewish, but he did some of the things that Jews were oft accused of. He tried to make money, and the way he did it, he gambled with soldiers, he took the money out of their pocket. I\u2019m not saying that non-Jews don\u2019t do that, but I was a little bit more aware of things -- not to be criticized because I -- whatever I do is -- as a money business, or whatever. I was not in a position to anyway, but -- but there were things this guy did, and had w -- he won quite a bit of money, had already done this on the way over, on the ship, had made thousands of dollars. And so I -- the others were [indecipherable] and Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 30 they saw this, too. And they saw that we didn\u2019t associate very much with him, unless he associated with us, he was a -- and he was from New York. He was what you might call a ghetto type. Now, New York the ghetto, too. So New York Jews, I -- I -- I when people ask me where you from, some people think I\u2019m from New York, cause I pick up a little accent from the three months I was there. And -- and so I wa -- I wasn\u2019t very proud of him, he did a lot of things that didn\u2019t make me proud to be a Jew, or something I could -- you could say. I was ashamed for him. And so your answer to your question that the American were nice, yes, they -- they were nice, I found this guy Hansen, didn\u2019t speak German because he -- he felt very badly about, from a moral viewpoint that this happened by his former people that he came from. And he didn\u2019t like that. Like Lieutenant Hovlent was -- I found out after the war, was very religious, that\u2019s why he behaved that way, and the guys also, I -- I compare notes with many people, but soldiers behave different in war- in the war [indecipherable] conditions. Like the villages we were in, guys thought about taking the women, maybe the husband wasn\u2019t there, and didn\u2019t make any difference to them, and [indecipherable] it didn\u2019t happen our unit, not that anybody got caught, but -- but the guy that I don\u2019t -- didn\u2019t like, he would have been capable of doing such a thing. He tried it one time, and I -- we told him, Mike and I, sta -- stop. He came to the [indecipherable], I told you about that farm woman, that made the hot water for us. He wanted to go to bed with her, and he put his weapon on the table like -- like a threat. I- and, \u201cLouie, don\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t want to be a part of this. I had my problems with the Germans. I -- I do-don\u2019t do this because I love the Nazis, or that, but this 1s a human USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 31 being, don\u2019t do this. There\u2019s no -- this woman is not a -- walk around in uniform with the Nazis, tha -- she is just plain farm woman, and her husband\u2019s at the front because he was ordered that way. And you don\u2019t do this, be -- how would you come a soldier into your home?\u201d And he ever -- absolutely had been drinking too. And we told him that he better go home to his home. And he kept on, and we took away his rifle, because we thought he might -- not do anything to us, but [indecipherable] well, and we just [indecipherable] that he was the only one that we knew -- there may have been another guy was Jewish, but -- but we had good experiences too, after, and -- with Jews, and non-Jews. But he gave me a bitter taste in the mouth, and I -- he got married, and later had kids, I called him, and [indecipherable] but I never went to visit him, I just talked to him on the phone, you know. And the guys was nice to us, why, I -- well, basically because what we had endured. And there were many, and they\u2019d seen pictures in the paper, and read about it. So they probably felt a little sorry for us, but we didn\u2019t feel sorry for ourselves, so there was no problem. We weren\u2019t -- we were treated okay, like men, and -- and there were talks about them, we\u2019ll find a way -- they want to go to the United States, which Michael did. So [indecipherable] many nice people there, aga -- or say that you thought the Americans were nice. And we found out that a lot of them were of different background, like Louie was one, then we found Irish Catholic, and we found all kinds of religions. And maybe because some guys were religious, or believers, that\u2019s why they were nice. And people were not so nice. Cannot say that they were not religious, but they -- th-they - people like [indecipherable] that I said about Jews now, I [indecipherable] for the other USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 32 Poles too, who were not Jews, we had many experiences with them, too. Some of them were worse than the Germans, some of them were in guards, or were [indecipherable | from the area, were sometime with Germany, and sometimes not. And when we had Poles as supervisors for our work, they beat us like the SS did. So, I cannot make statement, all American are nice, or all are bad, or Jews, or whatever. And -- or Italians are a certain way. Yeah, I think that it\u2019s -- it -- it\u2019s [indecipherable], and we found out very early that we didn\u2019t -- like Nick Hansen was German [indecipherable]. I disagreed with him, I said, \u201cTalk to these people, not all of them are bad. If all of them had been bad, I wouldn\u2019t be here today. There were some good ones.\u201d But I -- my experience has been talking to people -- Americans, maybe Jewish people savay, that those who were not in the camps, hate the Germans more than the wa -- than the ones who were in the camp. That\u2019s an unusual thing. Because they say all Germans are bad, some of them are -- all -- all the Nazis are, they make -- don\u2019t differentiate be -- no Nazis. And so I saw Poles who- that were very bad, and who are -- had German SS, and some of the Poles, and know, you find bad and good everywhere, but being good, and being able to do good, also had something to do with material things. United States is a rich country. We had soldier chocolate there, had everything to eat. And it\u2019s easy to be a good guy sometimes, when you have a lot of things, if that\u2019s what needed, bread, or something to eat, be hungry. And then somebody -- the -- the person I feel is sometimes really good, a real great person, when they don\u2019t have much, and then give away something. And right now, I did pretty well in life, professionally. I worked hard, and I -- I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not dependent on USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 33 German government because I came out sick for the rest of my life, and get a small pension. The business that\u2019s going on now in getting back for the Jews, the -- some of the things that they owned, paintings, or getting pension, because they -- bec -- like Social Security, they say if you worked as slave labor, but -- but the companies that that used your slave labor should pay you compensation. I filed for it, I didn\u2019t want to. My wife did for me, I sign it, because I -- I certainly earned it, and I yi -- I -- I know -- I know I wor -- worked for what German companies, but I said they should have given it -- most people are dead already -- right after the war, and they\u2019re -- they\u2019re waiting so long til they\u2019re -- no -- not many left any more. So when the money comes, I'll take it, but I am not going to use it for myself, I\u2019m going to give it away. To my wife, who has been good to me, can do whatever she wants, and some percentage to a good cause, not necessarily a Jewish good cause. In my donations, I include the others as well as Jews. And I don\u2019t need their money, and I -- I tell you, I\u2019m torn from the experience that really upset me. I got myself examined by Germany, to file for [indecipherable] you know what the [indecipherable] is? Making [indecipherable], and normally you do that if you have a -- something happen to you, and you get -- you need medi -- medical help for your life, and the Germans pay for it, some extent. Well, number one, I went in the army, for various reasons, to give something back to this country, as a civil service employee, in the army now, in the army, also as a volunteer. And like I said, I got exa-examined, and they said to me, some people, \u201cYeah, but you -- you act like a -- like the strong guy, you\u2019re a military officer.\u201d He -- some -- some people said, \u201cYou don\u2019t look sick to me.\u201d And I said, \u201cI\u2019m not, I,\u201d -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 34 but -- but when you go in the -- the Germans, you got to tell them you -- you suffer. I didn\u2019t. That\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019m not suffering, I\u2019m happy, I don\u2019t need them, and -- but I did get myself examined, and they didn\u2019t pass the law, whether you have something or not, you get the minimum, if you have been one year in a camp, or more. So -- but then they came up with something else, not -- couple of years ago, which is like Social Security, say they worked, but they didn\u2019t pay in, but we owe it to them. We didn\u2019t pay them, si -- they came out with German Social Security, and they sent me a letter, and they said, \u201cYes, you entitled that, but you must pay in the basic sum, so we can start 1n to -- to make it So many quarters, you don\u2019t have enough.\u201d Or whatever, I -- I [indecipherable]. So I did that, and I figure I earned that. And they said, \u201cIn your -- with your background, you got yourself education after the war, which we consider college education, [indecipherable] military [indecipherable], and you -- so -- so you entitled to it. Who are you -- did you work for?\u201d And I did say it, and send the papers in. And then they said, \u201cYou got to get this exam done by a doctor in Washing, who 1s a confidential\u201d -- not -- what do you call it, not confidential, who do it confidentially for the German embassy. I went to see the doctor, was a German [indecipherable] in Washing, who had been taken prisoner in Africa, by Rommel, Africa corps. No, he was in Africa, but he was taken prisoner by the British. I start undressing for him to examine me, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re the same age.\u201d And, \u201cYou were in a concentration camp?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cOh yeah,\u201d he say, \u201cyou have a number.\u201d And then I took all my clothes off, he said, \u201cYou look better than I do, physically.\u201d Whatever that meant, and [indecipherable] would see that he was going to Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 35 give me negative, say this guy\u2019s in perfect shape, he [indecipherable] a mark on him.

And I came out I think I have it on the tape. We were left for dead, and the -- well they told me to use that, but the only thing I -- I was disqualified from the U.S. Army after one parachute jump. They told me that I should not jump, I am not going to be a jump bump -- this is a good thing to do if you -- if you [indecipherable] to jump, y-yo -- to show you got courage, to jump out an air- airplane. So the young officers all did it, I want to do it, too. And by the way, my children, [indecipherable] five out of six are par-parachutists. So, they had to do what the old man couldn\u2019t do. But anyway, then, so this Social Security from Germany, the guy, he -- I thought he is going to send me a confidential report. He send it to the embassy. I didn\u2019t see what he wrote, but he wrote nothing good for me that was in my favor, and nevertheless -- well, he probably was a Nazi, or anti-Semite. I don\u2019t know what he -- I had that feeling all along, that he thought I was getting something for nothing, and -- and I didn\u2019t, you know, I was entitled to it. So anyway, when he came out, they made a Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 36 ruling. After checking what could I have been, if I had, under normal circumstance, not in a concentration camp, not having to go 1n the army to make a living, and to -- what could I have been today? They gave a wide -- well, they gave me a high category, officer in the army alone, that the same thing, had went to college, or you become a -- a teacher, you have to have a certain intelligence, and they told me they going to give me a high rating in Social Security, but in that case, if I want a higher -- rating higher income, I have to pay them anyswhere between 20 and 40,000 dollar, whatever I choose of categories. It is not well known, but the reason was -- and if I do not choose the high income, the lowest one is you pay in 2,000 dollars, and you get [indecipherable] income when you\u2019re 65. Well, we had some friends in German embassy, and some other people [indecipherable]. And there is Leo, [indecipherable] language when they have the German, and this guy was the German finantha a -- finance attach\u00e9 at the embassy here. And -- and he said what -- any -- I said, if I had 20,000 dollar, 40,000 dollar, I -- I\u2019d rather invest it in here, in this country. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be Germany to-tomorrow, but I\u2019m not going to give them any money. I don\u2019t have that money to spare, and I -- it just didn\u2019t feel good about it. But the mistake I made [indecipherable]. So I -- I gave them 2,000 dollars. They advised me I should get my foot into the door, I\u2019m entitled to it [indecipherable] like those thing, but to -- to give to the la -- and then they give me small sum. Well, they came out with a small sum which was so insulting that I immediate -- I -- I didn\u2019t get upset very often about things I -- they\u2019re sending me every month a check, they have been for three, four years now, for 46 dollars. I think that\u2019s an insult for somebody who spent USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 37 three years in a concentration camp. And that becau -- now, if I would have given them 40,000 dollars, I\u2019m probably -- I don\u2019t know how much, I\u2019d probably get a thousand dollar a month income. I didn\u2019t do that. Well, I -- I would have liked to have that kind of money coming in, but I -- I -- I don\u2019t, and I do very well without them.

I feel -- felt that -- I guess if you know something about somebody, and the SS officer came to one of the towns that we occupied when I was with the tank company, and Mike went up there, I didn\u2019t know about it, had taken this gun along, we all were given a -- we both were given a caliber 45 pistol in case there was some problem.

But not this guy.\u201d Also was crippled, by the way, and I figured he\u2019s been punished. But we got out of there, [indecipherable], and I said, \u201cMichael, don\u2019t ever do this again.

And when he knew he was dying, in Holland, I Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 39 went to see him. And in Holland, you can die at home, [indecipherable] and you can also be given a pill to h-hasten it, you know? I don\u2019t know what he did, but he knew he was dying, and my oldest son, and my oldest daughter came [indecipherable] to them, they decided. And like I said, a couple of years ago I put a lifesaver card, they ask me [indecipherable]. I wasn\u2019t going to sell my whole story at that, I just [indecipherable] my best friend had this number, and then he died. And you\u2019re going to make one special for you.

It\u2019s just blind prejudice, I don\u2019t think you -- I think Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 42 you a good person, but you grew up that way, to -- not to like Negroes. And you get together people who think the same thing.\u201d And when the hou-house were being built here, the superintendent said -- he had some Black workers here, and when he talked about Black workers, \u201cWatch when they walk on the new grass. Don\u2019t let them walk on it.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWhere a Black walks on grass, no grass will ever grow again.\u201d \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.

So when I came to him the application, I said, \u201cYou probably not going to sponsor me, because you know how I feel about Blacks.\u201d \u201cOh here, let me think about it.\u201d Boy, and I give him time to think about it. You know, I didn\u2019t want to start to be the troublemaker in the neighborhood. So I went to my wife, and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I want to join the pool here.\u201d Which would be a good thing for the children. And then I decided, well, I\u2019m also depriving the children, my wife had to- we had only one car, I have the car, and she -- it\u2019s good for the health to go in the summer to the pool. I think I -- I -- I\u2019m going to talk to him. I went to him, and he said, \u201cTl sign you on, and I -- I get you another member to sign.\u201d I said, \u201cGood. But I also want you to know I\u2019m not joining your pool to be a troublemaker. I don\u2019t agree with your policies, and they going to be changed one day, and you know which side I\u2019m going to vote for, to let the Blacks in.\u201d And I felt that was necessary to say [indecipherable] know what kind of neighbor I am, and maybe he -- he won\u2019t have any part of me, but we became good friends, and he does anything for me I want him to do. He knows I\u2019m USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 43 Jewish, and they\u2019re Southern Baptists. And Southern Baptists were automatically against Blacks in those days. I went out with a girl one time in Richmond, when I went to school [indecipherable] and she was Southern Baptist, she took me on Sunday morning to a church, and I said, \u201cI\u2019m -- this -- I don\u2019t see any Blacks in here.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cthey\u2019re not welcome.\u201d I say, \u201cIn a church? Well, let\u2019s go then,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be ina church -- I\u2019m not very religious, but I don\u2019t want to be in a church that doesn\u2019t let everybody in. That\u2019s no church for me.\u201d So, come back to my neighbor, they don\u2019t call Blacks by nasty name. They are very dilerant. Their son, Ned Fortune, also called them niggers, and when he was very small, he changed. When he talked to my children, my children told him they don\u2019t like they u -- to use that word. And I really can see where he had a change of mind. He grew up that way, and his wife grew up that way. So, that\u2019s why I think, in a democracy, where you can say every -- anything you want."

And he -- his Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 44 roommate was a Black guy. And he changed his mind by living with a Black guy from Africa, not American Black.

I\u2019m not even saying I\u2019m proud of it either, but I\u2019m proud to be a Jew -- ?'m not proud to be anything else either, but I can be proud of something I\u2019ve accomplished. But, well, maybe my ancestors accomplished something, that\u2019s why people call them a proud Jew. But I -- the people who are anti-Semitic here in the United States, can be fought against openly. In other countries, they call themselves democracy, but are not a real democracy. And we have things that leave something to be desired, to -- maybe not the Jewish [indecipherable] something else, or the Black, particularly, have -- they\u2019re still being prejudiced. I always said, well, as a Jew I can go [indecipherable] have the right color. But if you\u2019re Black on top of it, you don\u2019t accept in the first place, just because of your color. But in America, there are many people -- and America has changed, even during the ti-time I\u2019ve been here, for the better. It\u2019s not perfect, it never claimed to be USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 45 perfect in question of race, or -- or many other thing, but we can change things here, as long as we stay a democracy, and have the [indecipherable] the -- that we have, the -- the- if you discuss this wi -- Germany, for instance, there still 1s this not anti-Semitism, not Hitlerism, or anything, but what basically in German\u2019s eye, my wife will -- like we could have -- like a -- [indecipherable] sometimes too arrogant, and with this arrogance there comes this prejudice, or they say this guy is this or that. The -- some people have certain traits, Jews have certain traits, some of them not too good, and some are good traits. I always point out on TV when somebody is Jewish. And my wife asked me one time, \u201cWhy do you think that he is Jewish?\u201d Not because of her [indecipherable] had to impress her, but I think the children should -- they -- that\u2019s one part of the learning process, that you can be proud of some people -- when it\u2019s a criminal that\u2019s being shown on TV that is Jewish, or -- certainly not. But I want to point out that people who invented the -- a good example, in 19 -- soon after we got married, I was ordered by the army for 10 days to Brussels, from Germany, to go attend the World Fair, and to visit the Soviet pavilion there, and look at some things. And I don\u2019t [indecipherable] and I went the second time with the American joint media, we came from Washington, I came from Heidelburg, and because he didn\u2019t speak German, they said, \u201cTake him under your wings, he\u2019s one of our people,\u201d or -- you know, key people, \u201cand show him around.\u201d [indecipherable] too new to it, you already have some experience with speaking the language.

Well, I had no idea, and they had -- some Jewish organization had the place to become a mechanic or something. And there were [indecipherable] people go to Israel.

And I was a western European, this was the Middle East to me, and -- and -- and in one of the answers the guy said to me -- oh, I said -- why do you not [indecipherable] I said, \u201cWell, too much sand, and too many Arabs. I don\u2019t like hot Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 55 climate.\u201d And he -- he looked at me, and I thought I had to say something, and I said, for a joke, \u201cAnd too many Jews.\u201d And I thought at that moment the guy was going to throw me out of the office. But I -- I meant it as a joke. But too hot, and too much sand, that was one of the things I really meant. In short, I wasn\u2019t interested in going to Israel, but he tried to push me. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t go, and -- but -- but th-the worst thing I did was when he asked me, \u201cWhat are you going to do then?\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, I -- I try to go to the United States.\u201d I told you that once before. \u201cWell, have you got paper?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to get paper.\u201d And -- \u201cFrom whom?\u201d I said, \u201cI located a cousin of my father.\u201d Apparently he is -- he was rich, because he had to have some money to sponsor somebody, and everybody at the time tried to go the United States, not just Jews, eastern Europeans who didn\u2019t want to go back to Poland, or somewhere. And he said, \u201cSuppose you don\u2019t get the paper to go? What are you going to do then?\u201d Well, I thought about staying in Brussels. I also had a quite nice girlfriend, and -- was 12 years older than myself, a teacher, but that wasn\u2019t the main reason. I still wanted to go United States, and make a new life for myself. And I already had tasted American life with the young men I was with in Germany. They had a big influence, really, on me. Clean cut guys who already knew something about war, and had traveled, and seen Europe, an-and a lot of other thing. Well, United States [indecipherable]. So, when the guy said, \u201cSuppose you don\u2019t get your papers?\u201d Well, I said -- he was -- he was [indecipherable] \u201cIll go back to Germany.\u201d And I said back to Germany, because that\u2019s where I came from, where I knew a lot of people, my parents had friends who were not Jewish. And when I said go on back USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 56 to Germany, he said, \u201cHow can you go back to Germany? The land did this for you.\u201d I said, \u201cThe land that some people did to me and my par -- my family.\u201d Well, we disagreed, and again, like I said, he was going to then throw me out for sure, but he didn\u2019t. And I was serious, but today I would say I would have made a mistake, because for a Jew to live in Germany, like I said before, it\u2019s different than living, a Jew, here. I would take real offense if I heard them all Nazi talk, and I have, in the military, on the -- being American uniform, and understanding German, I overheard many things that people said, in outdoor caf\u00e9, or what -- someplace."

Was a distant relative of mine, cousin of my father, I had never met before. But he turned out to be a rich man, but not very generous, because I came to United States with 10 dollars in my pocket, he did not pay -- want to pay for my ticket on the ship, which would have been about a hundred dollars, or so. So I went in person to his home in New London, Connecticut. I thanked him, and send him every year, for Rosh Hashanah, a card. But he didn\u2019t answer. He really didn\u2019t want any responsibilities. I felt -- I felt, I didn\u2019t say so, but I -- that if I -- this -- I had been in his place, and a young boy comes over, missed out on a cation, has nobody, I send him back to school, maybe -- possibly through college, and if he want to [indecipherable] his money back for college, say, \u201cLook, you can pay me back when you can.\u201d But he -- this was not the case, and there was also one of the reasons why I went into U.S. army. I want to be on my own, and as it turned out, I don\u2019t have to have to say thank you to anybody. I just did it on myself, I wasn\u2019t dependent on anybody. But one other lucky thing happened in Bozdoltz when I was sitting in a -- a sidewalk caf\u00e9, having a cup of coffee, was an American sitting next to me, next table. He couldn\u2019t speak French, and I helped him along, asking the waiter some questions. He turned out to be a big businessman from New York, and he involved me in a conversation, and then I told him I waiting to go Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 58 United States, and he said, \u201cWhat are you going to do there?\u201d He offered me a job in his import export business. He owned -- also owned a zipper factory in New York. And he said, \u201cWell, when you get to y -- New York, come and see me, maybe I have a job for you.\u201d It turned out he did have a job for me, and I learned production of zippers, and I worked in -- he really wanted to employ me in his import export business, because I spoke language. I didn\u2019t tell him I was going to go to the army. I would have been drafted anyway, there was still a draft on at the time, and I would have had to serve two years. So he lost me anyway. So instead, I enlisted in the U.S. army for three years, whereas a draft would have been for two years, something like that. This afforded me an opportunity to get a high school diploma, and -- which I did all while working as a soldier, training and so on. And I -- from the time I applied, to the time I started with the U.S. army were about three months. I went to Fort Dix, New Jersey for basic training, and stayed there four months, and then this incident happened with this colonel, I think I might have told that story."

Basically what a young soldier does who first comes in the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 59 army, nothing special. Well, out of this, based on the points you win, through the months, I got the highest points, and was named soldier of the month. That meant having the honor of sitting in the colonel\u2019s office, on Saturday morning when there was no training, and answering his telephone, on -- on the -- on his -- yeah, outside -- sit -- sitting outside the colonel\u2019s office, with the adjutant, who was a captain. At that time the colonel was reading the New York Times, and all of a sudden, very loud he said, when he read the headlines in the New York Times, which said Israel a state, United Nations has voted to welcome Israel into the nations of the free world, or -- and the colonel said to himself, or maybe so everybody could hear it in the office, \u201cGoddamn Jew politics.\u201d Well, the adjutant knew that I was Jewish, the colonel didn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t very much interested in the soldier of the month. To him it was just another soldier answering telephone -- although I did get a certificate from him for that. And he -- I -- I wasn\u2019t sure how I was going to respond to that, he didn\u2019t say this to -- to me, just to himself, expressed something real loud in the office, and I walked out, and I wasn\u2019t going to have the honor of sitting in this man\u2019s outer office. The adjutant came after me, he knew what I was doing, and he knew that I\u2019d understood what the colonel had said. He was very embarrassed, and he asked me to please come back. He didn\u2019t want to make a big issue out of this. I said, \u201cNo, I just came here to the United States, and I admire the freedoms we have here, also freedom of expression, but -- but not improper things like -- like that.\u201d So he underst -- said he understands, but it wasn\u2019t his opinion, and no -- he didn\u2019t think anybody else in the office, just the colonel\u2019s opinion. Well, I said I can understand, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 60 everybody\u2019s entitled to his opinion, but not 1n a position like he is, make a blanket statement like that. So, the final thing was that I did not go back to the office, and in leaving him, he said, \u201cWillner, remember for the rest of your career, that all kinds of people make this world.\u201d And I just remember that sometimes."

            "answer": "| -- I -- I really, at that time, could care less. I mean, I didn\u2019t -- I -- I -- I didn\u2019t think of that I\u2019m afraid of being -- I don\u2019t think that could have happened to me, knowing already what I knew about the U.S. army, that everybody\u2019s pretty much the same, and people are people, there are good ones and bad ones. There\u2019s always a rotten apple somewhere. But there also good apples on top. So, it didn\u2019t bother me. Particularly, I was very con -- not concerned, but aware of the freedom that people had here, and this was part of it. When I finished that basic training, was a battalion at Fort Dix, my luck started. The whole battalion was ordered to Alaska, about 700 men or so, and I was in despair. I thought if I\u2019m going to be in the army, I\u2019m going to use my language background, French or German, or both, but what about Alaska? Besides it\u2019s very cold there. So from my viewpoint, I also had to consider -- which I always considered, giving back something to this country, and I was debating with myself, well maybe I should go to Alaska, like everybody else, but again here\u2019s free speech, I can open my mouth and say I\u2019m better fit for Germany, or France. I can do the army more good, and perform better than being a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 61 soldier. Many soldiers better than I am, they can shoot better, and do this better, that better. And I decided, no, I should not keep my mouth shut. And particularly I thought perhaps, being soldier of the month, maybe somebody remembers me, and they will talk to me, because not normally down in the army that you go and complain [indecipherable] with reason. So I went to see another officer who was in personnel, and I said what I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not norm -- not normally in the habit of making complaints, this not a complaint, a suggestion, I would appreciate look into this. That -- that [indecipherable], as you know, I said, the battalion, infantry battalion is going to Alaska, and I feel that I\u2019m wasting my time, and I\u2019m wasting the army\u2019s time by just being a soldier. The only thing he has to know maybe, to fire some weapon, and I can do that, but I can do much more if I\u2019m 1n a position in -- in Europe someplace. So the United States at that time was all over Europe, except in the east. And so, make the long story short, he didn\u2019t say yes or no, but he said, \u201cYou'll be notified.\u201d I was n-notified the next day that I\u2019m taken off the orders. So that was the first day, it didn\u2019t say I was going to Germany, but then I went around, I was excited. I went, asked some people, some -- most people didn\u2019t know, but then I came up on the sergeant who said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen your name. I think you\u2019re going to Germany.\u201d Well, I -- I was hoping he was right, and it was true. I went to Germany, and on the ship to transport were some other foreign-born people, also in the army, mostly Polish, or Czechs, in total about 10. And when we arrived in Germany, in Bremerhaven, the security people came on board, and they said, \u201cYou, you, and you, and you. You remain here.\u201d There was myself included, another guy from [indecipherable] Germany, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 62 and about seven or eight Poles, and one or two Czechs. And what this was, they were hunting spies. The -- the [indecipherable] Intelligence had gotten information that some of the people who claimed to be refugees from the east, were not -- were from the east, but were not refugees, they pretended to be. They want to get into United States, and spy for Russia, or Poland. But they check everybody out then, including myself. Anybody was fa -- I forgot to say, I was not a citizen at the time. And everybody -- oh -- oh -- amo- among these 10 men, didn\u2019t have American citizenship. The regulation at that time was that anybody who immigrate to United States, who comes 1n, and is of draft age, will serve in the army first. This for all the people who signed papers that they come for permanent residence to United States -- not if you\u2019re visiting here, you -- and you\u2019ve given up your citizenship. I never reclaimed my German citizenship, which I could have. I can go today the German embassy and say, \u201cUnder Hitler I was deprived of a German citizenship, I want it back.\u201d I could have it. I know somebody that did that here. I have no interest in that. They can keep their citizenship after all that. So -- so we were held in Marmuk, Germany, we came in Bremerhaven port, then went by train to Marmuk, Germany. It\u2019s an old German castle. There were no fences or anything again. Not as a prisoner, but just a place to live. And they told us they have to investigate each one of us, and clear us to go to our new assignment."

Never in my Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 63 wildest dreams I would have thought -- 1t wouldn\u2019t have happened if I would have gone to Alaska, and I thought I\u2019d go to Alaska, or go the Far East or something. But -- so I opened my mouth, and I learned my first lesson, you want to get something done, don\u2019t complain about it, go and talk to the right people. Maybe you\u2019ll get a no, like people are re-religious, who think about praying to God, to give them this or that, or -- and then it doesn\u2019t happen. Or like a rabbi once said, here in the military, \u201cWell, God is hearing you, but he just said no.\u201d Well, that\u2019s the way I felt about some of these things, so they say no, say no, but at least I try. I don\u2019t know if you see that little saying on the wall, I\u2019ve had for 25 years. Failures [indecipherable] people are failures. Failures are people who thi -- who thought -- I\u2019m n -- y -- all mixed up now -- who thought and never did. Number [indecipherable] plan yama, but if you don\u2019t do anything, you know, nothing\u2019s going to happen, or you complain about somebody if you don\u2019t complain about -- you go into a store, and you have something to complain about the merchandise, or the sales lady, well don\u2019t talk to her, talk to her supervisor, or to the manager of the place. Get something corrected. So my saying is failures are divided into two classes, those who did and never thought, and those who thought and never did. You thinking about a plan of something [indecipherable] or you do it, otherwise you might as well be talking to the wall. And also [indecipherable] you doing something, to think about it first. I have buil -- built many things which I thought were -- help m -- help me in my sickness, or whatever, and to -- in order to get my shoes on better. It\u2019s harder to get myself dressed, and I\u2019ve become very inventive. The moment I think about something, I start doing it already. But a lot of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 64 things I\u2019ve done, just sitting in a corner, they\u2019re useless. But I did them, so 1t was fun doing them, and the idea to do this, and I pass on the ideas to other people, who were able to help themselves [indecipherable]. So -- and finally -- 1t was about 10 days later, after sitting in [indecipherable], only two people were released to go to their destination, myself and another guy. And all the Poles were kept, because they were pretty sure, they just didn\u2019t know who, that there were spies being infiltrated into the U.S. army in Europe. Okay, that was the start of the Cold War, let\u2019s say, and -- but it was true, there were people who were being infiltrated. It was a good chance for them to do that.

And these people, probably some of them were on the Nazi side [indecipherable] because they lost the war, not on the American side.

                " -- he was a army Intelligence school at Owamagow, Germany. That\u2019s where they have the Passion play, you may have heard about that. And the school had two courses, and I was picked for the criminal investigator\u2019s course. What is this, being a de-de-detective in the army. Which is nice, because you don\u2019t have to wear a uniform, you go out in civilian clothes. So you\u2019re a soldier, I fig-figure for tho -- for two years, and you have a ID that you are a -- a detective, or a criminal investigator in this case [indecipherable], and you have many privileges, including most of the officer\u2019s normally have. Here I was only a private, or a corporal, and I applied for it, and the captain called me 1n, and he said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think you are qualified.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy not, sir?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re too short.\u201d I said, \u201cCaptain, have you ever heard of exceptions?\u201d I thought he was a guy who would cat -- not ask please do this, or do that, or -- I -- I was showing him that I knew what was on. He said, \u201cYeah, well wh-what do -- exception would you have?\u201d \u201cAn exception for height.\u201d I know that the minimum 1s five foot in 0 -- in -- in officer\u2019s school the same thing, but they give a -- a exception. He said, \u201cAnd your English is not that good.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s true, but I can learn very fast.\u201d And [indecipherable] he didn\u2019t want to let me go to school. So at that time, I had this civilian friend, a lady, who was a girlfriend of a colonel, who was higher than the captain, she told him my story, and that the captain had refused let me go to school. And this girl called this captain and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let Willner go to school?\u201d He had some stupid reasons. He himself was a stupid man, and so USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 66 the colonel said, \u201cWell I -- I think he 1s very capable, and I think you should consider him.\u201d He couldn\u2019t tell him what to do, but captains don\u2019t fool around with colonels. And so next thing I know was an orders to come investigator\u2019s school. Very interesting, in the mountains, beautiful, and I became a criminal investigator and they teach you all the things a detective learns. But you deal only with army members, or air force, or navy. And -- so when I finished that, I was assigned to Heidelberg, which is the headquarters for yu -- all U.S. forces in Europe. And in Heidelberg -- it -- it\u2019s the headquarters where there\u2019s staff officers. Well I wasn\u2019t going to be a staff officer, because first of all I wasn\u2019t an officer. Number two, that\u2019s -- you have to know good knowledge of the English language, you had to write reports, staff studies, that wasn\u2019t for me, I knew that. So I didn\u2019t turn out -- I\u2019m going to the right school, and -- well, in Heidelberg. Our captain, the commander, was a Jewish guy by the name of Marcus. He was a lawyer in civilian life, and he was being -- he had been drafted for the army, and he became the commander of the investigation unit. So he was very good. And -- and then he ha -- assigned me to an en -- to a guy who also was Jewish, who had been a police force in Philadelphia. And he was a champion boxer there. Big guy name of Goldstein. And they assigned me to him as his partner. Now in police work you usually will partnership with a policeman that\u2019s already well into it, and Goldstein was not only former policeman, he was big, strong, a bully of a guy, who if you -- he talked to you, pay -- you pay attention. He was a nice person, too. He had himself been a captain, but he was demoted to captain after World War two, because they made many people officers, and after World War two -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 67 "

They were losing the forces, and he was rift. And then they had a deal, when people were rift, could re-enlist in the army, but not as officers, as master sergeant. That\u2019s a ter-ter-terrible come-down. You -- that\u2019s not a proper thing to do in proper management in my opinion, to have people moted up, and then they go down again. But again, that was our system, and when I knew him was a captain, and I was a corporal, so Captain Marcus said, \u201cYou go as -- w -- Goldstein.\u201d And it turned out to be terrific experience, he turned out to be a terrific guy. He was very good investigator, he was very good with criminals. Good interrogator. I really learned a lot. As a matter of fact, he was very courageous guy, and he treated me like -- he taught me thing, and I was very grateful for that. And th -- and then he got into trouble. He was honest, but he had an affair with a German professor\u2019s wife. [indecipherable] been invited the house -- and the German professor was not a Nazi or nothing, nothing to do with, strictly -- so Goldstein did that, and then she was going to divorce him, and marry Goldstein. And she did, finally. I saw them one time in the States. Okay, those things happened there, but -- okay, I working with Goldstein, and -- interesting cases. And -- for instance, a guy [indecipherable] from Heidelberg all of a sudden, came like -- w -- from Paris came a request, they want Heidelberg to send an investigator to Paris that spoke both German and French. German, because he had to operate in a French zone in Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 68 Germany, and the American zone, you had to know German. Not all investigators spoke four language. There was one thing, and the second thing was that he -- yeah, that he spoke French also fluently, and work with the French police in the past. I thought that was great. So I went to Paris. I bought my first car, I bought a surplus Jeep from the army. One thing, but I didn\u2019t have any money. 400 bucks that I pay for that thing. Lot of money in those days. And I put my dog in it -- I always had German Shepherd -- and baggage, and I came to the French border, and the Frenchman said, \u201cWhat -- what do you have in there?\u201d Gasoline, I had four extra cans of gas, because gasoline was expensive 1n those days. You had to buy German, but we were entitled to American gas [indecipherable], and I had four jerry cans full. And the French customs officer, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s in there?\u201d He knew what was in there, gas. \u201cYou cannot import any gas to France.\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s my gas, not for sale, and selling on black market. I have to report to Paris, and I just bought this Jeep, and I was told that it was difficult to get gas, and also more expensive. So I took four [indecipherable].\u2019\u201d\u2019 You know, you cannot take [indecipherable].\u201d That was just plain harassment. They were jealous. Then I said, \u201cWill you give me a statement that you don\u2019t let military allies -- that you won\u2019t let me cross the border with four cans of gas? What big deal is this, four cans of gas?\u201d [indecipherable]. He said yeah. Also, they -- he wanted me to leave it there for him to sell Black Market, they were [indecipherable]. So I -- I got upset, and I drove my car to a ditch. He said, \u201cWhat are you driving it there for?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m making phone call, telephone there.\u201d But I went to the ditch, I took my four cans of gas, and I poured them Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 69 into the ditch. I filled my gas tank first, one more time. And the French came up, \u201cAh, if somebody throws a -- throw the match down there, and going to be fire,\u201d and all this. But I was really upset, and th -- this guy, he got upset. That\u2019s what I wanted. I wasn\u2019t going to leave those four cans there. I made it to Paris, but I might as well not have made it. 20 miles out of Paris, I was looking at my gauge, and was at the end [indecipherable], if worse comes to worse, I would have gotten the French gas, but my car start to be on fire. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not a mechanic, I don\u2019t know anything. I\u2019m not interested in mechanics. I -- I -- I know my car\u2019s out of gas, or little -- couple little things. My wife the same way, my old son the same way, and he should know about mechanics in helicopters. Well, it started burning, and I thought I had a fire extinguisher, couldn\u2019t find it. I said, \u201cLet the he -- damn thing burn, I want to get to Paris.\u201d 40 more miles I hitchhiked, but I figured, with the dog, it\u2019s going to be difficult, German Shepherd. But I get picked up, and some drove me into Paris. Not only drove me to Paris, but drove me to the place I was supposed to go. So okay, that\u2019s that. In Paris I had my greatest time. I figured I can pick up on my education, and the army is going to pay for it. They encouraged that, they - and the GI bill, and I was assigned to the French FBI [indecipherable]. They had several [indecipherable], and I wound up with a very nice inspector, who taught me all [indecipherable] thing. Basically, the job was, if an American did something wrong in Paris, the French arrested him, and then they didn\u2019t know what to do with him. They turned him over to the Americans. So they decided to have somebody permanently up there -- not always, call somebody someplace. And got the job, and I -- they paid for a Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 70 room, the army paid for nice hotel room in a [indecipherable] from the Arc of Triumph, and the owner of the hotel -- hotel, liked my dog.

Instead of doing criminal investigation, I was going to do congressional investigation from our [indecipherable] here. And they needed qualified or -- investigators for that, partially speaking the language. What happened, congressional investigations in washing, if you had a son who was the army during the invasion of France, or in Germany, and he was found missing in action -- there were many of them, thousands, but they had also quite a few hundred who deserted, who didn\u2019t want to fight, and who got married to other women, local women. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 81 Had already wife in the United States, maybe children. And the last that we knew of them, he never showed up, he disappeared from his unit. So, a guy didn\u2019t show up in his unit, that could happen he got lost, or had a girl from someplace, then he was AWOL. AWOL is absent without leave. He would get some small punishment for that, but they cannot give you more than 30 days in jail, unless the guy stays a-away, excuse me, a year or something, then it\u2019s desertion, it becomes automatically desertion. So, congressional investigation demanded the parents, let\u2019s say, had the son missing in France, he was never found. We have cemeteries over there, and usually people got buried in our American cemeteries. We do not have cemeteries in Germany. It\u2019s not a fact well known, because our law says we will not bury American soldiers in enemy territory if they get killed there. So if they got killed in Germany, they had to transport it back to France, or -- or Holland, or Belgium. Okay, so this congressional investigations were usually initiated by parents, who went to their congressman, say, \u201cHey, do something about it. We want to get our son home in a casket [indecipherable] buried -- or even buried over there, but w -- what -- know what happened to him.\u201d So you could get people buried, not in Germany, but in France, Belgium. So whatever the family decided. I had the -- this cousin, who before the war, came to United States, he got killed in France, has a grave there in a military cem -- an American military cemetery, and I visit his grave, send the picture to his parents. They were originally from Germany. And then they ask me that the government told us we can have his body brought back here, buried a local cemetery, or have it -- him stay in a French cemetery. I said, \u201cLeave him there. He\u2019s dead. I know y -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 82 how you feel about him, but if you bring him here, what have you accomplished? You go more often to the cemetery, you feel worse. Sometimes gotta finish -- the war is finished, you can\u2019t go on and on with these things.\u201d And -- he was the only son. I said, \u201cYou had to -- you paid a high price for escaping Germany, came to United States, but that\u2019s the way it goes.\u201d If I had to make a choice, my family [indecipherable] 10 members of the family, and what I\u2019m po -- proposing 1s that we do a certain thing, but 10 -- out of 10, eight are -- eight [indecipherable] took them all alive. I know this in advance, you may still do it, or you may not do anything at all, because you\u2019re a coward, or you say this won\u2019t work, or -- anyway, So in the -- in these congressional investigations, like I said, I - we had to go further than the cemetery, the cemetery was only the last instance [indecipherable], or in the United States. And the deal was -- my job was to find out from local people, if there was an American, or more, killed in that area. They usually knew because the German shot him there, they were not going to bury him. And then the French fo -- found him, and they make a local grave out of it, right in the cemetery, bury him. So I said to this guy, \u201cDo you have any unmarked graves here, where you don\u2019t know whether they are Americans or German?\u201d He said yes, and that\u2019s the way we usually worked it. If they said yes, if they were sometimes a mound, not totally un- underground, they would say, \u201cThere a hundred soldiers buried here,\u201d or, \u201c\u201cThere a hundred French soldiers buried here, a hundred American buried here.\u201d Or German troops with Americans. We went to the extreme, our country, to -- which I -- I think is -- was right, even this point. These guys, they died for their country, and they have a right USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 83 to be properly take care of. So -- and finally -- so what I finally [indecipherable] hundred guys that the farmer told me, \u201cI don\u2019t know, we -- we just picked up these guys after the battle was over, and they were dead, and we threw them all in a hole, covered up.\u201d I said, \u201cAre they Germans, or Americans?\u201d He said, \u201cI think they\u2019re mixed, they [indecipherable]. Sometime that is only German. I said, \u201cOkay, we got to open this grave up.\u201d That wasn\u2019t my job. They had what they call graves registration teams. They were Americans, comprised of guys, and linguists, and dentists sometimes with dental charts, and what was the other thing? Well, may -- they -- if I thought, or somebody else thought, among those hundred Germans, may be two Americans we\u2019re looking for, they decided to dig them all up, and sometimes that the uniforms, they were a mess. But fortunately, I didn\u2019t have anything to do with that, I just had to investigation, and -- and then report, and then they took action on what to do about it. So I had this place with about a hundred Germans, and I said to this farmer, \u201cAre you sure they\u2019re no Americans?\u201d Because I got after action reports from the army, before I [indecipherable]. They said the 75\" infantry company went through there, through the area, and I had a map -- had their all map f -- when they went to the war, and they send out two scouts, to find out where the Germans [indecipherable], and those two scouts never came back. I have reason to assume they got killed, if they were taken prisoner, and they could have [indecipherable] as prisoners, but prisoners we usually found alive. So, here already hundred or so Germans, and they decided to dig up. When I said I come back in two or three days, when you should be finished, and then -- and they had not archaeologists, but Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 84 they had dentists sometime, and [indecipherable] soldiers. And they couldn\u2019t, they were bloody and rotten already. But the teeth, you could tell. And the other thing was dogtags. Had the dogtags, you have two of them, and take one off and take it with you, to report that this man was killed."

                " [had a great time, I found my personal -- a lot of satisfaction, being successful, had a free hand, my boss was so good that I went out in faraway places, and the weekends were coming up, I would have liked to be home, but I liked to see other places, too. Had a Jeep available, and a driver. Normally a team consists of three people, one officer, one sergeant or corporal, and one dri -- drivers were these Polish guys who went [indecipherable] United States, they employ them as guard, or driver. So I -- I was operating [indecipherable] also very independent, and the boss we had, he kept the [indecipherable].

And we had to have all our uniforms in a closet, neat, pressed, insignia and all that. And it had to Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 87 be open, not locked. And we went about our jobs while these guys were looking our stuff. And I had my hung up properly, and everything cleaned, and shoes shined, you play soldier again. And then captain -- that evening, Captain Marcus called me in. He said, \u201cWillner, apparently the general knows you, he heard of you. You do [indecipherable] sharp here, but you got one problem. The question was why you not an officer.\u201d I told him same story, you have to be a citizen first, and you cannot become commander of American troops if you\u2019re not a citizen, only if you\u2019re doctor, a chaplain, or -- you can\u2019t be foreign -- not [indecipherable] foreigner.\u201d So he said, \u201cYeah, but he looked particularly through your stuff, he wanted to see what -- how you keep your stuff. He [indecipherable] nothing -- anything about your stuff, but I found you -- you -- he put me i-1n a bad shape. I -- he -- the general asked me what grade I have by now, and I told him sergeant. And we open up your locker, and you find corporal stripes on there. That\u2019s one less stripe [indecipherable] there are three. Why is that?\u201d I said, \u201cCaptain Marcus, I tell you frankly. I feel like a nothing with just two stripes. I -- I -- I decided I\u2019m going to put my stripes on when I have three stripes, to amount to something.\u201d He know -- I was a good [indecipherable] Captain Marcus, I could say that, and he laughed, and, \u201cLook, if you don\u2019t have them on by tomorrow morning, I\u2019m going to take your three stripes away, you -- youll be nothing but a private.\u201d [indecipherable] and what -- then I wrote a letter, I think I can get [indecipherable]. I wrote a letter to the general, and I said it\u2019s not normal to -- for a sergeant to write to a general, and has permission from his commanding officer, and I do not have permission from my commanding officer, he doesn\u2019t know Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 88 about it, but I\u2019d like to explain something. And what he -- what I explain 1s maybe not acceptable to you either. It was not acceptable to Captain Marcus. I told him that I think not because I earned them, or I\u2019m capable of doing the job, I just thought th-three stripes were better than two stripes, it\u2019s a higher rank. A lot of guys had two stripes, but [indecipherable]. And he laughed, he -- okay. Captain Marcus took care of it, have me put them on. I know. I had the same thing happen to officer\u2019s school. You get promoted if you're a private or -- or is a [indecipherable]. Okay, my three year -- now comes the important part. My three year less -- lesson -- enlistment was up. I had learned English better, I have got myself a high school diploma. The army had arrangements with state of New York board of education, that for military people who needed a high school diploma, they can take courses, or they can take a final examination for high school, and the state of New York will issue a high school diploma, even if you have not graduated from high school, provided you pass the exam. So I looked at, and asked the guy that was in charge of it, looked at this and see if I am -- where I was weak. I always felt weak in -- in m -- n -- math, or English maybe. I looked at it, it didn\u2019t look that difficult to me. And I said, \u201cI'll take the exam without studying, and if I don\u2019t pass, Ill start studying [indecipherable].\u201d I took a 10 hour examination, five sections each, and passed with flying colors. I was so happy. And that qualified me to take another test to become an officer, because you have to be -- and the other things involved, first of all, because the Korean war was going on, they accepted people with less education to get them to officer\u2019s school without a college degree. But you had to have a high school diploma, and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 89 to be a citizen. So I had the high school diploma, but I didn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t a citizen yet. And with the -- I explain that, an-and in past a system has been developed, it also has to have college education [indecipherable] army. They used to have a time where you can get your college education in the army. The University of Maryland, Virginia, they taught courses in the Pentagon, and some other place. And they -- so that\u2019s what -- what was I go -- what I was going to do. But I was up 19 -- three years, and I saved up all my leave time, which was 30 days a year, I never took leave, never went on vacation, and Captain Marcus knew this, and he said, \u201cWhen you go to Paris, and you have to stay over the weekend, in the arm -- army\u2019s expense, because something ready for you, you are spending time working with other soldiers that are taking the weekend off, going someplace. And I will make a special deal, which I\u2019m also as commanding officer. I know you saving up your leave time for other things more serious. So when you in Paris, on Saturday, you don\u2019t have to come back, you want to stay there you stay there,\u201d and this is -- I -- he -- he -- commanding officer could give you le -- leave time, three days, no more. It was only three days you had to take [indecipherable] leave, and 1t was just at his- it\u2019s like an award they -- they gave away three day passes to guys who did good jobs, who wanted to see their families. And so I had 90 days, the agreement with [indecipherable] was I go back to New York, I go to the -- get my citizenship, and the requirement was that, when you get a citizenship if you\u2019re in the army, it\u2019s three years, if you\u2019re a civilian, five years, unless you\u2019re the wife of a military, and he 1s all -- overseas, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 90 and he can -- the wife can get it two years, I think, because they prefer to be citizens, to protect the pe -- United States.

And my knowledge was limited except to what I experienced. He had some political questions, too.

So when I came to New Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 97 York, my next move was to get in front of the officer selection board, and I had my papers, and I went to Governor\u2019s Island. There was the headquarters of the first U.S. army. And I went in there, and told them what the story was, and they said they have selection boards only once or twice a month. I said, \u201cThat might be trouble, so w -- when\u2019s the next selection board meeting?\u201d And he didn\u2019t know. And I was lucky again, there\u2019s meeting next morning, but I was not on the list of people to be interviewed. So they added me to it. And they say this 1s a special, and -- so I came in front of the board, there were nine officers, and there were about 20 or so people to [indecipherable]. So I timed these people, see how long this takes. Five minutes. And I went in there, I was still going on for half an hour. And I thought -- not like here 1s interesting, or -- I thought I\u2019m not going to make it. They\u2019re asking real hard questions. And nothing against me, they were very nice, but you -- you are nervous when you go. This is my fu-future, and now I have everything, now I got to go to school, and then I worry about getting through school. So, they ask me all kind of questions and I answer. Then this thing was finished, I was the last one, I had to take the ferry back from Ellis Island to New York -- Manhattan. I got in a ferry, and one major was on the ferry, and there was an aboard, and he said hello [indecipherable] far away. And then I decided I\u2019m going to make a move. I know it\u2019s not legal for him to tell me, but I made [indecipherable]. I\u2019ve got to know, I won\u2019t be able to sleep. People had told me I will be notified in about a week. And the way this thing worked up there, I know they asked me a lot of questions they didn\u2019t ask the other people. They were concerned, I was a foreigner, who was going to be in charge of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 98 American troops, maybe with a career, and into combat. They wanted someho -- body they can trust, and they -- so when I left, I didn\u2019t know whether am I going to make it or not. So I find this major on the boat, on the ferry. I go over to him, and I say, \u201cExcuse me sir, I know it\u2019s illegal, I know you cannot give me the answer, but I\u2019m going to ask you anyway, because I\u2019m so damn nervous. I\u2019ve been waiting for this for a long time [indecipherable] problems, they all got straightened out, and you got 15 guys -- nine guys- nine guys, and nobody took more than five minutes, one guy took 15 minutes, and I was in there at least half an hour. I like to know where I stand. I know you cannot tell me whether I made it, cause they told me I\u2019d be notified. And -- can you give me an indication?\u201d I wa -- atsfa -- I tell you, the guy\u2019s nice, he will say something. And he said, \u201cWell, I cannot tell you anything. But you can go home, and tell your folks you did all right. I know that you did all right.\u201d And so I was notified, and they did another nice thing, they changed my order, I didn\u2019t have to go back to Europe and pick up the stuff I left there. They sent it back, and the army immediately sent me to Fort Dix. I went to a prep school first, for leadership training. So I graduated -- and leadership training school was not mainly for officers -- for future officers, but for future sergeants. For the guys who get higher, but need more leadership training, that was eight weeks. But they added the officer candidates to it, and -- because the army say, \u201cIf they cannot make that course, they sure as hell cannot make the officer\u2019s course.\u201d So I did that, I did all right, and I made two great acquaintance there, which were important in my life. One was my best military friend, who was not Jewish, but who had also come from England, so he was USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 99 military. His father was American who went to England, married a British woman, and he was a sergeant [indecipherable]. He became very good friend. He got married while he was in school, when he was not allowed to get married. With my money. He\u2019s -- asked me, one day he called up, \u201cI got to get married. I don\u2019t want to lose this woman, can I borrow money from you?\u201d Remember this, that a lot of guys borrow money, but we never borrowed from [indecipherable]. I said, \u201cHow much?\u201d He said, \u201c300 dollars.\u201d I say, \u201cSure.\u201d I send him 300 dollars, he got married, he had three boys. But then we started this school together, and went to Philadelphia, from Fort Dix, on the weekend, to go to a -- to go to an orchestra, I believe, philharmonic. And a famous guy was there, a British conductor, sir -- sir -- sir -- in the military they got free tickets. So we got together four guys, went to Philadelphia. On the way back, a drunken guy drove into our car, he backed out, high speed. I was asleep in the back seat, I wound up in the hospital. I was five weeks in the hospital by a concussion, broken nose [indecipherable]. And so I didn\u2019t go to the course because I was atained in the hospital, but my best friend went. So, I got healed, and then I\u2019m [indecipherable] there to the doctor, my nose was going back to the side like this, it broke in two places. And the specialist -- military specialist, didn\u2019t want to correct it. He had made a mistake and not set 1t back when it happened. And he said, \u201cWell, what do you want to be, a Clark Gable?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cI just want a straight nose again.\u201d I -- I -- and he said -- and start pushing on my nose, it started bleeding, and the nurse shook her head. When he was out, she said, \u201cDon\u2019t take that doctor.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d I said, \u201cto me, he\u2019s more like a veterinarian, or in Germany, they call a -- a horse doctor. I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 100 never se-seen anything like that.\u2019 And he told me to come in my quit. He said, \u201cYou still want it done, you can be -- come to my clinic.\u201d And he want to do this again. I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m refusing now to be touched by you. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d To make a long story short, a year later, Walter Reed Army Hospital operated, plastic surgeon, went put it back where it was. Very nice [indecipherable]. He was just -- just a jerk. Then I went to day school, and we weren\u2019t on the same class -- every class was 250 people, and my friend was ahead of me, but because he got married, his weekends were spent with his wife, he didn\u2019t study too hard, and he flunked a couple of courses. Not -- he was intelligent, but he -- he didn\u2019t study. So they had a deal in the school, if a guy is a good guy, he\u2019s -- if he\u2019s -- they think he\u2019s capable of making [indecipherable], they gave him a second chance, they started him again the second time, beginning of the course, we had three months in already, and he flunked.

He\u2019s the top academic guy in the class, and the second guy is the top athletic guy, who wins all the military stakes mishum sports, and stuff like. So the second guy got called up, and all of a sudden they call my name on the stage, and I was number 121 in line to get the bars, and only the first two get their bars pinned on by the general, and the others, somebody else pins them on. I was called on stage, and we supposed to complete the prize to have the bars pinned on by a general because it was stated that I was the first naturalized citizen after the war who became an army officer. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 103 Not only that, that I was cited for having done -- worked the hardest to become an officer. And then the general made a joke, he said, \u201cAre you f -- did you follow your or-orders from your immediate superiors not to go on weekends to a hotel and study -- sit ina room, but just to go out and have some fun?\u201d I said no. I was ordered one time, because my colleagues reported me -- we had what in -- what they called buddy ratings. 24 guys who live with you on one floor, had to report on each other what kind of -- criticized you, or -- so you could think about your -- they called them buddy ratings. And our instructor would look at them, and I was reported by quite a few of them for not going on leave on weekends, which they wanted to, because it\u2019s very hard, the studies, and some guys cracked up, and went out -- went out of the school, they couldn\u2019t take it, it was too -- too- too strict, and in my case, I took leave like e-everybody else, went downtown like everybody else, but didn\u2019t go to a movie, or didn\u2019t date any girls. I went to hotel room, and I studied. So, at the time we had, like I said, a couple of people that need psychiatric treatment, because they just couldn\u2019t take it. But that\u2019s the part of becoming an officer, th- taking a lot of stress and th -- and to me that didn\u2019t mean anything, I had gone through a lot more than that. But I need to study. I figure if \u2019'm going to make it, I need to study. Physical part was no problem. So I study -- they reported me that I didn\u2019t take it easy on weekends, that I went to a hotel room and studied. On Monday the senior instructor had me in the office, and said, \u201cYou got to stop this. I don\u2019t want you [indecipherable] about it.\u201d Anyway, that was one. So when I -- here we were on a stage, and I was the third one to get the bars pinned on by a general. And then we had to say good-bye, salute every USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 104 officer that was our instructor, were about a dozen or so from my class. And the way it worked, you got your diploma, shook hands with a general, and he put the bars on rikey, and then went on to the next guy, and then went from rank to rank, lower, lower.

And this was not just me, but everybody who was Black, or Jewish, or some other foreign [indecipherable] came from foreign country, maybe, or his parents gave him [indecipherable] name. He was picking on them, and tried to get them kicked out of school, including me. In my case, it was another story. He used my being foreign-born, and having gone through the Holocaust, by saying when -- during a coun-counseling session, \u201cCandi-Candidate Willner, if you become an officer, and the army sends you to Germany, wouldn\u2019t that be very bad that you hate those Germans, and you -- because they killed your parents, and your family, and wouldn\u2019t that be very bad for the army, send you to Germany, and you would have to put up with those people, who did this? You probably hate the Germans.\u201d I said, \u201cMajor, I don\u2019t hate the Germans. I -- that\u2019s the only people are responsible for what happened, but I don\u2019t put everybody in the same pot. I -- those who have done bad things, I don\u2019t want any part of them, but there\u2019s Germans - many Germans who are good. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be here today.\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t understand you,\u201d he said, \u201cI -- I -- I -- you must hate the Germans.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 105 hate the Germans.

If the army sends me to Germany, I\u2019ll conduct myself the way is expected of me, and I immedi -- I had to keep my personal feelings to myself, in the interest of the army [indecipherable].\u201d Well, he kept on and on, digging, but he didn\u2019t get anywhere wi-with me, and he apparently tried to talk me into saying something that I hated Germans because what happened, and therefore I would not be a good representative of the United States Army, or United States, in Germany, because my hatred."

I said, \u201cNot with our -- in our democracy, but there are people -- not the country, that would do bad things if not properly supervised, officers included.\u201d To wit, Lieutenant Calley in Korea -- in Viet -- in Vietnam, who killed women and children, who went to jail for a few years, but in my opinion, that -- the case of Lieutenant Calley was that his superior officer, a captain, should have been punished more than Lieutenant Calley, because he was responsible for him, he knew what he was doing, and he should have stopped him. And he should have made a supply officer, not the combat officer up front, where he could kill. Give him a job where he doesn\u2019t need his rifle. And during class on how to treat prisoner of war, because the war in Korea was going on then, they gave us a case in school, which they wanted us to solve. They say suppose you were in combat, and you take Chinese, or Korean prisoners. And the day before you attacked, and you went in Chinese position, and some of you -- your friends got captured by the Chinese, or the Koreans. And you knew that they got captured alive, and the next day you\u2019re on the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 108 attack -- we -- we Americans are on the attack, and we overrun the Chinese position, and you find the guys they were taken prisoners the day before shot in the head, their hands bound behind them. In other words, the Chinese shot the prisoners, your best friends, your comrade. What would b-be your reaction? Well, we had different answers. When I - came my turn, and the instructor asked me, well, somebody said we kill them, and it -- it happened actually, that they got so upset about it during combat, that when they found this -- this really happened that they got killed, with their hands bound behind their back, that our troops went wild, and they took no Chinese prisoners, they shot them. Or in one case, they had a few prisoners, and the lieutenant said to the sergeant, \u201cTake him back.\u201d Take him back was generally understood to a prisoner enclave, an enclosure to take them out of combat, and keep in a prison camp. But in this particular case, this officer always said, when he said to the sergeant take him back, he meant take him behind the hill, then execute him. It happened. So he asked me, what would you do, this happened to your unit? You find out the sergeant take these guys over the hill, and you find out -- not your order, but you find the sergeant did this on his own. What would you do? Let it go on? And I said no. I would court mar -- if -- if a b -- I would prefer charges against the sergeant after the battle, and have him court martialed. \u201cIs that -- that is the proper procedure, isn\u2019t it,\u201d I said, \u201cin the United States.\u201d The instructing officer said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s correct, that is our policy, but in doing this, you will destroy the fighting spirit of your troops, and you have a morale problem, because you\u2019re stopping guys to get even with the other side, who did that. And my answer would be close your eyes to it,\u201d -- and this USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 109 was not the school\u2019s solution, this -- this was this instructor. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s my -- my solution, not the school\u2019s solution. And if you court martial a guy after the battle 1s over, your -- your -- the rest of your troops probably won\u2019t fight the way they\u2019re supposed to, because you\u2019re doing something against your own people.\u201d I say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we fight by the rules of the c -- Geneva convention, which are very humane, and a prisoner is supposed to be taken back and put into an enclosure. When the war is finished, he\u2019s released.\u201d And if I have a problem with the morale of the troops, my job would be that after the battle is over -- during the battle you can\u2019t do anything, you\u2019re in the heat of the battle. You can\u2019t say that shooting\u2019s [indecipherable] stop this, or because you don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t do this. But after the battle is over, the next day or something, after everybody already calmed down, say, \u201cWell, this what I witnessed yesterday. This not the way we fight a war, we don\u2019t execute prisoners, and I don\u2019t want to see this happen again.\u201d Not threaten -- threaten him with a court martial, but just imply that you will take stern action if this [indecipherable] our side does it. And I finished up saying this discussion back and forth, they were back and forth. I say, \u201cIf we do this, we\u2019re not better than they are, even that\u2019s revenge. And you don\u2019t do -- you don\u2019t kill a prisoner.\u201d So that [indecipherable]"

I -- \u2019'm sure he was stopped after this case, my case, which became more of less, not public, but the officers talked among them and say this guy shouldn\u2019t be able to do that. Or I\u2019m sure there were actually three majors, and the others were lower ranking, and two majors were for me, and just this one guy against. And the two majors were for me were -- one was USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 11] like I said, a war hero, and a -- and the other was a very fine gentleman too, and they -- they ask me sometimes some questions, but not in detail, and they thought I was an asset. So anyway, at -- at graduation they were all lined up, and I stepped down when I had my bars on, and you said good-bye to each one of the officers who were your instructors, and- and saluted. And you were in the military, where you turned right, and formed a line. You salute, you shook hands, turn right again, turn left again in front of the next guy, about a dozen guys, and here was my major who [indecipherable]. I made two steps instead of one step, and I stepped past him. I didn\u2019t salute him, and I didn\u2019t shake hands, or say anything to him. And I know that a lot of people watching, a lot of people knew my dislike -- or his dislike, that we had a problem, but that I -- and I figured I was a -- an commissioned officer now, although I was inferior to him, he -- that I was -- I wanted to do that, I really -- I had planned this, I -- I didn\u2019t just do that on the spur of the moment. I said I\u2019m not going to salute. On the outside, I salute him, it\u2019s required, but here -- I won\u2019t make an issue out of it. And nobody\u2019s going to say anything during a big ceremony. We had a couple hundred people there. And particularly since I was cited [indecipherable] stage. And I\u2019m sure the general didn\u2019t know about it. He might have asking question afterwards, why didn\u2019t this lieutenant salute, or -- but they were too preoccupied with things there. And -- so I figured well, everybody saw this, and the people that knew about it, they wonder what happened once the doors open, everybody was free to go, this guy would come after me and tell me that was a bad thing. Some guys came over to me and said, \u201cBoy, I take my hat off for you. I know what\u2019s going on.\u201d And I said -- he never USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 112 came to me, and he let me go. And I figure if he does, then he will make case of it, but otherwise he -- maybe you\u2019 ve taught this lesson. And I always hoped that in the milikin -- military career I would run across him so I could really tell him off. I never did. I don\u2019t know what happened to him, I don\u2019t -- so that was then.

                " No, I didn\u2019t go to Korea, I went to -- everyone went to a specialized school after you become a second lieutenant. You go to -- this was an infantry officer\u2019s school, that was your basic instruction, whereas other guys went to F-Fort Knox, if they wanted to be in tanks. They would then be tank officers. And there was another school to become an artillery officer, and one more to be -- infantry, artillery, tanks, and -- yeah, that was it. Oh yeah, and -- and th-the four -- and the other branch was branch [indecipherable], you were assigned to a branch afterward. You could be assigned to a branch right away, then you went to your branch school to be specialized. You were an ordinance officer, which meant repairing tanks or guns. You went to the ordinance school at -- it\u2019s outside Washingham. In my case, I was trained as a combat infantry officer, but I wasn\u2019t specialized as such. I -- I -- my desire was to go into Intelligence because I spoke languages, and had served with [indecipherable]. So my desire was really to catch spies, people who were stealing our secrets, in this case the Russians were good at that, and our side had to find out who these people were to catch them. And that was the intent, that was my plan, to be a counter-Intelligence officer. But that\u2019s not what you become right USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 113 away in the army, you become an Intelligence officer, period. You do first Intelligence work. Not secretly maybe, and sit in the staff, or in an office. And so that\u2019s what I intended to be. And I went for six months then, to two schools -- actually eight months. No, six and a half -- six and a half months. I went to Fort Lee, Virginia, and I wound up at a course in there I had not intended to take. The last course I took was aerially -- a- aerially supply. Aerially supply meant for the paratroopers who come -- some out of airplanes, but not that. But to -- we supply these guys by air, too. Somebody was surrounded in a battle, like it happened in World War two. They needed guns, ammunition, first aid, doctors, so they would have to jump over an area where these guys were surrounded, and therefore you needed aerially supplied. So I took that course, and what it amounted to is jet plane that could be opened up from the rear -- by the rear door, not on the side, and supplies were stacked up in the plane, and you had to shove them out. And they either came down by parachute over a target, or the plane flew -- flew so low, just above ground, like a couple of feet, and would had to be a skillful pilot, and these -- aerially supply officer would be inside the plane to see to it that it got pushed out on time, over the target, not over the enemies side, that he would get our supplies, and so I took that course. When I was finished [indecipherable] I wanted to go to Germany. I was called to an office in the Pentagon, and there was an officer of Chinese ancestry. He was civilian Intelligence officer, he turned out to be a former aide de camp of General Wainwright, who was the -- we called Vinegar Joe, who fought in Asia during World War two. And very famous, he was in charge there. And this guy that talked to me in the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 114 Pentagon was his aide, Chinese American. He was aide during World War two, and he spoke Chinese, and he was at the young age of 27, a lieutenant colonel, because a general\u2019s aide. And when I met him, he was civilian Intelligence officer working for the army, and he was my sponsor, if you like. And they wanted me to go to Korea. Of course, that\u2019s where the action was at that time, and I told him that I would like to go to Germany, because I know the language, and he said to me that, \u201cOh, you\u2019re not married now, and every officer has to go initially to Korea.\u201d The war was still going on, we didn\u2019t know when it was going to be finished. \u201cAnd it\u2019s better to go now while you\u2019re not married, because you may be thinking about getting married, and then you have to leave your wife at home for a year. But go now while you\u2019re single, have a good time, if you\u2019re not in combat.\u201d And I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He said he\u2019II guarantee me that I go to Germany wh- after I come back from Korea. I\u2019m glad I took his advice. I could have insisted I go Germany, when -- talk to somebody else and -- but he appreciate I didn\u2019t go over his head, and made a big thing out of it. I went to Korea, and he saw to it that I got a position in Korea which was -- called for an officer with th-two grades higher than I was, a major End of Tape Five, Side A Beginning Tape Five, Side B ",
                " -- went on a troopship, and on the troopship to go into Korea, we went first to Okinawa, and I was given a job on the ships as a -- being a compartment commander, and the troops sleep on the troopship four -- four beds high, o-one on top of another, filled USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 115 with people. We had a lot of problems, guys getting seasick, including myself, but -- and messing up the place, and then other people get sick, well, I took some action by having- having teams go topside, get fresh air, go down and change -- put another [indecipherable] and I kept my place very clean.

So anyway, it was a go -- I -- I came there, bu -- good thing -- also I had my dog on board, which was illegal by the army. The army said no pets to Korea. And I didn\u2019t have anybody, no parents, no -- and I didn\u2019t know what to do with my dog, I -- somebody advised me, \u201cTake him to Seattle, to the port, see the captain of the ship, of the troop transport, because he 1s navy, you are army.

That actually is a thing I really didn\u2019t talk about because it\u2019s too long, and too -- too involved, and very personal, I think, it -- what one goes through when you\u2019re lonely, or when you have everybody killed in the family. And I was just like -- the dog to me was like a member of the family, and there were two things that I did to remain sane, actually, and to -- not to -- I couldn\u2019t stay behind closed doors was one thing. I all -- I -- even today I leave the doors open in my house. I go to the toilet, I don\u2019t close the door if it\u2019s just my family that\u2019s in the house -- not when there are other people, because I don\u2019t like closed doors. And I didn\u2019t like that before, and I just -- I -- I -- in the camps, you always had comas, people who were the same boat, and my whole story with Michael Swab is the same thing. I had a buddy, I had somebody who -- who felt like I did. And when I was in the army then as an officer, it\u2019s sometimes lonely, because you are maybe the only officer, and you are with the men, but they\u2019re not on an equal level with you, you still lonely. So I wung -- wasn\u2019t going to do that. I said, well, even my first sergeant was a man 20 years older than myself. When we were in private together, I ask him to call me by my first name, not say Lieutenant Willner, or sir -- he\u2019s 20 years older. So I made up for some of this loneliness by doing certain things, and the other thing that they didn\u2019t USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 117 talk about was having girlfriends. I got involved with other women. I was lonely. And I also, since I was -- since my liberation, I -- I wanted to get married, but I knew I didn\u2019t have an education, I didn\u2019t have a job, or -- in the re -- once I was in the army, I figured, well, a lieutenant doesn\u2019t make much money, but I'll wait til I'll be a captain or so. But I wanted to get married, and have children. And I -- there was part, getting married fast, not to be lonely any more. But I said to myself, I must find the right woman, because be very difficult to be married to a concentration camp survivor. You have your idiosyncrasies, maybe. But other people have too, who were -- who were not in camp, but there are certain things that we do have. I\u2019m aware -- I\u2019m aware of it. Some people don\u2019t know it, my f -- my best friend, Michael Swab, his whole life, whenever he was with me, or alone, walking the street, he look -- he look over his shoulder. He did this all the time, even after he got married, because he always thought some Gestapo or somebody was following him, that he was being -- so, that was a problem he had, not -- not a big problem, but so I observed him one time doing that. And some people had, like I said, idiosyncrasies. They also had -- think they are very bad. I must al -- also say that, since I was very close to Michael Swab, that he beat his second wife. And she told me one time, when she was -- when they were visiting here, and I -- I was really shook up, and so I decided -- I told my wife, and she said she knows, and thought that was terrible. When you got upset about something, instead of arguing with wife -- I argue with my wife, but then we clear it up before the end of the day, if it\u2019s not cleared up right away. But he beat his wife, so he was -- some of the real bad things from the camps, he took with him, and Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 118 he applied it to -- so I -- I couldn\u2019t -- this was terrible. I decided I will go with him under false pretense and talk to him about it, very seriously. Because we had no secrets for each other. And I took him to the Potomac River, near -- in a secluded area, nice day. I said, \u201cMichael, I got you up here because I want to talk to you. I don\u2019t want anybody around. And I want to tell -- to tell you -- you beat your wife.\u201d I had to be careful because he -- he would know that she told me or my wife, and that he\u2019|l beat up again. \u201cI -- I-I -- and this I-I cannot be quiet about. And you know, we\u2019ve always been very truthful to each other, and that is not a thing that I -- that you should do. There\u2019s no excuse for it. Absolutely none, you ca -- tell me anything you want, but I-I will not accept it. You don\u2019t beat your wife, you don\u2019t beat women, and I don\u2019t have to tell you why not, you don\u2019t do.\u201d He never said one word. He didn\u2019t say yes, no, or it\u2019s none of your business, which he wouldn\u2019t have said. And that was it. So anyway, my loneliness -- oh yeah, finding [indecipherable] wife. After I was 19, and out, every woman I went out with, or I was intimate with, I always considered, not marrying her, but what am I looking for besides sex\u2019? She had to have certain qualities that -- maybe more qualities because I went through the camps, but particularly because I went through the camps. Have [indecipherable] and I start making up a list. Get organized was always m-my way of doing things. And I wind up with good point and the bad points, what I want to see. And I gave each question a point, and when I came up with more good points than bad points, I- would she be a good wife? But it was just still a little game I was playing with myself, but I didn\u2019t ge -- consulted anybody else, but -- but needless to say, but I -- I -- I did get USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 119 involved with quite a few girls, and didn\u2019t make any difference what religion, or -- I did have one thing I do want to mention. I was a-always very fond of the French language, and everybody would have bet that Pll marry a French woman, so I could sp-speak French all the time. And I -- I thought so, too [indecipherable] my ol -- my oldest son just went to -- they had the 50 anniversary of the Normandy invasion in Europe. He and another officer went to France, and took some pictures there on the beaches there where we landed. And they still have some tank obstacles there. And I had to laugh, because he visited that, he took pictures, and I said, \u201cI was there, too.\u201d He said, \u201cI know where you were at that time.\u2019 He knows exactly where I was. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201canother time I was there, not during the invasion.\u201d When I was in the army, as a criminal investigator, I had a case, which took me to Karankan, France, which is right behind the beaches where we landed during the invasion. And my son [indecipherable] Karankan, but when I was there I met a French girl, and I stayed with her for a couple of days, and then I said, the same time I visit the beaches, and I have a picture with her standing next to the tank obstruction. They\u2019re not -- they\u2019re not bodies any more, but there are certain things that you can still see why -- what we encountered there. And -- and on the back it said the place, and the year, the -- and he said [indecipherable] the same place, but not like you probably. So, what I\u2019m trying to say is that I -- I was never alone by doing this, and I came -- I never came -- oh, I was engaged once, to a Jewish girl from Detroit, because I went to the chapel, to Jewish services here -- the military chapel, and I met this man, and he introduced me to his niece, who was visiting from Detroit.

My wife still talked to her, and din -- din -- she didn\u2019t throw it up. And -- so back to -- to a girl I got engaged to. She was okay, her family was okay in New Jersey, but then I was supposed to meet her parents -- excuse me- in -- in Detroit, and I went there, and I had just graduated from officer\u2019s school, I was very proud to have made it, and to have a career maybe, ahead of me, and to have succeeded, and all that stuff, okay. So -- also I -- I probably looked pretty good in uniform as an officer at the time. And so she was impressed, probably, but I found out Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 12] she was okay, but maybe too immature, just graduated from high school, and I was very mature. I could have handled it, but could she handle it, a difficult guy like me? No, but -- I wasn\u2019t difficult, but I -- I did have certain things I -- I -- the thing came a-abo-about in a way that I did not expect it to break off our engagement, but it was the right thing, I was lucky. When I visited her parents, they approved of me, and the father took me aside, say goodnight, and said to me, \u201cYou -- you are going to Korea I understand.\u201d I -- [ -- I expected to be ordered to Korea, I didn\u2019t know yet for sure. I said, \u201cYes.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat- what do you want to be, a defender of capitalism?\u201d And he talked to me in the way a Communist was talk -- would talk. And he was entitled to his opinion, but that was my country, I had went through hard times getting there, and I -- what he basically said that I shouldn\u2019t be an officer of an im-imperialist army. And I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to give up my career be that I\u2019ve practically fought for it,\u201d I went -- so I told him that I was not going to leave the army, and I could also called it I\u2019m a defender of a democracy. And I didn\u2019t argue with him, but just discuss it. But those were his words, actually, defender of capitalism. So I said to myself afterwards, I\u2019ve nothing against the girl, nothing against her parents as people, but this bother me. So knowing that I would be going to Korea, I said to myself, under normal circumstances, if I\u2019m married, and going to Korea, my wife, if I have no children, would either go back to her parents, or probably to my parent\u2019s house, and live with them til I come back from Korea, and then we have a house, or su -- apartment. So I said, well, I don\u2019t have parents. I don\u2019t have anybody. She will be with her parents while I\u2019m in Korea, and every day she\u2019ll hear from her father, \u201cWhat kind of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 122 life is this? Your husbands the other end of the world, you\u2019re here, and he\u2019s defending imperialism th -- over there in Korea.\u201d And before I know it, before I get back after a year, I have a divorce on my hands. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get married.\u201d This -- she -- she going to be under influence of her parents. She\u2019s young. If she had made up her own mind, be a different story. If she\u2019d [indecipherable] living with a girlfriend, but her intention was to stay on with her parents. And I think she\u2019ll be hearing this all the time. I\u2019m not going to start -- I want to get married once, and [indecipherable] and not get divorced. So she had to be the right woman, and I felt she wasn\u2019t the right one, so I broke it off. I felt very bad about it, and my aunt told me -- this woman who was against the marriage, \u201cWell Eddie, it\u2019s better to feel bad for a couple of months, than feeling bad the rest of your life.\u201d And I agreed with her. I went to Korea, but I had, shortly before Korea- well, this really doesn\u2019t matter, I met another woman, and I\u2019m mentioning this not just to mention I went out with women, but that I -- the specific circumstance. I -- when I went to Germany one time [indecipherable] the first time, as an enlisted man, I went to criminal investigation school, I mentioned that. And on the train I met a British girl, who was traveling with her mother from England to southern Germany. And I got to talk to her, and she said her mother was Jewish. So she was half Jewish, and that her father had divorced the mother under the nur -- Nuremberg laws. And -- but he wasn\u2019t a Nazi, but he took advantage of the Nuremberg laws. And he left Germany, too, he went to South America someplace, with the two boys. And he left the mother and the daughter in Germany, they got a -- they got to England. So when I met th-the mother, I was re- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 123 visiting friends, and I didn\u2019t know that her daughter who was traveling there, was married at that time. I didn\u2019t expect a woman, traveling with her mother, that she was married. She never told me about it, and she came to visit me at the school on weekends. That was near Munich, Germany. I got involved with her, and -- and when I went to Korea, she told me -- she asked me what I was going to do, I said, \u201cWell, I have four weeks of vacation. Since I\u2019m not engaged any more, I don\u2019t have any plans.\u201d She said -- and I still didn\u2019t know she was married at the time. She said, \u201cIf you would come visit me.\u201d I said yes. She, I think, took four weeks. We got [indecipherable] around the [indecipherable] and couple other places, and then she told me she was married, but that she\u2019s going to divorce her husband. And we had not talked about marriage, she and I, we just -- and to me it was another attraction. I -- I had -- not going to say that her on my list of prospective future wife, particularly just -- she was married, too. And I had no intention go out with a married woman, or -- because my time was valuable, and I figured a married woman, that\u2019s probably just for sex. But some ba -- maybe I'll marry her, maybe not. Not her -- not the British girl. So we were together four weeks, and I s -- said at the end of four weeks, \u201cDon\u2019t wait for me to come back from Korea, even if you get divorced, I\u2019m not going to marry you.\u201d Because it was her intention would get to know me better, and I thought -- I never thought one moment I would marry her. And there was nothing wrong with her, except whatever the problem was between her husband, she told me what it was. And so I knew from the beginning I was just spending -- having a good time, and she was having a good time. So, when we left on last day, we said good-bye for Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 124 good, and I was on my way to Korea -- after a couple of days, she asked me, in England, if you -- you can only get a divorce, which she still wanted to get, if you commit adultery- you admit to adultery. And when she talked about adultery, I said, \u201cWell, in my book, my dictionary, it said adultery is two wrong people doing a right thing.\u201d And -- and so I tried to keep -- keep a happy atmosphere, you know? To her it was just good-bye for good. Well, to me, too, but it was no -- no problem for me. She had still hopes that I would -- she was going to divorce her husband, maybe I\u2019 Il be interested. She -- so she went back to England, I went to Korea. All of a sudden -- well, she asked me if I would help her in -- in her divorce, because she can onl -- if she admits adultery in court, then she can divorce. But I figure I\u2019m single, I have no problem. I have no wife -- adultery, not that I say it\u2019s okay, but she committed adultery, but I didn\u2019t [indecipherable]. I said, \u201cSure, you can -- if that helps.\u201d And I was in Korea, I got a letter from the British court, from a judge, that she swore in court that she committed adultery with me, and they want to know whether it was true or not. And I found myself in a situation in Korea, I said -- I didn\u2019t think that far. An officer in the United States army, you\u2019re not supposed to commit adultery. An officer and a gentleman, they always put that gentleman in there. You know, a gentleman in my book is a man who di -- who\u2019ll defend a woman from any man but himself, that\u2019s a gentleman.

I said, I must answer this letter, but I will not admit to adultery, because the army [indecipherable] they were very strong on that at that time, not- not -- now it happens all the time, guys get with their fellow officers of lower ranking, and used to read in the papers, generals get kicked out, and so it was much more serious than now, now it\u2019s -- okay, so anyway -- but I cannot say I didn\u2019t, because she swore in court that she did.

So I stayed nine months in Japan, def -- s -- fixed up my papers saying that they agree that I should pick up some courses, that wasn\u2019t -- Japan wasn\u2019t the place [indecipherable] might be, and I should then go back, which I did. And I -- and I had nine wonderful months in Japan, in Tokyo. And I transferred back to United States, to Washington. I was assigned to -- as an assistant to the commandant of the command management school at Fort Belwah, which is right outside Washington. And I was living at Fort Meyer. Fort Meyer is -- was very nice. That was just for living purposes for me, and I commuted every day to Fort Belwah. One year after that, I was assigned to Heidelberg, Germany, to the headquarter of the U.S. Army, Europe, where I had been before as an enlisted man, a criminal investigator, and now I came back as an officer. And I knew the place, I liked the place. Heidelberg is a very romantic place, very beautiful. The Nekile river flows, there\u2019s an old castle there, and the Americans always picked a nice place to put up their headquarters. It was in a bombed out, very romantical. And there was a university there. It was a famous place, and also good to be stationed. So I was assigned there as chief of the analiss section for technical Intelligence. It was a staff officer\u2019s Jo -- assignment, and -- which was good for my record, and my boss was an Italian American, lieutenant colonel, whom I got along with very well, but actually, I found out when I -- shortly before going to Germany, that I was supposed to go to Berlin. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 128 And I got this letter from this colonel, and it said, \u201cDue to unso -- foreseen circumstances, you are coming to my headquarters in Heidelberg.\u201d And I didn\u2019t mind. Berlin would have been okay with me, too. And my old friend George Strauss was there already, and it would have been interesting in that we were -- would have been -- he -- he already was, George Strauss, a detachment commander, which means you are your own boss, you have so many men, and you direct the unit. It\u2019s very much in demand in the army to get ahead, to be the commander of a unit, which I was going to be, but when I went to Heidelberg, I was a staff officer, not a commander of a unit. But that was okay, too. I got into a position where I had a little bit of supervision. My boss had supervision over my friend George Strauss. But my boss, Colonel Skolie, was retiring pretty soon from the army, and he didn\u2019t care any more about what\u2019s going on, he didn\u2019t want to be bothered, un there was something bad going on, and he always told me, \u201cWillner, you take care of it.\u201d And I would call j -- my friend George Strauss in Berlin, and say, the colonel said to do this or do that. He never did, he left 1t up to me to s -- act in his name. And it was a good arrangement, and I liked it, and George Strauss didn\u2019t know that -- I told him afterwards, I said, \u201cThe colonel never said any such thing, I was making these up.\u201d And he was m -- ma -- it was okay with him. And so, after I got assigned to Heidelberg, to Colonel Skolie, he had a habit of going every morning for coffee to the officer\u2019s club at 10 o\u2019clock, and he asked me to come along with him. And we sat down, had our cup of coffee [indecipherable] was little bit of exercise, since always sitting behind a desk, and then -- so Colonel Skolie, the first two weeks, he was watching me USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 129 like a hawk while drinking coffee. And I looked around the young women, and he said [indecipherable] to me, \u201cWell, you probably noticed that I watch you.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I did.\u201d \u201cWell, there\u2019s a reason for it. The guy you are replacing, we had to get rid of him, he was kicked out of the army. He turned out to be a homosexual officer, and he got caught in something. That\u2019s why you were changed from Berlin, to -- to replace him here in my headquarters. And I\u2019m very much pleased that you are interested in girls.\u201d So he -- he was afraid he gets another guy who was a homosexual. It was not very common, but it- it did happen. So Colonel Skolie had -- once before in his career had another homosexual. He was afraid himself that someone might think he might be ac/dc, that the army is going to check him. But he wasn\u2019t, he was a Catholic, with a Protestant wife, and he had a good marriage, but except for religion. He insisted on going to Catholic church, and she insisted going with the children -- well, he was a very nice guy. So here I was in Heidelberg, and he was happy that I was not a homosexual, you know, I was very much interested in girls, and I started dating like mad. I met my wife after three months there. In those three months, before I met my wife, I had gone out with three different girls, and had a good time, and one of them was a -- woman was in the PX -- I don\u2019t know you know what the PX 1s, sales girl. And when I got married she was a saleslady who advised my wife what -- what she\u2019ll buy. Well, she knows I\u2019m going to get married, but - and she was just a girl, German girl that just want to get married to an American. And wat -- when I met my wife was in the headquarters in the office, a very interesting, I\u2019m not going to tell the whole story, but I knew immediately, and I -- like I said I was in USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 130 meantime going from 19 to 31 years, 12 years a long time, and I had -- in the meantime, I had a couple of girls I might have considered, including my fianc\u00e9e.

And a lot of girls were dating American soldiers, and I looked, and she didn\u2019t date, or talk to any American soldiers. She wasn\u2019t one of those that just want to get married to an American, and to have a boyfriend. And so I said hello to her a couple of times, and she didn\u2019t seem to be interested very much. And I was, in meeting her, because she wasn\u2019t dating anybody, I know that -- well, she could have dated a German outside that I didn\u2019t know about, but you -- and so when she was working -- only when she wasn\u2019t studying, but she didn\u2019t have any money to continue her study in Heidelberg.

So to meet her -- she didn\u2019t seem to be much interested meeting me. I figure I\u2019Il meet her. I ask her one time -- oh yeah, the first thing that happened, I -- there was a trial in Heidelberg over the SS -- who -- who was born in Heidelberg, they caught him after the war, he was a -- not -- not high-ranking, a simple guy, who had -- who was accused of having killed three people. They didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t say Jews or not Jews, but he was an SS, but they weren\u2019t sure they could prove it, and the only one and the -- that they caught in Heidelberg, who was a native of Heidelberg. But when I read the story in the paper, I read that what he did before he became an SS. He was street sweeper in Heidelberg, a guy, very simple, no education -- very little educa -- and a guy with probably inferiority complex, who all of a sudden became an SS, with a nice uniform, looked sharp, but was dumb, not educated. And was somebody all of a sudden, and then beat up Jews, or whatever. He was a member of the elite in Germany. And I looked at it and said, \u201cThey ought to cor --,\u201d I said to myself, \u201cthey ought to catch the big guys, not a small guy like him.\u201d Some of the mass murderers, and n-not [indecipherable] people. And I decided I wanted to see a trial. I didn\u2019t know the guy, he was not in the camp I was in, and -- but I was just curious how the German courts were doing with a guy like that. So I told my boss I wanted to go that day -- I want a day off, I want to go to court, I need you okay that. And I went out the door. My wife started going out the door, too from a different [indecipherable]. I said, \u201cWhere are you going, Miss Suberchess?\u201d And she has a Latin name [indecipherable] in Germany during the Middle Ages, only the doctors, teachers, and the pe-people who could read and write, they spoke USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 132 Latin, not German, educated people. And her family was a gen -- m-mainly a family of teachers. So I said, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d She said she\u2019s going to court. \u201cOh,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to court, too.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat -- what kind of a crime did you commit?\u201d I was trying to make a joke.[indecipherable] \u201cI didn\u2019t commit a crime, but I\u2019m just watch a trial.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m watching a trial, too. What kind of a trial, are you a witness, then?\u201d No, she didn\u2019t want to tell me right away. And it came out she\u2019s going the same place I was. And I couldn\u2019t think of a reason why a German girl would be interested in SS, unless she was a relative, or something. So I ask her, \u201c\u201cWhy are you interested in SS?\u201d And she gave me the -- a reason, the same reason that I was interested in it. See how justice is done in Germany today. So that got me interested in her, more than just for other reasons, and a young woman is interested in -- in Nazis, and [indecipherable]. And I said, \u201cOkay, you want a ride?\u201d She was going by bicycle, I had my car, and is that okay? She accepted a ride, and the -- excuse me [indecipherable]. So we got to the court, I parked my car, I -- like I said, I was in uniform, and came out with her, and there\u2019s a -- a guard or some guy up there by the doors on the courtroom, and the courtroom is filled already with people, complete -- the guy said, \u201cCan\u2019t go in, it\u2019s full.\u201d Well, I figured I am an officer in the United States army, they lost the war, I\u2019m going to go in, no matter what. And I -- and I spoke German. So I said to the guard, \u201cWho gave you your order that you can\u2019t let an American army officer in?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cthey didn\u2019t tell me an American army officer, they said nobody goes in.\u201d \u201cWell, I -- | am sorry, but you will make a place for me. I'll -- , and there was my future wife, left out. I couldn\u2019t speak for her, that -- give her a seat, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 133 but I, as an army officer had -- was considered maybe -- they -- they -- they figured we had -- we won the war, and we wer -- demanded certain things, but I wasn\u2019t normally doing that, but I was insisting here, in this case. Make a long story short, my wife didn\u2019t go into the court, and this guy told a German civilian to leave, that he had to make some space for some important people. But only me, and I sat up there, and I listened to an unimpressive to -- trial. The guy -- I almost felt sorry for the guy -- the former -- he was a beat up old -- well, not old man, but he was, at that time I\u2019m going to see him an old man, because I was only 30 and something, and he was 45 or something. Well, they couldn\u2019t prove actually, any murder, but he admitted having been SS, having been in certain place, and had beaten up people, and to -- but not -- they couldn\u2019t prove that he murdered people. So he got a couple of months in jail. That was standard throughout Germany [indecipherable]. But I -- 1t bothered me. I said, \u201cHere is a guy who probably had an inferiority complex. In the concentration camp he could beat up professors and doctors, and people who were more intelligent, and more educated than he was, because he had no education. And he got caught. But the big biggies, they were free. And I sa -- I thought that the guys who were over him should be sitting in -- in the docket there then. Well, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m s -- I felt sorry for him, but I -- I -- I have -- didn\u2019t think that was -- he shouldn\u2019t be sitting there, that somebody else should be.

            "answer": "But 1-it\u2019s a long story, with a rabbi involved, and a general involved, and a -- the Germans, because of Communism, and because of Nazism too. And also, not myself, I -- I wanted to make sure one thing, I\u2019m not marrying to a big Nazi family, in respect to my parents, not that she would have had any guilt in this, her father, if he would have been a Nazi, but that would be a very odd thing. But I did have a secretary, or a -- he was actually called in the army, a clerk, for -- he was a soldier, who could type up my classified stuff. He was a Jewish guy, by the name of Ross Engle. He was -- had a master\u2019s degree in political science, he was drafted. Didn\u2019t have any desire to become an officer. He would have made a good officer, but -- little guy like me, and he was going out with a German girl that I also knew, and I just talked to [indecipherable] in the finance office, like a cashier, or something like that, military finance office. And his case is interesting, 1t was just the opposite from mine. He met this very nice, young girl, very lovely, and it turns out that she came from big Nazi family. So big that it was a famous USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 135 name in Germany. He was her -- the brother of her mother, of the Rice Youth Leader, with all the German Jews went into uniform, the Nazi party member. And -- like the boy scouts, but they wore little knives, and all that. I would have been one, I would have been Jewish, but -- the Hitler Youth. That\u2019s what it -- what -- Hitler Youth Leader. He was the Hitler Youth Leader of Germany. There were two during Hitler\u2019s reign, and he was one of them. So the mother was the sister of this guy. Well, that was during the war, and I figure well, after the war -- he figured the -- that the war is finished, that they don\u2019t keep their mouth shut, because they were Nazis, and anti-Semites, probably. Well, you didn\u2019t have to be a Nazi to be an anti-Semite, necessarily. You could have been Nazi, and have known some Jews that you liked, and still be a big Nazi, and -- and still like Jews secretly, or something. But in his case it turned out, the poor guy, he was very smart -- like I said, he had a master\u2019s degree in political science. He was only a company clerk, he was doing good work, and he -- he met this girl, and so it turned out her family\u2019s Nazi, and when he talked to me about this, he told me then that his father is a rabbi, and his grandfather was a rabbi, and here he was in -- marrying into a Nazi family. H-He was in love with the girl. Well, I said, \u201cWell, I consider myself lucky, I also -- y- you know about my going out with Miss Dambotsios, and I found out from my wife only recently that he tried to date her too, one time, but she didn\u2019t want to go out with him. And so, he came to my wedding, and he took all the pictures. I have pictures of -- very nice guy."

                " So I was very much impressed with her ideas about Nazism, and how much she knew about Jews. Not from her parents, but after the war, because they didn\u2019t have any Jews where she lived, in the countryside there. All she did, she thinks one girl that she befriended was Jewish, probably, but she wasn\u2019t sure, when she was a kid. And so [indecipherable] I did get married to this girl, and he got permission right away, in the -- in the army, you had to get permission, because -- not just for security, but they didn\u2019t want any bad elements to come into United States, girls who were prostitutes, or -- excuse me, or had other things, Communists, or something. And so they tried to get the -- the army required two things . In one, a form, a letter from your commanding officer, your boss, that he certif -- that he okays that so and so gets married to -- and there\u2019s -- he had to do some checking with the police, and then finally approve it. In a case of an officer, in my case, I had to meet Colonel Skolie, my immediate superior, but it was only a performer thing. I had the paper typed out, and I just said, \u201cWould you please sign my permission to get married?\u201d Because I was an officer, I had more of a privilege, let\u2019s say. And they -- they -- they assumed that an officer, which wasn\u2019t always true, had the common sense not to marry a prostitute, or -- but they did. Some of the best looking girls were prostitutes there. And they were [indecipherable] glad to get rid of them, send them to United States. And there were guys who knew their wives were prostitute, and -- and still want to marry them. But anyway, when I came with my paper to my colonel, he of course signed it right away, and he had known me for awhile already, so we had no problem. But then my -- the second thing that we had to get was permission from the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 137 chaplain -- not permission, to have the chaplain signature on there. If you\u2019re Jewish, you go to the Jewish chaplain. That\u2019s the -- in the army they have chaplains who are catering - catering wha -- providing the military with moral support, or religious support, who on Sundays have a mass, if they\u2019re Catholic, or they\u2019re Protestant, and on Friday night have a Jewish service in that army chapel, which is -- in the army serves all faith. So when the Jews have their service, they cover up the cross, usually, and the rabbi comes and talks from the chapel. In that time the Jewish community in Heidelberg was about 200 people. So we had a Jewish chaplain, in this case, Orthodox. So there is -- you never know what the chaplain, if he\u2019s Jewish, whether Orthodox, Reformed, or Conservative. The army took them in, and there were usually many Orthodox rabbis who didn\u2019t have a job because every o-orth -- there a lot of ri -- guys -- rabbis, who don\u2019t have a congregation here in the United States. And the army needed rabbis, and they went to [indecipherable] called the chaplain\u2019s board, or the chaplain -- they advised the army on who might make a good military chaplain. And they only re-recommended Orthodox people, which was wrong, because the majority of Jews are not Orthodox in the United States of -- United States Army. In Israel it\u2019s a different -- even there they\u2019re not -- they\u2019re not the majority. But the Orthodox chaplains are required not to s-say the prayers all in Hebrew, but to talk mainly English, and have the He-Hebrew. Whereas the -- the Reform rabbis have everything English, and I preferred that because w -- if I wanted to say a prayer or anything, I like to understand what I\u2019m -- I could read Hebrew, but I didn\u2019t understand. I studied for Bar Mitzvah, and never was. Two weeks before my Bar Mitzvah, the war Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 138 started, in 1940, and I was not Bar Mitzvahed, so -- but I knew how to read Hebrew, and I knew the prayers, but I didn\u2019t understand it. I was never much interested in it, but -- but when I did go to chapel, I wanted to make sure if I did say something, I want to understand it. So, with the Orthodox, we had no common ground, they -- they didn\u2019t do what the army [indecipherable] told them to, to say it in English, but they -- they rattled, and they shugon, and they went through the motions like the Orthodox do, and I didn\u2019t do this at ho -- in my hometown in Germany, and I didn\u2019t do this here, but [indecipherable] just went along, everybody chanted certain songs. So, the one we had in Hamburg that time was Orthodox, and I knew was going to face, going with my paper to have him sign it, he probably would say how about your wife converting before I sign the paper. And exactly what happened. But, before I went to the Jewish chaplain, I went to the cath -- no, to the Protestant chaplain. There were three chaplains there, Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish. And the Protestant chaplain was the head chaplain, he had the highest rank. He was a colonel, and the Jewish chaplain was a major. And like I said, I was a lieutenant, so I was even lower. They all had ranks. I went to the chief chaplain, becau -- you see, it just said chaplain\u2019s signature, but what they meant was of your faith. There wasn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t have to do this, but I figure I\u2019m going to get around this Orthodox chaplain, who 1s go -- not going to sign my paper, because he wants my wife to d -- to convert. And I went to the Protestant chaplain, and he said, \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cyes, I could sign your paper, but I have to respect the Jewish chaplain, he is [indecipherable] your faith here, and I would feel better if you get his signature.\u201d And I said to the chaplain, \u201cI tell you the truth, I Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 139 didn\u2019t go to the Jewish chaplain because the Orthodox. That\u2019s okay with me, but I am afraid he is going to ask me for my wife to convert before he sign the paper. And I\u2019m not willing to let that happen, because although my wife probably would convert to marry me, but to me it doesn\u2019t mean a thing, and I don\u2019t approve of the Orthodox, I don\u2019t go around -- if we had a Reform rabbi, I would consider it, but we don\u2019t happen to have one.\u201d And he said, \u201cTry it anyway.\u201d Okay, I went to see the Jewish chaplain. I knew him already. And he was a guy who was not -- not very nice. He was very Yiddish, if you say, and from he -- like he ca -- he came out of the ghetto, and he was telling me what to do, and that my wife or I should do this or that. And I said, \u201cI am not Orthodox, rabbi, please. I respect your views, I want you respect mine, too. And I, if I consider myself anything, I am Jewish, and I\u2019m not religious. And, as a matter of fact, I have questions not about Judaism, but religion in general, and my faith, because of the concen,\u201d -- he knew I was in concentration camp. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure about God, but in the respect m-my parents would have been alive, and they would have wanted me to marry in the chapel, Jewish. And they probably would have approved of a non-Jewish wife, but I -- I -- I would get married in this chapel, but not Orthodox.\u201d And I knew that the chapels in the army, even if they were Orthodox, if he did approve of a marriage, or a wedding [indecipherable] to perform a wedding, he could perform this in a way that was not approved by the army, was not completely Orthodox, but -- End of Tape Six, Side A Beginning Tape Six, Side B USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 140 ",
                " \u201cHow about converting your wife before I sign this paper?\u201d I said, \u201cI may -- no thank you, we\u2019ve have talked about extensively. I just want your signature, so I can go ahead and get married.\u201d He hesitated, he said he wanted to talk about conversion to my wife, and -- who was not with me. And I said, \u201cNo, ki -- rabbi, this is between me and my wife, not between you and my wife. And we talked about it plenty, and me -- don\u2019t think -- I think my wife is a good -- will be a good wife, and had a good background, and I couldn\u2019t require more than that. So please sign my paper.\u201d And he said he wants to talk to her, he wants a conversion. I said, \u201cNo, I told you, we\u2019re not -- she\u2019s not going to convert. Not because she doesn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t want to.\u201d And he was really upset because a Jew was doing this. But that\u2019s mine life, not his life, or anybody else\u2019s. So I said, \u201cOkay, you\u2019re not going to sign? I\u2019m going back and I\u2019Il see what we can do about this.\u201d He said, \u201cYou- | won\u2019t sign til I talk some more to you.\u201d He didn\u2019t sign, he didn\u2019t say til she converts, be -- he could not do that. And I said, \u201cBefore I leave your office, rabbi, I\u2019m going to tell you, you are a bad rabbi. You are a bad military officer. Here I was, a lower ranking guy, and I\u2019m telling you something that somebody should have heard a long time to you. Not because you don\u2019t want to -- me to -- you know, give paper to marry, or my wife to convert, because in general, you run lousy services here in this chapel, and this 1s not just me who\u2019s saying this. You are an Orthodox rabbi, and I\u2019m not Orthodox, that\u2019s not why I\u2019m against you. Because the army requires you, as an Orthodox rabbi, to conduct most of your service in English, and that\u2019s why you lost the congregation here, and there are about 200 Jews here, and you walk in here on a Friday night, you get a dozen people USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 14] here, you don\u2019t get anybody. And we had rabbis who were Orthodox, who had a lot more attraction to get Jews in here. Apparently you don\u2019t care. Y-You care about certain things about Judaism.\u201d And I -- finally, I shouted at him, and that was it, I walked out. And I was told I can get permission to get married without getting his signature on there. Okay. Two, three weeks later, I heard about a plane going to Israel for American military officers who were chaplains, or rabbis, for the clergy, military clergy. And it was a private trip, a German airplane, passenger plane, but somebody in the headquarters was arranging this, to visit the holy land, which is for Jews, Catholics, it\u2019s for everybody, Christian and Jew. So it was a very cheap price, 200 dollars, I believe, for two weeks in Israel, including the trip. This was in 1956 -- \u201957. And I heard there were two seats empty on there, they couldn\u2019t fill two seats. But like I said, all the people going were -- were clergymen, and I found out that my rabbi wasn\u2019t going, which was fine with me, but two seats were free, but you had to pay for it, just like the rabbis did. For the rabbis it was not paid for by the army, but it\u2019s just some time off they got that -- seeing the holy land. I had an uncle in Israel, who I\u2019m -- talked about before on the tape, who went to Israel, became prisoner of war, fought for the briti -- with the British, and -- my mother\u2019s brother, and who broke the saber for the police, that\u2019s the story I have here on the tape. And I wanted to see him, and he was getting to be an old man, he -- he was a widow in the meantime, no children, and he was my favorite uncle, actually. And he also had done something in the war, fought against the Germans in the first World War, he was in [indecipherable]. Okay, so I went and I said, \u201cIf these seats not -- can I pay for one of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 142 these seats and go to Israel?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d I put my name on the list, off I went to Israel. Who sits next to me? The only -- the only Reformed rabbi military we had in Germany. I had heard of him, but he was far away from where I was at. He is my -- he sits next to me, and we look at each other, and he didn\u2019t know who was I, I didn\u2019t know who he was. And I mention my name, and he said, \u201cWillner, Willner. I got it. You are the one that gave hell to the Orthodox rabbi in the headquarters in Heidelberg where there\u2019s chaplain.\u201d I said, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d You know, to -- word had gotten around in the meantime, there was this young officer who we called this chaplain of the doorma, and what happened, there was a -- a retreat for Jewish chaplains, military chaplain, and Jewish military chaplain assistants. Every chaplain had an assistant, a Jewish guy in the case of a Jewish chaplain. In the case of the Catholic chaplain, he was Catholic soldier. And they were the clerks, the secretaries, in fact. So our rabbi had the secretary, a Jewish guy, a -- a sergeant or something, who was also main career in the army, and when I had the argument with the chaplain, door was open to the next office, and there was the Jewish chaplain assistant sitting outside. And he had gone on this retreat, and he had told the other ch-chaplain assistants that, you know, \u201cSome young lieutenant in Heidelberg, he really came in one day, and he gave my boss, who\u2019s a major, gave him hell, told him off in no uncertain terms, what a bad rabbi he was. I -- I -- I never heard anything like it.\u201d And so, he had all the other chaplain assistant. Then the assistant of the chaplain I was sitting next to on the airplane, he had heard it from the assistant from the Orthodox chaplain, the story. He said, \u201cYou are the guy I -- Willner, who wanted to get -- want to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 143 get married, and,\u201d -- I say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s the whole thing. I don\u2019t care about Orthodox, and- but I just want to have him sign my paper, and if he didn\u2019t want to sign it, and didn\u2019t,\u201d - also said I -- I couldn\u2019t use the chapel, but maybe get some other rabbi to come. There weren\u2019t many rabbis in Germany, but -- to perform the ceremony. And I said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t get married -- I got married at city hall. I\u2019d -- it\u2019s not required that I get married under Jewish law, or [indecipherable] law in the chapel, I just don\u2019t get married in the chapel.\u201d And so the Reform rabbi said, \u201cYou have a little problem there. I -- I don\u2019t really see it as a problem. I don\u2019t know your future wife. I think differently about these things, and I\u2019m willing to marry you. Beca I -- if you want -- you want to get married in the first place in the chapel, why should you be kept out of the chapel because the rabbi doesn\u2019t agree? That\u2019s not his private property, the chapel,\u201d he said. \u201cHe should marry anybody wants to get married.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, he -- he\u2019Il marry anybody wants to convert. Maybe some guy matries a prostitute off the street, as long as she c-converts to Judaism, he\u2019 II -- he\u2019ll marry her, probably,\u201d you know. And so this guy -- by this time we were finished with the trip. In Israel we separate, I\u2019m going to see my uncle, they went sightseeing. In two weeks we met again to depart Israel, and on the way back, I sat next to him again, and he said, \u201cYou [indecipherable] Israel, and -- and by the way, do you still want to get married in the chapel?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d I said, \u201cyes. Because my parents would like to see me get marr -- and it\u2019s a nicer thing than just signing a paper in city hall, and I'll go for a Jewish ceremony, but nothing -- even Orthodox, you know, but -- but not somebody who require my wife to be a -- become a,\u201d -- he, \u201cOkay, I don\u2019t require your wife to convert, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 144 but after I meet her, I make up my own opinion I want to marry you.\u201d He wanted to see what kind of woman she was, and -- so -- \u201cBut you have to come to my place, get married in my chapel, I cannot do it in that chapel in [indecipherable].\u201d I said okay. \u201cBut first you introduce me to your wife.\u201d So we went, and he secluded himself for about two hours in his office while I was waiting outside. And I said, \u201cWhat are you guys doing in there? You -- you converting my wife now, when she comes out you say she is a Jew.\u201d And he -- he was asking her questions, and telling her. And he says, \u201cYour wife, 1t seems to me she probably knows as much about Jude as you do, if not more.\u201d I say, [indecipherable]. \u201cWell, I gave her a couple of books to learn some more about Judaism, see, because I want to -- if I marry her in a Jewish ceremony, I want her to know about Judaism, but no conversion.\u201d [indecipherable]. And as far as the actual date is concerned, we can make that later. I went back to Heidelberg -- and his place was a couple hours away from Heidelberg, and I -- he -- yeah, a-at that time, talking about luck, not his luck, the Orthodox chaplain was ordered back to United States before my wedding day came up, and I was to go to the other chaplain -- because he had a child that was -- mentally had a problem, and for personal reasons he was transferred back to United States, to another job in the army. And we had no chaplain in Heidelberg, and so the chaplain called me up, the -- he informed that, \u201cOh, you are lucky. You don\u2019t even have to come my chapel down here, I\u2019Il come to your chapel. You -- Pll perform the marriage in front of the Jews that you know, that live in Heidelberg, and so as we planned to do here, but you do in your chapel. I could not have done this if your chaplain was still there, that\u2019s USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 145 like hitting him in the face, you know, that\u2019s some -- making him look bad. But he\u2019s not there, and so we\u2019re not doing -- he\u2019s not coming back either, not [indecipherable] gone for sure.\u201d [indecipherable] fine. So he said, \u201cWell, you know, we\u2019re not going to have a big thing.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want a big thing. Just a few friends from the office,\u201d or -- non- Jews, Jews, my boss is going come to the wedding, and we go to city hall, say -- in Germany you have a very f -- not fancy, but a more former wedding -- even in the city hall when you get your papers -- not talking about the party, or dinner, or something. But so he came to Heidelberg, and we went to the chapel. I took my boss along, my bosses boss, high ranking officer. Rosinger, the guy who was going to take the picture, and my -- and the only Jewish guy in my -- no, Rosinger was one in the military Jewish guy, and I had one civilian [indecipherable] for me, who was a GS 12, who was an expert on Intelligence some field, who was born as a German Jew in Berlin, whose father had been arrested in the Crystal night, going to Dachau, and the mother was Christian. The mother thought the father\u2019s not going to come back from Dachau, she committed suicide in Berlin. And -- and the father came back from Dachau, and his wife was dead. But that\u2019s just -- this happened. So Jerry Coats, who was also Jewish, then came along. He married a girl also from a Nazi family, a judge, a Nazi judge who didn\u2019t want any part of him, but he was the other Jewish guy. So we had Jerry, and Rosinger, and my boss, and the boss\u2019 boss, and that was it. "

            "answer": "After I got married, everything was finished -- finished ralb. I didn\u2019t know this, but they had considered me, before I got married, to be assigned as a liaison officer to the German CIA, as a army liaison officer, US Army, because I spoke German fluently, and they require that. In the meantime I got married, and they said -- the Germans said, \u201cIf he\u2019s married, the officer, his wife must be an American, but to also speak German fluently.\u201d Well, I -- I just happened to fit the bill, and the -- in the first one I was not USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 148 married, and then I was married, too. So when I then got called in and was told I get the job, and my wife was cleared, and our general G2, he\u2019s the chief Intelligence officer of the command for Europe, he called me in and said, \u201cWell now, you are on the way to occupy a very important job. We picked you because we feel you fit the bill, but I know your background, concentration camps. You do not go there to find out who the Nazis are. You find -- you go there because you have a job to do for the United States. I can understand if you have any feelings, you find Nazis in there. We know that, but your job is not to uncover them, your job is to see that we get all the report that we\u2019re supposed to get, that the people that we interview, and so on, that they\u2019re not -- they don\u2019t keep the information from us.\u201d Former Nazis, or whatever. \u201cBut not for -- because of what happened to you, that you are getting revenge.\u201d I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about it. I know what job I have to do. But, I will not associate socially with the guys I know who previously had been big Nazis to all of a sudden cater to us, and,\u201d -- \u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d he said, \u201cbut like I said, you\u2019re not going there to stir up trouble in the German agency.\u201d They all had ph-phony names, and there were war criminals who were hired after the war, but soon gotten rid of later, but they came in there. So I went to the agency, and everything wound up very well, til one day -- they had three liaison officers like myself, British, French, and ger -- and -- and American, with the German agency, and everything went on fine, and -- til one day the French liaison officer asked for a meeting with me outside the agency where we were working, to have lunch someplace in the countryside. And he wants to talk to me about something very seriously, that he felt that I understand USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 149 more than anybody else, about Nazis and the German CIA, specifically one man, who was an SS officer, and Gestapo member, and you know, had committed a war crime in Czechoslovakia, who was working with us, but who is working really against us, because he is one who will not give us all the reports, who looks down on us, who probably still a Nazi, and who -- who really doesn\u2019t cooperate with us. \u201cIf he had cooperated, I probably wouldn\u2019t have said a thing,\u201d he said, \u201cbut here\u2019s his file,\u201d and he gave me a file about two inches thick, in a briefcase, and he say, \u201cTake it back with you, look it over yourself, and we, the French government, want this guy out of this job. And since he\u2019s in the American occupation zone,\u201d wh-where we were located, \u201cI feel I should go to the American liaison officer, and have him take care of it.\u201d And I just -- with a smile he said, \u201cI know, because of your background, you\u2019ll do something about it.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, frankly, you\u2019re right, but my general told me that I\u2019m not here to find out who the Nazis are, who the war criminals are. You know what my job is, same as yours. But I know we,\u201d -- somebody like this, who was sentenced to death twice, in absentia, in Czechoslovakia. After the war, they couldn\u2019t find him. They knew him as a worker -- they knew he was alive somewhere, because he had submerged in a German agency under a different name. So the French officer, \u201cHere\u2019s the file, Eddie, take it home with you. If your general decides to do nothing about it, we will do something about it. But Pll leave it to your judgment.\u201d So he said -- I said, \u201cWhat will you do if my people say no, they don\u2019t want any part of that? Like I said, the general told me, I\u2019m not there to find out the SS or the Gestapo man.\u201d He said, \u201cVery simple,\u201d he said, \u201cand please convey this to your general. We will USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 150 give it to the local newspapers, we will make public that in a new -- in the west German government, in the newly created Central Intelligence Agency of West Germany, you have a guy who was condemned to death by the Czechs, and you employ him. Not very good for the German -- the new west German government.\u201d I said, \u201cGood.\u201d I said, \u201cIll take care of it. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have to go newspapers, but I don\u2019t know, but I cannot promise.\u201d I took it to Heidelberg. Right away I ask for -- I get into the general\u2019s office, sometimes very difficult. I said, \u201cI have something of utmost importance.\u201d Okay, I was let in. I said, \u201cGeneral, I remember what you told me, my job is not to find out who the Nazis are, but I found something worse, I found a war criminal in our midst, who is also probably against us, Americans, and I did not go after him. Here\u2019s what happened, the French asked me to speak to them, and gave me a file for you to look over, and make a decision. We hoping to get him out.\u201d And that actually took place. He said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He had no problem with that, that I was just passing it on. I said, \u201cFrankly, I -- I -- I read the whole file, and the man, on a high level, he was retired early -- they said retired, but I think he was transferred to another place, under another name.\u201d But that\u2019s all I could do, but I did something where I could do. The director general of the agency where I was, one time told a young officer, a naval officer West Germany [indecipherable] was working temporarily. He didn\u2019t know I was in a concentration camp when I got to his agency, but one day I was -- 1t was very hot in the office, I took my jacket off, I had a short sleeve shirt on, and somebody saw the number on my arm. Apparently he knew right away what that was, and the word got around to the director that -- that the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 151 American liaison officer probably was in concentration camp. And he never talked to me about it, the boss there, but the naval officer, a young guy, who was not [indecipherable] young guy, after the war, he became a naval officer, the guy was about 30 years old, married. He in -- I invited him -- he invited me to his home first for dinner one time with my wife, and I invite him to my house. And we didn\u2019t talk about business, because I figured that was improper, that they probably think I\u2019m going to li -- hear him out, see what he knows about them, and digging up things that they didn\u2019t want us to know. And after the social visit, the two social visits, he came to my office. He said he\u2019d been told by the director not to soci -- socially associate with me. They were afraid I was going to find out there were a lot -- a lot of the guys in there who -- so that\u2019s the story about that I was"

And they\u2019re very submissive, the Japanese, when they don\u2019t win. And they become prisoners, and -- so I -- I didn\u2019t have any problem with that, or -- I don\u2019t know if anybody else had, after MacArthur, who most people feel had the right type of occupation in Japan, for Japan. In Germany it wouldn\u2019t have worked that way, had a different type of occupation. But in Japan, the Japanese became very pro-American right away, because the policies MacArthur -- and the democracy, which introduced into ja -- Japan right away, and they fell right in line. And they changed over very quickly, whereas in Germany, I feel, they didn\u2019t change over so quickly, if they change over at all. Compared to the Nazis, I think there is no comparison, except the Japanese themself, compare themself during the war to the Germans. They called themself Germans of the Far East. But they didn\u2019t do all the things the Germans did. So -- and after the war, they also felt that had something in common with the Germans. They lost the war, both of them. So the big thing that I can state, the difference, when my wife and I took a taxi in Tokyo, and we spoke in English, there was a distance between the taxi driver and us. This was in 1950 -- after Korean war, in 1958 - \u201959 - \u201960. And they were still repairing all things from the bombardment. And the Japanese tax1 drivers, for instance, if we talk German in the back of the cab, he will listen, he will say USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 159 after awhile, \u201cWhat nationality are you?\u201d And I had this thing, I was an amer -- an American, of course, but they respected the Germans, even though they both -- because like I said, they felt they had something in common, they also lost the war together.

And my wife was not willing -- she was not willing to become a school teacher, and be taught where to taught, and what to teach. She also wanted to become a teacher.

And this was a huge mess hall cona -- called a consolidated mess hall at Camp Killmer, New Jersey. And it fed about 2,000 men, so it\u2019s a real big operation.

I arranged one time here in Washington, at the officer\u2019s club at Fort Meyer, to send some food that was leftover to the old people\u2019s home. You don\u2019t say old people\u2019s home any more, but senior citizens, or whatever. So we can all just do something about it. In the army it was just well, when I asked for some leftover for my dogs, they packed up a whole roast for my USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 175 dog. Well, I -- I said, that whole roast could be -- there are no meals at night, people who work night shift, they don\u2019t get fed, the mess hall is closed, only in the day is open. You can cut up some sandwiches for them, and help themselves. And you have some leftovers spoil, then you can throw it away. But they had refrigerators, and just everything was there. But anyway, it bothered me because I saw so many people hungry in the war, and I was hungry. And the final outcome was that after trying everything else, I stood at the end of the line when they cleaning their plates. They just shove their leftovers into a big vat, and then put into a machine, and machine cleans their tray. I made guys go back who had too much food on their plate, I made them go back to the table and eat. And somebody said to the officer on duty that they had in Camp Killmer, New Jersey, and he came over, and he took me aside, and he said, \u201cLieutenant Willner, I understand why you are doing this, but you cannot do it here. This is -- this -- this one of the freedoms we have, they can take it or leave it, like many other things. And besides, we have so much food, we\u2019re not hungry. I know there are hungry people in the world, n -- but not right here at Camp Killmer. And we -- if they want to waste it, that\u2019s up to them.\u201d"

            "answer": "Well, first of all I really should talk about my wife, who came before the children. The- not the extraordinary children, but the extraordinary wife, which I feel she is, and our oldest son -- first of all, we have six boys and -- no, I\u2019m -- six children, three boys and three girls, and they range from 30 to 40. So we had all of them within 10 years. And they all accomplished already something in their life. They all went to college. Some of them have two degrees, some of them have Master\u2019s, and one of them has -- the one in the army, the oldest one, has a Master\u2019s, and a Ph.D., and is now teaching at West Point. Now, Albert, that\u2019s Albert Willner, th -- 1s 40, but I really don\u2019t know where to start with his extraordinary accomplishments, and unusual interests, as the oldest of our children, like I said, three boys and three girls. But before I start bragging about him, I should start at the source of all these, my wonderful wife, Johanna, a German born Protestant, without converting to Judaism, has been the most supportive in raising our children in the Jewish faith. All of our children have had 10 years of Jewish education. As for myself, any [indecipherable] believe in God, no matter what religion, is fine. The most important thing is what\u2019s in your heart. Because of my past, and in memory of my parents, 28 members of my family, and so many who had to die just because they were Jews, I would always remain a Jew. In summary, after my life -- after the concentration camps, the best Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 190 rita gud machoum, if you understand what means. It means restitution. It\u2019s not really the right word. Was not much success, but the fact for the millions of people that perished, I was able to make up for the losses, if only one to one million. Six million Jews -- some people ask me jokingly if I\u2019m trying to make them all up again. So, all I could is six. And the -- like I said, the summary of my life after the concentration camps, the best [indecipherable] good amount of restitution was not my success, but the fact that for the millions of people that perished, I was able to make up some of the losses. [indecipherable]. My anger with God, and we talked about anger before, and this with God, being the only survivor of the Willner family, out of 28, has changed to thankfulness, permitting me to forgive God, and not the other way around. I can truly say that my mission in life has been accomplished, and I will be able to peacefully rest some day among some of my liberators at Arlington National Cemetery. I feel very strongly about that. And that\u2019s past life. I can truly say that really, some of these men a-are known to me by name, but I know th-they died during World War two, that Arlington Cemetery, who paid with their lives, so that others like myself might live. And every time I walk through Arlington, I know occasionally on some holiday, I put some flowers down, and some [indecipherable] of World War two soldier, and my oldest son does the same thing, we just go and [indecipherable] and we -- he was also married in the chapel [indecipherable] military by a non -- I forgot what they call it -- non-demonush -- demon- denominational chaplain, army chaplain. I feel that America 1s blessed with many things, and I think particularly -- I\u2019m particularly thankful for the freedoms of speech, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 19] which has been especially meaningful for me, the freedom of speech. I\u2019m not talking about [indecipherable] but the most impressive thing that I still think about all the time, is freedom of speech. I can say anything I want, and not have to worry, even when I had my government job. I can say I don\u2019t like this president, and I don\u2019t have to worry about somebody standing at my door, and arresting me. Well, now to Albert\u2019s military career. Albert, the oldest one -- and by the way, my wife and I agreed before we got married, that we would like to have probably four children, and soon, because we got married, both, at an old age. I was 32 almost, and she was 30. And religion was going to be no problem. I only stated that I want my children to grow up with the Jewish religion, not because I\u2019m SO Ss -- going to the synagogue, keep all the things my faith asks of me, because my parents died as Jews. In their memory, and my wife agreed, I felt if I had met another wife, who said, \u201cWell I\u2019m a Protestant, or a Catholic, but I got to [indecipherable] my faith,\u201d she would have become Jewish, I would have asked her to, but -- but I felt that\u2019s not necessary, like I said before. What\u2019s in -- what\u2019s in your heart, that\u2019s what\u2019s important. In her case, I knew particularly what was -- so Albert was born in Germany, then went to American schools, some overseas in Japan. And finally he went to college here in the United States, and he got an ROTC schol -- ROTC scholar -- scholarship. And he happened to come out as the number one man in his class, and the first man that the -- top man who gets the scholarship at that time -- not gets a scholarship, c-comes out on top, the first guy in his class, is offered a regular army commission, which is you can become a professional army officer. And I told him to take it, if he didn\u2019t like it, he can USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 192 always leave the army later. So I wasn\u2019t aff -- afforded that opportunity, I came out a harder way, through officer candidate school. I\u2019m sorry, I have to drink some water first. My voice is going out. So, to make a real, real long story short, after I finish the ROTC, and he -- he majored in political science, and he went into the army, got a regular commission, then became a paratrooper, became a ranger, studied Chinese for three years, went to China for one year on an educational tour, just traveling around for one year. Then became a -- what they call a foreign area officer, studies foreign areas, they must know the language. And then he didn\u2019t think that he should be just a soldier at a desk, he should be a combat soldier. And I must say also, frankly, that I feel what happened in World War two, when Jews were not able to defend themselves, I didn\u2019t want my children to be in a position -- you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s -- could happen. There are people who would -- don\u2019t like Jews, and I -- I think German Jews particularly have been criticized why they went to the places of killing, like sheep. Well, nobody had a gun. In Germany nobody owned a gun, my father didn\u2019t own one, although my uncle owned a saber, which he brought back from World War two, but -- so I was very particular s -- I felt very strongly about getting a military education, in the same time serving your country, and seeing to it that we remain a democracy. And the army can be responsible, to a certain extent, provided we have the right leaders. And Albert went in, and then, since he wanted to become a combat soldier, not sit down and some -- somebody telling him, oh you\u2019re just a desk officer, he went to attack helicopters, and he was -- he was taught to fly Cobra attack helicopters, which were very successful during USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 193 several wars. And then he became commander of -- of -- of the unit. Then he got promoted to major, and then every officer who wants to stay in the army, ma-make the career today, must have a Master\u2019s degree in one field or another. So the army gave Albert 18 months to go to the University of Virginia, and get a Master\u2019s degree within 18 months. Well, again, to make a long story short, he finished his Master\u2019s degree in foreign relations in nine months instead of 18 months. So he -- one professor was Chinese, one of his three professors that he got close to. He said, \u201cAlbert, you finished [indecipherable] what are you going to do now?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cgo back to the army. Take whatever job they give me.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are Ph.D. material, you know that. So,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you stay on and we\u2019ll be your sponsors.\u201d But he had to make request to the army, and the army said -- no, first the professor wrote the army. We have a young officer here, who finished 1n a -- 1n eight -- in -- in nine months, when most people have 18 months to finish it. Can he stay here and go on to a Ph.D.? Well nobody can finish a Ph.D. in nine months, they knew that. So he was told then, if he studies on his own afterwards, they\u2019Il let him stay another nine months. So he stayed another nine months at UVA, and he didn\u2019t finish of course, but he studied very hard. He was married already at that time, and his family left him alone at night when he was studying. Well, make a -- he finished his Ph.D. in three years, and then the army send him to China, like I said, and then he went again into hel-helicopters, and when he finished that job, he needed a job th -- for further promotion, he got that in Germany for three years, and his -- then the next assignment was in Washington, the Pentagon. He was the war plants officer USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 194 for the Far East. In other words, he was responsible for the planning if there was any attack in the Far East, in Japan, Korea, China. That was the area of responsibility. And he\u2019s now a lieutenant colonel, and two years ago he was interviewed for teaching at West Point. And it\u2019s very difficult to get a professorship there, and there are two ways. You can stay just for two years, on a regular assign -- or you can be -- ask to make it rest of your career. If you do, you get a further promotion, you\u2019re assured to leave the army as a one star general. And so he went to West Point. He loves it, his wife loves it. They are living one block from the river, and his teaching is very nice, he likes it, he enjoy -- he always wanted to teach. And I\u2019m glad he did it, with his background. And I mentioned to- him before, in another part of the interview that he followed my Death March in Poland for one week -- for two -- for two weeks, and he retraced everything during the winter. And he has many o-other endeavors that he did, pertaining to the Holocaust. So it\u2019s very close then he -- I don\u2019t have to tell him. He will -- he has now all of my papers that he will organize, and go through, and he [indecipherable] source with my family, if any [indecipherable] for the Holocaust, he has the records, and he will get the -- the interview tape, too. So I\u2019m very proud of Albert, he has accomplished enough, at a young age, and he\u2019s a great guy, and he has done many things to his -- my -- for instance, for as far as mother\u2019s concerned, on his birthday he delivers -- or has delivered flowers to his mother for having me born. And they have a very good relationship with both father and mother. And the worst thing that I am concerned with, that if ever I ha -- anything happens to me [indecipherable] children are good hands [indecipherable] why I was taken USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 195 care of, but I am worried about having to go to an old people\u2019s home one day. I don\u2019t think that will happen unless medically, it\u2019s impossible to keep at home, because I have six children who will fight over having me in the house. So anyway, that\u2019s a good thought. Whatever happens, now that\u2019s another story. And they will take care of their mother."

            "question": "Wh-What about your other children?",
            "answer": "Okay. We come to Nicole, our oldest daughter. Our oldest daughter was impressed by older son\u2019s beginnings in ROTC. She didn\u2019t have ROTC when she started college -- and by the way, I must explain about education. I was a male chauvinist, I must admit that, coming from Europe, from Germany. German, and whether Jewish or not, most men were sh -- male chauvinists. And when I came to United States [indecipherable] start in having children, I thought, not having too much money, that the boys must go to college. Well very soon my [indecipherable] by my wife, and m-my daughters, and I felt in -- marriages sometimes don\u2019t last very long here. The women have to have profession, too, so they can make their own living. And I said, \u201cWell, the money\u2019s not going to have me split three ways to go to college, it\u2019s going to be six ways from now on.\u201d So how do I do that? Well, I know how much money was avail -- and I had no experience with college, because nobody had st -- had started yet, and Albert was going to start. So I said, \u201cOne thing Ill assure you of, the first year\u2019s assured, for everybody. I -- I pay for it. After that you\u2019re on your own.\u201d So I want to put a taste in their mouths what college 1s like, not to say I go to work first, and like I have a lot of people that let their children go to work for USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 196 a year, and they make so much money, and they don\u2019t want to get a college degree. You know, why should I go to college, I can make more money not going? So I didn\u2019t want that to happen, since I like -- like the education. I picked some up in the army, picked up a degree in the army, but not like my oldest son. Because my main interest was a family, not -- not studying. So some of them wound up with scholarships, or part scholar -- and I made sure that, of course, they started first year, that was on me, and anything else later on will have to be scholarships, or borrow money from a bank, or from me, if -- 1f -- if nothing -- if you don\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t get the money, but you pay me back, because we have to get some money for your mother to be on her own someday. I don\u2019t want her to be dependent on you. I -- I want her to have enough to live on if something happens to me. So they all agreed. And I said, \u201cIf you need any money at the end of your college time, the fourth year, and the third year, and you can\u2019t get any loans because your dad makes too much money, or whatever, you can borrow money from me, and no interest. And you pay me back when you can, when you start working.\u201d And that\u2019s what happened every one of them. The three last ones owed me each -- I don\u2019t know how much they owed me, but somewhere around 10,000 dollars each. And I -- I agreed that -- like I said, no -- no interest. If they can pay, they pay me back [indecipherable] hundred dollars a month. And if they good -- good at it, paying back the money they owe me, said they owe me no interest. I will let them off when I can afford to. So as it turned out, the last three owed me about six, seven, 8,000 dollars, and I was at a point in time when I was making good money with the government, I said you all paid me back, what you could every month, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 197 and y -- I -- I wrote it off, you don\u2019t owe me any money any more. Because I could afford, there was nobody else going to college. So they all understood, and they all were helping, and they were -- and they continue to do so. So we go to Nina. Nina, or Nicole, who is 39, the oldest daughter, is a terrific girl. After she saw her mother doing these things in the military, and getting paid for it also, she volunteered after two years in college, to go out to ROTC. In the meantime, her brother was a battalion commander, not really, but like -- but that the ROTC battalion commander. And she got also a commission as a second lieutenant, and they gave me the honor to -- if I can appear in uniform, to be at the Pentagon, or at the college, and pin the bars on my daughter. And so one side was her brother, and the other side was me, pinning second lieutenant bars on her. So she became a captain in the army, then she met her husband, she was Intelligence in Berlin, very interesting career. She was, since she studied psychology, they put her in Intelligence too, and she was dealing with the Russians in Berlin. We visited her, we went to east Berlin. She went in uniform, because the Russians had an agreement, they don\u2019t touch Americans. The east Germans wanted to, but they were not allowed to touch us, It was a very interesting experience. But anyway, Nina became a captain, then met her husband at the advanced Intelligence school in -- and she married a guy who was Catholic, but he agreed that the children were now Jewish. So she got out of the army, he\u2019s now a lieutenant colonel, he was -- his last job was -- he was military attache -- defense attach\u00e9 in Belarus, which is white Russia, or the city of Minsk, where a lot of Jews lived, and still live. They have three synagogues there, and my daughter used to go Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 198 with her husband to the Dubabitchka synagogue in Minsk. And he finished his tour last year. They live here in Anendale, and she still brings her children up the Jewish way. She has one boy and two girls. And she educates them a very nice way, play the violin, play the piano, and so on. And her husband has been offered now, the next assignment as a military attach\u00e9 to Czechoslovakia, to Prague. And I said, \u201cTake it, take it. That\u2019s a nice place to go to, Prague.\u201d We -- my wife and I have been there one time. And so Nina 1s very successful in many ways, particularly bringing up her children the proper way. And she did the right thing to leave the army. She was a good soldier, she\u2019s a good mother, particularly sh-she studies ecology, which [indecipherable] in the army, no, she was near the mother. So, we come to the third child, Marcel, who is money-wise, the most successful of all. He worked for a congressman, for our congressman as an intern. Well, first of all he went and he -- he got an appointment to the Air Force Academy. After two years, his eyes were turning bad, he wanted to become an engineer, and a jet pilot. But in this -- when he almost finished his second year, he was told by the air force that he\u2019s not going to fly, because eyes were getting bad from reading too much, but he was going to become an engineer, besides being a pilot. And he said, \u201cWell, what I g -- what am I going to do, I\u2019m not going to fly?\u201d \u201cWell, you go to missile silo when you graduate.\u201d He said no. I\u2019m not going to missile silo and be stuck two years the underground. And he said, \u201cI\u2019m resigning from the academy.\u201d Which he did. And I had told him, \u201cWell, you\u2019re on your own. You had a [indecipherable], you had to stay four years afterwards, so five years. And you going to go do something else, but you\u2019re putting me in a -- in a bind with USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 199 money, whi -- I was hoping you would get -- I wouldn\u2019t have to pay a penny for you at the academy, but you quit.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Pop, don\u2019t worry.\u201d He went to the Virginia Polytechnic in He was good at math, and he got a -- first of all he got his two years credit from the academy, because h -- if you leave after two years, you have a commitment, and he left when he had two years, just in time. So he didn\u2019t have to pay anything back, and he got his degree in Applied Mathematics. Short story that when he came out, he worked for the congressman, like I said, and then he applied -- and -- and -- at the high school that his -- his high school as substitute math teacher. Well, then he became -- he was also winner in north -- northern Virginia wrestling matches, that\u2019s why the academy was also interested in him, besides other things. Well, then he want his first job, he wasn\u2019t make any money with the congressman, that was free for the congressman. But he was getting half a day at the school, he was getting paid for that. He said, \u201cI gotta make more money.\u201d So, he applied for a first job, and he gives a reference the congressman, one of the Beltway bandits, if you know what that -- people getting contracts from the government. And the person interviewed him said, \u201cDo you have any references?\u201d Well, the school, and the congressman. Well he called both of them, and the congressman took the phone himself, and he said, \u201cIn my 10 years as a congressman, I never had a better intern.\u201d"

And he moved up very quickly, and since then, again to make a long story short, in order to get ahead you have to change companies sometimes. He went to work for Merck, big pharmacirculated company. And so Merck, he was a director at Merck, and he moved about -- well, he moved from Merck to Brussels for two years. He was the European representative for Merck, and he got a big computer system started over there. And his -- he made a name for himself.

His parents were here, they\u2019re very Jewish, from New York, and he\u2019s a great guy. They all married -- they have all great partner, every one of them. And their -- their philosophy, or their desire 1s, if he doesn\u2019t fit in the family, I\u2019m not going to marry him, or her. And they all fit in. We have the best all of six -- one is not married, the last one, of course. They all -- we all get along, just not the in-laws, and they get along with us, and they get along with each other. And they all kind -- we have three of them living nearby, they wanted to be sh -- be sure they take care of their parents, some of them, so one of them lives in Princeton, Marcel, and Albert at West Point, and the rest of them live around here."

            "answer": "Okay, I will pick up some of the in-laws that I -- I don\u2019t mention much about them, about who they are. Albert\u2019s wife -- her father was a naval officer on an aircraft carrier, he was also a pilot. He\u2019s a very nice guy, he is also retired, and lives in Alabama. Nicole\u2019s husband I mentioned, is also military, 1s also lieutenant colonel, recently in Belarus as a military attache. Great guy. And he and Albert are probably the -- the two [indecipherable] that are close together of all the kids because they in the military. Marcel\u2019s wife speaks fluent French, was working for a big advertising -- not advertising firm, people who deal with money, and making up taxes for a big firm [indecipherable], I forgot the name. She does not work, she takes care of the two boys. Marguerite, I said, was just married to a Jewish guy, who is also in finance. They don\u2019t have no children, they live 10 minutes from here. Now we come to Satcheco. Satcheco, of course, was born in Japan. She is my daughter, and my wife\u2019s daughter, but we gave her a ja -- a-- a Japanese name, because we liked living in Japan. She\u2019s 33 now. She has an unusual job. She is a adjudicator with the Virginia employment office, but actually she deals in unemployment, that\u2019s her specialty. She is in charge of a group who handles cases that have been rej -- routinely rejected. And she gets a second opinion on it, and a decision whether people should get unemployment or not, depending on whether they quit their job, or they were fired, or [indecipherable]. So the n-name of adjudicator 1s not the real Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 203 name, that is the professional name. She\u2019s also -- she called a -- I forgot what it -- it\u2019s like an administrative judge, I -- I -- I can\u2019t think of the name right now. Satcheco has the Japanese name, is named after a friend of ours. I mentioned the general and his daughter, who come -- who -- who had a daughter who still comes to see us here once a year. And she likes her name. She doesn\u2019t look Japanese, which surprises everybody when she goes- they always look for Japanese [indecipherable] call her name. She\u2019s 33, and she married a guy and he\u2019s of Chinese descent. He is a engineer, working for the U.S. patent office. And he is only Chinese in looks, a typical American boy. His father\u2019s already born here, he\u2019s a [indecipherable] engineer. His mother was born in China, came here as a young girl. And she had a li -- a very big marriage, of all Chinese people, about 250 of them, less -- a ye -- about a year ago, and she\u2019s now pregnant. And she keeps on working, and her husband, like I said, works for the patent bureau, and he does everything we want. He is not religious in any way, but he\u2019ll go to synagogue if you want him to, but he does not -- [indecipherable] synagogue. But they both think cooked Chinese food 1s very good. I think that\u2019s how they got together. But she\u2019s pregnant now, so she has to watch herself. And he 1s a great guy, as an in -- son in -- we -- we don\u2019t call them son-in-laws, we just call them -- they call me Pop, and I -- I call them by their name. So his name is Darren, and the last one 1s Michael, the youngest one, who 1s really outstanding in a different way. He\u2019s a big -- a real scholar. He went to UVA, and College of William and Mary for one year. He also had a military scholarship, but he didn\u2019t take advantage of it. It -- the military were not for him, and that was okay. So he got himself a degree in USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 204 foreign affairs. He is now working on the Master\u2019s at the Georgetown University Foreign Service School, and he will graduate as a diplomat, I guess, up there. And he -- in the meantime, he was awarded by the Department of Defense -- he worked this summer, he borrowed all the money to go to Georgetown, because I wasn\u2019t willing to pay for Georgetown, he\u2019s 30 years old, he can do some work in the meantime, which he did. He got himself employed by Department of Defense, in the Pentagon, in the Joint Staff, as an analyst for National Security Affairs. And he was picked, he didn\u2019t know it when he started that two people get picked in the Pentagon, but he had to go to a new school. They gave out regular degree, and Master\u2019s degrees in National Security. And there was an article in the paper, he told me down there, I didn\u2019t read it, Washington Post, about this new university, or -- if it\u2019s called university, I don\u2019t have the name right now, but it\u2019s in - and the school gives out is -- is -- 1s qualified on the national whatever, to graduate people Master\u2019s degrees in national security affairs. [indecipherable] just started a school where you finish in one year, get his Master\u2019s. In meantime he gets 35,000 dollars, in addition, for his living expenses. But he lives here, but he will move out with a good friend of his into an apartment in December. So he doesn\u2019t have to pay anything here, food is free, the good food of his mother, which he will miss, and he lives in the basement, that\u2019s his territory. I never know he\u2019s here, not here, and I don\u2019t have to pay a penny for his upkeep, or for -- he takes care of all this himself. He\u2019s terrific son, he\u2019s our baby, a mother\u2019s baby. So that\u2019s the children, I don\u2019t think I left anybody out. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 205"

I had a Jewish teacher, and he was more German than the Germans. And I -- he was so strict, my father was very strict, that when I found him living in the United States, in New York, after the war, he had not escaped to New York with his wife, no children, but he had been hidden by two German f-families who were both schoolteachers like he was, and hidden throughout the war. It would have cost them their lives if they were found out. That was my teacher, my strictest teacher, a guy I probably hated at the time, who hit me a million times, and then I got it when I came home, from my father, I got double dosage. So when I finally found him, he was 75, or 80 years old in New York, I went -- I called him up first. I found out coincidentally, in a German Jewish newspaper which I read, and in a announcement of somebody die -- oh yeah, the people went Shanghai, I mentioned to you before, the girl that was in my class. She said, \u201cYou know, our old teacher lives in New York?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cMr. Damon lives in New York, he came after the war.\u201d I said, \u201cYou got his number? I want to call him.\u201d I called him up same evening, and Mr. Damon said, \u201cOh yeah, Willner, Willner, I remember you.\u201d And I said, bull, he can\u2019t remember, he had thousands of kids. And he doesn\u2019t remember me. Maybe he remembers me for some of the bad things I did. So he said -- I said to him for a joke, \u201cWell, Mr. Damon, I remember you, too, very well.

Well, he was very nice about it, he didn\u2019t insult anybody. And he -- I read the letter to a group of about 500 Germans [indecipherable], and maybe 100 Jews, who came back from different -- from Brazil, from Israel, or -- and I could -- I became so emotional during the -- reading his -- his letter that one German came up to me, a newspaper guy, he said, \u201cWould you read it in front of German TV station?\u201d I -- I said I would. That was the greatest thing, I read it for my schoolteacher, because he bared himself, and he took them to task, but in a nice way. And he also didn\u2019t suffer, he was hidden, he could say something good, and not just bad about the Germans. The two teachers hid him, and their wives, were not caught, and then sor -- the part that you asked me about Germany, that\u2019s good and bad. And [indecipherable] able -- I -- I tell you s -- one thing, far as that is concerned, hate, or what do you call it, when somebody -- guilt -- oh, collective guilt. I don\u2019t believe in collective guilt, never have. I don\u2019t think that all Germans are guilty. There are many Germans that are guilty, who knew about it, who didn\u2019t lift a finger. I\u2019m not talking about the SS now, the real bad guys. So -- as a matter of fact, I would not be alive today if it wouldn\u2019t be some German, who was somehow -- gave me a piece of bread, extra piece of bread, or [indecipherable] something. So, I said to my wife after the army, what are we going to do Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 209 by going in a civil service job. Well, there were many jobs open in Germany that time, for Americans, and civilian. I said, \u201cI go back and get a job.\u201d \u201cYou would?\u201d Johanna said, \u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019m finished with Germany.\u201d So I changed my mind since, I th -- I think my wife was right. So that part of Germany, so you ha -- you have some good, and some bad, and some people -- I think if you hate people, all people like t -- you believe they\u2019re all guilty, it eats you up eventually, not the other person, the other person didn\u2019t -- probably don\u2019t give a damn. And people are sensitive. I -- I never -- I don\u2019t love the SS or somebody like that, I don\u2019t say that, but that some people were good Germans. So there\u2019s good Jews, and bad Jews. Maybe there were more Nazis then. But I believe today -- for instance, what goes on in Israel [indecipherable] watch TV, I -- I think the Jews have a point. The Arabs who cannot deny them certain things. Unfortunately it\u2019s a situation that is very difficult to solve, if at all. I -- I must -- I made a speech, and I haven\u2019t made many speeches here, about the Holocaust. One was at the high school that our children went to, and the principal was of German descent, not Jewish. He invited me, and he said -- and I couldn\u2019t turn him down. And he -- he not -- not -- he didn\u2019t take the ger -- the history class, at that time [indecipherable] World War two, 1s -- he took 700 kids into the auditorium, and he said, \u201cI want you to listen to Mr. Willner, Albert\u2019s father.\u201d They listened to me, and at the end of my talk -- so I talk about some of the experiences World War two -- at the end of the talk one boy stood up, had a question, and he said to me, \u201cMr. Willner, you think it could happen here?\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s a very good question,\u201d I said, \u201cves, it could. But we have a democratic government. But Germany had a democratic USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 210 government too, when Hitler came to power. It can be turned around like you never know what\u2019s going to happen. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen here, not in my lifetime, I hope, but these people, bad people exist here, too. Who hate, who don\u2019t like Jews, don\u2019t like Blacks, or whatever. And the same people that I saw in SS uniforms in Germany, I have seen them, I\u2019m sorry to say, in our own army. Just put an SS uniform. People who would kill Vietnamese women and children, think nothing of it. Gooks, they were gooks to them.\u201d And people were shocked, particularly the principal, he took me to his office later on, I won\u2019t -- he was shocked because he felt, as a German -- he was born here, his father was German, he said. And I told him, \u201cDr. Toombs, this 1s ridiculous that you even think that way. What responsibility could you have had in what the Germans did because your father is German himself? There\u2019s no such thing as collective guilt, not in my book.\u201d Well, we really became very good friends, of course, we were already. And so these -- and I must add that the same people, some people like that, exist even among the Jews in Israel, who would go kill Arabs just because they\u2019re Arabs. I\u2019m sorry to say, but it -- that\u2019s the way I feel. So these bad people exist in any country, given a chance to do it. [have seen my own army, Lieutenant Calley, who -- who killed women and children in his [indecipherable]. He should not be in -- jailed, his superior should have been jailed. Why? Because they knew he was a killer, and what he was eventually going to do. They should have made him -- his commanding officer should have made a supply officer in the back, where he can\u2019t do any harm, shoot women and children. So these people USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 211 existed. And here, in peace time, the types exist and if they do something bad, they wind up in the penitentiary. In war time they get away with it."

Some of them don\u2019t fight for their country, let some other people fight for their country. And when this happened to this guy who killed -- was killed for Israel, and they couldn\u2019t bury him because the Orthodox wouldn\u2019t let them do it, and he had to be shipped back to Russia, to his mother. I thought [indecipherable]. At that moment I wrote a letter to the United Jewish Appeal, I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have it right now, I don\u2019t even know where I put it. And th-the president or executive director answered it personally. I said, \u201cI will not contribute any money because I know some of your money go -- go to Orthodox Jews, I don\u2019t support Orthodox Jews.\u201d And he wrote me a nice letter.

A shower of death. They were put in there, death started to rain about them. Cries, shouts, screams, prayers, and then death rested on their souls.\u201d He was 12 years old when he wrote that. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 214 And that\u2019s very deep. And we have a few others that some of the other kids wrote, but this, 1t was the one impressed me the most. And this is the kind of education he got mostly through my wife, poetry. She likes to write, she\u2019s writing a book, too. And she wrote lot of poetry. She has stuff accept by Hadassah, the Jewish newspaper, printed. And she had several other things. So, she must take credit for that. Not for writing this, for putting this kind of spirit into him. And when you ask about the grandchildren, I\u2019m sure his children will continue to feel like he does. He\u2019s very quiet about it, but he speaks out when he should. So --"

            "answer": "[indecipherable]. I have not forgotten anything, but I would say that in general, we don\u2019t disagree on any of the things I said, the children and I, because they have seen all the videotapes that have been made, the things that I\u2019ve said. And in talking to them, I\u2019ve confirmed, or reinforced some of the things I\u2019ve said. And the grandchildren I cannot say. I really cannot, to be honest. Some of them frankly will not grow up as Jews, but it doesn\u2019t bother me, as long as they have in their heart, and they know something about their past, that I don\u2019t want the daughter to say, \u201cWell, my husband is Catholic,\u201d -- and in a matter of fact -- well, that\u2019s another story. I\u2019m not going to -- she teach them how to be Jewish, and she can do it. She takes it serious, so does Maggie. So the -- out of the girls be -- the mothers being the ones that\u2019s really educate the children, because they\u2019re home, or because the Jewish religion, the Orthodox say so, that\u2019s fine with me. But I would say Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 215 definitely two [indecipherable] know right now, Marguerite and Nicole are educating their children -- Marguerite doesn\u2019t have any children yet, but she was going the way Nicole goes, and her children, particularly the two daughters, getting a good Jewish education. They belong to a synagogue here. They don\u2019t go much to synagogue, but they go to the re-religious education. And they did the same thing in Minsk."

            "answer": "No, I don\u2019t think so. They -- they aware of it, but why -- why would the Blacks in Africa care about all [indecipherable] their own. Why the many Chinese have been killed in some of the wars, millions. And they -- they don\u2019t think that the way we do, that Jews were killed only because they were Jews, and there were different reasons. For the moment, that\u2019s all still 1n people\u2019s mind, people are still alive, they experience it, but I think another two generation, it will peter out somehow. It -- because they have the [indecipherable] with television now, I -- I will say one thing, or my wife at least thinks so, that if we had a television, it wouldn\u2019t have happened. Not in -- in that -- that way. So I think television will do a lot in the future to prevent things. Well, I-I -- I-I -- I\u2019m very si- sim-simplisistic [indecipherable] as far as that goes. I think the United States, I always felt, we don\u2019t have ma -- many problems as Jews, but other people have, the Blacks. So in a way, if they didn\u2019t have any problems with the Blacks, they probably would have somebody else [indecipherable] would be more. Might be Jews, it might be an Asian, Korean, Japan -- whoever. Or Blacks from Africa. But I don\u2019t think we have too much to worry about here, not in our lifetime.
