We have our businesses here and our houses. And so my father continued to persist for his own family. He would go every day to the American consulate in Vienna but there were no visas to be given at the time. And finally his uncle in Taunton, whose name was Moshe Greenberg, obtained a visa for only three members. He had to choose which of his family should get them. And because my parents were cousins he figured this was the greatest remnant of both sides that he was saving. So that\u2122s how we got the visas. And, but there was no money because the Nazis had shut down my father, my parents\u2122 grocery store and there was no w ay to earn a living except that my father secretly took apart the shelves in the grocery store and made trunks for those Jews who were able to migrate. And the neighbors in the house were very fine because they didn\u2122t report us to the Germans. They must h ave heard the hammering."

And I discovered this only from the note s that Harris was able to get from the Holocaust museum which has the records apparently of the Jewish council who were given the unpleasant job in Vienna of deciding which Jews could leave and which could not. And my father, when he went to the Jewish council, said that he could support himself because his skill was as a trunk maker. That\u2122s what he had done before he opened the grocery store. And he wanted to take with him in addition to his wife and daughter, his mother in law and his niece , Susan. And the Jewish council because they were limited by the Nazis couldn\u2122t allow the, his mother in law who was over the age limit. The age limit was 70 and she was 72 and they denied also Susan coming with them. So Susan escaped with her mother and father and brother Max to Belgium and from there to France and they were imprisoned by Klaus Barbee. So they never made it and \u0152"

            "answer": "A Polish Christian. She owned the house but she took care of me w hile my parents worked. Took me to church. I remember the incense and the going up with her to the altar. But and she was a, what, what the French call a bricoleur [ph] . She made use of what there was. I remember sitting with her in the park and she had bought some vegetables, some carrots and I suppose I was hungry at the time. She wanted to clean the carrots so she bent down, picked up a piece of broken glass, washed it in the fountain and scraped the carrot for me. And this was the very practical wa y that she lived. She raised chickens. And I being a naughty four year old used to love to chase the chickens. Thurusta [ph] would get very angry with me that I was chasing his flock but that was my early childhood there. And if we can go back to Vienna for a minute, I\u2122d like to tell you the story of my aunt Toni who was in the resistance. And this, Toni was the child of the second wife of my paternal grandfather and his second wife. Toni was in the resistance and they lived in an apartment house where the postmaster and his family lived. One day there was a knock on the door and I believe this was in 1938 or maybe toward 1939 and there was the postmaster in Gestapo uniform. And my grandfather said Herr so and so you\u2122ve joined the Gestapo and the postmaster said I had to, to protect my family, but I\u2122ve come to warn you. The Gestapo is coming for your daughter. She must leave immediately. So Toni ran down the back steps, around the corner. The Gestapo were putting her compatriots in the resistance into the car. She escaped and was sent later by the Russians to a camp in Siberia. She played the mandolin there, Russian music and worked in the camp that the Russians had sent. And one day she was walking back from w ork and this man followed her and he said I don\u2122t mean to frighten you but you look very familiar to me. W here are you from? She said Vienna. He said, what street. Yeah the same street. What number house? It turned out to be Adolf, my father\u2122s eldest brother and because he had, with his siblings left the house at an early stage when the step mother came in, they hadn\u2122t recognized each other. Adolf too had been sent by the Russians to this camp. Adolf unfortunately died. Typhoid was endemic Interview with Rosa Weinstein September 19, 2013 16 in the camp and he died of typhoid. Toni met her future husband there, Eli and they migrated to Israel in 1948. And they lived in these primitive huts that Israel had set up and later moved to Nazareth Elit . Eli and Toni had two children, Soshi and Jacob, named after the grandfather. And Soshi became the principal of a high school in Nahary ia [ph] . Since she was the principal of the high school she thought her charges should see Europe and where they came from and she took them to Poland. Auschwitz and visited. And then on the way they stopped in Vienna and they wanted souvenirs to bring back to families in Israel. And they went into a candy store and who should be the owner of the candy store, the daughter of the postmaster who had warned Ton i and his family. And so they had a marvelous reunion. I suppose that they started talking. Where are you from ? My mother Toni is from Vienna and the rest followed. And my aunt actually went from Israel to Vienna to visit Ami. Ami unfortunately died befo re we got to Vienna so I didn\u2122t have a chance to meet her. S o that was the amazing coincidence there. But life is full of coincidences isn\u2122t it. So we came to America and I enrolled in public school there. And \u0152"

Much the way, people put a sheaf of grain in their icons. There was a sheaf of grain under Roosevelt\u2122s picture and she said do you know who this is. And I don\u2122t remember whether I knew at the time that it was Roosevelt. And I said something or other and she said how come? And this phrase would not translate itself in my mind. How come. How come. And this was how I began to learn English with its colloquialisms. Its idioms.

You \u0152 I realize later what I do is what the Japanese call bushido , the warrior, the samurai will di stance themselves from the emotion of the time so that they could fight. They would distance themselves from fear, anger and simply concentrate on what they have been trained to do and I find myself doing that in difficult situations. I set myself apart from it, don\u2122t allow myself to feel the emotion so that I can go through what has to be done. And that I think is part of my being a refugee from those times.

But I recognized, I felt the feeling, a memory of the courtyard. And then he, the Polish driver took us to the apartment house. Couldn\u2122t\u2122 find it.

And we went into the clinic and I wanted to ascertain that was the building and because it was a long line of ill people, I didn\u2122t want to break into that line. So I went to an office where there was no one and I said in my poor German, excuse me can I have a quest ion. And they looked up and said get into line. And I said Interview with Rosa Weinstein September 19, 2013 34 but I\u2122m a tourist. I have only a question. Get into line. So we went out of the building and waited til a person with a friendly face came out and then in our bad German, my bad German said can you tell us how old this is. And she said oh it was two years old. So that fit. So it was a perfect site for a medical clinic because Ubahn, the fantastic system, rail system that they have was just a door or two down, so people could make it easily. We went back. We found the house where my grandfather had lived and my aunt Toni which is now in a heavily Muslim building. A man there very kindly asked if we wanted to come inside but we didn\u2122t. we didn\u2122t want to intrude. We didn\u2122t know what apartment it was. So and then we had another driver, a fellow from Turkey who took us to the Friedhoff which is the cemetery where my grandmother, Rosa is buried. This is my maternal grandmother who died in the flu epidemic. And we tried find her grave in the Jewish section. Could not. The Turkish driver was marvelous. He ran up and down the rows trying to find them. Til we finally had to say we\u2122re afraid we have to get to the airport now. We need to stop but he was willing to try. He worked very hard. He was lovely. In contrast, I had a taxi driver from Vienna and well shall I tell you this s tory. He was very angry that he had to drive me to the Marriott which was the edge of Vienna from the center of Vienna and he, I guess from my poor German he understood that I had been there before. And I said yes I was born there. He said why did you leave Austria? It\u2122s a wonderful country. And I thought ach, if I have to explain. There is no sense in it. But that was my meeting with the Austrian driver. So it was, we have been back several times since. And I\u2122ve gone to the wonderful museums. And gives m e a chance to practice my poor German , although invariably when I speak German the Viennese break into English. Show you how bad my German must be. But I try to practice it before we leave so that I can at least get us about Vienna."

He said every Jew is born with a knife in his heart. Of course he was talking about Isaac and Abraham and Isaac and the sacrifice that didn\u2122t take place but I think every Jew feels that and so you worry that your children \u0152 and then it extends even to your grandchildren. It never ends yeah. But then you don\u2122t\u2122 have to be a refugee to worry about your children I think. A Jewish mother, an Italian can be a Jewish mother as well."

It\u2122s a part of our survival tech nique as human beings I think. We are able to what\u2122s the word categorize, compartmentalize thank you. That\u2122s it exactly . We compartmentalize and so we take note of evil when it happens but then we are so busy trying to live that we put it aside. But I thin k the world needs to continue, it needs to be reminded, needs to be reminded. Continually."

Harris was teaching a class there. And the Jagiolian , Jagiellolian, it\u2122s named after Jagiello the king of Poland and he established a law school there. And we\u2122ve been there several times for Harris to teach. And of course Auschwitz is, I have not been, is a half hour to an hour away from Krakow. And I remember one mornin g seeing two couples from England, Christians going to Auschwitz. They were laughing. They didn\u2122t know what they were going to see. I think they were probably going to see the salt mines which are an interesting thing to see also. And they were laughing an d gay. Interview with Rosa Weinstein September 19, 2013 38 They came back utterly drained and gray. And I said to myself, I know just where you\u2122ve been. And I think the world needs to see the Holocaust Museum so they know where the world has been. So I am thoroughly in favor of it. I\u2122m rather glad to see i t, never mind rather. I am glad to see that there are Holocaust museums throughout the country and in Europe as well. A needed reminder, the needed reminder to the world."
