And then my last memory of Vienna 1s our getting into a taxi very hurriedly and my asking why isn\u2019t my grandmother coming with us. And the reason we were leaving so hurriedly was that morning we had received a notice from the Nazis to report to camp. So we left quite, quite hurriedly in the taxi. My parent, my father had been trying to leave Vienna since 1932 when he saw what was happening in Germany."

Let\u2019s all go to South America. And the family said no, it\u2019s, nothing\u2019s going to happen here. It\u2019s Germany. It'll straighten itself out. We have our businesses here and our houses. And so my father continued to persist for his own family. He would go every day to the American consulate in Vienna but there were no visas to be given at the time. And finally his uncle in Taunton, whose name was Moshe Greenberg, obtained a visa for only three members. He had to choose which of his family should get them. And because my parents were cousins he figured this was the greatest remnant of both sides that he was saving. So that\u2019s how we got the visas. And, but there was no money because the Nazis had shut down my father, my parents\u2019 grocery store and there was no way to earn a living except that my father secretly took apart the shelves in the grocery store and made trunks for those Jews who were able to migrate. And the neighbors in the house were very fine because they didn\u2019t report us to the Germans. They must have heard the hammering."

            "answer": "In 1938, right after the Anschluss yeah and I presume that after a while, even that way of earning a living petered out because we had no money after a while to the point that we had to eat in the soup kitchen. And I discovered this only from the notes that Harris was able to get from the Holocaust museum which has the records apparently of the Jewish council who were given the unpleasant job in Vienna of deciding which Jews could leave and which could not. And my father, when he went to the Jewish council, said that he could support himself because his skill was as a trunk maker. That\u2019s what he had done before he opened the grocery store. And he wanted to take with him in addition to his wife and daughter, his mother in law and his niece, Susan. And the Jewish council because they were limited by the Nazis couldn\u2019t allow the, his mother in law who was over the age limit. The age limit was 70 and she was 72 and they denied also Susan coming with them. So Susan escaped with her mother and father and brother Max to Belgium and from there to France and they were imprisoned by Klaus Barbee. So they never made it and \u2014"

            "answer": "A Polish Christian. She owned the house but she took care of me while my parents worked. Took me to church. I remember the incense and the going up with her to the altar. But and she was a, what, what the French call a bricoleur [ph]. She made use of what there was. I remember sitting with her in the park and she had bought some vegetables, some carrots and I suppose I was hungry at the time. She wanted to clean the carrots so she bent down, picked up a piece of broken glass, washed it in the fountain and scraped the carrot for me. And this was the very practical way that she lived. She raised chickens. And I being a naughty four year old used to love to chase the chickens. Thurusta [ph] would get very angry with me that I was chasing his flock but that was my early childhood there. And if we can go back to Vienna for a minute, Id like to tell you the story of my aunt Toni who was in the resistance. And this, Toni was the child of the second wife of my paternal grandfather and his second wife. Toni was in the resistance and they lived in an apartment house where the postmaster and his family lived. One day there was a knock on the door and I believe this was in 1938 or maybe toward 1939 and there was the postmaster in Gestapo uniform. And my grandfather said Herr so and so you\u2019ve joined the Gestapo and the postmaster said I had to, to protect my family, but \u2019've come to warn you. The Gestapo is coming for your daughter. She must leave immediately. So Toni ran down the back steps, around the corner. The Gestapo were putting her compatriots in the resistance into the car. She escaped and was sent later by the Russians to a camp in Siberia. She played the mandolin there, Russian music and worked 1n the camp that the Russians had sent. And one day she was walking back from work and this man followed her and he said I don\u2019t mean to frighten you but you look very familiar to me. Where are you from? She said Vienna. He said, what street. Yeah the same street. What number house? It turned out to be Adolf, my father\u2019s eldest brother and because he had, with his siblings left the house at an early stage when the step mother came in, they hadn\u2019t recognized each other. Adolf too had been sent by the Russians to this camp. Adolf unfortunately died. Typhoid was endemic https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Rosa Weinstein September 19, 2013 16 in the camp and he died of typhoid. Toni met her future husband there, Eli and they migrated to Israel in 1948. And they lived in these primitive huts that Israel had set up and later moved to Nazareth Elit. Eli and Toni had two children, Soshi and Jacob, named after the grandfather. And Soshi became the principal of a high school in Naharyia [ph]. Since she was the principal of the high school she thought her charges should see Europe and where they came from and she took them to Poland. Auschwitz and visited. And then on the way they stopped in Vienna and they wanted souvenirs to bring back to families in Israel. And they went into a candy store and who should be the owner of the candy store, the daughter of the postmaster who had warned Toni and his family. And so they had a marvelous reunion. I suppose that they started talking. Where are you from? My mother Toni is from Vienna and the rest followed. And my aunt actually went from Israel to Vienna to visit Ami. Ami unfortunately died before we got to Vienna so I didn\u2019t have a chance to meet her. So that was the amazing coincidence there. But life is full of coincidences isn\u2019t it. So we came to America and I enrolled in public school there. And \u2014"

Much the way, people put a sheaf of grain in their icons. There was a sheaf of grain under Roosevelt\u2019s picture and she said do you know who this is. And I don\u2019t remember whether I knew at the time that it was Roosevelt. And I said something or other and she said how come? And this phrase would not translate itself in my mind. How come.

            "answer": "No children yet. In my third year of teaching I became pregnant with our daughter and the principal of the school very kindly kept me on til the end of the year. He was a lovely man, Mr. Robinson. I have never forgotten him. The vice principal was a very staid prim spinster and whose brother was the bishop of I believe it was New York. And at the time the Christian school children were dismissed from school for religious school. The Jewish children waited til the end of the school. The dictum came down from the board of education that children were no longer https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Rosa Weinstein September 19, 2013 25 to be dismissed early. I had a student in my class named James who was used to be dismissed for Christian class. He came up to me and said Mrs. Weinstein I have to leave. And I said terribly sorry James. The ruling from the board of education says you need to stay til the end of the school day. He came back the next week and said Mrs. Weinstein I need to leave and my priest says that if you don\u2019t let me go that he will report you to the bishop. I went town to Ms. Flannery his sister, the vice principal and I said Ms. Flannery you are going to get a very bad report about me from your brother and I need to tell you about this. It was the only time in the entire time that I worked in that school that I saw her laugh. And she said don\u2019t worry about a thing. I will take care of it. And from then on poor James never came up to me. But I felt very badly because I was a Jew telling him that he couldn\u2019t be excused but I had to follow the ruling of the school board."

And you end up in having a certain empathy for humanity, whoever they may be. So it\u2019s not a lost childhood in that sense. You gain by it. Also by being stronger. You \u2014 I realize later what I do is what the Japanese call bushido, the warrior, the samurai will distance themselves from the emotion of the time so that they could fight. They would distance themselves from fear, anger and simply concentrate on what they have been trained to do and I find myself doing that in difficult situations. I set myself apart from it, don\u2019t allow myself to feel the emotion so that I can go through what has to be done. And that I think is part of my being a refugee from those times.

A homeless, stateless people is a very vulnerable people. And I remember reading about Hitler and the Armenians and when the Armenian, no one really came to the Armenian aid and Hitler said the world didn\u2019t watch out for the Armenians, therefore we can do the same with the Jews.

But I recognized, I felt the feeling, a memory of the courtyard. And then he, the Polish driver took us to the apartment house. Couldn\u2019t\u2019 find it. We drove around and around and he finally had the wonderful idea to ask a postman and he said oh yes, that building there had been 29 Heligestadt strasse. It was a new modern building.

And we went into the clinic and I wanted to ascertain that was the building and because it was a long line of ill people, I didn\u2019t want to break into that line. So I went to an office where there was no one and I said in my poor German, excuse me can I have a question. And they looked up and said get into line. And I said https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Rosa Weinstein September 19, 2013 34 but I\u2019m a tourist. I have only a question. Get into line. So we went out of the building and waited til a person with a friendly face came out and then in our bad German, my bad German said can you tell us how old this is. And she said oh it was two years old. So that fit. So it was a perfect site for a medical clinic because Ubahn, the fantastic system, rail system that they have was just a door or two down, so people could make it easily. We went back. We found the house where my grandfather had lived and my aunt Toni which is now in a heavily Muslim building. A man there very kindly asked if we wanted to come inside but we didn\u2019t. we didn\u2019t want to intrude. We didn\u2019t know what apartment it was. So and then we had another driver, a fellow from Turkey who took us to the Friedhoff which is the cemetery where my grandmother, Rosa is buried. This is my maternal grandmother who died in the flu epidemic. And we tried find her grave in the Jewish section. Could not. The Turkish driver was marvelous. He ran up and down the rows trying to find them. Til we finally had to say we're afraid we have to get to the airport now. We need to stop but he was willing to try. He worked very hard. He was lovely. In contrast, I had a taxi driver from Vienna and well shall I tell you this story. He was very angry that he had to drive me to the Marriott which was the edge of Vienna from the center of Vienna and he, I guess from my poor German he understood that I had been there before. And I said yes I was born there. He said why did you leave Austria? It\u2019s a wonderful country. And I thought ach, if I have to explain. There 1s no sense in it. But that was my meeting with the Austrian driver. So it was, we have been back several times since. And I\u2019ve gone to the wonderful museums. And gives me a chance to practice my poor German, although invariably when I speak German the Viennese break into English. Show you how bad my German must be. But I try to practice it before we leave so that I can at least get us about Vienna."

Our older daughter in particular because she 1s the first child. But the boys are quite sensitive to it also, quite sensitive as are our grandchildren. I think they are being taught about the Holocaust."

You know Jefferson said that evil can prevail if enough good people don\u2019t do anything and I want them to be alert to anti-Semitism, to wrongs done to any group. Everybody\u2019s got a responsibility to watch for that. But it\u2019s hard. When you grow up in comfortable circumstances it\u2019s hard to imagine it. So we\u2019re a generation already removed from that. So it\u2019s hard to inculcate that in a way but you do what you can when the moment comes, without hammering it in."

He said every Jew is born with a knife in his heart. Of course he was talking about Isaac and Abraham and Isaac and the sacrifice that didn\u2019t take place but I think every Jew feels that and so you worry that your children \u2014 and then it extends even to your grandchildren. It never ends yeah. But then you don\u2019t\u2019 have to be a refugee to worry about your children I think. A Jewish mother, an Italian can be a Jewish mother as well."

It\u2019s a part of our survival technique as human beings I think. We are able to what\u2019s the word categorize, compartmentalize thank you. That\u2019s it exactly. We compartmentalize and so we take note of evil when it happens but then we are so busy trying to live that we put it aside. But I think the world needs to continue, it needs to be reminded, needs to be reminded. Continually."

            "answer": "It is the place. It\u2019s the nation\u2019s capital. People come from all over and they need to come and they need to know. I vividly remember when we went to Krakow. Harris was teaching a class there. And the Jagiolian, Jagiellolian, it\u2019s named after Jagiello the king of Poland and he established a law school there. And we\u2019ve been there several times for Harris to teach. And of course Auschwitz is, I have not been, is a half hour to an hour away from Krakow. And I remember one morning seeing two couples from England, Christians going to Auschwitz. They were laughing. They didn\u2019t know what they were going to see. I think they were probably going to see the salt mines which are an interesting thing to see also. And they were laughing and gay. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Rosa Weinstein September 19, 2013 38 They came back utterly drained and gray. And I said to myself, I know just where you\u2019ve been. And I think the world needs to see the Holocaust Museum so they know where the world has been. So I am thoroughly in favor of it. I\u2019m rather glad to see it, never mind rather. I am glad to see that there are Holocaust museums throughout the country and in Europe as well. A needed reminder, the needed reminder to the world."
