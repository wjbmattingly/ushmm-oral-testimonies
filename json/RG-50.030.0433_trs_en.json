And in Lucien(ph), I had some teachers who tried to teach mostly socialist people, socialist member or, but there were also anti-Semitism, you know, whatever the kids heard at home, bringing back to school and saying stories about Jews and so forth. For awhile we live in a hotel and after that we rented a place. I had my Bar Mitzvah there and I was introduced to Jewish history by a woman named Mila(ph) Raseen(ph) who became a very well known Jewish resistance member.

But the Vichy(ph) government was anti-Semitic because you know they, they put, in effect, regulation that the German did ask them for. We try, for awhile we wanted to go to Spain. Since we were we heard that the Spanish, the Jews from Spanish origin, if they cross over to Spain they would not be taken back to the French, but we didn't pursue that because there were too many children, we had to go over the mountains, so we didn't."

Later on I'll give you, I'll give you an event that took place when the Gestapo arrested us and there was a deal. Part of the deal was that either myself or my grandfather would have to go with them. Where to be, go, go back with the Germans, to be shipped to Dollsee(ph). But that was the choice that was given and from what I'm told, they thought that since I was younger than my grandfather, I had a better chance to survive and I've been a little upset by this during my life because I think it was unjust. But that's history, you can't tell. I came back alive, but he would not have come back alive. But I came back alive, deeply marked. If I would not have been deported, I would have been a different man. I think I've marked, I have been marked much more because I went there very young. Some adults, maybe had their character formed already and it was not as, as strong effect on them as it was on me. Then when the German came, in November 1942, week later, the whole zone along the Spanish border was declared a forbidden zone, especially for the Jews and we left."

We went to Nice and there were the Italians and it was another atmosphere. We stayed in a hotel there for awhile and then we move in , which was also in Italian zone, up in the mountains. The northern Alps, northern Alps. Oh, it was also , So we found an hotel to stay at and we went in a house."

            "answer": "Well, the happy times were the time I was in Lucien and I had my Bar Mitzvah and I had that women Raseen(ph), Mila(ph) Raseen(ph) and teaching us Zionism and Jewish history and putting actually strength in our young minds. And I had friends, I had many, I had many Jewish friends, because we were many Jews that were there, running away and Lucien was also a nice place, it was the mountain we went. We went on hikes, there was snow in the winter, we... But I remember an event that never left me, it must have been the summer 1942 when we went out of sports, playing soccer and when we finished and it was outside town a little bit, was a, a , afew guys, a few children that wanted to see how I was circumcised, had heard that in church or whatever it is. And and they wanted to see, how does it look to have your male part circumcised and they took me by the arm, on the ground and so forth, took off my pants. And this I will never forget and never forgive them. It was part of the anti-Semite atmosphere. I wouldn't say that everybody was antagonistic toward the Jews, but many were and there was also the religious influence and the religious schools, Catholic schools and so forth, it was really a hotbed of anti-Semitism. On the other hand you have the, the secular school and the teachers, which other time, mostly came from the Socialism, Socialist background. I wish they were more sympathetic to the Jews, but not as bad as people reared in the religion, religious, in the Catholic religion and so forth. A lot of people say that the French, you had the big round up in Paris on the 16th of July, where there was a change of mind for. Well, maybe, but as far as I'm concerned, that, the change of sentiment didn't come from the, from the, that , It really switched around six months later, first when the German lost the battle of and went into retreat in Africa and then, couple months later, Stalingrad, that was the turn and in many people's mind, there was this possibility that Germany will lose the war. So that's what I feel."

In the atmosphere was different because the people over there hated the Italians very much, you know, despised the Italians. Actually, I'd become friendly with the Italian soldiers, I remember they used to have a picnic on the, on the grass in a little meadow when I was coming back from school and time they called me up and they were listening to the radio, English radio, BBC and they would give it to me and talk to me and friendly attitude. And we knew that the French to arrest anybody and... But the atmosphere was different that the people of Savoire(ph) were more, I would call today rightist or, and they hated the Italians.

The Czech peoples, they were on the bridges, going over the railroad track. Standing on the bridges and they were throwing us food from the bridge. I remember I grabbed a piece, a piece of bread there, helped me to survive until our arrival in Buchenwald. And the train finally arrived in Buchenwald, I mean probably the Vimar(ph) station. Was frozen. I remember we're covered of snow, ice and we were eating snow at the end, there was nothing more to eat. There were not many people alive still in the wagon when we arrived. And we got off the wagon and it was a certain height from the floor of the wagon to the ground and some people were too weak and when they get off the wagon, they would come hit the floor and they couldn't get up any more, they broke their foot or their legs or, but they didn't get up. Then we had to walk up a slope to get into the camp of Buchenwald, it was located on a hill in that forest, the forest. And we walk up there and we get into the camp, also very crowded, many people. There were no room for us in the barracks, so I fell on the ground, I remember it was snowing and I fell asleep there and I woke up in the morning and I was so cold, so frozen and I couldn't get up. I thought it was the end there. I started to cry and a friend helped me get back on my feet. That's how I survived this time. And that Buchenwald was a different atmosphere . It was not 98 percent or 99 percent Jewish, I mean in Buchenwald you had many non- Jews, mostly non-Jews originally and the camps and the groups were divided by nationality. You had the very important Russian groups, prisoner of war. Ukrainian Germans, Communists."

So I stayed there a month and then I went, I was sent on an outside commando in Olsen(ph), near Hanover(ph), so back on the train, to a little camp up on a hill, to work on a forest, in very bad condition. Nothing to eat, lice, hard work in the forest, no food. People dying from hunger, from disease. And then one day we heard the guns. Gunshells, coming closer and the rumor was that was the British army coming, not far away. And then, hearing that, we knew that we had to go on the road again, pretty soon. Which happened, of course. They took us out of __, we were alive still, back to where I was stationed. A German civilian, seeing us going through the village and so forth, yelling names at us and so forth and back to Buchenwald. Probably, middle of March or so. March 1945, middle of March."

People would die of sickness and bad treatments and so forth. There were crematoriums, crematoriums working close to around the clock, burning their regular, the dead, the corpse that, but when I was there it was not the camp for the Jews, 1t was not for extermination like it was in Auschwitz."

That's where I found all these pictures that I gave you today. I was at the next morning, I think I saw the, the first American soldier, there were two of them walking down the alley. And then, the next day we went up in the and there was nationality, we were singing the Internationale, Communist song. We were told that we were free men again, that we were going to go back home pretty soon. And then the next day, German civilians came to the camp to see the corpse. I remember them coming up with the American soldiers and none of them smiled, but I don't think they had any, still had any pity for us. That was it."

Still have some. Still have some. Last one I had was when I was in a wagon arriving at Auschwitz and we got off the, the wagon and some people that had left two babies in the wagon and when I was down on the ground, I turned around and I saw some inmates taking the babies out and walking away with the babies. That's the last dream I had, the last nightmare. Other nightmares, you go in the selection and you are picked up to go to the gas chamber. Yeah, it's still around. Still be around. Impossible to forget it all. If I'm here today 1s to pass on all these stories, I hope that whoever listens to these stories believe them. It's all truth. It's all truth. Unfortunately I can give, I can't give you the real, all the details because whatever we, I went through and saw and do and, this cannot how to transmit. I think the best one of the best, the most. A deportee transmit the message, from what I read, all the books, it's Primo Lahty(ph). That book, If It Was a Man, is really the description of the life at Auschwitz. That's the best I, I read. And there were others also. of course and but myself I was just a kid, I put my thought on paper when I came back. In June and July 1945, I wrote this essay and journal of captivity and testimony, whatever you want to call it. I had to start it three times, first a draft, that I'm leaving here, the U.S. Holocaust Museum and then a second draft, then a third draft, which I brought with my children to Yad Vashem(ph) in Israel and Jerusalem, I gave to Yad Vashem(ph) the final draft, 1t is stored over there and my children were with me when I give it to them, so I'm leaving a little bit of my testimony behind and I hope it will transmit la memoire, a memory. I did the best I can and I just wish that many of the survivors are still alive, make the effort to come here and to spend a few hours before they disappear, into record, what we went through."
