            "answer": "Yeah, I think so. Eight days. We went through Czechoslovakia and for the first time I had, I saw some help from the outside. The Czech pe oples, they were on the bridges, going over the railroad track. Standing on the bridges and they were throwing us food from the bridge. I remember I grabbed a piece , a piece of bread there, helped me to survive until our arrival in Buchenwald. And the train finally arrived in Buch enwald, I mean probably the Vimar(ph) station. Was frozen. I remember we're covered of snow, ic e and we were eating snow at the end, there was nothing more to eat. There were not many people alive still in the wagon when we arrived. And we got off the wagon and it was a cer tain height from the floor of the wagon to the ground and some people were too weak and when they get off th e wagon, they would come hit the floor and they couldn't get up any more, they broke their foot or their legs or, but they didn't get up. Then we had 28 to walk up a slope to get into the camp of Buchenwald, it was lo cated on a hill in that forest, the________________forest. And we walk up there and we get into the camp, also very crowded, many people. There were no room for us in the ba rracks, so I fell on the gr ound, I remember it was snowing and I fell asleep there and I woke up in the morning and I was so cold, so frozen and I couldn't get up. I thought it was the end there. I started to cry and a friend helped me get back on my feet. That's how I survived this time. And that Buchenwald was a different atmosphere __________. It was not 98 percent or 99 percent Jewish, I mean in Buchenwald you had many nonJews, mostly non-Jews originally and the camps and the groups were divided by nationality. You had the very important Russian groups, prisoner of war. Ukrainian Germans, Communists."
