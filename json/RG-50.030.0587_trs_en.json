So he took all th e Torahs and stood them up. And he saw a box there, so he took one Torah, he put it into this box, and he took the silverware that was there, the breastplate, the \u0152 the silver hand and the crown and he put all that into the box, and he closed the box up. Well, I am not sure, but the \u0152 when they found this Torah after the war, there in the box with all that, it had to be the Torah my father had put in there, cause what probably happened, I surmise that they came \u0152 the Gestapo came by to pick up all these items, and there\u2122s this box there, they didn\u2122t look in it, and it was left. And so mebody probably would say, oh my God, there\u2122s Torahs here. If they catch me with this, they\u2122re going to cut my head off, send me a concentration camp or do someth ing.
