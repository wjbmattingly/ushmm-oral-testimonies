The commandant of this school, by the name of Rosenbaum, greeted us with selecting one tenth of the transport, ten people, and he shot in front of us the ten young healthy men. It was -- this time it really, we realize that the German mean what they were saying, that they have to destroy the Jews. We lived there in Rabka. The Jewish Interview with Henry Kolber 11 community of this Rabka was assigned to prov ide food and shelter for us. And we lived there and went to the school. That was a ve ry short walk, maybe ten minutes' walk, every morning. We walked there in the beginning.

And we heard that the ghetto in St ary Sacz, because eventually my parents were also moved from the village where we lived to a ghetto, Stary Sacz, that the ghetto going to be liquidated and everybody going to go -- be sent. So on this particular week, we all got the permit from Rosenbaum to go home to say goodbye to our families. I don't really know if our parents knew exactly the condition because we did not share every brutality as what happened to us and what we have seen to the parents, at least I will speak for myself. I felt that there's no point to burden the parents what is going on with us. They had enough problems of their own. So I di d not share too much. I went with general ideas, what's going on, that -- but I did not inform them. They knew that they killed ten of us because ten never came home. But what we were doing, that we were gravediggers and we buried people, I did not share this with them. But there was a general feeling that more or less they knew that they will go to some camp. An d Sunday, when we had to go back home, my father took the group, because we still had a couple horses, from the Interview with Henry Kolber 14 ghetto to the train station. It was not a long ride but it was much better to give us a ride than we should walk because there was no other way to get there. So he came there to say goodbye to us. And I said goodbye to him already and went back almost to the train. And in the last minute, I decide to go back and I jumped over the fence, because by the train station there was a fence, to say anothe r goodbye to my father. And the SS guard saw me and started beating me. And it's not the pain of my -- what hurt me but the feeling of my father, who was he lpless, that he could not help anything to his son. That was more painful. But eventually we got away. And a fe w weeks later we found out that the ghetto from Stary Sacz was sent to Treblinka. We knew very well what Treblinka was. Treblinka was just a camp where people went to be killed, gassed. Meanwhile, those actions in Rabka continue in much bigge r pace than originally because apparently they felt that this part of Poland has to ____________ (youthenlate) -- euthanized (please check) and they will have to kill more. So then it was almost every day that he created an action. Rosenbaum, when the graves were re ady, dug, we dug almost from the morning into like 4:00, then he inspected all those, if they're larg e enough. Then we went to the quarters, where we lived. We had some food. And we were ordered in the evening to come back and watch the actions. He grouped the people by th e graves. They had to be disrobed, put the clothes on the side, and stay by the ditch. He generally gave the SS men some whiskey and -- oop, sorry -- gave an order to shoot. Take this away? No. After the graves were filled, we had to throw the dirt with some disinfectant. And next morning we cut the -- make like sod from further away and brought cover, that there was no, any evidence that there were graves there. Interview with Henry Kolber 15"

In 1968, he came back home to Hamburg and he told the German authority that he's back from the war, he was in the Wehrmacht, that's the army, and he likes to get a pension from the German govern ment. When I arrived to United States, I register for Wiedergutmachung to the -- from German and I got all the -- I gave this organization all the information, which cam ps I spent and what the name of the commandant were there. So they contacted the German -- the German authority contacted, apparently, the Jewish organization and they got my name. And they send me, first, the prosecutor from the trial sent me a telegram if I am willing to come and first recognize -- they show me pictures of him and I recognize him, if I am willing to go to Hamburg to testify to his trial. In the beginning, I was quite hesitant because it was only '68. I started -- I was married. I had two young children. And to renew the wounds was quite hard for me. But after discussion with my wife, we decide that it's my duty, because there was really, there were only three left from the whole group who were in Rabka who could testify as witnesses to his atrocities. So we went to Hamburg and testified. I had my wife and my two children, then I had only two, right now I have three children, to Germany and I, I testified for, I think, three days there to his trial. And, I don't know, I had a feeling when I was in camp with him that he was a big statue, big, heavy-built man. After I met him on the witness stand, he was just a normal, small -- so apparently his authority of life and death, wh ich he had make in our mind, the statue so big. And he got convicted and he got life in pr ison. I don't know. I didn't follow this up, if he's still alive or he's out of his -- but at least that was a satisfaction, that, after all, he killed enough Jews but he did not kill everybody. There were some who could witness Interview with Henry Kolber 17 his -- and give witness to the future generatio ns. And he was punished. Of course I don't feel that the punishment was -- met the crime but here at least he was punished. And then I -- with the Germans, the young people, I have to say that at this time when we were there, we were treated quite nice. And the Germans had, at the time when we were there, some also guilt feeling because they, I presume they had to ask the fathers where were your grandfathers at this pa rticular time, what did you do during the war. So there was some, I don't know, maybe I'm not -- I had some sympathy with them."

And the Germans, the guards got panicky and started to run away from us. And how we were conditioned through this four years, we could not decide for ourselves what to do. So we followed them. We knew very well that there is no way to escape because we were with this blue and white stripes. It's winter. You could not disrobe yourself. And you could not go to a German house.

Not always they did the best in my opinion what in their position required. The one who criticize, let him put himself sometimes in a position of the other one. You know they were required to do certain things by the German authorities there and they had to do, otherwise they would be puni shed. And so in April Interview with Henry Kolber 27"

So I had two eggs. Eggs were very valuable in camp. I would have gotten something in camp for that. So the guard randomly looked, he said, \"open it.\" He looked in my canteen and started stirring with his stick and he found the eggs so I was selected on a side.

So you had to quickly you had to learn the German.

Some Jewish organization, the Zi onist organization, because originally we went to Switzerland just for a little health and then go to Israel, because that's the only place we could go. We did not want to go back home to Poland, because we heard about the seven who escaped, escaped the Germans. They came home and they didn't live long because there is one who survived who is in Israel told us because I met him there to the trial he was the one who escaped, six, the poles came with hatchet and killed them. So we did not want to go back to Poland and there was no other place to go, so we decided to go to Switzerland and then go to Israel. But unfortunately England ha d a blockade to Israel and Switzer land did not permit we could have gone on our own through the borders of Italy, but that's whole thing was illegally and we felt at least the whole group who was in Switzerland from Buchenwald, we decided that we had enough smuggled then, whatever will be when there will be permitted to go here or there we will go. So friends of my parents my name our names were published in Jewish papers in I suppose, through the whole world but here we speak about in United States. And one day I received a letter from friends of my parents who came here much earlier to United States, if I am willing to come to United States they will send me papers.

Where was the Jewish comm unity of the United States where we were there? Today we know that was well known in 1942 that what Hitler was doing with the Jews. It is known also that when Eichmann came to Hungary, because Hungary was the last bastion of Jews, the Jewish community in Hungary saved about 10,000 Jews for money. And they were paid and when they were asked United States government or United St ates Jewish community were asked to donate more money for some reason, somehow, it was not forthcoming. So sure the blame lies directly on those people who helped Hitler or Germany, but the numbness of the world, of the demographic committee in United States, I s till cannot understand. A ship of German refugee came here to this shores and was turned around and sent back."

Why they never threw at least one or two bombs at the trains which were coming to Auschwitz with the people who di ed? We were realized the people would have been killed, but they were killed anyway. But the crematoriums or the trains would be wrecked for a couple of days or weeks and at least the destruction would not have occurred as occurred. So Hitler did not hear really any opposition from no one. So he continued to do what his goal was. I get many questions, why the Jew resisted. My answer to them is I resisted for every day, because his aim was to kill me and I am still alive. So what resistant would it be, I me an I am speaking about my personal thing, would it have been better if I would escaped and hide someplace and be killed later by a Pole and I knew from right from the beginnin g we were told in Rabka, that you are responsible for your neighbor, for your person who you are liv ing or who you are working, if he escapes you be killed. I never, never through the whole my living in camps had any time, notion, of taking a life of somebody else on my conscience. There are different types of people. I'm just sp eaking for myself. And I cannot, and I'm not sorry that I did not know, that I did not do. The next thing what happened in Buchenwald after the liberation, the young army soldiers grabbed few of us who were near, and they immediately, after the marching they took the commandant, previous commandant from the camp, the Germans, with the guards, and put them there closed in the bunk. They came to us and said, come with us, we show you something. They took us to the bunker there and showed us SS lying there on the floor and said, \ufb01you want a gun, you want a Interview with Henry Kolber 35 stick, do whatever you want.\ufb02 Yeah, very true, there were many of my inmates there who took their advantage, but I felt, and that bothers me today, some times, did I act the right I couldn't make myself to happ en. Because I felt if I would do this to him, I would lower myself to this position of what he did to me. So I don't know. And sometimes I'm ashamed to tell this, that I was a coward."
