They were ju st a wonderful congenial gamily. My mother came from a quite a big family. Eight or nine brot hers and sisters. Her father had died at a very early age. He was in the diamond industry, a nd my grandmother lived for a long time died, I think in 1936 or 37. I knew my grandmother. My mother came from a very close-knit family. All the sisters came together almost, like I said, every Thursday night and from that family only three survived in hiding. A niece, interesting enough, other people were not orthodox people. From that family, the three people were not or thodox at all. One went with the Palestine transport to Palestine and they lost their only so n and one other sister who went into hiding lost their only son and one sister and brother-in-law survived in hi ding with their two children who are now living in Australia and the United States. She worked very hard. She made sure that we got a good upbringing, but in the meantime they were both working, they had to make a living and still I never had any idea of poverty. I knew there was no money, but I still never had no idea that we were poor at all. Although we were poor. As su ch we had a wonderful life."

            "answer": "My sister Julia was a. I woul d say, a woman with problems. I hate to say that. Basically she always had emotional problems from early date o n. She was in a way, she was beautiful. She was smart as all our kids and sometimes being smart doesn\u2122t make it easiest in life, and she suffered. I think somewhere by the fact that my fa ther favored my younger si ster at a later date. She was crazy about a young man who she met in the Zionist Movement, and they were engaged and they got married, and they shouldn\u2122t have gotten married beca use he was as nice and smart a man as he was, he was certainly no t the right man for her and she never recognized that. They fortunately I would say, had no child ren. They were on the forefront of the Zionist Movement in Holland. Both he and she were good speakers. They taught Hebrew. Her Hebrew was much better than mine. They were planning to go to Palestine. I don\u2122t recall exactly how and where, but there is a book just out now about all the people who were in the Hav Shara movement in Holland and her name is mentioned in that book, which made me sure that she was really in the Hav Shara Movement before the war. She got married, I think, in 1938, and stayed in Amsterdam until July \u212243. They were se nt in the same transport as I to Westerbork. They also were put on the Palestine list. With th e Palestine list they came to Bergen Belsen. Of course being young they were not allowed to go with the Palestine transport."

She deteriorated fast, she looked terrible when I last saw her, which was, as I recall, only the beginning of April 1945 in Bergen Belsen. We didn\u2122t see each other too mu ch because I worked in the kitchen. I do not know anything more than that they both went with the same train in those cattle cars in April 11, 1945 leaving Bergen Belsen and going to Germany. She was liberated together with me in Trovitz, near Leipzig and must ha ve died two days after liberation. I learned that only, I would say, one week after I came out of a coma, they didn\u2122t tell me right away, and in fact I do recall that about one week after I came out of the coma they told me that Roosevelt had died and that my sister had died. Q Can we go back maybe to, do you know, did she have any interests as a child? Did she play any instruments? Did you have any pets in the family? ",
                " We never had. Yes, we must have had cats so mewhere. I remember something about cats. But, basically we were never pet lovers, so I don\u2122t recall at all that we had pets. We all played an instrument. One of the things I do recall is notwithstanding the fact that we were poor, my parents always teach us piano or violin, whatever it was. I had two years of piano lessons which was a complete waste. But, I do recall because somebody in a good family had to learn some instrument. I don\u2122t remember what my sisters learned, but I\u2122m sure they did too. "

I really was more personally I was more geared to the non-Jewish friends I could get. Maybe at that time alrea dy I felt more I was a member of the basketball club, which had about twenty percent Jews. Or eighty percent non-Jews then. Not that it was ever mentioned to us or stated that it was twenty and eighty percent. Now I recall at a later date really, you know, I don\u2122t think she went out to the non-Jewish world as much as I did. Of course having worked at the Carlton Hotel in Amsterdam, it made me al so better understand the importance of the non-Jewish world to the Jewish people. But she circled really around the life of completely Zionist life. That was ninety percent of her life."

I never gave it to her. Now, if the psychiatrist would examine me he would say you have tr emendous guilt thinking about it, and would have the rest of your life. I must say in all honesty I felt at that moment that piece of bread could save my life and I didn\u2122t give it to my sister. But I still thi nk about it. It wouldn\u2122t have saved her life anyway, but things like that , you know, stay for a long time. That was about the last time I saw her. One of the horrors of life."
