He took me most of the tim e to shul, I remember, and holidays no question about it. On a Saturday most of the business people were Jews in the city. Very few gentiles had businesses, some had but the majority was Jewish. Come Saturday, the stores were closed up. It may be singles, Jewish stores, they were open like candy stores, or a drugstore or something like that. The rest was shut up completely. Some were open Sundays; they allowed some stores to be opened Sundays, holidays and Saturdays everybody closed. Even the people that only went to the synagogue on Yom Ki ppur and Rosh Hashanah, they still observed the holidays. ",

It was a city of nine to ten thousand Jews and nobody tried to escape, actually nobody. Some Polish people did, officers evacuated some families and police, almost to the last day, the police, the firemen, they stayed will the last day. Almost the last day, they evacuated. What happened between those two weeks, it took about two weeks till the 17th of September; it was a Sunday morning a nd Germany was successful in occupying already quite a bit of -- most of -- about two-thirds of Poland. I think the only place that still was not occupied was Wa rsaw. They lasted almost a month. Somebody, I guess rumors started to fly or somebody knew already, they said within a few hours the Russian army is going to be here. It didn\u2122t take long, an hour or two and we heard shelling or something. They were going, the Russian army was advancing and just shooting so that the people don\u2122t attack them. They didn\u2122t know who the Polish army is still th ere or the police, they had no idea. They were just like shelling like over the cities to announce that they are here. Whoever didn\u2122t escape yet from the governme nt tried to get out. But there was no fighting, there was no damage. It was very festive when they actually showed up. Their tanks and the artillery, the cavalry; actually the whole town went out to greet them in the streets, special there was a lot of -- not only Jewish people but some Poles too that they were socialists or communists or whatever. There was no communist Party, it was illegal but there were people that believe in socialism and they were the first ones to greet the soldiers and run the city right from the beginning."

They came back, they let out the prisons from there. They came back to the city, one of them became a mayor. He rode a horse and became a mayor. They figured he was a man that was way back, a card member, he sat in jail. So they gave him the honor of being a mayor but not for long, a w eek or two, then they appointed their own; they brought in their own people to manage the city. A little bit later, they brought their families and they took over the buildings where the Polish officers used to live with their families which was evacuated already and they settled there.

The officers, the big and even the private people that were brought in, a big majority were Jewish people from Russia. It was a very positive th ing for the Jewish people. It was very positive for the Ukrainian but it was not so positive for the Poles. Poles were looked a little bit down because the Russian s said that they came to liberate us from the Polish yoke or whatever. So th e Poles had a difficulty of getting a good position. Also then a couple of months la ter, they established everybody from 16 years and a half had to get a passport, the Russian passports with pictures. We had to go to register. People went to register according to their professions, whatever they did. If anybody owned a business before, they marked on the passport that this man is a businessman or if he had a son over 16, the son would be marked son of a businessman. W ith that passport you couldn\u2122t land a good position already because you were consider ed a capitalist. That\u2122s how they marked the passports. Also you had to put your nationality, Jew, Pole or Ukrainian They had in their passports what it was, even till today. All my friends that their parents were in business and th ey had problems getting jobs. Being that my father was not marked as a businessman on his passport, he was, through him I was able to get in a few of my friends to that concern too."

At that time already, Germany took two-thir ds of Poland and they took one-third. They divided between themselves. But at that time already there was a little friction between both of them somehow. There were not such good relations and yet they were shipping all the grains out to them. I remember asking that question to one of the officers that was giving the lecture. They had special propaganda men that worked in uniform and they were lecturers, special lectures. I asked him, how could we ship to them the grains that being they\u2122re already trying to tell us that they\u2122re not friends, they\u2122re like enemies.

At that time when the war broke out, they didn\u2122t mobilize a ny more except whoever was still around who was not sent away to the points where they train you, they would send them right away.

But then they broke through the lines and it was disaster. The first week we were still going into the office and then some of the Russian directors were evacuating their families already, mobilizing some cars or trucks if they ha d. In our concern too, the director was taking trucks and horse and buggies, pu tting furniture and stuff and sending family back to Russia. We were just standing there. The Jewish people started thinking about the evacuation because whoever was in the police, or whoever was communist or something, they didn\u2122t want to take chances. I think the second week already, it was like _______ they were running. Soldiers were coming back from the fronts in trucks full with soldiers . People tried to get rides with them; some did, some couldn\u2122t succeed. Again my family wouldn\u2122t think of running; not only mine, the majority didn\u2122t think of anything.

They brought them up to a Polish border station and left them there. Then different communities tried to absorb some of them even though it was in the west part of Poland, some wound up by us. Most of them had some family or some relations, they came here but some didn\u2122t. Some were trying to actually work their way to get into Russia. They figure they go to the eastern part of Poland, maybe they\u2122ll be able to get across the border to Russia. We had quite a few refugees here. Again, that was the worst thing that happened to them. They threw them out of Germany."

Nobody put their head out. As a matter of fact, wherever we lived at the time, there was a lot of gentile people lived there in that section. In that cellar, there was mostly gentile people there. But nobody would stick their head out. I had a chance to go there --= I\u2122ll just make it short. The fellow that I acqua inted at the airfield, the second week of the evacuation, a tank pulls up in front of our house. Everybody got scared in the neighborhood, a tank, what\u2122s a tank doing here? A Russian tank pulled up. A guy comes out and goes up to our house. Th at\u2122s the fellow, he came with a tank. He came to take me with us. He says we are evacuating, the Germans are going to be here any day and come with me, I\u2122ll take you back to Russia. You might be in trouble here, you know, the Jewish people won\u2122t have it so good. There was a discussion between my father and my moth er, should they go, should they not go. I was like, I had nothing to say probably but I didn\u2122t want to go. I know I didn\u2122t want to go. I wasn\u2122t ready yet to be on my own. They decided not to let me go, my mother especially, they don\u2122t want to let me go. He left and also at the same time, maybe a day different, quite a few youngsters a little bit older than me, maybe a year or two older from the nei ghborhood, walked out from their homes. Said goodbyes and they all wear these knapsacks on them and they said whoever wants to join them, they\u2122re going. They\u2122re going to try to reach Russia.

Two Ukrainian policemen were there; there we re no Ukrainian police before, all of a sudden, there\u2122s Ukrainian police, uniforms and rifles. We didn\u2122t know at the time but that day also they proclaimed indepe ndent Ukraine with the capitol in Lvov. The Germans let them have an independent Ukraine.

They had plenty, there were sections where there were a lot of Jews and why they came here, they had to cross a bridge --. The minute they knocked on the door, me and my sister, we were hiding under the bed or somewheres in the bedroom and they took my father. My mother was crying and of course we thought he\u2122ll never come back. He didn\u2122t show up till late in the evening, he came back which it was like a miracle too. He says they did take him to work something by the river, whatever he had to do. Him and w hoever else they caught. He says they didn\u2122t beat him and when they finished wh atever they were doing; they let him go. It was the first experience. Second experience with the Germans, the next day already..

Now I don\u2122t remember if it was the second day or the third day, a lot of German cars, motorcycles pulled up in our street. They stopped on the street and some of them came into the -- we had like a yard in the front and they put in their motorcycles in the yard. They were knocking on the doors; evidently they were shown where Jews lived. They were not youngsters, they were officers, elderly guys and they were from the army. Evid ently they were asking where Jews are living not because -- we didn\u2122t know, the mi nute we saw these things we tried to run down the basement over there by that time. But my mother stayed out and what they were looking for, they were looking for Jewish people in order to communicate. Because they couldn\u2122t communicate with the other people and most of the Jews knew German someho w because the Yiddish and German is very similar. They stopped for a rest and they had all kinds of provisions with them and they want us to cook.

There was no kind of register, you would not receive rations. They didn\u2122t say you would be punished or something just have to register. The same thing, the gentile population had an announcement. They have to register in their places wherever so most of the people went to register . When you registered, I didn\u2122t go, my father went and he registered. They asked him his profession from before and address and everything and he registered. Then I think a week or two later you had to go and pick up the rations. It was very small rations that they gave you. Whatever they gave, the Jews got half of it. Then every day different posters. If anyone has a radio, he has to turn it in. Anybody has a telephone, he has to turn it in. You cannot walk on the sidewalk, any Jew cannot walk on the sidewalk. Every Jew must have an armband with th e Star of David, a white armband with a blue Star of David. It has to be so many centimeters, ten or whatever and it has to be worn on the left arm. Again, different -- no Jew can have a business. If he has a business, he has to take in a gentile partner but at that time already the Russians took the businesses away and there wasn\u2122t that many. They still had businesses, there were some their stores were nationa lized so they were talking about these stores; where the people worked for the Russians but it was their own from before.

When we registered for the food rations, the Jewish community building had a list of everybody. There were some people they didn\u2122t register. The only people they did not register were the ones, we found out later, they couldn\u2122t make it to Russia. They came back and they were members of Communist Youth or somewhere. One guy was a policeman for the Russians so they didn\u2122t want to be exposed at all. They were in hiding like and they didn\u2122t register. Because they didn\u2122t want anybody to know that they are here because otherwise the German, the first thing they would call to them. They were part of the Russian establishment. So with those names and addresses and the lists of the professions, what happened in October, I think one day it was in October, we woke up in the morning and we found out that during the night, the Germans came and took away 150 people. I think it was in August, I\u2122m not sure. In the book I have it exactly, it might have been August. I think it was in August; they came one night and they took out 150 ______ from different addresses, 150 people, doctors, lawyers, accountants. They told the families they taking them to work and the next day the peasants told us they took them to a forest outside the city and they were shot. This took away the leadership, the intelligentsia; it was th e people that they could be a potential leadership or something, that knocked out 99%. They left a few single doctors, surgeons, they left a few. Like lawyers, it was only the vice-mayor that he was the chief of the -- they called it Judenrat at that time. I don\u2122t think there was any other lawyers left that I recall. With one shot they knocked out the cream of the population. They organized in October, they organized a certain amount of people to go from the city to a labo r camp, somewhere 80 kilometers away or whatever. We didn\u2122t know at that time where. Of course, they came and brought -- no, they got our name too. We had a notic e that I had to report next day to the Judenrat to go to that camp. Again, you know, was in the house between my mother and father. My mother didn\u2122t want me to let me go; my father said well I\u2122ll have to go. In the meantime they ar e preparing a knapsack for me with food and clothing whatever. They didn\u2122t know for how long; I think they said for three months. Then you\u2122ll come back and other people will take your place. The decision was finally that no, I should not go. That\u2122s when I went to that Ukrainian\u2122s house where I stayed two or three nights. It was my mother\u2122s idea. My father was -- he didn\u2122t, he couldn\u2122t decide one way or the other. It was just a plain labor camp, they didn\u2122t shoot people there but a lot of youngsters died there; a lot of men died because it was very hard labor, very hard. The work they were doing had nothing to do with labor. They were moving tremendous sizes blocks or stones or whatever from one place to another, up a mountain, down a mountain. It was in the winter, people came back frozen. They were lucky they came back frozen because they were bought from the families. They went and paid up some money to the Judenrat and they were able to send a certain amount back. Then the Judenrat sent other people there, mobilized other people. They didn\u2122t want to go, they came to the house, it was Jewish police already, and they took them. There was no question, th ere was no place where to run. These people they came back, one of my friends came back and he had one of his toes frozen up completely, more than one."

If they wouldn\u2122t be out, they would be shot. Everything was under the threat of being shot. The same thing to the gentil es. If they lived in the parts where there\u2122s going to be the ghetto on those streets and if they\u2122re found there after the 1 st, they would be shot. The majority of movement was from the outskirts in, not from the ghetto out becau se very few gentiles lived in the middle of the town; the majority was Jewish. Bu t some of them did leave there to go out, find a place or whatever."

            "answer": "No, actually they had two ghettos. Our ghetto was on the small part, it was a very small section of the ghetto. It was maybe, maybe a fourth of the size of the main ghetto. What I say main ghetto is, there we re separated by one of the main streets of the city. That side was separated and there was a main street running through the town from one end to the other, to the railroad station. The majority was on the right side of that thing and we were on the left side. Of course, we could not go from one to the other except during the day, certain hours. We were not allowed to be from six o\u2122clock on or fi ve, I think from six o\u2122clock on, we were not allowed to be on the street at all. It was a curfew like for the Jewish people, you could not be on the street. If they caught you on the street you could be shot. In order to cross from one ghetto to th e other, also you expose yourself because there was the main street. There could be German traffic, it could be Ukrainian police traffic and very seldom did I vent ure from here to there except on a Sunday. On a Sunday, the Germans did thei r thing home and it was like a -- there was no business going on like that. I ventured on a Sunday to the main ghetto and I had a lot of friends there and on the streets and so on."

People had to trade whatever they had, their belongings; would go to the edge of the ghetto and trade with the gentiles and all that. They woul d come to the fence and barter this for that but most of the people still had something. But then after April 1st, they started to bring into the ghetto, people from surrounding communities, from little villages, not little villages where the Jews were killed already, from little towns. They didn\u2122t want little ghettos in each to wn. Their plan was to concentrate in biggest cities so they can get to them better. They brought in more people and that made it worse. Not only just with food, there\u2122s no place where to stay. People slept in hallways; it was a pity for those people that they came from outside. We were in already there with people, more or less established. But it didn\u2122t last that long. It lasted till August and they liquidated, they made actions, they started actions."

If th ey would have taken maybe some people would have remained, people that could have lasted or were strong enough to survive. But they did not take to any concentration camps. They killed them right there on the spot and they had special woods, on the airf ield where the airfield was built, they made mass graves there, you know."

We knew it\u2122s a matter of days, we were in th e open all the time. I was in the open most of the time, on a farm. We tried to find a place to hide between when the fronts are going to go through. We were di scovered in one place; we didn\u2122t want to be there. We dug a place where we thought nobody would be looking; then went in there.

It was dangerous for them to be there because again, the place where I was on that farm in the village, it was the center of the Ukrainian nationalists. They were fighting the Russians and the Germans because the independent Ukraine lasted only three months. After that, the Germans annulled it. They were alre ady against the Germans and special for the Russians, they were against the Russians. It\u2122s a story, the liberation itself. It\u2122s a separate chapter."

We had like I say about ten thousand Jewish people in this city before and there was about 50 or 60 survived from the German occupation. Some survived that they went to Russia; they managed to get there. Some survived, maybe 150 or so. But the few that survived, we didn\u2122t want to be there because everything was against us. I managed to get a job back in the same concern; the Russians came back, the concern opened up and I met somebody that worked from before, just one person.
