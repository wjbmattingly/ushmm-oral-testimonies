He was reared in a contemporary religious family, and attended\nPolish public school and a Jewish school. He graduated from business school at 16 just\nbefore war broke out in 1939. That year, the Russians took over his town, which\nprotected them for a short time.\nAfter the Germans invaded Poland, they shot about 99 percent, some 150 of Lublin\u2019s\nbest- educated, professional Jews.\nAbe asserts that no Jews in Lublin tried to escape. Lublin\u2019s two ghettos were established\non April 1, 1942, and the Morgensterns were moved into one of them that month. Food\nbecame very scarce.\nAbe\u2019 father and sister perished during the first of four actions. Abe says that no Jews\nfrom his area were taken to concentration camps; they were shot in the woods and put\ninto mass graves.\nAbe does not provide many details about how he and his mother survived, except to say\nthat she bribed some people. He refers the interviewer to an unnamed book he wrote.\nAbe mentions labor camps, one in Kamionka. One was burned down, killing the camp\ninmates. Abe reported a few times to the Judenrat, which took him to work temporarily at\na factory and then at a camp. But eventually, he says, \u201cI just stayed home.\u201d\nToward the end of the war, Abe and eight others dug a hole where they hid until Russian\ntroops found them; about two weeks after the Russians had liberated the area.\nAfter the war, he and his mother immigrated to Italy. They had planned to go to Palestine\nwhere they had relatives, but did not go because they did not know the relatives\u2019 names\nor addresses.\nAbe says that of Lublin\u2019s estimated 10,000 Jews, only about 200 survived -- 50 or 60 in\nthe city, and about 150 who had escaped to Russia.\nInterview with Abraham Morgenstern Transcript\nA: The minute they came to that city going to Poland already in 1921, I think that\u2019s\nwhere they smuggled the border from Russia to Poland and my father met quite a\nfew people that he knew from before that already came ahead of him to that city,\nThis is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.\nhttp://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nand he found some cousins and whatever. He also, I guess, was offered a\nposition, a good position. He managed a flourmill, and my mother got pregnant\nand so there was an excuse not to go. Then when I came already, my father didn\u2019t\nfeel like leaving. He was a little established already and he felt good there. He had\na lot of people that he knew and it was a nice town, a religious town and that\u2019s\nhow we stuck there.\n",

Some were modern, some were old-time religious but my father had no beard and he was --. In that mill, as I say, later when I was growing up, he was traveling to villages and little towns buying grains from the peasants. Then he was giving them to the casino and that\u2019s how he made his living at that time. I went to public school and in the afternoon I went to cheder which was a Jewish school. Then later on when I was like 11, 12, 13, I went to Hebrew School in the afternoon for two, three years. We learned other subjects too beside Hebrew."

There were two higher schools after that. One was the gymnasium they called it which was run by the state, and the other one was business school. It was also -- it wasn\u2019t run by the state, it was private but they were on the same level. You had to wear uniforms and you had to get exams before being admitted. I went three years there and I graduated in 1939. There, besides all the other subjects, you learned -- they also taught me German. I took German language. You could take French or German. I choose German so I\u2019m familiar with the German language too."

In the cheder, what we went when I was small yet, I could speak to the teacher in Yiddish that time but we never spoke --.

He took me most of the time to shul, I remember, and holidays no question about it. On a Saturday most of the business people were Jews in the city. Very few gentiles had businesses, some had but the majority was Jewish. Come Saturday, the stores were closed up. It may be singles, Jewish stores, they were open like candy stores, or a drugstore or something like that. The rest was shut up completely. Some were open Sundays; they allowed some stores to be opened Sundays, holidays and Saturdays everybody closed. Even the people that only went to the synagogue on Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah, they still observed the holidays."

He used to keep it at somebody\u2019s stable but when he went out of town he used to go with -- he used to rent a drive of it with a horse and carriage that you could bring the grain back on that. It was like a commercial type horse and buggy, not a pleasure. As far as taking me, he\u2019d take me -- most of the time he would take me -- he went to a place where we had some kind of relations, distant, whatever, my father knew. He would leave me there for the day, with his business and I would be there with other youngsters for me. Distant, distant relatives or acquaintances whatever. As far as working, I did not work but upon the graduation of the business school in 1939, my father took me to that flourmill where he used to manage before Even though he was out already, maybe ten years out of that place, no not ten years, maybe seven or so, he took me to the office there. He knew the people, the accountants in the office and the managers and they interviewed me and they gave me a test and they hired me as of the first of September. I had a position in the bookkeeper\u2019s office there. I was very happy, I didn\u2019t have to -- in other words I got it through my father. I didn\u2019t get it on my own because I was green at that time, 16 years."

The people that they sold the mill, the owners came from Lvov, you\u2019re familiar with this city, probably you\u2019 ve read about it, it was a big city in the Ukraine. So the new owners came and I don\u2019t know whether they let him go or it was -- I don\u2019t know the details, I never asked. But since then he didn\u2019t work there but he was very friendly with the people, even with the new owners. The people, they sold the mill, opened up a new one at the other end of the town, somehow. They built a new one or they built and then they sold it, whatever it was, I don\u2019t know. He knew the people there and that\u2019s how he got me the job.

It was the German propaganda and Hitler\u2019s speeches, you know, was broadcast all over. They demanded Danzig, it\u2019s a port city there. They gave in to this and he demanded something else after that. They knew that they cannot get out of it, he\u2019s going to attack sooner or later. The minute that they declared the mobilization, it was a Friday night or something, the next day or so they declared war. Germany declared, they attacked first and then they declared."

There was a general mobilization and all doctors, dentists were mobilized and put into uniform right away and sent to different parts of Poland. They did it quick but our city was not -- was at the other end -- was at the eastern end of Poland. So it was not attacked, was not attacked by the Germans, they concentrated a little bit the other way, the western part, that\u2019s where they attacked from, the western part. It dragged on like this for about two weeks. People started to evacuate from Warsaw and Lodz (?) and different cities. We used to see a lot of cars coming through with people in it. On top of the Romanian border. We were very close to the Romanian and Russian border, was like 30 kilometers or something to the Romanian border, or 35, just nothing. They all had cars, most of them with cars, people, not only Polish people, Jewish people too, they had means and they didn\u2019t want to be caught. They figured they\u2019ll go to Romania and Romania was independent and from there they would -. Actually, they did and people that went to Romania, they wound up in England. All the Polish escapees wound up in England."

It was a city of nine to ten thousand Jews and nobody tried to escape, actually nobody. Some Polish people did, officers evacuated some families and police, almost to the last day, the police, the firemen, they stayed will the last day. Almost the last day, they evacuated. What happened between those two weeks, it took about two weeks till the 17\" of September; it was a Sunday morning and Germany was successful in occupying already quite a bit of -- most of -- about two-thirds of Poland. I think the only place that still was not occupied was Warsaw. They lasted almost a month. Somebody, I guess rumors started to fly or somebody knew already, they said within a few hours the Russian army is going to be here. It didn\u2019t take long, an hour or two and we heard shelling or something. They were going, the Russian army was advancing and just shooting so that the people don\u2019t attack them. They didn\u2019t know who the Polish army is still there or the police, they had no idea. They were just like shelling like over the cities to announce that they are here. Whoever didn\u2019t escape yet from the government tried to get out. But there was no fighting, there was no damage. It was very festive when they actually showed up. Their tanks and the artillery, the cavalry; actually the whole town went out to greet them in the streets, special there was a lot of -- not only Jewish people but some Poles too that they were socialists or communists or whatever. There was no communist Party, it was illegal but there were people that believe in socialism and they were the first ones to greet the soldiers and run the city right from the beginning."

The mayor became one of the -- our own people sitting in jail in the other part of Poland, in the north somewhere belonging to the communist party. They came back, they let out the prisons from there. They came back to the city, one of them became a mayor. He rode a horse and became a mayor. They figured he was a man that was way back, a card member, he sat in jail. So they gave him the honor of being a mayor but not for long, a week or two, then they appointed their own; they brought in their own people to manage the city. A little bit later, they brought their families and they took over the buildings where the Polish officers used to live with their families which was evacuated already and they settled there. Later on they even took over Jewish apartments and they settled the Russians and things like that. They nationalized the buildings and everything."

            "answer": "Yes, very positive because they treated the Jews very nicely. You know the Russian authorities at that time, most of the occupiers. The officers, the big and even the private people that were brought in, a big majority were Jewish people from Russia. It was a very positive thing for the Jewish people. It was very positive for the Ukrainian but it was not so positive for the Poles. Poles were looked a little bit down because the Russians said that they came to liberate us from the Polish yoke or whatever. So the Poles had a difficulty of getting a good position. Also then a couple of months later, they established everybody from 16 years and a half had to get a passport, the Russian passports with pictures. We had to go to register. People went to register according to their professions, whatever they did. If anybody owned a business before, they marked on the passport that this man is a businessman or if he had a son over 16, the son would be marked son of a businessman. With that passport you couldn\u2019t land a good position already because you were considered a capitalist. That\u2019s how they marked the passports. Also you had to put your nationality, Jew, Pole or Ukrainian They had in their passports what it was, even till today. All my friends that their parents were in business and they had problems getting jobs. Being that my father was not marked as a businessman on his passport, he was, through him I was able to get in a few of my friends to that concern too."

As a matter of fact, they have it in the book. One of the lectures that I remember, we worked in the grain concern. Most of the grains were being shipped to Germany. At that time already, Germany took two-thirds of Poland and they took one-third. They divided between themselves. But at that time already there was a little friction between both of them somehow. There were not such good relations and yet they were shipping all the grains out to them. I remember asking that question to one of the officers that was giving the lecture. They had special propaganda men that worked in uniform and they were lecturers, special lectures. I asked him, how could we ship to them the grains that being they\u2019re already trying to tell us that they\u2019re not friends, they\u2019re like enemies. They\u2019re trying to build up their thing against us or whatever. He says, no we have to buy time and the amounts that we give them are negligible but from our concern most of them went there. He says we have to buy time to be prepared. They were preparing the building airfield outside the city."

Before it was like a public; they opened up a separate Jewish gymnasium with Jewish language, Hebrew, Jewish and most of the Jewish kids that want to go to a gymnasium would go into that gymnasium.

They had special places where they sent people that worked nice in the offices, they worked good and they deserved a little break, they would send them paid vacations to a place where it\u2019s like a resort area. I was scheduled to go on my two weeks to that resort area. Here like a week before it, a week before my vacation, I was called into the office of the director and he said, he says, I know that you must realize that how we are trying up an army and we have to get prepared because the Germans keep saying they\u2019re going to attack us and they built up a very big might against us. Everybody has to sacrifice and being I\u2019m a good citizen or whatever, each office has to concentrate to the building of the airfield.

They interviewed me and they said okay, whatever that day was. Next Monday you\u2019re starting, have to be there six o\u2019clock in the morning. It was, I don\u2019t remember how I got there the first day, I really don\u2019t remember. My father had somebody drive me most of the time. I know I walked one time. I walked. They took me up there and they had mobilized all the peasants from the vicinity, all around from that area, mobilized under duress. Otherwise they didn\u2019t get even paid. Whoever had a horse and buggy was mobilized and they had to transport all kinds of materials from the warehouses and back to that place where they\u2019re building the airport. They had engineers, they had a lot of Russians and they were walking on the ground and it was just a big, big field, a tremendous field. From scratch they had to stop and build that airport. I was there two weeks and I think the second or the third day, I got acquainted with a Russian fellow that he was in the Russian army but he was in civilian clothes. He was something, a demolition expert or whatever and he was working underground something. He had a truck, he was driving a truck, they run the little trucks or something We got acquainted and he says; I said I would like -. I walked home, that\u2019s what it was, the first day I walked home. Quite a bit to walk, an hour and a half or whatever I don\u2019t remember, an hour or more. He said- | invited him. If you want to come to the house, you can have supper with us, figured he\u2019ll give me a ride which he did. I says you come to the house and you can even stay there overnight. In the morning you'll come back."

Close to nine o\u2019clock usually my friends would show up already and nobody\u2019s there. Here and there, there\u2019s somebody there, you know. Go for a swim by yourself, how much can you be in the water by yourself. I go out just waiting for people to show up so we usually play cards. Then somebody around ten o\u2019clock, somebody shows up. He says what are you people doing here? Don\u2019t you know there\u2019s a war? That\u2019s how I found out. Actually they bombed already cities at four o\u2019clock in the morning. Four o\u2019clock in the morning, Kiev was bombed, Lvov, other cities, Vilna, quite a few cities were bombed. Our city was bombed too but a little bit later, they bombed our city. That\u2019s how I found out."

Whoever was born in 1922, was 19 years old, they were mobilized like in March and April already, they went to be inducted. At that time when the war broke out, they didn\u2019t mobilize any more except whoever was still around who was not sent away to the points where they train you, they would send them right away. Again it was two weeks till the Germans came and they started to evacuate. The first week was normal. They attacked but they were holding their ground for the first four or five days or something. But then they broke through the lines and it was disaster. The first week we were still going into the office and then some of the Russian directors were evacuating their families already, mobilizing some cars or trucks if they had. In our concern too, the director was taking trucks and horse and buggies, putting furniture and stuff and sending family back to Russia. We were just standing there. The Jewish people started thinking about the evacuation because whoever was in the police, or whoever was communist or something, they didn\u2019t want to take chances. I think the second week already, it was like they were running. Soldiers were coming back from the fronts in trucks full with soldiers. People tried to get rides with them; some did, some couldn\u2019t succeed. Again my family wouldn\u2019t think of running; not only mine, the majority didn\u2019t think of anything. Even though we knew that the Germans, they\u2019re against the Jews but nobody thought of something happening whatever happened."

There was no concentration camps, there was no -- at that time there was no extermination, nobody even thought about it in 1941.

They brought them up to a Polish border station and left them there. Then different communities tried to absorb some of them even though it was in the west part of Poland, some wound up by us. Most of them had some family or some relations, they came here but some didn\u2019t. Some were trying to actually work their way to get into Russia. They figure they go to the eastern part of Poland, maybe they\u2019ll be able to get across the border to Russia. We had quite a few refugees here.

But nobody would stick their head out. I had a chance to go there --= [Il just make it short. The fellow that I acquainted at the airfield, the second week of the evacuation, a tank pulls up in front of our house.

He came to take me with us. He says we are evacuating, the Germans are going to be here any day and come with me, I'll take you back to Russia. You might be in trouble here, you know, the Jewish people won\u2019t have it so good. There was a discussion between my father and my mother, should they go, should they not go. I was like, I had nothing to say probably but I didn\u2019t want to go. I know I didn\u2019t want to go. I wasn\u2019t ready yet to be on my own. They decided not to let me go, my mother especially, they don\u2019t want to let me go. He left and also at the same time, maybe a day different, quite a few youngsters a little bit older than me, maybe a year or two older from the neighborhood, walked out from their homes. Said goodbyes and they all wear these knapsacks on them and they said whoever wants to join them, they\u2019re going. They\u2019re going to try to reach Russia. They went out, on the outskirts and that\u2019s all we saw of them. But about two or three days later, they came back. They came back, they couldn\u2019t get rides with nobody and they couldn\u2019t go by foot. They all came back. Then this fellow came with the tank, he didn\u2019t go to Russia either."

They\u2019re catching Jews or whatever. Of course we didn\u2019t. A little bit later, there was a knock on the door, the same day, and it was in the afternoon, early in the afternoon. Two Ukrainian policemen were there; there were no Ukrainian police before, all of a sudden, there\u2019s Ukrainian police, uniforms and rifles. We didn\u2019t know at the time but that day also they proclaimed independent Ukraine with the capitol in Lvov. The Germans let them have an independent Ukraine.

They had plenty, there were sections where there were a lot of Jews and why they came here, they had to cross a bridge --. The minute they knocked on the door, me and my sister, we were hiding under the bed or somewheres in the bedroom and they took my father. My mother was crying and of course we thought he\u2019 Il never come back. He didn\u2019t show up till late in the evening, he came back which it was like a miracle too. He says they did take him to work something by the river, whatever he had to do. Him and whoever else they caught. He says they didn\u2019t beat him and when they finished whatever they were doing; they let him go. It was the first experience. Second experience with the Germans, the next day already.. We didn\u2019t go any more in the basement because there was no more shelling already so we stayed in the room. We still didn\u2019t dare to go in the street. Now I don\u2019t remember if it was the second day or the third day, a lot of German cars, motorcycles pulled up in our street. They stopped on the street and some of them came into the -- we had like a yard in the front and they put in their motorcycles in the yard. They were knocking on the doors; evidently they were shown where Jews lived. They were not youngsters, they were officers, elderly guys and they were from the army. Evidently they were asking where Jews are living not because -- we didn\u2019t know, the minute we saw these things we tried to run down the basement over there by that time. But my mother stayed out and what they were looking for, they were looking for Jewish people in order to communicate. Because they couldn\u2019t communicate with the other people and most of the Jews knew German somehow because the Yiddish and German is very similar. They stopped for a rest and they had all kinds of provisions with them and they want us to cook. They want the women to cook for them the stuff and they should have their break and eat and then they go further. That\u2019s what happened."

Every street had different places where they announced what\u2019s going on and that the Jewish people have to register at the community center in order to receive food stamps, rations, food rations; otherwise you have to be registered. There was no kind of register, you would not receive rations. They didn\u2019t say you would be punished or something just have to register. The same thing, the gentile population had an announcement. They have to register in their places wherever so most of the people went to register. When you registered, I didn\u2019t go, my father went and he registered. They asked him his profession from before and address and everything and he registered. Then I think a week or two later you had to go and pick up the rations. It was very small rations that they gave you. Whatever they gave, the Jews got half of it. Then every day different posters. If anyone has a radio, he has to turn it in. Anybody has a telephone, he has to turn it in. You cannot walk on the sidewalk, any Jew cannot walk on the sidewalk. Every Jew must have an armband with the Star of David, a white armband with a blue Star of David. It has to be so many centimeters, ten or whatever and it has to be worn on the left arm. Again, different -- no Jew can have a business. If he has a business, he has to take in a gentile partner but at that time already the Russians took the businesses away and there wasn\u2019t that many. They still had businesses, there were some their stores were nationalized so they were talking about these stores; where the people worked for the Russians but it was their own from before. They had to take in a partner, an Ukrainian partner -- was only the beginning. Then the Ukrainian took it right over."

When we registered for the food rations, the Jewish community building had a list of everybody. There were some people they didn\u2019t register. The only people they did not register were the ones, we found out later, they couldn\u2019t make it to Russia. They came back and they were members of Communist Youth or somewhere. One guy was a policeman for the Russians so they didn\u2019t want to be exposed at all. They were in hiding like and they didn\u2019t register. Because they didn\u2019t want anybody to know that they are here because otherwise the German, the first thing they would call to them. They were part of the Russian establishment. So with those names and addresses and the lists of the professions, what happened in October, I think one day it was in October, we woke up in the morning and we found out that during the night, the Germans came and took away 150 people. I think it was in August, I\u2019m not sure. In the book I have it exactly, it might have been August. I think it was in August; they came one night and they took out 150 from different addresses, 150 people, doctors, lawyers, accountants. They told the families they taking them to work and the next day the peasants told us they took them to a forest outside the city and they were shot. This took away the leadership, the intelligentsia; it was the people that they could be a potential leadership or something, that knocked out 99%. They left a few single doctors, surgeons, they left a few. Like lawyers, 1t was only the vice-mayor that he was the chief of the -- they called it Judenrat at that time. I don\u2019t think there was any other lawyers left that I recall. With one shot they knocked out the cream of the population. They organized in October, they organized a certain amount of people to go from the city to a labor camp, somewhere 80 kilometers away or whatever. We didn\u2019t know at that time where. Of course, they came and brought- no, they got our name too. We had a notice that I had to report next day to the Judenrat to go to that camp. Again, you know, was in the house between my mother and father. My mother didn\u2019t want me to let me go; my father said well Pll have to go. In the meantime they are preparing a knapsack for me with food and clothing whatever. They didn\u2019t know for how long; I think they said for three months. Then you\u2019ll come back and other people will take your place. The decision was finally that no, I should not go. That\u2019s when I went to that Ukrainian\u2019s house where I stayed two or three nights. It was my mother\u2019s idea. My father was -- he didn\u2019t, he couldn\u2019t decide one way or the other. It was just a plain labor camp, they didn\u2019t shoot people there but a lot of youngsters died there; a lot of men died because it was very hard labor, very hard. The work they were doing had nothing to do with labor. They were moving tremendous sizes blocks or stones or whatever from one place to another, up a mountain, down a mountain. It was in the winter, people came back frozen. They were lucky they came back frozen because they were bought from the families. They went and paid up some money to the Judenrat and they were able to send a certain amount back. Then the Judenrat sent other people there, mobilized other people. They didn\u2019t want to go, they came to the house, it was Jewish police already, and they took them. There was no question, there was no place where to run. These people they came back, one of my friends came back and he had one of his toes frozen up completely, more than one."

From there they would take me to the camp but once they were taken October to camp already, I didn\u2019t report after that, I just stayed home."

All the main offices from the German authorities were in that city, not in the other cities, was in that state like in that part of the county. They had police, they had Gestapo, they had zonderdees, they had all kinds of different civilian authorities. All these people needed labor for nothing. They were taking some to clean homes, offices for the Germans; they were taking women, young girls or women. To do heavier labor, they would take men. If some factory was short of some kind of labor, they\u2019d tell the Judenrat, I need 50 people today, I need 30 people today and they would have to supply. Q Was there any violence at that time against Jews? ",
                " Well, there was, but again it was on a very small scale. The Germans used to come at night even though there was no ghetto yet but they used to come in the Jewish section. They would come to a certain house and take away the silverware and other things. They would just come and take it. Some would walk in dogs and they would see a Jew with a beard, they would let the dog go and sic him or they\u2019d catch one, they\u2019d cut his beard off in the street. They wanted to beat somebody, there were cases where some people were beaten up. That\u2019s why I tried not to be on the street at all, not to show myself. Being we lived outside, we didn\u2019t live in the middle of the town, I could do it. People that live in the town had no choice because the police were there, the others were there and that\u2019s where they were walking, day and night. They also had the -- 1t was something like nobody could have a radio. They went into one house and they spotted a radio. So they took the whole family. First the man that had the radio went away, they found a radio, he went out, he went away. They said if they don\u2019t find him, the Jewish community would not find that man, they would kill the people from the house, this family. I don\u2019t recall already what happened, did they shot the whole family or did they got the man back because word came to him about how they\u2019re going to kill the family. Also later, with the fur, they caught some fur in somebody\u2019s house and they killed the family, the whole family. But on a scale like, a big scale, no, not yet. "

What I say main ghetto is, there were separated by one of the main streets of the city. That side was separated and there was a main street running through the town from one end to the other, to the railroad station. The majority was on the right side of that thing and we were on the left side. Of course, we could not go from one to the other except during the day, certain hours. We were not allowed to be from six o\u2019clock on or five, I think from six o\u2019clock on, we were not allowed to be on the street at all. It was a curfew like for the Jewish people, you could not be on the street. If they caught you on the street you could be shot. In order to cross from one ghetto to the other, also you expose yourself because there was the main street. There could be German traffic, it could be Ukrainian police traffic and very seldom did I venture from here to there except on a Sunday. On a Sunday, the Germans did their thing home and it was like a -- there was no business going on like that. I ventured on a Sunday to the main ghetto and I had a lot of friends there and on the streets and so on."

But then after April 1*', they started to bring into the ghetto, people from surrounding communities, from little villages, not little villages where the Jews were killed already, from little towns. They didn\u2019t want little ghettos in each town. Their plan was to concentrate in biggest cities so they can get to them better. They brought in more people and that made it worse. Not only just with food, there\u2019s no place where to stay. People slept in hallways; it was a pity for those people that they came from outside. We were in already there with people, more or less established. But it didn\u2019t last that long. It lasted till August and they liquidated, they made actions, they started actions."

Some survived that they went to Russia; they managed to get there. Some survived, maybe 150 or so. But the few that survived, we didn\u2019t want to be there because everything was against us.
