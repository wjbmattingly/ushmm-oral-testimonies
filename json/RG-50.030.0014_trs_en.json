And I remember just one instance that \u0152 you know, although we weren't religious, but it was still when you sat in Denmark in those days, you had to sit with your hands folded like when you were quiet. But being it was a Jewish school and we shouldn't make a cross, 1 Ma\u2122oz Tzur Yeshu\u2122ati [Stronghold and Rock of My Salvation] (Hebrew); popular Chanukah song. 3 we sat with our hands without, without folding them, like this. It was just a, a little memory, but it was interesting. And we went to school, I think it was from eight to two, like all other schools. And I don't know if we learned Hebrew. Denmark is really not a religious \u0152 even the Jews weren't religious in those days, but it was a Jewish school. I, I remember some of my friends. I remember one friend from the class kept saying \u0152 this was only in like 1941 or '42 \u0152 that she heard rumors that the Germans were going to do something to the Jews. But that was like a year before it really happened that there were big boats waiting in the harbor to take the Jews. But we sort of didn't believe her. It proved to be right in the long run, but this was like a year before. One of my classmates\u0152 01:05:57"

We went to Jewish schools. All, all Christian schools, whatever public schools, whatever. I mean maybe because I was so young.

We went to small hills. I had a very good childhood. I played tennis. My father was an avid tennis player so we would always rent houses at the beach where there were tennis courts. And we always had a maid and I just remember everything as being very pleasant and nice. Some of the memories are, I am sure, from when we came back, because you have to remember I was young when we fled. 01:07:29"

It was on a Friday night and we shouldn't \u0152 4 none of us should go home to our apartments or houses. And I remember we had a maid and she just took care of the apartment. She stayed home, and we went. I remember, my father, mother, sister and I and an uncle who was married to a non-Jew, he also wanted to flee with us, and his wife stayed home \u0152 stayed in their apartment because they wouldn't \u0152 they weren't going to touch, touch the non-Jews. So the five of us \u0152 I remember, I \u0152 we put on two, two dresses and a toothbrush in the pocket. That's all we fled with. And we went and.... Would you like to hear about how we fled? We went to the train. No. First \u0152 I remember \u0152 first, we knew it would cost to flee. We would have to pay. We knew that fisherman were going to charge about 2,000 crowns a head. That's what we were told. So my father took a cab. On the same day in Copenhagen he went to the bank and he took money out and I remember he brought my mother also. We were told that we shouldn't take money to Sweden because we weren't going to use them. And he bought a bracelet, as a matter of fact, for my mother. And when I was 50, she sent me \u0152 she send it to me. And this is the one that she sent me. And that is what he bought and I saw it had gotten smaller, narrower, but I thought maybe as a child I remember it as being bigger. But now that my mother passed away two years ago and I inherit the other bracelet which is exactly the same, but just much wider. I have that at home. But I remember that. He went to the bank, took the money, bought bracelet for my mother and the rest of the money he took in his pocket to pay the fisherman. And then he went home and we all got dressed and like I said, we had two dresses on. It was October so I guess a coat you would wear. Remember was two dresses instead of one. And my father probably had two suits. That I don't remember, but my sister and I had two dresses on and a \u0152 we each had a toothbrush. We bought new toothbrushes and put in our pockets and then we went to the train station. And strangely enough, nobody stopped us. Not the Germans either. I mean you could see people coming out on the train and there was no, no, no\u0152nobody stopped us and we went up from Copenhagen to Snekkersten, which is a place that's closest at the seashore to Sweden. I mean, my father took care of everything. We were kids. 01:10:19"

            "answer": "I remember sitting there and being a little scared, but I didn't really know what being scared meant because we hadn't experienced anything bad. So it was a little bit of an excitement for me. And I also think we did have one suitcase along, but I am not l00 percent sure. But I just knew that nobody stopped us. Nobody came over and there were no Germans on the train to inspect it. Later on, you see all these stories of people being asked to show passports. It wasn't \u0152 didn't happen. The only thing that happened was, while we were away that they would \u0152 they came to our apartment to ask for us. That I know and I know that our maid said when she opened the door. They knocked, Friday night, on the door. We weren't home. This is just what we heard. They knocked on everybody's door. They had a list from the synagogue about all the Jews, where we lived and she said \u0152 when she opened and asked for us, she said, \"They wouldn\u2122t be so stupid to stay home.\" And she just closed the door. They didn't go in. They didn't \u0152 maybe they went in to look, but they didn't take anything from the 5 apartment. They left everything intact. A nd as a matter of fact, I don't know if I am wondering if I should continue. My father had bought a house. We lived in an apartment in the suburb of Denmark [Copenhagen], and he had bought a house meanwhile. But we didn't get to move into it and when, when we came back from Sweden, we moved into the house. It was furnished and everything and he rented it out to a woman before we left, and that woman married a German soldier or Kommandant. 2 So when we came home from Sweden \u0152 my memories are coming back now \u0152 there were Hitler's picture all over the wall. And the movers were, you know, like the Danish movers, they kicked and it was like they kicked all the pictures down from the wall and you know they were very angry. But otherwise the house was standing and, you know, a lot of furniture was there and then we moved into when we came back from Sweden. 01:12:24"

            "question": "Okay. Let's go back to the train ride.",
            "answer": "Meanwhile, let's go back to the train ride. We were on the train ride. It takes about 30 minutes, the train ride from Copenhagen to Snekkersten. I don't know why my father knew to get off at from Snekkersten. He didn't know anybody there except that he was closest to Sweden, and we got off the train station, went down the stairs, you know, out off the train and a man comes to us. Tall, I don't remember his face exactly. He was \u0152 he looked he would be about 40 years old at that time. And he said, \"I know why you are here. I am Mr. Bagge, Herr Bagge.3 Please come with me.\ufb02 And we just followed him and we came into a big white house and he said, \"Just stay with me. I'll take care of you \u201atil we find you a fishing boat to take you to Sweden.\" And he took about a week. We stayed there and you know, we had \u0152 it was upstairs. We stayed in his house. And everyday \u0152 my father's blond so he didn't look Jewish, so he and Mr. Bagge would go \u0152 I mean my mother and I were dark or I wouldn't have gone. But my father was blond and he went with Mr. Bagge every day down to the \u0152 to see if you could get a fishing boat to take us to Sweden. You know, you had to get a man that would take us and pay and everything. And it was hard because everybody was trying to flee at the same time. And one day my father came home and said he got a rowboat instead. He couldn't get a fishing boat. He got a rowboat. So we would go that night. And we all got dressed and were ready to leave and then he didn't come to pick us, the man. And they said that \u0152 I think he did come and he shows his hands and they had big blisters on it from the night before and he couldn't row again he said. So we couldn't go. And then, I think it took one or two more days, my father came back and he said \u0152 I mean, he came back every time with Mr. Bagge \u0152 that they found somebody would take us the next day at three o'clock. It was during the day, which itself was strange that we were able to flee during the day, but I was told later on that the Germans were paid off. So, the Germans that were guarding the harbor, it was a harbor, wouldn't say anything. So that day we just walked down from Mr. Bagge's house. I remember when we left, I remember his kitchen had a big picture window 2 Commander (German) 3 Mr. Bagge (Danish) 6 and he turned around and he cried and he just hoped we would get over there safely. He was such a wonderful man. I mean he risked his life and he didn't do it just for us. He did it, lots of people went through his house. And every October second \u0152 we fled October second, and that day my father would always send him a present in silver to commemorate the day. I just heard that he had died now. But I don't know when, but he died an old man. But he really saved many, many people. So we walked down to the fishing boat and I remember was the going down \u0152 you know this fishing boat has where the fish is usually square opening? We went way downstairs and we were with 14 people. It took more than us, and it was a family that I knew and I met the children. They were the same age as me. I just met them in Israel. Their name was Marcus. I remember and they had an old aunt along and she \u0152 I remember her putting her foot down, in the fishing boat to go down and she said, \"Oh, I forgot my umbrella. I have to go home and get it.\" And my father took her leg and pulled it down and said, \"You are not going back home. We are leaving.\" 01:15:38 And, and then we all sat around, you know, was very dark down there, and they closed up the, the opening of the boat and then the fisherman came on board and we left. And I remember everybody being seasick and I was a little child. I mean how old I was in '40? Six years old? And I remember I was so proud of myself. I was the only one not being seasick. And we stayed very quietly and the boat went out. And when we were in the middle of the ocean between Sweden \u0152 it was about 30 minutes into Sweden \u0152 between Sweden and Denmark, a big boat came and we were afraid it was Germans because there were soldiers on it. They were dressed \u0152 they looked just like Germans. But it was a Swedish patrol boat that came to pick us up. They came in Swedish waters. They were allowed to go out and the Germans couldn't . And then we were safe. The Germans couldn't do anything. They came a big boat and they helped us up from the fishing boat and we stayed on the deck. Then we were, we were saved. And we went into a little harbor in Sweden. I think it was right outside of Helsingborg. Yeah, Helsingborg. And, you know, they're welcoming us; and they all look like Germans because the Swedes \u0152 they were wearing the same dresses and we came in and we got coffee, tea and they told us where we could stay. They put us actually in the Grand Hotel. It's called the Grand Hotel. They paid for the suites, paid for everything and they said we could stay there \u201atil if we had any relatives in Sweden we could go to them. I think we stayed about a week. Every day my parents would go down to the harbor to see if my grandparents had come. They will still \u0152 and an old aunt I had, my grandfather's sister, they were still in Denmark when we fled. And a few days later, four, five days later they came on another fishing boat. I am not sure where they came from, but I know that everyday my parents went down to hear if they had come. And we were all saved. And we stayed in the hotel, until my father \u0152 my mother had relatives, an uncle in Malm\u00f6, so we went to them. And I remember in that apartment there were lots of other Danes, relatives and I remember we slept on one of these beds you pull out for two, and we slept all four in them. And, and the only sad thing I remember from there was \u0152 remember I was only six or seven \u0152 that the other children that were there, they had some relatives that bought them a little doll and I didn't get a doll. I remember still that I was very unhappy I didn't get that doll. But we stayed 7 with this family. You see my father was young. My father must have been at that time when he's born in 1906 so he was 30, 40 years old at that time. He got out and got a job. First, he got an apartment for us, \u201acause he had some money along, and he got us an apartment \u0152 \ufb01V\u00e4stergatan,\ufb02 small apartment. I remember we had to buy it furnished with real junky, furniture we bought it and we stayed there. 01:18:55"

I remember my uncle was there too. But I think that they did give us money. That's right. The Swedes gave us money. They gave us coupons to eat so we could go into a beautiful restaurant to eat. And they gave us money, pocket money until we got ourselves \u0152 I mean they were wonderful, the Swedes \u0152 \u201atil we got ourselves established. My father got a job right away selling artificial teeth. He would travel. I remember the little package with the teeth and he would travel and come home and he got, you know, salary for that. My mother got a job in a store. What is that called? With women's clothes, lingerie? These were Swedish people either that we knew before. I think that my parents must have known them. And my sister got a job. My sister was five years older. I think she was watching children, little children.

I didn't \u0152 my best friend I remember had another apartment. Her parents had another apartment. At the same street they rented another apartment. We would get together to play and \u0152 so, I didn't do anything \u201atil they started opening a school in Sweden, a Danish school in Lund. I think it was after we had been there a few months or maybe even half a year. They opened the school and I would go and I went into third grade. And my sister was five grades ahead of me. And then we would go everyday to school like in Denmark. They would make it with the Principal was Danish. Her name was Lachman. And there was another very good teacher. His name was Bertelsen. He 4 Refugee (Danish) 8 wrote a book later on about it. He wrote a book called October 2, 1943. Aage Bertelsen. He was a head teacher, the headmaster. And she was the Principal. And we went to a little \u0152 I went to a little school. It was like a school and a big school, probably like elementary and more of a high school. And it was very pleasant. It was a 20-minute ride with a train to V\u00e4stergatan, from Malm\u00f6 to Lund. And we had regular school \u0152 we work. And my sister, of course, stopped working also. She went to school. She went to \u0152 it's called mellemskole, 5 the middle school. Probably like ninth or 10th grade. And I remember for lunch, they had a place where we all would go to eat. It would be for kosher and non-kosher. A big place! And I also remember I had piano lessons in Sweden after hours, I remember. So we lived a pretty regular life. And then my father got this other job, which was better paid, I guess, working for his friends selling teeth. That he did the rest of the, of the occupation. And, I mean, life went on. It was a very good time for us. There was nothing, no hardship. We, you know, they \u0152 like they gave us money \u201atil we could \u0152 very soon my father, you know, got the job, and my mother.

You marry. But we really did not feel any difference, there was \u0152 of being Jewish or not Jewish in Denmark didn't. My husband might tell you different stories.
