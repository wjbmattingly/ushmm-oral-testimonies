The thirdlayeroftheJewishsocietywaspeople thatbelievethatYiddish isthelanguage oftheJewishpeople. Therewereveryfamous \ufb01Ragymnasium\ufb02[?](88)thatweretaught onlyinJewish andthechildrenweresenttothisschool.They weretaught Yiddishand theywere speakingbetweenthemselves alsoinYiddish. Therewere likethreelayers ofJewish society.Unfortunately, myparentswere veryassimilatedand they,because oftheirprofessionalbackground, feltthattheRussianrevolutionandtheRussianlanguage iskindofsalvationforallpeople.Theybelieved inalltheideals thatsoundedveryniceonpaperbut unfortunately fellapartlater. Anthony: Soyouwoulddescribe yourparentsasbeingSocialistsatthattime? Lily:No,theywere notSocialist, Imeanmaybe asyoungstudents.

Sotheywereveryidealistic andverymuchforequal rightsforeverybody.Anthony: Wouldyoudescribe yourparentsasbeing secular,moresecularthanreligious? Lily:Verysecular,verysecular.Asamatteroffact,Ididn't knowthatIwasJewishuntil Iwenttoschool.Itwasavery hardexperienceformebecause alotofpeoplethatIwenttoschool,thechildren, werefromreligiousfamilies.WhenIwenttoschoolthefirstday,mynannyprepared memylunch.

Anthony: Didyouliveinamainly Jewish neighborhood orwasitamixedneighborhood? Lily:Itwasamixed neighborhood. Welivednearbyfromthemedical faculty ofthe university.Iremember theriots,itstartedatthe synagogue riotsanditwasveryhardfortheJewtogotoamedical university, amedical college.InPoland, itwasdifferent.Whenyoufinishedhigh school,youdidn't gotocollege. Yougoright awaytouniversityandyouhadtomakeupyourmind what youwantedtostudy.Nowhere,hereyougotocollegeandthen yougotomedical school ortolaw school.Overthere,itwasdifferent. ItwasveryhardforaJewtogoinand studymedicine. FromthewholeschoolthatIwentto, itwasaprivateschool,justonepersonwasacceptedperyearforaperiod oftwoorthreeyears.Sothosefewmedical students thatwereintheuniversitystudyingmedicine, Jewish, were reallypersecuted. There wasatime thattheywere notallowedtosit. They wereassignedspecial seatsontheleft. They rebelledandtheywere standing upandtheywere takingnotesduring thelecture. Imetsomepeople afterliberationthatweremedical students inVilna andthey weretellingmeaboutthosetimes. I,myself,rememberthat there were riotsandmymothercamerunning toschooltopick meupbecause shewasafraidthat Ishouldbeassaultedbythosepeople thatwere just riotingnearby wherewewereliving. Anthony:DoyouknowwhyyourparentssentyoutoaprivateJewishschool? Lily:Myparents wanted metohavethe besteducationandthis wasavery fineschool, oneofthebest.IwishIcouldgivemychildren thekindofeducationthatIandmysisterhadaschildren.Theprofessorswereveryeducated; theywerehighly dedicated. Most ofthestudents were motivated.Therewere some children thatwent therejusttopleasetheir parentsand triedtogetaway butwehadmovies,wehadachemical laboratory,wehadaphysics laboratory;wehad fieldtrips;wehadagym,gym wasimportant;wehadallkinds ofvisualaidstomaketheeducationmoreinteresting. Alsowhenwehad French Revolution, theywere teaching usaboutFrench Revolution.Itwasnotthattheytoldusabout RobespierreandMarat, butwehad amock judgment. Therewasajudge assigned; therewassomebodywho wasMarat, whowasRobespierreandsomebodythatwasjustfromthepeople.Thehistory, allofasudden, became alive.

This isthereasonIwassentthere.Anthony: Howwouldyoucharacterizerelations betweenJewsandnonJewsinVilna?Lily:TherewerealotofantiSemites. Ithink thatItoldinthepreviousinterview thatmyfatherwasreally havingaveryhardtimewhenhewent foranexam. Yousee,myfatherwasworking inapharmacy. Thiswasapharmacy fromaverybigpharmacy thatwasfrom thecitypharmacy. Every workerthatworkedhadakindofinsurance.Whenheneeded aprescription, hewenttothispharmacy.Itwasaverybigoutfit; itwascalled\ufb01Casa Horich\ufb02[phonetic] (324). Itwaslikeabiginsurancefortheworkers.Fromthis pharmacy wasemployed alotofpharmacists, onlythreeJewishpharmacists wereemployed. In1935,thosethreepharmacists were toldthat theydon'thave enougheducation;theyhavetogoandpassatest.Theycannotdojustasimplepharmacist;theyhavetohaveMastersinpharmacy. ItwascalledMagisterderPharmazie.Herewasmyfather,ayoungman,withawifeandtwo children, andhehadtogotoworkandalso study.Iremember thatheusedtogoanddig upallkindsofherbsandstudyallkinds ofthings.Heusedtoclosehimselfandstudywhatever,hejusthadachance. Then hewentforthetest. Thetest wasinthemedical facultyoftheuniversity. Unfortunately therewasaprofessorthereandhisnamewasMacheski,oneofthe biggest antiSemites. Hepassedthewrittentestandthenhepassedthe oraltest.Ashewascoming out,heaskedhim, bythe way,whatisthechemical formulaforcarbonatedwater? Myfather wassounnervedthathegotamental blockandhedidn't answerhim. Hedidn't passthetest. Sohehadtostudyagainand hehadtotraveltoWarsaw.Hewentthere andhepassedthetestthere.Irememberwhenhesentusatelegram, \"Ipassed!\" anditwasoneofthebiggestjoysforus.Butitdidn'ttakelongandallthree Jewishpharmacists weretoldthattheyhadtogo.Theydidn'twant aJewtohaveacivilservicejob. Anthony: Soeventhough hegottheMastersand hequalified,hestilllost?Lily:Yes,helost.Thenwehadlikeafamilypowwow.Helostthejob.Wedidn't know whattodo.Soitwasdecided thateverybody willhelp him andhewillhavetobuyapharmacybecause hecouldn't get ajob.When hewent tobuyapharmacy,hefoundapharmacyinaplace called Soy[Salos],Soly.AsaJew,hecouldn\u2122t buythe pharmacysosomehowhefoundaPolish pharmacist whosenamewasVishnefski.Hegavehimasumofmoney, thisVishnefskibought the pharmacy andmyfatherwastheownerandheworkedthere. ThisVishnefskiwasnot eventhere.Thiswasin1938. Anthony: That'swhenhelosttheshop? Lily:Helosthisjobin1936or1937.Forayearorayearandahalf,hedidn'twork.TherewerealotofantiSemites. Anthony: Didyounoticewhetherthere wasanydifferencebetween PolesandLithuanians, forexample? Lily:Well,actually, Ididn't getintouch duringmychildhood toomuch withLithuanians. Istartedtoknow Lithuanians when,in1940, Russiatookoveranditthenbecame Lithuania.Soforayear,youknow,but\u2013alsoIgotintouch withLithuanianswhentheywereguarding the ghetto. Theywereverytall,the:policemen.Weusedtocallthem\ufb01aniterate\ufb02[?] (391), this howtalltheywere.Lithuanians werealsoveryantiSemitic, veryantiSemitic, especially thosewho weresympathizerswiththe Germans. Anthony: Ifyouhadtocomparethetwo,wouldyousaythatonewasworsethanthe other?Lithuanian antiSemitismorPolish? Lily:Iwouldsaytheywerejustbothofthem werebad.Itishardtocompare. Anthony: Earlier,youmentionedthat there were someantiSemitic pogroms? Lily:Theywere actuallynot pogroms. Theywereriotsbetween the students,between thePolishstudents andtheJewishstudentsandtheuniversity. Anthony:Butyouwere protected from allthatbecause youwere stillgoingtotheJewishschool?Lily: Iwasprotected because, first ofallIwas alittle girland IwasgoingtoaJewishschool.Anthony: Howaboutyour mother?Whowereher clients?
