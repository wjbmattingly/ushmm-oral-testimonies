But last week it was lovely, for a week, for a few days and it\u2019s getting hot again. But I don\u2019t think that bothers me that much.

Ms. Klein has been interviewed twice before, so we\u2019re going to focus this interview on areas of questioning that haven\u2019t been discussed in those other two interviews. And those interviews were conducted by, the first one was conducted by Mary K. Tachau in January 1982. And that interview is now in the collection of the University of Louisville, Kentucky. And the second interview was a Survivors of the Shoah Foundation interview that was conducted on April 22\u2122, 1996. So, we\u2019re going to start out by summarizing, more or less, what was said in 1 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection those interviews, which were very thorough, particularly the Mary K. Tachau interview. And filling in on a few questions and then we\u2019ll go on and mostly focus on Ms. Klein\u2019s life in Kentucky. So, I\u2019m going to just read this summary and you tell me if I\u2019ve gotten anything wrong. Actually, first of all before we start, you were born in October ninth, 1921 in Eger, Hungary. I was interested in hearing before we go on from there, something about your family history. Do you know anything about your family history?",
            "answer": "Yes, as much as I know. People in those days didn\u2019t go into a lot of details. But my father was born in 1880 and my mother was born in 1879."

            "num": 9,
            "question": "Can you give their names, including her maiden name?",
            "answer": "Yes. My mother\u2019s maiden name was Frida Weisz and my father\u2019s name was B\u00e9la Low. In Hungarian we would say Low B\u00e9la and Weisz Frida, you know the last name comes first. My father worked in a bank that was a chain. The main office was in Budapest. And then different cities would had branches. It was called at the time, and I don\u2019t know whether you want to know it in Hungarian. It was called the Magyar Atolanos Hitel Bank. Magyar means... and the Hitel Bank was the name of the outfit. My father became, first he probably was a clerk and I would not remember that. And actually married my mother, who was working in that bank before. That\u2019s how they apparently met. This was a second marriage for my father, because his wife, the first wife, died maybe after two years of marriage, and then he married my mom. And she was born in Fegyvernek, Hungary and my father was born in a little town called Tiszafured, Hungary. Now, my father became the manager of the bank and so those are the years I would remember. In Hungarian, they were called the izgazgato (ph) of the bank, but here you would call the manager, I think, or the director of that bank. And he did work there for a while. We lived in a house, a little bit away from downtown. And when I was four years old we moved into the same building where the bank was, above the bank there was a nice big apartment. And we were very comfortable in my house. I remember we had pretty gardens and so on and so forth, up to the age of four. And after that we lived downtown. So all I remember that toward the end, I think my father was supposedly had to retire, already maybe at age sixty, where people here maybe retire only in sixty-five. They had a lovely and very nice ceremony for him. In fact, I owned\u2014 but unfortunately I don\u2019t own anymore\u2014they gave him a silver wreath, which the employees, all the employees\u2019 names were signed on. And they gave a lovely, nice speech at his retirement. I do have a picture of that, by the way. You know, I was really lucky that either relatives or maybe it was left in the house. I have more pictures than many other people who lost everything. We lost everything, but still for example, and if you would be interested toward the end, I would show you that picture. He\u2019s sitting at the desk and that was the time he retired from the bank. And my mother, after... she had three children, so she didn\u2019t work, so that was before they got married, I think, that she was like a secretary, maybe, in the bank. So, that\u2019s what my parents... except then he had a very good friend, who lived in Budapest. He wasn\u2019t a Jewish guy, who had vineyards in our hometown. Because our hometown, Eger is very famous of its wine and vineyards. And as a friendship, that wasn\u2019t really a paid job, he helped that friend to take care of the vineyard. I mean, not so much take care, because he had employees, but look after it a little bit. And they had an apple orchard and he was doing that. So, we went out to that vineyard many times. And it was a pleasant way that I remember my childhood. You don\u2019t want to know much about my childhood, no more like about my parents. 2 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I know absolutely nothing of the family history on my mother\u2019s side, except that she had two sisters and we were close to the sisters. But not previously what happened to the father or mother or when they died. Nothing. My father\u2019s mother died when I was five years old and I do remember that, because, you know, in Jewish funerals, you know, there was a black casket, and we were... but when my grandfather died, I do not remember that. I think he died, might have died before I ever was born."

And there for a few days, then from there, loaded onto cattle cars and taken to Auschwitz, where you were separated from your parents. You worked in the kitchen in Auschwitz.",

She was from Yugoslavia, actually, from the town of Isad (ph), which nowadays is very much in the news. And she\u2019s really the one, who I kept close.

            "answer": "Nothing. I never kept in touch with any of the others, except one other girl, who was from our hometown. And I don\u2019t even believe we worked in the kitchen together, but towards, during the Death March, we ran into each other. She was older than I am. She used to be a seamstress. And in my stories, I think it\u2019s mentioned that on some of the train rides, after we were already liberated, we were together. And I do know what happened to her. And she lives, she remarried. She had a husband earlier and then she remarried and they, to my surprise, they lived in Berlin. And he died in the meantime. I think he was an artist. And although I never thought I want to go back to Germany, but at one point, with some friends from here, we did a two weeks tour in Germany, which took us to Berlin, too. And my, another friend who knew of her, gave me her address and phone number. And I wrote to her and she came over to see, visit me in the hotel. That\u2019s the first time I have seen her after Auschwitz times. And she still lives in Berlin. She\u2019s much older than I am, so at times I\u2019ve heard that she\u2019s kind of ill. So, I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing. I have a feeling her husband was originally from Berlin and then, you know, I think they were getting money after the Holocaust and they made their home there."

That\u2019s the way we always knew her and I do not know what her next husband\u2019s name was. So, we called her Rosenfeld, B6zsi and she was from Eger. So. And that\u2019s all. I never kept up with anybody else. I don\u2019t know what happened to them. But I agree with you that I did talk about five girls a lot together, but they were not from my hometown. And as I said in my stories, that my memory is not that good. Certain things are very vivid in my mind and certain things like it never happened. So, I can\u2019t give you any names."

            "answer": "She worked... yeah, I remember, she worked in the kitchen and we met. And she\u2019s exactly my age and somehow we liked each other. And then what has happened, that after that people were separated a lot, transports were leaving, and my husband\u2019s two sisters were in Auschwitz, but they were taken away to Germany. And they worked like, the so-called forced labor, now in factories or whatever. But then we came so close and when people were separated from their so- called loved ones, of course our parents were gone, but we didn\u2019t know exactly what happened to them. We somehow decided that we just never want to separate from each other. And we did become good friends to the last minute. And I told you that, maybe, or I might have said it in the video, that my husband thinks that maybe I survived because of her and she thinks maybe because of me. But she was a bright girl and lot more outgoing or spoke lot of languages and ' Born Ilus Fleischman; later lived in Israel and changed her name to Ilana Fried. 4 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection therefore she was very informed of lot of things what were happening after the January so-called Death March. She met people more, and so, I got some information from her, which she remembered and I never remembered myself."

            "question": "Was her situation similar to yours, in that she had lost her parents, she had been separated from her parents in Auschwitz, and they were... ?",
            "answer": "Yes, and I do not remember the details of her background, although we used to talk about that, I assume. But I do not recall it. Well everybody lost their parents the same way, but I don\u2019t even remember if she was taken out with her parents together or not. So, I cannot give you any information about that. Then later she got married and they moved to Israel. And we kept up. In fact, last year I was in Hungary and she came to Hungary, to Budapest and spent a week. So we saw each other then. And unfortunately now, she lives in Netanya. Have you ever been in Israel, yourself? And the last I heard of her, she was hit by a car. And she doesn\u2019t have any family anymore, because she never had any children. Her husband died years ago. She might have a niece or some, so she was very, very down with the idea of that she had enough already during concentration camp. And she was first in the hospital for a long time. Then she was in some sort of a nursing home situation, because I think she had a broken hip and whatever. And in that age, she\u2019s very little and fragile. And then she is now back in her apartment. She doesn\u2019t like to write, but she calls once in a while and I write. I write more than I call, because in a short conversation you cannot... but she\u2019s somewhat better, but pretty depressed by the whole situation. Because she says it was very painful, and really nobody who can take care of her except nurses would come to the place. And so I felt very sorry about that, because I used to say that and now she must have felt the same way, that one tragedy was enough, how many more do you have to have? And for her, you know, that was an additional something that she certainly wasn\u2019t looking forward to. That\u2019s all."

            "answer": "Well Ilus I met later, somewhat later, not even in the beginning of my kitchen work. Later, because I worked first in one part of the kitchen, then in another part. And I think we met a little bit later. But I don\u2019t know, you have talked to a lot of Holocaust survivors, and I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m just so naive or I was so naive at the time. Because you know, I even read right now, just last week, I read a book, you probably read it, Night of Eli Wiesel. Have you read that book?"

And you know, the stories I hear of people, you know, when they arrived and they would see the smoke and they maybe right away would have known what that is. Or maybe if somebody told them, they believed it. Well, I am either very naive... I could never have believed anything like that. We did see the smoke, and the people who were there already, the first two or three years, they of course knew exactly what was going on. They were from Poland 5 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection or Russia and they would tell us. But I assumed that they were kind of jealous that we were coming just in the last minute of the war. See, they were already suffering for three years and suffered quite a bit, you can imagine. And whoever survived that three years, they were pretty tough and kind of mean. Because a lot of the kapos in the barracks were Jewish refugees, I mean not refugees, but prisoners from way back. And I used to think that they just want to scare us, or they tell us stories which is so unbelievable. So, I never thought about that since my parents disappeared that first day, that they would have been burned."

Even, even this Eli Wiesel said that in Hungary they did not know anything about Auschwitz. We did not know anything about Auschwitz. And I don\u2019t think my parents did. At the same time, my parents were very protective, too. They were the type of people that they didn\u2019t want to scare you. Even if they would have known a little bit more, they did not discuss that. And if we would listen to the Voice of America, which I said in my interviews before about what\u2019s going on and we would hear Hitler screaming and yelling. The concentration camps were not... we did not know anything about it. Like when we\u2019re in the train, I never knew where we are going, and I never was afraid that it\u2019s going to be Auschwitz, because I did not know anything about that. And I am talking only about myself. You can talk to somebody else maybe and they have an entire different... and you want to know my feelings. We were going somewhere and it was miserable, but we didn\u2019t know where."

            "answer": "I mean, later in... when we would have believed that they really... I can\u2019t remember when that came to our mind, you know. For a long, long time we thought that, you know, our parents are somewhere in another camp and taking care of the kids who were also taken away from people. Well, I was the youngest, and I didn\u2019t have, but as I told you in one of the stories, that my sister- in-laws had little children, a four and a six year old. Well, they wouldn\u2019t have imagined that they were burned in the gas chambers. They would have thought that the mother was taking care of the kids in a different kind of a camp. When did we came to the realization? Toward the very end. I think maybe even during the Death March, and we heard this over and over and over again, we assumed maybe. But it wasn\u2019t that it just happened one day. And I never remember really, crying that suddenly now I might not have my parents anymore. It is just... everything was so gradual that I couldn\u2019t recall anything like that. And I wanted to get back to Hungary. By then, I kind of knew that I\u2019m not going to find my parents there, but I had big hopes that I would find my brothers, because I didn\u2019t know what happened to them. Of course, I didn\u2019t find them either, and I have mentioned that in some of my interviews. But when did that happen? I don\u2019t really know. (Doorbell rings.)

            "answer": "Yeah, well I could even cry now, but see what it 1s, that what amazes me, that during that time that we were in that camp and so many horrible things were going on, I don\u2019t remember really ever crying. You know? The shock was so great. And afterwards, see, when I got back to Hungary, there was just, it was such a trauma, the whole thing, that you know, it was almost like you were, like you were under the influence of some sort of magical thing that everything hit you all at once. And so, I don\u2019t, of course I, even now, and you know I have pictures, or when I couldn\u2019t find my brothers. But it\u2019s funny, I wasn\u2019t... it\u2019s not funny at all, but I apparently didn\u2019t cry that easily. I mean I might have held it back more. And the tears come now, for example, I see a program on television, not about the Holocaust, but about something, a little kid getting hurt or little... I can so easily cry and have tears, you know, over that, but with this big event what happened, that was just so much, that I... I didn\u2019t... like that we go to the cemetery when we are in my hometown, because they have a memorial for the adults and then they have a special one for the kids. My family\u2019s names are on it. And it\u2019s just, you know, you\u2019re just under, it\u2019s a shock kind of, which never left me for ever, ever and ever, you know? Then I had other traumas yet, which I might have talked about it or I might have not. But I don\u2019t want to jump ahead of myself. You ask me the question."

            "answer": "I don\u2019t know, I think that what made me survive, that I must be kind of tough. Or maybe I was brought up in a nice family home and I didn\u2019t have any upsetting situations. But I think it has a lot to do, that some people are stronger for some reason and some people are not that strong. And I was able to handle many situations which for other people might have been very dramatic and I could do it. So, it must be my personality that I was able to... to survive, no. No? Because you can get sick and you can die or they can kill you. But maybe the feeling that you don\u2019t give up easily. Or it\u2019s like in my story, I might have said some that we had lice and we would spend hours trying to get rid of the lice. Or if we were starving, you know, I was able to... then I was lucky that I didn\u2019t get really sick. I mean, that I don\u2019t think has anything to do with one\u2019s personality. You may be stronger, and I\u2019m a pretty strong person. But in those days, you know, being out in January and February, you could have gotten anything and just died, but I didn\u2019t. And that I considered luck. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a personality. Somebody who is stronger, maybe can endure all that. So I\u2019m not sure exactly what might have caused that, that I was able to deal with it better than maybe the other people, who even now, maybe... I hate it that they have nightmares about it and they remember all the horrible things. I think about it a lot and I remember them, but I deal with it, except sometimes it looks to me that, that wasn\u2019t me. That had to be somebody else, because up to this moment, I can\u2019t believe and can\u2019t understand how in the world somebody can survive it. And then talk about it later in life. It\u2019s... I have a hard time understanding that and I still feel that way."

They died the way, you know how they did. And at the same time I tried to compromise with it. I mean, I\u2019m not trying to forgive Hitler 7 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But if I saw younger people with their mother doing the same things I was doing and they would beat that mother or that mother was starving, you know? Just the thought of that for me would have been horrible. So, the way I think now that they suddenly were killed and they didn\u2019t suffer. That makes me feel almost better than if I would have gone with them maybe for half a year and then slowly they would have died. Because they were in their sixties, they weren\u2019t young. Some people were only maybe in their forties. But when I was born, my mother was already forty years old, so she had to be 63 some years old. And in those days those were already old people, but they were healthy people. I never seen them sick or, you know, in bed, in fact, with a sickness. So, to me, seeing them suffer right next to you would have been almost worse. I mean, I don\u2019t know if anybody ever felt that way. Because if they could have survived the whole thing, that\u2019s a different story, but at that age, not many older people could survive it. So.

Well, let\u2019s, I have some questions about the things that you brought up, but let\u2019s try to get back to them later and we\u2019 ll get back right now to the summary, to just finish saying what happened to you during the wartime. I believe when we left off, we mentioned that you were on a Death March. You were forced to go to Ravensbruck with this group of other girls and then we went off talking about what had become of them. So, you were in Ravensbriick for about three weeks.",

And I have already told that story, so I don\u2019t want to really repeat myself. The camps, unless you really would want to, I haven\u2019t looked at my notes again, many of the names I got from my friend, Ilus. Because she remembered names very well. But Ravensbriick really was the most famous one, but nobody... it wasn\u2019t really a camp for us anymore. It was gathering places. And wherever, like what you mentioned near Dresden, this Malchow, it wasn\u2019t that we were supposed to be working there or we were supposed to be doing anything there. It was just a stop during the wandering around or the trains and so on and so forth. So, the last part of it, which I (coughs) excuse me, I already mentioned before, on the open field, where I ran into a lot of the... even some people from my hometown, by then there were no camps, it was just... but by then the weather was a little bit better, because it was springtime. So we wouldn\u2019t suffer from ice and cold and so on. But our main and worse situation was in ice and cold and snow, trying to stop and sit down and possibly freeze to death. Is where my friend, Ilus and I kept ourselves from trying to avoid that if possible. Because we were told that, that can happen. But after that I couldn\u2019t tell you any of the real camps because then we ended up in Wurzen and that was..."

And that was taken care of in Wurzen. And after that, 1t took a while for that to heal, I assume.

            "answer": "Well, because, yeah, well, we were, they wanted to help us and that was only this friend of mine and myself. And yes, I remember that very clearly. They gave us real good food, I mean really food what we had never had before. Because, as I told you before, in Wurzen the first thing was I would eat the bag full of sugar and I would eat pickles. I mean that\u2019s alone a reason too, not to survive, I think, but then again, maybe I was strong or I don\u2019t get sick that easily. But after we heard about a transport, maybe from that area, leaving toward Hungary, we left them a note and we told them \u201cThank you very much, but we\u2019re going to try,\u201d and we got on the train. And that was a few more weeks of Czechoslovakia and all over the place. If I would look at my notes, I might even get some ideas around Bern, for example, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that important and that would really stretch it out. But the train was going slowly at different places. Now, my friend, the reason she remembered more, first of all, she spoke languages better. She spoke French, she spoke German. She was from Yugoslavia. She spoke the Slavic languages, so in Czechoslovakia she could understand some of the Czecho... so, she found out a lot of little things, exactly where we were. And I was immobilized because of that surgery on my arm. So my arm was all tied up, so I didn\u2019t run around as easily as she did. Like, the train would stop and then some people would bring up some food. That was, of course, after the war was over. Or she would go down, they asked her down to a kitchen and they give her something to eat and then she would bring some. But I just stayed put, because it was kind of hard for me to get around with that. And that was painful, because those things had to heal.

I was wondering about your, how you thought of yourself and how you remember yourself before the war. You mentioned that during the war you just didn\u2019t cry and that now you can cry at little things. But before the war was your personality that way? Did you ever cry then?",
            "answer": "No, I don\u2019t remember that I was... I wasn\u2019t pampered really, by my parents, although they had the means. But I remember... I don\u2019t think I was really spoiled. I was spoiled by them not to share bad news. So, that\u2019s one thing I remember so well. Like my older brother was ill, had some sort of a lung problem in his high school year. They took him to Budapest and the lungs had to be filled at that time, you know that was more complicated. They never scared me with all that. Or I remember my younger brother, who was four years older than Iam. He once, he lived in another town, worked also in a bank. And he must have gotten sick with some sort of a so-called blood disease where the white cells were more than the red cells or so on and I didn\u2019t quite understand the whole thing. And my parents would talk to them on the phone and I think they were worried about what was going on, but then he got well. But they never, ever shared the worry with me, so therefore I was not exposed to anything bad, ever, up to that point. You know? My parents lived together and my brother... we were... it was a close-knit family, but not a spoiled. You know, like my father had probably enough money, but I made a big deal of asking for money. I remember I would say and that they laughed about that. That\u2019s not important to the interview, but I would say, \u201cI have a real, real, real big favor to ask, and a real 10 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I mean, I made a big deal about it, you know? So up to the last moment that was the way I was brought up. My bad parts was my Catholic high school at the last year, which also was in my interview, because one of the nuns was very anti-Semitic and that hurt my feeling very much. But there again, I didn\u2019t cry. I couldn\u2019t object to it. It wasn\u2019t like nowadays, people protest. So, I had to kind of swallow it and live with it. So, I don\u2019t remember ever being very upset or that I got hurt easily, you know, like some people get hurt over everything. I had friends and they liked me and I liked them and somehow that\u2019s the way I was brought up."

From ghetto time on, it hit us. It\u2019s just like for everybody else. But you might have had interviews with some people, maybe they had a bad childhood or maybe somebody was abusive. And who knows? I didn\u2019t have any of that. It hit me at the time when the Germans came in. And I read that other places, too, people didn\u2019t imagine it could happen to you. And we never imagined that it could happen to us, whatever was happening, everything was gradual. You know, the giving up your whole place, the ghetto, the brick factory. It just... it hit you and we had to face it and I did without any, you know, any crying, temper or fighting it. The only upset points I would have, and would see again my parents sitting in front of our ghetto home, where it was raining and they had to leave their stuff. I always used to think that they had all the nice things and now you just have to leave it there. So, I always felt more sorry for them than for myself at the time. That\u2019s the way I remember."

I really realized that my parents are gone and my brothers are gone. And I have mentioned in some of the interviews how I found about what happened to my brothers, so I don\u2019t want to repeat myself to that. But everything was still completely like a dream type of a thing, because I remember that people wanted me to meet friends and get together with them. And I was just like, like blindfolded. I did what I was told. I didn\u2019t have my own personality, you know. I don\u2019t remember much about the time, you know. And I was in Budapest for a whole year before I came out to this country. And some things are fairly vivid in my mind, some people I don\u2019t even remember. I just really don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t know if I ever mentioned it, before the war they wanted me to marry somebody. Did I say that? I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s important, but there was a real good friend of ours, a family. He was a lawyer and they were rich people. And their nephew got married to a girl in my hometown, who 1s still alive now somewhere. I never see her anymore, but she lived in Israel. And that person who was marrying the girl brought his cousin. And they lived somewhere in the Yugoslavian area and they were big farmers or landlords, landholders and very rich people.

And I don\u2019t know that should be in the Holocaust Museum, but... briefly I would say it was a big dinner and I sat next to that guy and enough that he invited me to go to where he lives and meet his parents. And my mother and I took a train and we went with this guy... can\u2019t even remember his name anymore. It was beautiful. They waited for us with a sleigh. So, I liked, only thing is the sleigh rides in the snow. And at that time, of course, I knew my husband by then, because we were growing up together. We came to the United States and I liked him. And I certainly didn\u2019t like that guy. He was like about ten years older than I am. And so on the way back, on the train, I used my personality, where I might have cried, and told my mother, \u201cI absolutely don\u2019t want anything to do with this situation.\u201d And they accepted it. They didn\u2019t force me to do that. But I think I was very upset and I might have cried then. On the train home I kind of said, \u201c\u201cNo way do I want to do that.\u201d But then after the war, people wanted me to meet a friend and so on. And it\u2019s very vague in my mind. I can\u2019t remember. I love music and somebody, my husband\u2019s wife, they got married just before the war. Not my husband\u2019s, I\u2019m sorry, my brother. And she got me some opera tickets and I liked opera at the time, it\u2019s a season ticket. And I went to all that because I was told to do but I didn\u2019t have my heart in it. You know? It was just something that I was so vague and my girlfriend, and I think I might have said that. She was my good friend, who 1s still a friend of mine and I still see her all the time. She sometimes comes to the United States and I have been visiting her."

And I remember one thing, that I stood against a wall and of course, they never knew what happened to me. And I think it was very vivid in my mind and I told my story to her. Then she hired me. She gave me a job, and I worked in that place. Oh, I don\u2019t know, just help out and they taught me how to make patterns for fur coats. You know there is a way to do that. And I worked in that furrier place until it was time for me to leave Budapest to come to this country. And I might have, you remember my tape? I must have told in it that I got a letter, letters from my sister-in-laws, where they were happy that I\u2019m going to becoming a member of the family. And then I got a letter from my husband where he asked me to come out. But my Budapest time, that year and a half, I had to go back to my hometown. I had to give up my apartment. I had to sell things which were so dear to my parents and cost, must have cost a lot of money. I practically had to just give it away. It was inflation time. And so, I got rid of all that.

And at that time, he used to play the violin and I used to play the piano. And we belonged to the same music school. And we did by then, like I was teenager, maybe fourteen and he might have been 15 and a half. And we had some pieces that we played together and then there would be a recital, and we did... so those are the ways that we really... and then we played tennis together and his sister was a friend of mine, who is... in fact, she\u2019s coming August the 5\"\". She now lives in Argentina. She was one of them who had a little child and lost the child, and she\u2019s coming to visit. And then he fell in love with me more, when, you know, you\u2019re 16 or 17. And before he left, and he would ask me, he said he\u2019s going to marry me. And of course, he was only eighteen and I was sixteen and a half and he left to the United States. So, all kind of things could have happened. But I remember we went to Budapest at one time because I had to... no, he had to go after his papers, because he had an uncle in Washington, D.C., who brought him out with a student visa. And then he went to school in Washington. And so, for a while, until 1941, he would write very frequently. And like, I think I might have mentioned that for my birthday, he would ask his mother and she would send a bouquet of a hundred red roses, which at that time... she paid for it. And I think it wasn\u2019t as expensive as it is now. But then the war came in \u201841 and after that, I never heard from him. First of all, you couldn\u2019t get letters. He was in the service, in the Army, Air Force, actually. So, that was about, but we played ping pong together. I mean, Eger is a small town and the Jewish community wasn\u2019t really that big. And by then when I graduated from high school, we really didn\u2019t keep up with our non-Jewish friends that much."

And then my friend said, \u201cJust stay away, pretend that you\u2019re not interested,\u201d and then he will change being after me like that. And he did just that. So, he stayed away and then I suddenly thought to myself, well it\u2019s more than... you know, I really didn\u2019t want to stay away. So, I felt the same way toward him, but see I was younger and I went to a Catholic high school, and we had friends after that. And I had a boyfriend later, whom I really liked very much, but differently than Sandy. Because he was the kind of guy I would have never wanted to marry. And he flirted with one girl and then with another and then with a third one.

I think I mentioned that he went to Bergen-Belsen to get his sisters. And he took them to Casablanca, because he was stationed in Casablanca at that time. And then he wanted to have the girls come to the United States, which didn\u2019t work out, because one went back to Hungary. The other one stayed and married somebody there. But he kind of thought that I could come out and we all could live together. We would get married. If it works, fine. If it doesn\u2019t, we could always separate.

            "answer": "Well, the first thing, for example, was tremendously strange, but I do remember that we had help in our house, when I was growing up, and my mother tried to make me once in a while to, to help a little bit. I think she wanted to train me to become eventually a good housewife. I think all mothers like to do that. And I remember that one day she was making me dust the furniture in the bedroom, although all my friends were downstairs already, down on the main street walking. And I kept on looking out and I was just upset that I couldn\u2019t be there. I could have done dusting the furniture in two seconds, but instead of that, I was fooling around and I wished I would be down with my friends. So anyway, I was procrastinating that kind of stuff apparently, like many other kids, I didn\u2019t want to maybe do what my chore would have been. After I came back and I had that big apartment, and I remember I worked like a dog. You know, we had hardwood floors. And at that time, you know, you didn\u2019t have the kind of waxers and the facilities and the vacuum cleaners like they have them now. I remember I had a brush I put on the one foot and I waxed the floor. And under your other foot, you have a rag. I mean, you never saw anything like that, but..."

And that was very hard for me too, as I mentioned, because I couldn\u2019t speak the language. And they were friendly and nice with me, but when you can\u2019t communicate... I mean, everything 1s so strange when you are at a new place. But what I must say now, and I don\u2019t know if I ever said it. That I still, at this moment, I have this kind of a feeling that I compare things to the 1944 situation. And I always used to think that\u2019s very hard, but how much better it is than it was then. So, everything in all my life, since then, I compare it to, lots of times. That if I was able to take that, my God, I should be able to take this. It wasn\u2019t that easy, but he, after school he would come over and then we would go out. Then we would try, 1t wasn\u2019t that easy, because ten years went by, but we knew we were getting married, and it was... you had to adjust to that, too. Plus I don\u2019t think I talked too much about my experiences then. And he loved music and we talked about music, so on, and then we had a very small wedding and I must have told that to Mary K. And so, it was just something that I could adjust to things, easier I think than maybe many other people. And if something 1s a hardship or like, you could say, \u201cMy God you haven\u2019t been with him for a long time, that must have been hard.\u201d Must have been hard to be in a home, a nice home in Washington, D.C. with an American woman and a Hungarian man, but who has been in this country since age 14, children who wanted to be nice to me, but it\u2019s hard. And it was hard, but I adjusted to that too. And I mean I didn\u2019t suffer, because I thought this is for, toward the better. And I always compared things like that, even as of today, I put things on a scale in my mind, and how would it be better, you know? And so I adjust to things easier, I think. See I don\u2019t know whether I told Mary K. about my Bloomington experiences or did we talk about that? 17 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

            "answer": "Okay, well my uncle in Budapest gave me a lovely, nice black patent leather, little overnight case with red leather lining. And anything what I had valuable which people gave me, maybe jewelry and I can\u2019t remember, as presents or Sandy\u2019s sister has given me certain things from her mom, was in that. And I held onto it in Paris. I took care of all my belongings. And when we arrived in New York and a second uncle of Sandy and his son, waited for me and came with us to the railroad station. And by then I felt I don\u2019t have to watch that much anymore. I think I just didn\u2019t take care of my things as much. And when they were putting the things into the cab... I didn\u2019t have that much belonging, but that little black suitcase was missing. So somebody as we were talking right next to the, on the railroad station waiting for a cab to come, must have picked it up and they stole it. And that disappointed me tremendously, because I thought this country 1s very safe. Things like that, it would not happen. Because Sandy always used to write to me that they put a 25 cents down near the newspaper and nobody takes that 25 cents and you can just get your paper. So, I thought no crime is happening in this country. And that was one of my disappointments. The other one was the Ellis Island and I had to be there. And he also wrote to me that the uncle had a black, they had a black maid. And he said to me that, you know, you gotta be, if you are going to meet her... because I\u2019ve never seen black people. And he just kind of tried to make me realize that, well, we were very liberal, in all this, in our upbringing, and Sandy was too, that you got to be very nice and not make difference between a black and a white. And then when I met her, of course, she was very nice, but that was the first time I ever seen a black person, but I was already warned by Sandy that you got to be very nice. They\u2019re just like whites and they can\u2019t help that they\u2019re persecuted and stuff like that. So, I was prepared for all that. And I tell you, in this country, in Louisville, Kentucky, I was terribly disappointed at one time. I met a young couple, Jewish couple, who invited us to their house. And I don\u2019t know where they are now and they seemed like they were prejudiced against blacks from their talk. And I couldn\u2019t believe it. I could not understand it as of today, and I know there are very many Jewish people who are prejudiced towards blacks. Now, I know. I couldn\u2019t believe that anybody who 1s persecuted themselves, how can they be prejudiced towards somebody else. And that was another disappointment in my life that I couldn\u2019t understand that."

Then the middle part was just a little sink, a tiny, little sink and some sort of a cooking facility, tiny. And the third part of it was, it was kind of those round top of the trailers. The campus, I heard, bought them all from somewhere for a dollar apiece. And we paid 25 dollars for that. The third part was just big enough for a little crib, so I don\u2019t think it was as big as this. Might have been half of the size. I was very... I accepted that, too. And you know, I used to think, well now I\u2019m free and I\u2019m not in Auschwitz. Some people wouldn\u2019t have lived like that, they rented an apartment maybe, housing place. Then they complained all the time that the landlady told them that they use too much water and they have the lights on too long.

And Sandy was making, getting some kind of a, you know he was on the G.I. Bill. And then in graduate school he did some sort of a little extra work. So, the G.I. Bill paid his tuition. Maybe he got a hundred twenty-five dollars or whatever, 150 dollars a month. So the 25 dollars was for rent and then we lived on the rest of it. (Laughing.)

And somehow it didn\u2019t remind him of anything he remembered. And that turned him off somehow. I mean, maybe shouldn\u2019t have, but it did. So some people could be considered very religious and they keep it up. He didn\u2019t. When I came out to this country, we did not belong to anything, at all. And I somehow didn\u2019t miss it, but when my kids were getting to be Sunday school age, and that was already in Louisville, Kentucky, then we did join a synagogue at the time."

You know, it was just so strange to me and of course everything was in English and very little in Hebrew. But we belonged there and I went to the holidays and took the kids. But since we did not observe it, the way some, and I don\u2019t know how religious your family is, so I\u2019m not comparing myself to anybody else. I\u2019m just telling it to you. Therefore I didn\u2019t expect my children to become that religious either. I took them to Sunday school, because I felt like they should have that background. But the Sunday schools at that time, at least where we belonged, was not anything that I would think desirable. The teachers were just volunteer people. The discipline was not very good. The kids could do anything they wanted to and if they left Sunday school and they walked over to an ice cream place and they came back. I would hear stories like that. And that disappointed me, because it didn\u2019t leave any impression on them. Now, the Sunday schools now that, let me see, my daughter, Linda, is married to a Jewish guy. And they do belong and I do too, now, to Temple Shalom, which is actually one branch of the B\u2019rith Sholom, which long time ago closed up. And Adath Israel and B\u2019rith Sholom merged and it became the Temple, which is a big and fancy one and a lot of rich people belong there. And the Temple Shalom is a lot more Reformed and we do like our rabbi very much. And I go on High Holy days. I don\u2019t go that often, but he\u2019s a real nice guy. And Linda\u2019s kids go to Sunday school. And the teachers are nice. They learn a lot more and they like to go. My kids didn\u2019t like to go, because they just didn\u2019t get anything out of it. And I\u2019m sorry about that, but that\u2019s the way it was. Now, my son- 22 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And I felt like I wanted to join. Sandy wouldn\u2019t have cared either way. I said, now in my older age, I kind of felt like... because I\u2019m not so religious, but I have my, a traditional background, which you can never ever get out of your system. So, it\u2019s not the same as the way I remember the high holidays in Europe. Everything was in Hebrew and I remember on Yom Kippur, I would go and visit my family while they were sitting, all day long at the synagogue. We were not Orthodox. We didn\u2019t keep kosher, so... and I like that. Because I knew a lot of religious people who... like in Sandy\u2019s family maybe they didn\u2019t eat in their home, but they would go out and eat stuff that they really shouldn\u2019t. Or Mark\u2019s family in Brooklyn, they were very religious. They kept kosher. When they come to visit to Louisville, we would go out for dinner and absolutely never failed that the father would not order maybe bacon or ham or that kind of thing. And I felt like that\u2019s kind of, you know, it\u2019s not really true. Either you keep it or you don\u2019t keep it. They were very nice people. They\u2019re both dead now and I liked them very much. But my family wasn\u2019t like that. We ate anything and we weren\u2019t... and I kind of like that. I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re religious or not, very religious or not."

And his pay was a little bit more, but not very much and I had two kids by then. And many of the wives of the people who were there on internship, did some work at night. And I wanted to do some work myself. And there was a glass factory, the Forbes. They manufactured all kinds of bottles, just beer bottles, little bottles and so on. And I got a job there.

And I was sick one time with strep throat. And Sandy got a call somewhere about some pay raise, something. And he got so excited and he was doing the laundry. And we had some sort of washing machine that you had to stop it in between all the periods. And suddenly the water overflowed and the water was coming all over the whole National home, you know, it\u2019s... I don\u2019t know if you know what they are like.

And I learned, actually practiced, how to drive at the VA, because it was just a nice big campus that no traffic. But my real experience for learning how to drive was still in Bloomington, Indiana. For five dollars, we got like a course, and I learned how to drive, but since we didn\u2019t have a car, I couldn\u2019t practice it. So, in Marion we did have a car and I practiced how to drive.

            "answer": "So then we... how did we get to Louisville, your question was. A friend of Sandy\u2019s heard about a job and he was offered that job. It was a post-doctoral fellowship at the Child Guidance Clinic here in Louisville. And his name was Fred Kanfer and he was more an experimental psychologist, not a clinical psychologist. And he did not want the job and he mentioned it to Sandy. And so he came to Louisville and he applied for it. And he got that job at the Child Guidance Clinic, which was for one year only. And that was kind of very nice. We lived in an apartment in the South end, it\u2019s where I met the person, who I first felt like, she still must like me, even so that she found out that I was Jewish. Now that was many years later. And the people at the Child Guidance Clinic were very, very nice. They are all older social workers or psychiatrists or psychologists. They practically took us in like a family. They had lot of family get-togethers. And we didn\u2019t go out otherwise. Because then my daughter was born, Linda was born, in 1954. So we moved to Louisville in \u201853 and we still lived in the South end when she was born. And our assignment was only for one year. And now my story is really important here, but I couldn\u2019t see myself moving in September when she was supposed to born in September. And we didn\u2019t have much money because that pay was, you know, quite little. And our apartment at the Washington Park apartments was already then eighty-two dollars and ninety-five cents or so. We had to pay utilities, too. So I told Sandy just anything he could do. And by then I could walk to the grocery, because it was right behind our apartments. I could walk, we had one car, I could walk to the pediatrician. And I never did anything else, like go to town or do that kind of stuff. And I said, \u201cI wish we could stay just at least maybe for one more year, so we don\u2019t have to move just exactly in September.\u201d Because they usually would have seminars and then people would go to those seminars and then people come with job opportunities. So Sandy would have had to go to one of those things and find a job. And we would have had to move. Well, it was very, very hard even for me to imagine and so, the Child Guidance Clinic gave him a part time job. And at Norton he worked part time and in one other hospital it was part time. I mean, just very little, here and there. Then he met two psychiatrists, who needed somebody and they became our friends, too. And they needed somebody who would do some testing for them. And they offered him to try and see if he would like that. And he tried it and they offered him a nice salary and that\u2019s how we stayed in Louisville. He worked with them for a long time. And those psychiatrists are still alive and they are very nice people. We\u2019re still friends. And Linda was born in \u201854, so I didn\u2019t have to move away. And then we stayed in the apartments until 1957. And we were looking for a house and we found this and we have been here ever since."

I was very busy with the kids. And I didn\u2019t even watch, well we didn\u2019t have any television at that time, I remember. It was later. And when you get busy, I spend a lot more time now, listening to the news and being involved. But I was a very conscientious mother and there was just a lot to do. By then I had three kids and you know, diapers and just... I was very, very busy. And since Sandy worked, day and very many times in the evening, he wasn\u2019t really that much of a help. He couldn\u2019t. In summertime we would go one vacation, we did every year. Because his uncle in Washington had a summer home in Annapolis, Maryland and he offered for us to go there. So, we would leave in the evening and drive all night to get to Annapolis by next day. And we would spend two weeks there, which was again, some mothers might have been complaining about it, but I did not. It wasn\u2019t really that easy on me, because, you know, I did the cooking and it wasn\u2019t a luxury. But the kids had a good time, you know, Sandy would take them out and they would fish and maybe they go on a boat ride. But Linda was still a baby, so I was really more like a mom over there, than it was a really exciting vacation. So, we had done that for many years, till my youngest one was two years old, and then they sold that place. But no, I did not remember anything that I was that worried about that. And when we come to schools maybe, you might like to... and I will have a really important story, too, about my oldest son, Andy, who... the school was nearby us here, where we live even now.

And he was in fourth grade when we moved here. And my youngest daughter, I mean Elizabeth was two years younger, so she went to kindergarten over there.

They went to Belknap Elementary School. And then to, and Andy finished here. He was in sixth grade. And he met some really nice friends on our street. Then they went to Highland Junior High School. Now, the friend, who we met here and became friendly with Andy was two years older. Non-Jewish people, he was very liberal type. And he started a club. I don\u2019t know how much you know about social clubs. We belonged to the Jewish Community Center, too. Sandy was pretty against those things, but he always said, I wish they would ask them and I wish they could refuse it, meaning, you know... because he had problems, you know, as a child psychologist with kids, they\u2019re so upset and depressed over that they were not included in one of those clubs. And those social clubs were horrible things, but they existed. So, my kids were invited to it, but they weren\u2019t terribly active at the Jewish Community Center. For example, they had those, it\u2019s really not important to even talk about. But Andy\u2019s friend started a new club. It was called the Princeton. And there was no question that blacks should not be a part of it or Jews should not be part of it, he was that kind of a kid."

And I didn\u2019t expect to have another something like this to happen. But I handled that pretty well, too. But I remember when the telephone calls were done and my friend\u2019s wife offered that she\u2019ll come with me to Appleton. And I said, well maybe that\u2019s not necessary. We left John Bell, Dr. Bell 1s the psychiatrist who reached Sandy at the Atlanta airport and he turned right back around on the airplane. So my friend, his wife, took me to the airport and we felt if he will be on that plane that we were supposed to be taking, then Nancy would not come with me. In the meantime, I had to leave my six year old son, Linda was ten and Elizabeth was twelve. But at that time, Sandy has a sister, whose daughter just graduated from high school, who was Andy\u2019s age. And she came to stay with us for a whole year. And that was the year that she was staying here, from Buenos Aires, Argentina. And she had a hard time to adjust, too. She was very homesick. But at that time she already decided she\u2019s staying. Now, she was a, she was, she liked to cook, and she was... well, I had a help in the house too, not all the time, but a couple times a week. So, I just packed my stuff. I remember the kids all standing next to me. And I thought about cold weather and warm weather and I packed my suitcase. And with her, with Kathy being here, who is 18. No, I\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth was sixteen and Linda was twelve and Robert was six. So, anyway, I said, \u201cI just have to leave.\u201d And I was hoping that everything will turn out okay. And I\u2019m still seeing the kids standing there, they were, you know, of course terribly worried. And I went to the airport. Sandy was on that plane coming back from Atlanta and we flew to Appleton, Wisconsin. It was in the middle of the night. We didn\u2019t know what we were going to find. And it was, you know, really heartbreaking in a way, and we... somebody took us into the hospital and Andy was under all kind of wires. And he was in a coma actually for about three days, completely out of it. And Sandy stayed with me until he was coming to, and... not that he was better, but he was not in a coma anymore. And one very important story I must tell you. The day we arrived, of course there was an article in that, in the Appleton paper. And somebody called the hospital and wanted to meet the parents of this young boy. And that was a Catholic family, a mother and a father, who had also four children, but they were already older and out of the house. And they came to the hospital and not even knowing me or Sandy, they offered their house. They lived pretty close to the hospital. That I could stay with them. And they were wonderful. And now see, something like that makes me cry. I was there for six weeks and I could walk from the hospital to their home. The kids were out of her house already, so she had a place. I could talk to somebody at night about how things are going. And otherwise I spent the whole day in the hospital. See the result of all this was, that eventually, I mean, his spinal cord was injured and he became a paraplegic. But we didn\u2019t know that for a long time, you know. I don\u2019t know if you know anybody, when people are this sick, that for example they have movements in their leg, which is just nothing. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. But sometimes I would talk to them on the phone all the time. See Sandy stayed for a little while and then he went back home. So, I talked to them on the phone all the time and 28 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I thought now when Andy died, then maybe I will throw it away. I can not. I have letters and letters and letters people wrote to me, to the hospital. And I still have them. In fact, just a little while ago, I re-read them. I never, never could open those letters until just recently. And they were helping with the kids and they were bringing food for them and you know, they were... the kids were wonderful. They were behaving very nicely. And so, I was there for six weeks. At Christmas time or holiday time, they came, all of them, to Appleton. And that\u2019s the only time we stayed in a hotel, because this family, named Alice and Art, children came home for the holidays and there was not enough room. But that made it so much easier for me. And of course, I couldn\u2019t sleep well and I got some tranquilizers from this psychiatrist doctor. Which even maybe even two pills couldn\u2019t make me relax enough. But I there again was... I don\u2019t think I cried. I was under tremendous tension all the time, and not knowing what the outcome will be. Appleton was finished. Finally we decided that we can bring him home. So, with an ambulance we brought him home to Louisville. And of course, he couldn\u2019t sit up or anything like that. I mean, it was... he was paralyzed from waist down. But at that time he wasn\u2019t absolutely sure about it, but they gave him a final test. And the final test showed that the spinal cord was completely severed, so injured, and that doesn\u2019t look like, you know, it can be ever... but making the story short, we put him here in Louisville, into a hospital, which at that time was the St. Anthony Hospital. We had a friend who was that kind of doctor who dealt with this kind of injuries, except... he was a wonderful man, he was a friend, but he didn\u2019t know enough about the whole deal. Because I remember we were very disappointed. The hospital, like the orderly put him, in the bathroom, put him on the toilet and left him there. I mean his back was... he shouldn\u2019t have done that. He was there for six weeks and at the very end, our friend, the psychiatrist, made arrangements at the Rusk Institute in New York City. That they can transfer him there. Which they did, and just very briefly, before they left, a nurse offered, private nurse will stay with us for the weekend, before Andy goes, because Andy wanted to come home for the weekend. Well, that woman was absolutely, she should have never been a nurse. She tried to show, she said that she had a daughter who had polio and that daughter of hers walked after a while. She kept on telling Andy, if you have faith, you will be walking again. Well, she should have never said that. And then we were over here in that weekend in my house. She made him, with crutches and braces, stand above behind the wheelchair. And Kathy, who 1s a big, heavyset girl, sat in the wheelchair. And he wanted to prove something, that how much he advanced. Well, with the braces, he couldn\u2019t walk, but she made him stand up. So, then he sat in a chair in the living room and he says, \u201cBoy that feels good.\u201d And the nurse says, \u201cMaybe it feels good for you, but it\u2019s not... maybe it feels good, but it\u2019s not good for you.\u201d And Andy says, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not good for me, but it still feels good.\u201d And the woman got so angry, that came out to the kitchen and says, \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d And I went out to the kitchen... yes, I did cry then. I gave her the check, what I owed her. And I couldn\u2019t believe it, he was sitting in that chair upstairs. And Sandy calls home, \u201cHow is everything going?\u201d And I says, whatever the nurse\u2019s name was, she left. \u201cI\u2019ll be right home.\u201d So, he came home and we had some real good friends, who are still our friends. He used to be our family doctor and his wife, and Doctor Eskind and his wife came over because they knew Andy\u2019s going to leave. And they wanted to say good-bye to him. And Andy\u2019s sitting in the chair. I tell them the whole story. They couldn\u2019t believe it. And finally Sandy and Harold Eskind help him down... we have all those steps... helped him down to the bedroom. And Harold says, \u201cPll come over tomorrow morning.\u201d See she was supposed to be here and help us getting him ready. I mean, you know, with a paraplegic, it takes a long time to do that. And 29 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We\u2019ll just get up an hour earlier,\u201d or whatever. And Robert that night, who was only six, slept in the TV room right opposite of our bedroom. I mean, he was upset and he was worried. And he woke up with a hundred and four fever. And so, as I said, loud, I said, \u201c\u201cGod, we sure could use Doctor Eskind now. And as I said that, apparently our living room was open and he did come anyway. And he was walking in and he says, \u201cHere Iam.\u201d That was, you know, like an angel coming from heaven. He helped us get, he helped us getting Andy ready. He gave Robert a shot, I think, whatever he needed. I didn\u2019t go with them. It was only Sandy and Andy who flew to... the Ruskin Institute did marvels. He was there for six weeks. Luckily his mind was completely well. They taught him how to drive. They taught him how to get dressed. They taught him complete independency. And Andy used to be a very stubborn kid as a young person. When he wanted to do something, he wanted to do it right then. And that helped him tremendously in his accident. Of course, he decided and I have a beautiful paper, which he wrote, then later he... I don\u2019t want to jump ahead of myself, but he learned how to do all this. He got acar. It had a hand control. And he was home the first year. He used to have a girlfriend from Myrtle Beach from before his accident. He says he wants to visit her. And we begged him, it\u2019s too early, yet. I mean he... all by himself to go to North Carolina or wherever the girl lived. He says, \u201cIf I would know that I\u2019m going to walk next year, I would wait, but since I know I\u2019m not going to, I want to do it right now.\u201d _He got in the car, he drove over there. I said, \u201cPlease call us the minute you get there.\u201d He did. So, anyway he was really unbelievably... you know, I still say that. Then he went back to Lawrence, he went back to Lawrence University for a semester. And he did very well, but it got very cold there in Wisconsin and the snow was so high, that he couldn\u2019t even get out of his dormitory to get to the, like to the classes. So, Sandy sent somebody, a young man, who moved him back and he was transferred to Houston, Texas. To the University where the climate is different. So, he went back there and he finished college in three and a half years, instead of four. I mean, he made up. And in summer time, he went to Chapel Hill, North Carolina and spent summer school there. And one summer he went to Boston, to Harvard, just for a semester. So, he made up all his lost time. He finished and then he moved out to California. He was very independent. He did everything on his own. And in the beginning, he didn\u2019t really want to come back that much. I think the memories and all that. For example, he was fighting that we shouldn\u2019t put an elevator in the house. He didn\u2019t want us to move and we didn\u2019t. We tried to put an elevator in, but with this split-level it wasn\u2019t that easy. And when he would come home, he was so matter of fact of anybody who wanted to help him, lift him up. I mean, he got used to the idea. Then he decided he\u2019s going to go to Social Work school. And he applied to Kent Social Work School (ph) and that\u2019s when he wrote... I could give you that, I mean just for your own fun. When he applied to the school, he wrote a beautiful paper, which now after he died, Sandy made a bunch of copies of them. And just since you\u2019re interested and all, I give you a copy of that and also a newspaper clipping after he died. He got interested in California and don\u2019t ask me why, with a Lyndon LaRouche political group. I don\u2019t know if you ever heard of him or not. But he met tremendous amount and good friends through all those years, who became so close to him, that in the beginning, I wondered what they are like. But then later on we met them. They became, besides the political adventures, they were interested in poetry. And Andy also loved music, became more and more so. He had a selection of CD\u2019s bigger than we have. And he, first they lived in San Francisco, then they moved to Livermore, California and I visited him there. I met some of those people. And then they moved to Los Angeles and I was there. Now just a year and a half 30 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

The doctor recommended him, that if he wouldn\u2019t do it, then eventually his kidneys would become infected by it. He decided, we asked a lot of informations whether is that a good thing to do. And everybody recommended. And I went to Los Angeles. I stayed with him for three and a half weeks, while he had the surgery. When... Sandy and I went together and then after Sandy had to leave and I stayed. And the people were very, very nice. They gave a big party. And they were singing and they read poetry before he went into the hospital. Then after that they kept on coming all the time. They enlarged the bladder, took a part of the intestine and made the bladder bigger. So, anyway, that was the... whatever they had to do. . In fact, both of his doctors were Jewish, just so happened that from the name I could tell. Nice, nice people, very nice. And he was in a hospital in Los Angeles, in a Mexican, you know, there were a lot of Mexican and Spanish speaking people there. And I worried a little bit, because he didn\u2019t have to pay a penny. It was, you know he was... since he was a handicapped person, he had all the facilities there, which were paid. And they were wonderful. So, I was pleased with that. He recuperated. We went home and he worried that his appetite is not as good as it used to be. I said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I mean, they messed up your stomach. You\u2019ll be all right.\u201d So, my big job was cooking for him, plus showing him the CD\u2019s, which one he wants first. And we played all day long. The people he lived with, he had two roommates. Andy never got married, two guys. They were very nice. Then I came home. Then I have never seen him afterwards, but he was all right. He was going to come back. And one day, on a Sunday, January 24\", I get a phone call from his roommate. And Chuck says, \u201cI have very sad news for you.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat?\u201d I thought he might have gotten sick again and then I would have gone out to be with him. Well, he died in his sleep. He didn\u2019t wake up. It was a Sunday morning, from Saturday to Sunday. Saturday night, he was in the office and they were doing some kind of an experiment. They were really bright, intelligent people. How they got involved with Lyndon LaRouche... End of Tape 2, Side B 31 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

                " And I dealt with it, but I remember when I got this news I couldn\u2019t believe it. And I still right now, when I say to you that Auschwitz seems like a dream and it wasn\u2019t me. Sometimes I think of this and I said, \u201cIs it really true that he\u2019s no longer alive?\u201d But then again, I measure certain things. We used to worry, what will happen to Andy when we die, and this group falls apart? My daughter, Linda, she\u2019s a nurse and she says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I'll take care of him.\u201d Well, Andy didn\u2019t like to be taken care of. He could do everything in the world on his own. Anything. Driving, shopping. I mean you wouldn\u2019t believe it, if I give you something about this, you wouldn\u2019t believe it. Like we have a friend here, who took him on a Sierra weekend, canoe trip. And in the mud, she pushed the wheelchair and he would get into the canoe. I mean, there was nothing that he would not want to do. He was just brave. And when I got this note, I mean I couldn\u2019t believe it. And we didn\u2019t know quite what to do. We had Sandy\u2019s sister here from Hungary for three months, who was eighty-four years old. She took this very hard, plus she was too old to travel. So, my youngest son, Robert, offered that he\u2019ll come with me to Los Angeles. And we flew over there a week later. That was the end of, it was January 31\u201c that they had a memorial service for him. And it was really very, very nice. When I went into that room... and I know Jewish funerals, well that wasn\u2019t a funeral, just a memorial. They had some flowers. They had a big poster of Andy. He was very involved with... he loved Shakespeare, and they were very intellectual, but at the same time they were just nice, nice people. And we had a lovely... the whole memorial service lasted for three and half hours and about 11:30, well everybody decided, it\u2019s time to quit. But there were speeches and people were sending letters and all the letters were, some people read poems. The day when this happened, in Andy\u2019s house, they were meeting for a poetry reading group, at 11 o\u2019clock, every Sunday. And Andy didn\u2019t get up on time, so they were kind of thinking that he went to bed late, maybe he just didn\u2019t wake up. But they... and they wondered why, but they weren\u2019t going to wake him up. And later on, a few hours later, when he still wasn\u2019t up, Chuck opened his door and he was in bed, asleep. And he had died maybe about maybe three, four o\u2019clock. So, he did not take good care of his eating habits, I think. He loved all the things which are really not that good for you, butter and salami. He exercised, but only in the wheelchair, naturally. And he just, it had to be a, it was his heart, you know, like he must have had clogged-up arteries. Although when he had that surgery, they checked him out and he was okay then. I mean, there were no problems, but that was a year and a half later. And that\u2019s really what happened. Now you can ask me all kinds of questions. "

Because no matter how he accepted it and he was great by it. And I will give you that, I really will give you, because you seem interested in it. The way his friends talked about it all. That he never married. If he would have been old in the wheelchair, he would have needed help, you know. Those people were his friends, but they were not the family. If we would have died, we would have wondered. So, I used to think about that, what will happen to him. And he lived on the absolute minimum, you know? Like my youngest son, Robert, he has a big house, he has a boat. And he\u2019s an administer, I mean a hospital administer, administrator. Andy, nothing, he didn\u2019t, you know he was in the 1960s. When the Civil Rights movement was... he was paralyzed... from Texas, he took a bus to Washington, D.C. when they had the march. And in the bus, his toes got burned, because his foot was close to the heater and he could never feel it.

Linda and Mark, my daughter and husband came over, and I said, I would like our rabbi to know this. And Mark called, his name is Stanley Miles.

And the rabbi was very nice, talked about us, talked about Andy, as much as he learned from us. He met him, actually, once, because my grandson had a Bar Mitzvah two years ago. He\u2019s now 15, when he was 13 years old. And Andy came for that. And then the rabbi asked him to read something at that occasion. So, he met him.

The first time a friend wanted to take me to the house where I was living up to the age 12. It\u2019s... the houses in Europe are closed up, you know, the big doors and you can\u2019t see inside. So, that person rang the doorbell and I was very reluctant to do this. And somebody came to the door and he says, \u201cWell this young lady lived in this house long time ago.\u201d They took me in. Of course, nothing was the way it was at the time, because in the meantime there was a war. There were chicken and pigs, you know like. We had flower gardens then. But what I appreciated, they wanted to know if I wanted to go inside and I said, \u201cNo thank you.\u201d I really didn\u2019t want to go back, because it was just, I remember those years so much and I just didn\u2019t want to. And during the communism, you know, they divided the house. That was a big house, so that house was divided into about three or four different sections. I didn\u2019t want to go in. And then the next time... that was in \u201871. Of course it, I mean the first time, it was really hard. I didn\u2019t want to run into anybody who I used to know from olden time, but luckily they died. You know like, I would have never wanted to run into a police official person, who was in charge of making us go to the ghetto. The Germans gave them the orders, but somebody had to carry it through. Well, I never, never ran into them. I never saw anybody. Old friends of ours, who we really liked, we kept in touch with. And we had a very, very, very good friend... this year was really hard for us, not only that Andy died. And we had a real good friend in Hungary, who was from our hometown, who was a musicologist. And all our trips we took in the last few years... we were in Spain and in Italy and in Sicily and in Greece, several times. We did that with that couple. He was a few years younger. His name was George Kroo and we loved him and his wife and he loved us. And one day I got a phone call from his daughter that his father died, he had a heart attack, at work. So Sandy went to Hungary to his funeral. He was married to a non-Jewish girl, but we loved them dearly. So, I never even want to go on any trips. And we had another good friend in Washington, D.C., who was George\u2019s friend, our friend, he just died. And had cancer.

Some people can go to a grave. In fact, when Andy died, they cremated his body and it came back. And there was a question, how and where? There is a beautiful cemetery here, it\u2019s Cave Hill Cemetery. And I didn\u2019t know that Jewish people can be buried there. But it\u2019s a beautiful place. In Spring it is beautiful, in Fall it\u2019s beautiful. There is a lake, a lot of sculptures all over. And it\u2019s just that people come and visit without visiting any graves. And I\u2019ve heard that Temple Shalom has a lot. When I heard that, I figured, well Jews must be... and then I had some friends whose husbands are buried there. And we decided we\u2019re going to do that. And Rabbi Miles... Robert by then wasn\u2019t home, but my daughter, Elizabeth was here. And we went out to the cemetery and we did a private funeral for him with Rabbi Miles. Then at that time he didn\u2019t have a marker yet, but then several months later, not several months, maybe a couple of months later, I got a call from them. By the way, the girl who is in charge of that cemetery, has been working there for twenty-five years and she is Jewish. She knew Rabbi Miles very much. She was very, very nice and helpful. And we ordered a marker and that\u2019s there. Now, in fact, when Robert was home at Fourth of July weekend, we went out there, and he looked at it. And I\u2019m sure... my daughter is coming tomorrow for just ten days and we will go out and I took a picture of that marker. It says, Andrew Allen Klein, above it \u201cAndy\u201d and the date that he was born and the day that he died and there is a little menorah. 35 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And then there is no place for it.\u201d\u201d, And she just thought she\u2019d mention. I kept on thinking and thinking. And Sandy\u2019s sister was here at the time from Hungary. And I said to her, \u201cYou know I really would...\u201d I thought about it a lot. When we die, Linda and will the family just throw our ashes... I thought about this, but I never made a big deal about it. So I said to Sandy one day, \u201cYou know, I wouldn\u2019t mind to get two lots next to Andy\u2019s.\u201d And he didn\u2019t object to it and we did that. So we have him and then two empty lots, which we paid for. And we, of course, would like to be cremated. I mean a long time ago, I decided.

There were a bunch of people on the train, young students. And it did come up that I was there. And they asked me questions, but it 36 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I didn\u2019t cry there. It just was so manicured and it looked so different. And we were in Austria, last summer, with an elder hostel group and there were hardly any Jews in that group. But they had planned to go to Mauthausen. And we did that. And I saw there the gas chambers. Well of... it\u2019s hard for me to explain it. It\u2019s almost like that\u2019s not me. You know, it\u2019s almost like I couldn\u2019t have been there. I mean I know I was, but I just, that\u2019s the way, maybe, it\u2019s easier for me to deal with it. I just can\u2019t imagine how anybody can go through it and then be here to talk about it. And I\u2019m not the only one, a lot of people who... and it was, you know, the barracks, I peeked into some of the barracks. But, you know, I mean, it was so much worse than when I was there. I mean when I was there it was so horrible, that any of this thing now, which is a museum, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s hard to imagine that people really were there. But that was at the Dachau camp, where I went in. Some people, German people were sitting next to the entrance, in their houses with flowers and all. And I would walk by them and they looked maybe old. And I used to think at that time, I wonder what they knew. How much they knew? Did they know what\u2019s going on in that camp? Stuff like that goes through my mind all the time, even now. And Sandy gets very... if he runs into somebody who\u2019s old and maybe it would be a German, then he would never trust them. He would think he might have been a Nazi or whatever, you know. So, you never can get that out of your system. But slowly we are getting older and not that many people... and that\u2019s why I talk to many schools about this. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this, too. That I think there ought to be a way of people to know what happened really, after we die. Because there are not that many people left who survived it, slowly. I\u2019m seventy-seven years old and young people were killed. I\u2019m not saying in Theresienstadt or some of those places, because families were together. And a young person might live to be 90, and still... but in Auschwitz there were no kids, not one."

So, years and years ago, we would walk for maybe 45 minutes and one of my friends, not Jewish, asked me if I would talk about it. So, I said, \u201cPll be glad to,\u201d and for many, many weeks that we would walk, we stopped at a certain point and then they wanted to know the rest of it. So, by now it doesn\u2019t give me any problems to talk about it. When some of the schools ask me, I did. I couldn\u2019t begin to tell you now how many times I did speak in schools. Once at the Catherine Spalding College, once at St. Andrews Church and mainly then on Jewish situations, of course. And they might have a Jewish student there or not.

And they prepare the kids, most of them. They had Holocaust pictures on the wall. They were studying it before they asked me. So they were somewhat, and then they would ask a lot of questions. And I did it once at Highland Junior High School. There were 150 kids in the group and all 150 wrote me a thank you note about it. And I have all that. I have a box this full of all that kind of thing. They, one black kid, for example, said, \u201cCan I touch you?\u201d I said, \u201cYes you can.\u201d And he said, \u201cAt least if somebody would say sometimes that the Holocaust did not exist, because we talked about that, at least I can say yes it did. Because I touched somebody who was part of it.\u201d So, it made me feel good that they were thinking about that. And they hear once in a while stories where people don\u2019t want to believe. And that\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m doing it, because it would very much bother me. And then, you know, I was very affected by this Yugoslavia problems, too, with this Kosovo deal. Because it was so similar to what we have gone through. And there were... there again, and I don\u2019t know how you feel about it, some people who hate our president and hate the Democrats, would be very much against that he started this bombing and he started invading and going in. I had very mixed feelings toward the end, when the bombs kept on falling and maybe innocent people were killed. That bothered me, but at the same time, I thought to myself, if anybody would have tried to do and stopped at least part of it. They would have bombed, let\u2019s see, the railroad tracks, when the train was going to Auschwitz. Not necessarily mine, but hundreds and hundreds of them. It could have maybe stopped something. And nobody did anything. And therefore, because I feel that way so strongly, I was saying that they did the right thing. Although it\u2019s a very complicated situation and it\u2019s never going to be peace in that part of the world. And even my friend, Ilus, we talked on the phone once and she was upset\u2014now that surprised me\u2014over the bombing. And she was not, she didn\u2019t feel like I do."
