And I don\u2122t even believe we worked in the kitchen together, but towards, during the Death March, we ran into each other. She was older than I am. She used to be a seamstress. And in my stories, I think it\u2122s me ntioned that on some of the trai n rides, after we were already liberated, we were together. And I do know what happened to her. And she lives, she remarried. She had a husband earlier and then she remarried and they, to my surprise, they lived in Berlin. And he died in the meantime. I think he was an artist. And although I never thought I want to go back to Germany, but at one point, with some friends from here, we did a two weeks tour in Germany, which took us to Berli n, too. And my, another friend w ho knew of her, gave me her address and phone number. And I wrote to her and she came over to see, visit me in the hotel. That\u2122s the first time I have seen her after Auschw itz times. And she still lives in Berlin. She\u2122s much older than I am, so at times I\u2122ve heard that she\u2122s kind of ill. So, I don\u2122t know what she\u2122s doing.

I never kept up with anybody else. I don\u2122t know what happened to them. But I agree with you that I did talk about five girls a lot together, but they were not from my hometown.

And then what has happened, that after that people were separated a lot, transports were leaving, and my husband\u2122s two sisters were in Auschwitz, but they were taken away to Germany. And they wo rked like, the so-called forced labor, now in factories or whatever. But then we came so cl ose and when people were separated from their so-called loved ones, of course our parents were gone, but we didn\u2122t know exactly what happened to them. We somehow decided that we just never wa nt to separate from each other. And we did become good friends to the last mi nute. And I told you that, maybe, or I might have said it in the video, that my husband thinks that maybe I su rvived because of her and she thinks maybe because of me. But she was a bright girl a nd lot more outgoing or spoke lot of languages and 1 Born Ilus Fleischman; later lived in Isr ael and changed her name to Ilana Fried. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 5 5therefore she was very informed of lot of things what were ha ppening after the January so-called Death March.

            "answer": "Yes, and I do not remember the details of her background, although we used to talk about that, I assume. But I do not recall it. Well everybody lost their parents the same way, but I don\u2122t even remember if she was taken out with her parents together or not. So, I cannot give you any information about that. Then later she got married and they moved to Israel. And we kept up. In fact, last year I was in Hungary and she came to Hungary, to Budapest and spent a week. So we saw each other then. And unfortunately now, she lives in Netanya. Have you ever been in Israel, yourself? And the last I heard of her, she was hit by a car. And she doesn\u2122t have any family anymore, because she never had any children. Her husband died years ago. She might have a niece or some, so she was very, very dow n with the idea of that she had enough already during concentration camp. And she was first in the hospital for a long time. Then she was in some sort of a nursing home situation, because I think she had a broken hip and whatever. And in that age, she\u2122s very little and fragile. And then she is now back in her apartment. She doesn\u2122t like to write, but she calls once in a while and I write. I write more than I call, because in a short conversation you cannot\u2013 but she\u2122s somewhat be tter, but pretty depressed by the whole situation. Because she says it was very painfu l, and really nobody who can take care of her except nurses would come to the place. And so I felt very sorry about that, because I used to say that and now she must have felt the same wa y, that one tragedy was enough, how many more do you have to have? And for her, you know, that wa s an additional something that she certainly wasn\u2122t looking forward to. That\u2122s all."

But I don\u2122t know, you have talked to a lot of Holocaust survivors, and I don\u2122t know whether I\u2122m just so na\u00efve or I was so na\u00efve at the time.

Or maybe if somebody told them, they believed it. Well, I am either very na\u00efve\u2013 I could never have believed anything like that. We did see the smoke, and the people who were there already, the first two or three years, they of course knew exactly what was going on. They were from Poland USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 6 6or Russia and they would tell us. But I assumed that they were kind of jealous that we were coming just in the last minute of the war. See, they were already suffering for three years and suffered quite a bit, you can imagine. And whoever survived that three years, they were pretty tough and kind of mean. Because a lot of the kapos in the barracks were Jewish refugees, I mean not refugees, but prisoners from way back. And I used to think that they just want to scare us, or they tell us stories which is so unbelievable. So, I never thought about that since my parents disappeared that first day, that they would have been burned."

Even, even this Eli Wiesel said that in Hungary they did not know anything about Auschwitz. We did not know anything about Auschwitz. And I don\u2122t think my parents did. At th e same time, my parents were very protective, too. They were the type of people that they didn\u2122t want to scare you. Even if they would have known a little bit more, they did not discuss that. And if we would listen to the Voice of America, which I said in my interviews before about what\u2122s going on and we would hear Hitler screaming and yelling. The concentration camps were not\u2013 we did not know anything about it. Like when we\u2122re in the train, I never knew where we are going, and I never was afraid that it\u2122s going to be Auschwitz, because I did not know anything about that. And I am talking only about myself. You can talk to somebody else maybe and they have an entire different\u2013 and you want to know my feelings.

            "answer": "I mean, later in\u2013 when we would have believed that they really\u2013? I can\u2122t remember when that came to our mind, you know. For a long, long time we thought that, you know, our parents are somewhere in another camp and ta king care of the kids who were also taken away from people. Well, I was the youngest, and I didn\u2122t have, but as I told you in one of the stories, that my sister-in-laws had little children, a four and a six year old. Well, they wouldn\u2122t have imagined that they were burned in the gas chambers. They w ould have thought that the mother was taking care of the kids in a different kind of a camp. When did we came to th e realization? Toward the very end. I think maybe even during the Death Ma rch, and we heard this over and over and over again, we assumed maybe. But it wasn\u2122t that it just happened one day. And I never remember really, crying that suddenly now I might not have my parents anymore. It is just\u2013 everything was so gradual that I couldn\u2122t recall anything like that. And I wanted to get back to Hungary. By then, I kind of knew that I\u2122m not going to find my parents there, but I had big hopes that I would find my brothers, because I didn\u2122t know what happened to them. Of course, I didn\u2122t find them either, and I have mentioned that in some of my interviews. But when did that happen? I don\u2122t really know. (Doorbell rings.)

            "answer": "Yeah, well I could even cry now, but see what it is, that what amazes me, that during that time that we were in that camp and so many horrible things were going on, I don\u2122t remember really ever crying. You know? The shock was so great. And afterwards, see, when I got back to Hungary, there was just, it was such a trauma, th e whole thing, that you know, it was almost like you were, like you were under the influence of some sort of magical thing that everything hit you all at once. And so, I don\u2122t, of course I, even now, and you know I have pictures, or when I couldn\u2122t find my brothers. But it\u2122s funny, I wasn\u2122t \u2013 it\u2122s not funny at all, but I apparently didn\u2122t cry that easily. I mean I might have held it b ack more. And the tears come now, for example, I see a program on television, not about the Holocaust, but about something, a little kid getting hurt or little\u2013 I can so easily cry and have tears, you know, over that, but with this big event what happened, that was just so much, that I\u2013 I didn\u2122t\u2013 like that we go to the cemetery when we are in my hometown, because they have a me morial for the adults and then they have a special one for the kids. My family\u2122s names are on it. And it\u2122s just, you know, you\u2122re just under, it\u2122s a shock kind of, which never left me for ever, ever and ever, you know? Then I had other traumas yet, which I might have talked a bout it or I might have not. But I don\u2122t want to jump ahead of myself. You ask me the question."

            "answer": "I don\u2122t know, I think that what made me surviv e, that I must be kind of tough. Or maybe I was brought up in a nice family home and I didn\u2122t have any upsetting situations. But I think it has a lot to do, that some people are stronger for some reason and some people are not that strong. And I was able to handle many situations which for other people might have been very dramatic and I could do it. So, it must be my personal ity that I was able to\u2013 to survive, no. No? Because you can get sick and you can die or they can kill you. But maybe the feeling that you don\u2122t give up easily. Or it\u2122s like in my story, I might have said some that we had lice and we would spend hours trying to get rid of the lice. Or if we were starving, you know, I was able to\u2013 then I was lucky that I didn\u2122t get really sick. I mean, that I don\u2122t think has anything to do with one\u2122s personality. You may be stronger, an d I\u2122m a pretty strong person. But in those days, you know, being out in January and February, you could have gotten anything and just died, but I didn\u2122t. And that I considered luck. I don\u2122t think that it\u2122s a personality. Somebody who is stronger, maybe can endure all that. So I\u2122m not sure exactly what might have caused that, that I was able to deal with it better than maybe the other people, who even now, maybe\u2013 I hate it that they have nightmares about it and they remember al l the horrible things. I think about it a lot and I remember them, but I deal with it, except someti mes it looks to me that, that wasn\u2122t me. That had to be somebody else, because up to this moment, I can\u2122t believe and can\u2122t understand how in the world somebody can survive it. And then talk about it later in life. It\u2122s\u2013 I have a hard time understanding that and I still feel that way."

So, I was mature enough to deal with it, but I worried about\u2013 see after the\u2013 and as of today, I\u2122m going to say something to you, I just thought about that. They died the way, you know how they did. And at the same time I tried to compromise with it. I mean, I\u2122m not trying to forgive Hitler USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 8 8ever, or what happened to us. But if I saw younger people with their mother doing the same things I was doing and they would beat that moth er or that mother was starving, you know? Just the thought of that for me would have been horrible. So, the way I think now that they suddenly were killed and they didn\u2122t suffer. That makes me feel almost better than if I would have gone with them maybe for half a year and then slowly they would have died. Because they were in their sixties, they weren\u2122t young. Some people were only maybe in their forties. But when I was born, my mother was already forty years old, so she had to be 63 some years old. And in those days those were already old people, but they were healthy people. I never seen them sick or, you know, in bed, in fact, with a sickness. So, to me , seeing them suffer right next to you would have been almost worse. I mean, I don\u2122t know if a nybody ever felt that way. Because if they could have survived the whole thing, that\u2122s a different story, but at that age, not many older people could survive it. So.

And I have already told that story, so I don\u2122t want to really repeat myself. The camps, unless you really would want to, I haven\u2122t looked at my notes again, many of the names I got from my friend, Ilus. Because she remembered names very well. But Ravensbr\u00fcck really was the most famous one, but nobody\u2013 it wasn\u2122t really a camp for us anymore. It was gathering places. And wherever, like what you mentione d near Dresden, this Malchow, it wasn\u2122t that we were supposed to be working there or we were supposed to be doing anything there. It was just a stop during the wandering around or the trains and so on and so forth. So, the last part of it, which I (coughs) excuse me, I already mentioned before, on the open field, where I ran into a lot of the\u2013 even some people from my hometown, by then ther e were no camps, it was just\u2013 but by then the weather was a little bit better, because it was sp ringtime. So we wouldn\u2122t suffer from ice and cold and so on. But our main and worse situatio n was in ice and cold and snow, trying to stop and sit down and possibly freeze to death.

She was from Yugosla via. She spoke the Slavic languages, so in Czechoslovakia she could understand some of the Czecho\u2013 so, she found out a lot of little things, exactly where we were. And I was immob ilized because of that surgery on my arm. So my arm was all tied up, so I didn\u2122 t run around as easily as she did. Like, the train would stop and then some people would bring up some food. That was, of course, after the war was over. Or she would go down, they asked her down to a kitchen and they give her something to eat and then she would bring some. But I just stayed put, because it was kind of hard for me to get around with that. And that was painful, because those things had to heal. But you know it\u2122s ___________ because that\u2122s the way I remember, and a ny other questions I\u2122ll be glad to help you."

            "question": "Just on the subject of your strength and being strong enough to survive that and also having the luck to survive it. I was wondering about your, how you thought of yourself and how you remember yourself before the war. You mentioned that during the war you just didn\u2122t cry and that now you can cry at little things. But before the war was your personality that way? Did you ever cry then?",
            "answer": "No, I don\u2122t remember that I was\u2013 I wasn\u2122t pa mpered really, by my parents, although they had the means. But I remember\u2013 I don\u2122t think I was really spoiled. I was spoiled by them not to share bad news. So, that\u2122s one thing I remember so well. Like my older brother was ill, had some sort of a lung problem in his high school ye ar. They took him to Budapest and the lungs had to be filled at that time, you know that was more complicated. They never scared me with all that. Or I remember my younger brother, who was four years older than I am. He once, he lived in another town, worked also in a bank. And he must have gotten sick with some sort of a so-called blood disease where the white cells were more than the red cells or so on and I didn\u2122t quite understand the whole thing. And my parents would talk to them on the phone and I think they were worried about what wa s going on, but then he got well. But they never, ever shared the worry with me, so therefore I was not exposed to anything bad, ever, up to that point. You know? My parents lived together and my brother\u2013 we were\u2013 it was a close-knit family, but not a spoiled. You know, like my father had pr obably enough money, but I made a big deal of asking for money. I remember I would say and that they laughed about that. That\u2122s not important to the interview, but I would say, \ufb01I have a real, real, real big favor to ask, and a real USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 11 11big favor to ask.\ufb02 And they didn\u2122t know what it was I wanted, ten cents or 25 cents. I mean, I made a big deal about it, you know? So up to the last moment that was the way I was brought up. My bad parts was my Catholic high school at th e last year, which also was in my interview, because one of the nuns was very anti-Semitic and that hurt my feeling very much. But there again, I didn\u2122t cry. I couldn\u2122t object to it. It wasn\u2122t like nowadays, people protest. So, I had to kind of swallow it and live with it. So, I don\u2122t remember ever bei ng very upset or that I got hurt easily, you know, like some people ge t hurt over everything. I had friends and they liked me and I liked them and somehow that \u2122s the way I was brought up."

From ghetto time on, it hit us. It\u2122s just like for everybody else. But you might have had intervie ws with some people, maybe they had a bad childhood or maybe somebody was abusive. And who knows? I didn\u2122t have any of that. It hit me at the time when the Germans came in. A nd I read that other places, too, people didn\u2122t imagine it could happen to you. And we never im agined that it could happen to us, whatever was happening, everything was gradual. You know, the giving up your whole place, the ghetto, the brick factory. It just\u2013 it hit you and we had to face it and I did without any, you know, any crying, temper or fighting it. The only upset points I would have, and would see again my parents sitting in front of our ghetto home, where it was raining and th ey had to leave their stuff. I always used to think that they had all the nice things and now you just have to leave it there. So, I always felt more sorry for them than for my self at the time. That\u2122s the way I remember."

And I have mentioned in some of the interviews how I found about what happened to my brothers, so I don\u2122t want to repeat myself to that. But everything was still completely like a dream type of a thing, because I remember that people wanted me to me et friends and get togeth er with them. And I was just like, like blindfolded. I did what I was told. I didn\u2122t have my own personality, you know. I don\u2122t remember much about the time, yo u know. And I was in Budapest for a whole year before I came out to this country. And some things are fairly vivid in my mind, some people I don\u2122t even remember. I just really don\u2122 t remember. I don\u2122t know if I ever mentioned it, before the war they wanted me to marry some body. Did I say that? I don\u2122t know whether that\u2122s important, but there was a real good friend of ours, a family. He was a lawyer and they were rich people. And their nephew got married to a gi rl in my hometown, who is still alive now somewhere. I never see her anymore, but she li ved in Israel. And that person who was marrying the girl brought his cousin. And they lived somewhere in the Yugoslavian area and they were big farmers or landlords, landholders and very rich people.

And I don\u2122t know that should be in the Holocaust Museum, but\u2013 briefly I would say it was a big dinner and I sat next to that guy and enough that he invited me to go to where he lives and meet his parents. And my mother and I to ok a train and we went with this guy\u2013 can\u2122t even rememb er his name anymore. It was beautiful. They waited for us with a sleigh. So, I liked, only thing is the sleigh rides in the snow. And at that time, of course, I knew my husband by then, because we were growi ng up together. We came to the United States and I liked him. And I certainly didn\u2122t like th at guy. He was like about ten years older than I am. And so on the way back, on the train, I used my personality, where I might have cried, and told my mother, \ufb01I absolutely don \u2122t want anything to do with this situation.\ufb02 And they accepted it. They didn\u2122t force me to do that. But I think I was very upset and I might have cried then. On the train home I kind of said, \ufb01No way do I want to do that.\ufb02 But then after the war, people wanted me to meet a friend and so on. And it\u2122s very vague in my mind. I can\u2122t remember. I love music and somebody, my husband\u2122s wife, they got married just before the war. Not my husband\u2122s, I\u2122m sorry, my brother. And she got me some opera tickets and I liked opera at the time, it\u2122s a season ticket. And I went to all that because I was told to do but I didn\u2122t have my heart in it. You know? It was ju st something that I was so vague and my girlfriend, and I think I might have said that. She was my good friend, who is still a friend of mine and I still see her all the time. She sometimes comes to the United States and I have been visiting her."

And at that time, he used to play the vio lin and I used to play the piano. And we belonged to the same music school. And we did by then, like I was teenager, maybe fourteen and he might have been 15 and a half. And we had some pieces that we played together and then there would be a recital, and we did\u2013 so those are the ways that we really\u2013 and then we played tennis together and his sister was a friend of mine, who is \u2013 in fact, she\u2122s coming August the 5th. She now lives in Argentina. She was one of them who had a little child and lost the child, and she\u2122s coming to visit. And then he fell in love with me more, when, you know, you\u2122re 16 or 17. And before he left, and he would ask me, he said he\u2122s going to marry me. And of course, he was only eighteen and I was sixteen and a half and he left to the United States. So, all kind of things could have happened. But I remember we went to Budapest at one time because I had to\u2013 no, he had to go after his papers, because he had an uncle in Washington, D.C., who brought him out with a student visa. A nd then he went to school in Washington. And so, for a while, until 1941, he would write very frequently. And like, I think I might have mentioned that for my birthday, he would as k his mother and she would send a bouquet of a hundred red roses, which at that time\u2013 she paid for it. And I think it wasn\u2122t as expensive as it is now. But then the war came in \u201a41 and after th at, I never heard from him. First of all, you couldn\u2122t get letters. He was in the service, in the Army, Air Force, actually. So, that was about, but we played ping pong together. I mean, Eger is a small town and the Jewish community wasn\u2122t really that big. And by then when I graduated from high school, we really didn\u2122t keep up with our non-Jewish friends that much."

So, he stayed away and then I suddenly thought to myself, well it\u2122s more than\u2013 you know, I really didn\u2122t want to stay away. So, I felt the same way toward him, but see I was younger and I went to a Catholic high school, and we had friends after that. And I had a boyfriend later, whom I really liked very much, but differently than Sandy. Because he was the kind of guy I would have never wanted to marry. And he flirted with one girl and then with another and then with a third one. But he was that type, you know, that it was more like being impr essed by he was somewhat after me, but at the same time I would know that he would be after a divorced woman and have two other girlfriends here and there.

And then he wanted to have the girls come to the United States, which didn\u2122t work out, because one went back to Hungary. The other one stayed and married somebody there.

But what I must say now, and I don\u2122t know if I ever said it. That I still, at this moment, I have this kind of a feeling that I compare things to the 1944 situation. And I always used to think that\u2122s very hard, but how much better it is than it was then. S o, everything in all my life, since then, I compare it to, lots of times. That if I was able to take that , my God, I should be able to take this. It wasn\u2122t that easy, but he, after school he would come over and then we would go out. Then we would try, it wasn\u2122t that easy, because ten years went by, but we knew we were getting married, and it was\u2013 you had to adjust to that, too. Plus I don\u2122t think I talked too much about my experiences then. And he loved music and we talked about music, so on, and then we had a very small wedding and I must have told that to Mary K. And so, it was just something that I could adjust to things, easier I think than ma ybe many other people. And if so mething is a hardship or like, you could say, \ufb01My God you haven\u2122t been with him for a l ong time, that must have been hard.\ufb02 Must have been hard to be in a home, a nice home in Washington, D.C. with an American woman and a Hungarian man, but who has been in this country since age 14, children who wanted to be nice to me, but it\u2122s hard. And it wa s hard, but I adjusted to that too. And I mean I didn\u2122t suffer, because I thought this is for, toward the better. And I always compared things like that, even as of today, I put things on a scale in my mind, and how would it be better, you know? And so I adjust to things easier, I think. See I don\u2122t know whether I told Mary K. about my Bloomington experiences or did we talk about that? USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 18 18"

And anything what I had valuable which people gave me, maybe jewelry and I can\u2122t remember, as pr esents or Sandy\u2122s sister has given me certain things from her mom, was in that. And I held onto it in Paris. I took care of all my belongings. And when we arrived in New York and a second uncle of Sandy and his son, waited for me and came with us to the railroad station. And by then I felt I don\u2122t have to watch that much anymore. I think I just didn\u2122t take care of my things as much. And wh en they were putting the things into the cab\u2013 I didn\u2122t have that much belonging, but that little black suitcase was missing. So somebody as we were talking right next to the, on the railroad station waiting for a cab to come, must have picked it up and they stole it. And that disappointed me tremendously, because I thought this country is very safe. Things like that, it would not happen. Because Sandy always used to write to me that they put a 25 cents down near the newspaper an d nobody takes that 25 cents and you can just get your paper. So, I thought no crime is happening in this country. And that was one of my disappointments. The other one was the Ellis Island and I had to be there. And he also wrote to me that the uncle had a black, they had a black maid. And he said to me that, you know, you gotta be, if you are going to meet her\u2013 because I\u2122 ve never seen black people. And he just kind of tried to make me realize that, well, we were very liberal, in all this, in our upbringing, and Sandy was too, that you got to be very nice and not make difference between a black and a white. And then when I met her, of course, she was very nice, but that was the first time I ever seen a black person, but I was already warned by Sandy that you got to be very nice. They\u2122re just like whites and they can\u2122t help that they\u2122re persecuted and stuff like that. So, I was prepared for all that. And I tell you, in this country, in Louisville, Kentucky, I was terribly disappointed at one time. I met a young couple, Jewish couple, w ho invited us to their house. And I don\u2122t know where they are now and they seemed like they we re prejudiced against blacks from their talk. And I couldn\u2122t believe it. I could not understand it as of today, and I know there are very many Jewish people who are prejudiced towards blacks. Now, I know. I couldn\u2122t believe that anybody who is persecuted themselves, how can they be prejudiced towards somebody else.

The campus, I heard, bought them all from some where for a dollar apie ce. And we paid 25 dollars for that. The third part was just big enough for a little crib, so I don\u2122t think it was as big as this. Might have been half of the size. I was very\u2013 I accepted that, too.

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 22 22When he came to this country, he asked his uncle, the first Rosh Hashanah, that he would like to go to the synagogue.

But since we did not observe it, the way some, and I don\u2122t know how religious your fa mily is, so I\u2122m not comparing myself to anybody else. I\u2122m just telling it to you. Therefor e I didn\u2122t expect my children to become that religious either. I took them to Sunday school , because I felt like they should have that background. But the Sunday schools at that time, at least where we belonged, was not anything that I would think desirable. The teachers were just volunteer people. The discipline was not very good. The kids could do anything they wanted to and if they left Sunday school and they walked over to an ice cream place and they came b ack. I would hear stories like that. And that disappointed me, because it didn\u2122t leave any im pression on them. Now, the Sunday schools now that, let me see, my daughter, Linda, is marri ed to a Jewish guy. And they do belong and I do too, now, to Temple Shalom, which is actually on e branch of the B\u2122rith Sholom, which long time ago closed up. And Adath Israel and B\u2122rith Sh olom merged and it became the Temple, which is a big and fancy one and a lot of rich people belong there. And th e Temple Shalom is a lot more Reformed and we do like our rabbi very much. And I go on High Holy days. I don\u2122t go that often, but he\u2122s a real nice guy. And Linda\u2122s kids go to Sunday school. And the teachers are nice. They learn a lot more and they like to go. My kids didn\u2122t like to go, because they just didn\u2122t get anything out of it. And I\u2122m sorry about that, but that\u2122s the way it was. Now, my son USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 23 23in-law here, Mark, actually even teaches Sunday school at that same place. And I felt like I wanted to join. Sandy wouldn\u2122t have cared either way. I said, now in my older age, I kind of felt like\u2013 because I\u2122m not so religious, but I have my, a traditional background, which you can never ever get out of your system. So, it\u2122s not the same as the way I remember the high holidays in Europe. Everything was in Hebrew and I remember on Yom Kippur, I would go and visit my family while they were sitting, all day long at the synagogue. We were not Orthodox. We didn\u2122t keep kosher, so\u2013 and I like that. Because I knew a lot of religious people who\u2013 like in Sandy\u2122s family maybe they didn\u2122t eat in their home , but they would go out and eat stuff that they really shouldn\u2122t. Or Mark\u2122s family in Brooklyn, th ey were very religious. They kept kosher. When they come to visit to Louisville, we w ould go out for dinner and absolutely never failed that the father would not order maybe bacon or ha m or that kind of thing. And I felt like that\u2122s kind of, you know, it\u2122s not really true. Either you keep it or you don\u2122t keep it. They were very nice people. They\u2122re both dead now and I liked them very much. But my family wasn\u2122t like that. We ate anything and we weren\u2122t\u2013 and I kind of like that.

And I did USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 24 24that from all the way till the end of our stayi ng there, which was sometimes in the middle of summer. And we went back to Bloomington, Indian a, because he had to get his Ph.D. See that was just a year internship. Not much to be told about that year . You know, I had two kids and I worked and he worked, so not much was happening."

And the subject never came up. And I was so busy with the kids that, you know, I didn\u2122t talk about it, or\u2013 I remember we were renting in Marion, a National home for 92 dollars. And I was sick one time with strep throat. And Sandy got a call somewhere about some pay rais e, something. And he got so excited and he was doing the laundry. And we had some sort of washing machine that you had to stop it in between all the periods. And suddenly the water overflowed and the water was coming all over the whole National home, you know, it\u2122s\u2013 I don\u2122t know if you know what they are like. They are pre-fab houses, so they\u2122re not very super, but it was nice. It was like a two or three bedroom little house with a modern kitchen. It was very nice. So then not much happened in Marion and we went back to Bloomington, Indiana. And we bought a car. That was our first time that we had a car already in Marion. And I learned, actually practiced, how to drive at the VA, because it was just a nice big campus that no traffic. But my real expe rience for learning how to drive was still in Bloomington, Indiana. For five dollars, we got like a course, and I learned how to drive, but since we didn\u2122t have a car, I couldn\u2122t practice it. So, in Marion we did have a car and I practiced how to drive. And I went back to Bloomington, Indiana, I got my license. End of Tape 2, Side A USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 25 25Tape 2, Side B"

            "question": "This is tape number two, side B.",
            "answer": "So then we\u2013 how did we get to Louisville, your question was. A friend of Sandy\u2122s heard about a job and he was offered that job. It was a post-doctoral fellowship at the Child Guidance Clinic here in Louisville. And his name was Fred Kanfer and he was more an experimental psychologist, not a clinical psychologist. And he did not want the job and he mentioned it to Sandy. And so he came to Louisville and he appl ied for it. And he got that job at the Child Guidance Clinic, which was for one year only. And that was kind of very nice. We lived in an apartment in the South end, it\u2122s where I met the person, who I first felt like, she still must like me, even so that she found out that I was Jewi sh. Now that was many years later. And the people at the Child Guidance Clinic were very, very nice. They are all older social workers or psychiatrists or psychologists. They practically took us in like a family. They had lot of family get-togethers. And we didn\u2122t go out otherwise. Because then my daughter was born, Linda was born, in 1954. So we moved to Louisville in \u201a53 and we still lived in the South end when she was born. And our assignment was only for one year. And now my story is really important here, but I couldn\u2122t see myself moving in September when she was supposed to born in September. And we didn\u2122t have much money be cause that pay was, you know, quite little. And our apartment at the Washington Park apartmen ts was already then eighty-two dollars and ninety-five cents or so. We had to pay utilities, too. So I told Sandy just anything he could do. And by then I could walk to the grocery, because it was right behind our apartments. I could walk, we had one car, I could walk to the pediatrician. And I never did anything else, like go to town or do that kind of stuff. And I said, \ufb01I wish we could stay just at least maybe for one more year, so we don\u2122t have to move just exactly in September.\ufb02 Because they usually would have seminars and then people would go to those seminars and then people come with job opportunities. So Sandy would have had to go to one of those things and find a job. And we would have had to move. Well, it was very, very hard even for me to imagine and so, the Child Guidance Clinic gave him a part time job. And at Norton he worked part time and in one other hospital it was part time. I mean, just very little, here and there. Then he met two psychiatrists, who needed somebody and they became our fr iends, too. And they needed somebody who would do some testing for them. And they offered him to try and see if he would like that. And he tried it and they offered him a nice salary and that\u2122s how we stayed in Louisville. He worked with them for a long time. And those psychiatrist s are still alive and they are very nice people. We\u2122re still friends. And Linda was born in \u201a54, so I didn\u2122t have to move away. And then we stayed in the apartments until 1957. And we we re looking for a house and we found this and we have been here ever since."

I was very busy with the kids. And I didn\u2122t even watch, well we didn\u2122t have any television at that time , I remember. It was later. And when you get busy, I spend a lot more time now , listening to the news and being involved. But I was a very conscientious mother and there wa s just a lot to do. By then I had three kids and you know, diapers and just\u2013 I was very, very busy. And since Sandy worked, day and very many times in the evening, he wasn\u2122t really that much of a help. He couldn\u2122t. In summertime we would go one vacation, we did every year. Because his uncle in Washington had a summer home in Annapolis, Maryland and he offered for us to go there. So, we would leave in the evening and drive all night to get to Annapolis by next day. And we would spend two weeks there, which was again, some mothers might have been complaining about it, but I did not. It wasn\u2122t really that easy on me, because, you know , I did the cooking and it wasn\u2122t a luxury. But the kids had a good time, you know, Sandy would take them out and they would fish and maybe they go on a boat ride. But Linda was still a baby, so I was really more like a mom over there, than it was a really exciting vacation. So, we had done that for many years, till my youngest one was two years old, and then they sold that place. But no, I did not remember anything that I was that worried about that. And when we come to schools maybe, you might like to\u2013 and I will have a really important story, too, about my oldest son, Andy, who\u2013 the school was nearby us here, where we live even now. That\u2122s where he went to elementary school."

Th en, we, well in the South end, I\u2122m sorry we lived. Andy went to, isn\u2122t that funny, I forgot the name of it, now. There was an elementary school there. And he was in fourth grade when we moved here. And my youngest daughter, I mean Elizabeth was two years younger, so she went to kindergarten over there. And the name would come to me later, but I don\u2122t think it\u2122s that impor tant. So in here, since we lived all our life here, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 27 27let me just talk about that. They went to Belknap Elementary School. And then to, and Andy finished here. He was in sixth grade. And he met some really nice friends on our street. Then they went to Highland Junior High School. Now, the friend, who we met here and became friendly with Andy was two years older. Non-Jewish people, he was very liberal type. And he started a club. I don\u2122t know how much you know about social clubs. We belonged to the Jewish Community Center, too. Sandy was pretty against those things, but he always said, I wish they would ask them and I wish they could refuse it, meaning, you know\u2013 because he had problems, you know, as a child psychologist with kids, they\u2122re so upset and depressed over that they were not included in one of those clubs. And those social clubs were horrible things, but they existed. So, my kids were invited to it, but they weren\u2122t terribly active at the Jewish Community Center. For example, they had those, it\u2122s really not im portant to even talk about. But Andy\u2122s friend started a new club. It was called the Princeton. And there was no question that blacks should not be a part of it or Jews should not be part of it, he was that kind of a kid."

And he was in the marching band, but he never li ked to wear uniforms. He had had to, would have, but they were just kind of\u2013 that psychiatrist\u2122s son, who gave Sandy the job, he had a son Andy\u2122s age. And they were together in the ma rching band. And they would carry their uniform. They wouldn\u2122t be caught dead putting it on and go like that. I\u2122ll try to make that all brief. He graduated from high school in 1966 and went away to college to Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin. He left in September. I got him all ready, with clothes and everything else. By then I had my youngest one, who was six years old, because he was born in 1960\u2013"

I was just cleaning up all the leaves in the yard, got a call from Appleton that Andy was in an accident. Well, what happened, that they lived on the dorm\u2013 and there was a church, wh ich was already barricaded and people didn\u2122t go in there, but sometimes they did, with the idea boys will be boys. One of Andy\u2122s friends asked him if he wouldn\u2122t mind coming up there. And Andy says, \ufb01Oh, I\u2122ve been there last week.

                " The reason this is important, because at that time when this happened, I thought to myself, the Holocaust was enough. And I didn\u2122t expect to have another something like this to happen. But I handled that pretty well, too. But I remember when the telephone calls were done and my friend\u2122s wife offered that she\u2122ll come with me to Appleton. And I said, well maybe that\u2122s not necessary. We left John Bell, Dr. Bell is the psychiatrist who reached Sandy at the Atlanta airport and he turned right back around on the airplane. So my friend, his wife, took me to the airport and we felt if he will be on that plane that we were supposed to be taking, then Nancy would not come with me. In the meantime, I had to leave my six year old son, Linda was ten and Elizabeth was twelve. But at that time, Sandy ha s a sister, whose daughter just graduated from high school, who was Andy\u2122s age. And she came to st ay with us for a whole year. And that was the year that she was staying here, from Buenos Aires, Argentina. And she had a hard time to adjust, too. She was very homesi ck. But at that time she alre ady decided she\u2122s staying. Now, she was a, she was, she liked to cook, and she was\u2013 well, I had a help in the house too, not all the time, but a couple times a week. So, I just packed my stuff. I remember the kids all standing next to me. And I thought about cold weather an d warm weather and I packed my suitcase. And with her, with Kathy being here, who is 18. No, I\u2122m sorry, Elizabeth was sixteen and Linda was twelve and Robert was six. So, anyway, I said, \ufb01I just have to leave.\ufb02 And I was hoping that everything will turn out okay. And I\u2122m still seei ng the kids standing there, they were, you know, of course terribly worried. And I went to the airport. Sandy was on that plane coming back from Atlanta and we flew to Appleton, Wisconsin. It was in the middl e of the night. We didn\u2122t know what we were going to find. And it was, you know, really heartbreaking in a way, and we\u2013 somebody took us into the hospital and Andy was under all kind of wires. And he was in a coma actually for about three days, completely out of it. And Sandy stayed with me until he was coming to, and\u2013 not that he was better, but he was not in a coma anymore. And one very important story I must tell you. The day we arrived, of course there was an article in that, in the Appleton paper. And somebody called the hospital and wanted to meet the parents of this young boy. And that was a Catholic family, a mother a nd a father, who had also four children, but they were already older and out of the house. And they came to the hospital and not even knowing me or Sandy, they offered their house. They lived pretty close to the hospital. That I could stay with them. And they were wonderful. And now see, something like that makes me cry. I was there for six weeks and I could walk from the hosp ital to their home. The kids were out of her house already, so she had a place. I could talk to somebody at ni ght about how things are going. And otherwise I spent the whole day in the hospital. See the result of all this was, that eventually, I mean, his spinal cord was injured and he became a paraplegic. But we didn\u2122t know that for a long time, you know. I don\u2122t know if you know anybody, when people are this sick, that for example they have movements in their leg, which is just nothing. It doesn\u2122t mean anything. But sometimes I would talk to them on the phone all the time. See Sandy stayed for a little while and then he went back home. S o, I talked to them on the phone all the time and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 29 29eventually I got, and I still have that, I never wanted to throw it away. I thought now when Andy died, then maybe I will throw it away. I can not . I have letters and letters and letters people wrote to me, to the hospital. And I still have them. In fact, just a little while ago, I re-read them. I never, never could open those letters until just recently. And they were helping with the kids and they were bringing food for them and you know, they were\u2013 the kids were wonderful. They were behaving very nicely. And so, I was there for six weeks. At Christmas time or holiday time, they came, all of them, to Appleton. And that\u2122s the only time we stayed in a hotel, because this family, named Alice and Art, children came home for the holidays and there was not enough room. But that made it so much easier for me. And of course, I couldn\u2122t sleep well and I got some tranquilizers from this psychiatrist doctor. Which even maybe even two pills couldn\u2122t make me relax enough. But I there again was\u2013 I don\u2122t think I cried. I was under tremendous tension all the time, and not knowing what the outc ome will be. Appleton was finished. Finally we decided that we can bring him home. S o, with an ambulance we brought him home to Louisville. And of course, he couldn\u2122t sit up or anything like that. I mean, it was\u2013 he was paralyzed from waist down. But at that time he wa sn\u2122t absolutely sure ab out it, but they gave him a final test. And the final test showed that the spinal cord was completely severed, so injured, and that doesn\u2122t look like, you know, it can be ever\u2013 but making the story short, we put him here in Louisville, into a hospital, which at that time was the St. Anthony Hospital. We had a friend who was that kind of doctor who dealt with this kind of injuries, except\u2013 he was a wonderful man, he was a friend, but he didn\u2122t know enough about the whole deal. Because I remember we were very disappoint ed. The hospital, like the orderly put him, in the bathroom, put him on the toilet and left him there. I mean his back was\u2013 he shouldn\u2122t have done that. He was there for six weeks and at the very end, our friend, the psychiatrist, made arrangements at the Rusk Institute in New York City. That they can transfer him there. Which they did, and just very briefly, before they left, a nurse offered, private nurse will stay with us for the weekend, before Andy goes, because Andy wanted to come home for the weekend. Well, that woman was absolutely, she should have never been a nurse. She tried to show, she said that she had a daughter who had polio and that daughter of hers walked after a while. She kept on telling Andy, if you have faith, you will be walking again. Well, she should have never said that. And then we were over here in that weekend in my ho use. She made him, with crutches and braces, stand above behind the wheelchair. And Kathy, who is a big, heavyset girl, sat in the wheelchair. And he wanted to prove something, that how mu ch he advanced. Well, with the braces, he couldn\u2122t walk, but she made him stand up. So, then he sat in a chair in the living room and he says, \ufb01Boy that feels good.\ufb02 And the nurse says, \ufb01Maybe it feels good for you, but it\u2122s not\u2013 maybe it feels good, but it\u2122s not good for you.\ufb02 And Andy says, \ufb01Maybe it\u2122s not good for me, but it still feels good.\ufb02 And the woman got so angr y, that came out to the kitchen and says, \ufb01I\u2122m leaving.\ufb02 And I went out to the kitchen\u2013 yes, I did cry then. I gave her the check, what I owed her. And I couldn\u2122t believe it, he was sitting in that chair upstairs. And Sandy calls home, \ufb01How is everything going?\ufb02 And I says , whatever the nurse\u2122s name was, she left. \ufb01I\u2122ll be right home.\ufb02 So, he came home and we had some real good friends , who are still our friends. He used to be our family doctor and his wife, and Doctor Eskind and his wife came over because they knew Andy\u2122s going to leave. And they wanted to say good-bye to him. And Andy\u2122s sitting in the chair. I tell them the whole story. They c ouldn\u2122t believe it. And finally Sandy and Harold Eskind help him down\u2013 we have all those st eps\u2013 helped him down to the bedroom. And Harold says, \ufb01I\u2122ll come over tomorrow morning.\ufb02 See she was supposed to be here and help us getting him ready. I mean, you know, with a parapl egic, it takes a long time to do that. And USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 30 30Harold said, \ufb01I\u2122ll come over early in the morning, because I\u2122m not sure when the plane was leaving.\ufb02 And we said, \ufb01Oh don\u2122t worry about it. We\u2122ll just get up an hour earlier,\ufb02 or whatever. And Robert that night, who was only six, slept in the TV room right opposite of our bedroom. I mean, he was upset and he was worr ied. And he woke up with a hundred and four fever. And so, as I said, loud, I said, \ufb01God, we sure could use Doctor Eskind now. And as I said that, apparently our living room was open and he did come anyway. And he was walking in and he says, \ufb01Here I am.\ufb02 That was, you know, like an angel coming from heaven. He helped us get, he helped us getting Andy ready. He gave Robert a shot, I think, whatever he needed. I didn\u2122t go with them. It was only Sandy and Andy who flew to\u2013 the Ruskin Institute did marvels. He was there for six weeks. Luckily his mind was comp letely well. They taught him how to drive. They taught him how to get dressed. They ta ught him complete independency. And Andy used to be a very stubborn kid as a young person. When he wanted to do something, he wanted to do it right then. And that helped him tremendously in his accident. Of course, he decided and I have a beautiful paper, which he wrote, then la ter he\u2013 I don\u2122t want to jump ahead of myself, but he learned how to do all this. He got a car. It had a hand control. And he was home the first year. He used to have a girl friend from Myrtle Beach from befo re his accident. He says he wants to visit her. And we begged him, it\u2122s too early, yet. I mean he\u2013 all by himself to go to North Carolina or wherever the girl lived. He says, \ufb01If I would know that I\u2122m going to walk next year, I would wait, but since I know I\u2122m not going t o, I want to do it right now.\ufb02 He got in the car, he drove over there. I said, \ufb01Please call us the minute you get there.\ufb02 He did. So, anyway he was really unbelievably\u2013 you know, I still say that. Then he went back to Lawrence, he went back to Lawrence University for a semester . And he did very well, but it got very cold there in Wisconsin and the snow was so high, that he couldn\u2122t even get out of his dormitory to get to the, like to the classes. So, Sandy sent somebody, a young man, w ho moved him back and he was transferred to Houston, Texas. To the University where the climate is different. So, he went back there and he finished college in three and a half years, instead of four. I mean, he made up. And in summer time, he went to Chap el Hill, North Carolina and spent summer school there. And one summer he went to Boston, to Ha rvard, just for a semester. So, he made up all his lost time. He finished and then he moved out to California. He was very independent. He did everything on his own. And in the beginning, he didn\u2122t really want to come back that much. I think the memories and all that. For example, he was fighting th at we shouldn\u2122t put an elevator in the house. He didn\u2122t want us to move and we didn\u2122t. We tried to put an elevator in, but with this split-level it wasn\u2122t that easy. And when he would come home, he was so matter of fact of anybody who wanted to help him, lift him up. I mea n, he got used to the idea. Then he decided he\u2122s going to go to Social Work school. A nd he applied to Kent Social Work School (ph) and that\u2122s when he wrote\u2013 I could give you that, I mean just for your own fun. When he applied to the school, he wrote a beautiful paper, which now after he died, Sandy made a bunch of copies of them. And just since you\u2122re in terested and all, I give you a copy of that and also a newspaper clipping after he died. He got interested in California and don\u2122t ask me why, with a Lyndon LaRouche political group. I don\u2122t know if you ever heard of him or not. But he met tremendous amount and good friends through all those years, who became so close to him, that in the beginning, I wondered what they are like. But then later on we me t them. They became, besides the political adventures, they were interested in poetry. And Andy also loved music, became more and more so. He had a selection of CD\u2122s bigger than we have. And he, first they lived in San Francisco, then they moved to Livermore, Calif ornia and I visited him there. I met some of those people. And then they moved to Los Angeles and I was there. Now just a year and a half USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 31 31ago, couple of years ago, he had to have a surgery, a bladder surgery. The doctor recommended him, that if he wouldn\u2122t do it, then eventually his kidneys would become infected by it. He decided, we asked a lot of informations whet her is that a good thing to do. And everybody recommended. And I went to Los Angeles. I stay ed with him for three and a half weeks, while he had the surgery. When\u2013 Sandy and I went toge ther and then after Sandy had to leave and I stayed. And the people were very, very nice. They gave a big party. And they were singing and they read poetry before he went into the hospital. Then after that they kept on coming all the time. They enlarged the bladder, took a part of the intestine and made the bladder bigger. So, anyway, that was the\u2013 whatever they had to do. _________. In fact, both of his doctors were Jewish, just so happened that from the name I c ould tell. Nice, nice people, very nice. And he was in a hospital in Los Angeles, in a Mexican, you know, there were a lot of Mexican and Spanish speaking people there. And I worried a little bit, because he didn\u2122t have to pay a penny. It was, you know he was\u2013 since he was a handicapped person, he had all the facilities there, which were paid. And they were wonderful. So, I was pleased with that. He recuperated. We went home and he worried that his appetite is not as good as it used to be. I said, \ufb01Don\u2122t worry, I mean, they messed up your stomach. You\u2122ll be a ll right.\ufb02 So, my big job was cooking for him, plus showing him the CD\u2122s, which one he wants fi rst. And we played all day long. The people he lived with, he had two roommates. Andy neve r got married, two guys. They were very nice. Then I came home. Then I have never seen him afterwards, but he was all right. He was going to come back. And one day, on a Sunday, January 24 th, I get a phone call from his roommate. And Chuck says, \ufb01I have very sad news for you.\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01What?\ufb02 I thought he might have gotten sick again and then I would have gone out to be with him. Well, he died in his sleep. He didn\u2122t wake up. It was a Sunday mo rning, from Saturday to Sunday. Saturday night, he was in the office and they were doing some kind of an experiment. They were really bright, intelligent people. How they got involved with Lyndon LaRouche\u2013 End of Tape 2, Side B USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 32 32Tape 3, Side A ",
                " And I dealt with it, but I remember when I got this news I couldn\u2122t believe it. And I still right now, when I say to you that Auschwitz seems like a dream and it wasn\u2122t me. Sometimes I think of this and I said, \ufb01Is it really true that he\u2122s no longer alive?\ufb02 But then again, I measure certain things. We used to worry, what will happen to Andy when we die, and this group falls apart? My daughter, Linda, she\u2122s a nurse and she says, \ufb01Don\u2122t worry. I\u2122ll take care of him.\ufb02 Well, Andy didn\u2122t like to be taken care of. He could do everything in the world on his own. Anything. Driving, shopping. I mean you wouldn\u2122t believe it, if I give you something about this, you wouldn\u2122t believe it. Like we have a friend here, who took him on a Sierra weekend, canoe trip. And in the mud, she pushed the wheelchair and he would get into the canoe. I mean, there was nothing that he would not want to do. He was just brave. And when I got this note, I mean I couldn\u2122t believe it. And we didn\u2122t know quite what to do. We had Sandy\u2122s sister here from Hungary for three months, who was eighty-four year s old. She took this very hard, plus she was too old to travel. So, my youngest son, Robert, offered that he\u2122ll come with me to Los Angeles. And we flew over there a week later. That was the end of, it was January 31st that they had a memorial service for him. And it was really very, very nice. Wh en I went into that room\u2013 and I know Jewish funerals, well that wasn\u2122t a funeral, just a memorial. They had some flowers. They had a big poster of Andy. He was very involved with\u2013 he loved Shakespeare, and they were very intellectual, but at the same time th ey were just nice, nice people. And we had a lovely\u2013 the whole memorial service lasted for three and half hours and about 11:30, well everybody decided, it\u2122s time to quit. But there we re speeches and people were sending letters and all the letters were, some people read poems. The day when this happened, in Andy\u2122s house, they were meeting for a poetry reading group, at 11 o\u2122clock, every Sunday. And Andy didn\u2122t get up on time, so they were kind of thinking that he went to bed late, maybe he just didn\u2122t wake up. But they\u2013 and they wondered why, but they weren\u2122t going to wake him up. And later on, a few hours later, when he still wasn\u2122t up, Chuck opened his door and he was in bed, asleep. And he had died maybe about maybe three, four o\u2122cloc k. So, he did not take good care of his eating habits, I think. He loved all the things which are really not that good for you, butter and salami. He exercised, but only in the wheelchair, naturally. And he just, it had to be a, it was his heart, you know, like he must have had clogged-up arteries . Although when he had that surgery, they checked him out and he was okay then. I mean, th ere were no problems, but that was a year and a half later. And that\u2122s really what happened. Now you can ask me all kinds of questions. "

He\u2122s now 15, when he was 13 years old. And Andy came for that. And then the rabbi asked him to read something at that occasion. So, he met him.

The first time a friend wanted to take me to the house where I was living up to the age 12. It\u2122s\u2013 the houses in Europe are closed up, you know, the big doors and you can\u2122t see inside. So, that person rang the doorbell and I was very reluctant to do this. And somebody came to the door and he says, \ufb01Well this young lady lived in this house long time ago.\ufb02 They took me in. Of course, nothing was the way it was at the time, becau se in the meantime there was a war. There were chicken and pigs, you know like. We had flower gardens then.

And then the next time\u2013 that was in \u201a71. Of course it, I mean the fi rst time, it was really har d. I didn\u2122t want to run into anybody who I used to know from olden ti me, but luckily they died. You know like, I would have never wanted to run into a police official person, who was in charge of making us go to the ghetto. The Germans gave them the orders, but somebody had to carry it through. Well, I never, never ran into them. I never saw anybody. Old friends of ours, who we really liked, we kept in touch with. And we had a very, very, very good friend\u2013 this year was really hard for us, not only that Andy died. And we had a real good friend in Hungary, who was from our hometown, who was a musicologist.

His name was George Kroo and we loved him and his wife and he loved us. And one day I got a phone call from his daughter that his father died, he had a heart attack, at work. So Sandy went to Hungary to his funeral. He was married to a non-Jewish girl, but we loved them dearly. So, I never even want to go on any trips. And we had another good friend in Washington, D.C., who was George\u2122s frie nd, our friend, he just died. And had cancer.

There is a beautiful cemetery here, it\u2122s Cave Hill Cemetery. And I didn\u2122t know that Jewish people can be buried there. But it\u2122s a beautiful place. In Spri ng it is beautiful, in Fall it\u2122s beautiful. There is a lake, a lot of sculptures all over. And it\u2122s just that people come and visit without visiting any graves. And I\u2122ve heard that Temple Shalom ha s a lot. When I heard that, I figured, well Jews must be\u2013 and then I had some friends whose husbands are buried there.

And we went out to the cemetery and we did a private funeral for him with Rabbi Miles.

And we ordered a marker and that\u2122s there. Now, in fact, when Robert was home at Fourth of July weekend, we went out there, and he looked at it.

And they asked me questions, but it USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 37 37somehow, again\u2013 I didn\u2122t cry ther e. It just was so manicured and it looked so different. And we were in Austria, last summer, with an elder hostel group and there were hardly any Jews in that group. But they had planned to go to Mauthausen. And we did that. And I saw there the gas chambers. Well of\u2013 it\u2122s hard for me to expl ain it. It\u2122s almost lik e that\u2122s not me. You know, it\u2122s almost like I couldn\u2122t have been there. I mean I know I was, but I just, that\u2122s the way, maybe, it\u2122s easier for me to deal with it. I just can\u2122t imagine how anybody can go through it and then be here to talk about it. And I\u2122m not the only one, a lot of people who\u2013 and it was, you know, the barracks, I peeked into some of the barracks. But, you know, I mean, it was so much worse than when I was there. I mean when I was there it was so horrible, that any of this thing now, which is a museum, it\u2122s just, it \u2122s hard to imagine that people really were there. But that was at the Dachau camp, where I went in. Some people, German people were sitting next to the entrance, in their houses with flowers and all. And I would walk by them and they looked maybe old. And I used to think at that time, I wonde r what they knew. How much they knew? Did they know what\u2122s going on in that camp? Stuff like that goes through my mind all the time, even now. And Sandy gets very\u2013 if he runs into somebody who\u2122s old and maybe it would be a German, then he would never trust them. He would think he might ha ve been a Nazi or whatever, you know. So, you never can get that out of your system.

That I think there ought to be a way of people to know what happened really, after we die. Because there are not that many people left who survived it, slowly. I\u2122m seventy-seven years old and young people were killed. I\u2122m not saying in Theresienstadt or some of those places, because families were together. And a young person might live to be 90, and still\u2013 but in Auschwitz there were no kids, not one."

So, I said, \ufb01I\u2122ll be glad to,\ufb02 and for many, many weeks that we would walk, we stopped at a certain point and then they wanted to know the rest of it. So, by now it doesn\u2122t give me any problems to talk about it. When some of the schools ask me, I did. I couldn\u2122t begin to tell you now how many times I did speak in schools. Once at the Catherine Spalding College, once at St. Andrews Church and mainly then on Jewish situations, of course. And they might have a Jewish student there or not. And now, I\u2122m completely at ease wi th myself and I can talk about it. Once in a while I kind of get a lump in my throat, you know, but I can do it."

When we moved to this house, then we met more and more people and they would invite us. But we\u2122re not the type that we congregate only that they have to be Jewish. As I said, that thought, if anybody would be an anti-Semitic person, I would never want to have anything to do with them. But that\u2122s not the kind of friends we ever would have. And after, you know, I got used to the idea and everybody knows we are Jewish, I mean it\u2122s not a problem anymore. And our kids , too, they have mixture of non-Jewish friends and Jewish friends. Now, my son, Robert, in Nashvi lle, he married a Cathol ic girl. Now, he is the least. He\u2122s the one who came with me to Lo s Angeles. And he said that he learned more about Andy during that three hour memorial servi ce than he ever knew, because he was just a little boy. And then he got away, Andy got away, you know, went to college and then he moved to Cal\u2013 so, I was very, very glad that he could come with me, that he wanted to come with me. And it made a very big impression on him. We got through music or through the universities or through work, that we made friends, you know, but it\u2013. and some of them are Jewish, some of them are not Jewish. So it\u2122s\u2013 we have some ve ry, very good friends, who we still get together sometimes, have dinner out. He\u2122s almost nine ty years old.

And most of the Holocaust survivors who live in the state, live in Louisville. And I\u2122m wondering if you\u2122ve had a chance or an opportunity to travel outside of Louisville or to talk to people who have been kind of surprised, who know that you\u2122re a survivor\u2013 like for example, if you speak to school groups, have you had experiences where you\u2122ve found people, where you\u2122ve spoken to people outside of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 41 41the Louisville area, who ma ybe wouldn\u2122t have expected that ev en a Holocaust survivor lives in the state?",

And they prepare the kids, most of them. They had Holocaust pictures on the wall. They were studying it before they asked me. So they were somewhat, and then they would ask a lot of questions. And I did it once at Highland Junior High School. There were 150 kids in the group and all 150 wrote me a thank you note about it. And I have all that. I have a box this full of all that kind of thing. They, one black kid, for example, said, \ufb01Can I touch you?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Yes you can.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01At least if somebody would say sometimes that the Holocaust did not exist, because we talked about that, at least I can say yes it did. Because I touched so mebody who was part of it.\ufb02 So, it made me feel good that they were thinking about that. And they hear once in a while stories where people don\u2122t want to believe. And that\u2122s the only r eason I\u2122m doing it, because it would very much bother me. And then, you know, I was very affected by this Yugoslavia problems, too, with this Kosovo deal. Because it was so similar to what we have gone through. And there were\u2013 there again, and I don\u2122t know how you feel about it, some people who hate our president and hate the Democrats, would be very much against that he started this bombing and he started invading and going in. I had very mixed feelings toward th e end, when the bombs kept on falling and maybe innocent people were killed. That bothered me, but at the same time, I thought to myself, if anybody would have tried to do and stopped at least part of it. They would have bombed, let\u2122s see, the railroad tracks, when the train was going to Auschwitz. Not necessarily mine, but hundreds and hundreds of them. It could ha ve maybe stopped something. And nobody did anything. And therefore, because I feel that way so strongly, I was saying that they did the right thing. Although it\u2122s a very compli cated situation and it\u2122s never goi ng to be peace in that part of the world. And even my friend, Ilus, we talked on the phone once and she was upset\u0160now that surprised me\u0160over the bombing. And sh e was not, she didn\u2122t feel like I do."
