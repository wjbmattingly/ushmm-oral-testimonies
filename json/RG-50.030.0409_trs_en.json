At Columbia I worked under Professor Ishtvan Dayak, who was an east European scholar, but had excellent contacts in the former countries of the hap -- the former countries that made up the old Hapsburg monarchy. And between the Columbia University name and Dayak\u2019s contacts, it eventually opened up some doors in central and eastern Europe that might not have been opened had I stayed at Wisconsin."

This was the early 70\u2019s, in the time of d\u00e9tente, and it was very -- very important that young people study the history of this region, in fact there were national defense scholarships for study of east European languages and I obtained one for studying Romanian. But primarily I went with the idea of studying German policy in Austria and in eastern Europe and that became my field of concentration."

            "answer": "No, no, this was -- this was purely coming at it through history, and -- and frankly through military history. My family had, for the most part, had the good fortune, or perhaps the bad fortune to be the victims of pogroms or Tsarist draft notices, and fled to the New World at the beginning of this century. So with rare exceptions, particularly some cousins in Romania, who managed to survive the war in Romania, most of the family was over in the United States before World War I."

            "question": "1981. And you decided not to teach, or -- si -- wa -- I had [indecipherable] you moved into --",
            "answer": "Well that -- that -- that wasn\u2019t my decision exactly. The 70\u2019s was a very difficult time for new graduates coming out and obtaining teaching jobs. I had had a couple of the -- they call them thousand dollar courses now, at that time I think they were 500 dollar courses. I\u2019d taught a course on early modern European history, and I was scheduled to teach a course on World War IT and on eastern Europe at Columbia when I was called by a representative of the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in New York, and asked whether I would be interested in working for a short term period, gathering evidence for a case against a Nazi offender. In this particular case it was a Latvian auxiliary policeman named Boleslaus Maikovskis, who -- whose case had been publicized on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d some six months earlier, in the spring of 1978. So I was not only aware of the case, I was also -- I was also interested in the work, and should -- little anecdote that goes with that call, at the time I received the call, I was working in a fairly dead end job putting data onto computer sheets on the other side of the justice department\u2019s suit against the telephone company at that time, the AT & T, which was the telephone company at that time. And it was a pretty dead-end job and I was home sick, suffering from a kidney stone, and about ready to go to the hospital when the call came in. And I had been feeling very sorry for myself, and thinking idly that it was too bad that I was too young to have been around at the time of the Nuremberg Trials. So it was almost like a stroke of a -- a divine stroke that that call came in at that time, and when asked if I was interested in working on such a project, I said, just let me pass the kidney stone, Pll be right in for an interview."

            "num": 25,
            "question": "Le -- let me ask you a question a bit about graduate school, just t -- t-to know what the texture was at the -- at the time. Were there a lot of people studying World War II, and the Nazis and the- the Holocaust, or the structure of the Nazi regime, or were you an oddity at the time at Columbia? I mean, what -- what was it like?",
            "answer": "Columbia didn\u2019t have at that time, a specific World War II scholar. It did have a strong eastern European department, but its modern -- its eastern European modernist, Voytek Mastney, who was my professor my first year at Columbia didn\u2019t get tenure and had to leave at the end of 1972 - 1973. He went on to post-war studies in Communism. And that was the focus at Columbia University, but that doesn\u2019t mean that there weren\u2019t -- there wasn\u2019t a generation of scholars, not studying the Holocaust per se, because that was still very much a political term, and not the term of [indecipherable] for this period as yet, certainly not in academic parlance. But there were a group of scholars who had been spawned and encouraged by the availability of captured German records on microfilm at the national archives. They were first available in an easy to use format on the microfilm in the early 1960\u2019s. And this was also the time in which the originals, which had been captured by the U.S. army, were returned to the Federal Republic of Germany in the mid-60\u2019s, according to treaty. And we -- I was sort of at the tail end of that generation of young scholars who were interested in the Nazi regime, and interested in the organizations of the Nazi regime, and also fascinated with the personnel files of the individuals, fascinated with the ideas of -- of motivate -- what made these people tick, and how did they operate as individuals and as an organization. And that spawned my interest in the SS, and my interest in doing a biography."

Hillberg had actually worked with the captured German records, analyzed as a document analyst in the late 40\u2019s and early 50\u2019s, and wrote his book based on that documentation before it was microfilmed, and you can tell that from the citations in his book, he still has the original file folder numbers there. And his book first came out in 1961 and by the time I was ready to get serious when I started college in \u201968, a paperback version was out, and easily available even to a poor graduate student."

And he told me a little bit about the Maikovskis case, and about the problems with the Maikovskis case, and he explained to me that the members of the special litigation unit in Washington, D.C., which had been formed the year earlier, 1977, and which had recently, in the spring of 1978 expanded to a staff of approximately four lawyers, two paralegals and one part- time historian, needed someone who was based in New York, who could conduct research in the archives in New York, the main one of which was the Yiddish institute for Jewish research, which at that time was located on the corner of East 81\u2018 Street, and I believe it was Fifth Avenue."

And he was brought in by the criminal division to reorganize the special litigation unit, expand its staff, and deploy it effectively as a central agency to investigate and if necessary litigate all of the Nazi offender cases in the United States. Rockler was the director from September -- I\u2019m sorry, he was the director from May 1979 until approximately March 1980. I believe it was a nine month detail, or a 10 month detail. And Ryan was brought on as the deputy sometime in -- he was there when I moved down to Washington, so it must have been sometime in 1979.

They asked me to find evidence about this case, and I wasn\u2019t quite sure what they wanted me to do either, so I did -- what I did know how to do was go to then -- go to the published records, the Nuremberg trial records, and put together, I think it was about a 10 or a 15 or 20 page essay on the Latvian auxiliary police in -- in -- under German occupation in 1941. Maikovskis was accused of having been a precinct chief in an eastern region of Latvia, around Rezekne, Rossitten in German. And he had been accused of participating in killings of local Jews in the summer and autumn of 1941. And I went to some of the basic sources, there\u2019s a lengthy Nuremberg document which was written by the commander of the security police, in SD in the Baltic States, the former Einsatzgruppen chief, Walter Stahlecker, which was a lengthy report of about, oh, 250 pages dealing with the German occupation of the Baltic States and the operations of the police, in particular the auxiliary police. We also had in New York, copies of the Einsatzgruppen reports, which were on microfilm at the time, and I reviewed those and gathered the material that were relevant to Latvian auxiliary police killings of Jews and others in Latvia in the summer of 1941, and I put it together in a basic historical essay that I would write as a college paper at that time. This was before I had the PhD., and in fact it was at the time when I was writing the PhD."

            "answer": "And the attorney was pleasantly surprised, and particularly by the speed in which it was gathered. It wasn\u2019t such a big thing to a historian, but it was obviously something that was very helpful to the attorney. And the reason for that was that the case had run into a snag. The original allegations had come from witnesses, primarily Israeli witnesses, who had Maikovskis little -- literally in every location in Latvia, killing people. And the U.S. attorneys had gone over to Latvia to take depositions of former Soviet -- Soviet Latvian citizens who had been Maikovskis\u2019s comrades, and who placed Maikovskis solely in one area of Latvia, in southeastern Latvia by Rezekne. And the judge in the case was extremely hostile to the idea of deporting someone for Nazi offenses. Not -- and th-th-there\u2019s no reason to believe that he was sympathetic to the Nazis, he just didn\u2019t like the idea of throwing someone out of the United States on the basis of old evidence and evidence that had came in part from the Soviet Union. And the judges hostility made it difficult for the attorneys to use the witness evidence, which, as it turned out, was a good thing for the Maikovskis case because the government eventually withdrew the charges against Maikovskis in the complaint, in -- in the order to show cause, Maikovskis was a alien, he wasn\u2019t a citizen. The -- the charges that placed Maikovskis anywhere outside of Rezekne were withdrawn, and the case then focused solely on what was going on in Rezekne. And with a combination of documents in U.S. archives, which gave the general picture of what was going on in the Soviet -- in -- in -- in German occupied Latvia, in that region, and the statements, the depositions, complete with cross examination of Soviet witnesses -- that is Soviet citizens who had been comrades of Maikovskis, who described from their eyewitness point of view what had happened, enabled us to secure Maikovskis\u2019s order of deportation. If I remember correctly, we lost -- the judge was hostile enough to rule against us, but we won on appeal, at the board of immigration appeals. And Maikovskis eventually fled to West Germany before he was actually deported."

            "question": "The -- this particular process, to not have it be a criminal prosecution, is this because of something in international law, or was this a decision the United States government made, not to make this a criminal proceeding, but rather to talk about willful misrepresentation, that someone misrepresented who they were, and we wouldn\u2019t have let them into the country before. Why not try these people for what they actually did?",
            "answer": "I think there were a lot of factors involved in that. One clearly was, unlike the -- the Great Britain, which decided to go the criminal route, the Australians and the brit -- and the Canadians also decided, with total lack of success, to go the criminal proceedings route. The United States had a Constitution of 200 years, and to create a criminal jurisdiction for trying these cases in the United States, under criminal procedures would -- was, as I understand it, possible, but would have involved considerable difficulty, and considerable delay in setting up the apparatus. It also would have held the government to an extremely strict standard, as it did in the cases of Australia, Great Britain and Canada, of proving potentially, an individual case of murder. The -- on the other hand, the immigration procedures were in place, and had been in place, particularly since many of the offenders had come in under the Displaced Persons Act, and the Refugee Relief Act of the -- the -- the legislation that was extant in the late 40\u2019s and early 50\u2019s. And there was legislation on the books already that if these applicants for immigration, and later for naturalization gave willful, false statements about their past, that they could be denaturalized, and ultimately deported. They would return to their pre-immigration status. That 1s, as an alien, which now the truth was known, was ineligible to enter the United States. And an ineligible alien face -- who is in the United States, faces deportation. U.S. immigration law, sometimes for many of the wrong reasons, is extremely harsh, and does not make many exceptions. And it was evidently decided -- this is not first-hand knowledge of -- of mine, it was evidently decided that this would be an appropriate process to deal with the issue of Nazi offenders living in the United States. It was hoped, I think initially, that for many of these individuals, that the nations where they had committed their offenses, would request their extradition. And in fact, there was some precedent for that. There was an outstanding request on the part of the former Yugoslav government, for the former Croat Minister of the Interior, Andrea Artukovich, since the early 50\u2019s. And in 1972, the West German government requested and obtained the extradition of a Long Island housewife named Hermine Braunsteiner-Ryan, who had been a camp guard at the Lublin Majdanek concentration camp, and who had evaded justice afterwards, married an American serviceman, and had come over to live in the United States, and who was sort of the epitome of the quiet neighbor that Allan Ryan tried to reflect in the title of his book in 1983."

The Soviet Union was often prepared to take people back in the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s, but the United States government was not prepared at that time to send individuals back to the Soviet Union."

            "answer": "Holzman amendment is passed, if I\u2019m correct -- if I\u2019m correct, it was passed in -- by Congress in 1978, and ratified in 1980. So it became effective in 1980. It really goes back to United States immigration policy at the end of World War II. The United States clearly saw that it had been remiss -- the United States government at the time, and -- and -- and this was backed by popular support, that it had been remiss in granting sanctuary to refugees prior to World War II, and there was a concerted effort to provide special immigration legislation for refugees after World War II, that would exceed the narrowly restricted quotas which developed out of the 1924 Immigration and Naturalization Act. And the first of these special -- first of two -- actually three special laws, was the Displaced Persons Act, which was passed in 1948, and took effect from 1948 until the last day of 1952. And it created a separate category, over and above the quotas, of displaced persons who were eligible beyond the quotas to receive visas to immigrate to the United States. And if memory serves me correct, some 400,000 people -- I think just under 400,000 people immigrated to the United States under the Displaced Persons Act from various countries in Europe. There were -- the Displaced Persons Act also provided for the establishment of a DP commission, which operated in Europe and administered displaced person\u2019s camps to provide sanctuary for survivors of the Holocaust, refugees from Communist takeovers in eastern Europe, and displaced persons uprooted by the Nazis during their occupation of eastern Europe who could -- could not, or would not be repatriated, to give them a place where they could find shelter and food, and in the case of kids, find some education and training, while they awaited the completion of the application process for a visa. When the Displaced Persons Act expired, the U.S. Congress, and again, backed by considerable public support, and this was -- keep in mind this was the time of the McCarthy era, despite the concerns with Communism, a refugee relief act was passed, which permitted further refugees, some of those who were ineligible under the Displaced Persons Act, to come to the United States on special visas that went over and beyond the numbers and the quotas. And these visas, the last big blup of visas, came in December 1956, and spilled over to January 1957 to accommodate the refugees from Hungary, from the Hungarian revolution of 1956. Now each of these decrees, each of these laws, as well as a 1945 regulation, if I remember correctly, there were increasingly less strict restrictions on eligibility to those who were either German, or received some benefit from the Nazi regime, or had collaborated with the Nazi regime. There was a regulation -- a -- a State Department regulation already in 1945, barring Nazi collaborators from coming into the United States. The Displaced Persons Act had fairly stringent restrictions on Nazi collaborators, those who assisted in persecution on the basis of race, religion and national origin, from entering the United States. The Refugee Relief Act also had similar, except somewhat vaguer language, but still had language that excluded persons who personally participated in persecution from entering the United States. Now, initially, as an example of how the legislation was relaxed in this aspect 1s the following; under the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, SS membership rendered one ineligible from entering the United States, regardless of what you had done in the SS -- what -- what an individual had done as a member of the SS. Membership in the SS alone, was enough to exclude from the United States. In -- under the amendment of 1950, which mems -- mere membership in the SS was no longer sufficient to exclude. One had to, as a member of the SS, have participated in persecution. The amendment in 1950 also allowed for nationals of, for instance, the Baltic States to enter as displaced persons, even if they had served in collaborative units, like the Latvian legion of the Waffen SS. Latvians could come before, through the Displaced Persons Act, but they can -- could not have been affiliated with Nazi organizations. Under the DP Act as amended, they were now no longer ineligible."

            "answer": "I-I\u2019m sure there were many factors involved. The one that comes to mind is that there was a -- a shortage of agricultural labor in the United States, and a lot of the east European refugees from Communism were farmers, and farmer\u2019s sons. And the -- and al -- and many of them were also ethnic Germans from eastern Europe. And I have no doubt that the idea of providing sanctuary to individuals who were escaping Communist regimes was a significant factor in amending the Displaced Persons Act. There was also a feeling even at the time that for those who served in combat units that were affiliated with Nazi Germany, that particularly for Ukrainians, for members of the Baltic states, whose annexation by the Soviet Union the United States never recognized, that these people had had very bad choices, and that the one that they chose was only marginally less worse than the -- the other that was available to them. And so I think 1 -- th -- a combination of factors led to the amendment of the Displaced Persons Act, and also led to the -- the slight differences in the Refugee Relief Act."

            "num": 65,
            "question": "And so then what is the next change that happens? Is it --",
            "answer": "After -- after the Refugee Relief Act expired, at the end of -- in 1952, and a new Immigration and Naturalization Act had been passed, which was slightly less restrictive, and here I\u2019m -- here I\u2019m speaking off the top of my head -- slightly less restrictive than the \u201824 act, but it was a quota act again. And that came back into force, and remained in force until 1986 or \u201996, the new immigration act -- the new immigration act, I think it was 1996, replaced the \u201952 act. Under these acts, all of these acts, the \u00b052 act in particular, but also the other special immigration legislation, that an individual who was ordered deported, could apply for what was called discretionary relief, for a number of reasons, whether they\u2019ve been a good citizen, and they were -- when they - while they lived in the United States, if their wi -- were married to U.S. citizens, if they had children who were U.S. citizens, if they had close relatives who were dependent on them who were U.S. citizens. And another very important and applicable one in these cases, if by deportation to the country from whence they came, they would be subjected to political persecution. And this was a particularly applicable part of the statute for the Communist regimes, and was applied in the case of the former Croat Minister of the Interior, Andrea Artukovich who came in the -- into the United States under a false name, was clearly involved in persecution. He came even before the DP act, he came under the 1924 act, I believe. And he was actually ordered deported in 1953 at the conclusion of a proceeding, but the order of deportation was stayed because he was successfully able to argue that he would be persecuted in a Communist Yugoslavia, and would not get a fair trial. And this very much stems from the -- the -- the Cold War atmosphere of the time, and this was an atmosphere that continued affecting the few cases that actually were prosecuted, or were litigated during the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s, until the Vietnam era."

And so this there -- this therefore opened the door for an actual result to these cases, you didn\u2019t have to go through the litigation only to find that the individual could apply for and get discretionary relief, either because his children were U.S. citizens, or because he could claim political persecution from a Communist country. Now, did it mean that we were -- we, the U.S. government were willing to deport these people just to any country, as a practice? Not yet, but at least legally the possibility was there to obtain an order of deportation and actually carry it out."

            "answer": "Again, I think it was a combination of factors. Clearly important was the precedent of the Braunsteiner-Ryan case in 1972, which sparked questions about how many other Nazi criminals were living in our midst, so to speak. And that created a certain degree of public pressure, in part from Jewish groups, and survivor groups, which unlike 1945 - 1950, where they were immigrants with no -- no confidence to say what they wanted, and no strong desire to relive the immediate past as opposed to dealing with creating a new life and a future, were now established U.S. citizens, quite conscious and aware of their rights to lobby congressmen, to get some results on this. A second key factor was the development of a -- the process of d\u00e9tente between the United States and the Soviet Union. The year that Braunsteiner-Ryan was extradited, 1972, was also the year that President Nixon visited Moscow and ushered in the era of d\u00e9tente, which lasted more or less until the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. This was also a time at which we in the United States, and to a greater degree, prosecutors in West Germany were beginning to see glimpses of the types of usable evidence, credible evidence that existed behind the iron curtain. In the 50\u2019s this stuff just was not available in any way. In the 60\u2019s, particularly in the early 60\u2019s, trickles of documentary material captured by the Red army, came into the public domain through west German trials, and also through Soviet propaganda pamphlets in the late 60\u2019s and early 70\u2019s, denouncing the western powers for harboring Nazi criminals. Now the pamphlets were -- were -- were nonsense, and -- and often many of the statements in the pamphlets were nonsense, as well as the interpretations. But the documents that were photocopied, if genuine, and one couldn\u2019t tell if they were genuine unless they subjected -- subjected them to careful forensic testing, were not only interesting in themselves, but fascinating as examples of the type of material that had survived the war, and that was in Soviet hands. One of the key driving forces behind the office of special investigation\u2019s success, was an early agreement 1n 1980 with the Soviet Union to take videotaped depositions from Soviet citizens, all of whom were comrades of the defendants in the United States, and of whom, while it might be questioned what kinds of pressures they were in the Soviet Union, it couldn\u2019t be questioned that they knew the defendants involved, whereas with the survivor witnesses, defense attorneys could raise questions as to how they could possibly know that this was the man who did this, that and the other thing. The comrades who worked with them on a daily basis, and who may have known them from their hometowns couldn\u2019t be questioned. They -- their knowledge of the defendants as members of these units was much more credible, even if it was coming from behind the Iron Curtain. We also were unable at that time to get unrestricted access to Soviet records, but we were able to get access to copies of documentation, at least pertaining to our defendants at that time, and in response to the general objection of the defense that these documents were always forged by the Soviet Union, the Soviet authorities quickly understood that in order for the United States government to be credible, that they would have to fork over the originals. And this started already in 1980 - 1981, where the Soviet authorities would have the original document sent to the Soviet embassy or Soviet consulate, depending on where the trial was taking place, in the United States, where the document could then be examined by the government\u2019s forensics examiners for handwriting, for paper, for typing quality, for signatures. And also by teams hired by the defense. And at no time did the Soviets ever represent to OSI that a document was genuine when it was not genuine."

And the Supreme Court ruled that by the very daily duties of a concentration camp guard, even if he did nothing personally against a prisoner; never shot a prisoner, never beat a prisoner, never so much as looked at a prisoner, by standing there on the perimeter of the camp with a rifle in his hand, he is acting as a deterrent fra -- for the prisoners from escaping, and that this was participation in persecution. So there were certain units that if you could prove, if we the U.S. government could prove that the individual was a member of that unit, and carried out the normal daily routine of that unit, we would -- that -- that person could be proven, if we could prove those facts, a judge could make a finding that that person participated in persecution. Or that that person was a -- a person of bad moral character because he participated in persecution."

Now had the United States gone the criminal route, it\u2019s hard to know what would have happened, and it\u2019s a route not taken, but the standard of evidence would have been beyond a reasonable doubt, whereas the standard of evidence in the civil cases was clear and convincing. Judges often held the United States government fairly close to a beyond a reasonable doubt, but we could make this culpability as a reflection of membership, or membership being culpability, membership in an organization that did as its daily business the persecution of individuals on the basis of race, religion, national origin and political opinion. That we could do.

And we -- we had roughly, if I remember correctly, around 20 attorneys, around 10 or 15 investigators and then the remaining 10 or 15 were a combination of historians, paralegals and other support staff. And at the time, Rockler, Walter Rockler, who was the first director of the OSI, gathered together a number of attorneys, private -- from private practice or other government agencies, and a number of investigators, almost all from other federal agencies ranging from the custom service to state department security to the INS for that matter.

And in order to -- they were like little biographies, and I ha -- of course, had written a biography for my dissertation, and it was a biography of an individual, the chief of the Nazi security police SD, Ernst Karltenbrunner, who had left very little of himself behind. And I had to go at his biography by dealing with the organizations to which he belonged, and by dealing with the individuals with whom he associated. And in many ways, OSI, on a much lower level, dealt with that type of investigative process. And so what the historians started to do, and now again my colleague, my former colleague David Marlowe and I talked about this quite a bit when we were both at OSI as young historians, what we started to do was to gather documentation, primary source documentation. We understood, as historians what kinds of documentation bore what weight of reliability. We\u2019d gather documentation on the institutions that were relevant to the charges in the complaint. We\u2019d gather information on the individual, but we\u2019d also gather information on the comrades of the individuals. And this served two purposes. On the one hand we wanted to talk to those comrades if they were still alive, because they could tell us things that the victims of the defendant couldn\u2019t, and they could also tell us about the daily routine, which th -- which information the defendant was not going to give us. We couldn\u2019t get it from any other source other than the hints that were left in the documentation. And for a second reason is that the personnel material, and the administrative material of the organization that these people belonged to, whether it was a concentration camp, or a security police unit, or an auxiliary police unit, gave us a fairly accurate, and fairly reliable picture of what the daily life of this defendant was, so that an expert witness could get up in front of a judge and say with complete conviction that on a daily basis, on a normal day, so and so rotated into these particular guard assignments, and this was part of his daily duty. Now, maybe he didn\u2019t do it on this day or that day, but if you take a period of time, whether it was a week or three months, he was doing it in this order at least some time, and that this was part of the daily routine, the standard operating procedure of this particular unit in this ti -- particular place. And so in gathering this type of documentation, we were able to put together cases that were based on paper."

The attorneys and the investigators were often used to working primarily with live bodies, with witnesses, whether it was an expert witness, an expert historical witness, and expert forensic technician, a survivor witness, even a -- a perpetrator witness. But a live body who could say what happened, meaning more than the paper documentation. And because of some of the problems with the early witness statements, particularly survivor statements, we came to rely on in part, I think, because the -- of the historians work, more solidly on the documentation and the witnesses, particularly the survivor witnesses became much more important to show to the judge what it was the victims underwent as a result of the defendants participation, assistance or advocation in persecution. And it changed remo -- this was something that historians and attorneys in particular, and invest -- investigators to a certain degree, sort of worked towards without consciously saying this is how we\u2019re going to change it, this was just -- it just became a -a--] won\u2019t say instinctual dynamic, but a professional dynamic in that the historians wanted to know everything they could about the way a place operated, and how the people operated within a place. And the attorneys and the investigators wanted to win cases. And the combination of those two elements produced cases that we could put on that were based primarily on paper, that went through an expert historical witness. But the witness\u2019s testimony alone was usually not enough. We tried as much as possible to have the elements of the expert witness testimony backed at every point by a specific piece of paper that the judge could read and say yes, I can see why he comes to that opinion. So that the judge, if the judge chose, could go back and pick apart the component parts of the expert\u2019s testimony. And that was the idea that we developed. And by we, I say both historians and attorneys working together, that we developed, in terms of putting together a case that we felt would be as airtight as possible."

            "answer": "That\u2019s a good question. Yet -- 1-in the early days, in -- in some of the more famous cases that came about in this way, it could come either from rumors from the old country, like Trifa was -- charges surfaced against Trifa both from the ra -- Communist Romanian regime, but also from Romanian \u00e9migr\u00e9s from the moment he stepped off the boat as a displaced person in 1950. Andrea Artukovich was uncovered by, I believe, I -- I can\u2019t remember, but I think he was actually seen and denounced by someone. There were people who would pick up on rumors. The Soviets would float pamphlet literature in the United States denouncing this person or that person. Maikovskis was denounced in the early 60\u2019s, after having been tried and sentenced to death in absentia, in a typical Soviet style trial in the early 1960\u2019s. And the response of the early authorities in the seven -- in the early 70\u2019s was to follow these leads and be reactive to what was coming in from the outside. When the OSI hired full-time historians to work on the cases that were floating around, and the OSI inherited 300 -- approximately 350 from the INS, many of which had been kicking around since the 50\u2019s and the 60\u2019s uninvestigated, particularly after the Artukovich fiasco in the mid-50\u2019s. The historians, in their search for documentation relating to the place or places where the defendants served, and relating to the units in which the defendants served, came across rosters of individuals, many of them with birthdates and birthplaces. And early on, beginning even in 1980, the investigators were running lists -- post-war lists developed by American authorities of war crime suspects through the Immigration and Naturalization Service to see whether matches had taken place, or whether there were hits, we called them hits. That the indi -- an individual of the same name, and same birth year at least, and it\u2019s o-often the same birthdate, of this war crime suspect had actually entered the United States on such and such a date. Once we started collecting rosters, this became a -- a -- a fairly large operation, and we were the first and only unit outside of the federal republic of Germany, and the Soviet Union to investigate in this way. And so we began, I would say, certainly by 1982 - 1983, 95 percent if not better of our cases originated in this way. The historians would gather rosters in the course of one a -- investigation, in order to identify other members of that unit, 1n part as potential sources for witnesses, and in part as potential evidence for that particular investigation. And then would run those names through the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to determine whether these people came to the United States. And if we could determine whether they came to the United States then th-they either became witnesses themselves that we wanted to talk to about their comrades, or they became -- and in most cases they did become subjects."

These included the Berlin document center, and the German armed forces information agency, as well as regional German police agencies. Now, most of these people, most of the OSI subjects, 90 percent if not better, were from eastern Europe and most of them were small fry, and most of them were either non-German, or were ethnic Germans from the east.

            "answer": "With Operation Paper Clip, we actually did have one case involving an Operation Paper Clip subject, Arthur Rudolf, whom we did end up -- he denaturalized himself essentially, by default. The difference with Operation Paper Clip, and the problem with Operation Paper Clip for the -- for proc -- litigation in this context was that these individuals were brought specifically to the United States, not despite what they\u2019d done, but because of what they\u2019d done. And this, if you go back to the context of that time, the purpose of bringing them to the United States was number one, to obtain whatever missile expertise they might have, and also to deprive the Soviet Union of that missile expertise. Which, whatever the morality of the situation 1s, looking back at it at that time, it was not an unreasonable decision given the national security interests at the time. This, obviously, did present a problem in the 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s when we were looking into these investigations, because one could not say that the person gave false information. Another issue that was problematic is that many of these people had, in the broader context, a rather marginal connection with the persecution. The connection was generally at its worst responsibility for forced laborers, perhaps denouncing a forced laborer for -- for not working hard enough, as a result of which that forced laborer would be sent to a concentration camp, or sent to a worse concentration camp, or a worst case scenario, executed. This was clearly something that was not a priority for U.S. officials in the 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s when they were trying people, they were trying people who were shooting people. They were trying people who were direct, hands-on killers, and they had plenty of them. By the 1980\u2019s, because the big fry were either already tried, or die - had died, there was a broader and more intensive public and legal concentration on different types of connections with Nazi crimes, and the connection with forced labor was clearly one of those. The ro -- for the roc -- for the majority of the rocket scientists, their connection with the forced labor was in comparison to that of a concentration camp guard, or a police official, relatively marginal. So the cases were that much tougher to prove, even without the problem of why the men were brought in."

            "question": "Okay. So now you got a case. Now what happens? Is there a team and you sit around and you strategize, Peter, you have to do this, we need this from you. Or do you just get the case and then you all go off in your own separate directions? What happens?",
            "answer": "No, it\u2019s -- it -- 1t -- it\u2019s much more systematic than that. Cases are developed through the OSI research and development department. This is a department that grew out of the investigative wing of the unit in the mid-1980\u2019s, and it is responsible for the -- it -- 1-1t -- 1t functions among many other things, as a transmission belt for these names that are dredged up by the historians, based on the original documentation to and from the INS. If a hit occurs where a person of the same name and same birthdate as someone who is a suspect of being a member of a unit involved in Nazi offenses, has also entered the United States, the research and development unit also takes several other steps to determine whether the person is still in the United States, whether the person is still alive, and whether the person is in good health. And also to make certain that the individual who resides in the United States is identical with the individual whose name a-appears on the roster that -- that was originated in the Nazi era. Once all of those bases are covered, so to speak, then the research and development -- the chief of the research and development, I think her -- her name is Elizabeth White, we had Dr. Black and Dr. White, and she then opens a case, gives it an OSI number and it becomes an investigation. The case is then assigned to an attorney and to a historian, and to a paralegal. And together the historian does the investigations, and OSI has some minimal investigative personnel to locate people, locate witnesses, locate files from federal agencies. But the historian does the investigation, works at the investigation to a point where the attorneys consider it ready for what we call a pre-filing interview. Cause we assume that all defendants are innocent until proven guilty, and that there could be some explanation for whatever it is we\u2019ve put together. We obviously, if we get to the point where we want to talk to someone, we obviously feel that we have a -- a good -- we being the U.S. government, feels that we have a good case, that we can litigate if necessary, but there\u2019s always a possibility that there\u2019s a reasonable explanation for the documentation that we find in our hands. And so we usually attempt to interview the subject of the OSI investigation prior to filing a case. And as citizens -- if they\u2019re citizens, the subject can refuse to speak to us. Doesn\u2019t have to come. It\u2019s a civil case, the subject does not have to appear. If the subject is an alien, the subject must appear, but he does not have to say anything to us, other than name, rank and serial number, if he wants. Based on that pre-filing interview, depending on what the unit gets, and depending on what that means for the case, the direction of OSI makes a determination of whether a case, a complaint, or an order to show cause should be filed. And then once that determination is made, the -- the documentation is drafted, and a case is filed in court."

            "question": "Okay.",
            "answer": "But I -- I didn\u2019t -- I -- I feel I should explain why that tome is so big. It has to do with some of the specifics of the Trifa case. Trifa was not a case which was developed by OSI. It was a case that was developed through denunciation. And Trifa in his defense was able to make statements that were half-truths, that required a significant amount of documentation to develop an understanding among the attorneys of what the actual truth was. Trifa, for example, was able to say he was incarcerated in a concentration camp during the war. And what did that mean? He was able to say that the Romanian Iron Guard was anti-German. What did that mean? He could say that the Germans didn\u2019t trust the Iron Guard. What did that -- all of those things were -- were truth, but they weren\u2019t the whole truth. And the whole truth was dependent on a rather acute analysis of what the documentation was, what the conditions were like for the Iron Guards when they were in German captivity. It was clear from the documentation. But it took 40 pages of that particular part of the case to explain to the prosecuting attorneys, and also -- who would then explain it to the judge, through the expert witness, of what exactly was the nature of the persecution of Trifa. The same is true for the Iron Guards anti-German behavior, or the Iron Guards rebellion against the Fascist Romanian military dictatorship which was backed by the Germans. And for Trifa\u2019s own particular role in persecution, which was -- had to be shifted from the original emphasis on physical mistreatment of individuals, which came from witnesses, many of whom didn\u2019t, as it turned out, pan out, to a more -- persecution based more on advocation, particularly within the student rubric, and student organizations of exclusion and discrimination against Jews and Gypsies and Greeks in Romania. And also towards a print advocation of -- with intent to instill hatred of these minority groups, and to help to create an atmosphere in which the authorities could, with reasonable support from the general population, engage in physical persecution of these individuals. And if you\u2019ll notice in that particular tome at the end of each section, there is a contrast between Trifa\u2019s statements, and what evidence exists, based on the historical context in the chapters, that would contradict what Trifa -- Trifa\u2019s version of events. And that was an unusual case."

And I -- I don\u2019t remember exactly which year we -- the courts began to require these reports, but I think it was in the early 90\u2019s. A much better example is the Schellong report, Conrad Schellong, who was a -- who was a concentration camp guard and security officer at Dachau in the years before the war, and I can tell you now that someone in OSI when I first at -- was assigned to the case was disappointed that he was only there before the war, and even said something to the effect, well before the war they were just like prisons, weren\u2019t they? And that signaled to me as a historian that even before we went outside to deal with judges and defense attorneys, we had to lay a context for what Dachau was, and a context to prove, in a sense, that the people who were in Dachau, despite Nazi euphemisms and misstatements about who they were and why they were there, were in that camp for reasons of race, religion, national origin and political opinion --"

            "question": "Right.",
            "answer": "-- and were being persecuted for those reasons. And a key hooker to that was dealing with the instrument, the legal police instrument of schutzhaft, or protective detention is the loose translation. And by dealing with the regulations of protective detention, which was imposed by the Gestapo outside the concentration camp, and had little to do with the individual\u2019s sojourn within the camp, except to bring him or her in, or bring him or her out if he or she managed to survive. But the schutzhaft provided the proof that the people who were in that camp were in that camp because of their race, because they were Jewish in 1938, because of their national origin, because of their religious convictions, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, or because of their political opinion; Socialists, Communists and -- and what have you. And that was quite clearly expressed in schutzhaft orders and in the discussion of what schutzhaft was and how schutzhaft was supposed to be applied in the documentation of the Gestapo, of the Reich Ministry of the Interior, and of the concentration camp commandants themselves. And so we -- we as historians were responsible for putting together a context of how the prisoners came into the concentration camp, by what pseudo-legal means they came into the concentration camp, of how the guards were recruited, of what their duties were, and of how their daily duties involved keeping these people in a place where they were being persecuted on the basis of race, religion and so forth. And through that, if we could prove all of those facts, and we could prove that the defendant was a member of this unit, then we could prove -- then -- then a judge could reach a finding that this individual persecuted, or assisted -- participated in persecution. And the purpose in writing a report, and people always used to joke about my long reports -- the purpose of writing the report was not only to inform the attorneys, but also to solidify in the mind of the historian, what the framework of this inquiry was going to be, and so that the historian could be sure that all relevant documentation, some of it -- some of which was often obscure and by itself meaningless, how it fit in. And y -- we could use the report even though we didn\u2019t show the reports to the expert witnesses until the courts began to require us to provide an expert witness report, we didn\u2019t show- these were work product. But we would use the framework established by that report to work out the testimony of the expert witness, and then test it against the expert witnesses, cause after all, he was an independent individual, or she -- a-and I think most of our expert witnesses were male."

Actually, I was not the first assigned to the Trifa case, it had pre- dated OSI, and in fact pre-dated the SLU, the Special Litigation Unit in the INS, had actually been filed in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Detroit, I believe it was, in 1975. Some of the early research for the SLU, in records both in the national archives and in Romania, were done by none other than Paul Shapiro, who worked as a contractor for the SLU for a short time in \u201978 - \u00b079. I\u2019m -- maybe \u201977 - \u201978. When I was hired and brought down to Washington, I had a look at the existing evidence, and there was still a s -- a number of gaps that needed to be filled at that point, primarily from material that was held at the United States National Archives, and primarily from captured German records, SS records, and German foreign office records. And what I did was to gather the rest of that material and pull that material, together with the material that had been gathered from Romania, and with some newer material that had been gathered from the Library of Congress, which had the monetoral officiale, which was the legal gazette of the Antonescu regime in Romania. And -- cause we weren\u2019t at war with Romania during the period that the Iron Guard was in power in the autumn and winter of 1940 and 1941. And I integrated the information from these various sources, into a narrative that was broken down into the topics that were relevant to our -- the components of our complaint and the defenses that Trifa had made against the charges of the government."

We could argue -- here\u2019s an example, I -- I don\u2019t remember if this exactly was in my mind at the time, or this be -- was an issue at the trial, but Trifa claimed that he was persecuted by the Nazis, that he was a concentration camp prisoner. Our direct examination involved his sojourn with the other Iron Guard leaders in the Birkenbrook SS house, where -- from where he had a special vacation for his stomach ulcers, where he was at spas, and going to movies, and writing home about -- home to his buddies at Birkenbrook about his stomach illnesses, and his medicines, and what the weather was like, not -- not exactly the regular concentration camp prisoner\u2019s life."

At the behest of the foreign ministry, the SS did put the -- the Iron Guard leaders in a concentration camp, I believe it was at Buchenwald, but I can\u2019t remember where -- which camp at the moment. I think Seymour went to Sachsenhausen and the rest of them went to Buchenwald. But even here, and this was the issue that was brought up for rebuttal; if he says, oh I was in a concentration camp, and I was treated poorly, even here there is evidence that the Iron Guard leaders were clearly prominent persons, kept in a separate compound, they had a radio they could listen to, and they even had a -- a -- Jehovah\u2019s Witness as a -- as a-- a person who would clean their -- their rooms, and what have you. Again, it was not the typical concentration camp existence, and they were clearly not in there because of Nazi persecution of their politics, they were in there because the Nazis needed to keep tabs on them for foreign policy reasons, and they also wanted to keep them in reserve in the event that the Antonescu regime ever tried to desert the axis, as it did in 1944. So it was that type of evidence that I felt, and other historians working on their cases felt that the attorneys ought to have, either for rebuttal purposes, or for their general background. And in some cases it was information that the expert witness might not have, but might be able to evaluate in a useful way, to frame his or her testimony."

            "answer": "-- it would be an ongoing conversation that we would have, and it would often be a conversation that we would have in the context of selecking -- selecting specific documents, and giving them priority as to how we ought to use them. As I remember it, in our cases, in the cases I worked on, there were four levels of priority. We selected documents that we were definitely going to introduce as evidence on direct examination, through the vehicle of the expert witness. And this involved a whole procedure of making sure that they were properly translated, making sure that they were properly certified as to the chain of custody, which was particularly for materials from the Soviet Union, and the eastern bloc, these were -- this could be a very, very complicated process. The second level required similar preparation because these were documents that were selected to be used if necessary to rebut possible defenses, or documentation submitted in support of possible defenses. So in other words, you had to have these documents ready as if you wanted to move them into evidence, whether you moved them into evidence or not. But a decision to move them into evidence would be made, perhaps very close to trial, or maybe during the trial itself. The third level of priority were those documents that we felt that the expert witness should see. That we would not use them as evidence, they were not appropriate as evidence, either because they were not relevant, or because, for instance, they involved a witness statement where the witness was no longer alive and couldn\u2019t be cross examined, and it was not an old enough document to come in under an ancient documents exception to the hearsay rule. Or 1t was simply general background and general context that the expert witness should either see for the first time, or refresh his memory and have it as part of the context of the case, but it was not necessary to introduce as evidence. It was something that the expert could talk about without having to document it. An example of that might be -- an example of that might be a report about a specific event that occurred in 1941, that was written in 1944, either by the government that perpetrated the event, or that was presiding over the event, or by the successor government. Was something that the expert probably should be aware of, but it was not something that was appropriate to use as evidence. And then the fourth rung were those documents that were either exonerating, or in some way that could potentially adversely affect the case, so that the expert witness would have an opportunity to know what they were, and to reconcile them with the theory of the case as developed through this cooperation between the expert witness and the prosecution team."

And I believe to remember that the -- the year -- I think there\u2019s a year limit, and there is a requirement that the document is not created in the interests of the present proceeding. So in other words, it has to be old enough, first of all, so that there\u2019s no shadow of a doubt as to whether the document was created for this proceeding. And by the same token, it had to be totally d -- think of a good word -- totally de- linked from the existing proceeding, cause technically even an order, written right prior to an operation, is a hearsay document. The document only says what it says, it\u2019s not proof that the order was carried out, it\u2019s not -- the signature isn\u2019t proof that the person who signed it actually signed it, unless you test the handwriting, nor 1s it proof that the person who actually signed it read it, and intended that order to be -- to be implemented. But the expert witness could argue on the basis of his experience, on the basis of his having seen many similar documents, that this was a normal document of the type created by this type of agency in this type of situation. And that\u2019s how this document came to be. And this went for post-war interrogation protocols as well, which were na -- not even word for word testimony. They were summaries that were written by police or prosecutors of what the witness said, and then the witness later signed it, which is the normal way of procedure in -- in continental law. There\u2019s no word for word witness testimony in a pre- trial interrogation. The witness talks, the prosecutor or police interrogator summarizes it, types it up, and the witness is -- 1s -- reads it and then either signs to 1t or makes whatever changes the witness deems are a-appropriate and accurate."

            "answer": "-- the expert offers evidence -- excuse me -- on what the unit did, o-on the big picture, first of all, so we -- usually the -- the -- the way it\u2019s laid out is we deal with ideological issues, what the German aims were at the very top, what the specific conditions and administrative structures were in the particular region involved, and then getting down to the particular organization or organizations in chronological sequence as much as possible. And then going down as far as the documentation permits the expert to make a judgment. For instance, if the expert sees a month\u2019s worth of guard rotation assignments at a concentration camp, that expert can talk about those rotations, because he\u2019s seen enough evidence to convince him of how -- or -- or to define for him what the daily routine was like. If there\u2019s no evidence, he can speak about -- if there\u2019s no evidence -- well, let me -- let me retract that. If there\u2019s -- if we don\u2019t have the daily rotations, but only have evidence of the concentration camp within the system, then the expert, if he feels so comfortable in doing so, can talk about how -- what the normal routine was within the concentration camp system, and how in his expert opinion there\u2019s no reason to assume that for this particular concentration camp, it went any way differently. He cannot -- or I wouldn\u2019t, as an expert witness, try to get into the detail as to who was rotated where at what time, or even what the specific places of rotation were. That you\u2019d have to do on the basis of the evidence. You can\u2019t know that if you don\u2019t have the -- 1-1f -- 1f there\u2019s a gap in that documentation. And for instance, to give you an example, in the Schellong case, we didn\u2019t have that documentation for Dachau. We only knew that he was a security officer, and we knew that there were regular functions for security officers in concentration camps. And the expert testified as to that. We did have rotation rosters for the guards at Sachsenburg, where Schellong was at before he went to Dachau. And there the expert could talk very specifically that Conrad Schellong, on such and such a day, was outside the bunker. Or that he checked in on the bunker as security officer every three or four hours, whatever the -- the case might have been. For instance in the Hajda case, we could talk because we had, through a three tiered level of documentation, contemporaneous documentation of individuals who were in the Trawniki system, and who served at the Treblinka labor camp, individuals who after the war testified in western countries, where there was -- where you didn\u2019t have the baggage of what the Soviet system was like, that they had indeed been there, and done this, that and the other thing, and then of course, the Soviet protocols, in so far as the information contained therein was consistent with the original documentation, and the testimony in the western protocols. And through a s -- a combination of those three types of sources, we were able to identify where virtually every single individual who served at the Treblinka labor camp between March 1943, and its dissolution in July 1944, where they were. We were able even to determine what happened to the people who appeared on one roster and were no longer on the other roster. One was sent back because he was a chronic drunk, and we had documentation -- his own testimony in that case, that he became an alcoholic at Treblinka one. A post-war testimony in a German proceeding, a west German proceeding. In another case, an individual deserted, and we found the -- the German wanted list, indicating that this indi -- individual had deserted and was being sought at a time between the dates of the two rosters. And so the expert was able to speak in significant detail about who was at Treblinka one, when, and what they were doing there; and in a way that was very convincing to the judge."

There might be an unanticipated defense, an unanticipated piece of evidence, something that the -- that the defense would introduce at the last moment, whether it\u2019d been turned over in discovery or not.

Cause the -- the -- the nature of these cases, and the level at which the information was relevant -- most historians deal with the upper levels of an agency, and where we were dealing with people on the ground that are -- is generally not of much historical -- broader historical significance, given the complexity of the documentation, experts would forget this or that, or the other thing, and a follow-up question was often all one needed to trigger off what the expert already knew."

            "question": "Eyewitness, yeah.",
            "answer": "W-We use two types -- actually three types of eyewitnesses. There were two -- there was a traditional type of eyewitness, whether it was a survivor, or a fellow perpetrator who actually saw specific events at hand. We also used, a-a-and in this case survivor witnesses who may not have probably 1-1in many cases, most cases, didn\u2019t know the defendant, had no idea what the defendant did, but could talk in general about what his or her perception of what the guards were doing was, and also more important, what life was like. There\u2019s no one, no book, no perpetrator testimony, no historian can possibly get across with the same intensity as a survivor talking, what it felt like to the survivor. And it -- when the survivor talks, in that sense, if one ac-accepts the testimony as being no more than what it 1s, that survivor\u2019s memory, some of the inaccuracies that inevitably come up in human memory, even when they can\u2019t be reconciled with an explanation, still don\u2019t detract from the image of what life was like in a concentration camp, or in a line waiting to be shot at a pit. That this is something that -- this kind of testimony lends an immediacy that the dry documentation just can\u2019t give. But it also is less immu -- less vulnerable to attack than testimony, I saw him do it, because that raises all sorts of questions of how the witness knew who he was. And remember, he was most often wearing a uniform, and a cap, and looked pretty much like the next him and the next him after that. And how does this witness remember this particular person as opposed to anyone else? And in a trial with a dynamic where the defense attorney has the opportunity and must have the opportunity to question that witness\u2019s memory, to try to trip that witness, to try to ask questions, well isn\u2019t it possible that you could be mistaken? How do you really know that it was this person and not someone else? And in that ki - type of dynamic, that kind of testimony, unless there was some reason for the survivor witness to have known the man, the way you would -- the way you would judge the credibility of any eyewitness, in any criminal case, the eyewitnesses -- the survivor testimony was often much more effective to give a picture of the climate of persecution, to offer evidence as to the identity of the people who are being persecuted through their own persons. This was stuff that they knew. This was stuff that they would not be mistaken about and could not be mistaken about. Then we had a third type of witness, we had to develop how the process of certifying refugees, and how the refugees applied for visas, we had to establish that particular process. And we did that by locating individuals who had actually worked on those processes. In other words, displaced persons -- officials from the displaced persons commission. Officials from the counter- intelligence corps, state department visa officials. In -- in -- I -- I can\u2019t remember a single case frankly, where any one of these officials remembered the specific case that they were asked to testify. Well, after all, during the DP act there were 400,000 visas. That meant 400,000 investigations and 400,000 pre-application interviews. And no reasonable individual could be expected to remember one person as opposed to another, particularly if there wasn\u2019t a -- a specific hooker about that -- that case. But what we could ask them about was what was the regular procedure? Did you swear it was -- was -- was the applicant required to swear to the truth of what he was saying? What did the applicant need in order to become eligible to be a displaced person, to receive a visa? What were the exclusionary measures? How were they implemented? And in that way, the witness could take -- offer the judge testimony on how things actually worked. And we used those witnesses -- the OSI used those witnesses to introduce documentation regulations of the international refugee organization, regulations of the d -- Displaced Persons Commission. Visa regulations, advisory reports and what have you, that were relevant to the process of how a displaced person entered the United States and what information he was required to offer about his person in order to complete his application."

There was an argument about inclusion of the testimony and the judge agreed to include it, but then didn\u2019t use it very much in the final decision. And so, was it to give it a -- a taste of what this place was like, so that one could make a connection between what Hajda must have been doing, had he been there?",
            "answer": "I -- I -- I think the judge wanted to hear that. And -- a-and that certainly was the purpose of those witness -- they couldn\u2019t say anything about Hajda personally, neither of them, as I remember. They -- they -- even though it was a small camp, there were only roughly a hundred, 120 guards there at any one time. I-In that particular camp, the -- the commandant was a psychopath who often personally took pleasure in torturing individual prisoners, so he was a person who was fairly well known, even by name, to the prisoners of the camp. It was a small prison camp too, there were under a thousand people in the camp, under a thousand Jews. And there was one guard, a particularly cruel guard, who had the bad luck to have a patch over his eye. And so he was remembered, not necessarily by name, but they all remembered the one with the patch over his eye, and that\u2019s natural. And in fact, the one with the patch over his eye, bad as he was, often got blamed for virtually everything because a -- a -- a -- a survivor witness, in remembering bad things that happened also remembered the guy with the patch over his eye, and that the guy with the patch over his eye was a bad guy, and so the connection was made. And in many cases they were right, and in some cases they weren\u2019t right. But Hajda was just one guard among many and it -- in -- in that case it was very typical of the survivor\u2019s relationship to the normal -- normal in quotes -- prisoner guar -- the normal guard, that he was a person in a uniform, that unless there was some reason to know him on a daily basis, like a prisoner worked in a tailor shop and the guard commonly came to the tailor shop to get his boots fixed, there was some relationship that was ongoing. But just a guard on the perimeter was someone that the witness, after 40 years, couldn\u2019t be expected -- it wouldn\u2019t be fair to burden the witness with trying to remember that particular person. And so in this particular case it was made easy for us because the defendant stipulated to all of the horrors in the Treblinka one camp."

            "answer": "There was one case that I was on, the Bruno Blach case, where I was personally convinced that the survivor knew -- identified correctly, the individual as a guard. I was never quite certain that he correctly identified the individual as the person who committed a killing, which he did identify. But the reasons that his particular recognition of this person struck me as viable, and I saw him -- I saw him look at the photo spread, and in fact was -- when -- when the person was extradited to West Germany, the defendant was extradited to West Germany, I had to testify as a witness, an eyewitness to that identification process. There was no question that the face, the likeness of that picture registered with the -- with the witness in that case, in my mind. I was watching him when he looked at the photo spread, and I knew which photo was the defendant. And I was not asking the questions, an investigator was asking the questions, I was watching. And I saw him -- I -- I saw him when he hit that particular photo, flinch. And this was a very small camp, it was a sub-camp of Mauthausen, about 2000 prisoners, maybe a hundred guards and a small squad of guards with canines, about 15 of them. And this was one of the guys with a canine. He was a Sudaten German, and he also had a particularly handsome face. He was -- he was just striking looking. He was someone that one might remember in the context of a small group of people in a small camp, where the individual who was a Polish prisoner was -- was there for two years, both in -- both prisoner and guard were there for two years. The prisoners all worked in one factory, the guards all escorted them every day to that one factory. I don\u2019t know to this day whether the identification of this person as the killer in this case, was accurate. I don\u2019t know to this day. Under interrogation later in the West German proceeding against this individual, the evidence became so contradictory, even as to the identity of the victim of that shooting, that the defendant was ultimately acquitted in a criminal trial of the specific murder. But there\u2019s no question in my mind that that face was known to the witness.

Now, if the person lied and got in on the basis of concealing the information, the theory as I understand it, and it\u2019s probably best to ask the attorneys when you do interview them, the theory as I understand it 1s that because you lied, in theory if we prove that you lied, your status goes back to where you were before you obtained the visa, which is as an alien about which we can then determine whether you are eligible to enter the United States. Now, the burden of proof is on the government once you\u2019re here. In other words, the OSI always had the burden of proof in its cases against individuals who are here. But if you\u2019re an alien seeking entry into the United States, the burden of proof that you\u2019re eligible is upon the alien. So the alien must convince and demonstrate to the immigration official, and to the consular official, that he is a person, or she is a person eligible to enter the United States.

            "question": "Okay, let\u2019s go to Bartesch.",
            "answer": "Bartesch was unique for me in that it was the one case where there was credible evidence, perhaps not beyond a reasonable doubt evidence, but certainly clear and convincing evidence that he, Martin Bartesch shot someone on whom a name could be pinned. And it was also interesting in how that evidence came up, and how it was found. We had a series of concentration camp cases related to Mauthausen, and th -- and this is a -- a good example of how OSI operates. The Bruno Blach case, which I was assigned to, involved a sub-camp of Mauthausen, and that case was already under investigation as early as 1980. In investigating that case during the mid-80\u2019s when I investigated it, I went to the National Archives, to look through each of the U.S. military trials of Mauthausen personnel, that U.S. military personnel had conducted at the site of the Dachau concentration camp, in the records of the Judge Advocate General. Here -- at that time it was downtown here in -- well, no, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m sorry, at that time it was at Sootland, at the Sootland repository, now they\u2019re up in College Park, Maryland. And in the process of looking through all of that stuff, Bruno Blach was never at the main camp except for one day, he was transferred right away to a sub-camp called Wiener Neudorf. But in the process of identifying everyone whom I could, who went through the Mauthausen system, I gathered documentation from all of the Mauthausen and sub-camp trials so that I could put together an effective report eventually on how a person like Bruno Blach would come from Dachau, where he was before, via Mauthausen to Wiener Neudorf. Among the records that I found and didn\u2019t pay too much attention to at the time was a -- oh, it must have been about a hundred, 120 page document called an unnatural death book, unnatiirliches Todesfalle. U-Un -- c-cases of unnatural death. Which was a log kept by the authorities of the central camp of Mauthausen of all unnatural deaths that were unplanned unnatural. That didn\u2019t mean that they weren\u2019t planned, but 1t meant a -- a prisoner -- 1f some guards were having fun, and pushed a prisoner towards the wire, the guard shot, he was dead. That was recorded. I found it useful, has - has names of guards, I copied it, but filed it because there were -- I did actually do more than file it because there were a couple of cases of shootings in Wiener Neudorf. Not by Bruno Blach, but by others and that\u2019s evidence that if an expert witness wants to say prisoners were shot trying to escape at Wiener Neudorf, and the judge or the defense asks well, what do you base that on? What evidence? And then you have this log. Here so and so was shot on such and such a day, and by the way by this ga -- by this particular guard. Not Bruno Blach, but we have records of this. Now as it turned out, during that search I also found a Nuremberg document, 2176 PS, which was a collection of records that Mauthausen camp prisoners secured from destruction after the war, upon liberation, and turned over to the U.S. army investigator investigating crimes at Mauthausen from the day that the camp was liberated. He was a major named Eugene Cohen, who we actually found after the war and talked to after the war, although this case never went to trial, and so he -- therefore he was not a witness. But among these records were a series of rosters of Mauthausen guards, both at the main camp and at some of the sub-camps. And those rosters contained birthdates and ranks, and even last known addresses, what address that they had before they came to Mauthausen, before they entered German service. And so -- a-and again in -- in accordance with standard operating procedure at OSI we turned these over to the research and development department, and they ran them through the INS. And Martin Bartesch came up along with three others as a hit. And we then, in going back -- I had the Mauthausen cases originally, in the mid-80\u2019s. In going back through the documentation, I came back to this book of unnatural cases of death, and started reading each of the entries. And sure enough, Bartesch, Martin was assigned as a guard who shot a French Jewish teenager on such and such a date, I think it was October 1943. Bartesch himself was a teenager at that time. Bartesch was born, I believe in October 1926. I think 1t was October of \u201926, and so he was not quite 17, or just turned 17 when he shot a teenager, who I believe was 15 or 16 or 17, about the same age. And we also found another one of the cases, another one of the subjects who had come up on the roster was also on the list as having shot another French Jew at around the same time. And in that other case, which was the case of Stefan Riley, that individual actually confessed to having shot at a person whose name he didn\u2019t know, when confronted with that information. Both cases never went to trial because both individuals I believe -- Bartesch before -- Bartesch went without a lawyer, quickly. In fact, I think it was the same lawyer who later turned up in the Hajda case. Bartesch was also from Chicago, so the fact that this guy represented Bartesch, made him known to Hajda as well, later, I think. I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t know that for sure, but I do -- I do think Collins was also Bartesch\u2019s lawyer. Bartesch pled -- refused to talk to us, as was his right as a citizen. And was protected from doing so by his attorney, and fled to Austria before --"

            "answer": "The Hajda case was significant for me for two reasons. Three reasons, really. It was the first case that I as a historian with the attorney, the partner this time was someone I -- one of my very best and closest friends in the off -- in the OSI, Ned Stuttman. This was the first case that we had actually gone to trial with using primarily evidence that came as a result of the collapse of the Communist regimes in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. This case was built, not exclusively, but at least three-quarters -- 75 percent of the evidence was evidence that was taken from witnesses, or found in documentation that had been held behind the Iron Curtain since 1945. And it also represented our first, as an office, our first extensive use of post-war Soviet protocols, of witness interrogations, where we no longer had the witness alive to be cross- examined. And we used them very, very carefully in that we didn\u2019t accept them all at face value. We were up front about our doubts about the conditions under which this testimony was taken. We were also up front about the possibility that Soviet investigators at that time had specific information that was going into that protocol whether the witness said it or not. But we used them where the evidence contained in them was consistent with documentation, whether it was testimony given in the west, or captured German documentation, either captured by the western powers or by the Soviets, where the information was consistent, we could regard this evidence in the protocols as cooperative evidence. In other words, it didn\u2019t stand alone, but just because it was protocols taken, quite frankly, by Soviet intelligence agents, didn\u2019t mean necessarily that we as investigators could, a priori say this is all phony, this is all fake. We had to look at that evidence the way any historian -- and here in a sense the lawyers went the way of the historians, the way any historian looks at any evidence, with no a priori preconceptions, a priori suspicions but testing those elements of the testimony that made good historical sense, and being aware of those elements of the testimony which one should rightfully have doubts about. And I can give you an example. There were statements of former Treblinka guards, who identified Hajda, and there was a whole issue, as you probably saw, about the spelling of Hajda, because the Polish -- the s -- the -- the sound of Hajda, there\u2019s no H in Russian, and the interrogations were always in Russian. There\u2019s no H. The Russians replace H with the Cyrillic equivalent of the --"

            "question": "G.",
            "answer": "-- the English, or the Roman G, and so it was always Gajda, and there were any variation of Gajda, it could be G-a-1-d-a. It could be G-a-y-d-a, it could be G-a-y apostrophe d-a. And there was any number of variations of that. And then of course there were the obvio -- the -- the misspellings, and the mistranslations, and the -- the misspellings in the translation. But there were certain testimonies that identified Hajda as a Pole. Now the Russians -- the Soviets didn\u2019t have Hajda. Hajda was in the United States, they didn\u2019t have him. He was only of interest to them in that he was a name, another identification. There\u2019s no evidence that they even knew that he was in the United States, although the Soviets knew about many of the \u00e9migr\u00e9s who were in the United States. There was no interest because he was Polish, and because Poland was also a Communist country, that the Soviets were interested in extraditing him. But there were some witnesses who testified that Hajda was a Pole, even though most of the rest of the people -- a Pole was an anomaly among the Trawniki men. There were very small Polish recruiting drives, and there were only two of them who ever served at Treblinka one, two Poles. And not every witness said Hajda was a Pole. If every witness had said Hajda was a Pole, then one would have been suspicious. If every witness had gotten the first name right, one would be suspicious. But some of them got the first name, some didn\u2019t. Some got the wrong first name. Some didn\u2019t remember a first name at all, they just remembered a g -- a Hajda who was a Pole. And in a group of a hundred guards, that is more credible. On the other hand, you would get testimonies where the Soviet interrogator was clearly asking to identify what people were involved in the massacre of the surviving Jewish prisoners when the camp was evacuated in July 1944. And there you\u2019d have a list of 40 names. So and so -- I know so and so participated in the murder of 350 prisoners on the day that the camp was evacuated. The next guy would -- the s -- the exact same thing. The next guy would the exact same thing. And then you get Hajda\u2019s name, the exact same thing. As a historian, I tended to discount. Didn\u2019t mean that Hajda didn\u2019t participate, but I discounted that evidence as something that Soviet interrogators were interested in getting it because of the r -- the repeated question, it was just plugging a name into this statement, that they wanted. It was the oddities, the things that were different, that could be corroborated by other evidence, and Hajda\u2019s Polish origins were corroborated by personnel documents, and his place of birth. That could be used in these statements. We, in prosecuting the case, never charged that Hajda personally participated in the killings. We did charge that he was there at the time the killings happened, and we did describe, as you read, in -- in some detail, what the guards, the hundred of them, you know, there were a hundred, hundred and 10, were doing while these killings were taking place. So the judge had the data to make a judgment that well, we don\u2019t know what Hajda was doing, but we know he was participating in some way, because guards weren\u2019t sitting around. They were all doing one thing, either guarding the people who were guarding the perimeter of the camp while the people were being taken out to the woods in groups to be shot, guarding those who were left in the camp while the rest were being taken out to be shot, escorting groups to the camp, or actually shooting them. It was one of those things, all the guards were involved in that because that\u2019s what they were doing on that day. And that was based on the Soviet protocols, and the primary source documentation. And we were able to prove that Hajda was there because of a group of documents from the successor unit of the Trawniki training camp, the Battalion Streibel. There was a group of 20 men, all still working with the commandant of Treblinka one, who as well was evacuated. Every one of those 20 men were on rosters at Treblinka one. So it made no sense, it made no common sense, this was a common sense issue for Hajda not to have been there at the time of the killings, and still be on that post- evacuation roster with 20 other men who are all at the camp throughout, from 1943 through its evacuation in 1944."

            "answer": "No, there -- this was a -- a particular problem, it was -- it was an interesting case. It was -- was one of the reasons why we had to go into such detail concerning the personnel data of each of the people on the two Treblinka rosters, the one from March 22\" in which -- when Hajda was sent to Treblinka one, and the sort of inventory roster of 1944, approximately March 30\" -- 30\", 1944. Hajda\u2019s personnel file was missing. We didn\u2019t have his personnel file. When we finally -- when our investigator -- our historical investigators, those who could read Russian, finally got access to the records of the Trawniki trained guards in the federal security -- the archive of this Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation in the early 90\u2019s, they found the notes of the KGB investigator who saw that file, and the notes that he took were consistent with the type of information that was on other personnel files. So it was clear that there was a personnel file of Hajda. And later we were able to actually track where that file went. It went with a bunch of personnel files to Ukraine, which was part of the Soviet Union in 1949. And tragically, tragically, this was very frustrating. It was, a-according to the Ukrainian authorities, 1t was destroyed in the spring of 1992. The case was filed in the summer of 1992. So before we made a request of the Ukrainians, 1t was destroyed, as the Ukrainian says, part of a normal documents destruction process."

The father used language that -- well, I don\u2019t remember exactly what the father said, but the father\u2019s knowledge was a little less direct. He only said that his son was in service with the Germans, or it was some- something vague like that, I can\u2019t remember exactly what it was. The sister, if I remember correctly, used a ter -- the German term Wachmannschaft, which happened to be the term describing -- Wachmannschaft was something -- it was the term that described a part of the Battalion Streibel. And she used the term Wachmannschaften in Jedrzejow. And Jedrzejow is city in central -- south central Poland, along the vistu -- Vistula River, where the Trawniki men were evacuated in July 1944, in order to press gang forced Polish laborers into building fortifications along the vis -- Vistula. You -- you\u2019ll remember from your history that the Red Army was stopped on the Vistula in front of Warsaw, and all up and down the Vistula, the offense ran out of steam, and the next offensive didn\u2019t come until January 1945. So these Trawniki men had, between July 1944, late July 1944, and the middle of January 1945, they were on the Vistula River, supervising local forced labor, digging fortifications on the west side of the Vistula. She knew either -- and I can\u2019t remember now, either she visited him or she got a letter from him that he was in the Wachmannschaften in Jedrzeyow. Now there was nothing that was particularly horrible about -- yeah, bad things happened there, but it wasn\u2019t like Treblinka. It wasn\u2019t like Belzec, it wasn\u2019t like Trawniki. It was a later time that seemed to be no conceivable reason for Polish investigators in 1945 -- remember, this was January \u201945, this was before the Soviet offensive that liberated Jedrzejow. This family is in -- near Zakopane, on the other side of the Vistula, they\u2019re being interrogated, and here she is saying that he is in the Wachmannschaften in Jedrzejow. Now he was in a company, but the headquarters of the Streibel battalion was in fact at that time in Jedrzejow. And that was convincing to me as a historian, to the attorneys as prosecutors and ultimately to the expert and to the judge, that in fact, Bronislaw Hajda was in the Streibel battalion, and gave a tremendous amount of authenticity to our use of all of those rosters, because the Streibel bat -- if the Streibel battalion rosters, which contained similar information to the Treblinka rosters, were valid -- and -- an-and not -- not only in the sense of authenticity, but in terms of the accuracy of the information, the accuracy of the personnel data, and the accuracy of where these place -- where these units were stationed, that gave greater credibility, because of the names on the Streibel battalion rosters, to the names on the Treblinka rosters. And it gave an e -- extra added push of credibility to the paper. And that\u2019s how paper and witness testimony can corroborate one another, whereas a reasonable person might have questions about either one, but the exact fit, that just wouldn\u2019t happen if you were forging."

To give you an example of that, it\u2019s common knowledge -- and I put that in quotations, that the Nazis like to give their auxiliaries alcohol 0 before sending them out on a mission. Everybody says that, and in fact, witnesses talk about auxiliaries being drunk while they were shooting. But, in all the hundreds of statements of Trawniki men that I read, and in all the documents of Trawniki -- relating to Trawniki trained guards, there\u2019s nothing about issuing of alcohol rations prior to an operation. And in fact, when you think of it, it makes no sense. You don\u2019t give men whom you\u2019re going to put rifles in their hands, and whom you may not entirely trust, alcohol to drink, for fear of nothing else that they\u2019 II shoot each other, or they\u2019! shoot you instead of the people they\u2019re supposed to shoot. But why were -- why did witne -- were witnesses wrong when they saw some of them drunk? No, not in the cases of the Trawniki men, because of during the shooting and during deportations, the Trawniki were constantly extorting on their own whatever valuables, whether it be cash or booze that the victims had. Sometimes it was cash and they turned it into booze, so that some of the auxiliaries did have booze, and did partake of booze prior to a operation, and that\u2019s -- so what the witnesses saw, what the survivors saw, what they perceived to have seen was not entirely inaccurate. But the assumption that was drawn, that everybody just kind of believed, was inaccurate."

Becoming interested in areas such as the auxiliary police, and Poland, and the Trawniki trained guards that might not have come across my radar screen as serious interests had I not been at OSI. The a-ability to put these pieces together in -- in original formulations. Subjects that nobody had written about because there was no public evidence available for people to construct a thesis on. This was all professionally very satisfying as a historian, I think prepared me in many ways, broadened me in many, many ways, that made me perhaps better pra -- prepared to take over the position of the senior historian at the Holocaust Memorial Museum. Personally, I find it very satisfying because as a federal civil servant I felt that I was doing a service to the American people in the sense that, having grown up in the Vietnam generation, I was contributing to a process where individuals who committed crimes during wartime, with all the excuses that one has to commit acts of atrocity during wartime, were being called to account, despite the fact that they were small fry. Despite the fact that in some cases they were compelled to be in the positions where they eventually committed their crimes. Despite the fact that decades and decades had passed, and that there was some reason for them to feel that this would never come back to haunt them. That this was a process, a judicial process, a fair process by which people who had committed crimes could be called to account. And if there is a potential for that in the future, conceivably the perpetrators of the future might stop to think twice before perpetrating crimes along the lines of these crimes that 2 were perpetrated during the second World War. And if that potential of legal consequence even works to prevent one killing, I feel that it would be worth that effort, both for the future in terms of prevention, and in terms of bringing closure to the past."

I certainly came to OSI, or the SLU at that time with the excitement of being able to write history and convey history to a broader public, to historians, but also to a broader public through the legal process, and I\u2019ve come to realize that a legal proceeding is just that, it has a specific purpose, and that is to ascertain a violation or a crime, a civil case violation and criminal case a crime, to ascertain a defendant, to assign or determine what the responsibility of the defendant is, and to determine an appropriate punishment for the crime. I think as a result of that, or at least as a result of an investigation, a part of the historical record, whether it\u2019s through witness testimony, perpetrator or survivor, or through documentation that otherwise would not have been uncovered, or would not have been uncovered as quickly, can push forward a broader but different process of trying to understand and analyze what happened. I think a trial deals with an individual, or in rare cases a small group of individuals, to determine their responsibility for very specific events, and to understand a broader historical process requires a different process. And to expect the justice system to fulfill that latter purpose, to understand why things happened on a deeper level, those who expect that are going to be disappointed by the judicial process because they\u2019re putting too much on it, that this is a subject of a broader and more intensive inquiry."

After World War II, with -- with all its ineffectiveness, we do now have a United Nations which is going to respond when one country attacks another. Now, the next step is what do when a country disintegrates, or when one minority in a country starts butchering another minority in a country. That\u2019s something that perhaps the development of an international court, and the devel -- certainly the development of more cohesive international reaction. Certainly the development of a quicker response in terms of providing shelter for refugees, which is something we ought to have learned from the last 3 world war. That all of these initiatives are going to have to come into play in the future. Whether we'll be able to prevent all killings, we as human beings, I\u2019m not talking about we as the United States, but we as citizens of the world, will be able to prevent killings is something no one\u2019s going to be able to guarantee. But to work towards mitigating killings, to work towards providing sanctuary -- speedy sanctuary for people who might be the victims of killings, and that- that is something that we certainly could have done more quickly in Rwanda at least, and quite probably in Yugoslavia as well. But there -- each situation is different, and we, as citizens of the world again, not just we the United States, or we the west, we as citizens of the world are going to have to work towards strategies for dealing with internal disturbances, internal civil wars, internal persecution, in a way that is effective."
