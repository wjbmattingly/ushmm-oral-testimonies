            "question": "Okay, Sonia, the first thing I want you to do is tell me your full name, and when and where you were born. And then just tell me a little bit about your growing-up years, your community.",
            "answer": "I was born in a small town there in Poland, this was a big town, Novogrudok. They had 10 or 15,000 people there. I was born in April 15, 1922, to a very rich father and mother. I had four brothers, two older and two younger than me. And I had my education there. I was studying in a liceum, with languages. I finished gimnazjum, and then I went for two years in liceum where I studied Latin, French, Polish, and History. When -- before the war broke out, I was two, three months before finishing my studies. I was dreaming to go to Paris, because we had a family there, to study dentistry in Sorbonne with the whole family. My mother\u2019s was there. But the war came in, and my dreams finished. The German came to the city in December 1941. We didn't know nothing about the war. You know, it was small town. We know only that very bad will be for the Jewish people. But we couldn't imagine it should be so, so bad, because when the first German came, they were dancing with us. And one -- I was a pretty girl, and one told my parents, \u201cMake her papers that she is Polish and let her go from the city, because it will be very bad.\u201d And that's what -- when they went, they came, the S.D. and the S.S., and the war began. In the beginning it was not so bad, because they begin -- After two months, they began to organize the ghetto. So all the people went out from the houses, and they put us on -- ina small -- in a couple of houses. Pereseka. They're called, Pereseka. This was like Brooklyn, New York, and Queens, like one of the city. And we were staying there till they said we have to go out in the streets, and this began the Aktion. When the Aktion began, my father saw that is very bad, so he took me, and -- I had a brother -- Jay, and he said, \u201cCome on. I will show you something.\u201d And he ran away. He knew the policeman, the Polish, and they let us go. So I ran away to a village where my mother was born. And we stayed in a church because my father know there the people. We stayed there about seven days under the church. They had a place in Poland where the potato -- they were holding the potatoes should not freeze. And we staying there for a whole week. He let us stay. It was very nice. And after a week, he said, \u201cThe action is gone and you can go to the ghetto.\u201d We didn't know where my mother was. But my mother was a very intelligent girl. She was a rabbi's daughter. And she saw from far that my father went away with me, with my brother. She understood that he will take care, too, on us. So she took care on herself. She run to the village where she was born, this was Barabevit. And there friends of hers, what she was studying with them in school, he keep her for 10 -- or two weeks."

            "answer": "The friends? Not Jewish, no. The people -- they were very good people, too, not Jewish. Not every Jew is good, too. There is certain people what are better than Jew. They were keeping us, and if they would find them, he would be killed together with his whole family. But he was keeping us. After two weeks, when I was already with my father and brother in the ghetto, he came in and he said, \u201cYou know what, I would like to know if Mr. Boldo 1s alive.\u201d He didn't say that he has my mother. So they said \u201cyes.\u201d They let him in. And he said, \u201cYou know, I have your wife.\u201d This was a shock for us because we were sure that she is not alive. And after a couple of days, she came and she was with us in the ghetto."

And you know this small houses, so he keeps us in the house for two hours or three hours till they took away everybody for killing. And we went out. The policemen saw him, but he didn't hold us. They let him go because he knew him from before. He was a Polish policeman. And that's how we survive for the couple of months. After the action, we came back to the ghetto. We didn\u2019t -- we were not hungry because the villages, the people, knew that we are there. They were bringing us food, bread, meat, everything. They were beautiful, wonderful people. And till today, we are sending them packages. They are not alive, but we send them packages to give to the kids."

They took away the head of the city. And then in the month -- in December, this was a regular action for whoever was in the street they took. This is the -- first of all, they took the men. They said that they are going to work on a -- work in a camp, a working camp. But they never came back. Nobody knew about it. But the paysans, that means people from the villages, they knew because they saw it. And they were coming to the ghetto and they were saying, \u201cThere is no camp. They are all killed.\u201d This was the first action."

            "question": "Okay. So you came back to the ghetto. And then tell me a little bit about living in the ghetto, and how long you were there, what it was like.",
            "answer": "We stayed in the ghetto, I think, a couple of months they came to the ghetto -- after the couple of months, this was a regular living. You were working. I was working in the hospital, and the others was working in the street because the street were bombardment, bombard. Everything was broken, so they were cleaning up. And this was not so bad. Nobody \u2014 they were thinking, you know -- people were thinking what\u2019s good is for me. They were thinking, \u201cI will survive. They are not touching us no more.\u201d And they were sitting. Then one day, a son of friends of ours came in. And said, \u201cYou know what? I saw 11 people from the ghetto that went out at night and I know where they went. They went to the forest, but nobody survived. Because they told them where to go, and the Germans were staying there already and waiting for them.\u201d And this was the first group for the trying to went out, and they were killed. So, you know, that\u2019s very difficult to go out. We can go out, but we will not be alive. So this was first time. This was -- I think this was already after the winter. The winter was very bad. In Poland, the winter is terrible. So this was probably in March or April another group went out, and we never heard about this. The German came and the they were gave -- they went to segregate the young and the healthy, and they took them to the court there. In Novogrudok, there was a court. And there in the court they were working, and the rest stayed in the ghetto on the Pereseka. There were the kids, the older, and the sick. They didn't kill all of them right away, but after a couple of months, yes. They begin to talking about in the court that something 1s wrong. They\u2019re preparing something, the Germans. Nobody knew what and where. My parents stayed in there, in the ghetto, in Pereseka. And my father said, \u201cI don't want her to be there,\u201d to my mother. So they paid. We had money. We had gold. We had many things. And they paid to a Polish man what he was bringing the bread to the ghetto, to the court. So he paid him. And he bring in -- one night, he bring the bread to the court, and he put me in the basket from the bread. And he brought me to my parents. I was there not a long time, because my parents began to receive letters from the partisan, from my husband, from Alex. And he wrote him -- he didn't know me, I didn't know him. There is a big difference between from the village. He was from a village, very small, Stankiewicze. There were five houses. One of the house, one Jewish family, the Bielskis. And they had, I think, about 10 brothers and two sisters. And his sister was married to uncle of mine, but I never knew him, too. It was great uncle, whatever. And she said -- she was too, in the forest. And she said to him, \u201cYou know what, I saw by the Boldos\u2019 a beautiful girl, and I would like you to send somebody after her.\u2019 And he was a very good- he had two -- he had a wife and a three-month-old child. But he didn\u2019t go -- after she gave birth to the child, she didn't want to go to the forest. So this day when he send after her was the liquidation of this house, and she got killed with the child. So he was by himself. And he wrote a letter to my parents that he will guarantee my safety. But I didn't want to go. I was afraid for the tree. I was afraid for the forest. I was afraid for everything because I never were there. But when my parents saw what is here, they said, \u201cListen, I want you to go. I would like you -- better to die there than I would see you dead here.\u201d And he send a couple of men with rifles. And at night, my father paid again to the police, Polish. And I went out with the friend of mine, Leah, to the forest. I came there -- we went out there about 12 o'clock, we came there about four o'clock, to the forest where we saw already about 18 people with rifles. I was afraid of them, too. I was not used to that, but I got used to that. And then I met my husband. So it was very nice in the morning, about 6 o'clock in the morning, my friends Chaya\u2019 that was already the girlfriends from mine other brother-in-law, Asael\u2019. She said, \u201cYou know, I have a commander and I am with him and I am very happy.\u201d I said to her \u2014 I was looking on her -- and I said, \u201cCan you tell me maybe there's another commander?\u201d She said, \u201cYes. One is Alex, his brother, the younger.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cWho is he? Where is he?\u201d She said, \"Don't worry. About seven o'clock you will see him.\" And really about seven o'clock I saw a man with rifles, all over. I saw a man, a giant. He was six-two, and a young handsome -- I had afraid of him, too. But life is life. After -- He was very good to me from the beginning. He was very good to me. And he said to me, \"You know, you came here. I would like you to stay with me.\" I said, \"You know what, I will stay with you, but I want you to take out my parents.\" And I made with him like, \u201cYou know, you have to take them out, then I will stay with you.\u201d And it took him all about seven or six days and my parents came. After my parents came, after a day, the whole ghetto went in flames. But I came to the forest end of August. August 15 was the second Aktion. And my brother died there, got killed. He didn't get killed in the action, but he saw that they were taking away my mother. My father was staying with me. So he went to work. My mother, so he wanted to take care on her. So he took her out from the lines, dead, to the lines of living. You understand what I am talking? And the German -- the people were counted. And he knew that somebody is missing, but he couldn't give out my mother. So they took him in on the truck, but he was killed when he was running from the truck."

I know about him, because if somebody came from the ghetto -- people were coming from the ghettos -- they didn't know where to go. So the first house was Kozlowksi's house. So he was keeping them. And he said, \"Don't worry, somebody will come and they will take you to the forest.\" They were beautiful people. You don't have to forget this. You cannot say that everybody was bad."

That was the four brothers -- the three brothers and they had their brother, Aaron, 13 years old. And they have a sister, what she was married to Chaya's brother. So that was the Bielskis and the Dzienciolskis. This was the whole thing. But later came another seven men and they made 70 people, 70 or 80 people, when I came in. This was the beginning of the partisans because people were -- went away from the forest -- went away from the ghettos. They didn't have a place there. And they -- the doors from the Bielskis brother were open for everybody, for old, children, sick people. And they had always food. They didn't * Konstanty Kozlowski have steaks, but they have bread and water. They were very good. They were no different, but later, then many people came in. So there were men that said, \u201cListen, why do I have to go and grab food and risk my life? My wife is not here, my children are not here. Why should I risk the life for them?\u2019 But the Bielskis brother said, \u201cEverybody who is coming has to have a place here. And eerybody will have a piece of bread.\u201d They will not have maybe something else, but bread they will give everybody. This was one kitchen, one big kitchen and they were cooking potatoes with a piece of bread. And this was the food. Later, when the people came in more and more, they went out and knew that the Germans were 1n this village. And the German came into the village and knew they will collect bread and butter and milk and meat, whatever. So we were putting ambushes -- ambush is that the right word?"

            "answer": "The villages told us everything. Not us, to the Bielskis brother. They were afraid of them, terrible. One cannot fight, but if you three brothers, six-two with rifles and you knew you cannot live, you knew that he will touch something, whatever, you will not do the nght thing, they will be killed. So they did everything. They were telling us that in a couple of days they have to pay to the German so much and so much. Not in money, but in food. So the Bielskis knew that the food is coming. The villages are giving them. We need it, too, the food. So that's what we took away. That was the harvest. That's what you mean, right? And we took away and we told to the villages, remember one thing, you giving them because you don\u2019t want, because Germans, too, they were killing them. They were killing them. They put everything on a fire and they went away. So you have to give them, half them and half to us. And that's what they did. They were not always friendly, because you see, there were Aktions. The Bielskis were fighters. Not everybody, but they had a group of fighters. They had, the beginning, they had about 50 fighters. Later, the number went up and up and up. And they were not only fighting with the Polish police, they were fighting between the partisans, too. They were Polish -- not Polish, but German partisan \u2014 German -- Russian partisans. They were against us, too. First of all, because we were Jews. Second, because we knew better the neighborhood and we knew the people. So this was a plus, a big plus for us. And they were saying that we are taking away all of the food. Remember 1,000 people in the beginning. You have to feed them. And they were not sitting all of them in one place. We had afraid for that. So in groups, this was about 20 people in groups, they were sitting in the summertime up. In the wintertime, we had under the -- underground they were sitting. And when you are in the snow, every little thing you can see. So we were very careful, but you know you cannot take away from the villages. They knew very good. The Bielskis knew the place, but they knew, too. So we have to be in peace with them. You cannot take away everything. You have to leave them, too, for the family, something. But we managed. We managed. In the wintertime, I never were in the forest. I was always -- it's called a hutor. This mean a farm from one house or two houses. So I went with my husband and another 15 people. They were riders. And went there, sleep over about four or three hours and we went back to the forest. But they were very good to us. I cannot say it. Nobody would survive if not the people from the villages. They had afraid, but they give us whatever we needed. Later, already in -- this was in \u201843. In \u201844, we got already the rifles and everything from Moscow. They were sending us by planes. And they were bigger commanders than the Bielskis. They were commanders what they put on the front from the Russians, from Moscow. And they were good. They said to us like that. We were complaining always. You know, they have took a group of ours, 14 people. They took away their rifles, took away their food, and let them go without shoes even. They said, \u201cRemember Mr. Bielski -- brother Bielski, remember one thing, this 1s life. You have to fight for them -- for that.\u201d Not once my husband -- My husband was always between the German and the Polish army. The Polish, they were working together with the German, the Kozaks. He was always on the horses. He was giving everything to the all partisan and from the Naliboki puszcza. You know what is a puszcza, puszcza is the biggest forest, you cannot live there. This is only for the animals. This is not far from Novogrudok. This was between Novogrudok and Minsk. But we were there in the beginning. And they couldn't find us because you have to go by foot or by horses. They were afraid. They cannot go with the tanks there. They were surrounding us and we heard them talking and shooting. And we were sitting on mud without food for 10, for 12 days, till my husband -- I am telling you everything in one story -- till my husband said, \u201cThey cannot take no more hunger.\u201d This was the only brother he said, \u201cI cannot -- I have to go fight myself.\u201d So he took 150 people -- not 150, 90 people, and I was, too, in the group by my husband, and he opened the forest. We come in after the German who saw the fire still burning. They were warming the food, but nobody touch it. When we went out to open the forest, after a day, another 100 people went out and another hundred people because the Germans left us alone and we went away from there. And then we went to get organized again. This was the life. We were fighting them not in the open. You cannot fight a German soldier in the open. We were surrounding them. We know where they are and we were fighting them and took off everything from them. And that\u2019s what this was life of the partisan. Not only us, there were the Russian partisan. The same thing, they were fighting, not in the open field, because in the open field you got killed from them. They had better everything."

But when I didn't see him, I was afraid of everything. I had a gun for myself, for my protection. He gave it to me. Nothing else. This 1s it. I had a very good life in the forest. He gave to me everything. I never cooked. I never did nothing. I was the commander's wife. You met my sister-in-law, Lilly. There were three brothers. The oldest was Tuvia. You know, in a small villages in small cities, the older brother is the head of the family. And when they got together, they put him, Asael, his older brother, and Zusia\u2019, they made him a hero. They made him the head of the partisan. He was a very nice man. They, all of them, they were very nice."

            "answer": "Never. Never. Nobody knew the forest. They were born there. They were born in a small village, and they knew the forest and they knew the people. They knew everything. How could I survive, or somebody else? All 1,200 people, nobody would survive. Because there were people from other city, too, not only from Novogrudok, from Lida, from Baranovichi, from Vilna -- the people never were in the forest. You know, Jewish people, they are not going to the forest. They are in the city. Only they survived because of the Bielskis brothers. I cannot say because of Tuvia, because of Asael, because of Zusia. No, the three of them, they were one. Because nobody did something where the other one didn't want it. All of them, they work together. Whatever they had between them, nobody knew, but they were together. And that is what we survived."

            "answer": "Their instinct, instinct. You know, when you are born in a village, yes, you think that is the whole world. That is the whole world for them, for the people. They knew that if they would go to the ghetto they will get killed because once Tuvia got to the city to take something and they took him. The German took him, hit him so, so much. And he -- I don't know how he survived. At night we were sitting, and he said, \"What I am sitting? What am I waiting for?\" And he ran away to the forest. The first in the forest was my husband and his brother, Asael. How come the first? My husband, when the German came, he was in the Russian army. They took him. You know, the Russian, when they came in \u201839, they were taking the young > Aleksander Bielski people to the army for work, whatever. So he was in the army. But he saw on the road going home, he said that was terrible. Whoever came and they were asking him, \u201cAre you a Jew, or you are Polish?\u201d whatever, they got killed. So he said \u201cno.\u201d He was speaking very nicely Russian and speaks beautiful Polish. And He doesn't look like a Jew, he looks like a Russian. So he said that he will not get in the Russian -- in the German and that's what he did. He came home at night. He was in Bialystok in the army there. He came at night. He was swollen in the legs and everything. So his mother said to him, \u201cStay for a couple of days home.\u201d He said, \"No, Mother. I am not staying. I will stay in the forest near the house.\u201d And that's what happened, because in this time when she said to him, \u201cstay in the house,\u201d and they came in the morning and took away his mother and his father and two brothers. And they never see the light of the day. And they were sitting not far away. And by now the girlfriends \u2014 he had a girlfriends, a Polish, and she made a place for him in the house. So the first to went to the forest was my husband and his brother, Asael. When they were already in forest, then came Tuvia. This was \u2014 didn\u2019t take a long time, probably about a week or two. So and they had a sister in another village, Tajba. She was married to the Dzienciolski. When they heard about the German, the whole Dzienciolski family ran away and they left her with a small baby in the house, the sister, Tajba. So my husband went and he took her out with the baby to the forest. She had the baby of nine months. She is still alive today. And they went in the morning to the people -- they didn't have children. And they said, \u201cListen, at night\u201d -- This was wintertime already \u2014 \u201cat night I will bring my sister's daughter, Lola.\u00b0 Please take care. If you will not take care and something happen to her, you will not be alive.\u201d And that's what happened. He put -- my husband, he put the baby onto the door. It was winter. And they were watching and they didn't hear nothing. They were sure that the baby is already in the house. They forgot about it. So the baby was already frozen when they took her into the house. And they took care on her. And they said, \u201cGod sent us a baby daughter.\u201d And they took care till after she was three years. They didn't want to give her back after the war. No. But you know they took away and they appreciate very much, too. The daughter 1s alive. She is now 50 something. And last year, she was there and she saw not the family -- the family's dead already -- but the children of the family. And this is -- she is alive today. That's it."

But we didn't have too many things that they said to us that\u2019s true and was not true. Maybe a couple of times, but not too many. They had afraid of them. They had one partisan Victor Panchenko. He was a Russian commander. He began the partisan when the Russian people -- the soldier run away from the German, so he had the couple, and he began to be bigger and bigger and bigger. He was fighting us, too, in the beginning. Because he said, \u201c\u201cYou taking away everything; there is nothing for me.\u201d But they made it okay.

What are you doing? What for you need these people, they can't bring nothing.\u201d\u2019 But we did \u2014 the Bielskis didn't listen to them. They took in everybody. This was like the angels. Where would I go, and hundreds of me? I didn't know where to go. I didn't know the forest. I even didn't know how to take care of nothing. I was sitting maybe -- there were people were sitting under the tree and waiting somebody should come to take them. Didn't know where to go. I have a partisan of ours, he is in London -- Cohen.\u201d He was with frozen legs. This was wintertime. And he was sitting three days with frozen legs under the tree till he saw from far away horses. So he covered himself with the snow. He had afraid. He heard somebody talking something Commander Bielski. So he went out. My husband took him on his horse, and took him to the place where he was in the hospital. And he is today without the fingers, but he 1s alive. And he's in London. There another thing, we went to Israel a couple years ago, a couple -- about 10, 15 years ago, and when we came, we have there two people what they were in the partisans, and they said to us like that, \"You know what, one child wants to see you.\" So my husband said, \"How old is the child?\" \"The child is about 35 years old.\" He said, \"Who is she?\" \"You maybe don't know, but you met her under the tree with her mother. She was a baby, small baby. And she was sitting and crying. She didn't know what to do.\" My husband said, \"Don't cry. You will be all right.\u201d And he went and put her under the horse, the mother and child and they still -- they are alive today with families. So you cannot * Jack (Idel) Kagan remember everything what you did, but you did one thing, you gave them survivals. You gave them life. Then people were not so happy, too, in the partisan, because maybe somebody when he went to take the food, he had more food than somebody sitting the forest. So -- but he had a piece of bread and the potato. The other one, maybe put a piece of butter or something else in pocket. He bring to his girlfriends, so maybe the other one was not happy. There were command, she -- partisans, but they were the head of 10 or 20 people. So they had better than somebody else, but that's life. That's life. There were many complaints, but this was nothing. Because the life for them, they were alive. They went to sleep, and didn't have afraid of the German for a long time. And this is what they did, the Bielskis. They will go into history like not many people, because Jewish partisan, Jewish were very little. There were Jews in other Russian partisan, but not like the Bielskis brother. They took anybody had the place, anybody had the place. And that's what they did. The name -- I know my son. I have three sons. They are all born in Israel were. One is already a doctor, 45. I have another son, he 1s 40. And my baby -- no, the other one is 42. This one is 41. And this one, wherever he hears something, he is staying tall. He is six-two, too. \u201cThat is my father.\u201d And the fighters, the same thing, like the father. My son the doctor, in \u201856 -- no, \u201873, he went to Israel. He left his studies and he were fighting there on the Jordanian border. My middle one is not so, but the baby, he finish college, and he went and he was a parachute. You know what is parachute? And he finished the parachute, they ask him to stay in the army. He say, \u201cNo, I have to go home, because I didn't say goodbye to my parents.\u201d"

So everybody, you know, you have a family, and you are expecting if you know somebody, he should take care on yourself. But he couldn't. He even couldn't take care of his mother and two sisters. He lost them, too. After the liquidation of the ghetto, he came to the forest. I, with my husband, went to sleep, to a village. And in the morning about seven o'clock, we came with the horses. My husband, he didn't go by himself, always with 10 people, riders.

You don't mind? Okay. One was Pesach Friedberg. One was Boris Rubin. One was the \u201cAloshki,\u201d they called him. They were from the -- our city. They were not so -- you never knew them, but they were very good boys. They went and collect the food and they give the food to the place where everybody has to give. Janek Rudniski. Olek Peck. Alexander Peck. They were the best guys. The best. They didn't have afraid for nothing. They knew that they have to go collect the food, because if not -- 1f they will not collect, they will die from hunger. That's not when you live in a small village and you are not far, 500 mi-- 500 feet, and you can go in and ask for a piece of bread. This was far away from the villages. This was in a puszcza, Puszcza Naliboki. If you will go out yourself, the animals will kill you. So they knew what they were doing, and they did a marvelous job. They were fighting and they were taking the food and they were bringing the food. And nobody should forget the Bielskis brother -- without the people, they will not be Bielskis partisan. They were the heads, but they have to work with something. And the young people made the partisans. That is what you have to give credit. There is no commander without the army. And not everybody likes to mention this, but I have to mention. Eisenhower would never win the war without the young people from the United States, without the fighters. They made him whatever he was. The same thing with the Bielskis. The people that were surrounding them, the young boys, they were not afraid of nothing. The commander sent them and they went.

Because once you take away and the other one, they will send the German on you. So you had to be afraid, too. You have to let them survive, too, the war. The war was a very bad war. And that is what the Bielskis did. You cannot take away the pillow, the last one from them. They were people, young, they didn't know. They took the pillow, they took the cover. What for? But they took. They were complaining to the Russian partisans that, \u201cThey took away my pillow. They took away my last piece of meat.\u201d So the Bielskis took care on that. You couldn't take away everything. You take only that\u2019s what you have to. Bread we needed, that's what you have to take, nothing else. You have to be very careful.

You were always watching yourself every step, because you didn't know from where is it coming. You had to go for water and you have to wash yourself. Because all over the water was divided between the villages. And there were washing the things there and drinking the water and bathing themselves. So all over there were people and ice. And we have to watch ourselves. The worst thing was in the winter. The worst thing, because it was cold. And the snow will tell you where the people are. And to take the food was very bad, because you couldn't go off it -- you have to take the food on a wagon or something. So you left always -- you saw every step, you were watching. I was very lucky.

You get.\" So they went to the village and said, \"Listen, how many you have?\" He said, \"I have only one.\" He said, \"Give me the one.\" When he went for the one, they find more than one. So they got the rifles from the villages. Later, they made -- 10 or five German, they went for the food. German were always looking for food, for eggs, for chickens, whatever. So they made an ambush on them. They saw them going and coming back. They made an ambush of them. They kill them. They took the boots. They took the foods and the rifles. And this was the beginning.

And they have enough rifles. And you had people what came from the ghetto, they knew how to clean them, how to take care of them. So the rifles was very good. This 1s the beginning. Later, the Russian in \u201843, the beginning, they were sending them us by plane. But we were paying them. Nobody knew about it, but I knew. I knew it. They preparing -- they took from everybody whatever they have, a ring, or a watch, whatever they had. They giving away and they give to the Russian commander, to Platon, or whatever.

And over staying in Chrapiniewo -- this was a village before Iwje. It was two houses. One house I was staying with Chaya, and the other house was Grisha'' and the Ticktins.

They knew that we are in the two houses, so they surround us, too. I was in the first house near the forest, and Regina with Sonia, Tuvia's girlfriends, were in the other house. When they surround us from in the back, we heard already they came in white. You know, was winter. The snow with the white things, you couldn't know that somebody is moving. But a commander in Russia, a Russian commander, a Russian partisan, he knew that we are staying there. And he came and said, \"Go out right away from the house, because you will get killed. The German are around.\" I was out without boots, without a coat, without nothing. And I said to Chaya -- Chaya was the wife of Asael -- I said, \"Go. You will tell how I died.\" She said, \"I am not going with you -- without you.\" And she took me for the hand. I fall in snow. The snow was so deep. Fall in snow \u2018til end.

When we were sitting at night and they were singing -- far in the puszcza, nobody was there, only us -- so we were singing and -- you know -- and talking, so they said, \u201cYou know what?\u201d this is already a couple of years like that \u2014 \u201cI am sure that this will be a break. Roosevelt will send somebody here and we will survive.\u201d Only hope. Nobody was thinking that, \u201cI will die.\u201d When I was asking my husband some place, \"Tell me, will we survive?\" He said to me like that, \"I don't know about me, but you will survive.\" And I was quiet then. I was so sure that whatever he said to me this will be. This is the hope. He gave it to me, the hope."

If you had a couple of people, so they were not with the groups, they were lonely. And if you were good with all of them, you work together, you were not so lonely. You spoke about your families. You spoke about your future, what it will be. You were singing. They were dancing. They were waiting for a plane from Moscow, like -- I don't know -- like angels were coming. And they knew everything. I know when my parents were alive with me in the partisan, came a plane. And I had a cousin, a doctor in Moscow, my mother's cousin. So my mother wrote a letter. She knew the family. She knew that they were doctors. And she sent a letter to them and, \u201cPlease, if you're alive, I have two sons in Israel. Tell them that we are alive, and I hope to be alive still.\u201d And you know what, when we came to Israel - we were the first in \u201c45, in October \u201945, we were already in Israel because Sharett -- this was a minister, an Israeli -- Israeli was not then in existence. It was Palestine. Israel came alive in \u201848. So he heard about the Bielskis when he was sitting in Israel. You know, people from Europe, they were talking about the Bielskis. And he said when we came he send us the first papers to Romania, with legal right to go by plane -- by boat to Israel. When we came into Israel in \u201945, my brother said, \"I knew about you. I got a letter from Moscow. And I knew that you are alive, that my brother, J ay,\u201d is not alive. But I knew about you and the parents.\" So you see, everything you cannot -- everything you knew about. Everything. You knew in Israel about the fighters. You knew about the Jewish partisan. You knew about the people, the leader -- the fighters -- the Israeli came to Europe to fight the German. They each know about the other one. And when we came to Israel, they took us on beautiful -- they gave us right away a house. They gave us everything what they could, what they had. And '\u00b0 Jacob Boldo we made a living."

One was saying to the other one, and the other one was telling the other one, and that's what we knew about everything. But we couldn't help nothing. The helping hands was that the Bielskis gave so many people life in the forest. They were keeping them and feeding them. And you know that from the people when they came to the forest from Lida, they were people came were 15 years, 16 years, 17 years, young boys. And then now, they went out in the forest, they came to the United States, to Canada, they billionaires. And they were helping other ones here, too. Because they learn a lesson, that you have to help somebody if you need. And they give many, many, many thing to help people to stand on their feet. All over the world you have partisan house, in Australia, in Canada, in Johannesburg, in Africa. Many, many.

And they asking, \u201cYou need something?\u201d This is something what you put it in when they were young when you will not put it in, you will not have it. The same thing like parents. You have children, you teach them what is good and what is bad, and even if they are not doing this right away, they will do it later, because they remember what mother and father taught them, how you have to behave.

And another sister was too in the city, were going to school. The other ones were small children and they were in the house. They had always a teacher for them at home. They couldn't afford to send them out. And mother was working, and father was working, and the brothers were working. And they made a living. They put -- made the flours and market it with another boy, with the son, took the flour to Novogrudok. And they were selling the flours. This is the living. They had a garden near the house. They had water enough, so they have a garden and all the vegetables they had. I don't think they had fruits, but vegetables. And they had a little fish in the water, and a chicken and eggs \u2014 plain, but healthy living. You see, when you are living like that, 1f you can -- if 10 brothers can grow up, six-two, so probably food was good. They had always a woman from the village which she was helping her -- the mother. And there was a lot of love between them. Father was crazy about the mother. And he should be, because she was working very hard, more than him. This I know. I never saw them. I once asked my mother, \"Mommy, do you remember this lady from the village?\" She said, \"I never knew them, but I know they were a very honest family.\" And everybody who came to the mill to ask for something, they were helping them. Because in the village there were only five houses, four from the villages and one house was their's. So they were very poor, \u00b0 Velvel Bielski the people from the village, the village -- five houses. So they were always coming to ask for a little flour, for a couple of pennies to lend them. He was -- always had a open house for them. Maybe they stood. They were a member. But there were many from other villages that were a little farther. They came first to tell them that the brothers beat up somebody when the German camp. Came to beat up them and they tell them that the brothers are Communist. And they were not Communist, but they wanted, you know, to take away the mill with everything, and they brought in the German. And they took them away, the mother and father and two brothers. But they\u2019re not alive no more. When they went already to the forest, they took -- they invited them and killed them all with their children with everybody. They were -- everybody had afraid of them. They knew what they did. You understand? I was very sick in the partisan. I was so sick. I was not prepared for the winter. I was not prepared for the living. And I had blood in my bladder. And the doctor said that I have to have a warm bed. I have to have a couple of times, because I was so sick, I couldn't walk, I couldn't talk, nothing. So there was not far a big mill from flours with a family. And there they had a beautiful daughter and to the daughter they came, the Germans. And Zus took me there to the mill and said to her, \"This is my wife. You have to take care of her. She is very sick.\" And they took care of me. They put me in a place that nobody saw me. And she brought me - she cooked for me, she gave me beds, the mother. And I heard the Germans laughing and drinking and eating. And I was there 10 days and nobody touch me. I am still alive. They took care of me only because they had afraid of the Bielskis. If not, I would not be alive because I had blood all over. This is from the winter."

And this was already night, so they decided to sleep over by the Belarus. In this time, one from the villages saw that the Jewish partisan are by the Belarus, so he gave it to him a letter to the German, the Belarus. \u201c\u201cYou should come right away.\u201d They drink a lot, and they were very tired. They had a very good day. So the German came and they killed them all. Only two -- one from the boys, when he saw the German and were -- blood all over. You know, in the villages you have a big, big stove, and under the stove are the chickens sitting. The chickens are sitting under the stove because there 1s warm. So he saw that he doesn't have nowhere to go. So he went into the place where the chickens are and he -- they spared him. The German went away. And he got out and he said, \u201cWhat did you do with my friends? Why did you went to the German?\u201d What we did to you?\u201d So he took and he killed them, too, the Belarus. This another man from the villages came and he said -- repeated this to Kozlowksi. Kozlowksi was our man. Whoever came from the ghetto, he was holding him till somebody came to pick him up. And he told this to the Bielskis, because we didn't know nothing. Everybody were died. So this took only about five or 10 days and the Bielskis, Asael, his brother, I don't think Zus was \u2014 Zus was not, I think. Anyway, the Bielskis, they came and they said to him, \"Boys, what did you do?\" He said, \"I didn't do nothing.

So they tried to not to go to the army. They did something, or bought something that -- but few of them they went to the army. And they -- when they came to the partisan, they were already -- they knew how to behave in the army. So when the people who had already about 1,200, 300, so the Bielskis, they divided them in groups. It\u2019s was too much one group. So everybody was the commander of a group. A group had about 20 people, 25 people. So the people what they were in the army, they were the commanders of the group. And they were listening to them, because they had afraid. This was a discipline. Because without the discipline, you couldn't do nothing. They were complaining, sure, they were complaining. Who is not complaining? If somebody is eating a piece of meat and you are watching him to eat meat, and you eat only a piece of bread, so sure they were complaining. They said, \u201cHe went for a \u2014 for to take the food, and he was eating the food by himself.\u2019 That was not true. But maybe he put a little more for him. So they were complaining. They were complaining that at night nobody were asleep. There were a couple of people near the groups; they were watching if the German are not coming. There were about five or six people, they were watching. So they were complaining, \u201cHow come he didn't stay a whole week at night? He was asleeping, and I was staying.\u201d This was, too. So they said to him, the Bielskis, \u201cHe is the commander. Whatever he will say, that what you have to do it.\u201d And they got used to that. They had trouble, too, there. They had. All the groups had trouble, sometimes. But this is minor. That's nothing."

So the Bielskis was complaining. \u201cThey took away our food. They took away our horses. They took away some, some other things what we were taking this for our partisan.\u201d So Platon was very smart. He said, \u201cListen, you Bielskis, you are a Jew. You have to remember that you have to fight. You have to fight with them for your survival. After the war, we will then see what we can do.\u201d So -- but we had trouble, too, with Platon. He said, \"Are you grabbing too much food?\" \u201cWhat are we grabbing? Grabbing only bread. But we are fighting the German.\u201d The same thing, maybe more than that. But later, in \u201843 when they separated, the 150 whatever, and they make Ordzonikidze with Zus. Zus went to them -- Aleks. So they didn't believe that he will be partial to the Bielskis otriad. You see, this 1s the boys were from the Bielskis otriad, from Bielskis Brigade. You understand? But they didn't believe him that he will be more partial to Platon than the Bielskis brother. So they put Panchenko -- not Panchenko -- yeah, Panchenko, I think. Right? Panchenko, and he was the commander and Zus was after him. But they were working very hard and very good. Once they had incident with another group of partisan. I told you about it. They took away the horses, and the rifles, everything. And Panchenko came in and he said, \"What happened?\" One Russian commander, he took the rifle and wanted to shoot to Alex, so Alex took out his revolver and Panchenko came in between and he pushed them together. And he was very nice with him, Alex. They did everything together, and very good. They were working very good. We didn't have -- only that\u2019s was the only one, Panchenko. Then when Zus, he was the commander of the intelligence of the whole forest for the Russian, and for everything. So they were working very good."

He did a very good job, and a very big job, because you could not go to fight them if you didn't know what they doing there. He never go get by himself. He went always with 10, 15 people on horses.

Because one day, I remember this was in the beginning of \u201844, Platon came with commanders from Moscow. And they went to look for the partisan, how they were working, and how they were doing and everything, and the German came in. They were surrounding them around, around, and around. They couldn't go out from there. So then Asael, his brother, and Alex, they went to see something. And they saw what happening, so they took him out, but 10 people from the Moscow. This was because they knew how to go out from the roads. You cannot -- you would not be able to use one road. Because even not the markets there was a road, but they knew. I am telling you, they knew. They were looking on the tree and they knew where to go out, how to go out. And they had a small brother, Aaron. He is 13 years old. He knew better than them.

And they killed them, all 50 of them, in the middle of the marketplace. This was a small city, Novogrudok, with a marketplace where everybody is coming, Thursday and Wednesdays. And they killed them. The other ones should be afraid. Tuvia was there in the city, in Novogrudok. He went for something. And the German never killed before. So they ask him who are you? They didn't have to ask him, because the other one -- somebody told he is a Jew. They hit him very well. They beat him up terrible. He had the first thing that you saw the German. And they told him to sit here, not to run in no place. It was a little dark, and he said to himself, \u201c\u201cWhat am I doing here? If they will kill me, let them kill me when I will not see it. But to sit and wait for them?\u201d And he run away. So this when he came in, already Alex and Asael saw him the first time after two, three weeks. They were already in the forest. He came into the forest and he said, \"I am not going no more. I am staying with you.\" This is the first encounter with the German. He never went.

They were young people. They were fighting with them. They were doing everything what they told them. And because of them, there are the Bielskis partisan otriad. Because without them, I don't know. What do you think? Nothing. Whoever will survive, survive, and that's the end of that. And like that a whole generations, two, three generations are still alive because of the Bielskis brothers. And all over the world are they, all over the world. And sometimes we are coming in touch with them for a wedding from the grandchildren. The wedding. And they said, \u201cListen to me, what would be without the Bielskis? What would -- we would not have children, and grandchildren, nothing. We have to thank them.\u201d But not always was like that. No. But when you getting older and smarter and you see many things in other perspectives. You didn't see this before, but now, when you going to bar mitzvah, you going to a wedding for your grandchild and you think, \u201cListen I did it. I did it with the help of the Bielskis.\u201d This is something. Something. They are in the army, they are all over, professors, doctors. Everything you have. Every -- many, many doctors. And they said, \u201cI am giving all of my life for the poor, for the old.\u201d And they are like that. Many. They going away to Israel in a kibbutz. You know what\u2019s a kibbutz? And they working there and they trying everythin. They put everything aside here the money, and they working there, \u201cbecause I have to remember what they did for my parents once. People -- brother Bielskis, what they didn't know even us.\u201d And this something. Something when you are going out and you see all of them on a wedding or something. How the young generation is dancing and singing and comes a professor from Harva-- or from this \u2014 or from Columbia University and said, \u201cWait a second\u201d -- we had a 50 anniversary, me and Alex, two years ago and came two professors, I never heard about them, I never knew them \u2014 \u201cI have to remind you of something. Remember one thing, because of\u201d -- the other brothers are not alive. He said, \u201cBecause of the brothers, and Zusia, we are still here. And we have our families, and thanks to him.\u201d This is something, you know, when you are sitting and you hear this. You know, your heart is pounding, pounding. You think, \u201cReally, was it like that?\u201d And this was really like that."
