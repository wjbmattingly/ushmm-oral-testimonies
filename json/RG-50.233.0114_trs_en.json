His doctor degree and his special field was predecessor of Shakespeare. Ben Johnson, Marlowe, Thompson (?) and all these people. When he was young, his special field was English literature. Later, the language teaching, the languages and he was very active. He taught in different courses for adult people, also private. He gave private lessons."

He wrote a lot of grammar textbooks which was used all over the country for high schools and also some others which would be used by everybody. As a matter of fact, it is a shame that in spite of the fact that my father was a teacher of the English language, I don\u2019t speak it better. My English is not very good, of course, you know how it 1s, being a child, it is always difficult to learn from his own parents."

He died when I was five years old so I don\u2019t have much memories about him. Only I know stories going on in the family, that he was an awful person, stingy, stingy person.

I remember when I was a child, she used to light the candles on Friday evening. I remember it and we had a very nice candleholder and some of the china or something. One day it broke and she stopped to do it. It was not a kind of being religious, just a kind of religion."

On Yom Kippur, how do you call it? Just a second. Anyhow, religion was not an issue in our family. That\u2019s interesting, maybe I can speak about it, but what\u2019s interesting, my mother came -- her father was a physician and he came from a very simple family from the countryside where I think there were ten brothers and sisters. When he was a child, they sent it away because they didn\u2019t have money. They told him that he should go to one relative and from there to another one. Somehow, he managed to finish the university. He became a physician. He had five children. My mother was the brightest. She finished and got degree in Budapest. She was an outstanding student and I still have her book. I don\u2019t know how you call it, where all the grades are written."

I\u2019m very proud of her, excellent professors she had. Unfortunately, when they married, it was in 1914, the war came. After the war, it was impossible to have jobs. A Jewish couple couldn\u2019t have jobs from the state, two teachers. My father had the job and my mother was fired. So she didn\u2019t work as a teacher. Some years and then she stopped. She had also private lectures. Unfortunately she died very early. She was fifty only in \u00b041, just before the war. She was ill. I had a sister, an older sister. She was born in 1918, May 15 and she could enter the university. It was not easy because also as I\u2019ve already mentioned, there was no law against Jews, however the policy was not to be accepted. However, since my father was a teacher and had a lot of friends and connections, he entered the university. She studied chemistry but never worked as a chemist, a chemical engineer. She got involved, very early, as a student into the communist movement. In \u201943, there was already doings of war. And very many young communists were put in jail. She was also condemned to three years, in \u201943. In the jail, she got ill, she got tuberculosis. Maybe that was her luck because on this basis we could get her out from the jail temporarily and when the Germans came into the country, the German invasion in \u00b044, the first thing was that all communists were taken. She was not registered because she was registered as somebody who is in the jail so nobody was looking for her. That was the way how she escaped. Never cured perfectly so she was working, and then again in a sanatorium and so and so. Finally in \u201975, she died."

She had also a document as a refugee from Transylvania and she just -- I don\u2019t know was recommended or in the newspaper -- she rented a room, a private room in a family house. The only danger was that somebody recognized her or was suspicious whether she is a hidden Jew. If they called the police, and looked after the documents, they are real. It was very difficult to check whether it was a real document or not because very often it was a real document. Only from Transylvania."

Also this other grandfather died also very early. He saved some money and bought a house in Budapest. He had the intention that he will live together with us and my parents will take care for him until he lives a full life. So we can live together. What happened before we could move into the house, he died. He was old already but he got leukemia and that\u2019s very quick. Then the sisters and brothers from my mother wanted their part. My parents didn\u2019t want to sell the house and to give them money. They agreed they will pay the rest for these brothers and sisters.

It was really wonderful. Of course, I didn\u2019t know about these problems with my parents. The house was too large because it was actually for my grandparents from father\u2019s side and for grandfather from mother\u2019s side and everybody died and we stayed there alone.

They could get food there and the girls can live there. That was in her mind. My mother had an excellent sense for business, so had my father, as me, too, yes, as I too. As a consequence there was this boarding house there, all facilities and everything, just no girls came, nobody came. One day somebody came, because it was really a very nice part of Budapest and the gardens, as I told you, and in summer it\u2019s ideal, so one day somebody came and asked if they cannot get a room there to live. Who had vacation . Since there were empty rooms, my mother told yes, why not? After a while people came to spend their holidays, vacations there."

I remember all the time, it was, I was very desperate because it meant that my mother was involved in this business and she didn\u2019t have time enough for me. I was jealous for these guests and I always was complaining that well -- to hell with these guests and you should care for me. Finally it was a very nice time. My sister was eight years older than I was and we were very, very close to each other. She had a fianc\u00e9 who was a mechanical engineer. He was very good with me and watched interest for signs in me. I had all this kind of attention; from father\u2019s side, the languages; from mother\u2019s side, mathematics; from sister, the chemistry; from her fianc\u00e9, the engineering; but mainly mathematics was my first interest. Just I wanted to show that in this period, it was very nice. You ask whether we were religious or not. I had no idea what it was, Jew or not Jewish. The first time I had experience in this respect was when I was enrolled into primary school and religion was compulsory. There was a list and they ask these persons should go to this room. I went there and found myself in a big room. There were all the pupils there, not only from the first grade but all four. They started to pray, prayer and I didn\u2019t understand a single word. It was Hebrew and I didn\u2019t know what is is Hebrew. I didn\u2019t know what is Jew; I just saw that something different. I was told I am a bright boy, that I\u2019m smart. I was so much confused by the whole fact and I went home and asked what happened. Then they explained me what it was. This is about --."

            "question": "Then you studied Hebrew?",
            "answer": "Then I studied Hebrew, I didn\u2019t mind it. My teacher asked me, not me but the class, well is anybody who doesn\u2019t pray every day? Since I was taught at home that you have to be always sincere and tell always the truth and you must not lie; of course, I was the only boy who said that I don\u2019t pray, never. She started to make reproaches, why not? I don\u2019t mind, I don\u2019t think of it. Then, you don\u2019t think that G__ will not think of you? I would have never thought about it! Finally as a consequence, I realize -- this 1s what I learned there -- that in certain cases it\u2019s better if you lie. That was my first lesson, not to be sincere. Never left the religion, I\u2019ve never denied that I was a Jew. Of course, now I don\u2019t. It\u2019s a different thing, that\u2019s a tradition. Moskir (Yiskor) what I wanted. Have you ever heard what is Moskir? Moskir is a part of a holiday prayer which is only three times a year, I think, but most important in Yom Kippur. You know what Yom Kippur is. Moskir, even people who are absolutely not religions, they go to Moskir because this 1s again a tradition, to think of the parents. To pray for them, the parents, or just to think of them. My father who had no idea about praying at all, he went to Moskir and my mother too just because his parents went to Moskir. You know, you understand the situation. This is really, I think you will agree, it is the most important event in all the religion. This is really what we were taught. That was my childhood and then I went to high school. I knew, I was aware of the fact that if I want to enter the university, then I have to be the best in school. So I was always the best without any effort because it was a public school and all the other students were not very bright so it was -- not the best school, yes. It was also not a bad one. Anyhow, it was not difficult for me to be the best but I knew that I have to be the best. In \u201943 I graduated in high school with excellences, all the best grades. Is it interesting this?"

I finished second in the high school among the students who just finished the high school from all over the country, from all the schools in the country. There I participated in this competition in physics and I got fours, a prize. So I was among the best and it was something. I hoped to enter the university, or if there is any chance to enter the university, then I can get it because I was the best in the school. But it was \u201943 already and we had already two laws and it was very restricted and so I didn\u2019t get into the university. I wanted to become an engineer which was even more difference, it was always the most difficult for a Jew to be enrolled to a technical university. So out of question, well what to do? Then I will work, that\u2019s also a good experience, a good opportunity. If I want to become a mechanical engineer, I go into a factory and there I will learn. I will become an apprentice. I went to this t in Ujpest, and ---,"

Until June, I could work there and my luck was -- I was lucky because I had to go into the forced labor camp in June. Otherwise, as Eva already pointed out, people who were working in Tung ---, later she will be taken to Auschwitz together out of population of Ujpest. Since in June, I was already in the labor camp so I could escape this experience. Just I wanted to tell you, it may be interesting, March 19 that was my father\u2019s birthday. Then my sister was in the sanatorium because I mentioned that she could get _.. We visited her and that was a sanatorium outside of Budapest but very close to the border and it was a very nice place. We went there in the morning and my sister told us what happened, because we didn\u2019t know about it, the German invasion, but they had the connection, the telephone, everything. She told us you should return as soon as possible because maybe they will close the border and you should go through the woods. Not the road, the regular road and don\u2019t take the bus. We did it and that was our luck because this path in the forest was free, was no control. On the road, the regular road, the bus, they didn\u2019t let the Jews anymore enter the city. If they had caught us, then 1t would have been worse. That was the last visit for us both, my father to see my sister. As you know, each day and each week, it became worse and worse. In June I had to go to the labor camp, I was really happy. Yes, because then there was a community, how to say, and I knew that in general the army was not as bad as the gendarmerie. We didn\u2019t know what happened in other countries, in Austria, in Poland and so on. Being under the army, we could have more safe and secure position. Of course, it was no assurance for it, but in the army there were better people than otherwise."

Sometimes we told each other that if we knew that we survive, then it wouldn\u2019t be so bad, like a summer vacation. We had good food. There was a very good organization, food. From this respect it was not bad. It was in summer. What I thought interesting, probably you know from history, that August 23, Romania went to the Soviet side. That meant that the war and the front came very close. When we finished this second railroad, next week, later it turned out, next week another b came or a group of locals and they blew up. What we were -- that\u2019s an irony...we were working so much and so hard in summer. Then they blew up. That was a change of the whole situation.

We had to withdraw, not we, but the Hungarian and the German army, had to withdraw their troops in such a hurry, they couldn\u2019t get into these trenches. They had to withdraw everybody. We had to march all day long. Now, we were very tired because all the night we were working, all the day we were marching. In the evening we said some of them, we were kept together, that now that\u2019s enough. We have to have arest. We stepped from the street into a forest and we lay there and we slept there. We didn\u2019t know what happened and it could have been very dangerous; in the morning the soldiers find us and say you are deserters, right? We could have said well, there was such a turmoil, everybody had to leave so we are looking for our battalion. We don\u2019t know where they are. Our luck was that the soldiers were so very eager for their own life and security; they were afraid from the enemy. The only thing what they were concerned about was the kitchen and the food. They take the kitchen and the food and the storage and run in front. Some other cases, could have happened that they go behind us and if somebody wants to step down, then they kill them. Our soldiers were not so every eager for us, they were eager for themselves. As it turned out, we were left behind. When we stepped down in the night, all the Hungarian and German troops left and in the morning, we were there. We didn\u2019t know so we went further by the pretended intention to look for our lost battalion."

That meant that we are Jews, they knew it, everybody who wanted to know it. We went in this intention to look for our battalion. We didn\u2019t find any Hungarian or German soldiers but in two hours, the first Romanian soldiers who were from this particular village -- also the population told us, don\u2019t be silly, don\u2019t go, wait here, our people are here close to us. We were there without any effort, we were lucky. It was October 10 and this terrible thing in Hungary happened in October 15 when the Arrow Cross people, these ultra- rightist people took over the power. That was that. Then we were also lucky, in certain places, people were put into prison and took time until they could figure out that they are Jews and not enemies. Sometimes the Russians, especially, didn\u2019t care for it and they took them somewhere. It was not a security. I remember just telling the joke when we were speaking among each other, when we were in this forced labor camp. I always told them as soon as possible I want to go over to them. Most people want to go to Budapest. What do you want in Budapest? What do you expect there? It\u2019s nothing there and maybe we don\u2019t find anybody there because we knew already that from the countryside everybody was taken. That was also what we expected from Budapest. But if we go on the other side, there is hope to survive. Some of them told me, yes and what do you want to do there? Then I told them, well, the worst case I go to Amskin. I will be at the university as a servant. It 1s even better to be a servant at Amskin Universitity than in {\u201c\u201cAmskin is a very very good university. It is a very high \u2014\u2018}. High -level university. They were always laughing, made jokes, poor Pal, he wants to be a university servant. Now, of course, it is easy to laugh about it but at the time it was not so. Finally, the 10\" of October that we were liberated then we went to Turdo. There we got some documents and in two days, the first train went to Bucharest. Then I told, Well, I\u2019m fed up with the war and everything. I don\u2019t want to be here close to the front but again most colleagues wanted to go with the frontier to Budapest I don\u2019t want to stay so close to the frontier, let\u2019s go back. I went the first train to Bucharest and I waited there until I could return. I returned to Budapest in April. I lived there six months. I learned Jurmanian. I lived with a family. I was working as an electrician in some private business. I was lucky. Personally for me. "

I found my sister who was in a sanatorium because her condition was not good enough, but of course, we were very glad to meet again. That was April 26. In five days I went to the university and I asked when it starts. They told me that one hour ago it started. I made a case I can get into the first class. I went. Everybody told me, are you silly? What do you want to live off? You don\u2019t have any background. What is your imagination? Then I have to laugh because I told you, you are silly because if I survive all this terrible times, do you think that now I\u2019m going to starve.

My friends and colleagues learned about my situation and they sent me pupils, students whom I could tutor and soon that was the way how I made my existence. It was very good, very nice.
