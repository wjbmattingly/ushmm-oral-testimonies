I\u2122m very proud of her, excellent professors she had. Unfortunately, when they married, it was in 1914, the war came. After the war, it was impossible to have jobs. A Jewish couple couldn\u2122t have jobs from the state, two teachers. My father had the job and my mother was fired. So she didn\u2122t work as a teacher. Some years and then she stopped. She had also private lectures. Unfortunately she died very early. She was fifty only in \u212241, just before the war. She was ill. I had a sister, an older sister. She was born in 1918, May 15 and she could enter the university. It was not easy because also as I\u2122ve already mentioned, there was no law against Jews, however the policy was not to be accepted. However, since my father was a teacher and had a lot of friends and connections, he entered the university. She studied chemistry but never worked as a chemist, a chemical engineer. She got involved, very early, as a student into the co mmunist movement. In \u212243, there was already doings of war. And very many young communists were put in jail. She was also condemned to three years, in \u212243. In the jail, she got ill, she got tuberculosis. Maybe that was her luck because on this basis we could get her out from the jail temporarily and when the Germans came into the country, the German invasion in \u212244, the first thing was that all communists were taken. She was not registered because she was registered as somebody who is in the jail so nobody was looking for her. That was the way how she escap ed. Never cured perfectly so she was working, and then again in a sanatorium and so and so. Finally in \u212275, she died."

It was really wonderful. Of course, I didn\u2122t know about these problems with my parents. The house was too large because it was actually for my grandparents from father\u2122s side and for grandfather from mother\u2122s side and everybody di ed and we stayed there alone.

On e day somebody came, because it was really a very nice part of Budapest and the gardens, as I told you, and in summer it\u2122s ideal, so one day somebody came and asked if they cannot get a room there to live.

I remember all the time, it was, I was very desperate because it meant that my mother was involved in this business and she didn\u2122t have time enough for me. I was jealous for these guests and I alwa ys was complaining that well -- to hell with these guests and you should care for me. Finally it was a very nice time. My sister was eight years older than I was and we were very, very cl ose to each other. She had a fianc\u00e9 who was a mechanical engineer. He was very good with me and watched interest for signs in me. I had all this kind of attention; from fath er\u2122s side, the languages; from mo ther\u2122s side, mathematics; from sister, the chemistry; from her fianc\u00e9, the engi neering; but mainly mathematics was my first interest. Just I wanted to show that in this period, it was very nice. You ask whether we were religious or not. I had no idea what it was, Jew or not Jewish. The first time I had experience in this respect was when I was enrolled into primary school and religion was compulsory. There was a list and they ask these persons should go to this room. I went there and found myself in a big room. There were all the pupils there, not only from the first grade but all four. They started to pray, prayer and I didn\u2122t unde rstand a single word. It was Hebrew and I didn\u2122t know what is is Hebrew. I didn\u2122t know what is Je w; I just saw that something different. I was told I am a bright boy, that I\u2122m smart. I was so much confused by the whole fact and I went home and asked what happened. Then they expl ained me what it was. This is about --."

            "answer": "Then I studied Hebrew, I didn\u2122t mind it. My teacher asked me, not me but the class, well is anybody who doesn\u2122t pray every day? Since I was taught at home that you have to be always sincere and tell always the truth and you must not lie; of course, I was the only boy who said that I don\u2122t pray, never. She started to make reproaches, why not? I don\u2122t mind, I don\u2122t think of it. Then, you don\u2122t think that G__ will not think of you? I would have never thought about it! Finally as a consequence, I realize -- this is what I learned there -- that in certain cases it\u2122s better if you lie. That was my first lesson, not to be si ncere. Never left the religion, I\u2122ve never denied that I was a Jew. Of course, now I don\u2122t. It\u2122s a different th ing, that\u2122s a tradition. Moskir (Yiskor) what I wanted. Have you ever heard what is Moskir? Moskir is a part of a holiday prayer which is only three times a year, I thi nk, but most important in Yom Kippur. You know what Yom Kippur is. Moskir, even people who ar e absolutely not religions, they go to Moskir because this is again a tradition, to think of the pare nts. To pray for them, the parents, or just to think of them. My father who had no idea about praying at all, he went to Moskir and my mother too just because his parents went to Moskir. You know, you understand the situation. This is really, I think you will agree, it is the mo st important event in all the religion. This is really what we were taught. That was my ch ildhood and then I went to high school. I knew, I was aware of the fact that if I want to enter the university, then I have to be the best in school. So I was always the best ______ without any effo rt because it was a public school and all the other students were not very bright so it was -- not the best school, yes. It was also not a bad one. Anyhow, it was not difficult for me to be the be st but I knew that I have to be the best. In \u212243 I graduated in high school with excellences, all the best grades. Is it interesting this?"

I finished second in the high school among the students who just finished the high school from all over the country, from all the schools in the country. There I participated in this competition in physic s and I got fours, a prize. So I was among the best and it was something. I hoped to enter the univ ersity, or if there is any chance to enter the university, then I can get it because I was the best in the school. But it was \u212243 already and we had already two laws and it was very restricted and so I didn\u2122t get into the university. I wanted to become an engineer which was even more diff erence, it was always the most difficult for a Jew to be enrolled to a technical university. So out of question, well what to do? Then I will work, that\u2122s also a good experience, a good opportuni ty. If I want to become a mechanical engineer, I go into a factory and there I will learn. I will become an apprentice.

Since in June, I was already in the labor camp so I could escape this experience. Just I wanted to tell you, it may be interesting, March 19 that was my father\u2122s birthday. Then my sister was in the sanatori um because I mentioned that she could get ____. We visited her and that was a sanatorium outside of Budapest but very close to the border and it was a very nice place. We went there in the morning and my sister told us what happened, because we didn\u2122t know about it, the German invasion, but they had the connection, the telephone, everything. She told us you should retu rn as soon as possible because maybe they will close the border and you should go through the woods. Not the road, the regular road and don\u2122t take the bus. We did it and that was our luck because this path in the forest was free, was no control. On the road, the regular road, the bus, they didn\u2122t let the Jews anymore enter the city. If they had caught us, then it would have been worse. Th at was the last visit for us both, my father to see my sister. As you know, each day and each week, it became worse and worse. In June I had to go to the labor camp, I was really happy. Yes, because then there was a community, how to say, and I knew that in genera l the army was not as bad as the gendarmerie. We didn\u2122t know what happened in other countries, in Austria, in Poland and so on. Being under the army, we could have more safe and secure position.

            "answer": "Came, yes. The Romanians and the Soviet ar my. Actually, what happened, we were working for this trench and I told you in the morning the attack came. We had to withdraw, not we, but the Hungarian and the German army, had to withdr aw their troops in such a hurry, they couldn\u2122t get into these trenches. They had to withdraw everybody. We had to march all day long. Now, we were very tired because all the night we were working, all the day we were marching. In the evening we said some of them, we were kept to gether, that now that\u2122s enough. We have to have a rest. We stepped from the street into a forest and we lay there and we slept there. We didn\u2122t know what happened and it could have been very dangerous; in the morning the soldiers find us and say you are deserters, right? We could have said well, there was such a turmoil, everybody had to leave so we are looking for our battalion. We don\u2122t know where they are. Our luck was that the soldiers were so very eager for their own life and security; they were afraid from the enemy. The only thing what they were concer ned about was the kitchen and the food. They take the kitchen and the food and the storage and run in front. Some other cases, could have happened that they go behind us and if somebody wa nts to step down, then they kill them. Our soldiers were not so every eager for us, they were eager for themselves. As it turned out, we were left behind. When we stepped down in the night, all the Hungarian and German troops left and in the morning, we were there. We didn\u2122t know so we went further by the pretended intention to look for our lost battalion."

                " We were identifiable -- we didn\u2122t have to wear the stars, the David stars, that was a rude thing, but we had to wear a yellow ribbon here. That meant that we are Jews, they knew it, everybody who wanted to know it. We went in this intent ion to look for our battalion. We didn\u2122t find any Hungarian or German soldiers but in two hours, the first Romanian soldiers who were from this particular village -- also the population told us, don\u2122t be silly , don\u2122t go, wait here, our people are here close to us. We were there without any effo rt, we were lucky. It was October 10 and this terrible thing in Hungary happened in October 15 when the Arrow Cross people, these ultrarightist people took over the power. That was that. Then we were also lucky, in certain places, people were put into prison and took time until they could figure out that they are Jews and not enemies. Sometimes the Russians, especially, didn \u2122t care for it and they took them somewhere. It was not a security. I remember just tell ing the joke when we were speaking among each other, when we were in this forced labor camp. I always told them as soon as possible I want to go over to them. Most people want to go to B udapest. What do you want in Budapest? What do you expect there? It\u2122s nothing there a nd maybe we don\u2122t find anybody there because we knew already that from the countryside everybody wa s taken. That was also what we expected from Budapest. But if we go on the other side, ther e is hope to survive. Some of them told me, yes and what do you want to do there? Then I told them, well, the worst case I go to Amskin. I will be at the university as a servant. It is ev en better to be a servant at Amskin Universitity than in _____ {\ufb01Amskin is a very very good unive rsity. It is a very high \u0152\ufb01}. High -level university. They were always laughing, made j okes, poor Pal, he wants to be a university servant. Now, of course, it is easy to laugh about it but at the time it wa s not so. Finally, the 10th of October that we were liberated then we went to Turdo. There we got some documents and in two days, the first train went to Bucharest. Then I told, Well, I\u2122m fed up with the war and everything. I don\u2122t want to be here close to the front but again most colleagues wanted to go with the frontier to Budapest I don\u2122t want to st ay so close to the frontier, let\u2122s go back. I went the first train to Bucharest and I waited there until I could return. I returned to Budapest in April. I lived there six months. I learned Jurmanian. I lived with a family. I was working as an electrician in some private busine ss. I was lucky. Personally for me. "

I didn\u2122t have anything, I felt myself as a Hungarian, a Hunga rian Jew. I was not a Zionist; I didn\u2122t want to leave for Israel. It was enough for me the expe rience in the labor camp, to be together with three hundred Jews. Among them there were terribl e people, I have to confess. I didn\u2122t know what happened with my father, with my sister, with all other relatives. What happened with them -- as I told you, my sister was hiding and su rvived in this way. When she was liberated, she went into the Party, the Communists were there and she was working for them. My father, well in October 15, when this Arrow Cross people took the power, five days later, October 20, they went from house to house. They lived in a marked house with David\u2122s star."

I found my sister who was in a sanatorium because her condition was not good enough, but of course, we were very glad to meet again. That was April 26. In five days I went to the university and I asked when it starts. They told me that one hour ago it started. I made a case I can get into the first cl ass. I went. Everybody told me, are you silly? What do you want to live off? You don\u2122t have any background. What is your imagination?

My friends and colleagues learned about my situation and they sent me pupils, students whom I could tutor and soon that was th e way how I made my existence. It was very good, very nice.
