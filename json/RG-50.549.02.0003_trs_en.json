I could trace my family back to the 17th and perhaps to the 16 th century, and they probably lived there all the time. Perhaps they lived in Vienna, were expelled from there, and then they came back. And it is not impossible, but that\u2122s just a guess, that my parents and the Jews in this area were there in the Roman times, because the Roman -- the limit of the Roman empire was in Vienna, called vie -- viento bona. My father was a glazier, but he had a hardware shop and he was affluent. My mother and her family came from the little town where I was raised, but they were very Viennese. And the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 3whole population there was oriented towards Vienna. Vienna was the great city from which all the good things, and perhaps e-even bad things, emanated.
