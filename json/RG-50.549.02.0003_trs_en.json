I could trace my family back to the 17\" and perhaps to the 16\" century, and they probably lived there all the time. Perhaps they lived in Vienna, were expelled from there, and then they came back. And it is not impossible, but that\u2019s just a guess, that my parents and the Jews in this area were there in the Roman times, because the Roman -- the limit of the Roman empire was in Vienna, called vie -- viento bona. My father was a glazier, but he had a hardware shop and he was affluent. My mother and her family came from the little town where I was raised, but they were very Viennese. And the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 \u00b0 whole population there was oriented towards Vienna. Vienna was the great city from which all the good things, and perhaps e-even bad things, emanated. In 1918, this part of Moravia was annexed by the Czechs. The Czech Republic was founded in 1918, but my family, as well as the neighbors and most of the po -- of the population experienced a very strong affinity to Vienna and to Austria."

And he, like all the grownups who lived in my time were against the war, were for democracy, were against the Hapsburgs. So now, as I read history, it turns out that the Hapsburgs were really protectors of the Jews. They were not against the Jews. They used the Jews and protected them, that is to say, at least in the last two centuries, as least since Joseph the second, who contributed to the emancipation of the Jews who lived between 1780 and 1790.

I think it\u2019s very difficult to say. But it was also a tragic time. We met in May 1939 for the first time, the war broke out at the beginning of September.

When we were deported to Germany, the question was, why are we deported. And while we thought of ourselves as workers who will have to work, why do they dis -- deport old people and children? What sense does it make? These people cannot work. And there, I personally envisaged that the Germans are going to establish a slave county or country or area somewhere in Ukraine, that\u2019s there -- that that is our future. We might be slaves forever, if we survive. And then, you know, there\u2019s another thing, we must not think of it respectively in the sense of drawing conclusion on the basis of knowledge which one acquired only after an event took place.

We USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 \u00b0\u00b0 were absolutely convinced if they want, we were 5,000 in this one camp, they might decide tomorrow they will kill all of us. But that they are going, and are bent, and decided to call -- to kill all Jews, that never occurred to me, and not to the others. I mean that there was the plan of mass ec-ex-extermination, that we didn\u2019t know. End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B"
