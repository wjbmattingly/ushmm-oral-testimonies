My mother and father divorced and saw very little of him. And -- but my mother, I think was loyal to him all the time.

Well, I didn\u2019t want to become a teacher, I wanted to become a nurse. So I stayed home for a whole year and did absolutely nothing. And she finally said to me, \u201cGo, go,\u201d you know. \u201cT\u2019ll pay for it,\u201d because in those days you had to pay for a nursing education. And it was Dad\u2019s responsibility. So, anyhow, make a long story short, I became a nurse and he never congratulated me or anything, until I got in the service. And he wrote me a letter that he wanted to come down and do an article on the nurses, the army nurses. And by the time I Interview with Louise Birch 2 July 15, 1995 got the letter, we were all -- already overseas, living 1n tents. In fact it was [indecipherable] who helped me compose a letter back to my father saying, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to do a story on us. We don't look like nurses, we don\u2019t act like nurses. We\u2019re,\u201d you know, \u201cwe\u2019re living in tents and,\u201d you know, \u201cwalking in mud and not the sterile atmosphere that you think, the white, crisp nurses.\u201d So he dropped the subject.

I had my boyfriend through high school was -- had gone in the service before he was drafted, so -- and he and -- Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Louise Birch 3 July 15, 1995 volunteered for the airborne. He was in the 82nd Airborne Division. And in training we weren\u2019t allowed to be married. And we had been really romantic and he knew he was going overseas and so he got leave and I sneaked out and we got married. Well, his -- his family knew about it and my family knew about it. It was a real simple ceremony and we just had a weekend pass. And that was the last I saw of him. He went o -- he was in the invasion of Sicily and he was mi -- th-that\u2019s a thorn in my side, he was considered an MIA for a year. Then he -- they you\u2019re dead. Not like the MIA\u2019s today that they\u2019re still -- you know, I know that they have to look for these people, but they didn\u2019t look for the boys in the World War Two. And there were many of them that they never found. And unless there\u2019s blue eyed blondes running around Sicily, then I don\u2019t know where he 1s. And -- so I went trying to find some trace of him. I\u2019d written to his chaplain and I\u2019d written to a lieutenant that used to censor our letters and never got any response. Went to the Red Cross, never got any response. So, I finally found -- when I was in the service, and I was stationed down Atlantic City in what they called England General Hospital -- it was one of the big hotels in Atlantic City at the time, they made a hospital. And I found a -- a fellow that was in his company. And so he invited me over to his apartment with his wife and we got talking and he knew that my -- my Hughie had jumped, and he -- cause I wondered, you know, did he even make it over there? And he said, \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that was a\u201d -- I guess that whole operation was a faux pas, you know. They went off of target and whatever. So anyhow, at least I knew that he did his duty, [indecipherable]"

Towards the end of our stay there, things seemed to ease -- you know, maybe because we\u2019d been there long enough to not be so tense, that we were able to talk to some of the patients through an interpreter.

To tell them, you know, they\u2019re begging, \u201cT-Tell America I\u2019m here,\u201d you know. And at that time you couldn\u2019t say exactly where they were, you know, just someplace in Austria was the term you had to use. A-And you couldn\u2019t say exactly what their condition was. When I got back to the States and I must have given my address back at the States, I got a letter from one woman in Evanston, Illinois and she had gotten my letter and sent me a check for 50 dollars, to do something for her brother, it was her brother. And so by this time I\u2019m back in the States, so I wrote back to her exactly where he was, exactly his condition and sent her back the 50 dollars. Hopefully he was still alive. And I said, \u201cContact your Red Cross. Now you know exactly where he was. Whether he\u2019s still there now, I don\u2019t know.\u201d I never heard from the other one that I wrote from, but -- to -- so I -- you know, sometimes I think -- I wonder how he made out.

And the -- the train would stop and start because the tracks were, you know, in repair or -- you know. It was -- it was a -- seemed to me a long ride to where we got. Then there were trucks that took us first to -- I f -- I think they took us first to what we call Camp 20 grand. They had all these little like reppo- deppo\u2019s, which were replacement depots for different units and they were named after cigarettes.

Not quite too far down on the Cape, but some part on the Cape. It\u2019s now a big campground, I guess. And they were great. They had -- you know, welcome home and we slept in -- like it was a huge ward, so we were all together, but there were sheets, the first time we\u2019d had sheets 1n -- oh, months and months and months, we haven\u2019t had a sheet. And it was great. I remember calling my mother, cause you could call whoever you want to call and they had the -- papers had a habit of printing what units were landing when and where and she had seen in the paper that the 131st was coming into New York Harbor at such and such a date. Well, that must have been the first boat that they were loading our stuff on. So she says, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d I said, \u201cUp in Massachusetts someplace, Camp Miles Stand,\u201d -- \u201cYou get right home here.\u201d I said, \u201cHuh? I can\u2019t. I\u2019m still in the army, you know.\u201d \u201cWell, you were supposed to arrive,\u201d -- buppabuppa. I said, \u201cNo, Mother.\u201d So we finally went to Camp Dix and got our leave papers.

Now Woody was in the service longer than I -- girls that had longer service, they had points and you got out by a certain point system. If you were married -- not a widow, but if you were married, if you\u2019d been in the service so long, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, you could be discharged. And we had seven discharged from Camp Polk. Another gal and I got orders to go to San Antone, Texas. Fort Sam Houston, which 1s a huge hospital. When I got down there, hadn\u2019t worked on a ward, didn\u2019t know what to do. Didn\u2019t know how to do anything, actually. Hadn\u2019t worked -- how to make a bed, even. And this young whippersnapper had just gotten in the army and I\u2019m saying, \u201cWell, how do you do this,\u201d and, \u201chow do you do that?\u201d And she -- she thinks, well, I must have just got in the army before she -- you know, after she did and so she\u2019s giving me this [indecipherable]. She says, \u201cWell where were you last month?\u201d I said, \u201cI was over in Germany,\u201d you know. Or where were you when VE Day, that was -- I can remember her saying to me. I said, \u201cI was in Germany.\u201d \u201cIn Germany\u201d? What were you doing there?\u201d So she thought I had just joined the army, acting so dumb, well how do you do this and how do you do that? And so I met my present -- my ex-husband there. He was in the Air Corps and we got married and life starts anew."
