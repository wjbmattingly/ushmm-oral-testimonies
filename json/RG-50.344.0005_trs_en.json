Well, I didn\u2019t want to become a teacher, I wanted to become a nurse. So I stayed home for a whole year and did absolutely nothing. And she finally said to me, \u201cGo, go,\u201d you know. \u201cT\u2019ll pay for it,\u201d because in those days you had to pay for a nursing education. And it was Dad\u2019s responsibility.

And he wrote me a letter that he wanted to come down and do an article on the nurses, the army nurses. And by the time I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And I can alway -- and I had specials around the clock and I can always remember, you know, begging my -- my nurses to, \u201cOh, I'd give you a drink if you were thirsty,\u201d you know, and -- cause I couldn\u2019t have any water, anything to drink and stuff.

And in training we weren\u2019t allowed to be married. And we had been really romantic and he knew he was going overseas and so he got leave and I sneaked out and we got married. Well, his -- his family knew about it and my family knew about it. It was a real simple ceremony and we just had a weekend pass. And that was the last I saw of him. He went o -- he was in the invasion of Sicily and he was mi -- th-that\u2019s a thorn in my side, he was considered an MIA for a year. Then he -- they you\u2019re dead. Not like the MIA\u2019s today that they\u2019re still -- you know, I know that they have to look for these people, but they didn\u2019t look for the boys in the World War Two. And there were many of them that they never found. And unless there\u2019s blue eyed blondes running around Sicily, then I don\u2019t know where he 1s. And -- so I went trying to find some trace of him. I\u2019d written to his chaplain and I\u2019d written to a lieutenant that used to censor our letters and never got any response. Went to the Red Cross, never got any response. So, I finally found -- when I was in the service, and I was stationed down Atlantic City in what they called England General Hospital -- it was one of the big hotels in Atlantic City at the time, they made a hospital. And I found a -- a fellow that was in his company. And so he invited me over to his apartment with his wife and we got talking and he knew that my -- my Hughie had jumped, and he -- cause I wondered, you know, did he even make it over there? And he said, \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that was a\u201d -- I guess that whole operation was a faux pas, you know. They went off of target and whatever. So anyhow, at least I knew that he did his duty, [indecipherable]"

By this time I\u2019m out of school, but I felt so bad, cause I had lied to her, you know, to get this little pass that I had.

But I drove down there once, I must have had a date with somebody that had a Jeep and it was weird, you know, these -- you -- like in a -- almost in the Grand Canyon, these walls and walls of rock, you know.

And when they got to the very top, I don\u2019t know what was up there, more for maybe trucks or something to take these blocks or quarries -- o-of granite someplace else. But it was eerie. And then to drive up there 20 years -- was it 20 le -- years later? Hm. Must have been more than that. But to look down and see all of these tombstones down there in that compound, I thought, \u201cYou son of a gun.\u201d So somebody\u2019s making a good business. So -- even the roadblocks, there was a roadblock between our quarters and Gusen, that of course had been discombobulated for us to go through, but that was built of big blocks of this quarry."

And the -- the train would stop and start because the tracks were, you know, in repair or -- you know. It was -- it was a -- seemed to me a long ride to where we got. Then there were trucks that took us first to -- I f -- I think they took us first to what we call Camp 20 grand. They had all these little like reppo- deppo\u2019s, which were replacement depots for different units and they were named after cigarettes. First we went to Camp 20 grand, then we went to Camp Lucky Strike, which was great. It was up on top of a hill, overlooking the -- the Seine in -- in France, except this was just a huge rockpile. There again, we had to live in tents again. They were pitched on these rocks and we had to wash our hair out of tin cans and we had a good mess hall, which was run by the German POWs. And they would be quite fresh to us, but sometimes they\u2019d say, \u201cNo sugar today for your coffee. No sugar today. No sugar today for your coffee.\u201d Well, I don\u2019t take sugar in my coffee, it didn\u2019t bother me. The other girls -- at night they\u2019d have sugar cookies they\u2019d make for us. You know, they\u2019d try to make up, you know, they -- they would do this on purpose to make something nice for us. So th-they were also trying to be nice. See, I\u2019m still -- had this distrust of the people. And -- I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t like anyone that got too familiar. And we finally found out they had a ship, we were going home.

Well, that must have been the first boat that they were loading our stuff on.
