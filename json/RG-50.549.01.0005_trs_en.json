            "question": "I'm going to speak with you today mostly about the period after the war and liberation, but I do have one question about the time that you spent in concentration camp, which is this: at the period when you were still with your mother and father, did they ever sit you down and, in essence, sort of give you advice on how to survive, try to teach you a survival strategy, or did they themselves know what actually might work in that situation?",
            "answer": "Well, I -- not really in any sort of formal sense, at least, I don't remember it. Of course, as a child, you probably learn much more from observing than you do from being told things. But I do remember my father saying -- when we were -- when he and I were left alone -- that the one thing that was critical was not to eat food that was dirty or contaminated. That's the only sort of thing I remember because a lot of people would try to eat things out of garbage cans, and then of course get sick. He always warned me about that. Otherwise, I really can't think of them sort of telling me \u201cYou should do this or that,\u201d but one of course saw a lot of things that one had to do. I observed my father, who's great strength was that, that you could see that he always thought things out before he did it, and he would not be sort of cowed into Thomas Buergenthal 2 November 28, 1995 Page 2 running but he would make his decision and then stick by it and that was something I noticed, that a lot of people got killed or were caught because they acted too fast. They didn't sort of take account of the environment and then act. That's something he did; he was a master at that."

            "question": "There was a point where you had been separated from your mother and you were able to see your mother briefly, in a concentration camp. Did she say anything at that point, give you any advice?",
            "answer": "No, but, you know, I think both my father and mother sort of knew that I -- I had sort of grown up in the camp. And they probably knew that there wasn't any advice that they could give me that I sort of, that I hadn't already been doing. Really the only advice or the only goal of our life, the long-term goal, was to stay alive, and the short-term goal was to have something to eat that day. And that was -- so survival was the long-term goal. But I really can't remember that they said it, or for that matter that they had to say it. I think they probably knew that I knew what had to be done."

            "question": "In listening to your testimony that you gave on video tape, I was struck by how you were able to be in a situation and make the best of it, for instance, by becoming an errand boy to one of the German soldiers or to a Kapo; or later, right around liberation, you became a mascot to a group of Polish soldiers, and every time there you are 1n those situations. How did you end up in those situations? Thomas Buergenthal 3 November 28, 1995 Page 3",
            "answer": "You know, it's hard to say. I've never thought about it, but as I said, I'd grown up in the camp and it seemed that sort of the -- that there were certain things you had to do in order to be able to survive, and in order to be in the position where you could survive, and those things sort of came naturally. I don't know, I must say I've never thought about it. The mascot part -- this was after liberation -- there that was really not planned at all or\u2014because what happened was that I was liberated and we met these Polish soldiers and they knew that I spoke Polish, and they thought I was Polish, and they took me with them. And then sort of the mascot part came naturally. So I can't claim any credit for having known what I was doing, at that stage."

            "question": "You say that you grew up in the camps, and certainly, when your life was disrupted, you were about five I believe -- and then, you were about ten I believe -- and correct me if I'm wrong, when the last place you were was liberated. How did you grow up, what happened to you, who was the little boy when your life was disrupted, and who was that boy or boy adult when the camps were liberated?",
            "answer": "Well, we, of course, were already on the run from 1939 on, and I remember very little from that period. I was born in 1934, so in '39 I was five years old. I was a scared little boy, that's all I remember. I remember our crossing the border from Czechoslovakia into Poland and worrying that something would happen to my father and knowing my father and mother were very worried about what was going to happen; being fascinated by some of the new languages I heard -- Yiddish for the Thomas Buergenthal 4 November 28, 1995 Page 4 first time in my life in Poland. Really, I didn't start sort of facing the reality of the war and what it meant, and sort of the reality of trying to survive, until probably 1943, because in the ghetto still, when we survived the first in 1942, when they, when they dissolved the ghetto and sent most of the people to Treblinka."

            "question": "This is in Kielce?",
            "answer": "This is in Kielce, in Poland. I was still very much sort of part -- I would do what my parents wanted me to do and I would be the child that did what had to be done. And in '43 I sort of began to be aware that I had to -- even though I was still with my parents -- that I had to do certain things on my own in order to survive. And then, of course, when I was left --"

            "num": 7,
            "question": "Such as?",
            "answer": "Such as, well, for example, when we were in 1943, we were in a work camp, and when that camp was dissolved, the initial thing was that I had to hide in order not to be seen by the Gestapo because they were taking all of the children away. And then what happened, I actually survived this: they saw me of course, we were all lined up on one of these fields in Kielce, and they start pulling me, and my father pulled me back. And then my father took me to the chief of the Gestapo, who was standing in front of everybody, and said to him, \"This is my son.\" And this man looked at me, and I said to him, in German, \"I can work.\" And, you know, it just came out of me. How do you say it in German? \u201cIch kann arbeiten\u2019\u2019? And his response in German Thomas Buergenthal 5 November 28, 1995 Page 5 was \"Na, das wollen wir mal sehen\u201d -- \u201c\u201cLet\u2019s see\u201d -- and he let me live. This was -- I was the only one of the children from that -- from Kielce who survived that way. There were two others who hid in the house where they took all of the children. And that was sort of the beginning of my awakening to the fact that I was going to have to save my own life."

            "num": 8,
            "question": "And in that case, instead of running away or trying not to be noticed, you went right into the belly of the beast. You went right face-to-face with the danger.",
            "answer": "Well, that, in part, that was really my father's doing, who, who, who had sort of analyzed the Germans and knew that you had to often confront them in certain ways and that they had great, sort of, difficulty with their own propaganda and with the reality. Here was a kid who spoke German the way their own children spoke German, who didn't look as Jewish as they perceived Jews to look from Der Stuirmer, which was the German sort of propaganda newspaper. And suddenly to have this kid talk to them, it personalized it. And I think this was my father's -- he sort of contributed to my doing what I did. He must have said himself, \"You have to.\" Maybe he -- I don't remember, maybe he said, \"You have to tell them you can work.\" It could well be, but it worked. And after that, in Auschwitz again, the first time, when I worked for the Kapo that, the Kapo was somebody my father had known before, because it was a man who had been in the ghetto with us in Kielce and was shipped out of the ghetto to Auschwitz two years before we did. So, by the Thomas Buergenthal 6 November 28, 1995 Page 6 time we came to Auschwitz, he was a Kapo -- quite a brutal one. But he treated his friends well, and he sort of took me in. It was a terrible sort of society, to live. But that helped. I also -- in Kielce still, I worked as an errand boy for the man who ran that work camp, and I must -- I don't know how that came about. But what I remember -- I don't know whether I told it on tape, I probably did -- I used to sit outside his office and he would listen to the radio and I would listen, and would sort of report to my parents on the news because we had no news, of course. So I became the one who tried to memorize all the news that I heard on the German radio, and report it to my father and mother and I suppose through them, to the other people in the camp. I even reported on the fact that Mussolini had been captured and they didn't believe me -- of course they thought this kid is imagining things."

            "num": 9,
            "question": "At that point, a young boy, you might have felt angry or even intense hatred for the Germans. What was it like to work for one, one-on-one as an errand boy, and how did you cope with that?",
            "answer": "You know, I didn't have to cope at all, that's the curious thing. He was a very, he was very nice to me. He never mistreated me. But he was quite brutal. He would beat people if he saw them not working. And so I figured out he would do that and so when he made his inspection tours, I would just really sort of run ahead and make certain motions. He had a hat with a feather and I would motion to people that the feather was coming so everybody started to work, so -- because I had seen him beat Thomas Buergenthal 7 November 28, 1995 Page 7 a lot of people if he caught them not working. But he wasn't, he wasn't, never abused me, never mistreated me. That's strange, you know, as a child I remember he used to have a visit from some officer of the SS who would arrive with a bicycle, and he would hand me the bicycle, to take the bicycle and put it in the bicycle stand. And believe it or not, in all this environment in which we lived, I learned to ride the bike with this SS man's bicycle. You know, a child 1s a child."

            "question": "And you weren't afraid to do that that they might come out of the tent and see you playing with the bike?",
            "answer": "I must say, I thought about it, but then I figured when he told me to take it and as long as I didn't break it, I was all right. You know, the fear factor was not -- the fear factor was one of survival and not of sort of what could happen in between for doing this or doing that. Because I really, when I think back, I was not afraid and not because I'm not a person who's not afraid, but because it just didn't seem there was any reason to be afraid. There were many reasons in the camp to be afraid, but not to these sort of episodes. I was describing to my class -- they asked me the other day -- I remember breaking in with a friend of mine in Auschwitz and in the kitchen of the SS and stealing milk, which was the first milk I had drunk, we had a cup of milk in two years. And if we had been caught we would have been beaten to death, but it sort of: there was the milk and we had to drink it."

            "question": "Were you ever afraid that you yourself would just arbitrarily get beaten, or perhaps Thomas Buergenthal 8 November 28, 1995 Page 8 be chosen to go into the crematorium? After all, you saw this happen often, every day. Did you imagine that happening to you?",
            "answer": "Well, first of all, beaten. You know, one got beaten because one pushed in the food line, and then they swung the stick and I was beaten on my back, but nothing really very serious. No, the fact that one thought, that I thought I would die in there, that was a reality. And it happened quite a number of times, where the risk existed and I knew exactly what was going to happen. As a matter of fact, I was in situations where I thought I was finished, there was no way out. No, that fear, and that fear was tremendous. Until, you know, once I hit a moment when I realized there was nothing more to do, I couldn't escape anymore, and suddenly a tremendous peace came over me, I thought I was going to die. I had done everything possible not to get caught and there was no escape, and I sort of made peace with myself and with death at that point. But it didn't last very long. You know, the survival instinct comes right back."

            "question": "Let's move on now to the point at liberation, and if you can, just situate us. Where were you, how old were you, and what kind of physical state were you 1n?",
            "answer": "I was at liberation, in the concentration camp of Sachsenhausen which is about 20 kilometers outside of Berlin. And by that time I had survived the death march but lost -- I had frostbite, and was operated actually, in an infirmary of Sachsenhausen. They had sort of a hospital set up, because it was one of these model camps, demonstration camps, where they would keep people and could show that they were Thomas Buergenthal 9 November 28, 1995 Page 9 actually treating people well, but at the same time would execute people and do everything else. But it was a model camp, and I was there. I had two toes amputated. And then when the war was coming to a close, the Germans decided to evacuate the camp. But those of us who couldn't really walk very much, and some people were much sicker than I, we were left behind in the hospital. And the assumption was that they were going to come and shoot all of us; this was sort of, we all expected that was going to happen. I was able to move. I had a crutch or a cane or something, so I think I was operated maybe three weeks before, or so. It was strange, after the evacuation of the camp, it was very strange but it was very quiet. And then you begin to hear artillery fire coming closer. And I think I went to sleep, evacuation must have been the day before. The next morning I got up and it was very, very quiet except for the shooting coming closer. I crawled out, went out and looked up and saw in the entrance of the camp, over the entrance on the inside -- they always had a machine gun mounted with SS guards sitting on, and there was nobody there, the machine gun was empty. I came back and told people. Of course, nobody believed that this was happening. And then we just waited and the shooting came closer. Then we began hearing small arms fire and suddenly -- so I think it was in the early afternoon -- we heard the gong, the camp had a big bell in the middle of this field, and a Russian soldier had driven in with a jeep and was ringing the bell saying, \u201cYou're free.\u201d Thomas Buergenthal 10 November 28, 1995 Page 10"

            "num": 13,
            "question": "In what language?",
            "answer": "I don't really know. It must have been in Russian, but Russian and Polish 1s relatively close. And the instructions were that we were free, we could go anyplace we wanted except not this way because that's where the Germans still were, so you go the other way. And the first thing that we did was to storm the place with the SS kept their supplies. And people, of course, these were all people who were quite sick and everybody dragged themselves to the supply place and people began to eat. It was very lucky for me that I couldn't eat. I remember finding a pickle. There was bread and everything else and all I could eat was a pickle. It probably saved my life because a lot of people ate and not having eaten for a long time, just gorged themselves and got quite sick and many of them died. I didn't. I just couldn't swallow. And then sort of a day later, there was a young Pole, must have been in his early 20s and I\u2014we -- decided we were going to leave. So we just went out on the road and started moving, then we were joined by some other people, there were some women, also from -- I don't know where they came, but Polish women. And we -- the houses -- this was the city of where the camp is, Sachsenhausen, 1s Oranienberg, and we must have been in the area of that, moving away from Berlin. The German houses were standing empty because the Germans had fled, and often times the tables were still set, dirty dishes were sitting, and you could just occupy a house and we just moved from one house to the other, until these Polish soldiers Thomas Buergenthal 11 November 28, 1995 Page 11 came and started talking, they talked to the women, of course. And then they saw me and they said, \"Where are you going?\" I said that I didn't know where I was going, I was trying to find my parents. And they said, \"Well where they would be?\" And I said, \"They would probably be in Poland,\" and so they took me with them."

            "question": "Let's go back a couple steps. I'm curious about what else the Russian said, what was that scene, like when the Russian soldier gonged the bell. Did people come out and stand around, then did you guys hug each other? Was there a feeling that you were really liberated at that point, or did that come a little bit later?",
            "answer": "You know when I see pictures of people who are liberated by American troops, by British troops, they were liberated. We were none of these scenes as far as I remember. The Russians just told us, \"You can go.\" There was no effort made to help us in any way, to provide any medical services, and there was no hugging. I don't remember, I mean we felt a great sense of relief because we expected to be shot, but none of that -- 1t was probably too, in retrospect, it was almost too much. It was hard to believe that we were free after all this and that nothing had happened to us. No, I don't remember these scenes of liberation. I really don't remember even realizing that I was liberated until the war was over because everybody started shooting into the air, and it came, sort of, on my birthday. But I didn't have any sense of the tremendous joy that other people must have experienced. I was alone in many ways. I think that if my parents had been there it would have been different.

            "question": "And when you had hooked up with the young Polish boy and you were moving around in the town outside of Sachsenhausen, did you feel frightened that Germans could come up and recapture you, perhaps? What was the mood like, or were you just sitting back with your feet up on the table in these homes and having a nice time?",
            "answer": "Well, where we were afraid, of course, was when we were still in the camp because we didn't know what happened to the Germans, whether they would come back and whether it was really true that they had left. But once we were out, I don't remember worrying about it. It seemed that it was over, and the fact that the Germans had just disappeared without a trace, the soldiers, must have had that impact. But I just don't remember that maybe as a child you're liberated, you're free. No, I had no sense that there was any danger from the Germans at that point. Of course, I then ended up, when I was a mascot, in the battle of Berlin, and that was quite -- there was a really almost hand-to-hand combat and there it was quite dangerous."

            "question": "Tell us about that. First you met some soldiers from the Polish army, tell us about that. How did you meet them and then what happened?",
            "answer": "Well, they came to one of these houses, and I must say, it's hard for me to sort of remember very clearly, how it came about that they took me with them. But they did. They were members of the First Polish Division, the so-called Kosciusko Thomas Buergenthal 13 November 28, 1995 Page 13 Division,\u2019 which had come from Russia. These were people apparently who had been, at least the officers, members of the Polish army in '39 who were then shipped to Siberia. And when the Russians needed troops, they were brought back and given a chance to fight in the Polish army under Russian control. And I, so this was the group and I was in. The soldiers who took me in, they were members of the scout company, so we were sort of the forefront of the division. They took me in. They gave me -- they made me a small uniform and I had shoes. They even gave me a small revolver, another revolver -- a automatic pistol. They had found a circus horse some place, a pony, and -- because much of the army was still horse-drawn. They had supplies of the Russian and Polish army -- was still brought in by horse-drawn carts. There was a lot of horses, and I had my horse and I could keep up with the soldiers, and I had a wonderful time. One of the things I remember doing -- this was a great sort of past time at that point, this shows you how children are children -- shooting at things that I don't know whether people still know what that is -- the electric wires and telegraph on poles are held up, wired around porcelain, white porcelain sort of, what would you call it, cups or -- . The big game was to shoot at those things and shoot them down because, of course -- that was one of the pastimes I engaged in with my Polish soldiers. And also I learned, the one of the people who ' The Taduesz Kosciusko Division, a soldiery comprised of Polish patriots under Russian command, appeared in July 1943. Thomas Buergenthal 14 November 28, 1995 Page 14 took care of me was a shoemaker for the company, another one was a tailor. And I think -- I don't know whether I could still make a pair of shoes, but I actually observed how you make shoes and I helped and I probably at one point could have made a pair of shoes from scratch."

            "answer": "It's -- when you think about it, it reads like, sounds like, a novel from Garcia Marquez,\u201d but it's true. And it, the strange thing is that the sort of, the absurdity of it, the comic aspect of it never occurred to me as a child. Its -- you know, at the same time, all of this I thought was going to lead to my being reunited with my parents, and I never even thought that this wasn't going to happen, this was all part of a process. In the meantime I could eat and I no longer had to be afraid and I had fun. I had a horse. Actually, on the food, I should tell you that I, since I had no appetite and the Poles were quite concerned that I couldn't eat, they started giving me, at first, a half a spoon of vodka, then a spoon of vodka, and that stimulated my appetite at the point where I could really keep up with them to drinking vodka because it was my medicine. That was sort of the only lingering thing that had survived from the camp. Well, of course, I had -- -my amputation was still\u2014I had to change bandages. I did Thomas Buergenthal 15 November 28, 1995 Page 15 all of that myself. I don\u2019t even remember ever being taken to a doctor when I was liberated."

One day you don't have anything to eat and the next day there's suddenly food.

There were certain foods that, you know, bread of course, to this day good bread is something that I -- I always use the example that when I hear the word bread in German or Polish, I can smell it. It has sort of an emotion attached to it, whereas the English word for bread is a word that I learned, it's an Thomas Buergenthal 17 November 28, 1995 Page 17 intellectual, is an intellectual concept, but it doesn't have all the emotion tied up with the words chleb,* or the word Brot* in German, which was all of the things that I was deprived of and that I needed the most. The one thing that I thought I would never eat again would be turnips because we used to get turnip soup in Auschwitz, with a little piece of bread which was often the only meal we had.

I eat hardly any bread except for when I'm in Europe where my discipline goes. And they know that. Actually bread and sausages, which, of course, I can't eat because I had a bypass a few years ago.

We came into Berlin while the battle for Berlin was still raging and we were camped in the park near where the rocket artillery that the Russians had. We're shooting over at the Germans and the Germans were shooting back. And I slept in an armored car because there was still fighting going on, and as we drove into Berlin, you could see there were Russian soldiers, dead soldiers on one side, Germans on the other. The battle was still raging for about two days. But then of course, the Germans surrendered and we actually took German prisoners at the end of the -- when Berlin fell. But during the battle, you know, people got killed. That was a danger that somebody could get killed. Actually some people from our company who had Thomas Buergenthal 19 November 28, 1995 Page 19 ventured out on the street in the truck, the hand grenade was thrown -- because the Germans were still occupying the houses -- but nothing happened to me. I didn't participate in any of the fighting, I didn't shoot either. But we were counting because these rocket-propelled grenades that the Russians had, the Kosciusko would shoot out, sort of, six or 12 at the same time, and they were supposed to be moving because you can very easily locate them. And we were concerned. I remember the Polish saying that they really should be moving because the Germans could find where they were and then start bombarding us and them. But the Germans, at that point, German artillery was no longer very effective and nothing happened."

I don't remember, first of all, I don't remember any of the Poles attacking Thomas Buergenthal 20 November 28, 1995 Page 20 any of the German prisoners, and I don't remember having that feeling. I remember having that feeling very much when I came back and I was reunited with my mother in Germany and seeing -- we had a balcony in that town, my mother's home town in Germany, in Gottingen -- and sitting on the balcony on a Sunday and seeing the German families taking a walk and my father hadn't come back. And at that point, you know, the desire of sort of seeing -- when I first came back I would love to mount the machine gun on that balcony and shoot all of them. But if I think back in Berlin of the German prisoners we took, I didn't have that feeling for some strange reason. It may have been too distant or... I remember there were negotiations going on for the surrender of the Germans, and at one point it looked there was some danger because there was a whole forest full of Germans as we were moving back and our company was quite exposed but the Germans wanted to surrender. And these negotiations went on all night and I slept through the whole thing and when I woke up in the morning, most of the German officers had merely negotiated in order to be able to escape. That's also I remember from that episode."

And so I sort of structured my own story that I came from Kielce, which was the ghetto where we had been, and that I expected to find my parents back in Kielce. That was sort of the extent of that conversation, but I must say, I don't remember very much of that period. It's strange; I have memories, sort of episodic memory, but not chronological memory.

Religion and Judaism became part of survival for me and I think that was part of what my father, my family brought me up. The Germans wanted to kill us because we were Jews and we were going to win this battle with them as Jews and we were going to survive. And so the Judaism that Thomas Buergenthal 22 November 28, 1995 Page 22 was instilled in me was the Judaism that said that we were going to win over the Germans, we're not going to let them kill us and we were going to be proud of the fact that we can survive. I remember my father always saying, \"We are going to be alive long after they are six feet under.\" So in that sense, Judaism, the fact that we were different, was part of the thing that helped us live. That was very strongly instilled in me. But never religious, never from a religious point of view. But my father was very much, very strong as a believer the fact that he was a Jew, but not a religious Jew at all, neither was my mother."

But one of the Jewish soldiers from that company, who knew that I was Jewish and with whom I spoke, then takes me to a Jewish orphanage in Otwock, near Warsaw, which shows you that I hid my Judaism one way but as far as the Jewish soldier and I were concerned, I knew that I was Jewish and he knew that I was Jewish.

I must have because I had nothing else, so I must have arrived that way. I don't really remember the arrival part but I do remember that I was sort of -- and that made it easier. I was the only one there who had been in the camps. All the other kids had been hidden some place or had come from Russia or some place. So I was sort of an oddity and there was a lot of people asking questions, how was this. And the treatment was wonderful. I was still very thin and underweight and the cook in this place always made sure I would get a whole cupful or a soup bowl of cream so that I could gain Thomas Buergenthal 24 November 28, 1995 Page 24 some weight. I don't think that was such a good idea in retrospect. And eggs, you know, all of the things that I don't remember having. And of course the orphanage was interesting because the orphanage was divided into sort of two types of kids. And, there were the real orphans, and I was considered one of the real orphans, without a mother and a father, and we were the tough kids. Then there were what we considered the weaklings because they had one parent but for some reason they were there. And, I was the youngest of that group and was treated extremely well, had a lot of fun, played games. And again, sort of, unthinking about what the future was going to hold and always believing without really doubting it, questioning it, that sooner or later I would find my parents."

They wanted to kill us and we made it; we didn't give them the joy of killing us. So there was a tremendous sense of satisfaction, that of survival, unlike what one reads now that people supposedly feel bad that they survived and others didn't. We never Thomas Buergenthal 25 November 28, 1995 Page 25 had that feeling and neither did my mother because my mother survived. I mean we felt very bad that, for example, my father didn't survive. He died just shortly before the end of the war. But we never felt that guilty about the fact of surviving, on the contrary. We were, it was a sense of satisfaction that we had survived.

It -- the transition wasn't difficult at all. It was an easy transition. It would have been much harder the other way Thomas Buergenthal 26 November 28, 1995 Page 26 around. That is, I think, an important thing. That I, if you were my age, the post survival period and the adjustment and the survival period was all much easier because in the camp I never thought like other people must have, my parents, how wonderful it was to eat a good meal or anything of that sort. And missing all of the conveniences that one had, I couldn't take it today. I've often thought that I couldn't survive today.

But not because they wanted to comfort me or anything, it was just somebody -- if they wanted to talk about the orphanage, this was an example.

But again as part of the self-defense mechanism, you tried not to think about it, you tried not to see it. Although, you know, it's strange, I can talk about my experience in the camp, I can write about it. I can't see movies about it. I can't read. A lot of things they affect me tremendously, increasingly so. And I think in part because I must have sort of suppressed a lot of things that come out now. But I'm struck by the fact how much more, how difficult certain things are for me today than they were even 20 years ago. I, when I just even see a snippet of a movie, say Schindler's List, they would show something on television, I would break down. Despite the fact that I give the impression that nothing phases me, that I just simply can't take.

And she would record, she would ask me questions and I would tell her about things. As we were driving into Kielce, I suddenly remembered the address of the house and the street where we were in the ghetto. I hadn't remembered it for Thomas Buergenthal 31 November 28, 1995 Page 31 years, I couldn't remember it. It suddenly came back to me. And we drove into Kielce, and I sort of directed her, and I'm a person who gets lost any place. I get lost in Washington, DC, if I don't see the Washington monument and here I sort of directed her within two blocks of where we were in the ghetto and found the house. The interesting thing is -- you know how children are -- I kept telling her, \"It's this big house, I don't know, it must be six or seven stories high.\" When we got to it, it was a three-story building. It was just as dilapidated, just as terrible as it was when I remembered it. And the faces of the people, there was a tremendous amount of antisemitism in Poland, and in Kielce particularly it was quite bad. We were always afraid that if you tried to escape from the camp you would be handed over to the Germans. The faces of the people and the lack of the fact that there was no monument any place in the ghetto to say this was the ghetto. All I could think about was, I want to get out of here. I just couldn't take it. Thinking that my parents lived in this one room in this house. My mother had just died and I couldn't wait to leave. It was lunchtime and we were going to stop and have lunch, I said, \"I don't want to do anything, I just want to get out of this place.\" I'd spent four years of my life there. But it was exactly, I mean the part of the ghetto, that whole area -- and the lack of any remembering, any effort made to remember that 20,000 people had lived here who had died. I did go -- we did go to a museum. We tried to find a museum and I asked for a book on the Jewish community of Kielce; eventually they found Thomas Buergenthal 32 November 28, 1995 Page 32 something that had been issued, there had been some exhibit I don't know how long ago, but there was nothing in the museum that you could see. This was the city museum of Kielce, and there was nothing about the wartime experience. A book that I eventually got -- it's sort of small little book about the Jewish community which must have been issued during the Communist period. It was shocking to me, well, first the way that nothing had changed, but then it was sort of totally, it's as if all of this that had happened there had no impact on the people and they didn't even want to remember it, whereas it was quite different in Auschwitz. In Auschwitz, I had come in, we went first. I was in Birkenau in the nice camp in Auschwitz, so we went in there first. And I was very concerned how it would go. As we walked in we saw a sign that said, \u201cARCHIVES,\u201d and my wife said, \"Why don't you go in and introduce yourself?\" I was at this point thinking I should be writing down my experiences. And I said, \"No, I want to be a tourist, I don't want to bother with any of that.\" And she insisted, so she usually prevails. I went in, introduced myself, and they took me to the director and he then introduced me to the archivist, and they were a whole group of people who came in. They were at that point actually working on a study on children in the camp. So they wanted to know, where were you and everything else. And then I had them check my number and find out when I arrived, and they had all of the -- they had the document, they knew the number of people that came with my transport to Auschwitz.

Matter of fact, my mother walked back -- she was liberated not far from Regensburg -- she walked back to Poland, to Kielce, looking for me. There were people who had -- because she and my father had sort of different weigh stations where they were going to meet after the war. And people there had been in the camp with me and some people had seen me at this point or at that point. They all told her, \"He can't be alive, forget it,\" you know. She insisted. Well, my uncle, who lived here in the United States -- my mother then went back to her hometown in Germany, was very sick. She was sort of three months drugged just to sleep it all off, and got in touch with my uncle and they started the search and so the Jewish agency for Palestine and Thomas Buergenthal 34 November 28, 1995 Page 34 various search bureaus of Red Cross and other things. In the meantime, I was in the orphanage and in the orphanage -- the orphanage was run by Jewish Communists, so-called the Bund party, who wanted Jews to stay in Poland and become good Communists. But the orphanage had been infiltrated by a Zionist organization and one of our counselors was a young woman, a Zionist woman from the Ha-Shomer Ha-Za\u2019ir movement, which is a Zionist labor movement. And they decided that those of us who wanted to go to Palestine then -- this was in 1946 -- we should run away from the orphanage and we would be picked up by the people from that group and then taken to a kibbutz in Poland and then eventually be shipped illegally to Palestine. And so, the procedure was that every week or so, one kid who wanted to go there would run away from the orphanage and would disappear. But we all who wanted to go, put our names, tell them that we wanted to run away, so they made a list with our names. But I was told that since I had been on newsreels, that if I ran away that would really draw attention to the whole thing, so I had to be the last one to run away. But the list with names was sent to Palestine and it was sent to the Jewish agency in Palestine and somebody in the Jewish agency looked at those lists - this 1s pre-computers, imagine -- 1t was written in heaven -- saw a mother looking for her child and a child with the same name on another list. Notified my uncle in the United States, and then my mother and then eventually they -- an American organization smuggled me out of Poland and Czechoslovakia to the American zone Thomas Buergenthal 35 November 28, 1995 Page 35 in Germany and then to the British zone in Germany where my mother was. That was in December of 1946, so imagine, I was separated from my mother in 1944."

            "answer": "Well, nothing was easy after the war. I had no papers for one thing, no passports -- you would have had to have visas and everything else. The orphanage was very cooperative and the orphanage was also supported by Jewish organizations from the outside, particularly the American Joint Distribution Committee. So they, sort of through my uncle, started beginning to move this reunion and how to get me to Germany. What happened was that somebody came and said that they were going to take me to my mother and the orphanage agreed. I suppose they investigated it, and I went with them. We had to be smuggled out of Poland, this was in the winter, this was end of November, December 1946. We crossed over the border into Czechoslovakia, it was freezing and I was very affected because of my frostbite. We had to walk across the Czech/Polish border, they had bribed the guards, it wasn't dangerous but it was still a sort of, 1t was an illegal operation. I then ended up, I was picked up by an American woman working for one of these organizations in Prague, Thomas Buergenthal 37 November 28, 1995 Page 37 taken to a hotel. I had never been in -- what I remember from this, it's funny how these things stay in your mind. It was a revolving door and I didn't know how to get into it. I was just standing there worrying. She walked through the revolving door and I was supposed to follow her and here I stood, I didn't know how to -- after all this, the revolving door was something I had never seen before. Well, we stayed in Prague for a few days and then again we took a train but we got out of the train -- there was another group of border smugglers from a Jewish organization called Brichah which took us from the Czech side to a German town called Hirth in Bavaria; it was the American zone. Again, trudging through border, walking across with bribed border guards, and ending up in Munich and eventually going on a military train with her from Munich to Gottingen, crossing into the British zone of Germany, and my mother awaiting me -- not in Gottingen, she couldn't wait -- in another town. Well -- and then you know, then I just couldn't believe it at that point, that's when the realization set in."

            "answer": "I don't know whether that's true. I reverted to being her little boy in many ways. But it's interesting because I spent -- we had to think of school and all of this -- and I had a year, a little more than a year of private tutoring from a retired German teacher, and he said that he couldn't get over the fact that I would be a little child in one sense and a grown man in another when we discussed things and I imagine that was the same with my mother. Although, with my mother, we discussed -- there was a lot of reminiscing about the camp, you know -- where was this, what happened. But I was a child, I played, I did everything. I wasn't at that point -- this was in 1946, 1947 -- how old was I? 14, 13 years old. I couldn't speak German too well. Again, this was sort of the interesting part; it took me a while to get back into German because I had Thomas Buergenthal 39 November 28, 1995 Page 39 spoken much more Polish than German, and it took me sort of a month or two to be fluent again in German even though at home we used to speak German and Polish.

And things would come back and you would talk about this or that and another thing that is so interesting, people often think that when people get together from a camp, all we'd talk about were all these terrible things that happened. The truth of the matter is that we often laughed about things in retrospect, about things that happened that were funny, about this or that happened. So the human spirit -- you couldn't take all this if 1t were only reminiscences about all the terrible things. So my wife often sort of marveled about the fact that even in recent years when my mother and I would get together we would talk about these things and talk about them often and remember this funny thing, and remember this. It wasn't only remembering the terrible things that had happened. I imagine it was probably when I was little we talked more about those things."

It was a loss, you know, we lost so many people. It was a terrible thing that my father hadn't survived.

It was a reality one simply accepted, added to all the other things that had happened. But one didn't mourn the way we do in ordinary, everyday life. That simply didn't happen. I'm sure when my mother first found out, it must have been extremely difficult. But by the time I was reunited with my mother I think I -- I don't know when or if ever, on the one hand I always believed I was going to find my parents, but at the same time I must have at some point in the orphanage already concluded that I wouldn't be reunited, that neither of them lived."

            "answer": "No, you know. I think I assumed that my life had been normal from the very beginning. The fact that 1t wasn't normal was part of it being normal, this was all part of the life that I had lived. I mean you would think that going back to Germany for example, would be difficult. It was difficult. It was very difficult initially for my Thomas Buergenthal 42 November 28, 1995 Page 42 mother but this was the only place she really could go back to. My mother always told the story with a very bad conscious, very guilty, because she was standing on the street corner in her home town and an old lady came up to her and asked her to help her across the street and my mother said, \"Nobody helped my mother across the street in this town.\" This was right after she came back. Then for years she would talk about 1t and say how terrible it was that she had acted that way. So you know, we had all of those feelings. But then I went there to school initially but at first the thought to go with these kids whose fathers had killed my father. But then you realize that these are people you don't know whether they killed your father, most of them probably didn't, and you make friends. And you find for example, we lived in the house with somebody, who was, a Catholic family that had actually helped the Jews in town, had been in danger themselves. And so that sort of abstract hatred becomes transformed into the fact that they're human beings regardless of whether they're Germans or not Germans and not every German was guilty."

But in one class, I don't know whether it was even a history class, but the issue came up of the bombing of Dresden and Hamburg and the teacher was saying how terrible that was and I raised my hand and I said, \"Well, if you're going to talk about that, why don't you also talk about all the other terrible things that you people did,\" and all hell broke loose. The teacher got very huffy initially and then, of course, worried because this was right after the war and they had to go through denazification and all of these things. Then he came at some point to our house and apologized. But that was the only incident which this matter ever came up. Of course, they tried to never talk about it.

You know the strange thing is that when you enter a class, I learned very early because I learned it in the orphanage, too; in the orphanage, I was the kid who was sent to get the mail from the post office, this was in Poland. Because a lot of kids, the Poles would throw stones at and attack them and yell antisemitic slogans at them. I would go and pick up the mail and nobody would yell at me. For one thing I didn't look Jewish. But I remember once confronting somebody and who said something about me and the first reaction was to just slug him, and I learned very early that with all of that, the best way was to just be extremely aggressive and if somebody said something like this, you just whopped them one but you didn't act as if you were afraid. And that was also very effective in school in Germany when you enter the class. I was quite strong. And so you took on, not because of antisemitism or anything else, but when you came into a new environment you had to assert yourself and so you took on the fellow who was supposed to be the strongest.

But that's the only thing that I remember of that period. But I should tell you a story that is interesting connected with occupation forces because we mentioned Mr. Nansen who had written a diary, then a book about me. I forgot his name when I was liberated from the camp. I couldn't remember his name. But when I came back to my mother I kept saying, \"There was this wonderful man, this Norwegian who had saved my life and was very nice to me, and his father was very famous and his father's pictures were on even the packages of cookies that he once gave me.\" And my mother said, \"He must have been some famous cookie manufacturer.\" So you know, it was just sort of the way you would treat a kid. I kept saying, \"No, no, this man...\" Then, one day in 1948, my mother was reading a newspaper that was for \u00b0 Janner, Barnett, Lord (1892-), British communal and Zionist leader. \u2019 Speer, Albert (1905-1981); Reich Minister for Armaments and War Production, Thomas Buergenthal 50 November 28, 1995 Page 50 former inmates in the camp and there was a little write-up of a book that had just been published, the diaries of a man, a Norwegian, who had been in Sachsenhausen so my mother said to me \"That might be your cookie -- he might know who that man was. Why don't we write to him and find out?\" So we wrote this letter to him asking whether he might know the man who was so nice to me. And of course the mail was terrible in those days. Nothing happened for a while. Then one day the doorbell rings and there's a big Norwegian military truck outside and the girl who opened the door said, \"Yes?\" He said, \"Well, we have a package here for the Buergenthal family. So she said, \"Give it to me,\" and they said, \"No, no, no, it's much too heavy, we have to take it in.\" So they take a tremendous crate and they bring it up and it's food collected from Norwegian children with a letter from him saying that he's the person and, you know, how delighted he was that I'm alive because he thought that I had died in the camp and as a result that's why the book was dedicated to me, among others, because he thought that I hadn't survived. Then eventually he came and he actually took me to Norway to spend six weeks in Norway, and had a wonderful time. But it was, when he learned that I was alive, he announced it in Norway and so the school children began to collect food. And apparently they collected, there was a lot of chocolate which was rationed at that time in Norway, so it was quite a sacrifice for Norwegian children to give up their chocolate rations so I could have that. The Hitler\u2019s chief architect. Thomas Buergenthal 51 November 28, 1995 Page 51 Scandinavians were just wonderful in the camp."

It was a long trip, I think we were at least a week if not longer on the ship, with a large number of refugees; it was immigrants coming. All nationalities, all languages. Well, what can I tell you about it? It was actually quite an interesting trip because I realized again the survival instinct that we talked about. People had to work on the boats, people had to paint and sweep. At that point I was 17 and I realized that wasn't really the nice thing to have to do and I volunteered to be an interpreter, so I would have to go and make the announcements in different languages over the Thomas Buergenthal 53 November 28, 1995 Page 53 public address system. In that capacity we had a lovely place to stay and we actually published a newspaper. I still have the newspaper that we published on the last day on the arrival in New York. It was a very wonderful group of people from all over including a Kalnick (ph) family from the steppes of Russia. I still have some pictures. Then I came to the United States. For some reason my uncle couldn't pick me up, he wasn't allowed to pick me up from the ship but I was picked up by a Jewish welfare service organization who took me to a house, like a sort of halfway house in the Bronx where I stayed a week before my uncle picked me up. The very funny thing that happened there, I arrived there and there were other kids in this house and they of course were natives already, they'd been here a few weeks and knew New York and everything. They took me, they said, \"You want to see New York? You want to see Manhattan?\" Of course I wanted to see Manhattan. We got on the subway and the doors opened up and they got out at one stop and I didn't make it out and I had no idea where I was because I had no address, but we got reunited at the next stop. But my uncle and my aunt are wonderful people, they're still alive. My uncle and aunt came, their names are Sylberg, Eric and Senta Sylburg (ph). They lived in Paterson, New Jersey, at the time. They came in 1938 to the United States, a very hard time. They worked in factories, one daughter. They're now in their 80s but still doing very well. And they took me in. They weren't wealthy people at all. And I lived with them for a year and a half while I went to Thomas Buergenthal 54 November 28, 1995 Page 54 high school in Paterson. They were sort of my surrogate parents for many years, until I went to Bethany."

It was usually you got electives only in the third year so I had my first international law course in my third year of law school. It wasn't until I went onto graduate law that I specialized and could specialize in international law.

And literature -- I actually majored -- I minored in English in college of all things. Then in law school I wanted to study international things but I really had only one course as I mentioned before, then I decided to go on to graduate school. I did my law school at NYU and I went on to Harvard for a masters and eventually for a doctorate in international law. What was interesting, struck me, I reread my application to Harvard what I wanted to do, and in my application I said that I wanted to study international courts among other things, and then I ended up serving 12 years on an international court without knowing it. It was sort of a strange thing, but that's what I wanted to do. But I did work at Harvard on international organizations I was particularly interested in. The European common market was just beginning and I was interested in how that court functioned. Then I did my doctorate actually on a subject that everybody is surprised out, I did it on international air law.

What were your reactions to it? What did you like about it, what did you dislike about it?",
            "answer": "Well, if we're just talking law school in general, I disliked almost everything about it. I just hated my first year in law school. I thought it was much too technical and very lacking in -- at least the way it was taught in those days -- very little policy orientation and there was sort of various technical, dry case analysis that didn't, to my mind at the time, didn't focus on what I thought were important issues. It wasn't really until I was able to study what I was really interested in, which was international law. I got interested, I began to enjoy law really in my third year in law school, and then international law because I saw it as an instrument of being able to deal with some of the problems that I had myself experienced. And I wanted to see to what extent law could play a role in preventing some of these things. And I'm not saying this in any sort of philosophical sense, but I thought I had a background in, a language background and was sort of naturally drawn to things international. I therefore thought it would be interesting to see to what extent various organizations like the UN, the European Common Market, the Council of Europe; to what extent they're doing something that in fact might prevent the reoccurrence of the things that I had experienced. And once I got into it, that was the thing that really captivated me."

            "answer": "Well, it depends a little bit where -- when I got to Harvard I had some wonderful professors of international law, probably among the best in the world. And they demonstrated the importance of it and sort of opened a completely new different world for me. But of course, all the people around us, that is to say not in the law school but the world around us believed that all of this really didn't exist, that there was no such thing as international law and that it was totally irrelevant. And so you always had the sense that you were sort of an academic who was studying something that had no relevance to anything that happened in the real world. I never believed this, I always thought that 1t was much more relevant than people thought, than the average person thought, and much more relevant than most Americans thought. I thought Americans probably had a much less of an understanding of the importance of international law than people in other parts of the world. And less of a realization of the importance of the UN for example and the significance of it than people in other parts of the world. So it was sort of almost a schizophrenic aspect when you were studying international law. You'd go to a cocktail party and people would say, \"Well, what are you studying?\" You'd say, \"International law,\" and they'd say, \"Does it really exist?\" Then when I started teaching, you'd get the same, sort of. But what I was able to do and throughout my life, my professional life, is that I never Thomas Buergenthal 60 November 28, 1995 Page 60 just did, I was never just an academic, that I wrote and taught international law, particularly human rights and international organizations. But starting in the early 70s I really worked -- in the 70s I began to represent the U.S. Government at UNESCO in human rights matters, then I ended up on the InterAmerican Court of Human Rights where we dealt with some very nasty cases like disappearances and other things. And now I'm on the UN Human Rights Committee, and we're doing the same. I was on the Truth Commission of El Salvador, all the time while continuing to teach. So that, to me, international law was never just an academic subject. I also - | have lived it almost all of the years since I began teaching. I've also practiced it in a way, not in as a law firm lawyer but as a international lawyer working in the field."

            "question": "When would you say you began to develop a philosophy of human rights law and that you saw that emerge in your ideals in the kinds of choices you were making and the cases you were bringing? And what is your philosophy, I suppose?",
            "answer": "Well you know, I've never brought a human rights case. I've always thought that I could be much more effective in the human rights area by not being an activist in the sense of being a lawyer filing cases, but an academic who could be perceived to have a legitimacy when he spoke on human rights issue that wasn't driven by political considerations. It wasn't driven by other considerations and that had no political agenda other than concern for human rights. And that has been enabled me, * United Nations Educational and Cultural Organizations Thomas Buergenthal 61 November 28, 1995 Page 61 in fact, to be on a human rights court and be put in positions of being able, I think, to do a great deal in the human rights area, and to be taken seriously in the human rights area without being viewed as somebody who has a political agenda. I think it's very important for NGOs\u2019 and activist organizations to do the work that they're doing, but it's also important for people to be seen as committed to human rights and committed to the advancement of human rights who aren't political activists in the field. And I've always thought that I could do much more by doing that, by staying above the sort of political foray, and that was particularly important in Latin America, where from the beginning if you spoke about human rights you were perceived to be a Communist. As a matter of fact, I founded the InterAmerican Institute of Human Rights in Costa Rica, precisely in order to legitimate just a discussion of human rights, which when I first came I was involved with Latin America in the late 70s, the discussion of human rights wasn't a legitimate subject, it just became aggressive political discourse between the right and the left. And so my sense has always been that some of us, at any rate, can contribute much more through teaching and through serving as impartial arbiters in this field. In the teaching area, I -- my former professor at Harvard and I -- did the first American case book in international human rights. We established the teaching of international human rights in the American law schools. And our book came out in 1977 and ? National Governing Organizations Thomas Buergenthal 62 November 28, 1995 Page 62 before then only three of us taught the subject. It's now taught in almost all American law schools. And, you know, I have a little book for students on the teaching of -- on international human rights, which actually the subject has suddenly taken on a life of it's own not only in law schools but every place else, which it didn't have when I first started in this field in the late 60s. Nobody was interested in this field and in the international -- the American Society of International -- didn't even consider human rights to be a subject of international -- so I worked in both of these areas and I thought it was always very important. Philosophy -- that's the philosophy I suppose. To my mind the most important thing in this field is not to let yourself be politicized; that's the biggest danger that I see. People who promote human rights, when they politicize the subject, do a great deal of harm to the victims because they then debilitate themselves in being able to protect victims. Also I've learned a great deal of patience in this field. It takes a few lifetimes to be able to achieve anything. But, you know, the most gratifying thing is to -- it's often occurred to me when I worked in Zepuan (ph) sitting on the case or when investigating human rights violations in El Salvador or now at the UN -- to think that somebody who had survived Auschwitz is given the opportunity to be working in this field now. It's a wonderful -- it's a gift, it's a blessing when you think about it, you know, that I've been given this opportunity. It's exciting and that's what sort of makes this all for me. Every time I sit on something that sort of brings back the memory, it seems to me to Thomas Buergenthal 63 November 28, 1995 Page 63 say that it's almost as if there was something written that I'm supposed to be doing this. The irony, the poetic justice of my doing this, comes back so often. It came back particularly in El Salvador where so many things that I saw reminded me of the camps, from the massacres to the executions. But to think, you know, to think of the cold Polish winters and the tropics of El Salvador, yet the same cruelty, and for me to be able to be involved in this, it boggles the mind in many ways."

What it does, it's you have a much better sense of the reality in which an event happened. It's as if, you know, if I were a judge sitting on a commercial case and I'd been prior to that a lawyer practicing in the commercial law area, I would have a much better sense of dealing with this material than somebody who came out of some other environment. Well, it's a little the same for me when I deal with a human rights case. This is a reality. When I hear somebody describe a certain situation, there is an understanding of what could have happened and also doubts raise when somebody tells you something, you say whenever that doesn't sound right. And you can make those, you can have those doubts only if you've lived through something similar. So to that extent there is a connection, and to that extent it's very useful. But it shouldn't affect your decision- making process. But of course, there is the empathy that comes out of the experience, is there. And I think people shouldn't be in human rights if they don't have some empathy for what it is to be subjected to violations.

But at the time really when they were young they had no interest whatsoever, at least none that I could perceive. But now they really are very interested and they want to know this and that.

I've often thought that it would be wonderful if one of these people would actually call me a liar so one could maybe bring a libel suit to try to establish the truth of what actually happened. No, I've never had it. For many years I thought it wasn't worthwhile taking these people serious and I thought, you know, just a bunch of kooks. But it's surprising how some of these people have gained a certain legitimacy and that's why it's important to deal with it. Because, of course, behind this Holocaust denial, it's not so much that they are denying it just for it's own sake but I think they're denying it in order to reestablish the type of political organizations that made this thing possible in the first place. So it's part of the Neofascist, Neonazi- type movement, and if you can deny that, that 1t happened, then it strengthens your political movement and that's dangerous."

As a matter of fact, it was -- I think I'm one of the few people who became an American citizen with the help of the FBI because I had won the nomination for the Rhodes scholarship from West Virginia from Bethany and then from the state of West Virginia, and I wasn't a citizen yet and in order to compete in the finals I had to be a citizen. A lawyer in West Virginia who had been an FBI agent and who was also a former Rhodes scholar moved all kinds Thomas Buergenthal 69 November 28, 1995 Page 69 of things to get me my citizenship, get me cleared very fast so that I could get it. I had been in the country long enough but it would have taken much longer. But I managed to get it and I managed not to get the Rhodes scholarship because I couldn't explain in the finals why I wanted to go to England when I had just gotten to the United States, which was very difficult to explain, and I really was lost."

            "answer": "Well, I really think that the reaction to the Nazi rallies here have been wrong ones. I think that one should let the people march, one should do what the Norwegians did when I was in Oslo. At one point, when they had a Nazi demonstration, the people all came out led by the bishop of Oslo and when the marchers walked by, all of the people in the street turned their backs to them in silent demonstration, which to me is the way they should be handled. If you start fights and everything, that's exactly what they want. And first of all, I think in this country we have enough other mechanisms to deal with it that we don't need to prohibit those marches. Let them, Thomas Buergenthal 70 November 28, 1995 Page 70 but deal with them with dignity and not pay any attention to them."

It's probably more important for him to learn Russian because he's responsible for issues relating to the rule of law all over the former Soviet Thomas Buergenthal 71 November 28, 1995 Page 71 Republics and eastern Europe.

            "question": "Go back to when your sons were little, when they were about five or six or seven, maybe eight. What were your thoughts? Would you look at them, they were little boys like you were, did it surprise you the things they did, did it make you think about what you were like, and how much -- probably they were too young then but as they got older, how much did you tell them about what had happened to you, and have you told them everything? Or does a person who's heard the Holocaust Museum video tape, do they perhaps know a few more details about what you experienced in the camps than they do, at this point?",
            "answer": "I think if you saw the Holocaust video tape, they might know more than my children. Although my children might know a lot of other details that they wouldn't know. Did I tell them? I suppose on different occasions, different little snippets, 'l Agency for International Development Thomas Buergenthal 72 November 28, 1995 Page 72 particularly when my mother used to come and visit we would reminisce. But probably not as much either as I could have or as I should have but at the same time you really as a parent, you know, you can't just try to drum things into kids\u2019 heads and if they don't want to ask, there's nothing much to tell. I think their interest is gradual, has really come more recent. But maybe, you know, I never know, because it may well be that they were afraid to ask, that they thought it would be painful, although it never has been because in our family we always talked about these things. But maybe they didn't want to ask for a variety of reasons. They certainly, I don't think, can really imagine what it was and they never really asked that kind of thing. There was something else you asked me that I've forgotten, the first part. It will come back."

Well, you know, every so often when children were sort of my age, I would look at them and I would think, could they survive this? You know, this is the age and look, they are such children and this was the age that I was when this happened. Then you somehow think, yes, they could have. When you see street children in Latin America, how street-smart they are and how they survive, you realize kids have that in them. I've seen this in Brazil, I've seen it in other places, in Guatemala. These kids have that survival instinct. But when you look at sort of, our Thomas Buergenthal 73 November 28, 1995 Page 73 children you say, \u201cNo, they could never make it.\u201d But the fact is they could. There's tremendous resilience that children have, some children. Some children may be more sensitive than others but I think children are blessed with this resilience that enables them to survive better than grown-ups can survive in many situations."

            "question": "Obviously you lost your childhood in many ways. Is it something you got back later on? An example would be, when you're that young you still want to be held a lot. Did anybody ever hold you when you were a little boy in the camps or is that something you just lost?",
            "answer": "No, nobody held me except my mother and father. But it's interesting, when I came back when I found my mother, I think the first year I just stuck to her as if, you know, I kissed her all the time. It was sort of all coming back. But of course I missed a lot. At the same time, you know, it's sort of curious but I think -- I did eight years of school in one year of private tutoring and it turns out I have dyslexia which I never realized I had. One of my children has that problem and he suffered quite a lot because it appeared in first grade and second grade; it was a problem. I didn't know I had it until he was tested and the doctor tested me and it turned out that my case was just as serious as his but because I started so much later, I just learned how to compensate for it. So there are a lot of things that, there were also benefits. Just to think of all the eight years of school one could have skipped without supposedly any great loss of learning. Although I have always kidded by the fact that I never really Thomas Buergenthal 14 November 28, 1995 Page 74 learned the alphabet properly.
