And one of the interesting aspects that I will talk more about later is that when we left Germany and went to England, the circumstances were very bad financially as far as my parents were concerned. And he, in 1948, went back to Germany because he wanted to help build up the country again. And so he went back. The bank asked him to come back and he worked there until he retired and was very happy. My mother was not as happy about it. So and that\u2019s a very unusual thing. My sister and I swore we would never go back there."

And I had another sister called Ruth who was two years younger than my older sister and two years older than I was. She died at a very young age when she was four in Berlin. Of I think septicemia which there was no drugs for that or anything. So I never, I don\u2019t remember her very well. Really what I know about her is more from what my sister has told me. And my sister lives in Scotland and has children and grandchildren there so she comes and visits me occasionally and I go and visit her."

But one of the things I want to do is go and visit Berlin next year. My husband never wanted to go. So I haven\u2019t been back since and for a long time I didn\u2019t particularly want to go either.

            "question": "Let\u2019s talk about the religious life of your family. How would you explain that?",
            "answer": "Well this is very strange because both my families, both my parents\u2019 families were Jewish and in both cases they knew each other for a long time. There was quite a sizeable Jewish community in Breslau when they were growing up. And they were quite close to their cousins and so they\u2019re not related directly. But their parents who were both lawyers, their fathers who were both lawyers, decided that they, they themselves. No, that\u2019s wrong. That they would bring up their children as Christians, because they wanted them to have the opportunities that everybody else had. And they themselves had, they felt really suffered because they were very bright smart people. They could never rise in the legal profession beyond a certain level. They could never be judges. And they felt that that really hampered them. So, so both my parents grew up as Christians. And in both cases no cousins did but they did and in fact \u2014"

            "answer": "Well none of the other related families that were in Breslau became Christian, that I know of. And so we were raised as Christians also. I had one aunt who became very attached to the church and in fact was in Berlin and worked with Niemdller and did some wonderful things in getting people out of Berlin. She herself didn\u2019t get out til I think it was 1941."

I\u2019m not sure that they went to church that very much at that point. But they did you know they brought us up that way. They heard our prayers and then when we went to bed and so on.

I mean she first, she became very active in the student Christian movement when she was in college. And I did also when I was at university.

And you know we sort of peaked at what was going on at the parties sometimes. We had some close relatives who played a large part in the future of our family. The name was Pariser, P-A-R-I-S-E-R. My cousin and Hannah Pariser were, sorry, my father and Hannah Pariser were first cousins. They This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Sort of funny that I married Milkman. And so they kept in touch with them a lot. They lived in another part of Berlin. And Franz Pariser was a, I think he was the president of the textile organization, whatever it was. And they had a textile factory. So Ill talk about him later also. Other things that I remember, I remember we had a garden. I remember that I was very active, much more so than my older sister. And liked to do gymnastics and so on. And there was a swing you know in a doorway, hung 1n a doorway which I used a lot. And at one point I do remember this. I fell off it and split open my chin. I still have the scar. After all these years. But sort of one of the memories that I have. And then my memory of you know my first day at school. When I was six."

You know in retrospect, there were you know discussions that went on in the house with other people that we weren\u2019t supposed to hear anyhow. I didn\u2019t really know what they meant. I think my sister knew much more. Realized much more but she did not know that she was a Jew either. And it wasn\u2019t until and I\u2019m not sure the exact time but it must have been early 1938. When the, there was an edict that Jewish children could no longer go to public schools and we had to go to a special school. Just for Jews. And that was the point at which our parents told us that we were -- no they didn\u2019t even tell us we were Jews. That came later. No they just told us we had to move schools."

He had gotten the what, Iron Cross. And he had a high position in a well-known bank. And that nothing would happen to him. And of course initially nothing did. And that was probably because I don\u2019t know who the Interior Minister was at the time. But my, again this is something I had learned later was that, that he told Hitler that if he rounded up all the Jews in Berlin at once, the economy of the city would collapse. And so he\u2019d better do it slowly. And I think that gave my father a false sense of safety."

She had no idea what, I mean that shows you, you know how totally isolated we were from that whole idea and then I guess the other thing came when we left. When we left Germany in January 1939.

He knew somebody who would keep him appraised of what was going on. And I think in 1932 he was told to get his children out of the country. And I think the rest of the family followed in 35. And they went to Switzerland cause they had relatives in Switzerland. And you know my father was helping various other more distant relatives.

And I don\u2019t remember what year it was, 1936 the Olympics were in Berlin. And my father had tickets to the Olympics and he took me to the opening ceremony. And that was the only time I saw Hitler. And I mean I was you know at school. Well that was different too. Once we went to the \u2014 but it just occurs to me now. You know at the public school we always had to say Heil Hitler. And it was, as far as I was concerned so that was just something you did. I think one of the things that gets 1s really terrible is with this never you know always obeying that you\u2019re told to do is that you don\u2019t learn that you don\u2019t have to do that. You know maybe at times. But it was \u2014 I loved the whole spectacle of the opening day."

It was very important for Germany to have it. And so he took us. The other, the other thing I remembered is that that I found very exciting. My father played tennis quite regularly and when it was finally deemed I was old enough to be a ball girl. For their tennis games. I loved that cause I could run around the court picking up the balls and so on. I have one other memory that is funny things that stick in your mind, which I don\u2019t think I told anybody about in the family. And it was that we were not allowed to buy from vendors, street vendors but I loved hot dogs dearly and whenever we went downtown or anything and by a hot dog stand, I always wanted to buy a hot dog. Was never allowed. Well one day I, there was a somebody came by with a cart and stopped outside the house we were living in. I have to tell you about that too. And so I saw him and you know everybody was doing something else and so I took some money out of my piggy bank and went outside and bought myself a hot dog and then hid it somewhere to eat it. And then went back in. And I felt so guilty. I just remember this you know, that I had done this terrible thing and nobody knew about it. But the other thing that happened and again I don\u2019t know whether it was 1937 or 38, we could no longer stay on the very nice first floor, ground floor apartment on the Augusta Victoria Strasse. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection We had to move to a smaller apartment . We could no longer have a cook and a maid and a nanny. I think we were, oh we were allowed to have somebody who was over 65 could work for us. So that all changed. And instead of a nanny we then had a woman who came and taught us languages I think. Taught us French and English, no. Not English; French it was. Whom I remember and who was very nice."

So. But this trip ok. Back to the trip to Switzerland. My mother had a little cushion that she took with her, a little pillow that she took with her everywhere. You know when she went traveling or anything. And in this case, 1t was with her when we were going to Switzerland on the train. And when we got to I think the first border crossing out of Germany, initially. In other words the German folks would be coming in to look at our papers and so on. She took this pillow, put it in the corner of the car, in the railroad car, sat me on it and said you are to sit on this and not move and not open your mouth. I was a talker. And but she said it in a tone of voice that I very rarely heard from her. So I knew this was serious. She said I am the only one going to do the talking. And anyhow so the Germans came in and looked at our papers. They were all ok. They asked my mother some questions. And then the train started again. And then this was repeated when we crossed the, into Switzerland. And it wasn\u2019t til years later when my sister and I were discussing how did we live at all because you know my parents left with almost no money. They did have some money in the states and I do remember later on that was always a great joy when a check arrived from a bank in the States. But that I think what was in that pillow was jewelry and presumably some money. I mean something that they could use. I can\u2019t think of any other reason for that particular thing and I mean they did have some money. You weren\u2019t allowed to take any money out, nothing at all. In fact \u2019'm amazed that the jewelry wasn\u2019t taken, with all of that. But I mean she didn\u2019t have a lot of jewelry left afterwards so that was the memory."

And do whatever you can because I don\u2019t think we are going to, I mean he didn\u2019t say anything more than that but, and so she did. And I think it was September first that she flew out. Right.

And then you know to be released from these camps, you really had to have somebody who would help you, you know, a lawyer and somebody who would help you with presenting your case as to why you were, well in my father\u2019s case, why he was in Britain with a you know three week visa. And so on. And he did not get good help at all. And so it took a long time for him to get released. It was much, much quicker for my mother. I mean there were, my aunt and uncle in Cambridge tried to get some of their British friends to write letters and so on to help. But I think we were -- my mother was released in where was I, in 41. Early in 1941. Well in May or June I think. And so we were too, my sister and I. And the question then was, where do we go? And my sister at that point was going to be sponsored by somebody in Cambridge, by the Jewish something. Group. In Cambridge. So that\u2019s where she was going. My mother felt that she wanted to be somewhere where when my father was released he could come to and there would be maybe some opportunities there for working or something. And so this, the Pariser family who had by that time moved to St. Albans which was a small, small market town but a beautiful town with a very old third century cathedral. And which the Romans occupied at one point and there were Roman baths still and so on. So it was a nice small town. And the Pariser family said you know that we could have the top floor of the house. So that was what my mother and father decided we should do and my father was still in there for at least another six months before he got out. And so that was a new place to go but, but it, I found it a lot better because I went to the high school there. That was also interesting because it was, I mean I was still only eight. But, but the high school no, I must be older, yeah. Right. But you know it was one that was -- you had school uniforms, blazers, hats and so on. And of course this was all an issue because we didn\u2019t have any money to buy these things. So I got stuff second hand. They arranged that. And I liked the school overall and I made friends there. And learned to play netball, to play basketball, only somewhat different. And I got a bicycle even though it was an old sit up and beg bicycle. I could go bicycle riding with my friends. And I did well in the school. They thought I didn\u2019t know the language probably so they put me in a lower class initially but then I got moved up to where I should have been. And I had a good friend who lived just up the road and whose mother was very nice to me. And sort of would find things that she said her daughter wasn\u2019t going to use any more and so on and give them to me. So that was actually a, overall a quite pleasant time.

They were working in London and so they would come back on weekends but you know they were there during the Blitz. And we were, I mean we would hear things go over. We were maybe twenty miles north of London and hear the planes go over. And then later the V-1\u2019s and V-2\u2019s, yeah rockets. And you know the V-2\u2019s if you didn\u2019t hear them anymore, you knew they were dropping.

And help out, but my father was very, very depressed at that time because he realized what a terrible mistake he had made. He clearly that wasn\u2019t really anything he was qualified to do in the country. Because he knew German law, not British law. And so he had a very hard time. And my mother for the first time in her life had to cook and she enjoyed that. She learned to cook from the cousin, who was a good cook. And then also she learned to sew. We used to go to the market on Saturdays and there was usually a truck there, a flat, a truck which had on it old things and that\u2019s where my bicycle came from for very little money. And one day we saw it and there was an ancient Singer sewing machine. You know the kind, the treadle kind. And so she said, hey that\u2019s what I want. And so somehow or other, she arranged to get them to deliver it. And she taught herself to sew. Again Hannah Pariser helped her. She knew how. And from then on she sewed all my clothes. She sewed my, when she could, my uniforms for school. And I did very well in school. The friend up the road and I we sort of competed, not very hard but as to who would be first in the class and who would be second. And she was smart. And This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And then maybe I could become really part of the group. But that was one thing my parents said absolutely not. You are not going to be in any outfit with uniforms. We\u2019ve seen enough of what goes on with those. And of course they didn\u2019t know anything about the Girl Guide movement. I got a Girl Guide book and showed it to them. And said you know it\u2019s all right and these are all good people. They said no. You can\u2019t do it. So that was very hard I found not to be able to, of course they\u2019d go to camp."

And all of it essentially free, because after, well there was a, you\u2019|l be interested to hear this. They had a Christmas pageant at the school every year. And because I could play the recorder they, I became annually the shepherd that led everybody else and I played \u201cSilent Night\u201d at the appropriate times. And so on. And I liked that. But again not what you would expect a Jewish refugee to do. I did have one bad experience with that whole thing because we would be given, well our costume as a shepherd, you dyed something in tea leaves and you know sewed it together and wore it. But I think a friend of mine was a bishop, somebody. And she had a miter that she was taking home. I don\u2019t know why she was taking it home. Anyhow.

I remember reading Shakespeare down there in the air raid shelter. And you know it just became so much part of our existence. And they played it on the school teams somewhat.

And I had gotten, I enjoyed being outside and looking at the flowers and insects and all those things. So I decided I\u2019d go into the sciences. And so that was 45, 46. 46. I switched schools and I went to Cambridge to the high school, my sister had been in the Per school which was a very good high school. I spent you could spend two years or three years there but I was very young so I actually spent three years. But also so that I hoped I would be able to get a state scholarship which would pay for everything when I went to university. If I stayed the extra year and got a distinction in the area that I wanted to go into. And that worked out. And I didn\u2019t apply, I applied to the two women\u2019s colleges in Cambridge university. And then I applied to Bedford College in London. You didn\u2019t apply to many places in those days, very much. And I got on the waiting list for Cambridge and I mean fairly quickly got told that I had gotten in. So I went to Cambridge University and went to Girton College. That was great. And particularly because virtually everything was paid for by the state and got a state scholarship. Oh yes, but the problem then came. In 1940, let\u2019s see where are we. In 1948 my father went back to Germany. My mother stayed in England in St. Albans cause she had gotten herself a job in working on interchange with high school German and English students. And so she loved that job and she loved being independent. But she stayed basically because I wasn\u2019t 18 yet. And that anyhow didn\u2019t help because it turned out that they didn\u2019t want to leave me in England without having citizenship because I was going to be alone. Well my sister was there. And so it turned out that you couldn\u2019t apply for citizenship until you were 21. So then we went through this period where my headmistress, various other people wrote letters for me This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

She will be alone in this country with, her parents will be in Germany. And she will have absolutely no status whatsoever unless she can become a citizen. And so eventually I became a citizen and when I turned 18. They agreed that this was reasonable. And then I applied for scholarships everywhere. And it was very funny because the county of Cambridge also provided scholarships with a lot of money if you needed it. And I was, I think my father said that he could provide 100 pounds a year or something. And but that was it. And so I needed my board and room, tuition and so on. And I got a state scholarship which actually paid for everything. And I got a letter from the Cambridge county congratulating me on getting state scholarship and they said and I have to tell you we are particularly grateful because you would have been by far the most expensive student we ever funded. So which I thought was a very nice letter at the time."

            "answer": "Right. And I was active in the student Christian movement. And I didn\u2019t have the problem that well, I mean I had a slight problem that my sister had with who of course was four years old. It was worse then. That she, well I think one boyfriend was particularly bad but that she was I think very fond of. And he of her. And I think she said one day you know I\u2019d really like to meet your parents. And he said, no this is, unfortunately they have a real problem. I can\u2019t take you home. And I think that happened to her a couple of times. To me only once when I had a boyfriend and his, I think his brother came to town and sister. And well sister in law. And they took us out for dinner. And they you know it was a perfectly ok dinner but I didn\u2019t measure up. So that was the end of that one. So it\u2019s, I mean I, I think I had a love hate relationship with Great Britain. And one of the conditions of my scholarship was that I had to teach for four years in high school science, after I graduated. So I spent a year in London, getting a teaching diploma which I enjoyed. And then I taught at Oxford high school for four years. And I liked teaching. I still like teaching. And it wasn\u2019t a hardship. But when the four years were up, I decided that I needed to do something else and I needed to get out of Britain and you know see what else was around to offer. And I wanted to do graduate work in freshwater biology which I had studied to some extent and taken my senior year students to various what do you call them. Field stations. Yeah. And to do work there. And so on. So I applied to a number of universities in the States and one of the teachers that was teaching 1n the same school I was, had been for a year to the states, and she said you should go do that. It\u2019s really good. And so I got a couple of scholarships to do that. And went to Ann Arbor, Michigan.

So I went to the University of Michigan. This was 1957. And to the zoology department there to study limnology. And as it happens my husband to be also was starting in the zoology department at the University of Michigan. It was his first job teaching there. And he had just done a post doctorate in Paris, so we didn\u2019t come back on the same boat. But that\u2019s what it felt like."

And they said oh yeah, we know, we know exactly where they\u2019re going to go and so we said where.

But that was a very, there was a lot of red lining in those areas and so on. The thing that I worked on mainly is that I started an after school program at the church, at the Episcopal church for the ghetto children.

But later on you know that\u2019s what life has dealt me. Do what I can with it. I mean I did really. I mean there\u2019s one, one other thing that has always struck me because it\u2019s a memory I have. As truly weird because I was always a good athlete and gymnast. And when I switched schools somewhere, I don\u2019t remember where it was in St. Albans. It must have been in St. Albans. When I went there. And they had, we had gymnastics you know two or three times a week. And then there were teams that competed against each other. And of course when I was new, then nobody knew that I was a good gymnast so when everybody was picking people for their teams. You know they still had that system. Fourteen leaders and each four picks. And so of course all the good ones get picked first. And of course as I realized that I was going to be obviously going to be picked last I thought and this 1s true. I thought well won\u2019t they get a pleasant surprise. I mean for somebody, however old I was, 14 or 13 years, for that to come to mind is either strange or just the way I\u2019m built."

And I\u2019ve been in touch with him and their family a lot.
