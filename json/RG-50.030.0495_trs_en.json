I mean part time, but took all the exams, because she already had a -- a diploma, university diploma, and became a qualif ied teacher of Russian, and knew a li -- Russian literature. So her friends -- there were a number of friends who were, you know, who thought that everything in Russia is fine, and considered living in Russia. Some considered leaving for Palestine, other for Russia. So discussion about -- some, in fact, left for Russia, unfortunately. In 1940 when -- when Russia took that part back, with Hitler\u2122s support, the people who were born in Russia had permission by law from Romanian aut horities to emigrate in Russia. And some of my parent\u2122s friend did, and lost their life soon thereafter, and after everything. So they discussed, I mean, other friends of my family, the family Gluckman, also the lady was a classmate of my mother, and a good friend. They also considered, but they decided to leave for Palestine. And 30 they did, and they were so smart. They left , they escaped the life, and my good friend, childhood friend Irma left with them, and grew in Palestine, then in Israel, was trained there. Then went to tea -- to study at Berkley, and became an economist. And years later, when both her parents, whom my mother retrieved by co rrespondence after the war, they reestablished contact, but both died and my mother lost contact again.

And my father quickly had to make some living and what they did was to transform th e front room of our house with the exit -- with the entrance, into a store. And to have a number of shelves built. And my father bought a few pieces of textiles, you know, to sell. But that was an improvisation because our home was not in a commercial district, nobody would come there. In addition our home was somewhere in the middle of a courtyard, it was not at the street. So nobody could see it, all passersby on the street 35 wouldn\u2122t no -- see nothing, just a big gate and the entrance to a big courtyard. So we had that in the front and he will go in the -- the commercial ce nter, talk to one merchant, to another and then possibly from time to time bring somebody, pull so mebody to our home. And that was always an event. So what happened, would he buy anything? And he became an intermediary in a way between people who had various textiles. He was a specialist engineer, he had more knowledge about those fabrics than the usual merchants of them, and how they are produced. And he would intermediate buying and selling because the commercial quarter still was alive, those people were not expelled, they were their own shops, and Iasi was a big city and there were a lot of people coming and buying their textiles, their, yo u know, clothes. By that time they were not ready made clothes, and they w ould buy everything from cotton for sh irts to -- to fabric for -- for trousers, to heavy coats and so on. So that was a very lively area. I know it because when I started to go through to school, I had always to cross that street, that long street, which was called Colonel Langa. So I know, and even before that, my father would take me sometimes and keep me by hand and we go from shop to shop and he will ask, do you need that, do you need that, you know? There is somebody who has such a thing, would you like to buy? He carried some kind of briefcase with samples, simply to make a living, because by having a small commission from mediating a sale, he would ge t a small commission, and that was a livelihood."

There was some bombing on -- on the town in the first week of the war. NNo big damage, I mean no damage at all in our ar ea. They might have fallen some other places, but as I recall, the newspapers didn\u2122t report any major damage from those bombing done by the Russians. However, those bombing were used as one of the pretexts to justify what became the -- that -- the pogrom, the massacre of the Jews of Iasi. Just one week after the war started, it was a 39 Sunday, it was -- the war started on June 22nd, that was June 29th, we were on the house and we saw that there are columns of people moving on th e street. We saw -- we had a view through the gate of the courtyard into the street, and you could see a narrow corner. We saw they were moving, we didn\u2122t know were [indecipherable] but they recognize there were Jewish people in those columns, so we understood that someth ing bad happened, and we\u2122re all kind of huddled. And sure enough, very soon, a group of individuals came in. There\u2122s some military, some police, some civilians, started knocking this first -- go - a couple of them, two, three, went to each one of the houses in the courtyard, and they started knocking the door, came to us, entered the house, opened -- pulled the door, entered the house and said, \ufb01Out, out, all Jews out, all Jews out.\ufb02 And violently pulling everybody from -- from the house away. This is when -- a moment which is remembered even by my brother, happened, as I mentioned before, in our house lived both grandmother\u2122s. My grandmother on my mother\u2122s side, was a short woman, rather heavy woman, and very religious, if I said that, really she was a -- a bearer of religion, she imposed on my mother to be very kosher for her, nothing was kosher enough, nothing, nothing. And she had speaking [indecipherable] she would berate my mother often for -- for -- this is relevant, I\u2122ll tell you why it is relevant, for not being kosher enou gh. So she was heavy, she was ill, and she was laying in bed, really laying in bed. And they were pull -- and they saw that woman is laying in -- in bed. So they say, \ufb01Out, come out.\ufb02 She barely spoke Romanian, but she wasn\u2122t able to move. So -- so one of them, very angry, went and -- and caught her by the hair and pulled. And there the hair came off. Because she was wearing a wig as a very, very Orthodox woman. And the guy wa -- and the guy said -- and -- and this is what my -- my brother remembered because he was two years, and sh -- he told me, down in there, he was so scared, saying that he -- he pulled all her hair. And -- and you know, my father was begg ing and praying, she\u2122s ill, she\u2122s very heavy, 40 she\u2122s very old, please, please forgive her, let her be there, she cannot move. They tried to pull her, but she was too heavy. And they realize that she will be unable to move into the column, so they left her in the bed, and pulled us, all of us. Fortunately they didn\u2122t shoot her on the spot, but this is why it was relevant that she was ve ry Orthodox, and -- and we were pulled, put in the columns, and then the column started moving, sl owly, slowly, because it was s-s-stopping at every next courtyard, and waiting for the Jews of that courtyard to be pulled. And the next courtyard was -- a friend of mine was living, a very good friend, Nuni Steinberg, who -- his family was pulled and -- and brought in our back , and put into the column. And so it was until the -- our entire street, that was street Colonel Langa, on which we lived, came to the main street. The main street had been already combed by prio r groups, so once we got to the main street, we simply marched, were marched further, we didn\u2122t have to stop because from the main street on, the place were already judenrein."

In the 29th in the morning they were surr ounding, and also killing, but o -- occasionally killing, mostly bringing them to the police. So as they brought column after column and -- and selected only the men, even the me n were too many for the courtyard. So the courtyard became full brim -- full to the brim, th ey couldn\u2122t push any more people in that. So people -- the column kept going -- they accumula ted in front of the -- so something happened that they brought -- my father described that exactly. They pushed some -- brought a table, two chairs and two Romanians officers, with a paper and a stamp, and making a list, and s -- started to call people come. And whoever was in the fr ont row started to move one by one. Say name, address and giving them a piece of paper, take it, with a stamp, that say he can go. Lieber, it was 46 written in that. And that gave them the permissi on to go out of the -- so, going out was another difficult moment, they had to run because again we re the beaters there. And people started to be freed from the -- the police to create room for ot hers to enter. And that apparently lasted for some time. My father saw that, he tried to be in the front, push himself, ran [indecipherable] and was beaten down and got up and got -- he was on the side come -- as I said, you know, and finally he got the line to go and got the thing and came out. This is very relevant because as we also learned later from other pe ople and the survivors, after awhile of giving those tickets to many people, not just to a few, to many, creatin g room, some German officers appeared there. They had a discussion with the Romanian officer , and they stopped giving out those things. From that moment they wouldn\u2122t give any more. Thos e who got it, got it. That accredited idea, that those who got the ticket and gave the address were kind of hereby enlisted for the future collection for labor camp, or maybe they thought of deporting them, who knows? But -- but the others who are -- in the meantime, the day was over, s -- dark started to -- to come down, and the columns stopped too. And that -- that I haven\u2122t see n, but I know from the st ories. And my father was home, this is how my father was home. I am telling my family story, not what happened, but I explain how he got home. So when he got ho me, my mother told him and they understood immediately, they said, \ufb01You have to hide. Yo -- they have your name, address, they can come after you. You have to hide.\ufb02 My mother re mained -- undressed, dressed again normally. And next to our ho-house in that big courtyard was a kind of -- the land, I cannot say the word in English. In Romanian it\u2122s a Ripa. It\u2122s a kind of little valley with some stream and a little small lake, I mean [indecipherable] in the bottom.

And we heard heavy beatings, and then screams, th-the door was already kind of barricaded and strong, but we were afraid, we couldn\u2122t resist, so immediately my mother called us. We we re dressed. We were asleep, but I was dressed, and my brother was dressed. And again my -- my grandmother was in bed, but the other was mobile.

And she found him, with Marcu, Marcu, you know, s-slowly, she [indecipherable] found him, he heard all -- sh -- he was very happy hearing that everybody is fine. He kind of understood because those people could be overheard as they spoke, and -- and cursed, you know, that they didn\u2122t catch us. He imagine what had happened. In short, he stayed there for three days and three nights. And my mother would go and bring him food and water and come back, and he would not come back into the house for the 49 fear that they will come again and -- and pick up the men, or the people, whatever. So he slept on -- on the -- the ground because of cour -- and on the fourth day he first came o -- in the meantime we started to learn through voices and people that a lot of people didn\u2122t come back. In our courtyard some came back, but others didn\u2122t. In the family Barad, which I believe I mentioned, only the woman with two children came back, the man was -- and he didn\u2122t ex -- ec -- access the -- the point to where they got the ticket. And I le arned that a lot of people were killed in the courtyard of the police, and that others were taken to -- to the train station. Again, I didn\u2122t know what happened, train station made it plausible that they were taken to some labor camp somewhere, to be -- as it turned out later, it was not a labor camp, but the -- the -- the si-situation a bit calmed in the sense that there were not ga ngs of people roaming the s -- the town to pull out the Jews. There were other things on their age nda because the war was already in the 10\u2122s or 12\u2122s or 13 days, you know, and the army broke through the Russian row -- armies -- and advanced, and all the news were very happy. The newspapers said, you know, the victory of that, and -- and it appeared that the interest in the Romanian Jews faded for the moment, it was felt. My father came, stayed in the house, didn\u2122t go ou t for months, weeks, I don\u2122t know. Kept me in the house, everybody stay, we -- the -- they exchanged food between neighbors. It was very, very little food; water we had. And this is how we passed the time after the th ing. Then, only later on, we started news to percolate, or at least for me to learn that in the -- what happened, that people were put in the trains. And these were the famous death trains of Iasi, which became, you know, the equivalent of Nazi chambers on the wheels. There were box cars stuffed with Jews to the brim, cars which normally couldn\u2122t take anything else but -- but, you know, bags and sacks and -- and freight. People were like sardines in a box, 150 - 200, I don\u2122t know, but it was full. And all the boxcars were filled, and then they sealed the boxcars so the doors cannot be opened, and 50 there is no air, and the train started to move a nd to go in a direction nobody was told. But in fact, they didn\u2122t go anywhere. It was moving between stations. If you ask me why it was moving, I don\u2122t know whether they didn\u2122t know where to go or whether one pulled -- I mean the -- the -- th-the -- there were soldiers on the train guarding those things, or whether they intentionally did that back and forth to kill the people in the [indecipherable]. But with no food, with no water, people started to scream and -- a nd die, in fact, and -- and were horrible scenes which were told by the survivors after several days, six or seven days, one of the trains reached a far away point, after shuttling far away, but a point which could have re -- be reached in several normal hours of train, and only a few of the people still were alive and were taken out. Another, second train, was in fact never moved farther away, they were s huttling between very close places. No, because it was -- people were screaming all the time, and th ey were stopping in stations, the soldiers wanted to stop to do their things, they also realized that people dead -- there were dead people, an-and they opened the door, and asked the people from the boxcar to throw out people who were dead. And they brought and throw them on the pavement. And th ey -- the -- those who were all right were not allowed to -- to come out, wa -- and they left on the pavement, sealed the doors again and the train left. Those who were there -- in some places there were some Jews in those little towns. Not in all, because before th e war, the Jews from the smallest places were forcibly relocated in the bigger towns. Was a political design in -- in fact. But this what happened, nobody knew at that time why. But in some smallest towns there were some Jews who were not on the trains and who were summoned to collect those people, and to bring them in the cemetery. In other places, they were simply loaded on horse drawn carts and dumped in the cemetery. Were some interesting scenes because as a train like that, scr eaming, comes and stays, and people hear of that, and some of the locals came too. Some cursed, some others tried to help. 51 And there are -- there are records made by the su rvivors who testified th at some of those who came really wanted to help, and to give them wa ter. Some traded the water and the people in the boxcar gave them rings, and gold, and whatever they had on them. Others simply grabbed and give them. One -- I remember that one of t hose who was reported doing so was recognized by Yad Vashem as among the Righteous of the People. And her name is there, and he\u2122s -- she\u2122s very much revered -- revered. Victoria Agarici is her name. She is being described by the survivors by setting the gendarme aside. \ufb01I don\u2122t care about y ou, I need to give water and bread to those people. Beat me if you want.\ufb02 And she broke through the rows and approached the train and gave people water. I mean, it\u2122s a very emotional, but this is the story, and she saved probably the lives of some of those people who were -- you know, people drank the urine of other people. There was a hole in the wooden -- in the board, they would struggle among themselves who could put his mouth on that hole to breathe some fresh air from outside. So horrible Dant\u00e9-esque scenes inside. And here was a good, honest woman, was willing to fight the police to do what she felt was right, and to give the food and to save other people. So this is what happened. This is how so -- the m -- the majority of the people who were put on the trains died on the tra -- either died on the train, or came out at the arrival point of the first train and died in the next several hours. And their numbers, which probably the Ho locaust Museum has, about how many exactly survived, and how many died, becau se statistics were kept, all -- all those by -- by the killers, and they reported so many corpses, which were [indeci pherable] in fact, there is a report which was discovered in the archives of the -- the special service, security service of Romania, who apparently organized the massacre of the Jews, ab out the total number of Jews who were killed. That was a report th-the pride, accomplishment and was reported by numbers, and the document exist which reports a -- a -- you know, a scary figure. If you can imagine that 13,100 or 200 52 people in total were killed in those days. And this was a report sent by the local unit of that special service to their superi ors, as an accomplishment. I couldn\u2122t give you my own opinion, I don\u2122t have a number, but I know how many I saw myself . But this is a total number, so they kept numbers also on the people who survived from the trains, and people who were unloaded. But I can again say that I saw in this -- in the 90\u2122s, when I was able again to travel to Romania, and I did travel. I got married in the meantime, here in the States, and I took my wife, who is American, and we went through the route of the Moldova, and stopped in all these little t-towns until we went to Iasi, where I was born and showed her, and then went further. She\u2122s also an anthropologist, Ruth Cernea, very interested in the story of my family, and the story of the Jews in -- in Romania. She\u2122s -- her field of study is Jewish culture, and the Passover Seder, which -- she wrote books on that. No -- well -- very well known anthropologist. And of course was interested herself in seeing what happened. And in those little towns, coming close to Iasi, where the train stopped, we visit cemeteries, and you ca n see huge graves, collective graves, in which those bodies were dumped, without any iden tification, nobody knows who was buried where. Shortly thereafter, the war, those common graves covered, you know, by soil and -- and branches got, you know, stone covers, and immediate after the war, the community, the town put huge slabs of concrete. It\u2122s not normal gravestone, bu t they are -- they are enormously impressive because you see slabs of concrete covering the co llective graves of those killed in the trains, which are stretching from here all the way to th e wall there, one after the other, one after the other."

And historical -- historical paradox and irony, and the sociological paradox is that those -- the graves of those killed in those -- in the massacres, are in several cemeteries not far from another corner of the cemetery, which cocontained the graves of people who were killed during the first World War, and in some prior war, which was called the War of Independence, wh en some Jews were allowed to fight for -- in the army. Still distinguished as Jews, but they\u2122re very willing to fight and proud to fight for the independence of Romania. And then they were buried in the Jewish cemetery, where their remains were brought because they were Jews, in -- but the Jewish communities were very proud that part of their community gave their lives in the fight and in the war for Romania\u2122s independence. It was a matter of honor, and the desi re to make their contribution to the country and identify with the right cause of independence of the country they were living. And that corner of cemetery, the heroes of the independence war, and of the first war is always treasured, and kind of honored specifically. And next to it you can see the -- the Jews killed in Romania in a massacre, in a pogrom which was the -- the premonition of what was to happen in the next year on a even larger scale to so many ot her hundreds and thousands of Jews."

No, th -- and real things happened, it was not simply a -- an anonymous or kind of general unexplained fear. My father for instance, and other Jews, receiv ed a paper which was called Call Order. Was a military paper from the military service saying -- and this was tha -- six months we -- after the -- the massacre, in beginning of \u212242. They say, here by you are informed that you are to deliver to -- to work as labor -- forced labor. You are part of a team number 38, or some number, under the team leader is so and so. This is the place wh ere you have to be present when called. The calls will be made publicly, by public speakers and other ways, and you immediately have to present yourself at that place, under severe penalties. Signed, the milita ry circle of Iasi. So we received 57 that, and that document I -- I remember was the -- the scariest of all. So finally they said they are coming now around to put out all the Jews, to ro und them up and to send, and this is even official, and not unan -- announced. And with -- ma ke -- happen all the day because there is no today. And so you lived in fear that that order would be executed any time, and would not know what would happen to -- to him, or to us. And sure enough, shortly thereafter that order came another one asking him to -- to come to be pres ent for forced labor at the place, which was the address of the train station. Now this was a train station from where the -- the death trains were sent out. And here is a paper asking him to come there and -- a nd work, so you can imagine what he thought. Will he ever come back, or are they all rounding them up there under some kind of order, pretext, whatever. They will load them on th e train and here it will happen again, they will be killed, taken away, you will never see them. On the other hand, he couldn\u2122t not go. How could he not go, because it was obvious they had his name and his address and in full. So, with all the fear in your heart, and other people also received, so it was a collective -- and the rumor mill kkept going, did you receive, did you receive, I did receive, I didn\u2122t receive, why didn\u2122t that receive, what will happen. So on the appointed day, he was all dressed, equipped with heavier because it was a cold winter, with a package, you know, to last him, and he was summoned and he had to go to the train station. At the train station they were all put to shovel snow, and clean that and clean that, and we were waiting, waiting. And it was the explosion of joy when at the end of the day we saw him back. We didn\u2122t know whether he will come back. And he worked there for I don\u2122t know how many, a -- a week, or [indecipherable] and he came back every day, and others came back. They did not send those -- them again or ki ll them. Was hard work, forced labor, but they all came back. But wi th the indication that they can be called again any time.

Indeed we saw -- we saw that although the census was made, and my card bears the date of the census, which was June, I believ e, \u212242, and one month, tw o months later, nothing happened. There was evidence of who are the Je ws, but nothing happened. At the same time, which was a very important factor, the Romanian ar my was victorious. It was far away, deep into the Soviet Union, and -- and there was a -- a -- a sense of triumph in the Romanian community and clearly they were -- there were a lot of things being stolen from Russia and coming in, it was known there is a -- trains of items were brought a nd officers came with cars loaded, military cars with their own build -- I mean, their items stolen and -- so somehow the concern with the Jews decreased a bit, and we felt that.

A lot of times there is, you know, a chair, and the shtender at a chair. Here we were given the shtenders to be able to use the boxes to put our copy books -- prayer books. It wa sn\u2122t proper equipment for children, that was made for ad-adults, but I remember very well how we learned. We had teac hers and we went to school. We had breaks, you know, we played in the breaks and a bit of normalcy seeped in. And this was end of \u212242 - \u212243, and then Stalingrad happened, and then we became happy, and the Romanians, and the others peopl e there started to understand that the war is turning. And since [indecipherable] and casualties were on the Romanian side pretty severe -- very severe in fact, because the Germans put always the Romanian troops and regiments in the -- in the fire, you know, in the most dangerous, and there were many casualties and losses. So the situation turned generally grim, but we were able to -- to learn about what is happening, and some hope started to -- to come up, that the Germans are going to be defeated, and the war is going to be turned around. So that gave us a bit of hope, our hope grew. The situation generally didn\u2122t worsen, and it didn\u2122t worsen for Jews as it was -- became appare nt much later, I did not have any way myself 66 to learn that, but for the overall picture it appeared that the politicians, including the government, Antonescu, realized sooner than we did that the war is turning and then the risk of being -- killing the Jews is 10 times as high because they may be a -- become accountable. So the -- the state\u2122s anti-Semite activities did not grow, or did not expand their -- I am not aware of any other massacre or pogrom, or further very severe -- I don\u2122t recall my father being called again in \u212243 to -- to do forced labor and now I understand, I mean there are documents which show that the -- the government wanted to -- to change course. They send also representatives on the sly to contact the allies, without Germany knowing. And that was \u212243, in \u212244 Romania turned sides already. So for us the situation was better on that . Still fear, still Jews. We had an episode of wearing the yellow star in the period of \u212241, I don\u2122t recall in -- exactly how long, but I still have the yellow star and -- two yellow stars, in f act. One was also exhibi ted in New York, and -- which were mine, my -- my mother kept that too, which were sewn on garments when we had to go out of the house, and stayed on the garments excep t that if we had to change the garments, we had to move those things. So there was -- that situation of living between how do you I say it, one fear and the other, and one hope and a nother hope. Until -- but then, you know, the -- the sense of hope and the sense of possible escape started to soon -- rather s-soon to disappear again because the Russians were successful in pushing the Germans and the Romanian armies back. And that increased the -- for us, th-the sense of fear that if they are defeated, and if they are going to retreat, we can be again in great jeopardy, and another massacre may occur when the armies will be here. That was one -- one thing. The other thing which happened in that - those years, is news percolated to us that our relatives were deported, or -- but some of them may be in camps. Not -- not specifically was about our relatives, but news about the Jews in Bessarabia.

Whom did you find? She found, in -- in -- not she, he found, in a camp farther away from Balti, the family of one of her brother -- brothers, Yosl, with two of his children and his wife. The two children were Zioma and Uca. And as, you know, the -- then I learned that from my mother, the details, b ecause it\u2122s -- it\u2122s such an extraordinary story, and how did he found -- he was going from camp to camp, and asked do you know somebody from -- and no, no. And then so mebody told him, in that camp may be somebody with that name. And he we nt, apparently towards Marculesti, or -- I have to remember 70 -- one of th-the camps was Marculesti, and the ot her was Cecilnica. I don\u2122t recall which one was that, but -- and then somebody else, we have got your family here, and they pointed there and he goes and he found one -- one of the two younger brother, and not -- not my mother\u2122s fa -- brother, and the mother of the two boys. And i ndeed it was her family, and she said, \ufb01You know, I am the doctor, I was sent by Shanya Catz, and she\u2122s your relative.\ufb02 And then they told him the whole story and what happened to them, and they came, and the address. And my -- those people are my cousins. There were four brothers. So the story was that one of the four got sepa -- when they were marched -- th-the -- the whole thing is that the Jews of Balti were marched, walking by -- by soldier of the Romanian army on horses. Put in column and marched for tens of kilometers to be evacuated out of Balti. When the army entered they were first put in a prison, in the Balti prison. They were kept there a couple of weeks or some shorter time, and there they were started to march. If you look -- to march them to the east --"

And he found them -- and then were stayed in houses emptied by people who went when the Russian army retreated, they -- many people evacuated with -- together with the Russian army. And those camps were not in the system of the German camps, you know, the barracks were well organized German style, were simply improvised, the same way like the -- 71 you know, the -- the -- the killing of the Jews in the pogrom, which I already told you, was a very artisanal killing."

            "answer": "I mean, in death trains, you know, hacking them to death, it was not the gas chambers, the type of thing, the horrible. And maybe the f act that, you know, the gas chambers are so well known is not due only to the huge numbers but to the industrialized manner of killing Jews. Here it was more the traditional manner was used, you know, kill directly, or the innovation was putting them on trains. But i-in the camps were -- do the same th ing. They were herded to a place, compelled to work, or left abandoned there, fell on the ground, found someplace to sit down. And then in a week or two days or three days or maybe two months, when the new order came, or when the soldiers rested, they were shep herded further. So he came back and told us that my uncle Yosl died of starvation and -- a nd illness. He was not shot, but he caught typhus and -- and he died in the arms of his sons. That the -- his wife is alive, Surka, Aunt Surka. Who was, as it happened in a Jewish family, she was also the youngest sister of my grandmother. So the grandmother, my grandmother married as a second wife, her husband, who had sons from the first wife. Some of the sons were much older th an [indecipherable] young people. So one of them at the -- some point, married the you ngest sister of my grandmother. So the son married the sister of his father\u2122s wife, second wife. But it was perfectly [indecipherable]. And she became -- and she gave birth to four sons, who are my direct first cousins. And the story came that one of them, in that terrible evacuation being herded, separated from the family a nd was lost. As it turned out, he didn\u2122t separate by chance. He wanted to -- to run away and to run away with the Russians and 72 to reach the Russians and to fight. And he did succeeded, went east on his own, crossed the front line, reached the Russians line, and became a soldie r. And for the entire war in the Russian army, all the way to Germany, survived. Was crippled, unfortunately, and remained cripple -- shorter leg for -- but came back alive. And we are very proud of him because he wanted to fight and he fought the Nazis to -- to the end. And -- and then another one, who lived not with his father in Balti was caught in an -- another thing, and also a pparently left and was on the Russian side. So to escape that war and the camps, the father di ed, the boys survived, and the mother survived. And the doctor brought us the information only a bout those who he fou -- he found in the camp, we -- at that time we didn\u2122t know about those who fought in the army. And then next time when he went, my mother gave him money, gave him a blanket, gave him me dication. Not too much, because he couldn\u2122t carry. He went back to the same camp, found them and gave them the blanket. Now imagine what it means in that co ndition to receive something like from heaven, you -- you get, and it was -- and they never forget. I met th-the cousin Zioma, one of them I mentioned, I believe before, that I met him in Balti years later and then he went to Israel. The youngest one, Uca, is fortunately still a-alive. He left the Russia earlier than his older brother, he came to Canada. And he\u2122s still alive in Canada, and I talked to him on the phone a few days ago. And he -- he -- you should interview him because he was in camp. I was not directly in camp, I was with the massacres, but his story is extraord inary, how he -- they were moved from camp to camp, marched in -- in the worst conditions, not fed. How he had to go and steal and bring home some food for people, how his father died in his hand, sick and no-not medicated by anybody. The stories are horrible, but he is alive. He is almost 80 or more. And he has his daughter and son and they live in Toronto. If you want I will give him your --"

In fact, however that massacre was o-of a magnitude unprecedented in Europe. Even at Kristallnacht in Germany, there were no 13,000 Jews killed. A lot of destru ction, and a number of victims, but not 13,000 Jews. So that was th-the first big event on the European scale of killing Jews en masse. Maybe in 75 Poland it happened too, in \u212239 or \u212240, I don\u2122t know. But then it was repeated in Odessa, it was repeated in Kiev. Babi Yar was a clear copycat of that, these people brought and killed in front of their trenches and [indecipherable] there.

Chaya is the mother of my grandfather, Zollman Mayhel Faerstein. And this picture was taken apparently about exactly a century ago in 1905, or maybe 1906 because the family\u2122s story is that they left Balti at that age in that state. Apparently they were above 70 or even more, deciding to leave their family behind and going to the Holy Land to die there and to be buried in the Holy Land. And lo and behold, they had the courage, the stamina, and the strength, to accomplish that dream, and left Balti in 1906 or 1907. Finally they arrived in Jerusalem. I don\u2122t know how they did it, becaus e they spoke only Yiddish and maybe a bit of Russian and they had to travel, of course, by horse , and by cart until they got to the train and then from the train they should have crossed the sea by boat, and then to arrive, but they made it. And they arrived in Jerusalem, lived Maya Sharim. As you can see he\u2122s -- has a beard, and has payas and the -- the traditional caftan. And my mother and I visited the cemetery in which we knew that they were buried. And that was still during my mother\u2122s life, and my mother discovered in the books their names. And we found their -- he r grave in the cemetery of Jerusalem on the Mount of Olives. We didn\u2122t find Ushar\u2122s grave because Ushar grave was desecrated by the Jordanians when they controlled that part of Jerusalem. Last year I spent six weeks in Jerusalem at the Hebrew University, and I went back to retrieve the -- the grave of my great great greatgrandmother. So fi -- I did find it, cleaned the -- the gravestone, her name is there, exactly when she died, and I brought the pictures back to my gr andchildren. I would hope to get there with my grandchildren so they get a tangible sense of heritage, of -- of family history. And I still try to 108 find out, to construct the full family tree, which -- for which I have a lot of data, but I have to put it on a good chart."

He was a -- a s -- a very small shopkeeper, is a grocer. They were rather poor. My other grandparent in the prior picture had a workshop producing soap, also very artisanal thing. But as you can see, he was also very distinguished in his looks, with a very respectable beard. Kind of stiff in the picture, unusual for him to be photographed. His wife Chava is the person whom I described to you as my grandmother who was rather short and heavy. You can see that he is sitting and she is standing and they are almost the same height, because she wasn\u2122t very tall and she grew bi gger. The young man there is my father at a young age. He was in his teens, I believe; my fa ther, Marcu Catz. I believe he was maybe 16 - 17, because his brother, Bernard, my Uncle Bernard is not in the picture, otherwise he would have been in the picture. The reason he is not is that he had to leave the town in which they left, Roman, because he was -- he got involved in some political activities a bit of the left, and he was badly beaten up and threatened. We have some pi ctures in the family of his being bitten -- I mean, the wounds he -- he endured in that beating and it was unsafe for him to stay so he left -- had to leave with his left leanings to Paris, wh ere he could practice them a bit more. And then he left France for Canada where he established a fam ily, but married in the t ypical Jewish way with a girl he met on the boat, and established the fa mily. He\u2122s had one son, Ch arlie Kent, my cousin, 110 who established a very beautiful family, the Kent family with four children in Toronto and Phoenix and the States. Many grandchildren. Charlie married -- marri ed Ida, who is still alive. My uncle -- Charlie Kent passed away, but they helped decisively in the -- in taking out my brother Zolly from Romania. In fact, ransomi ng him with money from the govern -- Romania\u2122s government, and this is how Zolly and his family arrived in Canada. But Bernard, unfortunately, is missing from this picture."

The name of my father is up there, Marcu L from Leib, Catz . The -- the threat was terrible because it does not -- it did not specify what will happen to them. Other Jews from Iasi received the same order, and the fear was that this is a sy stematic call again to -- to eliminate them, to kill them. Indeed then it was -- became known that they have to present themselves, the specific place was the railway station, exactly the same st ation where the Jews in the -- were put on the death train. So then my father was informed that he has to be present at a certain day there, together with other Jews. And with fear in hi s heart, he had to go. The bureac -- and he went. Fortunately we saw him back. But this second do cument is the certificat e which the military bureaucracy handed over to him to -- as a proof that he indeed responded to the call and was there.

The census for 113 inhabitants having Jewish blood. I mean, this is -- they were not mincing words. The ethnic bias is clear, blood bias.

I was on a World Bank mission to Moldova for developing programs which the bank was developing for Moldova, in my capacity the senior advisor at that time at the bank for social policies. I also spoke the language of course, so I went on that mission, an d I took a few days off from the work problem to be able to visit my town, Balti. At that time I wanted to see the synagogue in which my -- my grandfather was pray ing in his time, but it had been destroyed long before by the war, and very little was left from Balti -- from past Balti. So I was told however that the new synagogue was created in a home, which was built like a usual home, a dwelling, but in -- it\u2122s used as a synagogue and was taken there. And then I saw there indeed, in \u212294, through the people who are living in Balti, the Jews living in Balti, in a -- in a Saturday morning, with a full service done as -- by usual service. My leader, th-the person who brought me there was my cousin, first cousin, Zioma Faerstein, who was -- whom I mentioned before, who was living with his family still at that time in Balti, in \u212294. He took me to the synagogue and 114 explained to me -- I -- I wanted to have some kind of memory and I asked whether I can have something from that -- they say we cannot give you any sidur, because we have very little sidurim, there are not enough, we don\u2122t have any ot her items. But I notice in that corner, some cardboards with some inscriptions. I say, \ufb01What are these?\ufb02 They say, \ufb01Well, these are things which we had to write when we opened up -- came back from -- from the camps and there were a lot of people who died in the camps, and those who stayed alive wanted to say Kaddish after them, pray. But they didn\u2122t know to the Kaddish, the Hebrew Kaddish words. So we had to write the Hebrew Kaddish with Slavic -- with Cyrillic letters so they can pronounce, reading in Cyrillic letters, the -- the words of the Kaddish. At that time we wrote -- we created the black -- the cardboards, and these are some of them.\ufb02 On the right hand corner you can see the Hebrew word from Kaddish, the dollit is missing. Only k-u then sheen. On the left hand corner is Kaddish the same word with Cyrillic letters, and then the wh ole Kaddish is written in Cyrillic letter. [speaks Hebrew] ________ and so on. And this is a prayer which Jews from all the entire world are saying in the memory of those whom they lost. It was very moving to me to see that -- that document, historic document improvised, a pro duct of the Holocaust whose -- who was needed because of the Holocaust, who will -- had to be manufactured by hand because there was no prayer books. And I ask whether I can have at least one of them to me. They said you can have them all because by now we have [indecipherable] . And they ended up giving me three of them. So I brought them with me. One is this one, an other one is in the Holocaust museum in New York. The third one is with me still, waiting if your Holocaust museum, Joan, want to exhibit it, I\u2122m happy to -- to give it there. It is extremel y meaningful for me because it is from the same town I was born and from the synagogue, but I believe it\u2122s meaningful for the entire history of 115 what the Holocaust mean -- meant, and how people came out of the Holocaust having to cry for those whom they lost."
