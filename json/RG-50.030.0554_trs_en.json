            "answer": "No, when my mother \u0152 my mother \u0152 my mother before the war was always advising to leave to South America, because a cous \u0152 my ma \u0152 my \u0152 my \u0152 my grandma cousin, first cousin was living in Buenos Aires and did well. So sa \u0152 always like a possibility which my mother always considered in the thir \u0152 in the late 30s. But my \u0152 my father was too attached to, you know, position, he wa \u0152 the business was going well, and you know. They thought the war \u0152 nothing will happens, you know, so he was optimistic. So they never fled away. And once was the war start, like everybody else, we \u0152 we have to move into the ghetto. And the reason why my mom were not ta -taken and myself, and my sister, we were the three survivors, is because we didn\u2122t live in the same place where my grandmothers live and the family. And me \u0152 my \u0152 my father, the older men of the family, he \u0152 he was there with \u0152 with the rest when they close and they ah \u0152 they emptied the building and took everybody away. So, my mom wa s \u0152 when she said well \u0152 she wa \u0152 she Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 7didn\u2122t \u0152 she didn\u2122t have any doubts that th is is not for taking her to the working camps, that was for extermination. So she says, I am not waiting here for \u0152 for death, I am \u0152 I am running away. If I will be caught on the \u0152 on the run, at least I tried to do something for my life. So she \u0152 you kn ow, was corruption, like everywhere else. So she \u0152 she paid the people to let us go, and they supposed to supply us with documents, aray \u0152 Aryan documents on the other side. They \u0152 they didn\u2122t follow to do that, they send us a Gestapo. So, my mother was waiting and that took her a little bit more than she \u0152 sh-she \u0152 es \u0152 expect to take. So she was very am \u0152 you know, nervous and watching if the peopl e are coming and bringing the document. And then sh-she showed me the Gestapo car coming. So from the \u0152 from the back of the building we run away, just in time. So s \u0152 as \u0152 close calls like this, we had a couple of them. Even when we was trying to leave Poland after the war, where the \u0152 the Iron Curtain was established by the Russians. So, in order to get out of Poland to the western Germany was a ri \u0152 also risking a life. But coming back to those times \u0152 so we \u0152 we left \u0152 we left the ghetto, and my mother remember from her young age that her father was taking the family to sp end the summer to a place called Sandomierz on the south \u0152 on \u0152 a \u0152 a little bit south of Warsaw on the bank of the Wisa river. And so sh \u0152 in order to run from Warsaw, she went there with us. And that was a mistake, because in a small place, ou-ou-outside there is Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 8noticeable immediately. So, very, very shor t time after, we were on our way back to Warsaw. And of course those \u0152 those voyages cost money, and we \u0152 we didn\u2122t have too man \u0152 too much of it. So shortly after bri \u0152 getting back to Warsaw, her economical resources had been exhausted, and was not much to do, so she just present herself to a friend of her, made from school, from the elemental school, a Christian lady who was married to a policem an, also Polish. And she says, well, if you refuse to help me, I understand. It\u2122s a big risk. But if you can\u2122t, I have no one to call any more, you know. So \u0152 and she, she did so. She said, wait. She hold us all the day there until the fire \u0152 the husband comes from work, and then she spoke to him by herself. And he comes convince by her \u0152 his wife, to help us. And they advise \u0152 the plan when he \u0152 what he co mes with was the following. My sister, she was a blonde with blue eyes, that\u2122s no problem. And \u0152 so she went to a \u0152 with \u0152 with \u0152 were nuns."
