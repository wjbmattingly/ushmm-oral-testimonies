            "question": "So, after the war started, what ha \u2014 what had happened to your family? Did they try to escape Warsaw, or \u2014",
            "answer": "No, when my mother \u2014 my mother \u2014 my mother before the war was always advising to leave to South America, because a cous \u2014 my ma \u2014 my \u2014 my \u2014 my grandma cousin, first cousin was living in Buenos Aires and did well. So sa \u2014 always like a possibility which my mother always considered in the thir \u2014 in the late 30s. But my \u2014 my father was too attached to, you know, position, he wa \u2014 the business was going well, and you know. They thought the war \u2014 nothing will happens, you know, so he was optimistic. So they never fled away. And once was the war start, like everybody else, we \u2014 we have to move into the ghetto. And the reason why my mom were not ta-taken and myself, and my sister, we were the three survivors, is because we didn\u2019t live in the same place where my grandmothers live and the family. And me \u2014 my \u2014 my father, the older men of the family, he \u2014 he was there with \u2014 with the rest when they close and they ah \u2014 they emptied the building and took everybody away. So, my mom was \u2014 when she said well \u2014 she wa \u2014 she Interview with William Kisielewski \u2018 November 8, 2008 didn\u2019t \u2014 she didn\u2019t have any doubts that this is not for taking her to the working camps, that was for extermination. So she says, I am not waiting here for \u2014 for death, I am \u2014 I am running away. If I will be caught on the \u2014 on the run, at least I tried to do something for my life. So she \u2014 you know, was corruption, like everywhere else. So she \u2014 she paid the people to let us go, and they supposed to supply us with documents, aray \u2014 Aryan documents on the other side. They \u2014 they didn\u2019t follow to do that, they send us a Gestapo. So, my mother was waiting and that took her a little bit more than she \u2014 sh-she \u2014 es \u2014 expect to take. So she was very am \u2014 you know, nervous and watching if the people are coming and bringing the document. And then sh-she showed me the Gestapo car coming. So from the \u2014 from the back of the building we run away, just in time. So s \u2014 as \u2014 close calls like this, we had a couple of them. Even when we was trying to leave Poland after the war, where the \u2014 the Iron Curtain was established by the Russians. So, in order to get out of Poland to the western Germany was a ri \u2014 also risking a life. But coming back to those times \u2014 so we \u2014 we left \u2014 we left the ghetto, and my mother remember from her young age that her father was taking the family to spend the summer to a place called Sandomierz on the south \u2014 on \u2014 a \u2014 a little bit south of Warsaw on the bank of the Wista river. And so sh \u2014 in order to run from Warsaw, she went there with us. And that was a mistake, because in a small place, ou-ou-outside there is Interview with William Kisielewski \u00b0 November 8, 2008 noticeable immediately. So, very, very short time after, we were on our way back to Warsaw. And of course those \u2014 those voyages cost money, and we \u2014 we didn\u2019t have too man \u2014 too much of it. So shortly after bri \u2014 getting back to Warsaw, her economical resources had been exhausted, and was not much to do, so she just present herself to a friend of her, made from school, from the elemental school, a Christian lady who was married to a policeman, also Polish. And she says, well, if you refuse to help me, I understand. It\u2019s a big risk. But 1f you can\u2019t, I have no one to call any more, you know. So \u2014 and she, she did so. She said, wait. She hold us all the day there until the fire \u2014 the husband comes from work, and then she spoke to him by herself. And he comes convince by her \u2014 his wife, to help us. And they advise \u2014 the plan when he \u2014 what he comes with was the following. My sister, she was a blonde with blue eyes, that\u2019s no problem. And \u2014 so she went to a \u2014 with \u2014 with \u2014 were nuns."
