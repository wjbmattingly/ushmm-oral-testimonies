The people saw th -- especially for the Jewish people, they look and study, they\u2019Il be able to study, they\u2019Il be free, they will -- for example, I'll tell you a story. I was in my school, as I told you, it also was with a left direction, and when Russia gave Vilnius up to the Lithuanian, they came with their propaganda to the schools, and ask the children if they want to study and have their freedom, they can go to Russia, to Byelorussia, to Ukraine. And they can study free, and they can became teachers and engineers and what, and they\u2019 II have their freedom. A lot -- and who wants? We can make lists, and tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, they can leave. And lots of the older classes of the children, they scribed themself in the lists. And they are going to Byelorussia to work, to -- to study, to the schools, and they -- and they left very warm and nice families. And left during the week to Russia. And weg -- they came there -- of course they came into the schools, to the university, one -- get the teacher th -- and they -- but they saw the hard life of there. They saw that the reality is different. And they didn\u2019t have a way back. They couldn\u2019t go back to their parent. And you know, children, they tried, that -- but they left their parents, their homes, and it was lot of them. And one of them was a sister of a good friend of mine. And they went after, and they start to study, of course they were hungry, they didn\u2019t have what to wear, they have -- and they were homesick. And after a couple of months, or a half a year, they came again with lists. Who wants to go to see their parents, to the -- of course lots of people said they want. And the sister of my friend also [indecipherable] she want to go to Wilna, back to see the parent. And they instead to send -- and after awhile, instead to send them back to Wilna, they send them to Siberia. A lot of them. And this girl, her name was -- now she [indecipherable] after the -- after the war she get married. And she went there, and she was working very hard, and she was in the forest to cut the trees, and they gave her a little warm jacket, and some big shoes, and the [indecipherable] worked very, very hard, and we didn\u2019t have any information. One thing was good, the whole family was killed, and she was alive. And she worked very hard, and in -- it was the -- the patriation from the -- the Polish citizens after the war. I think it was in \u00b047 - \u201948 that they can return to Poland to get their Polish citizenship. She describe herself [indecipherable] return to Poland and then she went to -- to [indecipherable] or somewhere, and finally she came to the United States. When I came to the United States in \u201976, I met her, and she told me all the stories. Her family was killed, and she was working the place I am working now, and she recognize me as the friend of her sister. And she said, \u201cYou know what, I have a job for you. If you will be accepted,\u201d she said, \u201cI am working for the Jewish labor committee in New York, and I am getting married\u201d -- he -- a second time her husband also died young. \u201cAnd I\u2019Il introduce you, because they need a Jewish secretary.\u201d My English was very poor in that time. And she bought me in, and only one person spoke Yiddish, the other spoke English, was a broken English. She introduced me to the executive director, it was a [indecipherable] in that time. And he said, okay, if you will take a course of English, if you would take a course of -- of typing. If you would take this and this, come after three months, and she\u2019s working o -- for three months you\u2019re working, and we\u2019ll -- she\u2019Il show you the work, and then we\u2019ll come and we'll see. I did everything he said, I took a course of English, I took a course of typing. My Yiddish was -- it was very good years ago, but for the 30 years I was in Russia, I forget also. But I try to remember, and I worked very much the job because I was 52, and I still don\u2019t want to be a bargain on my children. I want a little bit my own life. And she\u2019s show me a lot, the girl. And after three months I came. Of course my English was very poor, and my typing a letter that I supposed to type now in five minutes, I type in that period of time for an hour. But the Yiddish was Okay. He said we\u2019ll take you to try, three months, and I was trying, but it still was very hard. And the most horrible thing was for me to take the telephones. I mixed up the names, I -- he dictate me an letter, my boss, and I tried to write everything like he said. And when I came for his signature he crossed out one, two, three, four. I said, \u201cWhy are you crossing out? I typed everything you said.\u201d He said, \u201cAnd I said I didn\u2019t say, but you are a secretary, you have to make the letter -- letter right.\u2019 Later on, when he gave me a letter, I get friends with some of the other secretaries, who are English secretaries, Linda, please check, make the correction. She made the corrections, I [indecipherable]. Anyway, it was three months and they still didn\u2019t -- we\u2019ll take another three months. I was nervous, will I stay at the job? And the Yiddish start to be a little bit less, and nobody knows the Yiddish, only English. Only one person. Finally they -- I think that get -- they get used to my personality, and they accepted me. And during the years I learned, and they gave me things that I don\u2019t need too much, the language like traking -- taking track of the membership, or of the federation stuff, who was -- and they picked up, and meantime I learned, and I am there for 23 years. Still working, in spite when I came was 18 people at the staff, and now is seven, I am still within the seven, not knowing so well the language. But I doing other things that are enough important and the [indecipherable] were occupied."

So if they know each other, they describe them as a wife, and went out with them as a wife. My mother didn\u2019t have such a -- and she -- she didn\u2019t have a hiding place, and she was still in the ghetto. And my sister was with her all the time looking, something for her. And she left her of five minutes, she has to go to somebody, ask if they have for her a hiding place. And my mother saw that she is -- my sister will not leave her alone, and she was [indecipherable] what should she do. And she has in her pocket a couple of da -- of rubles, of money. She said, I have to meet her in five minutes, but I\u2019Il try to go to the exit. Maybe somehow I will go out [indecipherable]. And she went to the exit -- no, I'll tell you about -- later how she went out. My sister returned to the place where my mother has to meet her, my mother didn\u2019t return. She come to there, where is my mo -- I can\u2019t find the mother. And she was crying and I was crying and we\u2019re looking for my mother, my mother disappeared. We went to the working place, and to the places where they put us. They put us to the other ghetto, before it was two ghettos, from one side of the street and from the other, and all of a sudden they liquidated one ghetto. And they put them to the Ponary. And in that ghetto they liquidated the [indecipherable] and the people from the ghetto out, somewhere out to the places where they\u2019re working and some were to the second ghetto wa -- what was empty out, for the couple of days. And I was wer -- crying. My mother wi -- I didn't know where she 1s, she was killed, she was shot, or -- all the three day -- three days we were in the other place. My friend Josef was working for the Gestapo -- the Gestapo [indecipherable] yeah, doing all kind of -- of hard work. And he has a Polish woman who worked in their house for 40 years. And she used to come to him where he worked, every day. And he went out -- we were in the second ghetto, and he went out for the w-work every day. And he knew how I was crying and he told Vera, the woman, what happened to my mother, and the -- and they don\u2019t know where she is, and Rochola is crying all the time. She said, \u201cYou know what, Ill go to the place where she was living before the war, maybe somehow she went out of here.\u201d She went to the place when -- where I lived, and she find a letter from my mother, that she gave some money to the policeman and he let her out. She took out her stars, and she went out the place to the camp my father and my brother-in-law was all -- almost working at the [indecipherable]. And she went by our house where we lived before, and she -- she saw that we will be concerned, and she left a letter that she\u2019s safe and she went to my father. And this woman, Vera, risk of her life, and she went there -- she went -- and next day she brought my boyfriend Josef the letter from my mother, and he brought it in the second ghetto, and telling that my mama is alive and she is together with my father on to -- in the [indecipherable]. We returned after awhile to the ghetto to find that lots of, lots of people were taken out. They said that they take that -- took them to work. They said that they -- they are alive. But somehow thoughts came in that people who are alive, they may be surround with the -- with the worst enemies, but somehow one of the thousands, thousands of people can find a connection and send something to the relatives, a sign that they are alive. If such signs doesn\u2019t come from anybody, it means that they are not alive. But people, they don\u2019t believe in this, they\u2019 ll believe in life. They said, maybe, maybe they are working like we, they are somewhere, they are surround by the soldiers, they can\u2019t send anything. And they -- you know, they think that they are killed, but in the underground they said that they are still alive and they can\u2019t believe that people can kill people. For what? We were in the ghetto another year, and it was all kind of feelings, feelings. A couple of people worked for a plant somewhere. All of a sudden we heard they didn\u2019t return from work. They took them out to the yard and shot them, couple of hundred people. A couple of hundred people worked somewhere in Bilavarka around Wilna, also in turf, and they disappeared, they didn\u2019t return home after work to the ghetto, they were killed. They said they send them to another camp, but no, they were killed. One time it were maybe a -- of -- over two years, or a year and three quarters living in the ghetto, there were rumors that all the people from the -- from the shtetla -- from the towns that surround Wilna were bringing to the Wilna ghetto. And from the Wilna ghetto they are going to Kovno, it was a city in Lithuanian, to build a big plant, a big factory. And people came from the -- you know, from the little towns around Wilna and they looked good, and they were -- were good dressed yet, and they came with all families, with the old and with the sick and with the little children. They were about four and a half thousand people, and they all came to the ghetto. And they made a lot of friends they were study in the school, because our gymnasium was the only one in Poland with the Yiddish language, who had right for coming in after finishing to go to the university. So from all Poland, people used to come to our school. And some of these people from the shtetla were in school, I knew them and they looked well, because you know, in the little shtetla they are [indecipherable] air is good, and th -- and they were for a week in the ghetto, and -- and they were [indecipherable] and we saw that, and after a week they said that the trains are ready and they are going to Kovno to the -- to view the factory. And everybody was going by themself without things. They are going to build a plant. They went to the wagons [indecipherable] with their kids and older people and the -- and the sick and all kind, and when they all get in, they thought that the wagons were [indecipherable] they were closed with not to get out. They said why are they bombing the -- the trains? The wagons that we ge -- we are going by ourself. We are told to go and we are going, why should we be closed? And they were chec -- they were watching, and a lot of people, young people, they know the area. They know how to go to Kovno. And -- and they thought all of a sudden they are going to the forest from Ponar. So it was clear of them that they were not going to by -- but they were -- are going to shot them. Then they broke the windows of the going train, and they start to jump through the windows, whoever could, all over the forest. As soon as the Germans and the Nazi they saw it, they start to shot. And the whole forest was shot with dead people. Very little could run out and survive, very little. Mostly they were shot. And the whole forest were with the dead, shot people. So tomorrow they came to the ghetto and they told the story, the German. And they asks Gens, Gens was in charge of the ghetto, to give him men to clean up the forest. They were afraid to show the other people what they did. So they want the people and they guaranteed Gens. And Gens -- you know who Gens was, yeah, had a big power. So the German.

We don\u2019t know what happened to her, we never saw her again. And we start to run back [indecipherable]. And we were trying to go out, we couldn\u2019t. So we came back from all the attics to the ghetto street, they were empty. The Ukrainian soldiers were liquidated the Wilna ghetto, and we were trying to find another exit and we couldn\u2019t and we don\u2019t know where we are. We are alone, five girls, and don\u2019t know what to see. And then somehow somebody goes through, and this 1s the last of the police, Aryan -- the yard of the Judenrat. So we went to the Judenrat and we [indecipherable] there, and with the last group we went to Rosa where they -- where all the people from the ghetto was there. It was a rainy night and a rainy day and they were sitting on a big place on Rosa, and in the dis, and when we c -- in the dirt, and as soon as we came to the -- to the place, right on the corner I saw my family. My mother and my two sisters with the little child of three years. And my mother saw me, why are you here? And you are here, why did you come? And I was crying and she was crying, I said, where is -- and she told me right there, the men were separate right away, my father and my brother-in-law. I said, and -- and -- and sh -- Luta\u2019s father. And I said, \u201cAnd where is Luta\u2019s mother with her aunt? Why are you not -- not together?\u201d And she said, \u201cLuta\u2019s mother and the aunt are sitting down the hill, a little bit below, not far.\u201d I said, \u201cLuta, come, we\u2019ll go to find your mom, and you\u2019ll bring here, we\u2019|I be all together.\u201d And we went to find Luta\u2019s mom. And we find them, and all of a sudden was an order to go out everybody, and everybody stand up, and we were going, but the people who were in the first place, next to the exit, they were already throw out, and my mother with my sister, with the other sister, with the little three years old child, and they threw them out right away to the left. And we were going through the [indecipherable] so the children were left alone without mothers, and -- and we were going, and Luta\u2019a mother and the aunt was before, and when we came to the exit they pushed them right away to the left, the mother and aunt, and me and Luta [indecipherable] to the right. We came, there were maybe 800- 1800 dollars -- people, or 2000 people, young until 20. No children, nobody. A group on the right side. And the one who were on the left side were taken to Treblinka, Majdanek. And we were taken to Riga to Kaiserwald. Luta will tell you the [indecipherable] about her mother, and that was the last. Another story I forgot to tell you, when only I came to Rosa, to the place where all the people from the liquidation of the ghetto were taken, I saw a little farther a big, tall building. And from the roof of the building were three [indecipherable] like they are going to hang somebody. Three. We said, what\u2019s this? And all of a sudden, three people from the partisan organization of Wilna, the three I was quarreling with them, why are not taking you with us, and he said we are a group people, we are full of weapons, and we can go with a group people. It was a friend of mine, Asia Bik, Janka Kaplan, and Abrashak Voynich, he was a leader of the Bund. And all of a sudden I saw that they went on the [indecipherable] and the [indecipherable] around their head and they were hanged. And the mother of Asia Bik was around, we start to hide in her, not to see. The same day of the liquidation of the ghetto. And all the years I was in the concentration camp, I was thinking, what happened to our old group. Were they all kotched? Why are these kotched, what happened to the other, I didn\u2019t know. When I came back to Wilna after the -- the liberation, I find out that these three people with the weapons, get lost. Instead to go to the left, they went to the right, and they meet a group of Lithuanian and German soldiers and they were looking at them, that they start to shot, and it was a fight and they were kotched and bought on the face of the whole population of the ghetto, they were hanged. This I found out when I returned in 1945 from the concentration camp. And the other people, who went the right way, they survived, mostly survived. A couple were killed during the -- being in the Holocaust, from all kinds of people. And the -- the other people survived then."

A lot of the people who were sent to Riga, to Strassenhof, on the left, a lot of them -- I\u2019Il tell you another story. When we came to Kaiserwald, before we went to Stutthof, they make -- the Germans make lists of the people they who they sent to Strassenhof. They wrote the name and the last name, where they were born, their age and -- I was staying with Luta, she was 15 years old and I was 19. And somehow when the [indecipherable] when they made the list, I was thinking that there were an action in the ghetto where they took the children until 16 years, and they took them away for a camp, but they so -- shot them. And Luta was 15. I said, Luta, we\u2019re describing us the same age. What will happen to you will happen to me. We\u2019ll make us both 18. Iam 18 and you are 18, and we are sisters-in-law. She said why do you want what -- makes o-old? I said, Luta, this is the way I want, and we\u2019re making. And she was 18 and I was 18. After a ye -- not a year, after maybe eight months, all of a sudden they took the whole party from the rooms to the yard and they start to count us. And they count us, I don\u2019t remember how many people. And all of a sudden they called up people before 18 and after 20 -- after 22. If Solanis -- Luta was written her real name, that she\u2019s fo -- 15, in that time she was 16, she was taken out for death. They took them out, and people were very upset. From the room they knocked in the windows, that I am not 20, and I -- you know that -- and they were took aga -- somewhere, and next day all their clothes were brought back to the -- they were all shot. If Luta would describe her real age, she would have been shot. Nothing helped. You couldn\u2019t ask because different people, different soldiers came to pick up this action. And about, I would say two or 300 people were taken away and shot. After a couple of months they took us to Germany, to Stutthof."

            "question": "A barn, mm-hm.",
            "answer": "A barn. And we were in the end of the group, and the soldiers were [indecipherable] fast, go faster, faster, schnella, schnella, schnella. But the people from before didn\u2019t move, and we don\u2019t know what to do, and we were exhausted, we were weak. And they said farther, farther, farther. And we couldn't understand, but finally we get in. What happened, in this barn, this stall was full of people who went [indecipherable] before, and were living there, and lot of them were with frozen legs and backs, it was crowded, and they don\u2019t want to move, they don\u2019t have what to move, and the new people stepped on their stomachs, on their -- on their feet, on their -- and it took a lot of time until we settled on each other. And we couldn\u2019t fall asleep, maybe somehow we fall asleep we didn\u2019t feel it, and in the morning, usually about nine, 10 o\u2019clock, they used to bring us some food. They, not we, we were new. And they saw that nobody bought us anything. Then they opened the yard -- they could burn us, I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t, cause nobody\u2019s around. No sign of kitchen, no sign of food, no sign of -- 0-o-of their soup what they bring. And there were some brave people and it\u2019s -- was far away, the place was called fino. I remember we went through the part and we saw in the little houses it was light, it was nice and we want to go in to see how it\u2019s life. And we were [indecipherable]. And these brave three women went to see what\u2019s doing. And it\u2019s was far away from the road. They went, it was an hour they got back, maybe two, two and a half hour. They came back surround with -- with -- with all kind of clothes, and you know? And they said, we are free. Nobody\u2019s around. I -- we went maybe for a mile, two, and nobody\u2019s around. All that we see, vacance, with food, with clothes left alone and nobody\u2019s there. Then the whole barn, who -- all that could, took their blankets that their clothes were still wet, without hair, and you can\u2019t imagine what it was, and we went all together to the road we went, a mile, two miles. And all of a sudden we saw the sound of tanks, the sound of -- o-of -- of cars, the sound -- and the people like they were going, they went right away to that -- to the tanks where the -- the -- they are going, and they didn\u2019t look at anything, they went in the -- to the road, and they stopped the whole -- the whole procession of the -- of the military. And I was stand up for awhile, and I said, my God, do I look like all the people? And Luta said me -- is very bad. I have a terrible headache. And she was burning like she -- I don\u2019t know how high up temperature went. I am hungry, I want to lay down. And I was stopped for awhile and I look to the crowd at the people. I thought, yes, maybe we were liberated, but it\u2019s too late. We are all crazy. We are not normal people. Sorry. Other people went to the wagon, they find food and start to eat, and they got diarrhea and they were dead right away, after the liberation. And I didn\u2019t look at th-this, any [indecipherable] anything of that because it aren\u2019t interesting, I want a place for Luta to [indecipherable]. And we went to -- to a soldier, an officer, and we ask him, can you put us into a house with my sister very sick? And he said come with us, and another 10 people come with us. I remember this, Luta remembered it a little bit different, but I see it like it was. And we came to a little German house, and an old person, maybe for 90 was along -- around, and the officer, the Russian officer came, \u201cOpen your house and let the people in. What did you do from people? Look what you do -- did to people.\u201d He opened the house, and we went in to a little house, clean, nice, the table was served. I think that the Germans served it for breakfast and they had to run right away. With the beautiful beds, with the nice blankets. Like the country, you know, home. And first of all I put her to the bed, she was burning. And then soldiers came in and a lot of people here and there and this was our liberation. Like a little [indecipherable] first of all we went to have a shower. End of Tape Four Beginning Tape Five"

            "question": "So did you stay at the -- at the house and take care of Luta?",
            "answer": "No. There were more people, she has a good bed, and -- and all of a sudden they came, that the ho -- the hospital that is the same town 1s a hospital and there are lots of sick soldiers, and refugees and there no people to take care of them. And who only could, were go to work there. After a week I went to work, to the hospital for a couple of hours, and I was taking care of Luta, and she was in bed, she was still feeling bad, she was still, but sh-she has a bed. She was in bed, she was -- but she didn\u2019t have any medicine, we didn\u2019t have anything. And I hoped that she\u2019 Il be better and better and better. She\u2019ll get a little better and then [indecipherable]. And after three weeks or a month, the soldiers came and they said that this earth where we are now, has to be given away to Poland or to German or to ru -- and who wants to return to his homeland, from where they came, they have to go to the trains, and they\u2019 Il go back to Lithuania, to Russia. And as we decided with our family, that we'll meet after the war in Wilna, we tried to go to Wilna. Other people were older than we, they wer -- were more -- they thinking a better way. They want to go to the other side, not to ru -- to return to Russia. They know what -- knew what Russia was and I didn\u2019t knew it. I had a good time there in Russia being a kid. So we decide to go to Wilna, maybe we\u2019ll meet somebody from our friends. And we went through Poland, but I heard that all my family perished during the resistant in Warsaw ghetto. And I was mistaken, only my brother- in-law perished. My sister survive, but I didn\u2019t know that. So we went to the wagons to go to Lithuanian. When we came to the border [indecipherable] soldiers came in and said, who doesn\u2019t have any documents have to go out. We were very tired, Luta was sick, and we were going together with the Russian soldiers, with Russian officers. And they said, you know what girls? There in the back are some bags with -- with -- with corn, with some ba -- go behind them. Don\u2019t go out. Where we\u2019ll go again to a center that -- for the people [indecipherable] you will come to Wilna, to your city, you\u2019ll find some friends, and you\u2019ll got your documents. And we listened to that, and we went and we\u2019re hiding. And we didn\u2019t go out to the border, to the centers wer -- were gathered the people without document. And we came to Kovno [indecipherable] we came to Kovno, we went out. And there were Jewish people, they saw us, because they were liberated at -- almost a year ago. 10 year -- 10 months ago. And they saw, oh you came from the camp, from the camp where -- and I remember that some people were working in a bath house, a place where people came to wash themself. And they put us there, and they gave us a room there, and they brought us food, and we wash ourself. We were cleaner because we were in the German house, so we wash ourself, we were cleaner because we were in the German house, so we wash ourself and we changed our clothes, and so we were not so dirty, we almost have a little bit view as -- as people. But still they hair didn\u2019t grow up, for sha -- such a short -- and there we were for maybe a week, and we want to go back to Wilna. We came [indecipherable] rest a little bit whe - and somebody -- somebody from Wilna came, and they gave us a report and they told us about the Shreyber family that they died, and the -- Josef is not alive, my family is not alive. I had a cousin who was alive, but he left already for the United States. And so you go to Wilna. [indecipherable] we came to -- we wanted to go from Kovno to Wilna, what is an hour and a half by train, they didn\u2019t let us. Where is -- are your documents? We said we don\u2019t have documents. Then go back to the border where is the center of the people who doesn\u2019t have document. I said, we will not go. And a couple of days we go into the train and they put us out. We were in and they put us out and they take us to the police and the police said, how did you survive? Did you work with the Germans? And I said, my God, I thought that everybody will be happy that some people survive after so many sufferi -- suffering. And then what should we do, how can we come to Wilna, that it\u2019s so close that we can\u2019t ha -- here we don\u2019t know anybody, there we\u2019 ll find some- some people who came from the partisans, or who were hiding, we\u2019 ll find them. And then we came to the machinist from the train and we ask him bring us to Wilna. We are coming to the train and we are throw out again, we are coming again. Is -- the only thing what we can do for you, sit down in the front where the machinery is, not inside, and this way he\u2019ll [indecipherable] so we didn\u2019t have a choice, me and Luta, and Luta was se-sent in the front, and we came to Wilna. We went out for the -- from the train. We didn't recognize each other, we were from the coal -- from the -- we were da -- dark, w-with all the stuff, with all the dust. And we came to Ponarski Street where Luta used to live, but she -- everybody stranger. We came to a yard, and they came to the f -- second floor. We saw that this was a Jewish family, and we knocked in to the door. And they opened the door, and knocked it back. They saw the people, they get afraid. Knocked at the seven -- a second time. I said, please, you don\u2019t want to let us in, bring us some water and a little soap to wash our faces. We came at the train on the top and we get dirty. We want to clean up ourselves to come to the center of the city. So they took out the bowl of water with the little piece -- so they were not -- they were afraid, they were the Jewish people, but they were not fr -- they didn\u2019t understand the situation. They had the normal life maybe for a year. And maybe they came from Russia, from evacuation. Anyway, they give us the water, and we wash ourselves and we wiped out, and -- a little bit. And we went to the center of the -- li -- Luta came to her yard where she lived, everything was wiped out, her house, and she didn\u2019t find anybody from people she knew. And we went to the center, and there was a librar -- a Jewish library and some offices. And some people came out and they recognized us. And th -- oh [indecipherable] some people take us to their house and we were afraid to come in, we were still so dirty, we -- we didn\u2019t have anything, we didn't have money and we didn\u2019t know the language because Russian we don\u2019t know, we learned a little bit. See, Luta knew, but not me. And she was very sick, she was very sick. And somebody took us to their house, and it was clean, it was nice, it was white, and we didn\u2019t know where to sit down. You know, we were still dirty. And then a friend of mine who li-lived over [indecipherable] has an apartment, three of them, one -- and they said, oh we\u2019ll clean up a little room for you, and you\u2019 ll come, you\u2019ll live with us. And they cleaned up a little room of ours, she gave me a dress, and Luta a dress, we change a little bit. And then I heard a brother of my brother-in-law from my second sister, oh -- he find out that we came, and he took us to his apartment. He took us into his apartment, but Luta was feeling very, very bad. And they find out -- a doctor, not [indecipherable] they came to him and they ask him to look at her and he said she has to go to the hospital. And she went into the hospital, she was for three months in the hospital, and they didn't know what\u2019s wrong with her. And finally they find out that she has an open cover tuberculosis on her -- and she was maybe for a year in a tute - institute. She was 17 at the time. And then, one of her friends, her husband came from the army, and th -- we were on the summer house [indecipherable] with him, or the friend from the family. He was a couple of years older than he, and he fall in love with her, and he was taking care of her very -- I -- very much, even when she was very, very sick. And she was with the tuberculose over a year. Everybody was liberated, I was working, trying to support her. And her - the women who worked with her, who hold her during the ghetto for some times, Vera, also find out that she came, and she helped her. The father\u2019s stories, she will tell her -- you.
