They came, with some exceptions, from the east, from -- from the region between Poland and Germany. And on both sides, the Lachmann and the Mosse side, the -- towards 1860, the sons emigrated to Berlin. It was common, too, Berlin was becoming the center, yes? And there they founded a business, I mean a business [indecipherable] my grandfather on the Lachmann side, to start with that first.

And he was offered nobility, which was very rare for a Jew. But he refused it. Like my other grandfather refused it too. These people were good liberals, the aristocracy was not -- was not something they desired. So, and then the grandfathers were the great thing, and then my father was his grandson, of this Salomon Lachmann, who was the notable grain dealer, and so on, yes. And on the other side, as of course become more famous through the years, because my grandfather Mosse, who came from a small village in Posen, called Greiz, came to Berlin, and went into the -- went into the advertising, so to speak, yes, what was then 1850\u2019s. And in the 1860\u2019s he had the idea of having an advertising agency where you could advertise not just for one paper, but for all papers. That was quite new something then, yes. And that\u2019s what was the basis of what came after, for what came after was in 1867, the founding of the Berliner Tageblatt which -- and then other newspapers publishing the address book for Germany, yes, and the matters of this nature. And this publishing empire, you could really call it, he found it on the business of the advertising. that was the basis. And he had no children, only my mother. So my father married into the business, and when my grandfather died in 1920, he became the head of this business."

            "answer": "That was a very famous German school, one of the most famous boarding schools in Germany. My father had a -- a friend, a friend -- or friend 1s said too much, a companion, when he grew up in his high school gymnasium, yes, called Kurt Hahn. And Kurt Hahn 1s a fascinating character in his own right. Kurt Hahn was -- became secretary to the Prince of Baden, who became chancellor -- interim chancellor. And after the first World War, in the castle of the prince, he founded a boarding school, on the English model, on the English model, which became a boarding school si -- it\u2019s difficult to say. It became a boarding school -- it\u2019s -- I mean, it\u2019s not difficult to say, it\u2019s just I have to find the right words. It became a boarding school for the aristocracy, yes. For example, the Duke of Edinburgh went there, yeah. The queen of Greece. I used to dunk her pigtails into ink. I mean, the late queen of Greece, yes. Didn\u2019t like her very much as a child. And all sorts of yes, royalty, and rich families, but also poor. But it\u2019s typical of the atmosphere of the school that the free places, or scholarship places were reserved for sons and daughters of generals of the first World War, yeah. Or people, officers who\u2019d fallen in the first World War, something like that, yes. I think that was very typical, though the plus of the school was that it was one of a very few, I think the only German boarding school that was co- educational. And that was not on the English model, and that was a great plus, yes. But otherwise, it\u2019s very strict discipline, as you can well imagine, yes. And I don\u2019t think the teaching was very good, I don\u2019t think you learned a lot, but your character was built."

I did very well indeed in the two boarding schools I went to, \u2018cause eventually I went to an English boarding school, of course, when Hitler came in.

And it\u2019s children among themselves, especially young teenagers can be very brutal. But all this was controlled by a discipline which I now think, looking back on it, was really excellent and doesn\u2019t exist in this country at all. For example, from -- from the age of 10 on, yes -- I left it when I was 15, but it existed \u2018til the age of 18, you got something called -- if you were especially good -- this was a privilege, you got a training plan, which was a plan on which there was written, have you brushed your teeth, have you done your run in the morning, have you had your cold shower, yes? You know? Have you cheated today, and so on. And you put a plus and minus whether you did it or not. And nobody cheated. Was a privilege, nobody cheated. And that -- that, I think, makes up for all the deficiencies of the school."

            "num": 21,
            "question": "Why do you think that was so, that nobody cheated?",
            "answer": "\u2014 It was just in the atmosphere, it was a privilege, it wouldn\u2019t have occurred to anybody to cheat. It was not done. The best way of putting it: 1t was simply not done. And that sort of training is totally absent in American education, unfortunately."

I mean, for example, one day Litvinov, the -- the -- the Russian, first foreign minister, the Bolsheviks, came -- came to the house, a party or something, and I was allowed to go into the drawing room downstairs, which as a rule I was not, of course, yes?

And I stood in front of him, I\u2019m told, and pointed at him, to the great embarrassment of everybody, and said, \u201cA Bolshevik? How come he\u2019s dressed that way?\u201d Yes, mostly cause my father, who was not very apt at business, but who had great cultural interests, above all music, mostly musicians came into our house. Every Christmas -- you see, part of the daily rhythm was vacations in those days, and the vacations were normed. In other words, every winter we went skiing, regardless, every winter. Usually to Saint Moritz, yes, and later on to Arosa, but every winter we went skiing, and every summer we had a house in the Alps. So, this was the rhythm. But the Christmases, for example, we always spent with a -- the most famous German conductor, I suppose, almost, of the century, called Fuertwangler. With the Fuertwanglers we spent the Christmas. He didn\u2019t behave very well after 1933, that\u2019s another story. But we spent Christmas at Fuertwanglers. And there were always people from the musical world, and sometimes from the theater world, who came to the house, but I was too young, I wasn\u2019t allowed to be present, you know."

Rubinstein played and all sorts of people played, because my father was a Hubermann above all, my father gave the first violin to Hubermann. So, Hubermann played and so on, yes, yes, mm-hm.

And I became a prefect, so I could tyrannize the other kids, and they couldn\u2019t tyrannize me. So that was a good -- a good thing, yes. So, no, I didn\u2019t. It was never directed against me.

            "answer": "Well, at -- first of all I was last because I was bad, generally, and I had to do -- what do you call it, after school, what do you call it if you have to stay after school, yeah? I had to stay after school, and my parents and everybody was out. And Hitler made a decree that I think -- I -- I always get that wrong, but let\u2019s say towards the first of February or something, you -- not the first of February, the 12 of February, you had to have a permit to leave Germany, yes. That was unprecedented, that never been before, yes. And I wouldn\u2019t have gotten it, because the Nazis would have taken me hostage for the family, and the newspapers, and everything, yes. So my parents pleaded, but the headmistress of my pre-school -- I was, of course, in pre-school--who was a real Protestant type, a Vermont Protestant type, but a real Prussian Protestant type, said no, that I must stay till I have finished my duty after school, you see. So, the result of that is -- no, I mean she was a wonderful woman, she got into \u2014 Fraeulein Koeppen was her name, she got into prison eventually because she refused to teach \u201cMein Kampf\u2019, but she refused to teach \u201cMein Kampf\u201d in German class, because it was bad German, not because we -- you know, it was bad German. It is bad German, yeah, so she was a real -- as you call it, a real -- you know, a real type, as it were. So I was late, and the way to leave was via the ferry across Lake Constance, \u2018cause that\u2019s near where the school was. So I came to the ferry, and that was the last ferry before this so-called \u201csichtvermerk,\u201d this permit -- the exit permit, yeah. And there were nothing but Brown Shirts on either side, yes. And when you had to run through them, as it were, yes. And -- and it was my luck that just before Hitler had mentioned us, in some way. Mosse, Jew press, you know, and so on. So I came there, and I said, well, I\u2019m done for, because all they did 1s hel -- hold me back five minutes and the ferry would be gone and they had me.

            "answer": "Well, the political orientation of most Jews, German Jews, most Jews in Europe, was a liberal orientation, because they were emancipated in the enlightenment. That had given them the chance of emancipation, to become part of the community as it were. And this chance they used, and what remained of it was a belief, let us say in -- in -- in processes, not in finished thing -- in other words, in Germany -- there\u2019s one other factor perhaps I should explain. There is the word \u201cBildung\u201d, which means -- it\u2019s a German word, essentially European word, which means cultivate your character, cultivate yourself. And the assimilation of Jews was facilitated by the idea that everybody could cultivate his own nature, his own character, yes. Didn\u2019t matter were you Jews and Christians, because this was a process. This was not a finished product, like nation or anything else: this was a process. Now, this fitted the whole Jewish situation obviously, because that was their way to integration, yes? So that you will find, for example in Germany, yeah, that the Jews supported the small liberal party, which was tiny by 1933, yes, our newspapers, the other Jewish owned newspapers, yes. Which meant most of the serious press supported the tiny liberal party, when it obviously had no chance. And of course, as in a way the fate of the Jews depended not only on tolerance, but also on freedom, economic freedom, and so on, yes. They didn\u2019t see -- my father, for example, not at all-- what was obvious, that by the 1920\u2019s, the social democrats were the great champions of the Jews in Germany, yes. But they didn\u2019t see it, they still saw the social democratic Marxist rhetoric as an enemy, yes. So I remember when my sister first voted social democratic. That was terrible row in the house, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And my mother immediately began with the toothbrush, \u201cdo you want to share your toothbrush? That was her reaction to everything on socialist, you see. It was terrible, though. Illegitimate children were also mentioned, and God knows why. I mean, today it seems ridiculous, but that\u2019s how social democrats were perceived, though they were the real champions of the Jews, not the liberals, not the political liberals in Germany, that -- you know. But they will remain liberals to the very end, that is the German Jewish tradition, and it\u2019s a very fine tradition. In a way you can put it this way, that it were the German Jews who carried the liberal tradition from 1933 through to 1945. Who transmitted it."

For example, whenever I went to Switzerland to see my sister or brother, I had to -- my father, I -- my father had to deposit a very large sum, to be sure I went out again. Do you know? The Swiss were the worst, that\u2019s not generally realized. The \u201cJ\u201d for Jew in your passport, that was a Swiss, not a Nazi idea at all.

And the next episode that I remember vividly is that Goering called my father back, and he said, \u201cT want to talk to you, and if you don\u2019t come back, we\u2019ll take your mother.\u201d And so -- his sisters were still there, yes, hostage. So my father, who must have been a very courageous man -- well, he fought in the first World War-- I guess, went onto the train to Berlin, to Goering. And nobody knows what really transpired, but there is a secret history here, which has never been really scru - it\u2019s never been investigated by scholars, how many Jews were Aryanized. \u2018Cause my f -- Goering offered my father Aryanization. There were others, some very famous, the German chief of the Luftwaffe, General Milch was Aryanized. Now why he did this is a general dispute. Either- | don\u2019t think it\u2019s cause he wanted to use the advertising agencies as spy places, he had enough spy places. Maybe he wanted respectability, and he would have -- you know, he would have had him maybe for a year, and then, yo -- you know, to Dachau, or something else, yeah? I have no idea. Anyway, my father refused, and was escorted back on the train by the chief -- then chief of the German secret police, a man called Bergmann, the first chief of the Nazi secret police. And we think he should have been murdered on the train, but he wasn\u2019t. And Bergmann wrote his memoirs where he also talks about this, and he came back. So that was the next episode. And that, of course, I remember, yeah, cause there were some anxieties, you can imagine, yes? But then it must be said that in these early days, the Nazis asked other people to come back. For example, the - our chief editor, Theo DeWolfe, who was a [indecipherable] man, has a correspondence, and Goebbels asked him to come back. They wanted respectability for a period.

So I had my sister here, I visit her, but that didn\u2019t solve my problem, because August, you know, school starts in September, what am I going to do? So what I did was fairly simple. Bootham was a Quaker school. I knew nothing about America, believe me, nothing. But I knew there was a Quaker city called Philadelphia. So I looked up the trains and I just had enough money to come to Philadelphia, that was all. We were very poor, there was no money. I just had no money. And in Philadelphia I went and got myself a taxi and said, \u201cDrive me to the first Quaker institution.\u201d Which he did, which was Friends Select School.

Haverford and Swarthmore.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cWhere does the train go first?\u201d The train went first to Haverford. So I got off at Haverford station, walked to the college, saw the president, William Wistar Comfort. And said, \u201cI\u2019m an old Bootham boy here am I stranded,\u201d you know, \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d I was hungry.
