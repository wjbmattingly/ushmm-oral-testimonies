That is to say my grandfather Mosse founded the newspaper, business of newspaper advertising, and my father married into it, and then took my mother\u2019s name. So it\u2019s Lachmann Mosse, really. But when I came to America, I abbreviated the Lachmann to an L, and took Mosse, \u2018cause I thought that was more comprehensible."

            "answer": "Don\u2019t quite know how to characterize it. It\u2019s a very typical German Jewish story. They came, with some exceptions, from the east, from -- from the region between Poland and Germany. And on both sides, the Lachmann and the Mosse side, the -- towards 1860, the sons emigrated to Berlin. It was common, too, Berlin was becoming the center, yes? And there they founded a business, I mean a business [indecipherable] my grandfather on the Lachmann side, to start with that first. My grandfather Lachmann side was a very notable grain dealer, yes, who played some role in German history, in fact, because in the Franco-Prussian war, the army -- nobody knew where the French army was that you wanted to fight, and as a grain dealer, he became sort of the, how would you say, the intelligence man for Bismarck, and the German army, yes? And he was offered nobility, which was very rare for a Jew. But he refused it. Like my other grandfather refused it too. These people were good liberals, the aristocracy was not -- was not something they desired. So, and then the grandfathers were the great thing, and then my father was his grandson, of this Salomon Lachmann, who was the notable grain dealer, and so on, yes. And on the other side, as of course become more famous through the years, because my grandfather Mosse, who came from a small village in Posen, called Greiz, came to Berlin, and went into the -- went into the advertising, so to speak, yes, what was then 1850\u2019s. And in the 1860\u2019s he had the idea of having an advertising agency where you could advertise not just for one paper, but for all papers. That was quite new something then, yes. And that\u2019s what was the basis of what came after, for what came after was in 1867, the founding of the Berliner Tageblatt which -- and then other newspapers publishing the address book for Germany, yes, and the matters of this nature. And this publishing empire, you could really call it, he found it on the business of the advertising. that was the basis. And he had no children, only my mother. So my father married into the business, and when my grandfather died in 1920, he became the head of this business."

            "answer": "Well, I grew up in a luxury that I suppose seemed normal to me then, but today seems to me entirely un-normal, yes? We had a house in L, and an estate in ...-- about 45 minutes from Berlin, yes. And other estates, but that\u2019s the important one: 45 minutes from Berlin. And I spent my time between these two, Berlin and the estate, yes, until I went to boarding school. And in these -- in the -- in the house in Berlin and in the estates, of course, there were servants, usually a couple, butler and cook, you know, kitchen maid. My father once in our Berlin house, met a girl on the stairs and said, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She said, \u201cI am the kitchen maid.\u201d Of course, he didn\u2019t know who these people were. And -- you know, and other kinds of maids, yes. And then, of course, as children, we [indecipherable] had governesses. First we had a nursemaid, and then we had governesses, and the governess were chosen by language. My first governesses were all French, French ladies. They didn\u2019t last long with me, \u2018cause I was very naughty. But they were French ladies, and then came an English lady. So I learned French first, and English then."

Until I was fairly old I thought French was -- France was giv -- governed by kings, because of these ladies I had, yes. So yes, it was a luxury. I had my own car and driver.

            "question": "And where did you go?",
            "answer": "That was a very famous German school, one of the most famous boarding schools in Germany. My father had a -- a friend, a friend -- or friend 1s said too much, a companion, when he grew up in his high school gymnasium, yes, called Kurt Hahn. And Kurt Hahn 1s a fascinating character in his own right. Kurt Hahn was -- became secretary to the Prince of Baden, who became chancellor -- interim chancellor. And after the first World War, in the castle of the prince, he founded a boarding school, on the English model, on the English model, which became a boarding school si -- it\u2019s difficult to say. It became a boarding school -- it\u2019s -- I mean, it\u2019s not difficult to say, it\u2019s just I have to find the right words. It became a boarding school for the aristocracy, yes. For example, the Duke of Edinburgh went there, yeah. The queen of Greece. I used to dunk her pigtails into ink. I mean, the late queen of Greece, yes. Didn\u2019t like her very much as a child. And all sorts of yes, royalty, and rich families, but also poor. But it\u2019s typical of the atmosphere of the school that the free places, or scholarship places were reserved for sons and daughters of generals of the first World War, yeah. Or people, officers who\u2019d fallen in the first World War, something like that, yes. I think that was very typical, though the plus of the school was that it was one of a very few, I think the only German boarding school that was co- educational. And that was not on the English model, and that was a great plus, yes. But otherwise, it\u2019s very strict discipline, as you can well imagine, yes. And I don\u2019t think the teaching was very good, I don\u2019t think you learned a lot, but your character was built."

I did very well indeed in the two boarding schools I went to, \u2018cause eventually I went to an English boarding school, of course, when Hitler came in."

And it\u2019s children among themselves, especially young teenagers can be very brutal. But all this was controlled by a discipline which I now think, looking back on it, was really excellent and doesn\u2019t exist in this country at all. For example, from -- from the age of 10 on, yes -- I left it when I was 15, but it existed \u2018til the age of 18, you got something called -- if you were especially good -- this was a privilege, you got a training plan, which was a plan on which there was written, have you brushed your teeth, have you done your run in the morning, have you had your cold shower, yes? You know? Have you cheated today, and so on. And you put a plus and minus whether you did it or not. And nobody cheated. Was a privilege, nobody cheated. And that -- that, I think, makes up for all the deficiencies of the school."

            "num": 21,
            "question": "Why do you think that was so, that nobody cheated?",
            "answer": "\u2014 It was just in the atmosphere, it was a privilege, it wouldn\u2019t have occurred to anybody to cheat. It was not done. The best way of putting it: 1t was simply not done. And that sort of training is totally absent in American education, unfortunately."

            "answer": "Well, you met interesting people. Of course I was much too young to notice interesting people, yes? I mean, for example, one day Litvinov, the -- the -- the Russian, first foreign minister, the Bolsheviks, came -- came to the house, a party or something, and I was allowed to go into the drawing room downstairs, which as a rule I was not, of course, yes? And he had on a what you call it, formal dress, yes? And I stood in front of him, I\u2019m told, and pointed at him, to the great embarrassment of everybody, and said, \u201cA Bolshevik? How come he\u2019s dressed that way?\u201d Yes, mostly cause my father, who was not very apt at business, but who had great cultural interests, above all music, mostly musicians came into our house. Every Christmas -- you see, part of the daily rhythm was vacations in those days, and the vacations were normed. In other words, every winter we went skiing, regardless, every winter. Usually to Saint Moritz, yes, and later on to Arosa, but every winter we went skiing, and every summer we had a house in the Alps. So, this was the rhythm. But the Christmases, for example, we always spent with a -- the most famous German conductor, I suppose, almost, of the century, called Fuertwangler. With the Fuertwanglers we spent the Christmas. He didn\u2019t behave very well after 1933, that\u2019s another story. But we spent Christmas at Fuertwanglers. And there were always people from the musical world, and sometimes from the theater world, who came to the house, but I was too young, I wasn\u2019t allowed to be present, you know."

Rubinstein played and all sorts of people played, because my father was a Hubermann above all, my father gave the first violin to Hubermann. So, Hubermann played and so on, yes, yes, mm-hm. Very, very musical household, but there were also other things. My grandmother founded, for example, what we would call in Berlin, homes for wayward girls, yes. And this became a society [indecipherable] society women. Every woman adopted one of these homes for wayward girls. And my mother was the president of it. So they met, of course, in the house, these society women, and the home for wayward girls. I don\u2019t know what they mean by wayward girls, to this day I can\u2019t tell you.

Now Jewish reform in Germany was a complete reform, much more than anything you know about today, yes. And they were very involved with it indeed, yes. Both, my grandfather Mosse, and my father.

He put me into a car, into our car, and a -- said to the chauffeur to drive to the Scheunenviertel, that\u2019s the Jewish quarter of Berlin, yes. And there he took me and said -- and showed me these pious Jews, you know, with the peyes, and dark, you know.

My generation isn\u2019t like other generations, especially today. We were always politicized. My first memories are political memories. The first thing I remember from childhood are political memories. For example, my mother taking me to a soup kitchen for the unemployed, which she ran, yes, yeah. For example, leaning out of the window one day and there were no lights on in the square, what\u2019s happened? President Ebert died, the president of the republic.

They didn\u2019t dare carry it in the school, but in the neighboring town. Of course, the gymnastics teacher, you know, in uniform. We knew that, yes. And swastikas were burned on the hills around the school, that I remember, too, yes. And indeed, things were already so relatively tight, that when you went to take the train to school, 1t was quite -- it was a long train ride, seven -- six, seven hours, something like, yeah, you were given something that the Jewish defense organization put up -- put -- put out, called the Anti-Anti, that 1s the name. And it was a kind of folder, yes, where you looked through. And if somebody said to you, the Jews are bad, you looked through, and you said, \u201cBut there\u2019s Einstein.\u201d Things like that. It\u2019s a wonderful document because it shows how the Jews tried to combat anti-Semitism rationally, yes, \u2018cause this folder was divided into parts, yes.

And I became a prefect, so I could tyrannize the other kids, and they couldn\u2019t tyrannize me. So that was a good -- a good thing, yes. So, no, I didn\u2019t. It was never directed against me. For some reason I can just tell you how I saw it, or I experienced it. I never really experienced anti- Semitism.

I had to stay after school, and my parents and everybody was out. And Hitler made a decree that I think -- I -- I always get that wrong, but let\u2019s say towards the first of February or something, you -- not the first of February, the 12 of February, you had to have a permit to leave Germany, yes. That was unprecedented, that never been before, yes. And I wouldn\u2019t have gotten it, because the Nazis would have taken me hostage for the family, and the newspapers, and everything, yes. So my parents pleaded, but the headmistress of my pre-school -- I was, of course, in pre-school--who was a real Protestant type, a Vermont Protestant type, but a real Prussian Protestant type, said no, that I must stay till I have finished my duty after school, you see. So, the result of that is -- no, I mean she was a wonderful woman, she got into \u2014 Fraeulein Koeppen was her name, she got into prison eventually because she refused to teach \u201cMein Kampf\u2019, but she refused to teach \u201cMein Kampf\u201d in German class, because it was bad German, not because we -- you know, it was bad German. It is bad German, yeah, so she was a real -- as you call it, a real -- you know, a real type, as it were. So I was late, and the way to leave was via the ferry across Lake Constance, \u2018cause that\u2019s near where the school was. So I came to the ferry, and that was the last ferry before this so-called \u201csichtvermerk,\u201d this permit -- the exit permit, yeah. And there were nothing but Brown Shirts on either side, yes. And when you had to run through them, as it were, yes. And -- and it was my luck that just before Hitler had mentioned us, in some way. Mosse, Jew press, you know, and so on. So I came there, and I said, well, I\u2019m done for, because all they did 1s hel -- hold me back five minutes and the ferry would be gone and they had me. And indeed, when I showed my passport, they looked at each other and passed it from one SA man to another. They didn\u2019t stop me. That\u2019s Germany. It was five minute to 12, not 12. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m here today, yes. Yeah."

            "answer": "Well, the political orientation of most Jews, German Jews, most Jews in Europe, was a liberal orientation, because they were emancipated in the enlightenment. That had given them the chance of emancipation, to become part of the community as it were. And this chance they used, and what remained of it was a belief, let us say in -- in -- in processes, not in finished thing -- in other words, in Germany -- there\u2019s one other factor perhaps I should explain. There is the word \u201cBildung\u201d, which means -- it\u2019s a German word, essentially European word, which means cultivate your character, cultivate yourself. And the assimilation of Jews was facilitated by the idea that everybody could cultivate his own nature, his own character, yes. Didn\u2019t matter were you Jews and Christians, because this was a process. This was not a finished product, like nation or anything else: this was a process. Now, this fitted the whole Jewish situation obviously, because that was their way to integration, yes? So that you will find, for example in Germany, yeah, that the Jews supported the small liberal party, which was tiny by 1933, yes, our newspapers, the other Jewish owned newspapers, yes. Which meant most of the serious press supported the tiny liberal party, when it obviously had no chance. And of course, as in a way the fate of the Jews depended not only on tolerance, but also on freedom, economic freedom, and so on, yes. They didn\u2019t see -- my father, for example, not at all-- what was obvious, that by the 1920\u2019s, the social democrats were the great champions of the Jews in Germany, yes. But they didn\u2019t see it, they still saw the social democratic Marxist rhetoric as an enemy, yes. So I remember when my sister first voted social democratic. That was terrible row in the house, terrible row. And my mother immediately began with the toothbrush, \u201cdo you want to share your toothbrush? That was her reaction to everything on socialist, you see. It was terrible, though. Illegitimate children were also mentioned, and God knows why. I mean, today it seems ridiculous, but that\u2019s how social democrats were perceived, though they were the real champions of the Jews, not the liberals, not the political liberals in Germany, that -- you know. But they will remain liberals to the very end, that is the German Jewish tradition, and it\u2019s a very fine tradition. In a way you can put it this way, that it were the German Jews who carried the liberal tradition from 1933 through to 1945. Who transmitted it."

And told my father, for example, that working class children already came to -- came to the meetings with little Nazi daggers in their belt, my father should take Hitler seriously.

But everything wa -- became a hassle, because in the first list of si -- of people who lost their citizenship, we were in that first list, including me, all of 15. So having no citizenship in the modern world was a terrible fate. So everything became a problem. Everything, yes.

So that wasn\u2019t a big change, yes. You had to do that everywhere. For example, whenever I went to Switzerland to see my sister or brother, I had to -- my father, I -- my father had to deposit a very large sum, to be sure I went out again. Do you know? The Swiss were the worst, that\u2019s not generally realized. The \u201cJ\u201d for Jew in your passport, that was a Swiss, not a Nazi idea at all. It was a Swiss idea, so they could keep Jews out, yeah. That isn\u2019t enough -- emphasized enough, yes. So I didn\u2019t -- so then we all got different passports, of course. My sister, because it was very -- she knew how to do things, went- there was one consul in Naples, Reitling was his name, who gave Jews passports without a \u2018J\u2019. And she got one. And th -- almost the same thing happened to me, I went in London to get a new passport without a \u201cJ\u201d, you know, and the consular official talked to me and shoved me over surreptitiously, a passport without a \u201cJ\u201d. You see, there were decent people around, yes. So for awhile I had a passport, then my brother became a Turk for awhile because we had very good Turkish connections, yes. And then this German passport expired in a very short time, and my father got the Prime Minister of Luxemburg to forge his own passport, which I still have, for me, yes, without expiry date, so I traveled for about three years on a Luxemburgian passport, which was embarrassing when I met somebody from Luxemburg because I\u2019d never been there, of course, in my life. And today I keep it in case the Americans are cheeky, I say, me, a Luxemburgian, you know. And what I learned from that is you can never have enough passports, believe me, you can never have enough passports."

Every time he con -- conquered a country, a business went out, you see, yeah. So it must have been difficult, I wasn\u2019t in -- you know, in the loop that I could say what the discussion was about finances. But it was certainly difficult. I would say that when I remember -- also I should add that is, yes, I remember when we left in \u201933, we first went to Zurich, to a hotel, yeah, and that I remember visit -- vividly, cause that hotel was full of \u00e9migr\u00e9s, sudden \u00e9migre\u00e9s. It just happened, just happened. Emigr\u00e9s who were quite famous. The literary critic of our paper, for example, Kerr was there, and all sorts of people. And the whole thing I always thought, even then, must have been like the refugees from the French revolution sort of atmosphere, yes. But I lost it cause I was bitten by my dog -- by a dog then, the first time I was ever bitten by a dog. But nevermind, it had nothing to do with the greater events. So anyway, that I remember vividly. And the next episode that I remember vividly is that Goering called my father back, and he said, \u201cT want to talk to you, and if you don\u2019t come back, we\u2019ll take your mother.\u201d And so -- his sisters were still there, yes, hostage. So my father, who must have been a very courageous man -- well, he fought in the first World War-- I guess, went onto the train to Berlin, to Goering. And nobody knows what really transpired, but there is a secret history here, which has never been really scru - it\u2019s never been investigated by scholars, how many Jews were Aryanized. \u2018Cause my f -- Goering offered my father Aryanization. There were others, some very famous, the German chief of the Luftwaffe, General Milch was Aryanized. Now why he did this is a general dispute. Either- | don\u2019t think it\u2019s cause he wanted to use the advertising agencies as spy places, he had enough spy places. Maybe he wanted respectability, and he would have -- you know, he would have had him maybe for a year, and then, yo -- you know, to Dachau, or something else, yeah? I have no idea. Anyway, my father refused, and was escorted back on the train by the chief -- then chief of the German secret police, a man called Bergmann, the first chief of the Nazi secret police. And we think he should have been murdered on the train, but he wasn\u2019t. And Bergmann wrote his memoirs where he also talks about this, and he came back. So that was the next episode. And that, of course, I remember, yeah, cause there were some anxieties, you can imagine, yes? But then it must be said that in these early days, the Nazis asked other people to come back. For example, the - our chief editor, Theo DeWolfe, who was a [indecipherable] man, has a correspondence, and Goebbels asked him to come back. They wanted respectability for a period. I think that\u2019s really the explanation."

But you see, my sister would have met me, my sister came first in 19 thir -- \u00b036. And as my mother said, \u201cYou are giving us to the bombs.\u201d You see? But she, of course, had good sense, she came [indecipherable] and she was in residence Schenectady, New York. Schenectady, New York was my first reference point in America. She was a resident of Schenectady in New York, yes. And I came to New York, and then my stepmother arrived, yes. And I hired an apartment for us, terrible apartment for us, yes. And my father was caught in France with my stepbrother, my stepmother\u2019s son, yes. And he came out only with great difficulty, but he came out, too, eventually. And my mother came out through the occupied zone of France, from Switzerland, that you could do, and my brother came out that way. But my sister was the first, yes. So I had my sister here, I visit her, but that didn\u2019t solve my problem, because August, you know, school starts in September, what am I going to do? So what I did was fairly simple. Bootham was a Quaker school. I knew nothing about America, believe me, nothing. But I knew there was a Quaker city called Philadelphia. So I looked up the trains and I just had enough money to come to Philadelphia, that was all. We were very poor, there was no money. I just had no money. And in Philadelphia I went and got myself a taxi and said, \u201cDrive me to the first Quaker institution.\u201d Which he did, which was Friends Select School. So I went in and said, \u201cI want to see the headmaster,\u201d and I said to the headmaster, \u201cI\u2019m an old Bootham boy, I have no money, first you must pay the taxi.\u201d Which he did. Then I said, \u201cNow it\u2019s September, what am I going to do?\u201d He said, \u201cWe have two colleges, the Quakers. Haverford and Swarthmore.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cWhere does the train go first?\u201d The train went first to Haverford. So I got off at Haverford station, walked to the college, saw the president, William Wistar Comfort. And said, \u201cI\u2019m an old Bootham boy here am I stranded,\u201d you know, \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d I was hungry. And he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll take thee.\u201d Now, I don\u2019t know, I was the first Jew ever accepted at Haverford I think. Yes, I\u2019m sure, yes, and 1t was very exclusive mainline college in those days, very, yes. So I went to Haverford. A lucky choice, because in those days small colleges could afford great scholars, and Haverford had great scholars. Was very good."

And that came about because really very little else was taught to begin with 1-in -- in school, in any case. And I -- through Leslie Gilbert and others, I had become deeply involved in English history. So that\u2019s why.

And of course, Italian nationalism was kind of a -- always had a revolutionary edge to it, th -- one that Mussolini adopted, yes. While in Germany, you have a much more dense space, romanticism, racism; racism unknown in Italy, there\u2019s no racist tradition. Italy hardly has an anti-Semitic tradition. So that deprives it, already, of a lot of things that you associate with the Nazis, yes. But a lot of things are the same, the control of thought -- well, there\u2019s another great difference. Mussolini didn\u2019t care about culture. You could have the most -- after all, the most modernist buildings in Europe were built under fascism. Like the House of Fascism in Modena, probably the most modernist building in Europe of it\u2019s time, yes. There was no -- no official art in Italy till very late. It did come, but very late, yes. All of that. There was no -- so severe book censorship as in Germany. In other words, the culture, which didn\u2019t interest Mussoli -- Mussolini, or did interest him, but he had a more open -- he was quite a different person, he had a more open mind on this, yes.

For example, I made a big meeting, as chairman, anti-McCarthyite meeting, overtly, with the finance chairman of the Republican party of Iowa as the main speaker. You see, for him McCarthy was the radical, yes.

One is women in the Holocaust, yes. Homosexuals, that area\u2019s being repaired now. An excellent book by Gauss and so on, that\u2019s being repaired. Gypsies is being repaired, yes. But look how long it 1s after the Holocaust, how long it took, yes. I mean, that\u2019s the astonishing thing, yes. And -- and still, I don\u2019t think there is enough about the victims, oddly enough. What they felt, what they thought. We know a lot about the perpetrators, but a -- again, not enough, because Holocaust scholars have been either historians or English professors. If they\u2019re English professors, they go in for the literary. If they\u2019re historians, they go in for the instrumental. But what about the mindset of these people, yes?
