            "answer": "Wow. It was a very strange way that -- that I got married, to begin with, and I don\u2019t remember how much time I had to talk about that. But I mentioned at that time that I met my husband a year before, and we met on the train. All that was there, I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079 \u00b0 think. And so I haven\u2019t actually seen him prior to that, for a whole year. Prior to the wedding, I mean. For a whole year. He came two weeks before our wedding. And I had never in my life seen a Jewish wedding, and I have never -- so I really didn't know exactly what was going to happen. And very differently from weddings that I\u2019m witnessing now, including my sons. It never even occurred to me to think about arranging for anything or thinking about anything except my dress. That was about the only thing I thought about. And everything else I sort of just let be. It\u2019s like somebody -- was somebody else\u2019s thing to do it, a sort of -- sort of like I was going to a party, and my col -- main -- my -- my main concern was to think about, you know, Dan\u2019s coming and how 1s that going to be? Am I st -- am I truly, really in love or am I just making things up? Am I just bored in Switzerland, or unhappy in Switzerland or lonely? Because, of course, I had come there only -- less than a year before and I'd left all my friends behind in -- in Croatia and Yugoslavia. Had a boyfriend whom I, you know, forgot the minute I got on the train. Obviously it wasn\u2019t a very serious thing. And I lived a totally, totally different life in Switzerland than I had ever thought I would live. I mean, not only did I not know about Jewish weddings, I didn\u2019t know anything about Jewish period. And you know, I knew very little on -- my experience was one month in Switzerland before that, and I -- you know, a few years before that. So everything was sort of going to [indecipherable] plus I was going to meet my aunt and uncle, who were coming in from Switzerland - from -- I\u2019m sorry, from Israel, and I had never seen them as a adult.

            "answer": "That\u2019s my father\u2019s brother and my father\u2019s sister, both of whom decided to come in for my wedding. And so there were so many different things. I mean, I have -- I-I have -- I had very little -- almost no contact with them. My aunt, of course, I didn't even see a -- at all after the war. I only had pictures, I knew she existed. My father\u2019s sister."

            "question": "Can you say their names?",
            "answer": "Lina. That was Lina who married a wi -- a Weesler, and I knew that she had two children and I had the -- I had the daughter\u2019s photograph with me when I was living in -- in Yugoslavia. Her photograph was left because was -- had been sent to my maternal grandparents, must be. I don\u2019t know how I got that photograph. And it was she as a child, and it\u2019s a beautiful little girl with -- and she\u2019s holding a gorgeous doll. And I had that after the war. And it was sort of like all -- like looking at Shirley Temple, like a movie star or something, because we didn\u2019t have such dolls or such clothes or such anything. So that was -- that -- that was my only image of -- of this aunt with this daughter, my dau -- my cousin Dina who now lives in Israel. And her - her -- she had a brother, Rubin, whom -- whose picture I did not have and I -- he also now lives in Israel and of course, we now we know -- know each other. So -- so my aunt was coming. And then my uncle was coming, whom I last saw, I think as a seven or eight year old in Yugoslavia, because he came back from the prisoner of war camps -- camp. He was in Germany during the war. He was in the Yugoslav USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079 \u00b0 army when the war started and so he -- he was -- he survived as a prisoner of war, he came back. He married a woman he met there in Yugoslavia, I think he may have known her from before. She and her three sisters had all together survived Auschwitz. Oh, it\u2019s a unbelievable story which I can\u2019t get her to talk about on tape, which I wish I could. They now live in Israel. But at that time he came -- he came, he found me in Ludbreg where I was living during the war, and he -- I remember that he -- he tried to talk to me about going with him, and I refused to go. I remem -- sort of remember that conversation. I -- I -- I had that memory, and of course he left me a picture, which I have, which you know, beautiful handwriting says, this is a -- in memor -- to remember him by. And he\u2019s wearing his army uniform. So, all of a sudden this aunt and uncle were going to come to the wedding. So that was going to be that. And of course my m -- my future mother-in-law was coming with my husband on the boat. And her brother, who is -- who survived the war -- actually th - my husband\u2019s family left -- left Russia actually mol -- Moldavia -- Moldova in the early 1900\u2019s, but this brother went to -- to France rather than to the States. And he remained in Paris studying medicine. As a physician went to Oran, to al -- Algeria, married there, had one child. And during the conflict in Algeria with the liberation of Algeria from France, they came to live in Marseille. And they had a -- at the time of my marriage, they had a 13 year old -- 12 year old son. So they were coming to the wedding as well, and my brother-in-law, whom I| had met bef -- before he came to visit me one time in Switzerland. And everybody, of course, had waited for my USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079 \u00b0 brother-in-law Leon to -- to inform everyone, you know, who is this person that my husband was getting -- my future husband was getting ready to marry. And Leon is, you know, he\u2019s darling, he\u2019s here all the time, we are very close now. But a -- he wasn\u2019t very -- there\u2019s a big joke that at the time he only wrote to them, keep smiling. That\u2019s about what he sent to New York. And we had a good time, you know, we -- we -- when he came to visit, which was -- it would be before the wedding. And you know, we -- we rowed the boat and sang row, row, row the boat on Lake Geneva, and had a good time. But he -- he didn't tell me -- I mean, he was telling me things about Dan, but it was -- my future husband, but it was like, you know, sort of. So I had to de -- still depend on my letters, so he didn't -- wasn\u2019t very explicit. So -- and then of course -- so all these people were coming, and -- and Dan was coming two weeks ahead of time. And I think my -- so my wedding memories really go back to - mostly to that day when he arrived."

And this was -- yeah, it was almost a year, it was July 15\" -- I\u2019m sorry, August 15\" that he arrived. We were married September one. So my aunt, who now lives in Israel, the one who just recently did this interview with us. She remembers every single detail and tells it over and over and over again. She sort of lived through that with me. And this was -- this was one sort of aspect also of the wedding, is that she -- she was very lonely in -- in Switzerland. She was married to my uncle, my brother\u2019s -- my brother\u2019s ha -- I\u2019m sorry, my hu -- my father\u2019s brother. That was Yoshi and she\u2019s Monda. Monda and Yoshi survived Bergen-Belsen and ended up in Switzerland and had two children there. They lived from the beginning from hand to mouth, 1n fact they were in those camps, the relocation camps. And Monda got incredibly -- I don\u2019t know, I think I should say traumatized by the experience more-so than any of my other relatives. And her whole family except for her sister was killed in -- in -- during the war, and she found herself now in this new country without a language, without any means and -- and having these children, and she became -- basically she- she -- she spent all her time cleaning and cooking and just taking care and cleaning to the extent of being really beyond no-normal cleaning. I mean, to sacrificing any kind of -- much social contact. And they lived in this very closed Orthodox Jewish community, where she didn\u2019t have true, true, good friends. And she tells me the story that even my arrival was a sort of like they -- you know, they were wondering, you know, how is this going to be, they didn't have much money. And how was this USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079 \u00b0 going to be, you know, they have to support another person. And I was going to the university and I needed a bit of money for -- for tuition and for travel, because I -- they were in Montre and I had to travel to University of Lausanne by train. And they were able to get a little scholarship for me from the Jewish community. But it was a very close community. And what she found, and I\u2019m telling you what she says to me, what she found that -- that I became her best friend. Because at that point I was 19 and she was 30 some -- could figure out how old she was, but I can\u2019t remember it now. Anyway -- and when she found out that I had met my husband -- I mean my future husband on the train and when the letters arrived, she went through that courtship with me, and almost sort of vicariously lived through that. And so when the day came of the -- of the wa -- I mean, she remembers in detail what I said to her about, you know, when he proposed and -- and you know, where she was sitting. She was sitting in the -- she was working in the bathroom, cleaning something and I came and -- and told her and just exactly what I told her, you know, and so it was like a big thing for her, bigger than it was for me. I was like, yeah, I\u2019m getting married. Sort of a crazy 19 year old, 20 year old --"

But -- well, at least, because it was really longer that you don\u2019t see people in Orthodox Jewish wedding of -- weddings, the bride and groom are not to see each other. And we ran, of course, all over Montre that whole time because this had to be done and that had to be done. And the town was so small we ran into each other all the time. But officially we didn\u2019t see each Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection other. And then he was to -- to get me the bouquet. And of course you know -- you know what it\u2019s like here, I mean, how much you go through to for the bride to get these flowers and you\u2019re thinking about it. I told him I wanted to have white carnations. That\u2019s all I told him. I had no idea what to do and he had not the foggiest idea what to do. So, the afternoon before he goes to a florist and he said, I need a bouquet of white carnation. And they said, well, how many do you want? He said, well, whatever is appropriate for a bride. And they practically fainted [indecipherable] at the florist shop. Started running all over Montre apparently, looking for enough carnations to -- to make a bouquet, which they eventually came up with and put it together. So that\u2019s what he brought.

And he wanted to wear a yarmulke, which people here wear in Jewish weddings and that\u2019s fine. But that community and that level of observance called for a proper hat. A real -- one of those black hats, not a ha- top hat, but you know, a hat. Well, he want -- didn\u2019t want to wear one. So there was a really tight situation, and finally his mother persuaded him to wear it. And -- and he wore it just for under the chupah, that\u2019s it. After that he took it off the second he could. But he wore it. And we were married by -- by the grand rabbi of Luxembourg, who had been a memb -- who had been a friend of the family. And he came from Luxembourg to -- to marry us. And the chupah was outdoor, which 1s very proper in Orthodox Jewish weddings. It was outdoors in a beautiful setting, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079 \u00b0 with you know, mountains in the background. And the entire Jewish community was invited, but not for dinner. Dinner was just the family, but everybody was invited for, you know, right now I think they would say this is a [indecipherable] wedding, you know, because you had little sandwiches and drinks and that was -- you know, that was that and everybody came out.

I -- I remember USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079 in that I had, I don\u2019t know why it was mine, but I had a little Mogen Davide, that was family\u2019s. And why, at one time, must have been in one of those times when I felt like being Jewish was horrible because, you know, children told me that Jews killed Christ and it was terrible. And I gave that away. I gave it to one of my -- one of the like farmer girls, peasant girls. And I said, well, I\u2019m not going to need this. So that\u2019s story one. Then story two, I remember finding papers in the house, and I found a -- the music for [indecipherable] and I could play the piano and I played that and somehow like from some other world, that sounded very emotionally stirring to me. And I don\u2019t know how old I was. I was fairly young. And then, of course, came my - the watershed trip to -- to -- to Switzerland, when all of a sudden I found myself in an Orthodox family. And -- but -- but I had such a good feeling toward my uncle, that -- my father\u2019s brother. I-I remember seeing him as he waited -- he came to wait for me at the border and the train came into the border and I\u2019m looking out a window and I\u2019m thinking, am I going to recognize him? But I did, and he recognized me immediately. We did exchange pictures, but still I thought I might not recognize him, and I was fairly scared. That was 1954, I think, I was young and -- high school kid. And I had this really very warm experience and very emotional experience that this was someone I was related to. I had never -- I -- I hadn\u2019t -- from the time that I was like seven, when I saw my other co -- uncle for the last time, I never had any -- met any family members. It was so -- it was stirring. And then coming into this family, I was very willing to -- to learn and to find out and to think -- to accept the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079 ia fact that I was Jewish and -- and everything that went with it. And you know, at that point, I mean that -- that -- that -- that Mogen Davide experience was I must have been like eight years old or something. Was very long time ago. And -- but I -- I remembered it because I often thought about it later and I kind of regretted it. So it was -- it was sort of a new -- an -- an -- an -- an experience that -- that I was willing to -- to accept and it just felt -- it felt right, just sort of right. And, you know, when -- when I met Dan, of course, I -- I didn\u2019t know he was Jewish, because I couldn\u2019t tell Jews. I can -- you know, now I can. It\u2019s like I couldn\u2019t tell on the phone somebody who was from the south, and certainly someone who was black, I couldn\u2019t tell. I remember being totally surprised that Dan once got off the phone and said, this was a black lady and she wanted to know this and that. I was like, how do you know? You were on the phone. Are you clairvoyant or something? I didn\u2019t understand anything about language, and so I couldn\u2019t un -- I didn\u2019t know anything about people\u2019s physiognomy or recognizing anything special, or expressions or anything. Anyway -- and of course -- and he -- he, who would normally have recognized it, didn\u2019t recognize it in me because he never expected the Jew from Yugoslavia, in Yugoslavia, I should say.
