            "answer": "Wow. It was a very strange way that -- that I got married, to begin with, and I don\u2019t remember how much time I had to talk about that. But I mentioned at that time that I met my husband a year before, and we met on the train. All that was there, I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And so I haven\u2019t actually seen him prior to that, for a whole year. Prior to the wedding, I mean. For a whole year. He came two weeks before our wedding. And I had never in my life seen a Jewish wedding, and I have never -- so I really didn't know exactly what was going to happen. And very differently from weddings that I\u2019m witnessing now, including my sons. It never even occurred to me to think about arranging for anything or thinking about anything except my dress. That was about the only thing I thought about. And everything else I sort of just let be. It\u2019s like somebody -- was somebody else\u2019s thing to do it, a sort of -- sort of like I was going to a party, and my col -- main -- my -- my main concern was to think about, you know, Dan\u2019s coming and how 1s that going to be? Am I st -- am I truly, really in love or am I just making things up? Am I just bored in Switzerland, or unhappy in Switzerland or lonely? Because, of course, I had come there only -- less than a year before and I'd left all my friends behind in -- in Croatia and Yugoslavia. Had a boyfriend whom I, you know, forgot the minute I got on the train. Obviously it wasn\u2019t a very serious thing. And I lived a totally, totally different life in Switzerland than I had ever thought I would live. I mean, not only did I not know about Jewish weddings, I didn\u2019t know anything about Jewish period. And you know, I knew very little on -- my experience was one month in Switzerland before that, and I -- you know, a few years before that. So everything was sort of going to [indecipherable] plus I was going to meet my aunt and uncle, who were coming in from Switzerland - from -- I\u2019m sorry, from Israel, and I had never seen them as a adult.

I mean, I have -- I-I have -- I had very little -- almost no contact with them. My aunt, of course, I didn't even see a -- at all after the war. I only had pictures, I knew she existed.

That was Lina who married a wi -- a Weesler, and I knew that she had two children and I had the -- I had the daughter\u2019s photograph with me when I was living in -- in Yugoslavia. Her photograph was left because was -- had been sent to my maternal grandparents, must be. I don\u2019t know how I got that photograph. And it was she as a child, and it\u2019s a beautiful little girl with -- and she\u2019s holding a gorgeous doll. And I had that after the war. And it was sort of like all -- like looking at Shirley Temple, like a movie star or something, because we didn\u2019t have such dolls or such clothes or such anything. So that was -- that -- that was my only image of -- of this aunt with this daughter, my dau -- my cousin Dina who now lives in Israel. And her - her -- she had a brother, Rubin, whom -- whose picture I did not have and I -- he also now lives in Israel and of course, we now we know -- know each other. So -- so my aunt was coming. And then my uncle was coming, whom I last saw, I think as a seven or eight year old in Yugoslavia, because he came back from the prisoner of war camps -- camp. He was in Germany during the war.

He married a woman he met there in Yugoslavia, I think he may have known her from before. She and her three sisters had all together survived Auschwitz. Oh, it\u2019s a unbelievable story which I can\u2019t get her to talk about on tape, which I wish I could. They now live in Israel. But at that time he came -- he came, he found me in Ludbreg where I was living during the war, and he -- I remember that he -- he tried to talk to me about going with him, and I refused to go. I remem -- sort of remember that conversation. I -- I -- I had that memory, and of course he left me a picture, which I have, which you know, beautiful handwriting says, this is a -- in memor -- to remember him by. And he\u2019s wearing his army uniform. So, all of a sudden this aunt and uncle were going to come to the wedding. So that was going to be that. And of course my m -- my future mother-in-law was coming with my husband on the boat. And her brother, who is -- who survived the war -- actually th - my husband\u2019s family left -- left Russia actually mol -- Moldavia -- Moldova in the early 1900\u2019s, but this brother went to -- to France rather than to the States.

And Leon is, you know, he\u2019s darling, he\u2019s here all the time, we are very close now. But a -- he wasn\u2019t very -- there\u2019s a big joke that at the time he only wrote to them, keep smiling. That\u2019s about what he sent to New York. And we had a good time, you know, we -- we -- when he came to visit, which was -- it would be before the wedding. And you know, we -- we rowed the boat and sang row, row, row the boat on Lake Geneva, and had a good time. But he -- he didn't tell me -- I mean, he was telling me things about Dan, but it was -- my future husband, but it was like, you know, sort of. So I had to de -- still depend on my letters, so he didn't -- wasn\u2019t very explicit. So -- and then of course -- so all these people were coming, and -- and Dan was coming two weeks ahead of time. And I think my -- so my wedding memories really go back to - mostly to that day when he arrived."

So my aunt, who now lives in Israel, the one who just recently did this interview with us. She remembers every single detail and tells it over and over and over again. She sort of lived through that with me. And this was -- this was one sort of aspect also of the wedding, is that she -- she was very lonely in -- in Switzerland.

Monda and Yoshi survived Bergen-Belsen and ended up in Switzerland and had two children there. They lived from the beginning from hand to mouth, 1n fact they were in those camps, the relocation camps. And Monda got incredibly -- I don\u2019t know, I think I should say traumatized by the experience more-so than any of my other relatives. And her whole family except for her sister was killed in -- in -- during the war, and she found herself now in this new country without a language, without any means and -- and having these children, and she became -- basically she- she -- she spent all her time cleaning and cooking and just taking care and cleaning to the extent of being really beyond no-normal cleaning. I mean, to sacrificing any kind of -- much social contact. And they lived in this very closed Orthodox Jewish community, where she didn\u2019t have true, true, good friends.

And I was going to the university and I needed a bit of money for -- for tuition and for travel, because I -- they were in Montre and I had to travel to University of Lausanne by train. And they were able to get a little scholarship for me from the Jewish community. But it was a very close community. And what she found, and I\u2019m telling you what she says to me, what she found that -- that I became her best friend. Because at that point I was 19 and she was 30 some -- could figure out how old she was, but I can\u2019t remember it now. Anyway -- and when she found out that I had met my husband -- I mean my future husband on the train and when the letters arrived, she went through that courtship with me, and almost sort of vicariously lived through that. And so when the day came of the -- of the wa -- I mean, she remembers in detail what I said to her about, you know, when he proposed and -- and you know, where she was sitting. She was sitting in the -- she was working in the bathroom, cleaning something and I came and -- and told her and just exactly what I told her, you know, and so it was like a big thing for her, bigger than it was for me.

And he wanted to wear a yarmulke, which people here wear in Jewish weddings and that\u2019s fine. But that community and that level of observance called for a proper hat. A real -- one of those black hats, not a ha- top hat, but you know, a hat. Well, he want -- didn\u2019t want to wear one. So there was a really tight situation, and finally his mother persuaded him to wear it. And -- and he wore it just for under the chupah, that\u2019s it. After that he took it off the second he could. But he wore it. And we were married by -- by the grand rabbi of Luxembourg, who had been a memb -- who had been a friend of the family. And he came from Luxembourg to -- to marry us.

And funny that I never felt-- I know that there are people who feel -- and there are many foreign ESL teachers now, I mean foreign born ESL teachers now, and very often they will feel with the kids against that outside. But I never did. I just always felt that I was the American. And you know, people ca -- kids ask me, you know, where I\u2019m from and I said, well, I\u2019m from here, but I wasn\u2019t born here. I\u2019Il tell them right away.

They all came early, but they came in the 1920\u2019s, made a huge difference. So, my husband and -- and all the - and his brother and all the cousins, they were all first generation. They had all grown up with parents who talked about the old country, and so I was accepted absolutely totally and completely into the family. And they have -- that family has been absolutely fantastic to me.

The cousins that I mentioned before who were -- lived in Arlington, they eventually returned, had lived all over and then they came from -- th-they\u2019re -- they were in England and they\u2019re now in Arlington. And I see them all the time, we went to the march yesterday together. And the other cousin, this person\u2019s brother, Danny who lives in Long Island, they were just here also, they went to a wedding here, and they stayed with me. So it\u2019s just we\u2019re -- we are very -- everybody is very close, and their children are close to my children. My children, unfortunately, don\u2019t have any cousins. Their -- I only have these two children and my brother-in-law had no children and I have no siblings, so my children have no cousins. And they pretty much consider Dan\u2019s cousin\u2019s children their cousins and -- and they\u2019re quite close. So I was s-super, super lucky on that score as well."
