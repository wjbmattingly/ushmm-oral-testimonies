Then you had a -- a -- a wall that was made out of -- like the Berlin wall, like a plat -- bitum, or plaster, whatever you call that. And then you had the guard towers. I mean, every street in the concentration camp was watched -- you know, on each end there was a guard tower, you know? The Auschwitz camp itself was not even that large, but they concentrated so many people in one spot, an d that\u2122s how they could hold so many people. And then they were the outside camps, you know, part -- Auschwitz I, II and III. So you hold that -- and besides that, even let\u2122s say, even if a person would have been able to get out, where would they have go ne? Would have gone into another concentration camp, cause there was Birkenau, there was Buna, there was Auschwitz I, the main camp. And there were concentration camp all over the place. And besides, the SS were always on the lookout for something to happen, you know? They had dogs they would let them loose there. So there were only two pe ople that I know of that got out of that camp, that was Rudi Vrba and his friend. He got out because he was privileged. In other words, he worked for Kanada . Kanada was the place where all the goods came together [indecipherable] the people they robbed, the suitcases. And they found diamonds, they found all kinds of things, food. And they assorted it. Of course, sometimes the kapos did trade with the SS, you know? They said the SS would give them something, food, and they -- and they would give them the diamonds or whatever. And privileged people -- th ere was a -- ba -- a better class in Auschwitz , Interview with Jack Bass October 17, 2003 127like on the outside world, there was a dynast y. I mean there were people who had [indecipherable] and then there the real poor, like me. Like a lot of others. So Vrba got out because he got ahold of Russian tobacco, and they tra -- they somehow soaked that in some kind of an oil, and the dogs would not smell it, the dogs would not bark. They were hiding i-in the -- in the -- in a wooden shed there -- not a shed, it was like some kind of wooden thing that they had piled up, and they were inside. And of course when they were missing, the sirens started to wail, and they went -- but the SS almost caught them. The guy says to, \ufb01Did you look in that thing there?\ufb02 He says -- he lifted up one board, said, \ufb01There\u2122s nobody in there.\ufb02 So after three days they gave -- give up the search, and that\u2122s when they went out at night, and fled.

And I don\u2122t know any more, I don\u2122t remember what these were for, but I -- we had to take the cement bags from one end, the SS was standing on one end, and the kapos were standing the other - Interview with Jack Bass October 17, 2003 129- we had to take it just -- somebody put a cement bag on your back, you had to run over to the other end and put it there.

I kept up as long as I could, you know, and I -- all day, when I came back is -- into the camp, I thought I\u2122d die of -- I was such exhausted, you know. But second day I made sure that this kapo wouldn\u2122t get me. I figured if this is the worst, I mean it can\u2122t get any worse than that. So went [indecipherable] . What happened is we had to build the I. G. Farben Buna plant there, that\u2122s right, it was called Buna. Buna was an artificial rubber product, was used for s-shoe soles and things like that. We had to carry metal rods that were very long, I remember, and they were a part -- I would say at least 20 -- 25 prisoners to one rod -- to wa -- that\u2122s how long they were. But when you worked there, there were p-parts where you had to climb up the hill. When they climb up the hill you had all that weight on you. It was agony, believe me. You had to carry that things, and then th -- you had to go up, and you were glad when you were on top of the hill that you didn\u2122t -- some of the weight was already distributed more, on a regular basis, like. In other words, the other ones were carrying it as well. And that\u2122s was all there was to do in this camp, there were -- there was one Italian that made gas out of rotten foods, or what -- I don\u2122t know what it was. Rotten t -- [indecipherable] it stank terrible, it was -- it was called faulgas , and faul means foul, you know? Gas. And th ere were no cushiony jobs th -- Interview with Jack Bass October 17, 2003 130in -- in Buna, at least not at the time when I was there, and in Buna they had latrines. And I remember one night -- first of all there was -- t-they gave you a [indecipherable] pockets for people to urinate in. And the last one that came there, and it was full, had to go -- and nobody wanted to go and fa -- with the cold outside. So if you didn\u2122t go --"
