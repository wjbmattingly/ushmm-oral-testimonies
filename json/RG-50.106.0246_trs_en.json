Until the Russian, we escaped to the Russian side because in Austria we were away, the Russians were quite practically next to, well they were, the Russian army and the American army were kind of together at that time.

So Mr. Neiberg you were telling us that you came to Vienna after the war. So could you tell us a little about that? Nathan Neiberg: Stayed in Vienna of like a couple of weeks the captain of the post in Vienna, the Russian captain of the post in Vienna assigned us a place to stay in a hotel. And he supplied us with food and was very nice to us. After a few weeks I decided to go back to my home town in Poland to see who\u2019s left alive. Being in the station train came in from Poland and as the people walked off the train I recognized a few guys that came back from Poland. And I recognized that the war, during the war in the concentration camps. So I walked up to them and said what\u2019s going on in Poland. And they asked me which town I have come from. And I told them. So they said don\u2019t go to Poland to see who stayed alive because the Poles don\u2019t look at it, don\u2019t look at us welcome. That we should come back there even for a little while. They killed quite a few Jewish guys that came in to see if their parents are alive or somebody stayed alive in the family. So we advise you not to go back to Poland. But if you want to know go to Hungary. And in, there\u2019s quite a few a lot of Polish Jews that went to Hungary after the war. So go to Hungary. Find the, find Budapest. There are camps there. Refugee camps. Inquire there and you\u2019ll know more so there than if you go to Poland, go to your home town. So I decided instead of taking a train to Poland I took a train to Hungary. In those days there were no, you didn\u2019t have to pay for the seats on the train. You just boarded the train and you just went. And this is what I did. I came into Hungary and I didn\u2019t\u2019 meet there people from my own home town. And they in fact they told me that some of your brothers stayed alive too. But they didn\u2019t know where they are or  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They don\u2019t know which ones. They might have think about me but they didn\u2019t know. So I stayed a while in Budapest. There was a refugee camp in Budapest also. And then there was that they started to form Zionist groups in the refugee camps with the intentions of eventually going to Israel. At that time it was Palestine. It was not Israel yet there."

And they used to know the kind of route we took from Italy to Palestine and they were controlling that particular route. And they always used to catch the illegal ships trying to come to Palestine. And we were caught by them and we were brought to Haifa. They took us off from the ships that we came on. They were raiding us. Well we had a light fight with them before they took us, took over the ship. We threw at them rotten tomatoes and they got a little angry with us but it was over and they attached us to their ship and brought us into Haifa.
