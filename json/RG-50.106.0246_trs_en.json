And when we came in. We were all like this. But the people in the camp that were there looked worse than we were. So when we came in. When we came into the camp we just asked them how long was that you became you know they looked like you\u2019re going to a doctor and you see a skeleton. They were a skeleton. So we just wanted to find out how long it took them to become skeleton. And luckily it was right towards the end of the war. It was in 45. And it was already 45 in May. We came in.

But we jumped and we went in there was three or four of us, we went into a German peasant in a little town which was called in a town, the village was called Auw, next to Mauthausen. Maybe three or four kilometers away from Mauthausen. Mauthausen was next Interview with Nathan Neiberg 50 to a village, not to atown. The town of Mauthausen was a little bit further down. and we told the woman that we want food and we want a bed to sleep and a place to wash. Well she did give us a place to wash. And we told her what kind of food we want. It was an old lady and she says well I'll give you the food that you want but if you eat that food that you want, you\u2019re going to die. We were underweight and she knew where we came from so she said that\u2019s too fat for you. And this is why we left the camp too because the Americans didn\u2019t\u2019 feed us the proper food. So we said ok give us whatever you have but we\u2019re hungry. And she did. Little by little she gave us food that she felt without fat. And we stayed with her for a few weeks. Until the Russian, we escaped to the Russian side because in Austria we were away, the Russians were quite practically next to, well they were, the Russian army and the American army were kind of together at that time. And just across if you run out from the camp, from Mauthausen, you were on the Russian side. But if you were in the camp, you were on the American side. So we were on the Russian side. And one night the Russians came in, soldiers came in to the apartment and they knew that we speak German. And we told them we don\u2019t speak Russian. We speak Polish. Never mind they said. We want what do you call it, watches. We want rings, we want all kinds of things. So and you tell the Germans what we want. And I said we can\u2019t do that. Said you better do it. So we did it. We went with them. And we walked into their houses and we told them what they want. And the Germans thought that we splitting with them. And we went into one of the houses that the daughter was going out with the commandant, with the main guy, with the Russian. The daughter comes home and she says and the mother tells her that those Jews that live at the neighbors brought the Russians in to rob them. (phone rings) Well the daughter called the Russian that she walked out, that she was going with and that she was, he was, called him or whatever. And told him that the Jews tried to rob her parents. And she didn\u2019t tell him that the Interview with Nathan Neiberg 51 Russians tried to rob the parents, but the Jews. So he sends a soldier to tell us you should appear in front of him, 5:00 in the morning. So we thought between us if we appear and wake him up at 5:00 after his binge at night hell shoot us. We decided to run. The woman had two bikes and the neighbor had another two bikes and we told them look we don\u2019t\u2019 want to take it but if you want to give us the bikes because if we don\u2019t I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.

(file 2 \u2014 RG-50.106.0246.02.02; duration: 22:37) Interview with Nathan Neiberg 53 Katie St. John: This is Katie St. John taking over for Gail Schwartz in the interview of Nathan Neiberg on July 24, 2015. So Mr. Neiberg you were telling us that you came to Vienna after the war. So could you tell us a little about that? Nathan Neiberg: Stayed in Vienna of like a couple of weeks the captain of the post in Vienna, the Russian captain of the post in Vienna assigned us a place to stay in a hotel. And he supplied us with food and was very nice to us. After a few weeks I decided to go back to my home town in Poland to see who\u2019s left alive. Being in the station train came in from Poland and as the people walked off the train I recognized a few guys that came back from Poland. And I recognized that the war, during the war in the concentration camps. So I walked up to them and said what\u2019s going on in Poland. And they asked me which town I have come from. And I told them. So they said don\u2019t go to Poland to see who stayed alive because the Poles don\u2019t look at it, don\u2019t look at us welcome. That we should come back there even for a little while. They killed quite a few Jewish guys that came in to see if their parents are alive or somebody stayed alive in the family. So we advise you not to go back to Poland. But if you want to know go to Hungary. And in, there\u2019s quite a few a lot of Polish Jews that went to Hungary after the war. So go to Hungary. Find the, find Budapest. There are camps there. Refugee camps. Inquire there and you\u2019ll know more so there than if you go to Poland, go to your home town. So I decided instead of taking a train to Poland I took a train to Hungary. In those days there were no, you didn\u2019t have to pay for the seats on the train. You just boarded the train and you just went. And this is what I did. I came into Hungary and I didn\u2019t\u2019 meet there people from my own home town. And they in fact they told me that some of your brothers stayed alive too. But they didn\u2019t know where they are or Interview with Nathan Neiberg 54 they didn\u2019t\u2019 see them but they heard from other people that they came across that they feel that some of the Neibergs, Neiberg brothers stayed alive. They don\u2019t know which ones. They might have think about me but they didn\u2019t know. So I stayed a while in Budapest. There was a refugee camp in Budapest also. And then there was that they started to form Zionist groups in the refugee camps with the intentions of eventually going to Israel. At that time it was Palestine. It was not Israel yet there."
