The \u0152 technically, we had off every second Sunday, but we did not \u0152 but they did Interview with David Halivni June 13, 2014 34not really realized it. The al \u0152 the SS always found an excuse. Supposedly we are volunteering. But the \u0152 nevertheless, it happened a few sunda \u0152 a few hours where we could sit and \u0152 and do nothing, the SS didn\u2122t bother us. So there was the ca \u0152 the \u0152 th-the \u0152 the ca \u0152 the people that worked, it\u2122s called \u0152 it was called Ackerman(ph) who do the drilling, and who had th \u0152 they had kapo, also the name of Weiss. And when we were sitting that do \u0152 that Sunday , or that \u0152 we sort of \u0152 supposedly free Sunday, he was [indecipherable] and we talked, I remembered what we learned in si \u0152 the [indecipherable] of sha \u0152 Sh-Shabbat, because the people knew it from the book, from the prayer book and so on. And I was sort of a leader. He saw that, and sort of decided that he\u2122ll take me in in his company. Ackerman(ph), who was doing the \u0152 it was a very difficult company, and therefore, while the others worked 12 hours and na \u0152 they worked only 10. And the occasion, sometim es they even got cigarettes from the company, from \u0152 so when I got cigarettes, I sold it for bread. So, the idea was why \u0152 why would they take me to a company which worked so ha \u0152 was more difficult than the others? Because those drillers, you know, that made the hole, had to be sharpened. And they didn\u2122t want that to be bring to a fire, to a schmidder(ph) \u0152 to a smith. They wa \u0152 they didn \u2122t want to do it in the ca \u0152 in the \u0152 in the \u0152 in the tunnel itself, fire, so it was outside. So somebody had to bring those dri-driller to the schmi \u0152 where they sharpened, and bring it back, two or three Interview with David Halivni June 13, 2014 35times, or more times during a \u0152 a night, le t\u2122s say. So, if I \u0152 and usually chose the youngest \u0152 I was the youngest \u0152 to do that work. That mean that was much easier, and I also \u0152 the person also got the bene fits, because the company did not notice. So, he took me in \u0152 into that \u0152 in his company, and I had those privilege. So, during my \u0152 at night, when we worked at night, I used to do four or five times, going through from a \u0152 from the \u0152 the place of wo rk, inside the hotel, pending \u0152 every day it got larger and larger, to the outside where they were sharpened, and bring it back, and so on. That\u2122s why I said before, I walked with [indecipherable] . I had to be very careful, because when the other people took out the \u0152 the stones, the \u0152 the \u0152 the pla \u0152 the \u0152 where the dynamite explod ed, they had then a ca \u0152 a little cheela(ph) they called, a ca \u0152 a little [indecipherable] car \u0152 cars, so \u0152 and there was hardly any room for a car or for a human being, ha d to \u0152 there were cases where people [indecipherable] . So, on the way, there was, in a crossroad, there was a German, who was not a German, was a toad.

That, I think is unforgiveable for the \u0152 the survivors, for the sufferer, and u \u0152 and unforgiveable for the truth, objective truth. If you say that it is sin, that mean s it was coming to them.

The Rabbi [indecipherable] thought the Zionist is the sin. And some people are bor \u0152 rabbis in Israel thought the \u0152 the anti-Zionists. We must say, I do insist that the Holo caust is a metaphysical. Certainly it\u2122s not because they were \u0152 some Jews were commu nists, or some Jews were capitalists.
