Could it be that I reminded him of the years when he had power, and that caused that? Or, he still had some power, and he knew about the deportation. He knew I had [indecipherable] time. In any case, a few month later \u2014 later, of course he was deported, and he was \u2014 so, let me go back.

            "answer": "Right, he is the \u2014 the \u2014 I do say, I say it in the book. There are two people who had the influence. One was the grandfather, who was a er \u2014 great Talmud scholar, but old-fashioned, if I may use the word [indecipherable] the old-fashioned, but the \u2014 who \u2014 who \u2014 who taught themself [indecipherable] at night, he used to give a\u2014a lesson [indecipherable] Talmud. And \u2014 and he brought me up, that\u2019s the male figure that I know. He was very poor, he could hardly support me and my mom, my mother and another sister.

So I was brought up, and of course, along these lines. And then people asked \u2014 even today asked me how \u2014 where it comes from. I can\u2019t answer the question. Since I remember, even when I was five or six years, and lived under the influence of grandfather, I wanted to study secular knowledge. I wanted to have secular knowledge."

When I was a chi \u2014 five, six years even, and I used to pray, daven, and I said the prayer [indecipherable] God give us in our heart, understanding, to understand you and so on. I remember I used to look at the window, signifying outside knowledge as well, not only religious knowledge. Where I got that \u2014 that urge, I don\u2019t know.

The \u2014 technically, we had off every second Sunday, but we did not \u2014 but they did Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with David Halivni ~ June 13, 2014 not really realized it. The al \u2014 the SS always found an excuse. Supposedly we are volunteering. But the \u2014 nevertheless, it happened a few sunda \u2014 a few hours where we could sit and \u2014 and do nothing, the SS didn\u2019t bother us. So there was the ca \u2014 the \u2014 th-the \u2014 the ca \u2014 the people that worked, it\u2019s called \u2014 1t was called Ackerman(ph) who do the drilling, and who had th \u2014 they had kapo, also the name of Weiss. And when we were sitting that do \u2014 that Sunday, or that \u2014 we sort of \u2014 supposedly free Sunday, he was [indecipherable] and we talked, I remembered what we learned in si\u2014 the [indecipherable] of sha \u2014 Sh-Shabbat, because the people knew it from the book, from the prayer book and so on. And I was sort of a leader. He saw that, and sort of decided that he\u2019ll take me in in his company. Ackerman(ph), who was doing the \u2014 it was a very difficult company, and therefore, while the others worked 12 hours and na \u2014 they worked only 10. And the occasion, sometimes they even got cigarettes from the company, from \u2014 so when I got cigarettes, I sold it for bread. So, the idea was why \u2014 why would they take me to a company which worked so ha \u2014 was more difficult than the others? Because those drillers, you know, that made the hole, had to be sharpened. And they didn\u2019t want that to be bring to a fire, to a schmidder(ph) \u2014 to a smith. They wa \u2014 they didn\u2019t want to do it in the ca \u2014 1n the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the tunnel itself, fire, so it was outside. So somebody had to bring those dri-driller to the schmi \u2014 where they sharpened, and bring it back, two or three Interview with David Halivni * June 13, 2014 times, or more times during a \u2014 a night, let\u2019s say. So, if I\u2014 and usually chose the youngest \u2014 I was the youngest \u2014 to do that work. That mean that was much easier, and I also \u2014 the person also got the benefits, because the company did not notice. So, he took me in \u2014 into that \u2014 in his company, and I had those privilege. So, during my \u2014 at night, when we worked at night, I used to do four or five times, going through from a \u2014 from the \u2014 the place of work, inside the hotel, pending \u2014 every day it got larger and larger, to the outside where they were sharpened, and bring it back, and so on. That\u2019s why I said before, I walked with [indecipherable]. I had to be very careful, because when the other people took out the \u2014 the stones, the \u2014 the \u2014 the pla \u2014 the \u2014 where the dynamite exploded, they had then a ca \u2014 a little cheela(ph) they called, a ca \u2014a little [indecipherable] car \u2014 cars, so \u2014 and there was hardly any room for a car or for a human being, had to \u2014 there were cases where people [indecipherable].
