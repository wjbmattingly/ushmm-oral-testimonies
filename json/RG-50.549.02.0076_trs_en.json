            "answer": "The Jewish community in Trencin consisted of about 2,000 souls out of a population of about 19,000, so it was a very large Jewish community. The Jewish community was centered around the school, which was a parochial school, and the synagogue. The -- the -- so far as I can remember, my grandfather always took me to prayers on Saturday morning. There was regulated holidays that had to be kept, and my mother maintained originally, during the 30\u2019s, before the trouble started, she maintained a kosher home. It was a -- a Jewish religious procedure that didn\u2019t make much sense to me. What particularly didn't make sense to me 1s that all the praying was done in ancient Hebrew, and I didn\u2019t understand a word of it. They never tried to teach us what all of this mumbo-jumbo meant. As a matter of fact, my father, although he was one of the leading lights of the community, was known to be highly critical of the local rabbi for never speaking Slovak, or even German that people could understand. So there was this peculiar dichotomy, on the one hand of a very formal, ritualized religious experience and a gradual rebellion against the -- which was largely engendered by the time I was about seven, by my association with the local Zionist organization, co -- Hashomer Hatzair, which was a leftist This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And as time went on, this influence became stronger and stronger, because that was a community that made lots of sense. The songs were very good. The -- the s-singing in the synagogue was always wailing. The -- the -- the singing in the Hashomer Hatzair was very zippy. Subsequently I found out that much of the communist singing was actually stolen from the Zionists, and -- but the songs were very strong. I always said, years later, that the communists and the leftists always had the best songs and the ugliest girls. But the songs were great, and the entertainment was great, and there was a great deal of hiking, and -- and sort of rebellion organization - r-rebellions -- rebellious thinking against the environment that was closing in on us, already starting in \u00b036."

My grandfather, the religious grandfather highly disapproved of it, but my sister, Ella already was part of this religious and -- anti- religious attitude, and she had joined Hashomer Hatzair before me, so she sort of dragged me in.

At any rate, meanwhile she made a living by having a very small store selling embroidery. And this was embroidery patterns. So when the little girls had to come in to start working on their trousseau, they had to come to Emma\u2019s little shop and she imprinted on their pieces of linen, patterns. And 1n those days, my mother tells me, the girls had to start working on their trousseau at the age of five. I mean -- I mean, if you didn\u2019t get married by the time you were 19, you were really just not marriageable, or wa -- there was something wrong with you. At any rate, the girls started working on a trousseau, and because the girls had to come in and do very complex embroidery, my grandmother could tell how intelligent the girl was, and how industrious she was, which was two criteria, basically, for recommending somebody.

Now why I did it, I don\u2019t know, but it should have sort of -- you know, I got a kick out of it. Particularly the -- the teacher, who was caning me, was an idiot. And he didn't hear well, he didn\u2019t speak well, didn\u2019t see well. He was in his last year before retirement, and I think I just had to get at him one way or another.

So I told my sister, you take everything is here -- by the way, I never took a penny out of that place. Never took a penny, I\u2019ve never claimed anything. I was never paid or made any claims to the Germans, although all the other Jews did. Never wanted to touch it, that was tainted stuff.

A long employee who owed very much to my father. His wife was very unhappy, his wi -- by the way, the marriage was a bad marriage to begin with. And she was grousing about, y-you -- you know, the Germans coming, finding me there and shooting the whole family because they to -- that is what the Germans were advertising, anybody hiding a Jew is going to be executed. So I -- I was told to just go out to the -- near the river, and sit there during the day, when presumably the Germans were going to do house to house searches and then come back at night and they\u2019re going to feed me. And the big decision, this is one of these fulcrum decisions which sort of imprinted me on my whole model, walking away. When I sat at the river, I said, I\u2019m not going to go back. I\u2019m rather going to go take my chances where the shooting was than go back to what is presumably a safe house. Same thing happened in \u00b048 -- or \u201946, you know, I could have stayed there, but this idea of walking was by that time very heavily imprinted in me.

Well, lots of partisans lost their life that way. I just didn\u2019t do that. There was always a bunch of guys who say, well, it\u2019s just too dangerous. So this idea of not necessarily staying comfortable, but doing the contrary thing is something which is not just Paul Strassmann, this 1s something, when you look at history of Jews -- I\u2019m just finished reading for the second time Paul Johnson\u2019s history of th -- of Jews. You know, when you say, well how did the Jews survive for, you know, whatever thousand years it was, you know, how did they move from -- from Sumer to Egypt to Canaan to Assyria to Babylon and back and forth. And then went to Persia, then went to -- to -- to -- to Damascus and to Anatolia. Th-The -- the wandering Jew. Well, the survival of the Jews was one that they always were ready to move. They would have stayed put, they would have died and perished like everybody else who stayed put. So this is not just a Paul Strassmann kind of an imprint, it\u2019s just deeply -- now whether it\u2019s genetic, I doubt, but it is, what do you call it, r-racial, or religious or psychological orientation. It\u2019s something that -- that very much has been a pattern of everything I\u2019ve done and how I\u2019ve progressed in the United States."

And so in gaming theory -- this is called option theory, by the way, and by the way Van Neumann did a formal analysis of this [indecipherable] so -- so there\u2019s a mathematical basis for it. In gaming theory you have to look always for space, for more options, even if 1t costs you more, because once you have more options, even if the price is higher, the probability of you possibly doing better is greater than if you are what\u2019s called, in a zero sum game.

                " According to this theory of option, 1t means that if you stay hidden in a house of an employee whose wife is sort of a hostile party to this whole deal, you are basically cooped up and there\u2019s no options. I mean, you are just totally wedged in, and you have no place to go.

But we always knew that the day of reckoning will come when the front moves in from the east, and the Germans retreat. At that time, there will be wholesale destruction and annihilation and murder and who knows what happens. And so, starting in \u201943, we started rehearsing where do we go, where do we hide when the front moves. My father had set up a hiding place, and then a fall-back hiding place and a third place.

My father took over custody of his wife and his son. So -- and there were two aunts, so my father took a truck from the business, loaded everybody and in we go into Selec to hide. Of course, the whole village saw that here comes a whole bunch of Jews, you know. It was just not well thought out. So we were there for two days, which was, I think August 27 and 28 and my father recognized this was really -- 1t was just too noisy, there were just too many people.

And it was a bureaucratically highly organized process of taking property away. The -- it was very important that the various people who owed their loyalty to the Nazis and to the Slovak, were getting as much property as possible. So it started as a way of stripping the Jews of property, shipping most of the Jews, like 85 percent of the Jews into annihilation camps, and then whoever was left, depriving them of all the civil rights and -- and property and radios and fur coats and -- and automobiles, and- and -- you know, th-there was a long list, I still have those lists of what you can or cannot do, and what street you can be on, what is your curfew, whether you can have a window looking at the street, or not looking at the street.

So -- so that was in \u201945, I immediately went there. Since then a v -- you know, under the communists, I couldn\u2019t go back. The -- it was shut down in 1948, when the communists took over. First time I went back to Trencin was in -- maybe in 1978 or \u201979. By that time the house was razed and a huge monster complex was built up as -- for Soviet kind of apartments. But I go there now at least once a year, sometimes twice a year. I just finished a very major project in Trencin, which may be of interest to you. When I went there in 1986, I went finally to the synagogue, which of course was converted into some kind of a music hall, but next to the synagogue was a small chapel, and everything was piled in, what that was left from the synagogue into the chapel. It was a warehou -- 1-it was a ma -- badly messed up closet, that\u2019s all 1t was, the benches were stacked up. And on the wall were the names of the Jews that perished. 1536 names.

And -- and I usually don\u2019t look back. It was interesting, about two days ago I had a conversation with my daughter. She had a contract that expired early in 2003, and the people paid her for awhile, and then she protested and so they finally gave her a new contract. And th -- it\u2019s a nice contract, it\u2019s a three year contract. The question was, they didn\u2019t pay her for about four month and there was a back pay issue. And her husband screamed at her that she should not sign a contract because th-they owe her back pay. I say, forget about it. Forget about back pay, you know. It\u2019s gone, you know\u201d? Look forward, they\u2019re giving you a good deal for the next three years. Take it and run."

So there was a man by the name of Henry Kaiser, who used to make automobiles, who set up two assembly lines of making ships. They were called Liberty ships, they were sort of tack welded together. He made one ship every two days. And they were sort of tacky, and against all the code violations and what have you, but they brought the troops back and forth, brought them home. You know, the -- the Germans sank a few, but not too many. They went -- used to go in big convoys. And then in 1946, the relief for Europe, much of the grain went in Liberty ships. But by \u201948 those ships were just too small for that sort of thing, so they retired them down in the James River. I mean, there were -- I used to fly over the James River, there used to be couple of hundred Liberty ships tied up in James River. I say, which one did I come in on? They were all the same.

I mean, there was no -- not too many immigrants -- or emigrants from Europe, you know, because the visas were very hard to get, particularly immigration. But starting in \u201946 and \u00b047, lots of American college kids used to just go to Europe to -- just to see Europe, for whatever reasons. And that was the cheapest way how to get back. And many of them subsequently became quite famous. For instance, on the ship was Leonard Rose, who subsequently became a very famous cellist.

Cooper Union 1s a tough school because it\u2019s all -- everybody there is on scholarship. And it was very competitive, these were -- this was the last crop of World War II veterans who went on the G.I. Bill of Rights to school, and th-they -- they were a different generation, I mean, very serious students, I mean no horseplay, no nothing. And my conclusions was that although I loved engineering and always wanted to be an engineer, I felt that I just didn\u2019t have -- I was not an educated person. And there was a trustee of Cooper Union by the name of Rossi, who set up a scholarship for the Sloane School at M.I.T., which in those days was other than Harvard Business School, but for engineers it was the school on -- on -- on -- on management. And I was nominated for the Rossi scholarship, because of all of that. And I basically said that -- that I would love to go to M.LT. -- and by the way, M.I.T. accepted me, but a Strassmann doesn\u2019t take scholarship money from anybody, I am self-supporting. Now everybody tells me, including my wife Mona, that was absolutely stupid. But I declined the scholarship because I considered it a act of charity.

He said, you know what? Let me take you off this -- this drawing board and let me put you to work on the New Jersey turnpike. For the next two years in grad school, I processed hundred thousands of punch cards from the New Jersey turnpike, through the only place in the world where there was a computer like this, M.I.T.. When I got done I had a Master\u2019s thesis, which is today considered to be the first Master\u2019s thesis in the United States on business application of computer.

And I wanted to point out that -- that -- that unit, perhaps, is the first organized Jewish military unit that went to war since A.D. 70. There was some interest on the part of the Holocaust Museum, but in those days the Holocaust Museum was very much concerned about crying about the enormity of the crime, Holocaust. The idea of fighting, Jews fighting and opposing by action, the actions on the part of the Germans was not high on the agenda, except there was a -- a researcher in the -- in the -- the Holocaust Museum, a Dr. Sybil Milton, who got very much interested in the subject, and subsequently, when I was in Washington, I met with Dr. Milton several times, we had lunch together. And I tried to convey to you my sense of the Holocaust, namely that this was not necessary some evil maniac plot, but 1t was a historical evolution of a state machinery that went berserk. In other words, the Nazis and Hitler unleashed the power of the state to its ultimate form of destruction. You know, the state has always done pogroms and done injustice, and done all kinds of things, but here, the superiority of industrial organization and scientific organization, in fact, went to its ultimate conclusion, namely, we are just going to plan, methodically, to destroy people. And the enormity of the Holocaust really lies This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

In other words, it was planned as an engineer could -- conscious process, where they were actually calculating the capacity of the cars, the capacity of the killing, how quickly can we burn them. In other words, they applied scientific management. And that is really the grossness, the horror of this thing, which I called the -- the bureaucratization of Holocaust. In other words, the bureaucratization of genocide. And the point that I was raising was that with advanced information technology, the state can, through control of people, and eliminating privacy in the future, basically grind masses of people to destruction. In other words, endemic in the structure of modern civilization, of industrialization, 1s a capability of massive destruction, by means out of anatomic weapons. Sybil Milton was very, very much taken by it. I then subsequently provided to the Holocaust Museum, a collection of documents which I assembled, my sister actually helped with it, which showed methodically how the various laws were used in Slovakia to gradually strip an innkeeper, who was a veteran from World War I, and who received special license to be an innkeeper and how that was taken away, and this was taken away and the fur coats was taken, and radio was taken, and so on, until you finally got rid of the innkeeper altogether and then gassed him. And I gave a collection of something like 30 documents, where the wife actually got a receipt for the husband. In other words, the bureaucracy worked with perfection and completeness and everything was legitimate and everything was signed and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It was passed by a duly elected parliament. And then, of course, Sybil said, yeah, but where do computers come into this thing? And I said, well I don\u2019t know, but when I look at this succession of how Mr. Flak got eliminated, I can see a computerized society doing it much more efficiently, much more expeditiously, without any errors. Sybil then went away. A month later Sybil calls me up and say, I have something interesting for you. She sends to me in the mail, copies of three pages from some kind of German documentation, which shows a punch card, and shows a picture of what\u2019s called a Hollerith, Deutsche Hollerith machine, and says, could you tell me what it is? And -- and of course I said, surely, this 1s -- this is a machine that is being used, using census data in order to make sure that all the Jews and their property is properly filtered out so that you can schedule the Jews to destruction. And she said, you know, we are building a -- a Holocaust Museum, it\u2019s all crying and weeping, and what have you, but there\u2019s nothing in there about this concept of the grindstone of the bureaucracy actually being an engine of the Holocaust. And she said, you know, it would be very interesting to be able to prove that the Germans actually used computers in tabulating mach -- she didn\u2019t distinguish between tabulating machine and -- and I said, yeah, that would be very interesting.

By the way, that argument has been made. Now, with that structure, and then harnessing the power of the state, they were then able to execute a crime in a very well structured method, which took advantage of all the best managerial know-how, such as being taught in schools today, of management. In fact, people get MBAs in subjects which are closely related to that, except they apply to cattle and apply to krispies, and hamburgers and what have you. Now, the evidence for this thing really is in what\u2019s called a transaction cost. The transaction costs for executing this crime were very low, because this was largely self funding. For instance, the Slovak paid the Germans, as you know, 10 marks for every body for resettlement and reeducation fees. The confiscations were self funding. Eichmann actually produced a profit and loss statement, because through the confiscation and so forth, they were able to get a large amount of gold into the coffers of their Reich system, although sooner or later the corruption crept in, but nevertheless, it was run as a business. The business was based on the fact that a very small number of people at corporate headquarters, with some enforcement, could take care of problems which involved the marshalling and destruction of millions of people. And one of the key elements in that process was the utilization of the Jewish organizations in co-opting the Jewish organizations into the liquidation process. The deportation lists from my town, Trencin, that I used to trace the authenticity of who was a victim or not, were This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

The supervision and the guidance of, you know, going to this car, and going to this car, was done mostly by Jews with the enforcers onlooking except when there were some hooligans who did some stupid things, you know, like beat up people and so forth. But most of it was done in a fairly organized fashion. So now comes the Holocaust Museum, and you have a list of Holocaust survivors. And then you have a list of Holocaust survivor donors. And then you have interviews with these donors who are being awarded this or that, and being treated to this or that dinner. And then you have the Los Angeles chapter, and then you have the New York chapter, etcetera, etcetera.
