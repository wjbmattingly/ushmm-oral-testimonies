            "answer": "The earliest that I remember of my childhood was the -- the rituals of the family that revolved around Jewish holidays. The peak holiday was, of course, always Pesach, Passover, and it was big fuss, the dishes had to be changed. And lots of cooking took place. I always ran errands for my mother, helping her out. And I remember, perhaps as early as at the age of four or five, I learned how to pull the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 \u00b0 dough to make a streudel-thin dough. These are all trivial examples of what I remember."

            "answer": "The Jewish community in Trencin consisted of about 2,000 souls out of a population of about 19,000, so it was a very large Jewish community. The Jewish community was centered around the school, which was a parochial school, and the synagogue. The -- the -- so far as I can remember, my grandfather always took me to prayers on Saturday morning. There was regulated holidays that had to be kept, and my mother maintained originally, during the 30\u2019s, before the trouble started, she maintained a kosher home. It was a -- a Jewish religious procedure that didn\u2019t make much sense to me. What particularly didn't make sense to me 1s that all the praying was done in ancient Hebrew, and I didn\u2019t understand a word of it. They never tried to teach us what all of this mumbo-jumbo meant. As a matter of fact, my father, although he was one of the leading lights of the community, was known to be highly critical of the local rabbi for never speaking Slovak, or even German that people could understand. So there was this peculiar dichotomy, on the one hand of a very formal, ritualized religious experience and a gradual rebellion against the -- which was largely engendered by the time I was about seven, by my association with the local Zionist organization, co -- Hashomer Hatzair, which was a leftist USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 : organization, who was, at least mildly speaking, anti-religious, socialist, communalist, and totally rejecting the existence in the -- in the -- 1n the -- in the -- in the Slovak environment and totally focused on everybody getting out and moving to Palestine, and to live in a kibbutz in a communal Utopian environment. And as time went on, this influence became stronger and stronger, because that was a community that made lots of sense. The songs were very good. The -- the s-singing in the synagogue was always wailing. The -- the -- the singing in the Hashomer Hatzair was very zippy. Subsequently I found out that much of the communist singing was actually stolen from the Zionists, and -- but the songs were very strong. I always said, years later, that the communists and the leftists always had the best songs and the ugliest girls. But the songs were great, and the entertainment was great, and there was a great deal of hiking, and -- and sort of rebellion organization - r-rebellions -- rebellious thinking against the environment that was closing in on us, already starting in \u00b036."

            "answer": "Well, I wouldn\u2019t say so. My grandfather, the religious grandfather highly disapproved of it, but my sister, Ella already was part of this religious and -- anti- religious attitude, and she had joined Hashomer Hatzair before me, so she sort of dragged me in. And also, one of the teachers in the Jewish school was a -- a rebel. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 \u00b0 He turned out to be, subsequently, the editor of the Pravda newspaper, and of course, they shot him afterwards in the anti -- anti-Communist purges. But -- so there was a very lively environment going on, a tremendous amount of change, and a great deal of debates about the future and ideas. So I was exposed to ideas like that very early in my childhood."

            "answer": "Oh, Grandmother Emma was really something very special. She was married to my maternal grandfather, Alexander Weiner, who was a master cabinetmaker. It was apparently a deep love because during the first World War, when he went to war, and no, he didn\u2019t write for a couple of years, everybody thought that he died, and she got very, very sick. At any rate, meanwhile she made a living by having a very small store selling embroidery. And this was embroidery patterns. So when the little girls had to come in to start working on their trousseau, they had to come to Emma\u2019s little shop and she imprinted on their pieces of linen, patterns. And 1n those days, my mother tells me, the girls had to start working on their trousseau at the age of five. I mean -- I mean, if you didn\u2019t get married by the time you were 19, you were really just not marriageable, or wa -- there was something wrong with you. At any rate, the girls started working on a trousseau, and because the girls had to come in and do very complex embroidery, my grandmother could tell how intelligent the girl was, and how industrious she was, which was two criteria, basically, for recommending somebody. So my maternal grandmother, Emma, apparently was known very widely in the whole community as absolutely reliable I.Q. testing that - USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 \u2019 that never made a mistake. And so she made a living, b-both as a marriage broker, as well as a -- as a Seller of embroidery."

Marriage brokers were paid, and of course the other thing was that my grandfather Weiner made -- was known for making chests which were inlain -- inlaid -- h-he did very fine cabinetry. This was inlaid wood veneer. And so, usually somebody who was a little wealthier, at the age of six or seven, they were starting to get on the queue with my grandfather Alexander, to start making a chest. Well, Grandfather Weiner liked to drink, and so the delivery on these chests was always uncertain. But he was a fun guy. He was always singing, he -- he -- he was really -- Grandfather Weiner took m-more c-care of me than anybody else in the family, because he had the time. And I was then apprenticed to him at the age of 11, and he taught me how to do inlaid veneer. So I worked for him for awhile. So it was a very colorful kind of an experience."

I-I was known as the troublemaker. I-I had a reputation as being a particularly rebellious child. And years later some people tell me about kind of the pranks that I used to pull, and my father was a very stern task maker, and I just had to tow the line and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 \u00b0 very often I didn\u2019t. But the rebellion was there to begin with. My mother was a very loving woman, but she was really the brains behind the business, we ran a big business, my father had a big business. She was the cashier. She was the peacemaker am-among the employees. She was very charitable. She was actually the head of the WIZO, which was the women\u2019s Zionist organization, in Trencin. Everybody loved her, a-although there were some women who wore a grudge against her because she stole the best man in town. And 1 -- years later, a woman who survived told me that she could have been my mother. She was a -- she had her eye on -- on my father, except for that conniving matchmaker, your grandmother.

            "answer": "Where does the rebelliousness come from, I don\u2019t know. I was not considered to be a bright child. I was not considered to be one of the leading scholars. I mean, there were kids who were -- had better grades than I did. I was always looking at things. I-I must say that one of the memories that I have was that in the third grade - so I must have been eight years old, maybe less, I became very interested in condoms, which was a no-no thing in those days. I mean, that was totally out of -- out of bound for everybody. And I did not know exactly what it was, but I was told this is really hush-hush. Well, what happened is that through some arrangements, I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 \u00b0 got hold of a pack and brought them to school. Now, that was considered to be -- I was badly beaten up. You know -- in those days, you know, the kids got physical punishment. I had to stretch my hands, and I got caned over my hands. Now why I did it, I don\u2019t know, but it should have sort of -- you know, I got a kick out of it. Particularly the -- the teacher, who was caning me, was an idiot. And he didn't hear well, he didn\u2019t speak well, didn\u2019t see well. He was in his last year before retirement, and I think I just had to get at him one way or another. So -- so, discipline was always a problem with -- with me, including some really bad st-stunts that I pulled on girls, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s history."

            "answer": "Property, yeah. We had a heri -- heritage property. I could have inhe -- I -- presumably I was inheriting lots of land, houses. My decision to walk was much earlier than when people were forced out by the communists. I -- although many of the Jews who came back, they were spending their time reclaiming properties and going to court, and going through recovery and reclamation and restitution and all of this thing, I wanted no part of it. I didn\u2019t -- never touched it in my years there. I basically felt that the -- the country was poisoned. The people that I saw on the streets when I walked, were -- were the people who were killing and stealing and robbing and -- and -- and committing crimes, including the people who gradually USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 * came to the forefront 1n a political position. These are people I knew from the uprising as criminals. You know, I said, I just don\u2019t want to live in this country. Just don\u2019t want to be there, regardless. So I told my sister, you take everything is here -- by the way, I never took a penny out of that place. Never took a penny, I\u2019ve never claimed anything. I was never paid or made any claims to the Germans, although all the other Jews did. Never wanted to touch it, that was tainted stuff. So this is -- this is a very important characteristic of my experience that -- that I did not cling -- I do not cling to things which are basically, in my view, morally evil. When you see anything that\u2019s morally evil, wrong, you don\u2019t stick around. And -- and that is really the reason why, starting in 1946, the idea was, I\u2019m not going to stick around, I\u2019m just going to go wherever I can. Of course, the idea was to go to America, where there was unlimited opportunity and nobody knew me."

            "question": "Now, was it that clear cut in the beginning? I mean, th -- all -- did you rationally think through the pros and cons of leaving everything and going with nothing to America?",
            "answer": "Well, the big moment, the big moment in my life, you know, in -- in other words, in -- when you look at life, there are only few things which are so called, a fulcrum. And this is when you roll your dice, and if you don\u2019t roll the dice right, you die. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- or -- or perish, or whatever. When the - when the uprising took place and -- and the Germans started persecuting Jews and partisans and arresting people, we went to predetermined houses where we wo -- you know, hide and we -- the Christians are going to keep us hidden and we were going to crawl into the attic, or crawl into a closet or -- or whatever. And, you know, these experiences, everybody has a different experience about what they did. I went to the house, which you may or may not recall from my interview, to the house of an employee who was a very trusted interview -- employee of -- of my father\u2019s. A long employee who owed very much to my father. His wife was very unhappy, his wi -- by the way, the marriage was a bad marriage to begin with. And she was grousing about, y-you -- you know, the Germans coming, finding me there and shooting the whole family because they to -- that is what the Germans were advertising, anybody hiding a Jew is going to be executed. So I -- I was told to just go out to the -- near the river, and sit there during the day, when presumably the Germans were going to do house to house searches and then come back at night and they\u2019re going to feed me. And the big decision, this is one of these fulcrum decisions which sort of imprinted me on my whole model, walking away. When I sat at the river, I said, I\u2019m not going to go back. I\u2019m rather going to go take my chances where the shooting was than go back to what is presumably a safe house. Same thing happened in \u00b048 -- or \u201946, you know, I could have stayed there, but this idea of walking was by that time very heavily imprinted in me. Also, th-that my behavior in -- in the partisans was very much -- a-as you know, during the partisan USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 \" warfare, there\u2019s always a little cottage where you can go to and some peasants will hide you or keep you for the night, so instead you being outside in the frost, you\u2019re going to come into the village and stay there and get fed. Well, lots of partisans lost their life that way. I just didn\u2019t do that. There was always a bunch of guys who say, well, it\u2019s just too dangerous. So this idea of not necessarily staying comfortable, but doing the contrary thing is something which is not just Paul Strassmann, this 1s something, when you look at history of Jews -- I\u2019m just finished reading for the second time Paul Johnson\u2019s history of th -- of Jews. You know, when you say, well how did the Jews survive for, you know, whatever thousand years it was, you know, how did they move from -- from Sumer to Egypt to Canaan to Assyria to Babylon and back and forth. And then went to Persia, then went to -- to -- to -- to Damascus and to Anatolia. Th-The -- the wandering Jew. Well, the survival of the Jews was one that they always were ready to move. They would have stayed put, they would have died and perished like everybody else who stayed put. So this is not just a Paul Strassmann kind of an imprint, it\u2019s just deeply -- now whether it\u2019s genetic, I doubt, but it is, what do you call it, r-racial, or religious or psychological orientation. It\u2019s something that -- that very much has been a pattern of everything I\u2019ve done and how I\u2019ve progressed in the United States."

You were young, you were taking risks, but it\u2019s an interesting to -- way to -- to look at it, that it was in your blood, that it\u2019s part of the -- part of your heritage.

                " Yeah, in fact my son that I lost was very much interested in the subject, and -- and he was a brilliant, brilliant scholar at Harvard. And he always wanted to know, you know, what -- what makes it tick? You know? Give me an equation, you know, give -- give me something quantitative. Because you know, I always do things quantitatively. And I said, well, a-as you know, in -- in games theory and in mathematics, and in gaming, there are things called algorithms, okay? And so he wanted to know, what\u2019s the algorithm. And anythi -- in conversation with my son, then I said, you know, the -- the -- the algorithm in life is that you always want to migrate to where your number of options that you have, increase. So the algorithm is that if you are somewhere 1n what\u2019s called a mathematical sack, cul-de-sac, you\u2019re down to one option. And so in gaming theory -- this is called option theory, by the way, and by the way Van Neumann did a formal analysis of this [indecipherable] so -- so there\u2019s a mathematical basis for it. In gaming theory you have to look always for space, for more options, even if 1t costs you more, because once you have more options, even if the price is higher, the probability of you possibly doing better is greater than if you are what\u2019s called, in a zero sum game. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 \u00b0 Cul-de-sac, it\u2019s called -- in -- in mathematics, by the way, this is called a knapsack. I mean, there is formal theory over this thing. And my -- my second son Steven, who has a Ph.D. from M.I.T., he -- he -- he\u2019s a -- he\u2019s acclass one nerd, you know, mathematics, everything has to be quantitative. You know, one day I just on a napkin, drew for him this whole theory of life, that life is really of maximizing your options. That\u2019s what life is. In fact, when you look at the -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B ",
                " According to this theory of option, 1t means that if you stay hidden in a house of an employee whose wife is sort of a hostile party to this whole deal, you are basically cooped up and there\u2019s no options. I mean, you are just totally wedged in, and you have no place to go. When you are just in shorts, and with a t-shirt and sandals, and one sandwich, in the reeds of the river Vah, and going back two miles is that house, or going forward, actually swimming down the river and then going to the mountains where shooting takes place, that\u2019s more options.

            "answer": "Well, the tragedy was -- is that the -- my father greatly mistimed the whole issue of how we will survive. Ye -- we received, in 1942 at the end -- towards the end of the deportation, a presidential exception, which also covered the grandparents. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 a Grandfather Weiner was sent to concentration camp, but it was the Slovak concentration camp. The Slovaks kept some of the carpenters, and some of the Jewish craftsman to make furniture and artifacts for the Slovak new powers. So they kept a camp where the Jews were slave laborers, but they did -- were not shipped to- to -- to annihilation camps. So Grandfather Alexander was in a place called Novaky. We were in Trencin. My father, because of his prior connection with a very distinguished Catholic priest, by name of Bernetsky, really an outstanding friend of my father, secured a presidential protection, so that we were not deported in 1942. But we always knew that the day of reckoning will come when the front moves in from the east, and the Germans retreat. At that time, there will be wholesale destruction and annihilation and murder and who knows what happens. And so, starting in \u201943, we started rehearsing where do we go, where do we hide when the front moves. My father had set up a hiding place, and then a fall-back hiding place and a third place. In other words, there were like three places to go to. When the -- the beginning of the uprising, but it was not so full born yet, but when the guerilla attacks started -- it was precipitated, by the way, by the -- by the communists, for reasons which -- that\u2019s another story. We decided to go to back-up place number one, which was in a town called Selec, which is not too far from -- from Trencin, in the mountains. Was a small peasant village, there was peasant who was for money and my father already provided food and what have you, we\u2019re USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 \" going to go there. Well, when my father decided to -- to go to Selec, well then, there were other people who my father was obligated to. My father inherited from his partner, who I may or may not have mentioned, by name of Kubicek. Kubicek went to the Zionist congress in Basel in 1938 and never came back. My father took over custody of his wife and his son. So -- and there were two aunts, so my father took a truck from the business, loaded everybody and in we go into Selec to hide. Of course, the whole village saw that here comes a whole bunch of Jews, you know. It was just not well thought out. So we were there for two days, which was, I think August 27 and 28 and my father recognized this was really -- 1t was just too noisy, there were just too many people. And everybody was in the same place. So the decision was to go back to Trencin and regroup and start going into places where everybody will go in onesies or twosies --"

So that went on for about eight month or so. Then came an ordinance that you cannot live on that street altogether. So then we moved to another apartment, a one bedroom apartment. It was a very small living room, an upstairs walk-up, not too far from our original house. And we were there for maybe a year. Then an ordinance was passed that you cannot be even there, because it was ho -- it had hot and cold water. Jews cannot be in any apartment where there is both hot water and cold water.

This is an interview with Paul Strassmann, conducted by Margaret West, on January the 8, 2004, in New Canaan, Connecticut. This interview is part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\u2019s post-Holocaust interview project, and is a follow up interview to a USHMM videotaped interview conducted with Paul Strassmann on July the 11\", 1990. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape number two, side A. Did you ever go back and look at your old home?",
            "answer": "We -- I surely did. I -- my father\u2019s house on the main street, when I finished my officer course in 1945, in a military uniform and with a Tommy gun, I just walked in at two o\u2019clock in the morning, banged at the door. And of course it was occupied by the people who took over my father\u2019s business. They were absolutely petrified, you know, it was immediately after the war, and I was basically a political officer. You -- you must understand that when I got out of the partisans, I was considered to be an exceptionally reliable person to be used for whatever purpose, such as eth -- ethnic cleansing, you know, I was ready to do anything. And so I went back as soon as I could to find out if anybody was alive and of course they were petrified, they immediately moved out of the front -- front rooms of the house, to the back, where we used to live. And I stayed there one night. I wa-wanted no part of it, I found out USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 * nobody knew about anything about my family. All they knew that my mother was found shortly after she went into hiding and that nobody knew where my sister was, and everybody knew that my father was shipped to concentration camp right away. So -- so that was in \u201945, I immediately went there. Since then a v -- you know, under the communists, I couldn\u2019t go back. The -- it was shut down in 1948, when the communists took over. First time I went back to Trencin was in -- maybe in 1978 or \u201979. By that time the house was razed and a huge monster complex was built up as -- for Soviet kind of apartments. But I go there now at least once a year, sometimes twice a year. I just finished a very major project in Trencin, which may be of interest to you. When I went there in 1986, I went finally to the synagogue, which of course was converted into some kind of a music hall, but next to the synagogue was a small chapel, and everything was piled in, what that was left from the synagogue into the chapel. It was a warehou -- 1-it was a ma -- badly messed up closet, that\u2019s all 1t was, the benches were stacked up. And on the wall were the names of the Jews that perished. 1536 names. And they were just printed on pieces of paper that was curling and getting mildew. And there on the spot I decided that that is not going to be. And after four years of work, and getting people from all over the world to cooperate, last year we unveiled 24 bronze tablets with the names. I paid for it, just about all of it. And it is now a sanctuary. So I\u2019ve been back -- I mean, this idea of getting that memorial up into the -- into that chapel was very time USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 \u201c consuming. I must have made like 10 trips negotiating with various people. See, the Jews didn\u2019t want to have any part of it. They didn't want to stir trouble. So -- but finally I -- y-you know, it got very complicated. Nobody wanted any part of it, you know, why do you want to stir things up? Well, I stir things up."

So -- but ultimately, people came from Israel, and from Germany and Switzerland and England for the unveiling. I think they were more interested in talking to one another who survived, because they grew up all together. These are the survivors.

It was always a government town, it was a trading town. And so Jewish traders came and gone. That\u2019s why you have those large co -- concentration of Jews in Trencin. Because the Jews were basically the lawyers and the record keepers and the -- the -- the Hungarian and Austro-Hungarian nobility used Jews as their record keepers, as their bookkeepers. See, the [indecipherable] never wanted to be tainted by anything commercial. So they -- and they actually, as you know the history, they invited the Jews to come in to help them to manage Poland and -- and many of those countries, because the Jews were totally dependent on the nobility. And so there was a very large Jewish population and the Jews were being used as a money gatherer because the Jews really were, until about 1860 could not own land. So the Jews were used as instrument of feudal oppression and tax collection, which of course was one of the sources of anti-Semitism, which was deeply endemic in that part, particularly among the peasantry."

So there was a man by the name of Henry Kaiser, who used to make automobiles, who set up two assembly lines of making ships. They were called Liberty ships, they were sort of tack welded together. He made one ship every two days. And they were sort of tacky, and against all the code violations and what have you, but they brought the troops back and forth, brought them home. You know, the -- the Germans sank a few, but not too many. They went -- used to go in big convoys. And then in 1946, the relief for Europe, much of the grain went in Liberty ships. But by \u201948 those ships were just too small for that sort of thing, so they retired them down in the James River. I mean, there were -- I used to fly over the James River, there used to be couple of hundred Liberty ships tied up in James River. I say, which one did I come in on? They were all the same.

I mean, there was no -- not too many immigrants -- or emigrants from Europe, you know, because the visas were very hard to get, particularly immigration. But starting in \u201946 and \u00b047, lots of American college kids used to just go to Europe to -- just to see Europe, for whatever reasons. And that was the cheapest way how to get back. And many of them subsequently became quite famous. For instance, on the ship was Leonard Rose, who subsequently became a very famous cellist.

He climbed this tall USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 \u201c4 tree that we have here, this 50 foot tree, all the way to the top to see how far he can go.

And out of that node goes a number of options. One of the options is to do nothing. Another option, of course, not even know that you have a node. Now the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 \u00ae real game of life is that you have a node, which happens, and it happens to everybody. Now, of course, if you are in America, you have more nodes than if you are in the Soviet Union. I mean, this is -- this is part of the social context. In other words, you cannot say that a peasant 1n India a -- or in -- in Bangladesh has all his luck opportunities. Th -- you know they are -- the tragedy, they are all constrained in a world where there are no choices at all. But if you are in America and you happen to be moving 1n a given direction which seems to be evolving and where the options are continually opening -- in other words, if you are in -- in making buggy whips, you know, ther -- ye -- you know, you\u2019re th -- unless you do something else, you know, you just don\u2019t have those options. But the luck is there, it\u2019s always there. In America more so. And as you climb up on the chain of luck, which by the way looks -- gr-graphically it\u2019s represented at what\u2019s called a decision tree. I don\u2019t -- I mean, there\u2019s a formal branch of economics called decision trees. By the way, ma -- the first professional paper I ever wrote, that was published, was on so-called stocastic decision trees. Stocastic 1s probabilistic decision trees tr -- dec -- decision trees that branch out probabilistically. Which means at any given juncture you don\u2019t only have branches, one or two branches, but you have a whole spectrum. It\u2019s just -- just occurred to me I never mentioned it that way, but that -- coming back to the question of -- of luck, what you learn from Holocaust, coming back to the theme, is that certain things happen, or the -- what happened in 1944 is that I go where the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 m shooting is. I go up the mountain, I get a hand grenade, come down the mountain and there is bunch of Russian commando groups who just looking for somebody just like me to walk ahead of them, okay? Now that\u2019s stupid luck, okay? Now somebody else would say, well, you know, I\u2019m not going to go with the Russians. By the way, the guy who went with me, imme -- immediately wanted no part of it because the Russians were really a ragtag bunch of bandits. I mean, they were really a bunch of bandits. And I say, bandits, you know, this is fine, you know? Besides, they wanted me, you know. Besides, they gave me a rifle, you know? So luck happens and then you learn to -- to push it -- push it, as far as you can do. Now, in case of my son Eric, he pushed it too far. But, there you go. So -- so th -- that is the model, then.

Guess what, you\u2019re staying here and you\u2019re going to fix it. I said, well I\u2019m here for a consulting. No, you\u2019re coming -- you\u2019re staying here and fixing it. I say, well you cannot appoint me to a senior executive position in the federal government that easily. He said, you think I can\u2019t? So he said, well, will you take it? I say, well, you know, I am a servant of this country. If - if am asked to do something -- he says, just wait a moment, picks up the phone, brings in lawyers, what have you. I walk at 6:30 that evening with a badge, as the Chief Information Officer of NASA. Now, the question is luck, opportunity, or what, but there is a pattern. You know, I have many stories like that."

            "answer": "Oh, sure. My relationship with the Holocaust Museum goes back to perhaps as early as 1990 -- no, no, no, no, 1988, when -- 1988 when I gave a lecture at the Holocaust Museum on -- on the fact that the great lessons of the Slovak no -- uprising was the fact that a Jewish brigade at the labor camp, the slave labor camp, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 \u201d marched out as a bat -- armed battalion, as organized battalion and participated as a Jewish organized military unit, although the -- the Jewish brigade in the British army was organized in Tobruk in November of 1944, the Jewish brigade organized in Slovakia as a Jewish unit, goes back to August 29\", 1944. And I wanted to point out that -- that -- that unit, perhaps, is the first organized Jewish military unit that went to war since A.D. 70. There was some interest on the part of the Holocaust Museum, but in those days the Holocaust Museum was very much concerned about crying about the enormity of the crime, Holocaust. The idea of fighting, Jews fighting and opposing by action, the actions on the part of the Germans was not high on the agenda, except there was a -- a researcher in the -- in the -- the Holocaust Museum, a Dr. Sybil Milton, who got very much interested in the subject, and subsequently, when I was in Washington, I met with Dr. Milton several times, we had lunch together. And I tried to convey to you my sense of the Holocaust, namely that this was not necessary some evil maniac plot, but 1t was a historical evolution of a state machinery that went berserk. In other words, the Nazis and Hitler unleashed the power of the state to its ultimate form of destruction. You know, the state has always done pogroms and done injustice, and done all kinds of things, but here, the superiority of industrial organization and scientific organization, in fact, went to its ultimate conclusion, namely, we are just going to plan, methodically, to destroy people. And the enormity of the Holocaust really lies USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 \u201d in the fact that -- in its engineering. In other words, it was planned as an engineer could -- conscious process, where they were actually calculating the capacity of the cars, the capacity of the killing, how quickly can we burn them. In other words, they applied scientific management. And that is really the grossness, the horror of this thing, which I called the -- the bureaucratization of Holocaust. In other words, the bureaucratization of genocide. And the point that I was raising was that with advanced information technology, the state can, through control of people, and eliminating privacy in the future, basically grind masses of people to destruction. In other words, endemic in the structure of modern civilization, of industrialization, 1s a capability of massive destruction, by means out of anatomic weapons. Sybil Milton was very, very much taken by it. I then subsequently provided to the Holocaust Museum, a collection of documents which I assembled, my sister actually helped with it, which showed methodically how the various laws were used in Slovakia to gradually strip an innkeeper, who was a veteran from World War I, and who received special license to be an innkeeper and how that was taken away, and this was taken away and the fur coats was taken, and radio was taken, and so on, until you finally got rid of the innkeeper altogether and then gassed him. And I gave a collection of something like 30 documents, where the wife actually got a receipt for the husband. In other words, the bureaucracy worked with perfection and completeness and everything was legitimate and everything was signed and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 \"1 everything was covered by law. It was passed by a duly elected parliament. And then, of course, Sybil said, yeah, but where do computers come into this thing? And I said, well I don\u2019t know, but when I look at this succession of how Mr. Flak got eliminated, I can see a computerized society doing it much more efficiently, much more expeditiously, without any errors. Sybil then went away. A month later Sybil calls me up and say, I have something interesting for you. She sends to me in the mail, copies of three pages from some kind of German documentation, which shows a punch card, and shows a picture of what\u2019s called a Hollerith, Deutsche Hollerith machine, and says, could you tell me what it is? And -- and of course I said, surely, this 1s -- this is a machine that is being used, using census data in order to make sure that all the Jews and their property is properly filtered out so that you can schedule the Jews to destruction. And she said, you know, we are building a -- a Holocaust Museum, it\u2019s all crying and weeping, and what have you, but there\u2019s nothing in there about this concept of the grindstone of the bureaucracy actually being an engine of the Holocaust. And she said, you know, it would be very interesting to be able to prove that the Germans actually used computers in tabulating mach -- she didn\u2019t distinguish between tabulating machine and -- and I said, yeah, that would be very interesting. I took the picture and send it to a friend of mine who 1s a retired IBM executive. She said, oh we tried it before, we asked IBM whether they had anything to do with providing tabulating machine to the Nazis, you know. I said, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 \u201d Sybil, you must be kidding, you know. So I send it to this guy in Denver, he\u2019s retired, he looks at it, he says, oh, this is Dehomag number 325, you know. And yeah, the card says so and so Jew, and property and location and he\u2019s accounted for. So Sybil says, you know what, we really would need this kind of thing on the exhibit in order to make the point. Could you get the Nazi machine? I said, you must be kidding, you know, there\u2019s no such thing. Well, try anyway. So I sent out, because of my many connection -- you know, I am a collector, you know, you saw that --"

            "answer": "-- the Holocaust, at least the way I witnessed it, with the evidence available to me, although there were exceptions, particularly in the conquered lands, where in Russia, in -- where there was no legality at all, it was -- th-that was just plunder and mur-murder and what have you. But I\u2019m talking about western Europe, so-called civilized western Europe, which includes our good friends the French, and -- and -- and the Belgians, and the Germans and particularly the Austrian and the Slovaks, and the Hungarians and the Romanian, etcetera, etcetera, all did that in a very methodical, prescribed, legitimate method, which means that they could argue that they were proceeding through the sovereign rights of the state to take measures USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 \u00b0\u00b0 which they considered necessary to defend their social and economic well being. By the way, that argument has been made. Now, with that structure, and then harnessing the power of the state, they were then able to execute a crime in a very well structured method, which took advantage of all the best managerial know-how, such as being taught in schools today, of management. In fact, people get MBAs in subjects which are closely related to that, except they apply to cattle and apply to krispies, and hamburgers and what have you. Now, the evidence for this thing really is in what\u2019s called a transaction cost. The transaction costs for executing this crime were very low, because this was largely self funding. For instance, the Slovak paid the Germans, as you know, 10 marks for every body for resettlement and reeducation fees. The confiscations were self funding. Eichmann actually produced a profit and loss statement, because through the confiscation and so forth, they were able to get a large amount of gold into the coffers of their Reich system, although sooner or later the corruption crept in, but nevertheless, it was run as a business. The business was based on the fact that a very small number of people at corporate headquarters, with some enforcement, could take care of problems which involved the marshalling and destruction of millions of people. And one of the key elements in that process was the utilization of the Jewish organizations in co-opting the Jewish organizations into the liquidation process. The deportation lists from my town, Trencin, that I used to trace the authenticity of who was a victim or not, were USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 \u201d made by the Jewish [indecipherable], by the Jewish organization. The supervision and the guidance of, you know, going to this car, and going to this car, was done mostly by Jews with the enforcers onlooking except when there were some hooligans who did some stupid things, you know, like beat up people and so forth. But most of it was done in a fairly organized fashion. So now comes the Holocaust Museum, and you have a list of Holocaust survivors. And then you have a list of Holocaust survivor donors. And then you have interviews with these donors who are being awarded this or that, and being treated to this or that dinner. And then you have the Los Angeles chapter, and then you have the New York chapter, etcetera, etcetera. Well, these people get up and make a speech and they say how they suffered in Auschwitz, and in what have you. Now it turns out that none of them ever give away when they went to Auschwitz. None of them. They never do. This is one thing -- by the -- in many of my inquiries, and I will tell you some stories also how this [indecipherable] -- many of these people, by innuendo and implication esp- espe -- especially as to the date of the way, how the destruction was done, are clearly 1942 inmates.

Then you have the very interesting situation USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 \u201d in Indonesia. There is a whole taxonomy of different forms. There is a life form out there called genocide, that has a set of indicators which should be used as an way of alerting society, so that society can distinguish it. See, one of -- part of the problem with the genocide was that the society in \u201938 - \u00b039 did not discriminate, did not distinguish it, and the Jewish organizations were used as way of distorting and not clarifying what was really happening.

I-I wrote a paper and gave a series of lectures which were very 0 -- people were very unhappy about it. I pointed out that in 1944, the probability of surviving the eight month remaining for the remainder of the war, much greater if you fought than if you went to the concentration camp. In other words, there were two work camps in Slovakia, one in Sered, one in Novaky. The one in Novaky marched a battalion with a survival rate of 70 percent. Sered was done -- run by religious Jews. Well, maybe we\u2019ll negotiate our way, maybe it\u2019s not there, maybe we don\u2019t go on this transfer, maybe we\u2019ll go to the next transfer. Always bargaining. See, you were bargaining, see the -- you were bargaining with evil."

And so the probability, the morbidity rate of those was 95 percent. So you know, you\u2019re now dealing with statistics and with odds, and with orientation. You know, you had six million Jews with lots of money in 1938, let\u2019s go and take a hike. You know, we could have gone to Madagascar. We could have gone to all kinds of other places. Again, I am talking about the survival rates."
