            "answer": "It was fantastic. It was lik e in a movie which I never saw, we foresee that, and imagine, it was dark already. And in the light of the jeep you saw these Russians, not the, the Russian horses, small horses, these wagons coming back. They went back with little wagons and pulled us into Russia. They had taken this, and with them came the Russian Flea Ci rcus, who had been brought by the Germans to Russia to work there. And this Flea Circus had robbed the Germans of everything they could. I didn't mind that. There was the women, they are sitting next to the driver of the horses, and there are dressed in fantastic ways. They had stolen or robbed the Germans, the drapes, and sewed these gowns and they were wrapped into this, green and red and blue, shiny. It was unbelievable. And then it was again after we passed, it was pitch dark and we ran into a hole, there was a bump hole, and we came to a river where you couldn't cross, and so on. And this trip was unbelievable. Of course, for her it was the fi rst _______________. Where I said ________ __________. Sure now we got into American territory because she had no paper. I filled out, I had a paper that said she has been arrested as a ____________. An d as the ___________ beckoned, I changed the ______________, she sa t in some apartment with some German family wher e I arrived at night and we stayed all night until early in the morning I came and reported to the Major that I brought my wife back. He was horrified. It was a time where every contact with any lower citizen who was not American, with any lower citizen was strictly forbidden. It was very taboo. Which was idiotic because you couldn't speak to your parents who might still be alive. But he was horrified about it 60 and he was scion of the Philadelph ia, a very rich, very well known family. Th is was about all he was. And he called the headquarters of intelli gence, I assume, and said what had happened. Because earlier we were afraid of political complications with the Russians. And so he says, \"You proceed now to Batch-schwiber (ph), this is of course the military intelligence headquarters for Germany, and report there to so-and-so. And I took Laura (ph) into the jeep and instead of going to ____________, she was quite sick, she was, looked like a skeleton . And brought her to a hospital in ___________, Lisbon. Whic h disappointed her, and continued to Batch-schwiber (ph) and there I was seen by the General, who said, \"What is this, it is horrible what you did, Perl.\" I said, \"Yes I know. But you have to kno w the story.\" I told him the story and then he says, \"What should I do with you?\" I says, \"Sir, wait a moment. Sir, what would you have d one in my place?\" So he think for a second and he says, \"Hell I would have done th e same.\" And he said, \"I s it all right with you if I transfer you to another unit and out of milita ry intelligence because this is too much for intelligence. To another unit and take you off th e promotion list?\" There was a listing where I was to be promoted to First Lieutenant from Second Lieutenant. I said, \"Fine.\" I was promoted three weeks later. So I was then offered this, and I was then transferred to war crimes. You see, most people ridicule the army because they will send people in the wr ong spot. I was always in the military in the right spot. I was in intelligence when it was really important to be in intelligence. And when the war was over I was transferred to the war crimes, and I was from then on in war crimes until my discharge from the army in December, 1946."

            "answer": "I was transferred to war crimes and there was first used in a capa city of which I didn't speak so far. I have studied in Vienna of interest, out of interest, gr aphology, the interpretation of the formality from hand writing. This is based on very sound psychological principal that we express ourselves not only by words but in other ways too, among emotions, emotions. And hand writing is a product of emotions and the ___________ differentiat es changes to scroll copy into his own emotions, that tells us, should be ab le to interpreted as their emotional phase.

Somebody who is very depressed, the lines they will go up, ____________ will go up, down and up, and this is all in the simplest, not incorrect description because this is only one thing. You have to know psychology to put these traits all together. You can't build it on one trait. And I used this already in ______ ____ for the interpretation of handwriting of people who ha d to be interrogated, so that the interrogator gets a picture of the personality. I wrote an article about it and I will give you a reprint, but I have only four reprints left. ____________ me in the American Journal of Psychiatry. I have sent it to them. They are the most respected paper in the psychiatric profession, th ey are the official __________ of the American Psychiatric Association and usually you have to wait months or years for the publication of a paper if they accept it. It was accept ed and in two months it was printed. Now I did this first in war crimes, mainly to inform interrogators about the personality of the people whom they wanted to 63 interrogate. But then it became too boring for me. There was more action to be done. So I asked to be sent into the field. And I was sent into the field, which was then, the Germ ans had ________ down many flyers, and the flyers, those who survived, were mostly k illed by the population. They were beaten to death. And I was to go into villages that were there for intelligence and for information, the flyer has landed th ere, nothing was heard of him ag ain, to find out what happened to him and who did what.

He was killed. How was he killed? Beaten to death. No, he was shot, he was shot. I said , __________ beaten to death but this fl yer was shot. I said, who did it? So he said, so-and-so did it, he's a Po lish worker. I said, now I want to, I have to talk to him because I assumed that the Germans did it. And they pushed th is Polish worker in front , said he did it. So I had by then __________ there and the crime was admitted at the ___________, I had the name of the Polish worker. And the Polish worker, because it was shortly at the end of the war, was still there. And I said, bring him to me. And he came with a whole bunch of other Polish workers. And I asked him, you killed this young man? He said, I don't know their name but I'm thinking, but I had the right, I was entitled to kill him. I said, what gives you the right? And he showed me a, and he told me that he was very angry at this flyer, at the, wait a moment. No, he said a certain German had killed the flyer and he had killed the Germa n, this worker. The German who was done, who had done it, was known but he was not here. I didn't believe them. They said that the Pollack who shot him is here. So I got this Po le, and he told me, yes I shot him. I said, how did th is happen? He said, he was very bad to the Poles. He beat them and killed them and when the war was over, it was the first __________ village ca me in. I asked a youngster there and he ___________ ____________ leader for permission to kill this guy. And this is what I got, I got the permission to kill him, and he had a little slip of paper, _____________ _ paper with that, okay, kill the guy, so-and-so, Corporal so-and-so. First of all, he was not a Corporal, the p ilot first got the serial number. And with this he had acquired his authorization to shoot him and he shot him. But there were many places where the flyers were killed by the population. 64"

I am a scientist and an historian and I am interviewing you about the Warsaw ghetto and if he spoke to me, finally he says, don't speak to me, it's fine too. I couldn't get it.

Good-bye. Well, the firs t confession of Strope (ph) and it is in military style, he reports.

So I approached him, not with any ma rkings of rank, but with a Red Cross on my arm. As a Red Cross Officer who in quires whether he's all right or whether he is properly treated according to the Geneva Conven tion, whether there are any complaints, does he have enough food and enough working, he _________ _____. And th ere came the second time and third time, asked never any questions of military in terest. And then we discovered what he knew about and he was interested in musi c. We discovered that he is ve ry interested in ___________. So I said I'm very interested in ____ _______ too, let us talk about it ne xt time, I have to see somebody 68 else. And I read up ab out ____________ and the next time I came to him he was amazed how much I knew about ___ __________, about his brother Michael ______ ______ and so on. Those were contacts, you know? Of course, he didn't noti ce that I am Jewish. So I told him, listen, how do you see your future? He said, I don't know but I think that we still win th e war. I said, do you really believe this? He said, yes. I said, I tell you, I take you to the city and you can see for yourself, what was the _____________, what they did to London, because ______________ thought that London was half dest royed. And I spoke already with your commanding officer and he said, take him. He says, it's your business. You take him to the c ity. So I took him to the city, I took first his word of ho nor as an officer, I knew he would ne ver break it, that he wouldn't try to escape. I gave him a paper to have in case he trie s to escape, I didn't take a pistol along. And he went, ____________, I said, you tell the driver where you want to go . So he told the driver that he just wanted to go to Piccalilli Circus and ____________, well known places where there was hardly any destruction. I said, here, listen, there's hardly any destruction here. You stop and ask one of the passers-by where is the destruction and there I will bring you. And then you co mpare this to what's happened in Germany. So then he stopped and he asked not the first, only the second person who came by. Where is the best destru ction? He said, I thin k it was some Poles if I'm not mistaken, near some Poles. I said, have the driver drive to some Poles and there we saw so me destruction, a total of about five blocks, a few entirely destroyed. But no comparison to what they did in this. And he _________ back and on the way back there was, between Lon don and, what was the name, where we were stationed? __________ __? ______________? I forgot now, but I was stationed outside London. I mean it was a very secret _____________. End of Tape 4. 69 Tape 5 ",
                " And on the way back I stopped, we stopped at the little grocery stor e there. Before I bought, not Kosher salami but Hebrew Nati onal salami, it was not Kosher but the Kosher-type. And somebody had saw this, oh it was a _______ __ ___________ program and the Americans ha ve plenty of it and they sent plenty of it to Britain and the Britains di dn't like it because it smells of garlic and the garlic in it, so it was not rationed. So I said, on the way back we are going to pass by there, stop me, I want to buy some snack. And we stopped ther e. We went in and I sai d, I want this salami. And this I got and he said, no ___________ ? I said, no. He said, you know they tell us that everything is rationed and almost everything was rationed. Th is thing is _________ too. So now he was ___________ and the next ti me when I came to visit him, I don' t know whether it was the next time but I took time with this thing. I said, do you think now that you lost the war? He said, yes. Because you are in full strength and you are limping. The Air Fo rces don't exist anymore, the German, the Navy is practically not in existence. It was what you have in fighting. You have lost the war. So the first step, my firs t step was to convince him that he had lost th e war. Now came the second step. To convince him that if they lost th e war, the war is lost, the faster the war ends the better it is for Germany. Because every one of them yo u knew in quotation marks, \"____________________\" and for this you will need the Germans. So I ___________ on this, I said, I do not know but there is the possibility that _____________ develops with the Soviets and that we need the Germans, and anyhow we want to rebuild Germany, a Na zi-free Germany. And you might have some chance to get in to the ministry of naval affair s if you work with me for the reconstruction of Germany. I couldn't do this. I sai d, oh, if you can't do this, but I think it would be your patriotic duty to do it. So the next time I cam e out, the second time, he said, I am __________. I have to work with you for the reconstruction of Germany. Th at was the end. Because I was not a technician, I didn't know what abou t. He was then handed over to the people who asked them the questions they wanted to. And he was talking because he thought he would become a big shot in a new anti-Nazi German ______ ____ of naval affairs. "
