            "answer": "Well, our -- we -- our skiing company fought for about three weeks in southern Norway, then we had to give in, and I went back to Oslo. And then already some [indecipherable] I got the very bad pneumonia, but I got through it and the same month, more or less, July 1940, I met with some friends at the student\u2019s hut, out in the wilderness, north of Oslo. We started immediately think, what are we going to do? What can we do? It\u2019s now two -- 200,000 Germans here. Where can we start? But we thought we will start slowly, building up small groups. Maybe could be an invasion, and we hope for that. And -- but one thing was what -- very important, it was all rumors. The papers were censored, all the newspapers. Radios taken, so now it was all rumors. Anybody. It was rumors, rumors. So we thought you have to do something with this, you have to inform people. So then we started secret newspapers. It was about 350 newspapers in Oslo at that time, and I think it came up about at least so many secret newspapers, not with that circulation of course, but one of the newspaper had the circulation of 25,000. The newspaper what was that, we had -- the Norwegian [indecipherable] had put up a -- with BBC, the Norwegian broadcast to Norway, every evening, 7:30. And then these peop -- the news was taken down, that was news from the free world. It was no propaganda, it was -- we had got all the news from the free world. And they were put down, and they were magnified -- I mean, they were copied, and then you could have a sheet of paper, you could have 15, and you spread it round, very often where you were working, at your -- 1t was spread, and then the Germans propaganda and anti-propaganda was -- for them it was the worst thing. So Gestapo, it was the most terrible thing when -- if you are taken with the -- call it the clandestine newspaper, secretive, you would be arrested, and you could easily be shot. Or you were put into concentration camps. I think about 20,000 did this during the war, 5,000 are taken into custody, concentration camp, many, many died. And over 200 Norwegian journalists -- call it journalist, they were shot, why? Because they fought Nazism with pencil and paper. And they were shot, 200 of them are shot during the war, we hear about now. So it was just incredible how the -- and it was two things that -- that Gestapo was after, but I had a real Gestapo force in Norway, secret police, security police, they were after people doing these newspapers, and building up small military groups. And of course they were after other groups, and later on, of course, the Jews, which we -- which we couldn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t understand. We couldn\u2019t expect it at all, you know. They were Norwegians, they -- to me it was Norwegians, they had Norwegian passport, they lived in Norway, had -- they were born there. That we couldn\u2019t believe at all."

But when they were grown up, they were taken and of course when you had 20 people [indecipherable] you, 1t was seen by some traitors, some informers, they would inform on you. They had put up the same as they had in Germany. Security police and informers. You know, in any nation you would have one to two percent which are traitors to your country. And now they found them, and they were taken -- they had the- they were about 4,000 in Oslo. In -- over the two, three years, we had 4,000 informers. And when they saw man with the paper, they informed it to the Gestapo, and that man was tortured. And of course, he had been to a place getting it, and that was -- of course he -- you cannot stand the torture, it\u2019s impossible with the torture. They came to Norway with Middle Age torture. Middle Age torture, which I had read about, it 1 -- was history, and now they came into open with the Norwegian -- with the security police and they -- then they also organized, or reorganized Norwegian police. So they had about, I should say, 20 percent of them got taken into a new state, it was federal police, state police, and they were just teached -- taught by the Gestapo, so they were as good as any German Gestapo, any German security officer. So it was a very -- if you were in that, call it that trade, newspaper distribution, you would have a good chance to be arrested, tortured and killed. Was a very great risk. We all -- they all knew."

Then all the SOE sent in instructors from Great Britain to Norway, and it was a mixture there, it was a little difficult, because the Norwegian organization did one thing, and the groups from England did another thing. It was the Norwegian independent company number one. But then, together with Knut Moyen we could discuss this, and I could help him out. We were both a little unlucky because one of the people coming from England, he was arrested, he was tortured, and he became more or less an informer. Of course, this -- he was shot, he got shot right through the head, and [indecipherable] so it was terrible, but we are both a little unlucky there because many, many people, 200 people are arrested because of that instructor who was tortured. But otherwise, I took care of -- I was asked by my authorities to take care of all people come -- all agents coming in from England, from the -- coming around the central part of Norway, and I took care of them, that was part my job, so we could discuss this, and in the -- in a couple of years it was all coordinated. It was a little because the [indecipherable] thought I should built up with Norwegians alone, but they finally saw that some of the people inside Norway that built up the resistance, they were clever enough to let us -- so they could cooperate, but you know, you couldn\u2019t talk to each other in that way in Norway. I-I-It was all secret, you know. Communications with England was difficult, everything was difficult, but in two, three years, it was all coordinated within SOE, and the Norwegian authorities in England and also the home front people, the military central leadership in Oslo, it was all finally coordinated from I would say, 43, it started. And we had also a very good leader who was very clever, and th -- he was over to England a couple of times, which I was also, but he really was a good man, and he -- they understood in England that he was a -- quite a terribly clever fellow. He re -- he impressed them. That helped. And we had also, of course, Communists, which didn\u2019t agree in that kind of leadership. But I worked together with them, so when I met the man who fought the Germans, that was the important part, whatever he was. That was the important part for me, so I was lucky. Had a good cooperation with them, but legally on top, they would -- they would listen more, of course, to Stockholm, Moscow, than -- instead of to us. But they were not under Moscow, but to a certain extent they listened more to Moscow than London, which 1s -- was natural, you know. But it -- it worked fairly well in Norway."

Then I had a family called Rubinstein, and they -- they had a feeling that it was maybe worse than they thought, but the trouble was that if you left for Sweden, you lost everything. You were sure to lose everything. You lost your house, you lost the bank account, if you had any. If -- you lost everything, everything when you have left Norway. Your business was taken over by authorities, Nazi authorities. And if you didn\u2019t, then it was about -- I took the family over, and I think it was good idea, but we didn\u2019t feel that all sh -- all should be done, b -- because they had Norwegian passports. And then the rumors came -- I would say so very much, in October, \u201942, but then suddenly they went there, and the -- remember, the police had been organized, reorganized somehow, it was Nazi police. And then that night, 1t was -- now it was about 700 left, about eight, I would say, 1200 had come out to begin with, and later on it was taken over by the resistance the people had wanted. Every -- in those years, everyone that wanted to go out, could be helped. I could easily take a family over, I had their o -- a-as I told you, I knew the people, I could take easily. And I had no trouble going into Sweden. But then the 700 in all families, older people, young people, and -- and children, old people. And then the -- then one day, one o -- why- | heard it in this way, that one of my friends -- I knew a law -- a la -- a young lawyer, and his name was Hawkin [indecipherable] and he had a -- I didn\u2019t know he was a Jew, or anything, of course. I knew he had the passport, he had shown me that. Then he was a young lawyer, then suddenly, six o\u2019clock in the morning, I was to hear this, they came and they said, you are arrested because of the law so and so. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t know that law. I never heard about it.\u201d\u201d He was a good lawyer, and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s wrong, it must be wrong.\u201d So -- but then -- well, you have to come with us. Your bank account is now taken, you lose your house and have you any jewels here, we have to have them now. Everything. And he was so bewildered, of course, and then that- it was a shock to hear that new law, two days old, and the shock to hear he had no more things in life. They were all taken. And then he was taken away. I heard about this, and of course, then it started all -- all over Norway. A few were -- then, what happened to his wife, and a little daughter? Three days later, a man knocked at the door, five o\u2019clock in the morning, and they said get away, soon. And so she moved from the second floor, up to the third floor, to -- and the family said please come in here. Six o\u2019clock that morning the Gestapo came for her and her -- but she were -- they were saved. So many had --"

And sometimes you didn\u2019t hear any, but suddenly they were caught, it was an informer very often, and then they were taken to custody. First of all, to begin with they were tortured and they were sitting there in the prison.

Could be one that was taken and the whole -- and sometimes you could get -- arrest many who were tortured, and then they could give up, up to in one, two nights, and also it could have been almost 200 arrested. Some will be -- but most of them were taken into custody, and -- or -- or sent for new interrogations, and later on to Germany, to concentration camps to die. To work for two, three years and then off."

So it worked, but some Germans had seen it, but the -- they couldn\u2019t prove it, so the cook was a very good cook, so they said, well, forget about it. But my friend got a pill. When he understood that we had given up all hope, he then thought to himself, now I try to flee from here. And he really almost made it.

So I didn\u2019t put the key in the door, then I would just be shot, because there was some people waiting for me.

And he was very, very angry with the people sitting there, because I dis -- I just -- they didn\u2019t catch me. I -- I rang the bell. Then I would -- knew I would have a split second to think what to do. And the -- the door was thrown open -- open immediately and I -- there was a -- I got a pistol right in my face.

So we had to take a chance. Of course, we didn\u2019t know exactly how it was, but it could happen. So we met him in the evening, outside in Oslo, about eight o\u2019clock in the evening, very dark in winter.

One was a [indecipherable] manager in Shell company, and then -- but we -- we just didn\u2019t -- we had a feeling that he was not in the resistance movement, we had a -- the way he said it, then we understood that -- we were pretty sure that he was an informer.

But it was a concealed conscription for army, for German army. And the long week -- it was very hard to stop it, it was, of course that was sent over the radio, BBC radio, Norwegian broadcast to Norway, please don\u2019t go in there, don\u2019t -- don\u2019t report. But if they didn\u2019t report, they -- all the youth, 18 -- between 18 and 22, they would be fetched -- they would be taken by the police, would -- could be shot or put in a concentration camp. So it didn\u2019t help them to refuse. But in Oslo they were supposed to meet 3,000 in \u00b044, spring 44, 19\" May, they were supposed to meet. 18\", the day before, I was asked -- it was my first job, I was asked to -- they ene -- in the evening, same evening, blow up the office, and it was in -- in Norway it\u2019s very light in May, it\u2019s -- almost all night. So about eight o\u2019clock in the evening we went up there, and had a -- some explosives, 14 pounds of explosives. And then we just -- in a small parcel. And then th -- we thought it was very easy to do this, but it was about 20 people working overtime, because they should have 3,000 people next morning. So I said to my friend, I cannot kill these people, I don\u2019t -- we cannot do that, that\u2019s not our job. Our job 1s to ruin it. So I shouted -- went up to -- in the house, and I shouted as high as I could, get the hell out of there. Two minutes the house will be -- the whole thing will be blown up. And they all got out in a split second, more or less. All of them. And when we came out, it was only less than one minute before it exploded, so -- then the next morning, nobody could meet there. I had a feeling that the -- I\u2019d heard from some historians that three people went instead of 3,000. And they had troubles because the stairs wasn\u2019t there any more. So we were lucky. And this helped. Next day they knew three -- 3,000 should meet, but they had no place to meet. So that was start, we made several sabotage operations s-so we could help this, and it was stopped, finally. After six months, they gave up. So we -- we sent a ti -- sent in 5,000 youngsters [indecipherable] means quite a lot to people [indecipherable] three million. Quite a big percentage."

They could sort out things on new machines from the States. And it was, of course, the company that had this, that was IBM. At that time in Norway, it had another name, the company, and they had these machines. And these machines were now put in to sort out people to find the addresses. They were sorted like anything 1s. It was a first kind of data -- data machine, I think, data. And then the Germans and the Norwegian -- the Nazi government, they wanted to use this. I got the order to take it, to destroy it before they could start. So the first- the machines, they were -- they were in a nice shop in Oslo, and one morning we heard that it - they will be taken over by the Gestapo. So the day before, we came there, and we had a big stone through the window, and had three small charges of -- of explosives, and there were no more after a minute. Then we disappeared completely. The next day they -- we had forgotten a big machine up in the insurance company. And then we had got the new order to go up there and take that. And then they had put four guards around the machine with a police dog. Now they were sure it will not be taken, and the Gestapo and the -- they were hundred percent sure nobody could come there. So it was impossible, but we found a new way. If it had been now we would have maybe used a helicopter, but you didn\u2019t have helicopter at that time, so we had to crawl over three, four roofs, until we reached that building and got down there, and the -- there we knew it was -- the machine was under the -- the dining room, or the room where the fella -- the employees had their meal. And during the night we came, we reached it, and put the explosive, that would 10 -- it was a delayed bomb, 10 minutes, and then we went back, we -- if you then went into the streets about 10:30, you would be taken, it was German guard all over town during the night. Also because of these sabotage operations. If we came into the street, we would be arrested immediately, our age. So we wen-went into the next building and had a fine view to where the explosion will go off and 10 minutes afterwards, again we -- we didn\u2019t want to take lives, so we called them again on the telephone, we said, two minutes, you\u2019d better get out. And they knew from experience now, so they all got out, even with the dog, and then it was blown up, the whole thing. And next morning they couldn\u2019t find anybody, no track whatsoever, which was a very important thing. We didn\u2019t lose people, I didn\u2019t lose any of my men, and it was a -- should called a success."

Of course it was wonderful for them to hear about it, and when I came the next day, I went down in the district and talked to people and they said, oh, terrible people that\u2019s done this.

And then we went in there and then went into the German part in the basement, through three fences, and put down about 300 pounds of dynamite. We blew up the whole place. And I think it wasn\u2019t very nice for them to use their spare parts in Norway. And the same had to be done with ball bearing. Ball bearing was terribly important for any nation. And Swedish -- Sweden had the best ball bearings in the world, you know, they had also a small place in Oslo, which was also blown up. Another thing what -- how -- how would we know what to -- what take, of course, when we talk about submarines. Submarines use batteries. Submarines batteries, that means sulfur, the acid. And we had two of them in Norway, so the way we could hit the submarine weapon to stop the submarines was to ruin these two acid factories, and they were stopped. So they couldn\u2019t produce any more, they were ruined for the rest of the war, and then it was not -- very few batteries coming from Norway to -- norw -- to submarines, because at the coastline in Norway, during the war you could hide every nation\u2019s fleet, submarines and everything, in Norwegian fjords. You could have the whole -- the world could be placed into Norwegian fjords. And they did, of course, all those submarines, they disappeared in Norwegian fjords. So they were -- it was very important to hit them in a way of taking away sulfur, as in for batteries. Then you had to have experts to help you [indecipherable]. But when we talked about Haugland, he was also wireless operator on the heavy water operation, and on my hometown. And so he had a [indecipherable] experience. Two s-s-small town -- two small town boys were also there."
