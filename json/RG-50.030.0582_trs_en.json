So they directed us to go into the town, it\u2019s called Wels. Wels, it\u2019s 30 kil \u2014 30 kilometers or less than Linz \u2014 from Linz. So we all went into that town, I don\u2019t know how many thousands of people, but a day later \u2014 we slept outside, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Ernie Pollak \u201d March 2, 2010 because there is no place where to sleep. A day later and two days later and three days later, we were still walking around [indecipherable], but the Americans came with their Jeeps and grabbed us, put us in in the Jeep and brought us to Wels, because Wels had room for thousands of people because it was an SS camp, officers\u2019 camp. And everything was empty, so they brought us there, you know. So we are there and they didn\u2019t know how to feed us, so they gave us too much food.
