So the kapo going in and out, several kapos , knock on doors \u0152 on ther e. They didn\u2122t know what happened. So I don\u2122t know , at 10 o\u2122clock or 11 o\u2122clock [indecipherable] people looked out, they didn\u2122t see any Germans in the uniforms, they didn\u2122t see any be \u0152 if they saw a German he was running this way, you know. So they came in and told everybody, something is wrong, some thing is going on, yo u know. But by two o\u2122clock, you know, the kapo came in, says the German left because the Americans are coming. But we have to wait til the Americans are going to come here, because yo-you don\u2122t know where the Germans ar e now. They are not here. If you go out now, you might find a German who can do harm to you. So we were in there, but some people, older people, younger people \u0152 I was too weak and too young to s \u0152 to Interview with Ernie Pollak March 2, 2010 28\u0152 to think, went out from the \u0152 from the \u0152 from the barracks, and they went to the \u0152 where they had the food that \u0152 you know \u0152 a nd started to open up the stores there, whatever they have sas \u0152 and they starte d to bring it into the camp, you know. The reason why I remember these things, I was t oo weak to go there, so I stood by the door \u0152 my wife, I used to tell her that story, and this was a funny thing, what happened. I see one fellow, maybe a little older, a year or two than I, which I never knew him, comes in with \u0152 with somethin g in his hands like this, a jar like, you know. A2: Honey. ",

But I had some honey, and \u0152 and starte d eating. And then I didn\u2122t see him again, we didn\u2122t \u0152 no, we didn\u2122t. But \u0152 I\u2122ll tell this later on. So by f \u0152 I think it was around four o\u2122clock, was no \u0152 who had watches, but we just looked at \u0152 was around four o\u2122clock that the Americans came in. And they opened the door, so they says, you can go any place you want. So where do you go from d \u0152 you don\u2122t know \u0152 nobody knew where. So they directed us to go into the town, it\u2122s called Wels. Wels, it\u2122s 30 kil \u0152 30 kilometers or less than Linz \u0152 from Linz. So we all went into that town, I don\u2122t know how many thousands of people, but a day later \u0152 we slept outside, Interview with Ernie Pollak March 2, 2010 29because there is no place where to sleep. A day later and two days later and three days later, we were still walking around [indecipherable] , but the Americans came with their Jeeps and grabbed us, put us in in the Jeep and brought us to Wels, because Wels had room for thousands of people because it was an SS camp, officers\u2122 camp. And everything was empty, so they brought us there, you know. So we are there and they didn\u2122t know how to feed us, so they gave us too much food. A few days later, I je \u0152 I remember on a Sunday morning, hundreds of people were laying outside hardly breathing because th eir stomachs swelled up, you know. And \u0152 an-and I found right there, some of my \u0152 some \u0152 two people from my hometown laying there. "
