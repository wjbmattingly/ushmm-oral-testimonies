Thank you for\njoining us. We are in our 14th year of the First Person program. Ow First Person today is Mr. Leon\nMerrick, whom we shall meet shortly. This 2013 season of First Person is made possible through the\ngenerosity of the Louis Franklin Smith Foundation, to whom we are grateful for again sponsoring First\nPerson. |'m very pleased to tell you that Mr. Louis Smith is with us today.\n[Applause]\nThank you, Louis.\nFirst Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share with\nus their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each of our First Person guests\nserves as a volunteer here at this museum. We will have a First Person program each Wednesday\nand Thursday until the middle of August. The museum's website at www.ushmm.org provides\ninformation about each of our upcoming First Person guests.\nLeon Merrick will share with us his First Person account of his experience during the Holocaust\nand as a survivor, for about 45 minutes. If we have time at the end of the program, we'll have an\nopportunity for you to ask a few questions of Leon.\nThe life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about to hear\nfrom Leon is one individual's account of the Holocaust.\nWe have prepared a brief slide presentation to help with his introduction. We begin with this\nphotograph of Leon Merrick, who was born Leon Kusmirek on January 8, 1926 in Zgierz, Poland.\nAfter the Nazis attacked Poland in September 1939, Zgierz Jews were moved to Lodz, Poland. The\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,\narrow on this map of Poland points to Lodz.\nThe Lodz ghetto was formed in February 1940. Over 100,000 Jews were forced into less than\ntwo square miles of neglected neighborhoods in the northern end of the city. In the ghetto, Leon\nworked for the postal service, delivering letters, milk and ration cards. This photo shows members of\nthe ghetto postal service. Leon is in the third row, and he is right here, second from the left. So\nhopefully you can see where he is based on the arrow.\nOne of Lodz's main streets passed through the ghetto and was kept open for non-Jewish\ncommerce. So the Jews who lived in the ghetto had to cross that street on bridges like this one.\nIn 1944, Leon was taken to a forced labor camp in Kielce, Poland. From there he was\nevacuated to the Buchenwald concentration camp. The arrow on this map of major Nazi camps in\nEurope points to Buchenwald.\nThree months later, Leon was sent to the Flossenburg concentration camp. This arrow on the\nmap points to Flossenburg. From there he was sent on a death march. Leon was liberated by US\nForces in April 1945. We close our slide presentation with this photo of Leon posing with friends soon\nafter liberation. Leon is on the far right.\nAfter the war, Leon worked for the US Army in Germany before coming to the United States in\n1949. With the $23 that he received upon arrival, he made a new life in Washington, DC. He was\ndrafted into the US Army during the Korean War. Eventually, Leon opened his own restaurant that he\nran for a quarter century. Given its closeness to the White House, it was a popular place, especially\nwith the Secret Service who gave him a party when he retired.\nSince his retirement in 1993, Leon and his wife Nina have remained in the Washington area.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nLeon is a volunteer with the museum's Visitor Services. You will find him here every other Saturday.\nHe is also active with the Jewish war veterans. In 2011, Leon was one of five survivors liberated by\nthe US Army asked to lay a memorial wreath at the World War Il Memorial on the DC Mall.\nNina, who fought with the partisans in World War II, continues to work as a Hebrew teacher. |\nwould like you to know that Nina is here with Leon today, as is their daughter, Marsha. Right here.\n[Applause]\nLeon and Nina have two daughters. They lost their daughter Mira at age 27 due to a rare liver\ndisorder, 27 years ago. Mira was an artist. Marsha is an MSW social worker and the mother of Leon\nand Nina's two grandchildren. Their granddaughter is a graduate of Drexel University in Philadelphia\nwith a degree in computer science, now working in the San Francisco area, as well as a degree in\nengineering. While in college, she taught English in India. Their grandson also is in the computer\nworld, and he lives in Israel.\nWith that, | would like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Mr. Leon Merrick.\n[Applause]\nLeon, thank you for joining us and for being so willing to spend an hour with us as our First Person\ntoday. We can't possibly do justice to what you could share with us in an hour, but we'll do the best\nthat we can. We'll start right off as soon as right now.\nYou were not quite 14 years of age when Germany attacked Poland in September 1939.\nBefore we talk about the events once the war began, start first by telling us a little about your family\nand your community and yourself in those years before the war.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\n>> Leon Merrick: OK. | was living in a small city, the city of Lodz. The population was 29,000. 3,000\nJewish families. My father was employed in the textile business. | had a younger brother, three\nyears younger. My mother was a housewife. So the war broke out September 1, 1939. The\nGermans came into our hometown September 7, only seven days later. Right away, in Europe you\nstart school in September, just like in the United States, like everywhere, but we couldn't go back to\nschool. My father lost his job. He couldn't go back to the factory.\nNot long afterwards, an announcement came out by word of mouth that all of the Jews in the\ncity had to report to the main market square. So we didn't Know what to do. My parents thought,\nShould we take clothes with us, foods with us, are they going to let us come back home? Should we\ntake my younger brother with us or leave him with our Polish neighbors?\nWe decided to go as a family to the market square. We walked, we sat down on the\ncobblestones, maybe an hour or so, a guy came out, he announced this place is to be Jew-free. He\ngave us three days to leave. So we couldn't take any furniture. We took it to our Polish neighbors. It\nwas the later part of September. We knew that England, France declared war on Germany, and we\nthought two big powers, Germany won't last long, we'd be able to come back.\nAnyway, we called the neighbors, told them they could have our furniture. Another neighbor\nhad the horse and the wagon. We packed up belongings, mostly clothes. We didn't take any\nfurniture. And we went to the city of Lodz.\n>> Bill Benson: When you gave the furniture to the Christian neighbor, you thought you'd be back?\n>> Leon Merrick: With the understanding, when the war is over, we're going to take it back. Didn't\nhappen like that.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nMy mother had the sister in the next city, Lodz, L-o-d-z, about 10, 15 miles away. We walked\nalongside the wagon. We walked. Came to the city. We moved in with my aunt. A family of four,\nwe're a family of four. We slept on the floor for six, seven weeks. While we were there, they\nannounced they're going to form a ghetto in the city of Lodz.\n>> Bill Benson: Before you tell us about the ghetto, a couple questions for you. Were all the\nresidents of your town, Zgierz, were they all sent to Lodz? Did everybody go?\n>> Leon Merrick: No. At that time, they announced that the place has to be Jew-free, everybody\nwent his own way, wherever they had relatives. Some entered the city of Warsaw. At one time, my\nparents were talking about going to the city of Warsaw. My mother had a cousin. There is a tin\nfactory. Maybe we'll be safe with him. We're lucky we didn't go to Warsaw. We went to the next city,\nLodz.\n>> Bill Benson: Did you have family in Lodz?\n>> Leon Merrick: My mother's sister. Maybe her cousins, aunts, my father's sister, all living in Lodz.\nOK, we went to the ghetto, and then hunger started setting in. Everybody was hungry. The\nJews started organizing as best they could. So they opened factories, and they had a lot of\ntradesmen, had shoe factories and tailor factories, we're going to produce material for the Germans,\nmaybe send in more food or maybe they'll leave us alone. So everybody had to work, and it was\nimportant to work because in a place of employment you got an extra bowl of soup. My father knew,\nso he got a job as an orderly in the main hospital.\n>> Bill Benson: The hospital in the ghetto?\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\n>> Leon Merrick: In the ghetto. My mother got a job in the orphanage. She got a bowl of soup there.\n| notice young people going around with satchels, delivering mail. | said to my parents, Maybe | can\ndo a job like this. If | wasn't going to school, Jews were not allowed to go to school. My father talked\nto somebody, he told him, Write a petition.\nHe wrote a letter, | have a young son, at that time | was already 16 years old. | was\ncalled to the personnel office. | noticed in the petition that the letter which he wrote a big R initial by\nthe head of the ghetto. | got a job, so | got extra bowl of soup.\n>> Bill Benson: When you first told me you worked for the postal service, | was sort of flabbergasted\nthere was a postal service in the ghetto, because | wouldn't have thought mail could go in and out.\nTell us what the postal service did and why there was mail.\n>> Leon Merrick: OK. Talking about 1940. The first months of 1940. There was a post office, a\nworking post office. You had a lot of Jews from the city of Lodz where | was born. They went to the\nSoviet occupied zone. At that time, if you Know, Germany made a nonaggression pact with the\nGermans, and with the Soviet --\n>> Bill Benson: They were Allies?\n>> Leon Merrick: So we had mail. Then at that time, it's before the Germans overrun France and\nBelgium, the Benelux countries. Aside from that, when they formed the ghetto, the Germans picked\nthe most dilapidated section, rat infested, bedbugs. You had some Jews intermarriaged to non-Jews.\nThe other partners decided to come into the ghetto too, to be with the spouses. Definitely outside\nthey sent mail and packages, things like that.\n>> Bill Benson: For a while --\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\n>> Leon Merrick: Yeah, and from South America, all these neutral countries. They didn't declare war\non Germany. We had a working post office.\n>> Bill Benson: You just told us having a job was so important in terms of getting that extra bowl of\nsoup. Your brother though was too young to work, right?\n>> Leon Merrick: My brother was too young to work, so we had to share with him. You get a little\nmore, extra bowl of soup, so he got an extra -- but later he got a job too. Later on, he got a job too.\n>> Bill Benson: | think you told me that at one point there were almost 160,000 Jews compressed\ninto this two square mile area with over 90 factories producing goods for the Germans.\n>> Leon Merrick: Less than two square miles.\n>> Bill Benson: Eventually, | think you said, more than 200,000 would pass through there?\n>> Leon Merrick: Once the Germans overrun the countries in Europe, the Benelux countries,\nHolland, Belgium, Luxembourg, they rounded up the Jews in the center, the Benelux countries, the\ncenter, the Lodz ghetto, it was an assembly point for the time being, until they decided to do away\nwith the Jews.\nThey were taking out transport from the ghetto all the time. In 1942, the Germans ordered the\ncurfew. Nobody could go in. You had to stay. Nobody could go into the houses. The Germans went\nfrom house to house, they blocked off the streets. Everybody had to come to the courtyards, but if\nthere was no courtyard come to the street, and you stood there. | could see the women putting on\nthe rouge to look healthy. At that time, they took away 15,000 children from the ghetto, and elderly.\n>> Bill Benson: 15,000 children and elderly.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\n>> Leon Merrick: They took them to an assembly point, but we didn't Know. For the first time | heard\nabout the gas chambers in 1942. | was working in the post office. | was sitting there, somebody told\nthe story what he heard. | don't know where, but he said he heard it, they take the people, the\npeople, they took from the ghetto. Give them a towel, piece of soap, they go to the showers and\ninstead of water gas is coming out. | didn't think anything about it. | didn't believe it. That's what they\nsaid.\nLater, in 1943, they had a Catholic church in the ghetto and it was padlocked. 1943, they\nopened the padlocks, the Germans opened the padlocks, they were bringing clothes to the ghetto.\nThey took the local Jews to sort out the clothes. Sometimes a letter fell out, or ID fell out. We know\nthose are the ID cards from the people who just left the ghetto. Some clothes were bloodied. The\nGermans took the Jews to sort it out, and then the good clothes to send to Germany.\n>> Bill Benson: Leon, hunger was so ever present, and you told me that sometimes people would be\nable to get a prescription from a doctor within the ghetto for potato peels.\n>> Leon Merrick: Yeah. The hunger was so bad, and people lost weight, and they got sick, you\nknow. They went to the doctor, if you know a friendly doctor, he wrote you prescription for potato\npeels, because they had community kitchens. We had, you got the one soup a day. The women\nused to find out which kitchen peels the potatoes thick, so they went to the kitchen, you wash them\nout, took out the dirt, there wasn't much left.\nAs a matter of fact, | saw an accident, somebody came out from the kitchen with a pack of\nsoup, collected for his family, then all of a sudden a boy jumped the women. It was a big tussle.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,\nWhat happened? The bowl fell, the soup spilled. On the sidewalks. The boy just spreads out, and\nlicks up the soup, whatever was left, on the sidewalk. Hard to believe, isn't it?\n>> Bill Benson: Leon, once the deportations began, in 1943, and of course the Soviets and the\nGermans became enemies and the mail service stopped, what was your role primarily after that time\nin the postal service?\n>> Leon Merrick: Well, we were delivering -- OK, so from the beginning of the ghetto the Germans\nrequested able-bodied men to work for Germany. | remember young men, we had neighbors, get up\nearly, 4:00, 5:00 in the morning, they had the German medical commission, and they're looking if\nthey're healthy, and the Jewish community somehow they paid the families in German scrip money.\nThey had their own money. So we were delivering that. Then we were delivering notices to report to\nthe town square. The Germans always demanded people. They had to feed the extermination camp.\nYou had the camps, whatever it is, so we delivered the notices to report for work, for the assembly\npoints.\n>> Bill Benson: You're now delivering notices?\n>> Leon Merrick: Notices. For example, I'll give you an example. It's wintertime, cold outside. |\nhave a notice to somebody going to European houses, you had the building, go into the hallway, and\n| have a certain names and address. | knock on the door, nobody answers. | heard a faint voice from\nbehind the curtain, because if the door was, now it's a curtain, because the people took out the\nwooden door for firewood. There is a curtain there, | hear a faint voice. | put the curtain aside. |\nmake my way through and the curtain is stuck. | could see icicles falling down. | stick my head in, |\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\ngo inside, what do you know -- they're all laying in the beds. No need to get out. They have no jobs.\nThey're hungry. Nothing to look forward to. And | didn't have good news for them.\n>> Bill Benson: Leon, your mother, as you said, got a job in the orphanage. What happened to her\njob?\n>> Leon Merrick: In 1942 also, my father -- I'm going back. My father worked in the hospital, and the\nGermans came and rounded up, took all the patients out. Then they went to the orphanage where\nmy mother used to work, took all of the children out. So my mother had no job there. We didn't\nknow. The rumor was going around, they take the sick people to sanatorium or the kids to send to\nschool. We know now where they took them, they took them all to the gas chamber, killed them all.\n>> Bill Benson: You would exist in the Lodz ghetto for about four years.\n>> Leon Merrick: Yes, 1944.\n>> Bill Benson: Tell us about the circumstances that led to your removal from the Lodz ghetto and\nwhere you went from there.\n>> Leon Merrick: In 1944, my job wasn't essential. At that time, because the ghetto started up with\n161,000 people, then they bring in more people, at one time or another, 200,000 people in the ghetto.\nNow they were emptying the ghetto. In 1944, the ghetto only had 78,000 people. | got a notice to\nreport for a transport. 1944, | was 17 years old, and so at that time the Soviets already chased the\nGermans back from Stalingrad, the Russians, the Soviets are coming closer to our borders. Maybe\none of these days we're going to be liberated by the red army. | didn't report for the transport. | was\nhiding.\nThen they took my ration card away. Whatever was left over, my father didn't have the job in\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nthe hospital anymore, my mother didn't get the extra bowl of soup, so maybe my parents talk to other\npeople, What should we do? They said, Well, the boy is 17 years old. They're not going to kill him.\nMaybe they only want him for work.\nMy mother packed up a rucksack, sweater, extra pants, underwear, extra socks, and | reported\nto assembly point. | reported to the assembly point, and | got there, | see people hurting themselves.\nThey didn't want to go in the transports. They're walking around to wires, puncturing your eardrums.\nlf you have no hearing, how can you go to work? Somebody cutting themselves, maybe making a\nhernia. How are you going to lift things? You're supposed to go to work.\nAnyway, after three, four days, they march us to the train station. | had my rucksack. | put this\nin the cattle cars. Closed the trains.\n>> Bill Benson: Before you go on, did you get to say goodbye to your parents?\n>> Leon Merrick: Sure, when | left the house, | said goodbye. Then my father came to see me one\nmore time. | was already behind barbed wire. From far away. It was March 1944. Still cold in\nPoland. You had a 3/4 pea jacket, high boots, | had earmuffs. That's the last time | have seen him.\nDon't even have a picture of my family. | don't. Whatever | remember the last time | saw them\nit's printed in my mind. No picture of my mother, my father, my younger brother.\n>> Bill Benson: They locked you in the transport?\n>> Leon Merrick: Locked me in the transport. After riding several hours, train stopped, opened up,\nwe came out, guards were waiting there. They told us to climb the tracks. | had this rucksack. | said,\n\"What about this?\"\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\n\"It will follow later.\"\n| never seen it. Whatever | had on me, that's it. They took us to a camp.\n>> Bill Benson: You had on you some pictures, right?\n>> Leon Merrick: At that time | had everything, pictures, letters, addresses from relatives. My mother\nhad a sister in France, cousins in Holland. After the war we'd meet. All in my pockets.\n>> Bill Benson: Their addresses?\n>> Leon Merrick: Everything, sure. So we got to this camp, they didn't give me the rucksack. They\ntook us to the camp. There were already Jews in the camp. The next morning, they marched us\nunder guard to work, to the factory nearby. OK? We came in contact with non-Jews over there. We\nJews, we came under guard every day, worked in the factory. When the shift was over, they\nmarched us back under guard. The non-Jews went back to their home. We know what was going\non. A lot of people were dreading, if you had a nice sweater, socks, extra pants, a guy can bring you\na loaf of bread. | had nothing to trade. They didn't give me rucksack back.\nWhile in this camp, | heard about the Normandy invasion, June 1944. | heard about the\ninvasion, the Allies invasion of France.\n>> Bill Benson: How did you hear about that?\n>> Leon Merrick: They came together with the Poles. The non-Jews. They heard on the radio. In\nthis camp, at that point, it was going back for the Germans, Soviets and the Russians, whatever you\ncall them, they're coming closer to the camp. The guards come one morning, they said pack up. |\nhad nothing to pack up. They took us to the train station, in open cattle cars. After riding two, three\nhours, they stop, load us up on tracks, tracks move forward. Still in Poland. Took us to the market\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ;\nsquare. The place was swarming with Germans. All kind of uniforms, military men. They came to\nthe tracks, and they asked, \"Who are you people?\" We told them, \"We're Jews.\"\n\"You're Jews? You're here to help us win the war?\"\nWhat do we tell them? Keep your mouth shut. Told them nothing.\nThe next morning, they took us out to the countryside, they gave us picks and shovels, and we\nhad to dig ditches against advancing Soviet Army. The German engineering, OK, we worked there\nfor a while. We asked the guards, \"What's going to happen when digging ditches is done?\" How long\ncan you dig ditches? The guard shrugged the shoulders. We asked, \"Why can't you take us back to\nthe ghetto we just came from?\" They told us the ghetto is being liquidated. This in July.\nWe finished digging, they took us to another camp in Poland. We worked in the factory\nanother couple months. The same as the previous factory, making boots for the German army.\nLike | mentioned, the war was going back for the Germans. The guards came one day, \"Pack\nup, on the double, to the train station.\" They marched us to the train station. We can hear the local\npopulation, they were running \"The Russians are coming!\" In Polish, of course. We're from Poland;\nwe understood it. But we'd been under guard.\nThey locked us up in cattle cars. We didn't know where they were taking us. We just had a\nsmall window with barbed wire. We lift up, once the train stops moving, and they could read German\nnames. | remember going to Germany. We didn't know exactly where we're going to.\n>> Bill Benson: The names of German cities as you were going by?\n>> Leon Merrick: Right. We could hear the whistle blowing, people going into factories. Once ina\nwhile the train stopped, because it's war, they had to let others through. You could hear children's\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nvoices, people going to factories, with their lunchboxes. Here I'm 17 years old, locked up in a cattle\ncar only because I'm a Jew, nothing else.\nAnyway, after riding about eight days, the cattle car stopped, opened the door, sun. The sun\nhit us in the eyes. My eyes got clear, | took a good look, | can read \"Concentration Camp\nBuchenwald.\" | know exactly where | was. | see the Nazi flag flying. After five minutes or he so, the\nguards came out, \"On the double, line up, column of five.\" They march us to the main gate, which is\na familiar sign, \"Work makes you free.\" | didn't get free yet.\nWe're in the big hallway, the hallway was this big thing. Everybody undress, put everything on\nthe table. At that time, | had addresses, pictures of my family. Once | put everything on the table,\nwhatever | remembered, no pictures, everything on the table, | stood naked, and | told you guys, they\ndidn't give us clothing. | worked in the factory, the machines, running oil. | developed blisters on my\ncalves.\n>> Bill Benson: From the oil from the machines?\n>> Leon Merrick: From the oil from the machines. | could wash out my pants, but the same thing\nhappened right away. All of a sudden, I'm naked, tall guy, swastika, black hat, must be a big SS man\nin the camp. He points to my thighs. In the best German | could, | told him, | had no change of\nclothing, no aprons, | worked in the factory. He stood there, shook his head, walked away.\n>> Bill Benson: He could have decided --\n>> Leon Merrick: He could decide to do whatever he wanted with me. | don't know. He could give\nme a paddle shot, who knows. It's 1944. He just took a look, shook his head, walked away.\n| was still healthy to work.

They shaved our head,\nunderneath the arms, everywhere. They were inmates like | was, but they already had a job in the\ncamp. We were the new arrivals.\nAfter this was finished, they led us into another room, and they had the big basin, looks like\ndisinfecting water, like pool water. We had to submerge. Don't forget my blisters here. | submerged,\nit was burning like the devil.\n| stood up, | noticed the next room, the door is ajar. | see all the shower heads. I'mina\nconcentration camp, | knew that. I'm under guard. I'm naked, no clothes. | went to the shower. |\nwalked in the next room, the water is not running yet, but the whole room of the shower head, | stood\nin the shower head, and another guy comes in, he stood, then a third guy comes in. Now we start\ntussling. Everybody wants a better spot. The water starts running, because everybody is burning.\n>> Bill Benson: From the disinfectant?\n>> Leon Merrick: From the disinfectant. Now the water starts running a little bit, so we're happy,\nwe're still alive at that point. This was finished, | walked into the next room. There was a guy, he had\na pad, paper, my name, he writes out where | come from, your profession. | said | was a student, 17\nyears old. He writes it all down. Goes to the third guy in the next room, | guess, gave me a jacket,\nplain jacket, not the striped pajama jackets, just plain. Gave me pants. No socks, no underwear.\nGo to the third guy, | can see he has wooden clogs. | see one clog is not the same size. |\nsaid, when | got to him, \"They're not going to fit.\"\n\"| say they fit.

Then when they had enough people in the column, somebody\ncomes out, a functionary in the camp, not a guard, one of the prisoners too, but he already has a job\nin the camps. He says \"Forward march,\" and they led us into a barrack. It was a dark barrack. One\nwindow, one naked light bulb and shelves. At that point, they're looking for volunteers. Two\nvolunteers to go to the main kitchen and bring soup and bread for the new transfers. That means for\nUS.\nA couple guy volunteers, they're gone 10, 15 minutes, come back with a big kettle of soup and\nbread. They gave me a piece of bread, put the piece of bread in my pocket. They gave me a new\nbowl, because we didn't bring a bowl. Wooden bowl with a spoon. Gave a bowl of soup. | ate the\nsoup. | thought I'm going to eat the bread later. By the evening, | put down my hand, somebody\nswiped the bread.\n[Laughter]\nThere was no bread. To this day, | don't remember. | had a regular jacket. | got ahold of needle and\nthread. Somebody stole it for me. Maybe the people who take care of the barrack. Gave me a\nneedle and thread, and | sewed up the outside, opened my -- | punched a hole, from now on,\neverything goes here.

Tell us about\nthe reds and the greens.\n>> Leon Merrick: OK, all right. Buchenwald was built in 1937, 1937-38. As a matter of fact, when\nthey had the Kristallnacht, the pogrom against the Jews, most Jews when they rounded them up to\nsend them to Dachau or Buchenwald. At that time, the greens had the upper hand. The greens --\nthe Germans administered the camp, the guards outside. The main station were the Germans, the\nmilitary, the uniforms. Inside the camp was run by the inmates. Talking about the 1937-38, that's\nbefore the Germans, the European countries were conquered.\nSo who was in the camps? Jehovah witnesses, German criminals. We had the\ndesignations. The greens were the criminals. After the Nazis came to power, they rounded up the\ncommunists.\n>> Bill Benson: It could have been a murderer?\n>> Leon Merrick: Right. Had a green label.\n>> Bill Benson: He's in charge?\n>> Leon Merrick: In charge. The commoners had the red label. All German. That's before they\nconquered the territory. Later on, Auschwitz and Austria in 1938, it was the Austrian population, they\nwere old. The greens run the camp, the criminals. Somehow in 1942, the reds took it over. That\nmeans the red triangles, the commoners.\n>> Bill Benson: And then, of course, all the Jews are brought in?\n>> Leon Merrick: The Jews came into the camp, that's right.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\n>> Bill Benson: This is where Buchenwald, where you met your friend who became your good buddy.\nWas that Buchenwald?

He was not in the Lodz ghetto. | met him in\nthe labor camp. He came from a different city. He became close, more or less. We worked not in\nthe same machine, but we worked for the same factory. Then the Germans came to round us up, on\nthe double, to the train station. | went together with him too. We wound up in the same cattle car.\nOnce he got off the cattle car, you know how it is, the guard says, \"Column of five,\ncolumn of five,\" he wound up in a different barracks, | wound up in a different barrack. But I'd see him\nevery day outside.\nThen we had to leave Buchenwald. We hooked up together again. We went together. The\nnext thing, they took us to the train station in open cattle cars --\n>> Bill Benson: The reason they took you out of Buchenwald, because the Allies are getting close?\n>> Leon Merrick: The Allies are coming, the Soviets are coming. One side before the Battle of the\nBulge. The Americans are landing. First they took out the Jews. But they said all the Jews\nassemble. Didn't want to go in the Jews transport. They said they'll give you right away. | was hiding\nfor two days underneath the barracks. Somebody caught me there, gave me a kick. It hurt several\ndays. | couldn't sit down.

The doors opened up, the guards with whips, we\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\ncome out, they're whipping us, \"Column of five.\" We had enough people, a few thousands people,\nthey marched us to the city of Weimar, near Buchenwald. They had the railroad through there, put us\nin open cattle car. Once in cattle car, | couldn't sit down. All of a sudden, the siren starts wailing, you\ncan see the guard. Then we hear the clear signal, the train starts moving.\nBy that point, we got shot down -- Allies planes were all over the trains, shooting down.\nThe guards encouraged this to wave to the attacking planes. Tell them the guards are doing the\nshooting. Even at this stage, we don't want to die. Whoever had a jacket, took off the jacket, waved\nto the planes. Some people had hats, took it off to wave. The planes came so low, | could see the\npilot inside. But the guards, they had the guns trained on us.\n| remember one time --\n>> Bill Benson: These planes are strafing the cars that you're in?\n>> Leon Merrick: Right there. Before we even start moving the first time | came out from the camp, |\nwas thinking the train didn't move yet, open cattle car, the planes came from nowhere, jet planes.\nSomething hit me in my face. | turned to my friend, a fellow walker. We became close. | turned to\nhim, | said, \"Am | bleeding?\" He looks at me, \"No, you're not bleeding.\"\n| turn around, | see a wooden sign there like crossroad or crossing. | think maybe one of\nthe splinters hit my face, but not enough to cause bleeding.\n>> Bill Benson: Others were killed by the strafing?\n>> Leon Merrick: Oh, yeah, they were killed.\nThe first time the planes start shooting, the guards jumped off the cattle car, open cattle car.

In the camp, |\npicked up a little German. | heard the guards, they said the Americans, they're going to go back for\nmore bombs, come back and shoot us up again. After 10, 20 minutes, the guards came back, the\nguards start walking back. | walked back with them too. When they came back to the trains, and the\nguards noticed what happened to the rucksack, because we left all of the rucksacks, but everybody\nrunning away. Some of our guys. They cut the bags open, they took out sausages, cigarettes and\nbreads and crackers. The guards lined us all up, empty your pockets, turn out the pockets. | had\nnothing, because --\n>> Bill Benson: Because you had been with them?\n>> Leon Merrick: That's right. They found a piece of bread, and you got shot. | remember one guy,\nthey're chasing him. He run away, they never caught him. He came back. They didn't bother him --\nnever caught him. He came back, they didn't bother him. Once we step out of the train station, the\nopen cattle cars, | jumped off the cattle car, | spread out, underneath the cattle car. | could see the\ngravel, the bullets. After they knocked everything out, the guards announced from now on we're\ngoing to walk. \"Everybody line up.\" Me and my friend, the fellow walker, it's 1944, | left home, you\nknow, this is beginning of 1945, April.\n>> Bill Benson: April 1945?\n>> Leon Merrick: | still was in good shape. | stood first in line, in the first line, and then we start\nwalking.

Or they had one guard, he\nwalked over the column, if you didn't walk straight, he pulled you out from the column, threw you in\nthe ditch and you got shot. When he shot a guy, everybody from the column runs over to him, to go\nthrough his pockets. Maybe he's got cigarettes, maybe a crumb of bread, maybe his shoes are better\nthan yours. Pull up the shoes, pull out the pocket. Until the guard says \"Everybody back in!\"\nEverybody goes back in. Then we might be walking maybe another few minutes, but people are\nweak at that stage. They didn't feed us. You can hear shots again. Same old story.\nWe came to another camp, Flossenburg. Not long, two, three days, it was closed, evacuated\nthis camp. Put us in open cattle cars. Same story, planes overhead. We learned already, when the\nplanes are there, pick up a jacket and wave to them.\n>> Bill Benson: The Germans wanted you to signal to the --\n>> Leon Merrick: The guards, to signal. The guards are with us in the cattle car, they don't want to\nget killed.\n>> Bill Benson: They thought you were their protection?\n>> Leon Merrick: Whatever it is. We waved to them. The last time | remember, once they shot up\nthe locomotives, so we couldn't walk anymore. They marched us out, \"From now on, you're going to\nwalk.\" We walked. We walked. It was raining over there. One of my buttons popped. | had a\ncivilian jacket. | had this thing tied around, we walked. At one point, | thought, OK, towards evening\nthe guards told us you're going to spend the night here. It was woods. It was fall. A lot of leaves on\nthe ground. They put leaves towards the ground, lay down to sleep.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nIn the morning, | hear that whistle, everybody get up. | get up. A couple guys nearby\ncouldn't get up. The guard told them, \"Why don't you wake them up?\" The guard comes with the rifle\nbutt, crushed the skull. \"Everybody in the line.\" So we just walk away. We started walking at that\ntime. We walked all night long. We heard the hum, it was getting dark. | thought it was thundering.\nBut the Allies were close by. We didn't know it was thunder. People were walking out. A shot here, a\nshot there.\nThe last night, my knees got buckling up there. My friend, my fellow walker who | met in\nPoland, | said maybe | should go rest nearby. He said, \"You go, you're going to get shot.\" He said,\n\"Why don't you stay in the middle? Don't go to the side. Lean on me.\" | don't know if i leaned on him\nor not.\nWe walked in the ghetto. Came in the morning to a village. The guards told us, \"We're\ngoing to arrest you.\" They left us in a barn. The night before it was raining. Our clothes were\nsteaming. | sat down, in a bundle of straw, he sat next to me. All of a sudden, a raw egg.

He had half, | had half egg.\nAt that point, we hear shooting. We see the guards in the barn, that tried to pry the door open, they're\nlooking for something white to put in the muzzle of the rifle to try to get out.\nIn the meantime, one of the guys in the barn, they go to look in the barn, he says, the Russians\nare here. The Russians! Those were American tanks with white cars. We came from Eastern\nEurope. At that time, we couldn't tell.

People going to the truck, taking jackets, pants, even rags.\n| went to the truck, | took leather boots. | had no socks. | couldn't take them off later on.\n| had to cut them off. At that point, | see a lady with a kid, a German woman, she had a kid. | guess\nthe kid was for protection, because so many thousands of people just got eliminated from the\nconcentration camps.
