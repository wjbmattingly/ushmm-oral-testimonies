But, my Hebrew name was Hannah and, or is still Hannah, Hannah , aS a matter of fact, and that was my maternal grandmother's name. Until, my mom died about six months ago, and she used to call me Hannala still. So, that's how | started out. And then as a kid, as | went through the war, | guess they made it from Anna, Anny because that sounded more French when we got into France. And then with all the various papers that my parents got, mostly my mother, | was with her most of the time, they came, the name came with the papers. So if it was Marie, well, | was told, you know, you are now Marie, if it was Renee(ph), you are Renee, if it's Charlotte, | think the last one was Charlotte, Charlotte Henri(ph), that was the one before. And a very funny thing happened after the war, when my father came back from concentration camp and my mother wanted him to meet the people who had, they weren't officially hiding us because we were paying rent there supposedly, but at least we were living there under false pretenses and | think they knew that we weren't exactly who we said we were. My mother wanted to meet those people and they, so her name was, | can't remember what her name was, Tonree(ph) was the last name, which is a very French name, and they called him Monsieur Tonree when they first saw him, which was very funny. They never got used to the idea that we, actually even our names were not our names. And so that's the story of the name."

That where my, those were my concerns was to remain alive and to have a family, but not whether | would remember who | was or who | wasn't, that, you Know, | think inside of me, | knew very well who | was. So that, | mean after awhile, even though | was very young, | understood that it was just necessity and that it didn't really change whoever | was. And | played the game, essentially. | went to church, you know, | played the game. You know. Just knew this is what you have to do and that was that. You know, went for communion to the priest and all that stuff. And at that time | must have been six or seven, you know, so, at the most. So | just did it, you know, and | knew it was a game and | knew, you know, sometimes | said | wish | were Catholic because it would be so nice, particularly wnen they had communion and they had the white dresses and, that | really envied, you know. And | did stand somewhat in awe of the church, you know, it was extremely impressive, you know, when you go into a big church and the priest stand there and, you know, pontificates and the music and so on. That was impressive and | kind of wished | could identify with that whole thing, but as my mother told me and many people repeated to me, that at the age of four | already had sort of taken leave of religion, you know, and didn't want to obey anything. So that, basically, | think was sort of a refuge, it made me, in some ways, feel safe, you know, if | could be part of that group, | would be safe. And | don't think it was, in retrospect, such a deep religious feeling as some sort of feeling of being protected, you know, in church you were protected. And if you're part of that group, nothing happened to you. So | think it was, you know, as a young kid, going with the children of the town and our neighbors, | mean our landlords, going to church on a Sunday, | was, | felt extremely alienated, you know, in one aspect, and trying to play the game and like believing that maybe | was Catholic and | could be Catholic and | could just proceed, you know, from there on and not have to worry about being who | was.

Never. So | don't think | did. But | did pray, because | certainly had to go to communion and say all the words and go to confession and confess to sins that | made up. You know, things of that sort.

He was too old to join and he was, anyway, he was injured, so he was really, really, really happy. And then, so that's, you know, how we found out. | mean, the radios and everybody was just extremely, extremely excited. So there was just a joy in the streets and everybody, people pouring out from every house, apartment, in the streets, there was just thousands of people even though it was a small town, it looked to me like, you know, thousands of people. | really don't know how many they were. So that's, essentially, what | remember. And | remember then, somehow, my mother getting notice that my father had returned. And leaving me there to go find him.

And it was in a truck, you know, just one of those trucks with, not even covered, but some sort of tarp cover, that's it, and we traveled from there and it took days and days and days. | don't Know who was driving the truck, | have no idea. And it just, see, certain stupid things, | mean, I, | was still very nasty and very angry and at some stop there was nothing to drink except beer and | said that | would rather die than drink beer, you know, just as a, who knows why?

And so we did. We moved, my mother, my father, myself, moved to that, we moved to the ground floor of the house that had three flights. It was like one of these railroad houses, very skinny, everything was one room behind the other. And there was no running water, | remember that very well. There was no central heat. So we had to pump the water. And we had a coal stove to do everything, basically. And at first, when we first got back, my parents and | went to a sort of an inn in the Ardennes(ph), which is the hilly part, they call it mountains, but in reality it's just hills, hilly part of Belgium and | think that was the only time in his life that my father ate non-kosher food.

So, we went, | think originally it was supposed to be for a month, but no sooner we were there, my mother took off and she went to Antwerp because there were many people who were getting married who had been separated during the war and got together and she went to cook for weddings. Not for money, you know, just out of, you know, community feeling. And so she left us and she would come back and forth.

So, and | was extremely disappointed because he was extremely orthodox and wanted me to be that way. And extremely rigid in his, the practice of religion where, you know, he wouldn't allow me to turn on the light on the Sabbath, | mean he was extremely, extremely, https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection extremely strict and rigid and | could not abide by this. | just could, | didn't believe in it and | kept telling him that | didn't see how, after what he's gone through, he could still believe in this sort of stuff. And so there was really a crack in our relationship because of that. You know, he tried, on other fronts. | mean, my father was not an educated man and he would make an effort and take me to the movies and | know that this was not something that he would have done normally, this is something he really did to try and regain some, some closeness with me. | mean, I'm sure he missed it, too, but he just didn't know how to go about it. And | think in some ways, he was soiled, you know, as far as, why did he let himself be taken? Why didn't he, why wasn't he the strong man | thought he was in, you know, protecting us all and why did he just disappear? | mean, he just, he was supposed to meet us Somewhere and he never showed up. You know, and at that time, | think | had this certain resentment towards him for being my fallen hero, you know, why didn't, why didn't you protect us and why were you gone and why were you, come back in such a decrepit state, you know, you look terrible and, you Know, you can't really be my strong father. You know, so | had a lot of that. And | don't think | could tell him, | really couldn't, the only fights that we openly had was about religion. And | think | then channeled everything into absolutely refusing to have anything to do with the religion because | got, you know, it was a little inconsistent, like angry at God like for allowing this to, and then somebody who allows this to happen, can't exist, just can't be. So that was the end of my religious, and we fought about that for a very, very long time. Through my teens it was really bad, really bad because there were very few of us left, for one, of children my age who returned to Antwerp. And the majority of them were not observant and so, | mean their families weren't, and by forcing me to, you know, stay in on the Sabbath and not being able to go to the movies like Saturday afternoon, | was cut out from a lot of social activities, as well, so | resented that terribly, terribly, so | was really angry as an adolescent. | mean, on top of everything else, | was not a, not a happy camper in my youth. Not at all. So | don't think | ever, | mean now, you know, my father has been dead for 20 years or more, | can understand what he was about and how strong he actually had been to survive this and to be able to rebuild a family and bring his entire family, his entire surviving family to live with us after having gone through hell himself. And making money just to, you know, feed all these brothers and sisters, | mean two brothers, a sister and his father moved in with us, into that place what didn't have water. His father, a sister and two brothers, right. You know, and | just resented that awfully, | mean | wasn't, not charitable at all."

So again, it was a matter of feeling, you know, in that first place, it was a railroad house, as | said, so the kitchen was all the way in the front, behind it was something which was more, was the dining room | would say, and then in the back of it was a living room that wasn't used at all, and then in the back of it was a bedroom. And the first, | don't know whether months, how long, but the first, for sure, month that we lived there, my parents and | slept in one bed and the bed used to collapse. It was extremely frightening. It was, | don't know what it was made of, it was some cheap wood bed and it would just collapse and we would find each other, you know, on the floor. And my father had these incredible nightmares and he would be screaming, aside from that. And | had my own nightmares. So it was a nightmare, it was hell, absolute hell. And then, again, | can't say for, it's six months or a year, they bought me some kind of bed where | was in the so-called dining room and the family, the additional, the uncles and aunts and that group, moved to the third floor, so we had the first, ground floor, the family, the owners, had the floor right on top of us, the owner's husband did not come back from the war, so she was with two children by herself, so she needed the rent, and then the top floor was for the two uncles, the aunt and the grandfather. But food was all at our house, everything, laundry, food, everything. Without refrigerator, without any, you know, fancy appliance of any kind, so in some ways, in some ways it was almost worse than during the war. Because during the war, | had some kind of stability, | mean for the last couple of years when | lived in that house in Exleba, as | said, | was in terror but it was, to some extent | had accommodated to the terror. There was not that much unpredictable that was happening. We had our air raids and we'd run off and go to the shelters, by that time https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection | had one name and that didn't change any more and | had some sort of routine. And my mother, when she was there, was there for me, there was no, she had all these people that she was hiding and so on, but still, | felt that she was there, you know, for me. We would go to the beach together on occasion and we would do things together, whatever they were. But then she disappeared, essentially. She was diluted so much to such an extent that in some ways, | felt more abandoned than during the war, even though | wasn't afraid for my life. | mean, and so my, | think a lot of that anger was due to the fact that | was just lost, you know, just, it felt like | was to take care of myself plus take care of my brother. Which | had to do, | mean | had to babysit for him and, because we couldn't afford any help, and my mother was just unable to do everything, she was doing care for my brother, you know, day and night, so when | came home from school, | mean | had to watch my brother, | had to, | learned how to cook very early because | had to help for, you know, for making a meal for Friday night for 10 people without, you know, appliances, | mean on a coal stove and it was a Friday night and for Saturday lunch and for Saturday evening before you could turn on the lights again. | mean, that sort of, so | had to pitch in, come home from school Friday early and help my mother or watch my brother or both and | didn't have much time to be a kid, you know. Just not much time. But, the lady who rented the place had two children and one boy was about a year or two older than | was at the time and he and | had become really good friends in the war and sort of partners in crime, you know, we could think of every possible mischief and we would just do it. And so we continued that. And we established, he was very mechanically gifted, in fact, he's an aeronautics engineer for Israel, for the Israel government, so that really panned out. And we would just build things and we'd build some kind of telephone between his bed and mine and we'd go to the, there was a flea market every Sunday morning and we'd go and we'd buy all these components and we'd build radios and so dolls was really not my thing. It was erector sets and radios and that sort of thing. So he had a tremendous influence on me. Unfortunately, he left for Israel when, | mean he and his mother and sister left when he was about 13, so that was a terrible loss.

My grandfather was extremely orthodox, too, so the entire household became, in fact, being Catholic was easy because there's nothing you have to do. You could eat whatever you want, you'd go to church, but it's, you know, an act of presence, | mean you show up, that's it, doesn't matter much. But here all of a sudden, there are all these rules and you can't do this and you can't do that and Friday night you have to rush and take your bath, and in turns, eight people, there is no tub, so you're just washing in some kind of the zinc tubs, you know. | mean, | hated this.

And the pressure, the tension was just unbearable in the household, you know, until they lit those candles and everybody sort of sigh of relief, you know. It's all done. And then, of course, the only person who had to continue working through this was my mother because she had to serve the food and wash the dishes. Finally, after perhaps a year, we hired somebody to come and do the dishes Friday night and to clean the house, things started improving and after they all got married, we moved to a different place. We moved to an apartment which, at the time, well, there were other feelings, there were feelings of jealousy for people, my friends, Leon(ph) and Regine(ph) and their parents, who had, we had been together for part of the war, but they had made it to Switzerland. And so they came back and they hadn't gone through the rest of it and they were much better off financially because the father hadn't been in concentration camp and they didn't have to take in the entire family, they just took in my mother's friend's mother and so, they moved to a very nice place with hot water and a bathtub and | was extremely jealous. | was so jealous. And | kept saying, you know, if we didn't have all these people here, maybe we could move and have a nicer life. And | mean, | made no bones about that, as | said, | was not charitable in the least. And then when they moved out, we https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection did move to a better place. It was not as nice as what these people had, but at least | had the semblance of my own room and we had a tub, one bathroom for the, for the four of us, the five of us, my father, my grandfather, my mom, my dad and my brother and |, but that was a tremendous improvement over what had been. And at that time, all these people still used to come for most Friday nights with their spouses and they used to come for all the holidays. And in reality it was very nice, even though it was a lot of work, but then we had help, | mean we had a cleaning woman and my mother had hired, by then my brother was, you know, maybe four or five or something, she had hired sort of a nanny, not really a nanny, but she would come every afternoon and pick him up from kindergarten and, you Know, come home and feed him a snack and she would stay til dinnertime, she wouldn't stay til after, but she would stay until dinnertime. And she'd come Friday nights and do the dishes when we had 20 people for dinner and she'd do them on Saturday. And all the Saders(ph) and all that stuff was all with my mother, everything. And when the babies started appearing, those families, it was all still with us. But | didn't resent it any, you know, it was, | think it was controlled. You know, it was just for holidays and things like that, so |, | actually, | began to like them, | began to babysit for their kids."

They only go on the high holidays and all the other holidays were, they don't really, there's some, very few women go to services in the orthodox community. What they do is usually they go pick up their husband as he comes out. So they get all dressed up and they go pick up their husband and then they'd go for a walk in the park. There's a park in Antwerp, just the central park of Antwerp, and you'd see everybody parading in their new hats and new clothes. And | hated that. | absolutely hated it. And at that point, somewhere around the age of nine or ten, | told my mother that | wasn't going to be like her. | was going to be entirely independent and | wasn't going to have a man give me money every week. Which is what happened. My mother would get an allowance, essentially, to run the household and there were numerous arguments about that. And she always got what she wanted, and she would lie because she gave a lot of it to charity, but see, he didn't know that. So she would say, well, | bought myself a dress for, you know, a thousand dollars or something ridiculous and he could say, \"What! You know, where did you have an idea that you could afford a dress for a thousand dollars?\" And she would say, \"Well, you know, | needed it\". Or something like that, and then they would argue like crazy and then he would give her, I'm making up a number, she probably never bought a dress for a thousand dollars, but the equivalent now, let's say, and he would sort of shake his head and, you know, couldn't believe it. But she would give the money away, you know, she would send it to this relative and that https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection relative and she would give it away locally, | mean, so and | told her that | was never, never in a million years, going to be like, in that situation. At age nine or ten. And | said on top of that | would never get married because that just didn't look right to me. None of this looked right to me. And | remember my mother's friend saying, \"Well, it's, you know, you just have to know how to work that situation\". You know, they were all in the same situation and they had really nice husbands, but they all had to argue to get the money so, you know, whatever the husbands evaluated the expenses to be, they kind of doubled or tripled them, for whatever reasons. And they'd have their own little, you Know, savings aside that they had accumulated from their husband's weekly allowance. And I'll tell you, when | got married, my mother- in-law told me to do this. But | wasn't in that framework at all. But she told me, you know, put away money of your own, just don't tell him, just put it away. We were both students, there was no way that anybody had any money to put away. But it was such a strange concept, you know, that | just couldn't go along with that."

You know, they seemed to have such power and, you know, everybody was very deferent to doctors. So, | don't think | was in it really to help people, | think | was in it more for interest. So, that's what | was going to be. And, so in order to do that, | couldn't stay in that, see that school was, as | said, in shambles, it was the remnants of a pre-war, very, very fine Jewish school, but because, so the system in Belgium was that if you went to public school, you could get into university after graduation, you didn't need to take a special test. But, if you went to private school, you had to take a very, very thorough sort of baccalaureate type of exam. So, and you had to, in order to get to university, at that point, Antwerp became a Flemish town, so you had to go to a public school in Flemish. | didn't Know any Flemish, really not, | mean | just knew a few words to talk to the cleaning woman and | didn't have a lot of interaction with her because when she was there | was in school and | hardly ever saw her. So that was a bit of a problem because you had to have an admissions test in Flemish. So, | don't know, see people think maybe I'm lying, but I'm not, | mean | went and | took the test and a friend of mine came with me and she copied everything from me and she didn't get in. So, but | don't Know, | mixed French and Flemish and whatever | could think of, you know, in the answers. | mean, the, | don't know what the questions were and | only had three years of elementary school and everything was, really, | Knew nothing https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection really well except reading, that's all | really knew. Well, the rest | knew, math was terrible, because | didn't have the elementary stuff, you know, | was really bad. And so | got into this extremely, extremely difficult public school that had six years of studies. And in order to go to university, you had to take the classic tract, so the classic tract was Latin and Greek. Plus Flemish, of course, which was the main, plus six hours of math a week. | mean, this was really horrible, and my experience at that school was terrible, just terrible because there were only two Jewish girls in it and even though it was really a secular school, it was a public secular school, because in Belgium they have, as they have here, a Catholic system that is parallel to the public system, | obviously, so the people who came to the secular schools were not Catholic, or at least not practicing or not very serious about their religion since they chose the public school. But | still felt very alienated and really not welcome. | felt there was real anti-semitism there."

            "question": "In Antwerp in general it was this feeling at the time?",
            "answer": "Well, | couldn't tell because the Jews really lived very much in the ghetto, even though they didn't live that much physically a ghetto, they lived spiritually and culturally in a ghetto, there was very little mixing. So the only traces of anti-semitism were, | have a friend who lives down in Boston, she's several years older, and we sometimes speak Flemish just kind of out of, you know, out of fun and there is one kind of joke we have, is if we haven't heard from each other for a long time, she'll greet me like in Flemish, [Flemish phrase], like, are you still alive? And she said that's how they greeted her when she came back to school, like, , gee, you know, | thought you were dead. So, that was the atmosphere among the Flemish, although many had been hiding Jews. They really then had a concerted effort to rescue Jewish children and hide them, but obviously, there were a fair number of people who, and you know, it's, | couldn't even say that it was vicious, it was like having no clue and say, oh, you know, well, we thought you were dead, kind of a thing. But just imagine, when you have survived something like this, you don't feel that great. And the other thing that contributed to my feeling pretty bad was that we had school on Saturdays and my father didn't let me go. And so, | was already really, you know, culturally deprived, | mean | was, | don't know how | managed to do well in school because | did, but it was strictly grabbing things here and there and putting them together, but not having a coherent view of things. It was, | missed, you know, a sixth of math every week, which was algebra and going on to, you know, higher math and |, | really, | had a lot of trouble catching up and staying afloat. Missing one hour of Latin and one hour of Greek every week, and trying to make up, whereas the six hours, | mean the five hours that we had were hard enough, you know, to try then every week, by the time you catch on, there you go, you're missing three or four or five hours of really important work. And then | had to go after Sabbath, pick up the work from these people who weren't very friendly, they let me in their https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection house, but like barely, and try and copy it over. | mean, it was hell. And then, when the Jewish holidays came on Monday and Tuesday, so now here we go, | miss Saturday, of course, Sunday no school. Sunday | can't go pick up the notes because Sunday the holiday starts early and we have to go through that routine of bathing and getting ready and whatever. And so by Wednesday, | mean you can imagine how | felt when | got to school. | mean, the people were talking about things | had absolutely no clue about and the teacher said, \"Well, you know, you want to observe your religion, that's okay with me, but I'm not going to help you. You'll just whatever, you know, do it yourself\". So we did, this girl and myself, and we had six miserable years. But somewhere in between, in 1951, | believe it was, my father's immigration papers, he had applied to come to this country in 1933, and of course, the Americans had no intention of saving a single Jew so they made sure he didn't get the papers and they figured by, like , In '51, he'd be dead. But in '51, his number came up, and so this was in sort of the middle of the Korean war and there was big panic in Europe that this was going to turn up to be World War Ill. And so my father said, \"I'm not going to survive another war, | just, | will not be able to do that\". So we all left and we came here."

One of them came here in early 1900's, and in fact, my grandfather came as well.

Vases and this, and | mean it was just, really it was ridiculous. And my father was yelling at her. And | was yelling at her. But, she was always on the side of the, you know, the loser and the underdog and the, you know, you have to do this, you must do this, and what's the big deal, so we have one more suitcase. Yes, ma, now 10 more suitcases. And who's going to drag this? And then you get here and you go, first of all immigration treats you like shit, that's number one. | mean, really awful. And you land on this pier and these people appear who are primitive, in my view, because, see, even though my parents didn't have a formal education, my mother was anything but primitive, and the people who they associated with, again, had no education, but were very, they were street wise and they were, they had a veneer of worldliness about them because most them had been, they'd been to South America and America or Switzerland, so they, they had a better, they had a much wider experience. And they had to adjust very quickly, so many of them learned Spanish and then they learned French and then they learned German and they learned just to be able to stay alive and to function in those societies, so they had a veneer of worldliness, you know, and they had sort of, and they were very elegant, they had beautiful apartments. These people here lived in these buildings with the, you know, the fire escapes. And | had a totally different vision of America, which had been fed to me by the movies of the early 50's, you know, with these Hollywood apartments and the little maids with the little white things. And | took a look at this, | said, \"My God, you know, this is awful\". | mean, I'd much rather be in Antwerp because that's really not me at all. And the first thing these people would ask you is, \"How do you like America?\" You know, and having been just treated like garbage, | would say, \"| hate America\". And my mother was furious. And | mean, it was just a bad experience. So we moved to Borough Park and there is where my brother, my mother's brother, had got us a place. And he got us a place off some rabbi who was going to Florida for the winter because we came in the winter. It happens that the rabbi's travel plans didn't work out quite as predicted, so here we come, four people and the rabbi and his wife with the wig, the little girl, you know, snotty nose, white socks, | mean, just, you know, from the ghetto, from Poland, this is how it looked to me. And we have to spend two nights with them in the same apartment. And there were roaches there and we had left our apartment, which was not luxurious, but compared to that, it was clearly Trump Tower. And so, | felt very bad about this whole thing and when they left, you know, at least we got, the place was ours and it became a little easier. And in fact, then | started having a good time because my mother's brother who left, | told you, with his three , he left with his three kids on that last boat, his daughter is about two years older than | am and she's wonderful, a really wonderful person. And so she was really very welcoming to me and she took me with her friends, although it seemed to me she https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection was from Mars. We had, we really, we took a liking to each other immediately, but we, we were so different, so completely different that | couldn't understand any of the stuff she did. | mean, she would, on Saturday night if she didn't have a date, she would not dare put her nose out the house and | would, \"Look Renee(ph), let's go to the movies\". And she says, \"No, we can't\". And | said, \"Why not?\" And she wouldn't tell me, you know, because | was still maybe a little too young for her to, and she would have a bunch of friends, they'd come to the house and they would do their hair and they would do all these stupid things and they wouldn't, and | couldn't, | was just, | couldn't understand, but | liked her a lot and so | had fun, | think it was almost like an anthropological study at that time, like what are these people thinking? And then we had to move to, so my mother didn't like it there in Borough Park and we moved to Manhattan. "

And | was dating, although | didn't like the scene, there was something kind of nice about it. And | was becoming more independent. So | don't think | was looking forward to going back to Antwerp at all. | think | was, by that time, beginning to open up to the possibilities of much more freedom. And the possibility of meeting a lot more people in may age group. In Antwerp it was extremely restricted and, as | said, there were some that were going to these religious things which | wasn't going to go into. There were some that were going to the non-religious one, | mean still the organized Zionist group, | couldn't join that because my father wouldn't let me and besides, as | said, I'm not sure | was that type. And then there was a group of very rich kids, or at least acted as they were, as if they were very rich, and they were very sophisticated and had their hair done in nice places and we couldn't afford that. So | wasn't really comfortable with them either. So | was quite isolated and had just, and then the pressure was on to just get married. In all those groups, you know, and | mean | couldn't deal with this at all. | simply couldn't deal with this. So | had two or three friends, girlfriends mostly, til the end of high school. And we'd just meet in each other's houses and commiserate, basically. Complain about how terrible life was in Antwerp. And so that's how it was until | graduated high school. And a time, about, when | was studying for my big finals in high school, it was around the holiday of Pentecost, you know, , my, one of my uncles, Myer, you know, who had lived with us, and his wife had taken an apartment for the month of June at the seashore and they invited me to come for that holiday. So | came and | brought all my books to study my final exams. And | was studying on the beach because it, it was the month of June and it was not high season yet, there were just families with young children. And this one guy, you know, approached me and he was a young man from Antwerp, but just a few years older than | was. And we started dating. So then | had sort of a good time for awhile except that he wanted to get married. And | just didn't want to. | mean, | just did not.

And medical school is seven years, So you do all the science courses that you would normally do in college, you do in the first year of medical school, all together. And in addition, you do anatomy. And the https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection cadavers and me, that just didn't work out very well. Not at all, | couldn't take it. So in fact, | became anorectic again, but again, it wasn't like, you know, | thought | was fat and | wasn't going to eat, but | stopped eating because, just the odor would pursue me and | really think that that had a connotation with the concentration camps and with having seen those horrible pictures and having seen my father the way he looked when he came back.

And | lost maybe 10 pounds, 15 pounds, 20 pounds, | was really disintegrating. So that was one problem. My other problem is, the school was in Brussels and my father wouldn't let me live in the dorms, which means | had to commute, which means | had to get up every morning at five, be on the train at seven and be awake in class at eight. And come back at 7:00 at night. So that was one very difficult, and the other thing about that was that that first year was, you know, math and physics and chemistry and these were things that | just didn't know. | mean, | faked my way through high school, basically, but | didn't know it.

So they were very free thinkers, | mean that was, so | think that the Jewish aspect was less of a problem there. The people there were truly secular. And | don't recall feeling, you know, no, in fact, | made a lot of friends. Mostly men, though. And that was very bad because Antwerp still is, you Know, a small gossipy town. And for the daughter of Natan(ph) Leiser to be seen with a non-Jew was close to prostitution. | mean, | think they equated that essentially with prostitution. So | had a really bad reputation in Antwerp and my father was shattered that | would do such a thing.

And he managed to make me pass which was a feat, | must tell you, this was a feat. And another friend, | mean he's, this man is a cardiologist and is very, you know, good reputation, is at the University of Brussels. The other fellow is the medical https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection director of the chief university hospital in Antwerp.

And | think that was our little group on the train. Four or five of us. And then there were non-Jews and we were friendly with them and, in fact, my friends, particularly who is the medical director of the Middleham(ph) Hospital in Antwerp, he's still friends with these people that we studied together, so | think the religion was not important there. At that point it became completely, just irrelevant. These people were really very free thinkers and educated and it was no longer a problem.

And | was struggling, you know, just to keep afloat.

But somehow she trained me in a couple of months to, again, present a credible picture, not, not really knowing what | was doing but enough to, and | remember clearly, clients coming in and they were looking for the boss, you know. | said, \"Well, | represent him\". And they were like, \"Oh, my God, you know, what is this?\" Because | looked very, very young, very young. | mean now maybe, | look my age, but then | didn't, | really, | looked 15 at the most, at the most, and that was stretching it because | couldn't get into movies where you had to be 17 without ID, | mean they wouldn't let me in at all. And so, but I, | really did an okay job, you know, | didn't lose the man any money, maybe | didn't do as well as someone who really Knew what they were doing, but | managed the office and there was two secretaries and there was a like chief accountant, but | had to present the stuff in the way that this person could, and | was their boss, which was really laughable. But | did it, | did it for a year and then | said this is clearly not my avocation. And | told my mother that | was going to go to Switzerland to study because | couldn't do it in Belgium because | wasn't going to be able to, this commuting business wasn't for me.

And that's how | started a biology degree and somewhere in the midst of all of that | met my husband. | met one woman who is an Israeli and I'm still very friendly with her, in fact, she called me on Saturday. And she was in the interpreter school, oh yeah, that's the other thing, all the girls who went to school to Switzerland were in interpreters. | didn't want to do that because | still had my views on a real job, you know. And something that | was interested in. So biology was just, just great. My friend that | met, Elana(ph), was an Israeli woman who was just a lot of fun, she's a great gal. And she was in interpreter school, so we became really good friends and | had these two Swiss girls, Christiana and Josiana(ph), and we became good friends. So immediately | had a group of friends. And so, of course, my parents were very worried about, is she ever going to get married. And | said, \u201cLook, I'm going to study, | don't know what I'm going to study, but I'm going to study something and I'm not getting married\". So they were very upset because there had been several candidates in between that | didn't mention from this fellow whom | met at age 17. There was a bunch of them and | didn't like any of them, | always had an excuse. And one was even a physician and, because | said, well this is uneducated, this is this, this is that, what's with the doctor? You know. | said, \"I just don't love him. That's it. | don't love him. I'm not marrying somebody | don't love and that's that\". So, they were getting really concerned and by that time | was 21, 22, and this is really getting to be the old maid. So everybody was concocting, you know, to have me meet men. So unbeknownst to me, there were relatives of his in Antwerp who, he had relatives there who he used to come and visit for holidays and so on. They told him about me, about this nice Jewish girl and, you know, when you're 22 and somebody tells you, nice Jewish girl, you say, oh, yeah, right. The same family told me about him and | said, \"Anybody who needs to be introduced by his uncle, | don't even want to know about\". So, but | didn't say anything, | said, \"Oh yeah, really\". And | knew some of, there were a lot of American students studying medicine in Geneva at the time. Those who were essentially there because they were Jews because there was clearly a quota of not admitting Jews to medical school in the United States.

And she knew only Hebrew and | didn't Know any, or you know, again, three years of elementary school, that was not exactly sufficient to, so | was in a sort of desperate state because | wanted to meet people. So | just really by force learned Hebrew, you know, just kept asking her, what's this, what's that, | mean just continuously and the dictionary. And by the end of the three months, | was fluent.

And | would hitchhike across the whole country and nobody thought anything about it, you know, it was just a normal thing to do. Nobody locked their doors, it was just wonderful. So | did that before | started medical school, so that was my graduation from high school.

So we, domineering people, particularly the father, and | insisted that we move to our own place. | said, \"I don't care if it's a hole, but a place of our own\". And we did, they did get us a place in the Windermere (ph) Hotel, which was west something or other, 90, 91st, I'm not sure, and Broadway, | think it was. Or, yeah, | think it was Broadway. But we, it was very difficult. | came here, he started to do some externships (ph) and interviewing in medical school and then | said, | wasn't, | didn't finish, | mean | was still, had | think a year or two to go. And | started looking at various colleges to see how | could continue what | was doing. And it looked extremely difficult because the curriculum wasn't the same and over there it was only science, but here in college, you needed all these core courses of English, literature and so on and |, really had already lost two years of medical school, one year of working, | didn't want to start, | was on the track and | just didn't want to get off it now. So we had some difficult times right after we got married because to him it was certainly much more enticing to transfer to a medical school, get an American degree and have not to deal with any of this foreign business. But to me, it was hell. And also, | must tell you that Geneva was, and perhaps still is, but it was paradise on earth, it was just beautiful. Just, just beautiful. And we had, you took in life, you know, we were very much in love, we loved what we were doing, the surroundings were beautiful, you Know, | mean we'd go to the lake, Lake, now | hear it's totally polluted, but you know, lunchtime we'd go and swim, we'd take boat rides, we'd go up in the mountains. | mean, his parents were very wealthy so he had a car and | mean, we just had a life, the best life, you know, no responsibilities except to our studies. And really enjoy life, for me, almost | would say for the first time, really, really enjoying my life. | mean, | had had moments, you know, that | had a good time and when | was in Brussels | had a good time and when | went to Israel | had a good time and here and there | had a good time, but | had mostly | was somber, you know. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection"

My mother-in-law never did anything outside of the house, she was a, pretty much a slave to her husband.

And he did, | mean he really did. But, his parents were up in arms. So while we were still there, one professor from an American university, so we went back to Switzerland because | really didn't want to stay. And reluctantly he agreed to come back.

And | was, https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection | cannot say how miserable.

So | continue writing and we keep sending back and forth between my sponsor, back and forth, and, but | started to work as a post-doctoral like this. Which was a terrible thing, too, because when | went for the interview | didn't tell them that | had a child because at that time, to be a woman was really not a plus. To be married was even less of a plus, to have one child was pretty much lethal and to be pregnant with a second was, you were, had zero chances of getting any kind of position in science, none, zero. So | didn't tell them | was pregnant. But then, you know, comes where it 's kind of hard. | don't know, | was so panicky. When | got there | said, \"Look, you know, | wasn't forthright, but I've got one child and the second one is on the way. But, | promise you | will work, | will continue to work\". And he was not pleased, the man was not pleased at all. But, | had gotten an MRC Fellowship which was also quite prestigious and | had gotten that really based on recommendations from the people who had trained me. So he necess, he really didn't have to pay me, | was getting it from the Canadian government, so he figured, okay, I'm not wasting that much resources on this person. And so, | went to McGill(ph) and he went to San Tristine(ph), which is the French hospital, but since he spoke French, having studied in Switzerland, there was no problem and they were very grateful to have an American who spoke French. That was a nice touch to it. And, so we were in McGill, | mean Canada, and then Karin was born over there. | went back to work five days after she was born. And, because I, you know, | felt that | had to, | just felt that | had to do this. And | read the last draft of my thesis in the hospital, having had the baby. And flew to New York to defend my thesis six weeks after | gave birth, and it was very funny because | couldn't sit, you know, | was really torn and | mean it was, | stood the entire flight and when | got to Brooklyn, | had to defend a thesis. And my thesis director wanted to do me a big favor and requested from the committee that | https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection should be allowed to sit. Because | had just given birth. And | said, \"No way. I'm not sitting\". | said, \"| sat on the plane, | just want to stand\". You know, and all men, of course. And, so | defended the thesis and that was fine and we went back to Montreal and we were there until 1971 where he finished his training and | kind of finished my doctorate, my post-doctorate fellowship, but | didn't have a job coming back. So | figured | have to get a job after he gets his because, obviously, he's going to be making much more money than | am. And my job would never be that reliable as a scientist. So he got the job and we came back, we bought a house, actually his father bought us a house because we certainly couldn't afford a house, and his father died right after. It was terrible.

And she became like a burden, she just wouldn't do anything and she'd come every weekend and we'd have to pick her up and bring her home. And on the weekend | didn't have help because this one lady that we had hired came when Karin was six, six months old, by the time we came back she was three, we came back, and she followed us. So she came from Belgium to Montreal and she came with us to the States, so she seemed like she was going to be there for awhile and that was a big help. But on the weekends she was off and so | was overwhelmed, | literally was overwhelmed. Between my mother-in-law and the kids and the pregnancy and not knowing anybody and it was not a good time. And, you know, the mourning of my father-in-law. And, so, but decided that | wasn't going to look for a job being pregnant because with three this clearly wasn't going to work. So | didn't, | stayed home for about eight months. And towards the end of my pregnancy, | started sending letters to people who had been my professors in graduate school and who had now moved on to being chair, you know, chairmen in big, big departments like Columbia and so on and so forth. And | said that they have to help me in the letter, and at least grant me an interview. So, one or two of them did, and one in particular, | told him, \"Look, everybody says that it's no point, there is no point training women because they have children and they don't work. I'm trained, | have children, but | want to work. So, are you going to help me or not?\" So he could say, he couldn't say no, so he got me a job as a research associate for, at Rockefellow University which is, obviously, very prestigious. And | was there for about a year and then started sending out all my CV's(ph) and landed a job at Yale. So | started working there in the Department of Neurology and became the assistant professor. And worked at Yale from about 1973 til '89. And sort of rose through the ranks, made it, | didn't make it to full professor, but | made it to research professor because | was in a clinical department and so | https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection couldn't really become, not having the MD degree, | couldn't become a real professor, full professor. And | commuted from New Rochelle to Yale which was 125 miles a day and did quite well, you know, established a reputation and, you know, raised the kids, | mean all kinds of good and bad things, you know, with the kids as usual. And that's it. In 1989, | moved to New York Medical College where | am now a full professor and have my own lab, teach medical students, . That's it, my kids, you know as | said, Jeane Pierre is married, is business, he looks very happy and | really like his wife. And more than that, | think she likes me which is a rare occurrence because |, | know exactly what not to do. And | also know what to do. And Karin is in medical school and she's going to be, become an obstetrician. And Brian is sort of getting his master's, but he's a little bit in limbo as to what he wants to do with it.
