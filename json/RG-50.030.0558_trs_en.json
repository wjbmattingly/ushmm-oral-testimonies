And the interview is conducted by Stephanie Blyskal. Good evening, thank you for letting us interview you. Can you start out telling me your name at birth, and where you were born?",
            "answer": "My name is Helena Swierezynska. I was born on the April 2\u2122, 1943, in Poland, in the place called Mielitz(ph). I\u2019m not positive, I\u2019m not sure hundred percent that this is exactly where th \u2014 I was born, but that\u2019s what is in my birth certificate. My family was in hiding. Year 1943 was the worst year for Jews, ever, in Poland. Until today I don\u2019t understand how my mom could afford to get pregnant, you know, during such a horrible time. But anyhow, she had the baby in hiding. Most of my family was hiding in the \u2014 the \u2014 in the barn. The family lived in a small village. We had a little bit of land, couple houses, nothing big. But enough, big enough to be hated by all Polish neighbors. So my family, which means my grandmother, my grandpa, and bunch of cousins, they were hiding in the barn \u2014 paying, of course, huge money for it. And my mom had me that summer, I don\u2019t know where, and with help of midwife. Well, the midwife, she was Polish, and she didn't want to have a Jew \u2014 Jewish baby, you know, for longer than few hours. So This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 4 she kept me actually one day after I was born. And then my mom, you know, after delivery, she was sick, not able to \u2014 to do nothing. So my two uncles, my mom\u2019s brothers, they came to pick me up. It is very important to understand that I was one day \u2014 one day old. My \u2014 my mom was the only daughter, and she had four brothers. Two of them, they took me from that midwife, to the place that the family was hiding. And I was crying and crying and crying. By the way, I just learned this all few years ago. I had no idea what happened to me. But my uncle who \u2014 who was about to die, finally he felt that he needs to tell me something. So that\u2019s how I learned, you know. Today I am 65, and I was probably about 60 when the \u2014 you know, I learned what happened to me. So anyhow, I was crying, I was screaming. Probably I was hungry, I was wet. And all those people hiding there were scared that, you know, they gonna be killed because of me. So my grandma, according to my uncle, my grandma decided that I cannot be with them. She came up with an idea that she\u2019Il \u2014 they will put me on \u2014 on the ground where people walk by a lot, and somebody will see a crying baby and will take the baby. That\u2019s what she was hoping. Well, nothing like this happened. They put me on that frozen ground. It \u2014 you know, the beginning of April in Poland \u2014 I don\u2019t even think it was April, cause the \u2014 there is no certain date, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 probably it was in March, because it was very, bitterly cold. So they put me, you know, on that cold ground, you know, and they were looking through, you know, sort of the hole in the wall, looking at me what\u2019s gonna happen. And people were walking \u2014 were walking by, and nobody This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 5 stopped. Nobody stopped. I was screaming like crazy, they were crying. Finally, after I don\u2019t know how many hours, my grandma said no, I \u2014 I cannot do this. She decided, you know, to take me back and when night came, my two uncles took me \u2014 still, you know, screaming, to the house of the lady, very simple woman, who was apparently mentally sick and nobody talked with her. People were scared of her. So she was without of contact with \u2014 with anybody. And her house was on the \u2014 on the skirt of that village. They took me there, cause they thought, she\u2019s alone, maybe she will take the baby. So one year old baby \u2014 I mean, one day old baby \u2014 this is very important and that\u2019s why I repeat it, you know, they put me on her steps. I was screaming. She opened the door, she saw the baby, she took me in. So this was \u00b043. I was in her house until \u201945. No idea how \u2014 how \u2014 what happened during this time. I might suspect that when I was crying, she was beating me up, because, you know, she was scared, too. So, actually \u2014 okay, of course, there was no milk. I was feeding, you know, with potatoes and water. I don\u2019t know how this happened that I survived. It\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019ve talked to the doctors, they say they never heard about such a thing. But anyhow, what happened during these two years, my mom, of course \u2014 my father was in a forest, hiding there. And my mom was very depressed. She was 19. She lost her baby, which she never touched. She didn\u2019t have parents and family. So she, one day she decided to go where they were hiding to see her mom and her dad. And the people who in the meantime took over our houses, our land, these people saw d-\u2014her going there. And they let know to the police \u2014 Polish police, which was This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0558 6 working very close with Gestapo, and th-the Germans came, killed almost everybody immediately. My two uncles, they were not there, they were hiding in the fields. So my mom, apparently that they \u2014 they didn\u2019t kill her at once, but she was hurt badly. And a few years ago, I went there. I was told not to by many people, because the people living there, they remember the family. They stole everything which belongs to us, and I was told it\u2019s dangerous to \u2014 even to be around, especially that I look hundred percent like my dad, so I am very easy to recognize. But I did, I go, I did go there. And I saw \u2014 I met li \u2014 a lady who was \u2014 I was just asking million questions, you know, and just between one sentence and the other, she told me about my family. I couldn't believe my ears, but I \u2014 I didn\u2019t even ask about the family. But she started to say, oh, we\u2019ve had the Jews, you know, here. There were parents and five kids, you know. There was one \u2014 one girl and four brothers. And that girl, she had a baby that\u2019s \u2014 the lady 1s telling me, you know, I am standing in front of her. And \u2014 and she says, but that baby for sure didn\u2019t survive, she says. And she says, I will never forget the scene the day they killed all \u2014 all that family, you know, hiding there. And she was not killed immediately, but she was hurt badly. And she had the long hair. They grabbed her, you know, for the hair, and they were dragging her through the main street of that village to the nearest forest. And they then \u2014 she was killed there. And that woman tells me, you know, I \u2014 this \u2014 I \u2014I can see like today, you know, that blood, you know, behind this woman. She had no idea who she talking to, and I had a dilemma, you know. I \u2014 I wasn\u2019t sure \u2014 I mean, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And my husband says, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go, don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t stay here. But before I left, you know, I ask her, do you know whom you're talking to? And she says no. I said, I am that baby, and I survived."
