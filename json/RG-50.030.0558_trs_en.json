            "question": "This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Helena Swierczynska , in Arlington \u0152 I\u2122m sorry, in Alexandria, VA on November 8th, 2008. And the interview is conducted by Stephanie Blyskal. Good evening, thank you for letting us interview you. Can you start out telling me your name at birth, and where you were born?",
            "answer": "My name is Helena Swierczynska . I was born on the April 2 nd, 1943, in Poland , in the place called Mielitz(ph). I\u2122m not positive, I\u2122m not sure hundred percent that this is exactly where th \u0152 I was born, but that\u2122s what is in my birth certificate. My family was in hiding. Year 1943 was the worst year for Jews, ever, in Poland. Until today I don\u2122t understand how my mom could afford to get pregnant, you know, during such a horrible time. But anyhow, she had the baby in hiding. Most of my family was hiding in th e \u0152 the \u0152 in the barn. The family lived in a small village. We had a little bit of land, couple houses, nothing big. But enough, big enough to be hated by all Polish neighbors. So my family, which means my grandmother, my grandpa, and bunch of cousins, they we re hiding in the barn \u0152 paying, of course, huge money for it. And my mom had me that summer, I don\u2122t know where, and with help of midwife. Well, the midwife, she was Polish, and she didn't want to have a Jew \u0152 Jewish baby , you know, for longer than few hours. So 4 she kept me actually one day after I was born. And then my mom, you know, after delivery, she was sick, not able to \u0152 to do nothing. So my two uncles, my mom\u2122s brothers, they came to pick me up. It is ve ry important to unders tand that I was one day \u0152 one day old. My \u0152 my mom was the only daughter, and she had four brothers. Two of them, they took me from that midwife, to the place that the family was hiding. And I was crying and cr ying and crying. By the way, I just learned this all few years ago. I had no idea what happened to me. But my uncle who \u0152 who was about to die, finally he felt that he needs to tell me something. So that\u2122s how I learned, you know. Today I am 65, and I was probably about 60 when the \u0152 you know, I learned what happened to me. So anyhow, I was crying, I was screaming. Probably I was hungry, I was wet. And all those people hiding there were scared that, you know, they gonna be killed because of me. So my grandma, according to my uncle, my grandma decided that I cannot be with them. She came up with an idea that she\u2122ll \u0152 they will put me on \u0152 on the ground where people walk by a lot, and somebody will see a crying baby and will take the baby. That\u2122s what she was hoping. Well, nothing like this happened. They put me on that frozen ground. It \u0152 you know, the beginning of April in Poland \u0152 I don\u2122t even think it was April, cause the \u0152 there is no certain date, you know, that\u2122s \u0152 probably it was in March, because it was very, bitterly cold. So they put me, you know, on that cold ground, you know, and they were looking through, you know, so rt of the hole in the wall, looking at me what\u2122s gonna happen. And people were walking \u0152 were walking by, and nobody 5 stopped. Nobody stopped. I was screaming li ke crazy, they were crying. Finally, after I don\u2122t know how many hours, my gr andma said no, I \u0152 I cannot do this. She decided, you know, to take me back and when night came, my two uncles took me \u0152 still, you know, screaming, to the house of the lady, very simple woman, who was apparently mentally sick and nobody talked with her. People were scared of her. So she was without of contact with \u0152 with anybody. And her house was on the \u0152 on the skirt of that village. They took me there, cause they thought, she\u2122s alone, maybe she will take the baby. So one year old baby \u0152 I mean, one day old baby \u0152 this is very important and that\u2122s why I repeat it, you know, they put me on her steps. I was screaming. She opened the door, she saw the baby, she took me in. So this was \u212243. I was in her house until \u212245. No idea how \u0152 how \u0152 what happened during this time. I might suspect that when I was crying, she was beating me up, because, you know, she was scared, too. So, actually \u0152 okay, of course, there was no milk. I was feeding, you know, with potatoes and wate r. I don\u2122t know how this happened that I survived. It\u2122s \u0152 I\u2122ve talked to the doctors, they say they never heard about such a thing. But anyhow, what happened during th ese two years, my mom, of course \u0152 my father was in a forest, hiding there. And my mom was very depressed. She was 19. She lost her baby, which she never touched. She didn\u2122t have parents and family. So she, one day she decided to go where they were hiding to see her mom and her dad. And the people who in the meantime took over our houses, our land, these people saw d \u0152 her going there. And they let know to the police \u0152 Polish police, which was 6 working very close with Gestapo, and th-the Germans came, killed almost everybody immediately. My two uncles, they were not there, they were hiding in the fields. So my mom, apparently that they \u0152 they didn\u2122t kill her at once, but she was hurt badly. And a few years ago, I went there. I was told not to by many people, because the people living there, they remember the fa mily. They stole everything which belongs to us, and I was told it\u2122s dange rous to \u0152 even to be around, especially that I look hundred percent like my dad, so I am very easy to recognize. But I did, I go, I did go there. And I saw \u0152 I met li \u0152 a lady who was \u0152 I was just asking million questions, you know, and just between one sentence and the other, she told me about my family. I couldn't believe my ears, but I \u0152 I didn\u2122t even ask about the family. But she started to say, oh, we\u2122ve had the Jews, you know, here. There were parents and five kids, you know. There was one \u0152 one girl and four brothers. And that girl, she had a baby that\u2122s \u0152 the la dy is telling me, you kn ow, I am standing in front of her. And \u0152 and she says, but that baby for sure didn\u2122t survive, she says. And she says, I will never forget the scene the day they killed all \u0152 all that family, you know, hiding there. And she was not kille d immediately, but she was hurt badly. And she had the long hair. Th ey grabbed her, you know, fo r the hair, and they were dragging her through the main street of that village to the nearest forest. And they then \u0152 she was killed there. And that woma n tells me, you know, I \u0152 this \u0152 I \u0152 I can see like today, you know, that blood, you know, behind this woman. She had no idea who she talking to, and I had a dilemma, you know. I \u0152 I wasn\u2122t sure \u0152 I mean, 7 that was no time to think it over, but I \u0152 you know, I wanted to do something with this, so before I left, you know \u0152 I was with my husband, by the way, he is Polish, and he was shocked even more than I was. And my husband says, let\u2122s go, let\u2122s go, don\u2122t \u0152 don\u2122t stay here. But before I le ft, you know, I ask her, do you know whom you\u2122re talking to? And she says no. I said, I am that baby, and I survived."

He 15 said oh, you know, we were so young, we \u0152 we win \u0152 we knew we had \u0152 we have to escape. What do we do a do \u0152 what do we \u0152 we do with such a baby, you know, we \u0152 we \u0152 we wouldn\u2122t even know what to do. And I said, hey, people you know, go to concentrate camp, you know, go t \u0152 you know , to air \u0152 anything and everything, the family is together. We \u0152 the \u0152 people were dying because they wanted to be together. So there is no way, never ever, that I can understand and forgive. And I told him this. I told him this. So \u0152 but anyway, so I \u0152 I knew I have a family in America, okay? Well, I thought they, maybe they \u0152 they can help me, or whatever. Well, the life in Poland was not easy. One thing I have to say positive about my step-mom. As bad as she was to me as a mom, she was very demanding in terms of education. She pushed me hard, so I had to go, you know, higher and higher and higher. And this is something that, I have to admit it, I have because of her. How much I need it, I don\u2122t know. Well, definite ly it\u2122s useful, but anyhow, with my first husband, I \u0152 I had the first son who died shortly after was born. It was sort of pathology you know, probably, it doesn\u2122t matter. But it still hurt, you know. Then, I had another son, and my son, Robert, he\u2122s gonna be 40 in few days. He\u2122s everything I have. So one day, I, before he graduated from the high school, I send him to America for a vacation, to see the friends, and \u0152 and he fell in love with America. He got crazy about America, you know, he loved everything here. He begged me, Mom, I love this country. Do whatever you can, come here and we will stay here. Well, you know, I have only one s on, and as I say, nothing else matters in 16 my life. So I said okay, I\u2122ll try, I\u2122ll see. Took me three years to get Polish passport, because it still \u0152 we had the communist."

I mean, it\u2122s wrong, it\u2122s false, it smells. You know, it\u2122s fishy. I don\u2122t like it. My son hate it. I \u0152 I go. I do it for my mom. And besides, what I\u2122m doing now is for my mom."
