            "answer": "My name is Belle Mayer Zeck. I was born in Port Henry, New York, on Lake Champlain. When I was about six years old, my family moved to Suffern, New York, here in Rockland County. So I went all through the public schools in Suffern, attended Syracuse University and graduated from Fordham Law school in 1940."

I attended grammar school, Townsend-Harris Hall High School, New York University in University Heights, and the New York University Law School, from which I graduated from in June of 1936, and I have been a lawyer all of these years since then.

                " I want you to talk a little bit about your family background and sort of values that you grew up with. And also perhaps tell me a bit about why you decided to become a lawyer. BZ: Well, my parents were both immigrants \u2014 both came to this country, my father slightly before the turn of the century, my mother at the turn of the century. They were married here and my father was an upstate dairy farmer, but my parents had four children and one couldn't make a living. For four children doing dairy farming, if you know anything about the upstate New York or Vermont dairy farmers, they are very poor people. And so he came to Suffern and went into business, but always had a farm. I was the youngest, my eldest sibling was a lawyer and perhaps that unconsciously had some influence on my going to law school. I was also a child of the Depression and it was quite clear, 1t was made quite clear to all of us that we had to earn a living when we got out of school. It was all right to go to college, but it had to be a purposive venture. And I was told that I couldn't be an actress. I was also told I had no talent whatsoever as a teacher, so I kind of backed into the law, seemed to be all that was left for me. "

There weren't many women who went into law at that time, it was still a man's field, I suppose it still is today. But actually, I came along just at the right time because two years after I graduated we were at war and all of the men, all of the lawyers, were being drafted. I think they were the first ones being drafted, so that not only was I welcome in Washington, I and other women lawyers, what few there were, we were rather sought-after. Of course after the war was over and we returned to our private lives, everything went back to the old, to the old order and women were not sought-after and women could not get jobs for which their training and experience had equipped them very well during those years of World War Two.

And aside from the work ethic, I can't think of much. The first thing I heard about Germany, as I recall, was in high school. My father used to read the papers and he had family in Hungary. It was then \u2014 it had become Czechoslovakia during World War One, but he had family and he was deeply concerned, as were most of the people we knew, deeply concerned about Hitler. My mother had no family in Europe so that it didn't hit her quite as deeply as it hit my father, but she too was very concerned about what was happening to the Jews in Europe. I can't say it was a daily topic of conversation. It was not until I got to Washington that I became very immersed in Germany and in the war. "

                " Let\u2019s just, I guess, ask Bill similar questions\u2014 WZ: My parents also emigrated, they from Russia in the year 1900. Not together \u2014 they met over here. My father got to live the United States, as he put it, just in time to understand that President William McKinley was assassinated shortly after he got here. My father was in the coffee and tea business. He used to import green coffee, blend it, roast it, package it, sell it both at wholesale and retail. The same also with tea. Not roasting or \u2014 but he would blend tea and sell tea, largely to retail customers. Our coffee roaster, at 110th Street, between Park and Madison Avenue, constantly spewed forth, every 20 minutes, a blast of wonderfully smelling coffee, which dispersed in the air, and it was the best advertising he could possibly do. It would spread over a period of about five blocks. We children were myself and two sisters. Belle talked about the discipline of hard work and that was very much our discipline. If I had to specify an objective of my parents, both of them felt that their three children, regardless of gender, should receive as much education as they could absorb. So that \u2014 I told you about my college degrees; my older sister was a graduate of NYU at Washington Square. My youngest sister graduated from Hunter College and also got a Master\u2019s Degree in addition to her Bachelor\u2019s Degree. As far as the family beliefs are concerned, which I certainly think was impounded into me, and it was the business of honesty, integrity. My mother took care of all of the things she felt that she wanted in her children. My father wanted to be sure that all of the family bills were paid, regularly paid, paid on time. I think things that kept him awake at night, if at all, other than possibly health factors, was getting his bills paid. And this was a very important discipline and challenge because we too went through the Depression years. During those years I entered college at 19 in 1930 and graduated college and law school in 1936, but I worked regularly each day with my father in his business because he needed the help, so that this was the basic influence, I think, that probably has carried me through this eighth or ninth decade of my life, whichever it is. And the business of honesty and straight talking and integrity is something that I have always looked for and felt and tried to practice, even in the business of politics, 1f you will. "

                " Perhaps you can tell me what you knew about what was happening in Europe. WZ: In Germany? Well, I did enter college in 1930, and Hitler was beginning to scratch around and make his presence felt in one fashion or another in 1931 and '32. Hindenberg! was in charge at government, Hitler was pushing in that direction. I didn't know too much about the pre-1930 period, during Hitler's Munich and post-Munich, because it wasn't part of any of my studies, and I was very much involved both with the work I did at home and with my great desire to play shortstop for the New York Yankees and also be a member of the United States Davis Cup tennis team, you see. But once we got into the college level in our history courses and our political science courses, we knew what was happening in Germany, and it was neither pleasant nor pleasurable; but actually, we didn't regard it as a great threat until in the middle '30s we began to realize that the Hitler program was a definite threat to the Jews of Germany and when we began to realize also in the middle '30s his appetite for spreading pan-Germanism, we began to be very unhappy about what was happening in Germany. ' Paul von Hindenburg (1847-1934), President of the Weimar Republic. Belle, as she told you, had some family left in Hungary. As far as I knew, none of my father's family \u2014 he was the youngest child \u2014 came here in 1900, so we didn't have any family that I knew of in Europe and we didn't have that to concern us. My music was very important in our home. Under duress I studied the violin for six years. Both my sisters played the piano. My mother had a lovely singing voice and we did a good deal of singing and so forth. Music's been very important to us. My father used to buy numbers of \u2014 he loved the Italian tenors, particularly Caruso,\u201d and he loved some beautiful tenors who were cantors. We had all kinds of music in the house during that period. "

During my school years I would go to grammar school from nine until three. I would come home at three, I would have a snack and from four to five I would play the violin, with my mother glaring at me to see that I was giving her a full hour, except for five minutes she allowed me to go to the bathroom. At six o'clock I went to Hebrew school, the Harlem Hebrew Institute at 111th Street between Lexington and Park Avenue, and I spent two hours there each day. So that this was a full day of education for kids of that era and education was the principally important thing in raising children of those years. I was Bar Mitzvahed at the usual age, and gradually after Bar Mitzvah I worked my way out from under both the violin and Hebrew instruction. I was finished with all of that. But we had in those terms with a pretty full Hebrew education. As a matter of fact, I can probably sit here and write Yiddish while you speak English, writing Yiddish and translating as we go along.

                " And I'd like to pick up with what you were doing in Washington. You said that after law school you went to Washington? BZ: \u2014 Well, two years after I graduated from law school, I went to work in the General Counsel's Office of the United States Treasury and the General Counsel, then Randolf Poll(ph), assigned me to a fairly new bureau called Foreign Funds Control. It was in charge of administering the Trading With the Enemy act. And that act, of course, as you know, forbade all communications, transmittals, remittances \u2014 any dealing whatsoever \u2014 with Germany. Then, as Germany successively occupied Austria, Poland, Scandinavia, the Benelux countries, and France, with each invasion the Trading With the Enemy act was extended to that country, so that by 1941, before I got to the Treasury, all of Europe and Britain was fairly well \u2014 it was insulated to the extent that we could insulate them, to the extent that we could prevent Hitler from getting any use of Germany's external assets. Those external assets, I may tell you, were mainly held by I.G. Farben, the giant chemical company which had offices and factories all over the world \u2014 certainly in every major capital of the world \u2014 and I. G. was, they were consummate artists at camouflaging their holdings. They had had a bad experience in the first World War where several assets which they had in this country had been vested by the Alien Property Custodian. So beginning as early as 1936, they made a \u2014 they began a concerted effort to transfer out any holdings which they had here into the names of nominees who would cloak their assets for them. I was, in the course of my work at Foreign Funds, I was assigned to the investigation of German assets in this country, specifically General Analine and Film, which was, I think, their largest holding in this country. But they had so many other participations and holdings in so many companies, I won't recite them all. And then they, if they didn't own three nominees, through Americans, through Swiss, if they didn't own controlling or majority interest in companies, they had arrangements with American companies such as Standard Oil of New Jersey. And they formed new corporations with nominees for their half interests and with the other half being held by the American company, mainly Standard Oil. I started to say that it was \u2014 that where they didn't have a direct or indirect participation \u2014 they had cartel arrangements with some of the leading companies in this country which permitted them the use of patents in Europe and, of course, in the first instance it was difficult to prove, as I said, because of all these cloaking arrangements, pooling agreements, option agreements, and these sophisticated financial devices. It was difficult to prove ownership. Once we did though \u2014 and this was slightly before the Alien Property Custodian's office was established in the Justice Department \u2014 once the Treasury felt it had a very strong case and once it had penetrated these layers and layers of nominees and cloaks, then the property was vested initially in the Treasury and then the Alien Property Custodian would do the vest and foreign funds control, which would just continue to freeze assets wherever we could show that they were beneficially controlled by the Germans.

Farben 's assets. How did you go about that? BZ: Well, Treasury had, to begin with, lists of known German concerns in this country, possibly not just from World War One, but from the ordinary sources, ordinary commercial sources and of course, it became more a matter not of identifying the company, but of proving that it was German because by then they had been transferring shares. I mean, we knew the General Analine and Film had once been a German company, but now these shares were in the hands of Swiss nominees and the management was American. BZ: We sent investigators into these companies and examined their stock books, their transfer books, their books of account, and then we investigated the nominal share holders of the company. In the case of General Analine and Film, we found very useful memorandum when the army occupied Germany and Bernstein's cartel in finance division went into the Farben administration building and brought back to Washington documents that I will tell you about in a moment. We found a memorandum from von Knieriem\u2019, the general council of I. G., to the members of the Vorstand* \u2014 that is, the managing board of directors of the company \u2014 outlining specifically, precisely what they were going to do to cloak their American holdings in the United States. And as I said before they used very diverse means, very intricate fiscal stratagems and combinations of stratagems. But we had teams of investigators \u2014 this is before we learned so much from the investigators \u2014 on the ground in Germany. We had teams of investigators at the Treasury who were out in the field investigating in the banks, investigating banking transactions involving the Germans and companies and factories all over. "

Justice Department, the Alien Property Custodian to vest it. But much \u2014 and then after about, towards the end of '42, the Justice Department started its own investigations. They had investigating teams in the field, too, because, of course, they were preparing for trial and that required much finer tuning than our investigative reports represented. Then a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, Bernard Bernstein, who was drafted in 1942, became Eisenhower's \u2014 General Eisenhower's financial aide in North Africa and in addition to his duties in North Africa, he tried to find out everybody in the North African theater who had Treasury experience or banking experience, because he was already paving the way for our occupation of Germany.

They called it TWX and he would ask me, in this particular instance, he asked me to send him the names of likely personnel for his operation, which I did in conjunction with help from the Civil Affairs Division of the War Department. These men, when we did occupy Germany, they went into mainly the Farben administration building in Frankfurt, that was in the American zone, and they just took every document that was visible or that they could find in any cabinet. They put them in gunnysacks, they brought them back to the United States to the Treasury, and on the basis of those \u2014 and then there was intensive work on the documents, because some related to war crimes, some didn't.

After Nuremberg, maybe Bill will talk later about the Clemency Commission, but Krupp\u2019 was not only put back together again, but they were given all their assets back. Farben was, I. G.

WZ: There was a special decartelization branch in OMGUS,\u2019 in the Office of Military Government in Berlin, and they did a great deal of investigative work and I think a great deal of work under General Clay\u2019 to break up the German cartels. I did some work, tangentially of what Belle's describing, in Washington with the Board of Economic Warfare. I was in the General Counsel's office there for several months before I went into the army. And some of the work I did related to Lend Lease, I was a member of our interdepartmental land lease committee. And one of the things Belle just mentioned, relating to the trans- shipment of American goods into South America, we were sending, under land lease, goods \u2019 Krupp, after industrialist Gustav Krupp and his son and heir Alfred Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach (1907-1967). \u2019 Office of Military Government, United States * General Lucius D. Clay to England. And England was trans-shipping some of our land lease goods \u2014 intended for them and for the war effort \u2014 trans-shipping them to South America to protect their markets. And quietly a fuss was raised about it by us, and I'm sure the land lease department and finally the foreign officer \u2014 what was his name, Belle \u2014 issued a white paper out of London, discontinuing the practice and explaining that practice. I did some related work at BEW'\u201d as well, in connection with the seizure of patents. I was assigned the business of writing an executive order for President Roosevelt, directing the seizure of enemy owned patents, pursuant to the Trading With the Enemy act, which you mentioned.

This was in the early days of the war, but there would be a time when we were going to be the occupying power and so we established a school at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, indicating the processes and the tactics and the legalities of the work that we would be performing as an occupying power. If, God-willing, we got to that point, you know. And also I knew, with not the great amount of detail that Belle did, about I. G. Farben, whose influence concerned not only the Treasury Department but the antitrust division of the Department of Justice \u2014 our agency as well.

                " Whenever you're ready. OK, Bill, you were? BZ: \u2014 Bill was talking about these cartels and I'd like to say a word about this. Cartels are not businesses, they're arrangements or agreements which divide up markets, fix prices, control production. The way this is done is through the use of patents. Now, Standard Oil of New Jersey is a good example. It had had long-standing alliances with I. G. Farben, which went back to World War One, and they not only had these cartel arrangements but they had joint ownership of about 10 companies in this country other than General Analine and Film, which I mentioned. In the \u201820s, Standard Oil agreed to give I. G. Farben the patents and distribution rights for the production of synthetic gasoline. They were way ahead in terms of research, way ahead of I. G. Farben. In return, they were \u2014 and the right to the European market, where synthetic gasoline was badly needed. In return, they were supposed to get not only the patents for the development of synthetic rubber, but they were supposed to get whatever know-how I. G. Farben had in the production of synthetic rubber. All of our rubber came from Malaysia, 90 percent of it, and when the Japs attacked, the Japanese attacked us at Pearl Harbor, we found our rubber markets cut off completely. In the meantime \u2014 and the perniciousness of these cartels becomes apparent when you realize that from, oh, the middle '20s, to as late as 1938, Standard Oil kept pressing Farben to give them those patents and to give them what know-how they had, because whenever our own rubber companies, Goodyear and Firestone for example, tried to do research in producing synthetic rubber, Standard Oil would say to them, \u201cOh, now, don't spend the money. We have this in the bag, we're going to get them; it's just that they're having a little trouble with Hitler.\u201d Well, we never did get them, but in the meantime in 1936, when all these preparations for war were being made by I. G. Farben in conjunction with the German Wehrmacht,'! the Farben people filed thousands of applications for patents with the United States Patent Office on their own. And of course they were accepted. Every single combination of elements known, they would file a patent on just to be sure that no one else could touch any one of the fields in which they wanted to be pre-eminent. So we had critical shortages, we had shortages in tungsten and in carbides and 1n nitrates and ironically, completely aside from the synthetic rubber deal, a lot of this critical war material was being shipped to South America for eventual transmittal to Germany. I. G. Farben, I really don't like the fact that we always identify it as a chemicals concern. Everybody knows of its size, but I don't think people know how far afield Farben was from say, pharmaceuticals. For example, all during the '30s, Farben produced 90% of the gun powder, and certainly during the war they produced 95% of the explosives that were used by the German army. There isn't a single bomb that could have been launched without the I. G. Farben explosives. They made the treads for the tanks, they were in synthetics; there wasn't, I can't think really of a piece of equipment, of armament to which Farben had not contributed a vital part. So that Hitler could not have possibly waged war without them because all Germany had was coal and I. G. Farben's chemists, who Joe DuBois!\u201d who was the head of the Farben trial team, called the devil's chemist,!\u2019 which they could not translate. They could take the coal and mix it with water and air and make all of these synthetics. So that \u2014 and what they could '! Armed Forces (German).

'5 The interviewee is referring to DuBois\u2019s book The Devil\u2019s Chemists. not make, because they were Germany's largest source of foreign exchange and hard currencies, namely dollars and Swiss francs, they got from their far flung enterprises. They knew what, the I. G. Farben people knew what Hitler was all about. They were responsible for his rise to power. They attended a meeting in, at the invitation of Goering'* and Krauch,!\u00b0 one of the defendants. They attended a meeting at Goering's house in February of 1933, early 1933. That is a very significant meeting; Flick'\u00ae and Krupp were there too. It's a significant meeting because just before that, just a few months before, the Nazis had been badly beaten in the elections. Then came this meeting and Hitler spoke at great length, I have the translation here; it's not a very good translation either, but Hitler spoke for well over an hour, two hours and in it he outlined very clearly his plans for Germany. He said that Germany's destiny was inextricably intertwined with that of a strong man. He went further, he said that it was only through military conquest that Germany had ever been great, led by a strong man. He talked a little about \u2014 for Hitler half an hour was little \u2014 he talked about the threat of communism, and of course that was the big bogie man for German industry as it has been for industry everywhere. And he magnified the communist threat enormously. In fact later, when the Nazis burned down the Reichstag,'\u2019 they blamed it on some poor homeless man who they claimed he set the fire. He was a mentally incompetent, but they claimed it was a communist '4 Hermann Goering (1893-1946); Commander-in-Chief of Luftwaffe, President of Reichstag, Hitler\u2019s designated successor. 'S Carl Krauch (1887-1968), Nazi Military Economy Leader and professor of chemistry. '6 Friedrich Flick (1883-1972), industrialist and Nazi supporter. '7 Parliament (German). plot to burn down the Reichstag, all of which history proved to be incorrect. However, back to the meeting. The \u2014 I. G. Farben ended up making the largest contribution of the night \u2014 400,000 Deutschmarks, which, let' say at the rate of four to one would be over a million and a half dollars back in 1933, was a stunning contribution. However, one of our judges said, \u201cWell, we have fund raising for our people, too. There's nothing wrong with politicians and fund raising.\u201d However, after that meeting, Farben directors approached Hitler to find out what his attitude was towards their experiments with synthetic gasoline and synthetic rubber and when Hitler said that it was indispensable to his future plans and gave them the go ahead, they then, the Farben directors, persuaded von Hindenburg to resign and made Hitler Chancellor of Germany.

I was talking about what Farben had done in the way of stockpiling for Hitler and critical war material, about their supplying him with foreign exchange to buy that which he didn't have or couldn't produce in Germany, but all and also to show its worldwide influence, but it still didn't impress one of our judges who was reported to have said that he couldn't see the difference between I. G. Farben and our own Dupont. Well, we were not\u2014incidentally, I could have told him the difference between I. G. Farben and Dupont. I could have told him the difference between German industry and American industry because German industry was his enthusiastic partner for a decade before he ever started his wars, whereas in the United States, even after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Roosevelt had to bribe our businesses to convert to war production by way of tax breaks and tax incentives. To get back, we felt that we had to show the size of I. G. Farben and demonstrate its worldwide influence for the purpose of indicating what a necessary partner they were to the entire Nazi enterprise, and I would just like to quote a few, two short sentences from Telford Taylor,'\u00ae who was our chief counsel of the subsequent proceedings. From the opening of the Flick case \u2014 Flick was the coal baron \u2014 he said, \u201cAt the threshold of this case and because of its unusual character, it is vital that these principles be clearly understood. '8 Telford Taylor (1908-), American Chief of Counsel for War Crimes at Nuremberg. The defendants were powerful and wealthy men of history \u2014 of industry\u2019? \u2014 (pardon me), but that is not their crime. We do not seek here to reform the economic structure of the world or to raise the standard of living. We seek rather, to confirm and revitalize the ordinary standards of human behavior embodied in the law of nations.\u201d So I think if you have any more questions, this was I. G. Farben preparing for war. Then there came a point when I. G. Farben decided to build its fourth synthetic rubber plant at Auschwitz. They did it because of the availability of cheap labor in the form of concentration camp inmates. It is estimated that in the construction of this enormous plant, in the construction alone, 25,000 workers died. These workers were very, very badly treated and the plant was run with the help of the SS. In other words, there were SS guards in every part of the factory. Not only that, but the SS brought the concentration camp inmates from Auschwitz to the factory every day and I. G. Farben gave them receipts. They paid them, they paid the SS a dollar per man, a dollar a day, 75 cents for a woman and 50 cents for a healthy child, the child that could work. Then the SS complained that 1t was too dangerous to move these people over such a long road, that there was a danger that they could escape, no matter how many guards they put on. So Farben, in conjunction with the SS, recommended that Birkenau be built. It was closer to Auschwitz proper and they built the crematorium, the gas chambers and the crematorium right into the building so that after the inmates, and there were French and Belgian and Gypsies there, so that after they were gassed, their bodies could be disposed of immediately in the ovens. That's why Birkenau has always been referred to as the four '\u00b0 Tt should be clear that the interviewee corrected herself and meant to quote the word \u201cindustry\u201d and not \u201chistory.\u201d chimneys or five chimneys of Auschwitz. In fact it was the title of the book by Olga Lengyel.\u201d\u00b0 But to get back to the slave labor operation, the longest sentence meted out on the slave labor count was seven years and another defendant got four years and two other defendants got two years, which was the one part of the decision that I could not rationalize in any way, shape, or form. It was just a very arbitrary thing and then of course, all of the sentences were commuted by McCloy\u2019s Clemency Commission, which Bill may want to talk about later. "

When I did get out as a civilian, the only job I was interested in getting was a job in Nuremberg.

And I was promptly hired and went over there in March of 1946. "

                " Why were you so eager to go to Nuremberg? WZ: I was eager to go to Nuremberg because \u2014 and not only eager to go to Nuremberg, but eager to work on an I. G. Farben trial, because I'd had contact with it in my work at the Board of Economic Welfare before I got into the Army. I was \u2014 I think being Jewish certainly had something to do with my eagerness to go there and since I had really been out for well over somewhere between four and six years, I had no law practice to go back to and I was interested in going to federal government again, and this seemed the place to do it and to do, be part of the prosecution. So I went over there and what I found there was a few quick observations I made. All of the people working on the IMT case \u2014 and just to set the time for it, this was the end of March of 1946 and the IMT trial ended in September of 1946. The people working on the prosecution staff were virtually all in uniform, either Army or Air Force or Navy. The people who worked subsequent proceedings were all, excuse me, former military people now in civilian mufti. And I went over with the first group of lawyers hired for subsequent proceedings and there were 12 of us on the ship which interestingly was called the General Taylor, but apparently it wasn't named after Telford Taylor. When I received a call to report to the port to get on the ship I was told that the ship is the USS General Taylor and I said, \u201cOh, my goodness, has he received a promotion,\u201d you know, because he'd been Colonel Taylor, but obviously it was a different Taylor. In any event, we formed a very close knit group on that victory ship. There were also some women going over as stenographers. There were a few former Germans who were going over as translators. We talked about the obvious things, things we'd been doing in recent years and what we hoped to do when we got over there. When we did get over there, there wasn't very much for us to do because the IMT trial was on, everybody working was concerned with it. We didn't know whether there would be a second international trial of industrialists, but my interest, Telford's interest certainly was, in beginning to research for one kind of a trial or another involving the I. G. Farben people. I did sit in for a number of days between April and June on the IMT case, became familiar with the identities of the defendants, the people in the dock, also trying to get organized with respect to I. G. Farben. There were then only two of us who wanted to work the I. G. Farben case. One was a lawyer from Virginia named Jim Heath,\u201d who'd been a railroad lawyer, whose father had been the counsel to the Southern Railroad. And we knew, the thing we did know as background matter was Bell's report to the Kilgore Committee, which was Part seven of that series of documents, and we also had a Part 10 which detailed in narrative form some of the exhibits that they used. And then we began looking for documents because we had reason to believe that there was an I. G. Farben document center in Frankfurt. There were German documents in Berlin. All of these were captured documents. And there was one, what was the name of that little town outside of Frankfurt, Belle? Down by, no, down by Hoechst? No, I'll think of it. In any event, went to all of those places, couldn't find significant I.G. documents. By the time June arrived, it seemed reasonably clear that we wouldn't have a second international trial, although Telford was not sure of it and I'd exhausted all the possible sources of Kilgore documents. So we decided that I'd go to Washington to look for Kilgore documents because the people on that investigating committee were Justice people, Treasury people, War Department people \u2014 a limited number. And he said, \u201cWhile you're there, while you're looking for those documents, please open a document center in the Pentagon for the high command and general staff on military cases and also on SS cases.\u201d And he said, \u201cwhen you 71 James E. Heath; Chief Counsel for the Farben trial team during its initial stages of preparation. get there, you can work with Mickey Marcus, Colonel David Marcus, who is the head of the War Crimes Branch of the War Department.\u201d So I worked with Mickey, you know who Colonel Marcus was, he was the West Point graduate who went over to Israel and was shot because he didn't know the password or tell the password. He was a very colorful figure, both in Jewish lore and in military lore. He was a lawyer who was buried up at West Point, who also after Telford, went back after his hiring the first 12, did the interviewing and the hiring for the remaining civilian lawyers who went over to Nuremberg. So in the months of July and August we hired a staff, did the necessary work to collect all of those military and SS documents in the Pentagon, and then I went to my first love, which was to find the I. G. Farben documents. So I took the introduction to Part seven and I spoke with every one of the Kilgore people. There were I think seven or eight of them I talked to, trying to avoid talking to Miss Belle Mayer, who wrote the report, you know. Oh, they didn't know where the documents were, but I damn well better talk to Belle Mayer. I was not very fond of lady lawyers at that particular point in my life, so I called over to the treasury shortly, at the end of August, and a lawyer named Bob Scott answered her telephone and he said, \u201cYes, this is where she works, but she's in Colorado now on vacation. She'll be back after Labor Day.\u201d So the Friday after Labor Day I called, she answered the phone, I went over there, and we met. And I told her my tale of woe and said, \u201cWhat can you tell me?\u201d In despair I said, \u201c\u201cWhat can you tell me about the I. G. Farben documents, Miss Mayer?\u201d So she pulled open 12 file drawers and she said, \u201cThese are the I. G. Farben documents, at least the Kilgore documents.\u201d So I looked at this tall, blonde girl, had a lot of suntan from her vacation and I said, with a new look in my eye I said, \u201cMiss Mayer, you are a wondrous lady. I'll send over here for these documents from the Pentagon.\u201d [end of side 1, tape 2] WZ: _ It's not confusing, it's just a matter of timing and we'll do, as far as I'm concerned, you call the shots here.

How can we prepare for trial?\u2019 And she said to me, \u201cI don't think you people would know how to use these documents,\u201d you know, in connection with the business of how this young woman was treated over in government, you know. She was giving me back some of what she undoubtedly faced herself. Well, she worked it out that the Treasury Department would work overtime over the weekend and photostat the documents if I could assure her that the War Department would reimburse the Treasury Department for the extra cost and I assured her that we could. And I left Washington on Friday and I came back on Monday morning and there, sitting in four or five large gunnysacks, were the Xeroxed copies of the precious documents. So I telephoned her promptly \u2014 I had to get back to Nuremberg because they were about to issue the decision in the IMT case, I certainly wanted to be present. I called her and said, \u201cThank you for the documents Miss Mayer. Can I take you to dinner?\u201d And her response was, \u201cThe bill for overtime is 47 dollars and you're committed to having the War Department send us a check?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, the War Department will send you a check.\u201d We had dinner and I went back with the gunnysacks on Wednesday, back to Nuremberg. Now it was very clear that we were going to have an I. G. Farben trial and it would be conducted by the United States. No other powers in this case; we were going alone on this case and we desperately needed people to staff the prosecution. So the first thing I tried to do was get Belle, and we were having these telecons\u201d* each week and Belle began to, I guess she began to think about coming over, although the first I realized was when she was asking me on the telecon how much we would pay her, what her classification would be, because she would have to transfer from the Treasury Department to the War Department and that kind of bureaucratic nonsense, you know. She wanted a raise above her present salary and Jim Heath said, \u201cWell, let her have it,\u201d and I said, \u201cHell no, she's not going to get paid any more than we're getting paid.\u201d She came over, in any event, she came over in early November, I think. And she promptly went after several of her colleagues in Treasury who she felt would be useful here and one of them was Josiah DuBois, who came over and became the head of the whole trial team. And he put her to work drawing the indictment, which she did largely all by herself. At the same time, I had a special project set up in Frankfurt with a Paul Dencker, who was the chief bookkeeper of I. G. Farben, and I was pumping him over a number of days for information about the work activity of each of 2 Teleconferences. these members of the Vorstand, so that we had curriculum vitae on all of them from Dencker. And I came back from there, Belle worked on the indictment, and shortly after that I realized that I would not probably be able to function with the new hierarchy of prosecutors on the I. G. Farben case, because Joe DuBois had decided \u2014 he had seen a picture of an ugly SOB in an SS uniform, who somehow worked for I. G. Farben in some capacity, named von der Hyde\u201d? and he said, \u201cI've got to have this man in the dock,\u201d and I said, \u201cThe man doesn't belong in our dock because of the careful selection we've made with respect to background.\u201d\u2019 Every member in the dock was a member of the Vorstand.

When Joe DuBois arrived from the United States of America \u2014 and I don't know what, if any background he had on I. G.; Belle had a lot of background. I didn't know what DuBois's background was, but that didn't matter if all he could see himself doing, fresh off a plane, on the basis of a photograph he saw, was make an arbitrary decision to replace a vulnerable defendant with a guy in an SS uniform, I figured that I'd had enough, you know. Belle was there, there was a new team, another one arrived while I was busy interrogating in Frankfurt, in the coldest winter they'd 3 Erich von der Hyde, Member of Political Economy Department. seen in a hundred years, a man came in off a plane named Morris Amchen, and he looked around and he saw what I was doing, and he said have I examined their income tax returns? So I figured this was another one who was going to brighten my life as I try to proceed with this prosecution. I decided to go home. Before I went home, I was asked to serve as the counsel to the court in the Justice case; the Justice case was a marvelous case. You saw the bones of it in the movie Justice at Nuremberg. They structured that, the story, in terms of the Justice case and I was being pushed by a dear friend, Charlie LaFollette,** who was the chief prosecutor in that case, to come with that court. Telford Taylor called me on the telephone and he said, \u201cBill, with all the work you've done, why don't you stay and help put the case into court?\u201d And I said, \u201cTelford, I am going home, period.\u201d So I went home, and I brooded all \u2014 for the rest of the year and finally decided to sit down and make my contribution to Nuremberg, in the form of that article in the North Carolina law Journal.

And so it was a very slow and quite tedious process. But the reason really, the basis for the convictions was very much more the documentation than the interrogation of the witnesses.

                " [Inaudible]. Belle, your colleague left At this point and you were\u2014 BZ: Well, I want to say first one thing in self defense. Bill made it sound as if my reluctance to go to Nuremberg was predicated on mercenary grounds and it was not. I did ask for a raise in salary, but that was very incidental to the proposition that Schacht and Funk*\u00ae had been acquitted and I knew that it was going to be very hard to convince judges that these nice looking businessmen, these important businessmen, could be guilty of the heinous crimes that they committed. What did Funk have, a few, some years? But anyway \u2014 and Speer got some years, but the economics people\u2014 WZ: Speer got 20 years. BZ: None of the economics people were sentenced to death or anywhere near it, and 1t was because if these leaders of the economic life of the country had got such light sentences, then I couldn't see them going after these men who looked like businessmen, talked like businessmen, and were really murderers. I haven't even got into poison gas, or gotten into medical experiments for which four of the Farben defendants were convicted and again given very light sentences. The medical experiments which the United States Holocaust 46 Walther Funk (1890-1960); Minister of Economic Affairs, 1937-1945. Museum has so well documented, I won't go into them, but the Farben people sent quantities of serums to be tested on concentration camp inmates. They were injected with various typhus and typhoid serums, which were experimental. They were subjected to atmospheric pressure experiments where the inmates not only died but they, their brains exploded; they died in incredible agony. And our court could give you an example of what, for want of a more elegant word, I will call nit-picking \u2014 took the word Versuch,*\u2019 V-e-r-s-u-c-h, and in its decision the court wrote, the prosecution claims, I'm paraphrasing, the prosecution claims that that means experiment. The defendants claim that it means test. In a criminal case, we must give the favor of the doubt to the defendants. Now if anyone can tell me the difference between experiment and test, I'd be glad to hear it. Farben also manufactured the poison gas, the Zyklon B, and the serum and the Sarin and the Tabun which were used to exterminate the concentration camp inmates, knowing full well the purposes for which it was going to be used, because these were volatile gases and only I. G. Farben, only their technicians, could control the incidence of the gas, the volatility of it. Aside from that, though, I do think this \u2014 again going back to the prosecution, that we came from very diverse walks of life and obviously very different exposures. But by and large, all of the lawyers were, as Bill said, very idealistic, very knowledgeable about the atrocities committed by Hitler and other people in the Third Reich and determined to mete out justice. 47 Experiment, trial, or test (German). Many of us felt as the British felt in London \u2014 that the crimes that these people had committed had been repeated so often and were of such common knowledge that the courts should take res adjudicata*\u00ae of some of these events and acts that had been publicized on a worldwide basis. Take judicial notice of the fact that they were committed, without the necessity of these very labored proofs. And that's where the trials bogged down, because as a result of the problems in the IMT, they'll also mention that the subsequent proceedings were conducted under the charter, that was the substantive law, but because of the terrible problems of the translation and the reproduction of documents, the subsequent proceedings were conducted under Allied Control Counsel law number 10, which said, in effect, that if an original document could not be produced, that a Photostat might be used. That if it were impossible to authenticate a particular document, if the authenticating party was dead or missing or couldn't be located, that proof of the source of that document would make it eligible for admission into evidence. In other words, the rules of evidence were ameliorated because of physical exigencies, while our, the Farben court, our judges, went back to the basic rules of the evidence, Anglo-Saxon rules, would not permit in evidence any document that hadn't been authenticated and reauthenticated. In fact, if I may be personal, and we've been very personal here, this was the only continuing brawl I had with my colleagues at Nuremberg. The case of von Schnitzler is a good point, is a good example. The investigating group that had initially gone into Germany had taken several depositions of 8A matter adjudged; a thing or matter decided by judgment. Rule that a final judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction on the merits is conclusive as to the rights of the parties and their privies, and, as to them, constitutes an absolute bar to a subsequent action involving the same claim, demand, or cause of action.\u201d Henry Campell Black, M.A. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (St. Paul: West Publishing Co., 1983) s.v. \u201cres adjudicata.\u201d von Schnitzler in which he bared his breasts, so to speak, in which he said yes. They described he was the first person to describe the meeting of February 1933, in which I. G. Farben had cast its lot with Hitler. He was the first person to say, once we got the assurances that our plans for developing synthetic oil and synthetic rubber were very much to Hitler's liking, we then supported him in every possible way. And these depositions of his were pretty lengthy. Well, somebody on our trial staff said, \u201cOh, you can't introduce this document because of some technical flaw,\u201d very minor and so Drex Sprecher went back and he again examined von Schnitzler after all these years, after von Schnitzler had been sitting in jail, talking to his former colleagues and undoubtedly taking a beating from them for the candor with which he had spoken two years earlier. And he said, he didn't exactly retract but he said that he didn't know what he was saying because he said \u2014 now I'm quoting, \u201cI was terribly\u201d (quote) \u201cdepressed at the time.\u201d He recanted. Eventually Drex went back to him and he finally said, \u201cWhat I initially told those people in Frankfurt in 1944 or '45, I forget which was the truth.\u201d\u2019 But I mean this constant revisiting of a document \u2014 don't forget that in the Farben case, over 2000 documents were introduced. That doesn't include the interrogations of the defendants and of other employees of I. G. Farben, who had written very damning memos to the board of directors. So I would like to comment on something else, because I don't think that young people today, even lawyers, can begin to visualize the mechanical difficulties under which we were operating. We did not have modern Xerox machines, copying machines; we had these old photo copiers, which were a wet process and they had to, you had to use this thin copy paper which came out and curled at the edges. Now we were required to give the defendants\u2019 copies of all of our exhibits 24 hours in advance of their introduction. This called for a very strict trmetable. In the meantime the mimeograph people \u2014 I didn't mean photocopying, I meant mimeographing. The mimeograph people were working double shifts, but even so, they couldn't handle this volume of business. We never were able to get things from them on time. Instead of having our own duplicating machines, we had to rely on this pen. The mimeograph \u2014 pen is not the right word for it but \u2014 they were 1n isolation and somebody would hand them something, it could be a Rand McNally atlas with a hundred pages of charts. We also had to assist the defendants 1n locating things they considered material to their defense, which they did not have the means to locate, so that half the time we were working for the defendants, assisting them. I felt these were the only brawls we had, that we were leaning backwards to show how fair we were being. Charles LaFollette, whom Bill mentioned, the former congressman from Indiana \u2014 Bill described his role in the case, the Justice case and against the judges, the people's court. LaFollette said that, once said jestingly, but with great weariness, that he had always thought that the aim of the trials was to punish the prosecution and all that the trials were doing was killing, to punish the defendants. But all they were doing was killing the prosecution, and there was a lot of truth in that. In fact, we had, I think what the prosecution was lacking, if I may be as frank as Bill, I think that what we were lacking was top-notch trial counsel. This is in retrospect. I think if we had had some good homicide lawyers over there, we might have made a more telling case. As it was, we did have some trial lawyers who came with good reputations for advocacy, who left, because these were people, no matter how primitive our technical equipment, these were people who were used to pushing a button and summoning a staff who would immediately respond. Our typewriters were antiquated, making carbon copies, 25 of every single thing that was done, was just back-breaking. And so we had trial lawyers who just would not stay because they could not operate in this very frustrating milieu. "

                " What else can you tell me about preparing for the trials themselves \u2014 the collection of evidence, who helped you in that endeavor? BZ: Well, we had analysts, translators, and we would tell them what we were looking for. I had done a draft of a trial memorandum but I'm wondering how many people on the trial team was following it very rigidly, because frequently we would send off an analyst, say to Berlin document center because we felt that certain points we were going to make, needed some bolstering. And they would go to Berlin and these people did work, but they would decide what they wanted to prove and they would come back with documents which they considered really incriminatory, but they were not the documents you sent them for. There were analysts, there were stenographers, there were people to whom one gave documents already in one's possession and asked them to give you a digest of them. So this was the staff, there were lawyers, analysts, stenographers and then these kind of separate omnibus groups, like the mimeograph people. WZ: We did use Germans. The Germans were eager to work because they would get a decent ration, you know, and they weren't in policy positions. They did mechanical work, you know. And they mounted mechanical work required, you can gather from Belle's description, of the movement of the document from a cave in which it was uncovered by the army and its intended use by an attorney after the document had been translated, and so on and so forth. And then it had to be gotten into the hands of the defendant. It was a very, very, very difficult operation. I must say this, I don't intend really to sound sour on the Nuremberg activity, regardless of how I felt and why I left when I did. Three things I think must be mentioned: Number one, the law we established, which provided that a head of the government could be prosecuted as a war criminal, was brand new. Nobody ever thought of trying the Kaiser\u2019? or I don't want to speak about Napoleon because it escapes me at the moment, but that is now accepted international law. Number two, with respect to superior orders, it has always been, in the American order of battle, that you obeyed the order of the superior officer and if that superior were a corporal or a sergeant or a captain or a general, his order was sacrosanct. As a result of Nuremberg, our order of battle was changed to provide you had to obey only the lawful order of a superior officer. So now, even the private is invested with a policy gene. He has to obey what he's ordered to do, but not if he's ordered to kill babies and defenseless people, as happened in the Lieutenant Calley case in... BZ: \u2014 Vietnam. WZ: Vietnam. So those two things, and perhaps the most important thing \u2014 and I certainly did not go to Nuremberg for the purpose of creating a history. I went to Nuremberg with the purpose of establishing certain law with respect to initiating and waging aggressive war. And I don't feel that we were successful, basically, in that respect, but we established a * Emperor (German). history and all the skinheads that can be collected on anywhere and all the naysayers have to face the history, the transcripts of the Nuremberg trials, the volumes \u2014 several different sets of volumes, the first one on the IMT, a terrible volume, 42 of them, the blue back, and so forth. But this kind of thing \u2014 and mine is not a document recital \u2014 but those compilations, which largely Drex Sprecher was the head of editing and gathering, that's been Sprech\u2019s career, really have been on file in European countries and in libraries and the Library of Congress, of course, and in law libraries all over the United States of America. And that is not policy stuff, that's historical fact. Fortunately most of it\u2019s supplied by documents maintained by the Germans themselves. So that to me is the warming aspect of my recollection of Nuremberg. It was a terrible place in which to work and if when they didn't pay attention to you, you formed a softball team and you played out where Hitler used to conduct his meetings in the, what was the\u2014 BZ: \u2014 Sportpalast(ph). WZ: Sportpalast, yeah. And you sat around and you talked and you talked about many, many things, but you did an enormous amount of reading of documents and so forth. And \u2014 but the history of Nuremberg is something that pleases me very much. It was worth all the \u2014 there was a good deal of agony involved in doing that work over there, no question about it. So I'm glad I was associated with it. BZ: \u2014 And it certainly is the answer to the revisionists. "

When they'd get back from Germany, they would bring me up to date, but there were brawls that were reported in the newspapers, in the New York Times and in other publications. For example, Judge Morris at one point asked Drexel Sprecher how many more documents he intended to put in and Drex said ,\u201c*500,\u201d and Morris just plain had a fit. He said, \u201cWe're going to be here for another year\u201d and, \u201c\u201cWhy can't you curtail your evidence?\u201d and \u201cYou're bringing in everything including the kitchen bathtub.\u201d And he really reamed Drex out in a very injudicial manner.

I think it might have been better if we had led off with Slave Labor or some of these atrocities which might have created some interest in Morris. It would have been extremely difficult but that was the sort of thing that would throw you off base and you'd have discussions about it until all hours. Discussions of strategy and how to cope with a couple of the judges, who were obviously hostile. Then again I might have had an advantage, Randy, not only because of my sex but I might have had an advantage in that I was one of the first to lead off with a presentation of the prosecution's case, so that their patience might have been in better shape at that time. WZ: I think, and this is all in retrospect, on the political side, I hadn't any idea how the judges were selected to sit on particular cases. I know generally that the way the judges were selected here in the United States. The chief judge of the United States Supreme Court refused to let any Supreme Court judges come over, he refused to let any District Court judges to come over, so that you really got a potpourri of people from various states of the country. However, just as cautious as we were in the selection of the prosecution staff for I. G. Farben, for example, and I think basically for better or worse, we felt that the best people we were getting would go to I. G. Farben and the other industrialist cases, if those lawyers wanted to work those cases you see. There should have been some technique for evaluating which judges were better prepared to serve on an I. G. Farben case, for example. Paul Hebert belonged there, Morris of North Dakota, obviously didn't belong there and you know, I'm speaking without knowing any of these people but from what I've heard. That part of the process was faulty, but if you suggested that to Telford Taylor, he would possibly say, \u201cLook at what we had to do to get a document translated,\u201d you know, and delivered to the defendant and so on and so forth. And of course it was very, very \u2014 the difficulty in the whole operation, having sat on the Supreme Court of New York for 10 years myself and having since my retirement spent a good deal of time looking at the two because nobody wants anyone of any age to go to his grave without having sat 500 hours watching the O. J. Simpson case, you know. The selection of judges is part of the function of an administrative judge, who ought to know his people and their backgrounds and their predilections sufficiently to assign them sensibly to cases. This was beyond comprehension in Nuremberg and probably beyond having being able to work out. But I don't know what kind of curriculum vitae Telford Taylor had with respect to each of the 33 judges who came over, but it would seem to me that somebody made these assignments and I can only assume that they were made on a helter-skelter basis, which was unfortunate. BZ: That's true, they were picked on the basis of their volunteering to go. Now, that didn't mean that we didn't have some very good judges. Out of our personal knowledge, I think that we could name them. And when I say good judge, I don't mean that they should have been given the litmus test for whether they were for the prosecution or against the prosecution. I think, though, that they did require a degree of sophistication. I feel they should have had background on the whole German gestalt, the whole German business. If nothing else, the rise of Hitler, what he did, who he was, how he succeeded in taking over an entire continent and how he almost succeeded in taking over the rest of the world. WZ: And what kind of work these judges did as lawyers, what their backgrounds were. BZ: And how skillful they were in handling a trial of this really great significance, great importance. "

But there was a tension, a very important tension that was created by the shift in our policy towards the Soviet Republic.

There is a wonderful picture of which I do not have a copy and that is the picture of the prosecutors as the decision is being read by Shake, and they say a picture is worth a thousand words, you can see the shock and the dejection of Sprecher and DuBois and Amchen and the others, Linscott(ph). It was a very telling picture. If the museum doesn't have it, 1t surely should get it, but of course I was just stunned by the decision. Then it was eventually \u2014 when it was reproduced, but I did get a letter from General Taylor saying that he was sure that I was disappointed and that they were all disappointed but that he had felt that we had made an important contribution to international criminal law and to think of it in that respect. Then I received a full copy of the, of Hebert's dissenting opinion and that indicated that some of our work had struck fertile ground, but it was a two to one opinion and both Shake and Morris were very provincial people. I don't know how much they read or how much they studied, but they, from the outset, could not believe that these very respectable former businessmen could be guilty of such perversion. WZ: Just to include in your record: five or six statistical numbers, in the 12, in the 13 trials, the 12 plus the International Military Tribunal, 199 were tried, there were 36 death sentences, 23 life sentences, 102 prison sentences, lesser than life, of course, and 38 acquittals. When we speak of this disappointment in terms of the sentencing, the impression should not be gathered that there weren't any severe sentences put out. Now, of the 102 prison sentences, that's where I believe that the Clemency Commission did their nefarious work. Obviously the \u2014 those that had been hanged were beyond the mercies of the Clemency Commission and I don't know how many life sentences were reduced. I would think if any, it was a small number, but in the total number of prison sentences, that's where, in my own description, the Clemency Commission opened the doors of the prison without consulting with counsel, without doing anything other than being appointed by the high commissioner and sitting for either 30 or 60 days and doing their job. And this was a job they were selected to do. For my own, for my own pleasure, I point out that of the 33 judges \u2014 and we talked a little bit about whether or not they were carefully assigned to their particular cases, should have been more carefully considered. Of the 33 American judges, no Jewish judges. I don't resent that at all, I think it 1s good in terms of what they were trying, that there not be Jewish judges. There was no lack of Jews on the prosecution stand, but the way in which the Clemency Commission was selected, and I do believe that the chief judge, the acting chief judge among the three members of the Clemency Commission was a Jew and maybe from the high commissioner's viewpoint, or possibly from Washington's viewpoint, I don't know, I wouldn't say Washington in this situation, Harry Truman was the president. If indeed Judge Peck was Jewish, that was also a carefully contrived political maneuver to ease the passage of something politically desired, you see. "

BZ: Oh, unquestionably, unquestionably and that's all understandable, but Cold War politics or no, in my ken, that game should not have been played with these sentences, in the fashion in which it was played, because I don't think it was necessary. No matter what Jimmy Byrnes said in Stuttgart, I don't think it was necessary to get the Germans on our side in the Cold War against Soviet Russia. It wasn't necessary. BZ: | May I say one more thing? In fairness, I must say that despite the Cold War politics and despite the fact that it a gave the prosecution, the various prosecutions ulcers, the War Department held fast until the last trial was over and I think that the war department deserves all the credit in the world for that. We were so sure that they were going to pull the rug out from under us. There was never the slightest indication from that quarter that they were going to do anything to diminish their support of the trials. WZ: Because of Harry Stimson, the Secretary of War. BZ: Well, he wasn't there at the end. WZ: Well, but Roosevelt, however he may be blameworthy in connection with concern with the Jews of Europe during the war, Roosevelt was foursquare for the trial of war criminals. Harry Truman was foursquare for the trial of these criminals. BZ: Well, the State Department certainly wasn\u2019t. That's all, let's not pick a bone about it. "

BZ: Joe DuBois was a very fine administrator in the Treasury Department. He was an assistant General Counsel, he established the War Refugee Board, which\u2014and administered it. And he had several, to use a common word, he had several tickets so far as administration was concerned. And it was necessary \u2014 the reason I recommended that he be brought over was because I felt that the prosecution, in preparing the case, was a headless horseman, with people going off on their own adventures so to speak. I'm not talking about black marketeering, non-case adventures, but where the case was concerned they were going, they were making the decision as to what was important and what to do. Amchen had, in private life, and he had also worked for the government during the war. He had been a trial lawyer and we certainly needed someone who had a great deal of trial experience. Drexel Sprecher had been there from the beginning of the IMT to the very end after all the trials were concluded. He still stayed to edit and publish these sets of books that you're aware of, so that he brought to the prosecution of I. G. Farben extraordinary knowledge of both procedure and a feeling for individual responsibility. He was always very grateful to Bill for pointing out that we had to \u2014 that it was all very well and good to lump all these men into one category under the theory of conspiracy, but that it was necessary to point out where they sat in the organization, what their influence was, what their domain was and what their peculiar liability was.

                " What about the leadership of Taylor? BZ: Well, Taylor was very good. He did, he could not cope with the mechanical problems any more than anyone else could. His deputy was Tom Erbin, who really worked very hard to get staff, to get bodies, to get machinery that worked, that didn't break down, to adjudicate the impasses that occurred between rival teams for mimeographs and duplicating machines, such as they were, antiquated as they were. Pardon me, they were \u2014 it was a tough job, not to mention the fact that they were dealing with, not all, but several prima donnas among the prosecutors. So it was, I'm sure that in my lifetime I've seen better administrations, but I don't think that Telford's great forte was that of administrator, nor indeed was Tom Erbin\u2019s. He was an excellent administrator in private life, but the difficulties were, a lot of them were just insurmountable. "

                " What about moral leadership? BZ: \u2014 Oh, I think there was extraordinary moral leadership. I think that the morale, up until this Cold War business, I think that Taylor could inspire great dedication, hard work and he could rally people to the cause, without any question. Taylor's problem was that he was \u2014 most people considered him rather cold. And he was, Taylor was a scholar, he wasn\u2019t a hale fellow, well met. He had his circle of friends, he was not a good politician, in other words. On the other hand, if you went to him with a problem or if you went to him and just said, as I did, \u201cThis is one monumental SNAFU and I have instructions to leave whenever I don't feel my services are being properly utilized,\u201d he could be very understanding, indeed, warm. And I have letters, which are extremely warm, which he was not obliged to write at all, but also it should be noted that he was one of the most eloquent men, both in writing and in speech, that I have ever met. I mean everyone talks about Jackson's eloquence, particularly in his opening and closing statements which are really, I think will go down in history with the Gettysburg address, they were that touching and powerful. I think that Telford was equally eloquent. WZ: May I get a word in here? First about DuBois. Joe DuBois can be canonized for his devotion to the Jews, for the fight that he made in the face of people like Rabbi Wise,\u00b0\u00b0 who wouldn't approach the President during the war to tell him what was going on. Like his counsel, his personal counsel who was with him every day, Sam Rosenman, Barney Baruch, who sat on the bench and could walk into the President's office, supposedly at any time. The effort that the Jews made to bypass the State Department and get through to FDR 1s virtually this: it is not a proud part in my book of the Jewish history. DuBois got through. DuBois and a few 60 Stephen Samuel Wise (1874-1949), U.S. Rabbi and Zionist Leader. other non-Jewish lawyers in the Treasury Department managed to incite the Secretary of Treasury, Henry Morganthau,\u00b0' to demand that something be done and the War Refugee Board was set up. My little set-to with DuBois about von der Hyde and Haberland\u2122 pales into nothingness against the totality of Joe DuBois's contribution that I know of, to the good part of the war effort and Nuremberg. Telford, I must say for Telford, I've had, I was part of the circle, you know, the circle of friends. WZ: Telford had an absolutely monumental administrative job, because although all of us who were there, were there because we were interested in what we were doing, all of us, after all the years of military service and so forth, had a whole kind of, a mass emotional problem, you know. We'd been away from home... BZ: \u2014 Randy, before we conclude, I would like to read you one paragraph from Telford Taylor's final report to the Secretary of the Army, dated August 15, 1949. It was a report on the War Crimes Trials conducted, known as \u201cSubsequent Proceedings\u201d and I think it is a very useful summary. He said, \u201cImportant as is the concept of aggressive war and beneficent as the Hague and Geneva conventions may be, we can hardly expect much further judicial development and interpretation of crimes against peace or war crimes, except of course in the unhappy event of another war. The concept of crimes against humanity however, if it becomes an established part of international penal law, as it seems to be doing, will be of the greatest practical importance in peacetime, indeed it may \u2018| Henry Morgenthau (1891-1967), U.S. Secretary of Treasury 1934-1945. \u00a9 Ulrich Hablerland, head of Lower Rhine Betriebsgemeinschaft [company staff] in 1943. Peter Hayes. /ndustry and Ideology: I.G. Farben in the Nazi Era (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), 337. prove to be a most important safeguard against future wars, in as much as large scale domestic atrocities caused by racial or religious issues, always constitute a serious threat to peace.\u201d We have seen this happen in Ireland, in Bosnia, in Rwanda and in many, many other places, Burundi and many other places in the world and I believe that just as how we eventually got the genocide convention ratified by all of the peace-loving members of the United Nations, I believe that we will one day see a permanent, international, military court, established under the auspices of the United Nations, with an enforcement apparatus, which will put out these brush fires before they become sad and long sagas of revenge and retaliation and brutality, because as is the case in Bosnia and elsewhere and as I said before, these wars, internal as they may be, which are directed against one religious or racial group, constitute a threat to the peace of every nation in the entire world. That's about all I have to say. "

I think they cause one to believe that there is no higher dedication than dedication to peace and as irritating as we find the United Nations, I don't believe we have any other choice but to support it and if anyone can point out to me a better way, I certainly would be interested.

My life, between 1915 and wherever it goes from 1996, was encapsulated in the twentieth century. There were two wars. I remember as a small boy, being taken to a parade, watching the AEF, the American Expedition Force, march back in 1919, up Fifth Avenue. I was sensitive to that war. When I was four years old I wore a soldier\u2019s suit, which was modeled on the soldier's suits, the soldier's clothing in World War One. I lived through the Twenties and the exaggerated responses to the first World War. I lived through, as a student and as an adult, the 1930s. I have been very well aware of every campaign for the presidency since Al Smith ran against Herbert Hoover in 1928. This history is part of my life, the history of the entire century and the Nuremberg part of it 1s one that is terribly important because I participated 1n it, to the extent of which I participated in the presidency of Jack Kennedy, in the political life of Bobby Kennedy and an awareness of Harry Truman, in trying to achieve a better society through politics, in which I was heavily engaged and so was Belle engaged. And a realization now, at this age, about the beauty and the value of the life of a small child. Nuremberg 1s connected with all of that. I see those children in the concentration camps, emaciated, frightened, wearing their clothes, I know how I want a child to look like and these things all fit a pattern you know. I have no illusions about my contribution to this society, but I don't downgrade or demean any of \u2014 it's had great, great pleasures, it's had very difficult periods and periods of pain and they, they're part of most anybody's life, including at that present time, when the people dear to you, either dying or very close and so on and so forth. Nuremberg was a thing that I'll look back upon with a great deal of pleasure and I have no complications about it. I wish I could believe, because I know the importance of politics in everything that goes on on this earth, I wish I could believe that those people are going to be picked up and taken to the Hague and tried. If we don't do it, nobody else is going to do it. But I think it's, I see all of the difficulties and all of the complications and if Nuremberg 1s less than either of us would have wanted it to be, so be it. But Nuremberg was important in my life and I think Nuremberg was important in Belle's life. Although she chooses to talk of the pain, well she recovered from the pain of Nuremberg. We all recover from pain. I had coronary bypass surgery 21 years ago and I've forgotten about it, but I haven't forgotten about Nuremberg. "
