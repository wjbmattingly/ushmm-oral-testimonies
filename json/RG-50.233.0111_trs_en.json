When I came home I heard from my mother that my brother was taken to prison and when my father went to the police, this is an interesting story. You know, in Germany every year you have different police departments in diff erent parts of the city and when my father came there and he asked by sheer coincidence the officer in charge was a former comrade in arms from World War I, and he said, Fritz Rosenbe rg, come in here for a minute. And he told him what are you doing here, are yo u crazy to come here? I have orders on my list to bring you in. But he said look we fought together in Wo rld War 1, so I said, look, I tell you what I do, you go out this door and don\u2122t go home before tomorrow morning so if somebody comes there you are not home. And that\u2122s what my father did. He went to my aunt who was a lady and there was nobody living there, lived in the neighborhood and he stayed there all night. You see. And that German police officer because he was by sheer coincidence a former comrade in arms from World War 1 saved my father from prison. Mo st probably he wouldn\u2122t have survived anyhow. My brother was young, that\u2122s a different story. But many people didn\u2122t come back from Kristallnacht. They were beaten already wh en they got into the camp and the German SS would you know."

It was no idea of killing them immediately, they wanted the Jews to work, and because they couldn\u2122t send all these people now to one spot. They distribut ed them among different cities. Litmanstadt, Riga, Lithuania, Minsk, a lot of cities. You see, the transport went from all parts of Germany and Czechoslovakia and Vienna and to Litzmannstadt , to the East. The trains were running all the time. We were only one transport. Our luck was that we were the first transport that came to Minsk and was unloaded. Because only the firs t seven transports in Minsk were unloaded. The other 28 were gassed on arrival."

And the minute all the people were pushed in, maybe 100 or 200 people, I wasn\u2122t there, but I read in the book, they would close these big doors and the exhaust pipe would run, this was the first experiment with gas and they would bring them to about 8 or 10 kilometers out of Minsk and by the time they got there the people were dead. It took one hour, one hour and a half for the people to die. And then later on they started with different type of gas. In Minsk was actually the experiment with gas. Started in Minsk."

But because 30 people didn\u2122t show up, she was permitted to go there. It had to be thousand people, Germans ar e exact, they have to be exact. We left the next morning, at the Jewish Community in Ham burg delivered soup and the Jewish leader in Hamburg told us, don\u2122t worry you go to work and we loaded the cars with sewing machines and equipment for you, and with food and you will be we ll taken care of, I have the guarantee from the SS and so on. Where will you go, we go to the East. Well it took four days and when we arrived in Minsk in the evening we were surrounded by very heavy SS guard. We were not permitted to get out, it was November, but we sa w across the our train a train with Russian prisoners, in open cattle cars, and we saw how one or two German soldiers would throw in one bread in each car and these peopl e were starved to death , woul d start fighting and the minute they would start fighting, then SS said mutiny and would take their machine guns and Brrrrrrr. It was the first impression for me. And then the next morning, now I was made a so- called runner from car to car with a yellow ri bbon because there had to be some kind of communication when we stopped.- We stopped three or four times on the way. Some people got sick, we had no doctor, but we had a nurse w ith us, a Jewish nurse. It had to be somebody who could run fast and I was very young. So I had a much better idea what was going on in the different trains. I was only with two more people, we could go from outside, the SS would open the door, and we would try to bring these people to the car where the nurse was. There was no medical things there. But when we got to Minsk, I was also there and Dr. Frank, who was the leader of the transport, a former German officer, a lawyer, the ex-commander of Minsk was standing there and said, where is your leader from the tran sport? So Dr. Frank, who had one of these Spanish little things on his head, you know, said Sir, and he saluted him I have one thousand Jews men and women a nd children from Hamburg and th at was the first impression, then that SS man took his whip and \ufb01slap\ufb02 to his face and he fell down. You dirty Jew when you speak to an SS man, take your hat off. You see, that was the first impression of Minsk. And then, you want to continue, or is that too far?"

            "answer": "They had built it to keep us separate. And when we came to the fence, first we were not permitted to go to the fence, but later on you couldn\u2122t always, you know the guards couldn\u2122t be all over. They told us that thirty thousand Jews had been killed in the last three days to make room for the German Jews. For the Yekkas (?) they called us the \ufb01Yekkas\ufb02. The Yekkas is a typical German Jew. So I didn\u2122t speak Yiddish at that time, I spoke German and these people spoke Yiddish, so you had, Yiddish is a turned around German. So we couldn\u2122t touch them but we could talk to them at least. And we learne d about the tragedies that every day there actions, every day there killings and there were about one hundred thousand Russian Jews, but every day they would kill some of them. We didn\u2122t be lieve it. My father said, come on. My father was typical law abiding citizen and they made Dr . Frank the leader of the German part of the ghetto. About three days later the next trans port came from Dusseldorf already and we didn\u2122t know where to put these people. And two days later a transport from Frankfurt, all with thousand people. And then the SS commander came and said well you can move into the small houses. These were not real houses, these were little from can you imagine in the country you have, where you go for the summer, a little summer house. It was not very big, with wood, and there was a stove inside and tiny rooms, you know, like this, but we did not have furniture and so on and it was cold. But my family and my mo ther, father, and my sister, we moved together with other family, Blywise and Himmelstein to one of these little houses. Then after awhile, after about four weeks about seven or eight tr ansports arrived all together and then the transports stopped. The last one came from Yanof . Then it stopped. And then we started to work, we were picked up in the morning by heavy guard, twenty men, or twenty women. I worked in the German soldiers homes. I had a very good job, I mean, I had plenty to eat, much more than the people in the ghetto. I was permitte d every Sunday to visit my family. SS guard would bring me and pick me up the next morn ing. But most comma ndos only worked during the day and went home to the ghetto at night. But certain commandos stayed on the job because it was impossible to transport them back and forth. I was very luck y, very lucky. First I worked in the German hospital and the hospital was later made into a German home for soldiers so I compared to others and I was able to bring little things to my parent. Sometimes extra soup, if I wasn\u2122t searched. If you were searched and th ey found something, they would (sound effect). I came with an SS guard already and the guard woul d look the other way they didn\u2122t expect me to bring anything in. That was about all together about eight months. The officer in charge his name was Breimeier who for whatever cockeyed reason was very good to me, he killed other Jews, but I was his pet for whatever reason. These people were abnormal, abnormal people. And there\u2122s another interesting stor y, if you want to hear it. One day he told me, he said, Heinz, tomorrow morning we expect some German artists to entertain the troops and I want you to help them with the luggage. So when I went up th ere this one German man said to me how come you speak such a perfect German, are you a Russian Jew? I said no, I am a German Jew, I\u2122m from Gottingen. He said, from Gottingen, __ ____ and this was a girlfriend of my sister\u2122s, they went to school together. So I said, Sir, I\u2122m sorry I cannot talk to you because I am a prisoner here. Come on, how can you be a prisoner , then he saw the Jewish Star and the big cross (?) here. Side 2, Tape 1 He didn\u2122t believe it. And she was the first one who taught me. (blank space on tape at this point) She said, I have heard and been told by SS people that this camp will be eliminated. She knew already."

I don\u2122t mind if you kill all the Russian Jews, but the German Jews are good people, they work, they\u2122re qualified, I want to keep them. And he was overruled by the German high command. Either you do it or you\u2122re out. So he had no choice. But he was in the beginning fighting for, as a matter of fact, there is one German Jew who was in the war with the Kaiser\u2122s son and he was sent back to Germany and I have his book here, \ufb01One German Jew\ufb02. And this SS man went to him in person and said, look, you\u2122re the only one. I will make a personal request from Hitler that you will and he was sent to Theresienstadt. So you see that SS he was later blown up by the Party friends of Russia. Because he hated the Russian Jews. He hated the Russians. But for some other reason he thought he wanted to save the German Jews, he wanted to send them back after the war. Q\ufb02 Did you see some of this like this treatment in Minsk? ",

They couldn\u2122t take the cold, th ey couldn\u2122t take the snow, they couldn\u2122t take the hardships of life. The Russi an Jews wouldn\u2122t have died if Hitler wouldn\u2122t have killed them.

There was four barracks, ac tually barracks for horses, and there were already some people there, some Jews. They said we come from Smolensk. And we got in and there was another SS commander. We were only borders to them. And he said, well you will be here until your transport leaves. We asked where are we going? I do not know, I cannot tell you, you will get food and if you behave properly nothing will happen to you. And one person made a question, I don\u2122t know what he asked, what about our wives?

Yes, he said. Over the two years and then we realized this tim e it will happen to our people. But after three days, Mr. Gruber, the SS commander came and sad I have very good news for you, you can each write a note to your loved ones in the ghetto, and if you have wives, if they want to join you, they will be permitted to join you here. So I wrote to my family, a small piece of paper we had, we got, we didn\u2122t have it and the pencil, I wrote I do not want Erika to come because this to me looks very bad. I wrote in French a nd English, because I spoke a little English and French at that time because we didn\u2122t figure if they would read it. And two days later I got a letter back from home from my family and Eri ca. And Erica wrote, I am coming together with Hannah Lou\u2122s sister who was married to Herm an Haupman who lives now. We are coming. And honestly, after six days about 50 women arri ved all from the married men. Also with the little knapsack. And we said it cannot be so bad if they permit the women here. Maybe nothing to eat, probably, maybe nothing to sleep probably. But when you are in such a state, just to have somebody is already comforting. And that went on until September 14."

And we were put separate on one spot, the 200, some had died, I don\u2122t remember how many made it or not. About 240 most probably. And there were kapos and there were Dutch Jews and they told us where you from? I said we\u2122re from Minsk. They said this is the ______ commando that meant this is the commando to heav en. I said what are you talking about? Well, you will see, this is the commando to h eaven. Do you have anything good with you? I said why? I need this. You don\u2122t need it anymore. They were one hundred per cent sure, these kapos, we would be gassed too. So after a while, we were standing there about three hours, not permitted to go to the toilet, there were no toilets. After three hours an SS delegation came and said, are there any carpenters here? Yes, three ca rpenters. Any locksmiths? Yes. Any plumbers? Yes. Any electricians? Yes. Get out, get out, get out. And I, my friend Herman Hoffman was an electrician, he said to me, if they ask for locksmith next time, get out too. Locksmith? Yes. I knew about it, I was in th e steam room. I got out too. We took Otto Menkin with us and Herman and about hundred peopl e went out. And they said are there any gardeners? Yes. Everybody went as a gardener. The gardeners we never saw again. But we were pushed on the side and we went to a barrack and we had to undress. We had still not prison uniforms but we had old clothes marked w ith ___. So we had to undress. The little thing we had, here, here, here. Nothing. We were searched from top to bottom. Then we went into a shower room. We didn\u2122t know what it was. And we got out and then we came to a room where they gave us each one a new uniform and wooden shoes or something like this and then they said you will stay here and you will be transported to Deshov. So the kapos said to us, that kapos, you are the first group that came in and goes out of here alive. So we still didn\u2122t know what Treblinka was. I never heard about Treblin ka before, you know. But we heard the smell and he said this is a death factory. But you know, even getting from the ghetto in Minsk, even seeing everything, we didn\u2122t know what a deat h factory was, you know. We didn\u2122t know, we didn\u2122t know. So in the evening they put us back on a cattle car to Puchine which wasn\u2122t too far away. Because the next morning we got there. In Puchine was a work camp, a concentration work camp, a very small camp. And we worked fo r the Heinkel factory. This was taken over by the, this used to be Polish airplane factor y, taken over by the Germans and we got there was a small camp and this camp was, there were about 250 Polish Jews and women there. And just before we got there, the SS had executed all the children there by beheading them. And the grave, you know the mothers and fathers had to watch, there were about fifty children. So we got there, the Polish Jews did not like the Germ an Jews, they called us the Yekkas. There was always friction, but they were in command. And we were put to work there in Puchine in one camp and then the next camp. This lasted abou t, I would think, four or six months. I can\u2122t remember I have to look it up in my book.

You see we were one hundred per cent sure that we would be liberated, but they got us out just before they got there.

And only later on did they try to put us really in places to work. But nothing was ever accomplished ther e, nothing. No airplane ever left there. But these were small concentration work camps, you understand. They had SS guards and the SS commandos. But in general you worked from 6-6 but you got soup, proper soup at night and a slice of bread, and because the camp became smaller, it was bad enough. But we got ____ in Deshov.

You know what a latrine is? Women and men together. There was no difference. Absolutely no difference. And we finally, somebody put a wooden plank in between us. And we had very very bad kapos there and SS people too. But we were only there a few days. Because by now we were so called _____ expert work ers. So from Plaszow, after five days, we were sent to the salt mines in Wieliczka, but th ey did not put us to work but it was the worst camp, I think because everything was dirt, you know from the salt and from the prisoners who worked there, never made it more than four to six weeks, they told us. And because they couldn\u2122t use us there, they sent us to a tr emendous German concentration camp in Bavaria called Flossenberg, a big camp, a very big camp. That was in August of \u212244. And there the SS commandant when we came in he asked, we were very dirty and in a long transport for the day, he asked, the kapos, where do these prisoners come from? And th e kapos said they are Jews. He said Jews? Jews only walk in, they go out in the chimney. This was a tremendous camp, very clean, very orderly, but terrible kapos. The German kapos hated us. The Polish kapos, you know. And we were put, just to give you an exam ple, where to undress, this was high in the mountains, we had to undress, we had to run into a shower and this was originally the gas chamber, and the kapos said that\u2122s it.

A nd the kapos hated the Jews, he said good, get rid of you Jews. And the gate is a real commande r today, out. We each got a piece of bread and a piece of liverwurst. And we\u2122re standing and standi ng. I was so hungry I ate, little, little, little, and 5 o\u2122clock the SS man came with a big basket to collect the wurst and bread because the railroad didn\u2122t come. And somebody said I don\u2122t ha ve it. Don\u2122t have it, stand out. So when he came to me I said sergeant, I ate mine I was so hungry. Why do you speak such good German? I was born in Hamburg. Next one. He didn\u2122t do anything to me. Somehow, you know, there was all a matter of luck. From Flossenberg we we re transported to the other part of Germany, Colmar, which was in the French ________, in the mountains. It was in August of \u212244. And this transport was not guarded by SS men, but by di sabled German soldiers. And they told us, they left the gate doors open, and they said the war is over."

It was completely surrounded by wire, barbed wire, you know. You c ouldn\u2122t talk to them. But we saw them. They were all shackled together, foot and things day and night. And they were permitted half an hour to march around in their little extra things . And they had crosses here and crosses here and crosses here, ready for death. Every Saturday morning the truck would come and throw these people on the trucks, the kapos, and that\u2122s it. And then they collect again. We were in the next barrack and that\u2122s why we knew it. And in Sachsenhausen we were put to work. We were put to work to dig out the houses that were bombed by the British or American planes. Heavy guards. But we had to clean or dig or whatever we had to do."

Tape 2, Side 1 When we came to Bremen we were unloaded near the harbor and we were put, not near the harbor, maybe an hour from where they build th e submarines and these things, A small camp with a very cool SS commander who hanged some people there, every day they were hanging. I remember that especially. And every morning at 5 0\u2122clock we were put on a little barge, ice cold, and we were brought to the place of work because it was an hour away. We had to work there. I worked as a plumber or a locksmith, I don\u2122t remember what I did. I can\u2122t remember exactly what I did any more. But I worked. And there were German men who were the people who worked all the time and we had to help them . And some of them we re very nice and others would report your number to the SS and at nigh t you came to the camp and they would call you out and you got twenty- five on your behind. You ne ver knew when, you see. So I only later on I was put in charge of the Jewish barrack and one day I came back from work, the SS commander told me that he had found a knife in my barrack and I would get twenty five on my behind. And every man of the room got ten and every single Jew got one. But I got twenty- five and you had to count. You didn\u2122t count you got the whip. It was given to me by a Polish kapo, there were two Russians. They were the wo rst Jew haters I ever see in my life. They were Russian prisoners. Later on before this camp was liquidated, these two Russian prisoners were stoned to death by the other prisoners. A nd when Bremen came to an end, we again went on transport and went to Bergen-B elsen, the inferno of infernos."

His mother was killed in Minsk. I said, good, your mother is dead. My mother is dead, my mother (sound effect of mach ine gun), you couldn\u2122t stop him. So most of the people from my commando died in Minsk. But when we were liberated in Minsk we were about, I think 10 people left from the 250 people."

So first they had to eliminate all the dead people and then they opened the SS barracks and the soldiers and they made temporary hospitals. We were so sick. Most people died. Ten thousand people died after libera tion. So I was lucky and they brought me to this hospital. My legs were li ke this, with blood clots, you know. But, one day a British doctor came and they called a very expert and he said n o, no, it\u2122s not so bad he will live. That\u2122s what I understood. But then one day the British came around about in May or the beginning of June and said there are transports to Sweden, and we will put you on the transport. So when they asked me what is your nationality, I thought I woul d be proud and say I am a German Jew. He said no German Jews because we don\u2122t know if you\u2122re a Jew or not. I said I\u2122m a Jew, my name is Rosenberg. No, no. So the next time they came around I was a little smarter. Said, what is your name Uh, huh. What is your nationality? Stateless? Uh huh. So they shipped me to Sweden."

The Polish coul d speak Polish, the French talked French, the Italians speak Italian. I couldn\u2122t speak. My broken Eng lish. Ve vant bread, yah. You know, you see I didn\u2122t know at that time. So they t ook us to Sweden. I was unconscious, but when I came to Sweden I never forget that and I saw all these blond Swedish people, they all volunteer. Sweden took in 30,000 people. They emptied out the schools, the hospitals. I don\u2122t know how many America took in. I don\u2122t know how many of Switzerland. Nothing. Switzerland took some and sent them back to Germany. But when I saw these nurses I thought this is the entrance to heaven. I thought really these long tents must be th e entrance to heaven because I was conscious and unconscious. And these nur ses looked at me and they said Swedish language, look at the little boy here. They knew there was nothing here nothing there, 75 or 80 pounds at that time. But what happened at Berg en-Belsen, coming back to the registration in Flossenberg, my cousin, Albert Hottenberg just called, he wa s a high officer under Eisenhower and he liberated Buchenwald and Dachau and wh en he came to Flossenberg and he saw this."

            "question": "He saw your name?",
            "answer": "He looked for Rosenberg, he Heinz Rosenberg (sound effects) and it says Heinz Rosenberg shipped to here. And he traced me to Sachse nhausen and from Sachsenhausen he was able to Bremen and Bremen. Not that he saw me in pe rson, but he knew I\u2122m either dead in BergenBelsen or alive. So we were in these big rooms from the German soldiers. I couldn\u2122t walk. I had diarrhea. I couldn\u2122t get out of bed. So I heard somebody shouting outside. Hey Rosenberg. But you know I couldn\u2122t go to the window, nobody coul d. I come to America a couple of years later, I get in contact with my cousin, my other cousin said Albert lives in Baltimore. One day my wife and I go to Washington to see Otto and we go to Baltimore to see my cousin Albert and he says Heinz, I don\u2122t understand you were in Bergen-Belsen, didn\u2122t you hear me with a loud speaker in Bergen-Belsen. I was very sick, I didn \u2122t hear anybody. I went there with an army jeep with three American soldiers with a big loud speaker calling for Heinz Rosenberg. I would have taken you to Gottingen and made you the Mayor of Gottingen. Honestly that is what he wanted to do. He was in command. He had the whole district. He was a high officer under Eisenhower, because he had jumped while stil l the war was going on over Gottingen in German uniform. He was a typical German. My cousin is a good tall looking man, typical German. He was German. So, I didn\u2122t meet him there, but I met him here. And we are still very good friends. But this other coincidence in life onl y because the Germans took my card and file did he find me. It\u2122s unbelievable. But you see, this here what I am giving you is all written here in this book, and I will give you a book. And, you see, it is very very impossible to explain all the cruelties and all the tragedies and all that went on in these camps because the normal person cannot feel and understand what went on. I happen to be a man who went through thirteen camps. Sometimes I think I\u2122m not really alive, it\u2122s a dream that I am still here. I wasn\u2122t supposed to live. I was in front of machine guns, I was in gas chambers, we were put out again in _______. You can read all this. To tell you my story is not important, but to tell you the story of the six million Jews and fourteen million Ru ssians and Polish and other people who have been killed. It is absolutely a necessity that the world should know what happened. Only by knowing the facts can we build a better world. If we don\u2122t do it, the world will blow itself up. And I don\u2122t care if you are a Jew or gentile, blac k, white, yellow, whatever you are, I don\u2122t care, I don\u2122t mean you in person, the people you see. If th e world doesn\u2122t realize that this hatred and this crime and this dirt has to stop, then they will destroy themselves. I am at the age, maybe I\u2122m lucky, I have another fifteen years, it\u2122s not so important. Bu t, for my children and grandchildren and for all the children and grandchildren in this world there should be some kind of more understanding from all th e peoples to know what went on. It\u2122s very hard to, you know, what should I tell you, how people starve to death, it wouldn\u2122t make sense. This you can read in books. I can only tell you my story and my story is not important. I am alive. But the story of my parents, my sister, my first wife, all my friends, all the Jews from Hamburg, all the Jews from Minsk, all the peoples from all the other co ncentration camps, they put them at the knife for punishment, in the trees gallows, they hanged them, in Bremen they hanged them, all over they gassed them. I am one of the few people who can talk about it. I have a very good memory. I hold this book in order that pe ople should know what went on, that\u2122s why I am willing to give you this book. I didn\u2122t write it for myself, I know the stories, I was there. But the people who were not there, they should lear n from it, you see, otherwise we will destroy ourselves. This hatred has to stop somewhere and there is still tremendous hatred in this world. Tremendous hatred and jealousy, wh atever it is. So I am trying to do my little part in order to bring a little bit of more understand ing and peace to this world. Th at the whole story. I am an expert on concentration camps, unfortunately."

So it\u2122s getting less, you know. That\u2122s why, we the witnesses, it\u2122s very important, a nd I hope that when they build this Holocaust Museum in Washington, and here too, you see when I write to them they don\u2122t answer. You see, they have a very peculiar nasty attitude. If you are not Mr. Wiesel, they think you are nobody. And I don\u2122t agree with them. I offered them my book. Here they build a Holocaust Memorial to ______ I wrote to them, they don\u2122t even answ er. So I figure they can kiss me, you understand. I wrote to Washington. There was a big do in Washington a couple of years ago and I went there because I thought I would meet someone from Minsk. Nobody there. You see you have to understand something, th at being in prison is one thing and being in private life is another thing. Many people use it to become fam ous, to make money out of it. When I wrote my book I wrote to Mr. Wiesel, I said Sir, here is a book maybe you can combine these facts with one of your stories or collect them, or something because your name is better known than mine. Never an answer. At least have the decency and answer. But even the Holocaust Memorial, nobody answers. (Yiddish expression). I sent them the books and I met many Israeli Jews. I think I would not have the good nerve, I wouldn\u2122t have survived. I slept whenever I had the chance. I can take tremendous pressure."

            "answer": "I will give you a plan later on. The ghetto was very big. We only knew, I only knew the German part of the ghetto, especially where the red house and the white house was where we came in first. There was two different parts for the German, Austrian and Czech Jews. We never entered the Russian ghettos. We were divided by barbed wire. We were not even permitted to talk to them. Later on it wasn\u2122t so ba d. We talked to them, the SS didn\u2122t say much. We exchanged goods because the Russian Jews were able to get much more food \u201acause they lived there, they knew the people against us a nd the people would trade their coats and their clothes. We were starving, you see. And actua lly, their kids themselves because they had nothing to wear any more. So the ghetto wa s very big. It was surrounded by barbed wire completely and there were SS guards on the outsi de, on the inside were the Jewish guards and every man at a certain time had to make two hour s at night guard duty. This was not only for people to get in but also for Jews not to run into the wire or do crazy things. You see, the Jewish commander thought it would be better to have law and order in the ghetto. Not to aggravate the German SS or they would shoot ri ght away. And the man who was in charge of this German/Jewish force is the one w ho was later on sent back to Germany."

It was different at th at time. But they had a very good life and I don\u2122t know how happy they were, I cannot tell you. I was a small boy. There were a lot of fights when the factory went broke because my mother was used to a plentiful life and money and all of a sudden there was no money. These I remember the fights between my parents. But she was a very courageous lady in Germany. I mu st say, honestly, I think most of all I have to say one thing, both of my parents were very very fair and understanding people, very modern, very outgoing, gave us, the children, a very very good upbringing and education.

When she was murdered in \u212243, she was about, she was born in \u212217, 26 years old. She had never experienced the joys of life. She had no boyfriend, there was no hope, she had no beautiful clothes, or anything, nothing. Not only had Hitler turned against us, the whole world had turn ed against us. Because she could have been saved, she was a very hard working girl, but she ne ver had real joys. I don\u2122t think she ever had a real boyfriend, I mean yes, but nothing really steady or something like this. And when she was, I know if she was murdered, the same with my parents or my first wife, Erica. The young people, I feel more, much more sad about them than, you know, it\u2122s one thing if I would have to go today, I would say O.K., like my wife passed away six years ago, O.K. I have so many years left but if something would happe n to my son or to my daughter, or to my grandchildren would be much worse. Because the life is in front of them."

Everybody, everybody, including myself, always try, there are so many sickness es behind me. I don\u2122t want to talk about my private life.

He might be th e biggest crook but he thinks he is honest. So you see what really went on in th e mind of my sister, I hon estly cannot tell you. I cannot tell you of my father. I know my father was an outspoken optimist and \ufb01they don\u2122t mean us, we only work there.\ufb02 And certainly all of us expected us to work and after the war go back home. You could not imagine that this cruelty, this mass murder would exist. It was abnormal for the world. I mean I remember that in Tu rkey in 1940, my father told us and my uncle Philip, my father would talk a bout the first World War, about ______ what they saw there, they were young and then the Germans, they fought the Frenchmen. Ooh, ________ my uncle would say. These French people, they must be ______. All nonsense, they killed each other for nothing. That whole killing is nonsense. Ther e goes a soldier and kills someone, doesn\u2122t know who he kills. You take a knife and you want to kill me, I will try to kill you first. All nonsense, war. Makes for the politicians, for big people, not for the poor people. This goes back for thousands of years. The kings always defer, the general always stood behind that you go. He didn\u2122t go."

There are so many people who were killed and murdered and suicide, it comes too far. He was a very good man, very poor when he comes to America. Died of cancer. The funny stories when he was in the hospital in San Francisco and my brother came from England to visit him once more. He visited him and he couldn\u2122t tal k, they had to put a tube in his throat, and the doctor said to us, give him a week, that\u2122s it. You call us. Well, one day I was working and my wife called me and she said Henry there is a te legram from San Francisco, uncle Philip had passed away. Sorry to hear that. So I called the hospital at night when I come home. I said this is Henry Robertson, I hear my uncle, Mr. Phil ip Herz passed away, so whoever was on the phone said, if you wait a minute, would you like to talk to him? Pardon me, talk to him, I cannot understand it. So, he couldn\u2122t talk, but he put the thing, he could talk. He said \ufb01hello.\ufb02 I said Philip, what are you doing? Well, I\u2122m sl eeping. I motioned, I understand that he is dead. Let me see the telegram. What they wrote, Uncle Philip is dying, we need $400 to bury him. You see, but my wife was so excited that she thou ght he\u2122s dying. He died twelve days later. And then they couldn\u2122t bury him and I called the funeral parlor, this is a true story, I said this is Mr. Robertson in New York, I want to send you the money. Well, he said, don\u2122t worry your uncle is happily on ice, he cannot be buried because we can only bury him when the money comes from Social Security. I\u2122ll send you the money. No, no, it ha s to be proper. He was four weeks happily on ice before they buried him. An unbelievable story. There is no feeling. That\u2122s why I do and I considered it my duty to tell everybody who wants to listen to it that whatever happened in the Holocaust, can never happen again. And I will do my damn best when I talk to people I always tell them whatever they want to hear. Most people don\u2122t want to hear about it. I can\u2122t take it, you know. I say you should hear about it so you know what\u2122s going on."
