            "answer": "This is what I want to tell you. I was in public school in the Bronx. One of 35 kids in a classroom. I\u2019m a teacher so that I can tell you from the educational point of view it wasn\u2019t a kind of educational situation for a child that just came out of the Holocaust. I had a number on my hand. In those days in New York they never taught the Holocaust. It wasn\u2019t mandated like in the state of New Jersey. And the kids looked at the number. And they said Sarah what\u2019s that number on your hand. And I said well let me tell you I was in the Holocaust in Germany. And the Germans put this number on me. I wasn\u2019t Sarah Racimora. I was this number. That\u2019s how they referred to me. You talking crazy. There was no such thing as the Holocaust. New York never taught the Holocaust. This was 1954. Those kids were never educated, never heard the word Holo \u2014 what\u2019s Holocaust. Well I didn\u2019t like to talk about it. And I went to my parents and https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Sarah Ludwig 26 August 29, 2013 I said you know what, I have to have this number removed. Because I am just too inundated with questions that I cannot answer. So we went to Montefiore hospital. They got a surgeon and unfortunately the surgeon got sick and they brought someone else. Did a lousy job of this. This should have been just a thin strip. And that\u2019s why I have a scar here. I had it removed. I felt better because the kids stopped talking about it. I went to my education in New York, finished high school and then I met my husband. How did I meet my husband? I went to Moodus, Connecticut. Did you ever hear of that place? It was a place where young people were able to meet young Jewish young men. And I went with a friend of mine. I took courses at Hunter College. And then we went for a week to Moodus, Connecticut to meet some guys. We got there and we didn\u2019t meet anyone the whole week. And then I said, Sunday we were supposed to leave. We had a cab take us there. So I said to my friend, Brenda, I said you know I\u2019m hungry. Let\u2019s go to the dining room. I feel like a salami sandwich. So we went down and I stood on line and this, there was a young man there. He says hi, how are you? What are you ordering? I said a salami sandwich. He says me too. He says I\u2019m here with my friends. He came with four or five of his friends from New Jersey. They were ready to meet young people. He says why don\u2019t you come over to the table and sit with us, get your sandwich. So Brenda and I got a sandwich. We sat down with them. And we got to talking and he says, where are you from? You have an accent. I said well I\u2019m from Israel. He says you from Israel. He said yes you have an accent. I said well can you understand me. I can still speak English. He made a derogatory comment about Israel and I was very angry. I\u2019m a rebel. I picked up the bottle of wine and I was ready to with the bottle. My husband Billy, later on we got married, grabbed my hand and he says put that bottle down. He\u2019s not worth it. Well we sat there and spent the evening with his friends. We had a very nice evening. And then the next day we were leaving Moodus, Connecticut. Dana lodge. I don\u2019t think it exists anymore. And Billy says you know what I'll take you home. Where do you live? I said I live in the Bronx right across the street from Yankee stadium. Oh, he says, I know that area, don\u2019t worry. I'll get you home safe. So Brenda took the cab home cause we paid for that and he took me home. And that\u2019s the history. After that it was a romance. We dated for a year or so. He says you know what I really want you to move to New Jersey. You can continue education. So I switched colleges and I went to Newark State, was a teaching college. Now it\u2019s Kean University and I finished my education there, got my degree from, certified in New Jersey, kindergarten through eighth grade. And I got https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Sarah Ludwig 27 August 29, 2013 a position in Scotch Plains Fanwood teaching third grade. I taught there a year, a year and a half, I became pregnant with my daughter Debby. So I had to stop teaching. And I said Billy I can have some. There was a very nice woman living next to us 1n the apartment house and she said she was willing to take care of Debby while I went to work. My husband says no one is going to take over my daughter. You stay home. So I had to give up teaching. And I stayed home and I raised my daughter. Later on we saved enough money. We lived in the Village for quite a while. We lived there I think ten years. And we bought a house in Livingston, New Jersey, a very affluent community, a Jewish community. And we\u2019re there now over 40 years. My daughter lives in Renalopin [ph]. She has two children, boys. They are now in college at University of Indiana. They both decided to go to the same college. Cody is a senior. Tyler is a freshman. She just took off to class. She\u2019s not even home. And my son became a spinal surgeon in Baltimore, has a very nice group of doctors. Does a lot of traveling throughout the world, educating other doctors in orthopedic surgery. He went to China, he went to Japan. He does a lot of traveling. And he has two children, Katy the little princess. Katy is now 11. Ethan is 13. And they both go to private schools because the Baltimore school system is not that great so they\u2019re both in two different schools. They\u2019re not in the same school. Katy goes to an all-girls school where my daughter in law graduated from. And Ethan is in a school from, very big school from kindergarten through high school. And the whole school, money was donated by Jewish families. How do I know? Every building has a Jewish name. We went to visit the school to see where Ethan was. They have a very nice life. Now they\u2019re traveling by bikes. They are in Switzerland and going through all the other countries, going to be away for two weeks so I won\u2019t see them."

            "answer": "Absolutely. For a very long time I was busy with my career, raising my kids. And I just put everything aside. I didn\u2019t want to think about it. My father brought the video, after he made a video with Steven Spielberg. He showed it to my children. We spoke about it and whenever dad came to visit me in New Jersey. He lived in New York at that time, my mother had died. He remarried a Holocaust survivor, the second wife. And he used to visit so everything else was fine. And we didn\u2019t discuss it that much. Years later, recently I picked up and I said I have to do https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Sarah Ludwig 28 August 29, 2013 something about it. And this is why I ended up being a teacher, being involved in teaching about the Holocaust. I learned from my father\u2019s video which I know you have a copy of that here, the whole story how he saved me. And this was the basic of my foundation for these PowerPoint sessions. I contacted my good friend, Elizabeth Bess who was the principal at a very prestigious reformed temple and we got together and we wrote this program. And now what we\u2019re doing, we are managing to go out and talk about the Holocaust in a very, very educational way. And also in a creative way. The children learn about it. Walking out of one of these sessions that they can go home and say to their parents, this is what we\u2019re doing. A lot of people in the United States, even though they belong to a synagogue, they\u2019re not that educated on the Holocaust. So this is what we\u2019re doing now. That\u2019s why we came out here, Elizabeth and I to seek more information. We found out a lot of information yesterday as I told you about my family. And we\u2019re rewriting the whole curriculum for the Holocaust. Programs that we\u2019re going to be doing."

It\u2019s a Yiddish word and I said I guess I was chosen to survive to tell the story, to come here and teach you about the Holocaust. So you can share it with your parents. Many of these children are not Jewish, where we go. We go to many affluent day schools. Some of them are Jewish, some aren\u2019t. Some don\u2019t know anything about the Holocaust. But the main thing that Elizabeth and I see is that we are reaching that population. When they walk out of one of our sessions they say Sarah, we learned so much today that we didn\u2019t know before. I had them write an evaluation. We went, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with the Princeton Day School in New Jersey, very affluent school. My cousin\u2019s daughter teaches there which is a big plus also. She set her class up for us to give our spiel. The kids were mesmerized. They walked out. They wrote evaluation. What did they want to know the most? Tell us more stories about your father. You, exactly what happened. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Sarah Ludwig 29 August 29, 2013 They loved the story when he put me in a potato sack and he threw me there. What happened to you? Did you survive? I said I did tell them the story. It was very personal and we are getting very successful with it. We work very hard."

My father was the first one when the Holocaust museum opened. With his friends. They got a bus of all the survivors from Radom and they came to Washington DC. He made sure of that. He was a do-er."

I\u2019m very pessimistic to be very honest with you. To see there are no quotas to come into the United States. We had to wait all that time you know to come here after the Holocaust. Roosevelt had a quota for, for the Polish quota. There\u2019s no quotas. Anyone can come in. The borders are open. All you hear on tv and anywhere that you go, all the atrocities that are happening unfortunately. Every day it\u2019s anew gimmick. Robbing people, killing people. The world is terrible now and I\u2019m very sad about it."
