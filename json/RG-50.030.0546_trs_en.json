It may happen in Poland , but it won\u2122t happen in Kolozsv\u00e1r . So my father went up and secured in a \u0152 a room in Budapest, and there was such a tremendous amount of shortage of \u0152 of apartments already. It mu st have been either I was four or five, I have no recollection of the date. And my father talked very little about my life before the war, after I came back. And we moved up to Budapest and all of a sudden we had to share one apartment un it with several families. And I remember that was a little difficult. And my moth er\u2122s father, who had long beard and payos , you know, the usual, sometimes he stayed with us. And in one room my father lived, my mother, I, and occasionally my grandfather. And it was ov \u0152 you know, crowded, and there were some arguments about that. I have very, very precious memories of my grandfather. He always had real deep pockets and always some goodies for me. He spoiled me what ever way he could. And when the \u0152 the Nyilas(ph), which is the Arrow Cross came into power, I remember that once he came home all beaten up, bloody, part of his payos being pulled out. And after that Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 7I never seen him. He came to us, and he ki nd of \u0152 I don\u2122t know where he went, but that was the last time I seen him.

And all of a sudden they knocked on the door and they sa id the Jews are being collected in that city. And my aunt, younger aunt, her name is also Ibby(ph), my mother\u2122s younger sister was there, and my grandmother, whose name was Sarah Roth , and she says, Eva, you are not \u0152 she didn\u2122t call me Eva, she called me Havelah(ph) -- Havelah(ph), you are not listed on the list, you go and hide. And when it gets dark, you will go to the rabbi\u2122s house, and they will send a message for your father to come and get you from Budapest. Tashnalt(ph) is pretty much in the Transylvania section. So my grandmother left, and I was hiding in the fields. And they usually kept the keys, I remember her locking up and po inting where she is putting the key. And I was ready to go inside when a group of Gypsies appeared. And I pretended that my grandmother was inside the house, because they had s \u0152 they were telling stories the Gypsies steal young children, and I didn't wanted to be stolen by Gypsies. And I pretended that my grandmother is in there, and I said, Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 8Grandma, Grandma, the Gypsies, don\u2122t leave me alone. Naturally, everything is in Hungarian. And the Gypsies kind of stayed there on. And I said, just leave me alone, my grandma will come out and she will be very angry at you. And they left. And I felt like a sense of accomplishment. I could fool the Gypsies, I\u2122d be able to go to the rabbi\u2122s house."

I think the food I ate, or whateve r, I became so sick, very soon afterwards. And while I was in \u0152 actually, it was, I didn\u2122t get sick right away, it was like a f \u0152 little while later, because I remember meeting that Mrs. Gross who rented u-us the room. And she told me Eva, come on, I take you back . And I told her, I\u2122m not going back to Budapest, to Hungary. I\u2122m sure my mother is dead, otherwise she would have come and got me during this time. And probably my father was killed, too. I said, I\u2122m going to live in the King\u2122s castle in Sweden. I heard about the woman who took care of orphans in Bergen-Belsen. People were whispering about it, and heard \u0152 I \u0152 all I heard was that her name is Luba(ph). And I wanted someone to take care of me. I wanted to be togeth er with other orphan children. And I said, Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 18I\u2122m sure I\u2122d be able to go to Sweden. And I don\u2122t remember the process going through, how I ended up. Bu t before I ended up going to Sweden, I was in a ho \u0152 for a long time in a hospital because I was so sick with typhus. And there was a British doctor who really liked me. And he says, my wife and I don\u2122t have any children, we\u2122d like to adopt you. And I told him the same thing what I told Mrs. Gross, I want to live in the King\u2122s castle. I had it so bad. I w \u0152 I want some servants, and I want people to take care of me. Well, I \u0152 just before I went on the boat to Sweden, I met the young girl who I connected in Bergen-Belsen, and her mother died. She apologized to me. And she hugged me and kissed me, she says, I\u2122m sorry if we \u0152 any way you were hurt. And on the boat going over to Sweden, I remember there was another Hungarian gi rl who had the sister who was \u0152 he couldn\u2122t speak \u0152 deaf."

And then he said that he was told that she is dead. It happened more often. I \u0152 my father was the type of person who needed someone, and she \u0152 my stepmother, in many ways was good for him. She was a strict woman and everything , and she lost her first husband also, in the Holocaust, so there was something. And my father, when he wanted something, he went after her \u0152 and, very handsome man. And he had \u0152 she had difficulty and Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 22she was alone, and a lot of people connected after the war. And they got married in March \u212245, and my brother wa s born in \u212246, so you \u0152 you know. So it was little after a year. I brought up something when I was interviewed in 1982, I went and asked certain questions of my father, he was still alive. And my stepmother said, you stinker. You were so angry at me, you refuse d to talk to me. And I told her, Mama, I didn't speak the language. All these year s she was under the impression that I was angry at her, and that\u2122s why I didn't sp eak the language. I could speak with my father, my father spoke fluently Yiddish , and if you spoke German, Yiddish was understandable. It was, in a way, typical. She is a very strong woman, and unfortunately my brother is not doing as well as he could be doing in life. And partially had to do with maybe my father being a little too giving in to her needs. And I felt a little bit deserted by him. And mostly I felt deserted because I couldn\u2122t talk about her. And a couple of times I approached him to talk about my mother, and he refused to tell me anything. So, wh atever I found out about my mother was much later, when I connected with my mother\u2122s sister, who survived. Her name is \u0152 was Blanca .

My stepmother was bringing it up a ll the time. So I ended up kind of getting mixed messages, you know. In one hand, they admired that I survived, on the other hand, at home I was miserable. I really was miserable. My stepmother\u2122s mother, who left illegally with her son to displaced person place, she couldn\u2122t stand it there and she came back.
