Professor Epstein, thank\nyou very much for accepting to give this interview. Tell us a little bit about your family. Where\nwere you born, when, siblings, parents.\nGertrude Scarlett Epstein: Ok. Well I was born on the 13\" of July 1922 which makes me ninety\nyears old next, next July and my parents had two sons already. So I was the apple of my father\u2019s\neye because he always wanted a daughter and there I was. So I couldn\u2019t do wrong. But he came\nfrom what was then when he was born, Moravia, in Czechoslovakia. And his great grandfather\nwas actually an illegitimate child because that was during the period of Queen Theresa who ruled\nand very anti-Semitically the Austrian empire. And she introduced a law under her rule, they\nwere always introduced rather, that a certain number of Jewish weddings took, could take place.\nBut once that number had been achieved no more Jews could get married. Well my patrilineal\nancestors wanted to get married so 1n a sense my grandfather was an illegitimate child. And I\nguess if you want to go down the generations we\u2019re all successive generations, we\u2019re all\nillegitimate. And he was Jewish. But they were not Orthodox. And but they came actually from\na place, he was born and grew up in a place, my father, in Boscowice which is near Brno. And\nBoscowice has the oldest Jewish cemetery in the whole of that part of Europe. So it must have\nhad quite a large Jewish community. And there was \u2014\n",

            "answer": "I was you know we lived in this 20\" district which was all Jewish. And when I went into primary school there wasn\u2019t a non-Jewish child in my class. But as I, when these things as I told you, my father was one of the early free thinkers in Vienna. This was quite an important thing. And so he reasoned and because my mother came from very old sort of background so she was very keen to bring her children up as good German. But my father had reined(?) her and he kept arguing that you want our children to have a moral behavior. But you don\u2019t need religion for that. You can bring them up as moral citizens, that they care for what their society, this was the early socialism. I mean and then and he was involved in the abolition of the monarchy. And also he, when the First World War, when the Austrian empire lost, there was no demobilization. Wherever, whoever had survived, wherever they were, the soldiers I mean, they could just go home. Nobody would help them. There was no telephone. Nothing. So my mother was then expecting her second child which was created when he came home on this special leave. So she didn\u2019t know whether she still had a husband, which you know I never could understand when I was a little -- this brother of mine, she always favored. And I always was very jealous of him. First of all he was a weakling because she had been pregnant for then, very difficult period. And I was very strong. I was born in 22, when Uncle Willie was already supporting us. So and he would say, he would sit his children next to each other and he would under the table pinch me and I would go plunk. And my mother would say now don\u2019t hit your brother and he would sit there like with an angel face. He hadn\u2019t done anything. He would, nothing. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 10 November 17, 2011 So he was never my favorite brother."

But then when he was 80 and I was 70, it was no age difference. The age difference disappears once, and he has always been my one. And he has always been very innovative. He has been a fantastic.

Because we only had a very small apartment. When my father came home every month. He was home for at least one week because Yugoslavia had a law that only Yugoslavs could work for Yugoslav firms. So my father was an Austrian citizen and he was working for a Yugoslav firm. So Uncle Willie actually got him a certificate that he was working for a Czech https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 16 November 17, 2011 firm.

            "answer": "Well it was as long as I remember that my brother. That was long in 19, he must have been he was born in 12 so he must have been about 22, 24 so in the early 30s but it might have been before because I only know because he -- a knuckle duster. You know what a knuckle duster. He joined when the Jews joined what was called the Schutzbund which was the organization to defend the social democratic government. But there was a schutzbund for workers and there was a schutzbund for students. And he was with the schutzbund for children. And he came home and he showed me his knuckle duster. And he said I will not just be beaten. I will also return it and I was greatly impressed. But then and do you know we had Dollfuss, does the name Dollfuss. Well Dollfuss there was a in February 1934 there was a general strike because it involved, there was a Chris -- Dollfuss was. You know what I find very interesting, all the partisan were socialists. You had Hitler was a national socialist. Dollfuss and Schuschnigg were Christian Socialists. Every party was socialist. It was the thing to be, but they were quite different from the \u2014 but they didn\u2019t. So we then had the general strike and the Schutzbund the fighting unit was then and what they never told that I mean but the Schutzbund means that. My brother also knew what but he never told them that the Karl Marx, all the top floors you could walk. It was one kilometer, a sort of oval building inside gardens and playgrounds and wash house and you know bars and everything. It was all in it, but you could walk. Of course you could go up one stair and come out another. And this enabled a lot of them, because there was lots of fighting. Now my brother Otto being, having been with the university students come fighting unit, and but he knew my father was, and Schuschnigg. No, then that was later. In 1934 there was a general strike and so there was fighting. They wanted to defend and Dollfuss and the Karl Marx building is a the flat ground, but there is the Hoinvalta [ph] which was a high, when there was a big football ground and this is where Dollfuss put cannon to shoot them so they couldn\u2019t, they only had machine guns. But they fought and so they were -- I was then 12 years old and all the schools were closed. And when I turned up at school, my friends always thought oh there comes the heroine. But this was when the first, that the first should you know kill -- because and also, so my brother had to report because they all knew their players were the reservists. But then my father was already traveling in there as well, so he knew that my mother was home with two small children. So he got permission to go home. And when he came and we were https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 20 November 17, 2011 sitting because we were glued to the wireless because everybody wanted to know what\u2019s going on. And we were deadly silent as my mother was very worried that her son she knew he was with them. And there he came and she was all over him. And he said I\u2019ve only come, leave to find out how you all are coping but I\u2019ve got to go back. And my mother, you can\u2019t go back. I mean she depended on him to help her you know in the household. He was her big help. There was a wonderful relationship. He was very close to her. She was very close to him. He wasn\u2019t very close to my father. So when he wanted to go and was going to there, she knelt. I still, and clutched his legs and didn\u2019t want him to go. And he tore himself loose and he walked out. And we were all sitting you know the two of us, Kurt my brother and my mother was tears and crying. And I didn\u2019t know what to say. And then we heard the first shot and of course we sat there and we thought he had just gone. He\u2019s dead. A few minutes later he came back. I think I wrote this in my auto (phone ringing)"

And but he had a colleague who was also from Vienna, also a Jewish family and they lived in the second district which was all Jewish. So there would be no Schutzbund by it. And he told his colleagues to bring his family in Vienna and get them to contact us that we could stay with them. We should get out of this dangerous because there were times driving. If they saw a face coming to a window, they would shoot and of course we were all keen to look out. And anyway we then went to this family and my brother when we listened to the radio, they then executed some of the leaders of the strike which were some of his friends. So you know this was my first sort of real experience of how awful and how extreme conservative, extreme fascist governments can be. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 21 November 17, 2011 And then Otto said to me, now listen. Little sister, listen carefully. When somebody comes, he won\u2019t tell you he\u2019s a policeman but if he asks you any question, you just say I don\u2019t know. Soa policeman came and my mother sort of just looked at me. She didn\u2019t say anything. And he then said what\u2019s your name little girl. And I said I don\u2019t know. How old are you?

And they got a lift in Switzerland from an English Jewish couple who were driving around Europe. And they quickly established that they were also Jewish because by that time it was also already on the cards that we were going to be part of Germany. And Otto was always innovative. They were driving in a car. And they then went to Salzburg. And of course a Jewish couple stayed in a posh hotel. But they stayed in the new Salzburg. But he said to Kurt look we get up early tomorrow and we wash their car. Make it look clean, sparkling. When they come down they see that. And they saw that and they thought these two are nice lads. You know. Washed our car. And they were driving to Vienna so they took them to the, they showed them around Vienna. We were in Yugoslavia when they were there.

Have, will have to get out and then you walk along and that\u2019s where. What he didn\u2019t know and I didn\u2019t know was first of all, all the Nazi government that quickly took over and welcomed Hitler, was offering free transport to all the Austrians. To come and welcome the Fuhrer. That\u2019s why there were all the people there. And I didn\u2019t know that. But I went on when everybody went onto the underground so I followed. And then I got into a carriage and there was an elderly lady and there was a place next to her. So I sat there in my nice uniform and she said you\u2019re also going to welcome the Fuhrer. And at that point I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to say because I was taught you know a moral way and you must never tell a lie. And that was sort of not, but then I -- and I must say on that day, as I sat there. I kind of, I was catapulted into a little, I felt now I have to make decision, lie or no lie. And that\u2019s what I did. So then when we have got to the circular road and we all got out. There were these masses of people already there. And just then his carriage came and he was standing there. Like you see in the film."

But then when I got to and there\u2019s this Jewish queue in front of the Yugoslav embassy and they all looked at me. What do I do now? You know Otto hadn\u2019t sort of prepared for me for, all he had said was take our passports, get our mothers to give you all our passports and go and ask for Mr. Miderman. That\u2019s all I knew. But he didn\u2019t tell me how he knew him. And you know what should I say when I meet him. So at that point really I became another one. I told my second lie. You know when I saw this and I managed the guard. And the guard, my second lie was. I still remember. The guard said well what do you want. I said I want to see Mr. Miderman. And he said do you know Mr. Miderman. And I said yes of https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 27 November 17, 2011 course. You know but you know at a moment\u2019s notice. And then when I saw Mr. Miderman and he even said how did you know about me. Why did you come here? So I took out my passport and said to him I\u2019ve come to collect visas. He said who told you about me. And it was at that point that I thought, but before this I had seen that he was packing so I thought I didn\u2019t know what he was but he was packing. He didn\u2019t seem resident there. So I didn\u2019t know. Otto hadn\u2019t told me but immediately I said Otto can\u2019t have known him. He is obviously somebody that is going somewhere now. And then he told me he was the ambassador for Yugoslavia and since Austria was no more an independent state he was moving back to Belgrade. That was all and he couldn\u2019t give any visas then. But he said well who told you. And I think Otto. I don\u2019t know how but ultimately you know how he knew. Did I say that in the \u2014 he signed the waivers. We\u2019d been to Yugoslavia. He signed them so he read Mr. Miderman signs the visas. So she must go and see Mr. Miderman. And for him it was simple. But that I wouldn\u2019t know what to say didn\u2019t occur to him. So I thought at the spur of the moment if I say my brother had sent me, he would say well who is your brother. And how do I explain that? So I then produced Uncle Willie. And said my uncle rang me last night. I was lying right left and center. The sort of moral behavior disappeared."

And he was I said to, he is one of the biggest textile manufacturers in Yugoslavia. You must know him. What he, what went on his mind I don\u2019t know but it was that, that he then put his arm around my shoulder and he said well I\u2019ll try and find it. And he walked me to the counsel and just knocked and (inaudible) pushed me in and said I am bringing you a young friend. She needs visas. Help her. Well it took three months, but I went there when you know and then when I got the visas he said, the counsel said well how did you know Mr. Miderman. And I said he was just a friend."

            "answer": "The thing is at that time before that Otto was in England. My father was in Yugoslavia and we, there was supposed to be a plebiscite for the Austrians to vote yes or no, whether we want, Austria wanted to be in West Germany. Now I think now when I remember that crowd that I saw that Hitler needed have no worry. He would have been voted in anyways. But he didn\u2019t wait for that. But all the Jews, by that time, my father knew. I mean he had known that he was Jewish. But he also knew what the Jews were suffering in Germany. So he then knew, you know he must come, all the Jews who were outside Austria, but were Austrian citizens were all making back to Austria to cast their vote in the hope that they would influence the result. So my father had rang us by that time. We had a telephone and said I am just going on the train but just then about five minutes before, we had just heard Schuschnigg\u2019s last speech. And that was horrifying because he was always, he made a lot of speeches, all Austria must vote and must vote for independence. That\u2019s what he knew. And he was making another speech and all of a sudden you heard as if things were knocked about and you didn\u2019t know. I mean you listen to the radio and you heard knocking. And then you heard him say, people are just coming in and they are taking me away. This is the end of Austria. God bless Austria and Horst Wesselneed [ph], you know the German which goes today Germany, belongs to us. Tomorrow the whole world. So we knew the Nazis had, but what had happened was that the Nazi, German troops Hitler had already arranged for the German troops to cross the river, I mean Austria didn\u2019t have a (inaudible). So this was the end. And my father then rang. And Otto answered the phone. My father said I am just going to the station to catch the train to be home. And Otto said well you know it was interesting. Immediately you felt the Nazis would be listening to what you say. I mean they weren't that efficient to hacking, phone hacking, right. Murdoch now has been doing. But this was sort of mentality. So then Otto said don\u2019t come back and my father said but I must be with you. Listen to me. Don\u2019t come back. Finish. I can\u2019t tell you anymore. Listen to what your radio is saying. And my father was never in Austria after that which was very difficult for https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 29 November 17, 2011 me because to him, I remained his little girl that can\u2019t make, little girls don\u2019t make decisions. You know important what you should do, what you shouldn\u2019t. But before that after that, when Otto was in England, he wrote to me that he had a network of friends also Jewish. But they were all social democrats. It was that that bound them together, not their (inaudible). And one of them, he actually died in England, last year. He was a close friend of Otto\u2019s. And he was married already and he had, they were living in Italy. So he wrote to, Otto was trying to get Kurt out but he couldn\u2019t get him. Otto then flirted with one old lady who worked in the British home office who was in charge of giving visas. And he had a reason why he flirt, and he ultimately got a visa for Kurt. But he didn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t get it quick enough and he too knew that Kurt was really very frightened and it was hard there. So this friend said, because Austrians didn\u2019t need a visa for Italy but if you went by train you could cross the border. But not if you had a passport with a big red J. The Italians didn\u2019t want that. But ordinary Austrians, not Jewish could just go in. So he then, this friend from him, who settled in Italy, wrote to Otto and told him send your brother. He knew Kurt. And he actually stayed with them in Italy. They said send him by air, because the Italians had not yet realized that you can fly and that you can arrive in the country, the border people, the border police was trained. You see a passport with a red J, back, no you know but they flew. At the airports they hadn\u2019t trained police, trained people who spoke there."

Once you\u2019ve got the ticket tell me and he will get, arrange that he will be met on arrival. And that\u2019s what I did. And I was very cross then when I came back. Kurt then flew to Italy and second week in May and the Anschluss was in March. And he was very cross with me that I hadn\u2019t got him a flight the day after.

A little boy whose parents were Jewish in France. Whose parents gave him in to a convent through the nuns, say. And after the war, the parents perished but some relative were in Israel and they then went to find him. They had to fight because the nuns wanted to keep him. And this little boy obviously, I have here actually a very interesting thing. I go swimming to the Metropole which is a hotel here. Have a leisure center and they usually have fire alarms and usually they have training. So if you are in the pool, you go and just put the dressing on and you have to go upstairs to the reception. And then it goes all clear and that\u2019s all finished. But once at last a door. We were all from the pool standing, we were in the, all dressing room. And there was a young woman and I was sort of shaking my head showing that I was impatient. It wasn\u2019t, why do they keep us in here. But actually then the fire brigade came and there had https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 32 November 17, 2011 been an actual fire. And one person had lit an electric fire and that had caught something and so there had been a fire in the room. But there was this young woman who somehow, I don\u2019t know why it is when I find a fellow Jew. I somehow feel that they are fellow Jews. I don\u2019t know what it is. Do you know? You feel some sort of affinity and there was this young woman, looking very Jewish. Pale but quite hefty. So I said what do you think and so we began to talk and then they offered us all coffee and we sat having coffee. And she said where are you from. So I always say I am a Jewish refugee from Vienna cause you heard me say it. And she said you know my father is also from Vienna. Well her story, she is called Popper, P-O- P-P-E-R and she is a lovely young woman. So she also told her parents about my autobiography. Her paternal grandparents had a restaurant in the center of Vienna. It might have been one of the restaurants that Uncle Willie had taken us. But certainly were well off. So they bought immediately as the Anschluss occurred, a holiday ticket I think to Cyprus and off they went, before they introduced a red J on the passports. When you had money you could go. So they went there and then they went from Cyprus they went to Kenya. And in Kenya his parents put him into a monastery school and he converted to Catholicism. And he is, he looks like the stricher [ph] Jews. He has been, she brought them here. Her mother is a good England British, I think an Anglican but not a Jew. He is a devout Catholic and he brought up, she has a brother so two children. And both of them were forced to go to church on Sunday and confess and all the paraphernalia. And she is now claiming everywhere, she is second generation Jewish. And we had her you know Michele, the adopted daughter. And we always have a big Seder because there were other couples from Sussex University. Jewish, who also had children of the age as ours were. SO we every year it was at a different house. But then was my husband conducted the Seder. My husband had died so Michele said mommy don\u2019t because we were usually 30 or 40 people. So it was quite a lot for me. She said I (inaudible) it will be just our family and (inaudible) since then she has (inaudible). So this year too and so I said Michele can I bring this Popper. I asked her, would you. She said I\u2019d love to see her so she came and she is now, she wants to convert. She feels very ill at ease (\u2019?). So you know there are cases but he feels but here, I had him here when DT Rolner this poet from Israel was staying with me. Just coincidentally her parents came to see her so she said can I bring them along. I said yes, bring them along. And we\u2019ll see how your father feels about meeting an Israeli poet whose mother had been to Auschwitz and who was (inaudible). And I have never https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 33 November 17, 2011 seen him so ill at ease. I said well 1s this all new to you. And I sort of pretended I didn\u2019t know anything about anti-Semitism. Well I feel very sorry for her.

So the film director who I told you is a Bronx Jew and now is married to a Swedish woman, who made the film without getting any money out of it.

The first group of people. Because sociologically you know that none no individual can live as an individual, we all have to belong to a group of people. Feeling we belong. And in Vienna I thought I was a girl, Austrian girl. They didn\u2019t think of me like that. I was thrown out of school. And then I came to Yugoslavia. And of course I wasn\u2019t a Yugoslav citizen but my father and my mother then wanted to bring those gold pieces. I had a boyfriend as I (inaudible) and it was really when the, you know when our teacher at the last minute gave us our certificate at the school which was a catchment school for all the Jewish kids. And the teachers weren't trained teachers. They were real Nazis. They were SS. They turned up in SS uniforms. And his speech was when he distributed our last certificates. I think that\u2019s in my autobiography was I am sure that very few of you will manage to get out. But those few who will get out will die in the gutter. That he told to 14, 15 year old kids. So and I had this, I had you know we were, my mother never had enough money to give me a birthday party. But my school pals were all kids from Jewish parents. So I always got my mother to let me have some presents because I was invited but I could never (inaudible) around. So but in this school they made it a catchment school. The words and it was a high class, high Jewish class, the rich Jews had their children in this school. That school they made into a catchment school. So well some of them were kids that had been there and my boyfriend who wooed me, he sort of was the first one that I saw that way. And we were, and we were not allowed to be out. Jews were not allowed after work. So I would stay the night in his house. A nice (inaudible) for me this was. And he would sort of put his arm around me and he said well even in the gutter I will love you. So I then met him in London. By that time his father had a little money, put me. That\u2019s another thing. I don\u2019t know whether you read this. Why there was, I?ll come to Albania. In Albania, I was the only young girl. And there was a group and they joined you know about them. They https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 35 November 17, 2011 were wonderful.

And that\u2019s my most precious gold. So I came up with the idea we will have rolls, have rolls and in the rolls Pll put the gold pieces and we got them nine bolts of (satin?) at one end. But at the station in Maribor, my father and uncle where they waited for. And fortunately the border we were at one end of the train and the border control started at the other end. So Uncle Willie said come on out and we got out and we never went to the border control didn\u2019t see anything. But then the first night, I mean now that I\u2019m old I can understand.

And he then said well if you kiss me, I go with you to the train station when your father arrives. Well I did kiss him because that was very important for me. My father got out with this private detective and my father, you know I was his little girl and there he was. He said that\u2019s what your father has come to. He went on his knees in front of me.

And the private detective handed over our passports to the captain. So he fulfilled his commitment. But again we were, I mean the whole, friends of my aunt and uncle, everybody came to see us off. And there were so many boxes of chocolates and you know everybody felt very sorry for us. We were going, we were so (inaudible). And my mother said to Uncle Willie, tell us we can\u2019t take it. So I then said, look. And money we could take only the equivalent of 50 pounds. And this is what my father said to me. He said, he told me he said you know you are a young girl. You are really lovely but we arrive in a country that we don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know a soul there with 50 pounds. How long do you think we can survive? Can you think at all? So Ivan and you mustn\u2019t take any more. So I then remembered how I had taken the gold pieces out. So I did the same with the chocolates. I hid, took them you know big box of chocolate, a bag of chocolates and put at the bottom money. Also we had 100 pounds. We took the next of it. But then I was standing. My parents, they sat in one of the apartment, compartments of the train and I stood on the, in the passage with the detective who was traveling with us. And so we started chatting. And I then said opened the door and said to my mother, I would like to offer our friend here chocolate. She thought I must be crazy you know. He\u2019d discover something but I didn\u2019t \u2014 but the thing was, this was you know and this was another one who I feel saved my life. But my life inasmuch as my confidence that there are people who want to help because he asked me why. He didn\u2019t know why we, why he had to come with us. Why are we being thrown https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 39 November 17, 2011 out. So I told him and I told him about a few things that I'd seen in Vienna. And so he then said look, he said Pll marry you. He said now don\u2019t worry. You will not be in any problem and we will not have any problem and I will ask your parents and I said no, don\u2019t ask them. But he said if I marry you, it will be you and your parents will have automatically permits to stay. So there was a guy who worked for the police who was prepared to help us. And really he may have been in difficulties, likely to have been difficulties if he married, go in the next day and if we got married. So there was another one like Mr. Miderman who didn\u2019t really know what, why and what he was doing. So as you have heard me say to my granddaughter when she asked me what does swimming upstream mean. And I said it means that I had to fight all the way in my life. But every time somebody cropped up and helped and that\u2019s quite true. So and then we arrived by ship. Now that was another thing. On that ship was a German couple. Because they had bought the journey on that ship on the premise that they would just take them to Greece because that ship was going to Albania and further on and so on. And they couldn\u2019t get ashore to get to resort, to Greece. And they had a little baby and that little baby was, they couldn\u2019t pay so the captain didn\u2019t know what to do. He didn\u2019t have, and he kept them. They actually helped in the kitchen. And they cleaned the ship. Whatever became of them I don\u2019t know. But they were going up and back (inaudible). so this was (fortune?) . But then when we landed in Albania, the port, my father said well where do we go now. You are the decision maker, tell me. Where do you want us to go. And I didn\u2019t know, but then as I walked down the plank, I saw two men who were obviously Austrian refugees. From the clothing were there. And they recognized us and they welcomed us. And said one thing you may be sure. You\u2019ve come to a very friendly country. And they were. And I was then you know I was the only girl because all the other, there was one German couple. Her husband was a senior engineer, had been a senior engineer in a German factory. So she insisted when anybody wanted to talk to her, you had to say Frau Ober Engineer. We were all, had no money, nothing. All stated but we had to leave Frau Ober Engineer. And this and that\u2019s where I stole money and stole bread. And I was hungry. Because you know we had, it was a very orthodox church rule there. And I now saw the first Jewish wedding. There was a couple in their 30s from Germany who were married under German rule, but not under the Jewish religion. And they wanted to go to https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 40 November 17, 2011 what still is Palestine. And they had to have a Jewish wedding certificate. So we had a proper Jewish wedding. I mean it was fantastic to see the bride with the handkerchief ."

And there was a girl. And you see the richer Albanians sent their children into boarding school for education to Italy. So then they came back so there was a group of young Albanians who really didn\u2019t have to work. They didn\u2019t have to do anything to get money. And they really didn\u2019t know. They were bored stiff and when they saw me they came and they surrounded me and I didn\u2019t know Albanian. They talked Albanian and I didn\u2019t know Italian or any and, andI felt scared and they touched my shoulder and then I said in French, I could do colloquial in French.

So then they said well women don\u2019t go like you so I then said well I come from a different culture. And there was a famous actor, an Albanian called Moishe. They knew him, who was very famous. I knew of him. He played in drama performances in Vienna. And he was very good and had a big reputation. So they asked me did I know him and I said yes, I know of him. So I then, they wanted to know for them it was sort of Austrian in general, and Vienna in particular were sort of the center of sophistication and education.

And he had two younger sisters that were in boarding school. But the mother now, since the father has just died, doesn\u2019t want to send them back. Would I be prepared to teach them German, French and mathematics so that they would have some edu. So I said yes. I said well how old are they? Well I was then 16. Going on for 17 and they were 14 and 15. So that I wasn\u2019t much older than them. But I wasn\u2019t going to miss out on that. So he then took me to his home which was right opposite the sea, opposite the harbor. It was lovely and they had like the Muslims, the women live in purdah. You know there\u2019s women, there\u2019s a female section of the quarter, living quarters and the male one. And so obviously the girls were in the female one. And I fitted into this. So I remember I was really very cheeky. I did, I mean I knew French. I had done colloquial French, but I wasn\u2019t perfect, by any means. And there are many things that I didn\u2019t know the French for. Well I was teaching it. Well how do you teach a language to others when you have no language in common. If you and I know English and I want to teach you Albanian, well I can tell you the English words and learn like I said. But if, if we don\u2019t have a common language it is very difficult. So what I then did was to point this little chair and I would say the English, the French and the German word, if I knew the French. The German I would know. And they would write it down. And the next day I would say what is this? And I\u2019d expect them to know. Well sometimes they asked me for the French word and I had no idea. So you know what I did. I invented French words. But I said the words so quickly that they couldn\u2019t write them down. So the next day then I went back and I had a dictionary all right. I knew the word. Next day I would say well what is this, French, German. You know it in German, yes, you know it in French. Now we have. Well write it down now properly. Now I have been trying to find the heirs of this Dowana family. Because they were wonderful to me. The women of the house, their mothers and aunts and all the relatives that were there, they were all very nice to me. First of all they always served me with coffee, Turkish coffee and biscuits which was great really for me. And secondly, from their house, their house was a lovely big house right opposite the port. I sat there with looking out well obviously this is a chair. And https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 44 November 17, 2011 I would look out at the port. And I always loved the sea, and I told you. I told my mother I was born at the sea.

However many refugees turned up and lived because they had rented a house next to the police station. And they got, and the shop keeper that got the money from the Joint always had to get a piece of paper from the board of guardians. These were elderly Polish or Austrian Jews and to send it to the Joint that they would always continue sending. It was very, very little. I mean really as a growing girl I was starving. And I, and there was a larder which was always locked and once they had forgotten to lock it. And I saw it open and I sneaked in and I got a big piece of bread and I was delighted. But next day I was hauled before the board of guardians. That you don\u2019t do and my father burst into tears. You know his little girl. He couldn\u2019t supply enough food that. I mean it was natural, but I didn\u2019t feel terribly guilty. I was angry. There was bread. Why shouldn\u2019t I?"

You will never be able to come here. So you better come with mother and he said I promise you and mother, you talk with mother and tell her he will do anything just to get a visa. And he did.

I mean Mussolini was Hitler\u2019s role model. He really, he wasn\u2019t anti-Semitic at first, for a long time but in terms of his \u2014 you know that Mussolini invented the term fascisma [ph]. So you know he was the role model. So this counsel thought it would help him in his career to know German. And so I started teaching him. And I think you must remember this out of my autobiography. Then we were still there when Mussolini occupied Albania. And this counsel became the first governor of the coastal region. So the war, the Jewish \u2014 we thought that Mussolini would hand us refugees like a present over to Hitler. Because it seemed obvious. We were the only thing that Mussolini got out of Albania. That Hitler may want. So we were all terribly -- I mean they were just everybody. We were sitting in a cellar when the fighting was going on. And what was really moving was the next door policemen were worried because they told us. I mean you could see the big warships on the horizon. It was a port and Italy had big ships. The only ship that Albania had was the private yacht of King Zog. I mean that couldn\u2019t defend. And the policemen told us all they have to defend Durr\u00e9s against the Italian onslaught is three machine guns. And there, the roof of their police station was flat. And one of these three machine guns was standing there. They told us that. And they said well when the Italians will come ashore we will have to shoot. That\u2019s our job. And the Italians will want to knock out these three machine guns. And if they fail, if they miss, then they will kill you. And we don\u2019t want that. And we thought, we sat together. And we thought we would, Hitler would throw us out and treated us like nothing. And here were these little policemen worried about our life. It was really very moving. And I tell them that now too so they then said well tonight they told us, the onslaught was coming. They would come ashore. So first of all you have to find a house with a cellar because not many houses had cellars. Only the richest. And the richest had gone inland, the Albanian. But they left their servants to take care of their \u2014 but we you know we went in and we checked that they have a cellar. The servants wanted to stop us or they weren\u2019t too strong, strong enough to do that. So we found a house not too far from where our house was. But before this I must tell you, there were Salonika salesmen, Jewish salesmen selling goods. And well one of them was called Major. Very nice. He was 45 years old. For me he was like he had two feet in the grave because you know when you\u2019re 16, 17, 45 seems \u2014 but he fell in love with me. You must think everybody fell into, that was my life. And so he asked my father for give information so that he could marry me. At first he had asked me and I said I don\u2019t want to https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 47 November 17, 2011 marry anybody. And then he asked my father and my father said no, she was far too young. But he, then he also came to see -- but he had money. So he was always getting me presents and I didn\u2019t want them because I thought that make me dependent. And anyway when it comes then a little story and a little lie. So we stayed in the cellar during the onslaught and we heard the shooting. And they then said we, our guardians had a meeting. And said let\u2019s surrender. Let\u2019s not be sort of taken, but let\u2019s surrender. Let\u2019s say we know we are going to go to the next concentration camp, but let\u2019s do it with our heads up. Let\u2019s show them that we have courage. So ok. So they said well then the shooting stopped and so they said well now we will go and somebody who has, who can speak Italian must lead us. Well who could do that? I was the only one. In teaching German and French I picked up, I\u2019m not fluent but I picked up. So they gave me a stick and a white handkerchief for army and I should lead. So I led and I was trying to say in Italian, as best as I could. We are a group of German and Austrian Jewish refugees and I kept repeating this in my mind as we were walking along. And we must have been a really crazy lot, looking, you know these old men and women were shuffling along and wearing different kind of clothing. Anyway, and then came three Italians, one an officer with two guys from around the corner and saw us. And shouted halt. So I said stop. So we stopped. And then as I had expected, he came up to me and said who are you? And so and he did. So I then said in my, in the sentences I had rehearsed. I said we are a group of German and Austrian -- and he didn\u2019t let me go any further. I didn\u2019t get, have to say Jewish refugees. He put his arm around my shoulder and said Tedesk1, German. Italian, friends, amigo,. amigo. I didn\u2019t disillusion him. And so in a sense that was another saving. So then he put his two soldiers in charge of walking. He said where do you live? And I said over there. I didn\u2019t say that was the police station. And so he walked us back. But on the way back I thought well if they look through our rooms and if the police had wanted to hide their guns, then they might have put some into our rooms and if these Italian soldiers find them then the friendship will be off. But they didn\u2019t. They let us go. They looked through them but the soldiers said the police hadn\u2019t hidden anything. But then I heard somebody knock at the back, where we had the window looking out at the wasteland and there was a guy standing in Albanian uniform because they had a very small unit of soldiers. And he made me understand that he wants clothing. He wants to get https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 48 November 17, 2011 rid of his uniform. So I gave him one pajama of my father. And he stuck, changed there and this was my contribution to the freedom fight of Albania. But then the next day the, who was then the governor, the Italian ex Italian counsel, his car came to our residence and a uniformed driver, chauffeur had a letter And he had, the guardians went to the door. And it was addressed to me. So they were all excited. Says now we mean, we are being sent to the concentration camp. And I opened it and it said now I need you even more and he sent me a letter with so many stamps and he sent every day his car, was picking me up and there are so many guard posts on the way because they had just occupied Albania. I actually went last July when I made this film because King Zog\u2019s car was at the top of the hill and of course King Zog had fled. So this new governor of the city had moved into King Zog\u2019s castle. So we went, I got in touch with the grandson and I said well they want to film it. So they allowed us in because there weren\u2019t many people. So this is and then I have to -- and then my Greek boyfriend said, and he knew we had the -- among the young lot who were my sort of I was the pied piper and they followed me was a travel agent. Because I had gone, since we had the visas for England, I went to the French ambassador and said can I fly because Air France was the only airline that would fly from Albania to Paris, fuel, stop there for refuel and then go on to London. So that\u2019s the plane that I thought we were taking. But they told me I should go to the French ambassador to make sure and do you know they were bastards. We would have, my mother and I would have just stayed the 20 minutes that it would have taken them to refuel. But they did not. And they said we do not want refugees in our country. At a later date they may have had different stories. So then among this lot of young men, was one travel agent. So I asked him. I said well how can I get from here because I can\u2019t go by train. I have to go you know flying there. I can\u2019t fly. So how do I get there. So he then said there is one cargo ship that goes from Naples to Southampton and if you board that, there was one coming that would get you to Southampton on the 25\" of April. So that was all right. So and we paid him and the Joint sent money for our friend. I had one. But this Salonika guy said my dear I want to give you 500 pound. I want to do it. And I thought no, I\u2019m not being bought for 500 pounds and said no I don\u2019t. He then said well look don\u2019t be so silly. I'll give you the 500 and you take it. If you do not need them. If you don\u2019t have to use them I\u2019ll give you my, the details of my bank account in London and you pay the 500 pounds into that bank. And that is what I did. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 49 November 17, 2011 But I am sure because all the Salonika Jews went into Auschwitz and it was this, he was the general secretary of the you know, the Austrian . He was then the officer for the German army. And they occupied Salonika and ordered them all out. So I\u2019m sure that this, not only he had an account that I know because, but I can kill myself for not writing it down. Because I am sure there is a lot of Salonika money invested in the British and American banks. But no, I mean the heirs. This guy was not married. I don\u2019t know how many were married, how many had children. But the second generation wouldn\u2019t know the details . So why don\u2019t the American Jewish -- \u2019m trying here the Jewish community, why don\u2019t they sort of write to the \u2014 they said I should do it. Well I can\u2019t do it. But a Jewish community representative can say you know the Swiss banks. The American and Britain have really been very tough and gotten a lot of money out of it. But they themselves have never said we also have some money. And they must have it. Because you know the rich Jews in Europe and particularly a country like Greece, Salonika will have invested, will have bank accounts here. So the Swiss had to pay up. Why don\u2019t they, why don\u2019t the British. Or the American money. But no, nobody wants to take that on."

            "answer": "Yeah, it was on that day. But most of them were hidden during the war. For most of them you can see it. You want to see the rescue in Albania. Most of them were hidden. And there is actually one who married an American. She is called Joanna Newman with whom I am in touch. She said, I can\u2019t remember. She said that she arrived with her parents also from Yugoslavia. They were from Germany, but then they made it to Yugoslavia and from Yugoslavia they were thrown out and they came to Durr\u00e9s. But I had, I must admit I have no recollection. But that doesn\u2019t mean that, she was obviously there. And in that film you can see her in fact. She seems a very nice lady. And now I\u2019m on the Albania Mafia and so because there is a lady in New York who 1s called, she is a dentist, a doctor, Anna Cohen and she now also wants me to come and tell my story to her American Jewish lot and we are on very friendly terms but I have never met her. So I now know quite a lot of them. And they all, she you can see her on that film. She was born in Albania during the war and her mother was saved because they also -- what she has been doing for Albania is when there are youngsters who have been diagnosed with a disease for which they don\u2019t have any treatment in Albania. There are quite a lot of such individuals. That she will arrange, she will get the medical report. And if she knows, she will then establish whether if they are in New York they can get the treatment that will make them well again. She gets money, she\u2019s got money in her fund. She pays for them. They fly to New York. She arranges their treatment. Once they are well again, back they go. So also during the war. She also feels in a sense she was born there. And if the Albanians hadn\u2019t saved her mother, she wouldn\u2019t be there either."

            "answer": "So in Naples we stayed for the first, and while we were in Albania the men made the furniture out of orange boxes. My father made beds. We slept on hearths or in boxes or cupboards and but the Joint money helped us to stay in a hotel. Not a posh one but so I left my mother in the hotel. For her this was, she was still broken hearted, having had to leave my father. But she felt for the https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 51 November 17, 2011 first time she was sleeping in a bed. We were both there. And I said you stay here. I\u2019Il go and get our tickets for the cargo ship. So I had the voucher and I went to this address. I found it and I produced my voucher. And they said oh it\u2019s a pity. What date do you have to be in England? I said end of April. They said well this ship is two months delayed. You know I tell this story always to the kids and when I will say that. It\u2019s oh. When you feel you \u2014there\u2019s nothing. And I didn\u2019t know a soul. I mean how was I to know? And I knew my mother, if I tell her she wouldn\u2019t say really that\u2019s it. So I went outside and had a good cry for myself. And then I said well then I said I must let me Otto know what the problem is. Because I realized I mean if we can\u2019t get to England then he can\u2019t do anything but at least he would know what happened. But then I looked up and you know this Italian travel agency, cit, C-I-T is still was then still working. And it still, you can still see Cit Italian. So I looked up and there was Cit, so I said well maybe this is a sign. So I went in with our passports. And I said I need a flight to London from here. Can it? And he said no problem. He said have you got the money to pay. I mean I was a young one and I got out, I had money. Dollars so, it was safe. So he said no problem at all and so he rang Air France. And he said well the passports I wouldn\u2019t be (inaudible). No. We won\u2019t tell them. Well he rang other airlines, but of course the planes needed and couldn\u2019t fly such long distances. Everyone had to refuel on the way. So we had a tough time. But the only airline that would take us was KLM. But KLM was, we were boarding and we had to go by train from Naples to Milan. And in Milan at the airport we could get onto the KLM flight. And the KLM flight went, Cologne, Frankfurt, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, London. So I knew so that is when I wrote a letter. I mean in a sense like Horst Teers mother when she was on the train to Auschwitz, writing her last letter. I wrote a letter to Otto and I said we were on a flight, KLM. We are supposed to arrive in London but if we can\u2019t get through Germany, then you know where we to look. But that\u2019s all I could say and I gave him the time we were due. But then I said well how do I get it to him. So I went to talk to the KLM steward and that he is another one who had saved my life. Because really when you come and see you know taken every step, it was really true. Somebody turned up that helped. Because I said you know I said you know we are Jewish refugees. You can see our passport and I said do we have to get out when we dock at German ports. They said yes, the Germans don\u2019t allow anybody to remain on https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 52 November 17, 2011 the plane. So first stop was Cologne and I said to mother and as we landed we saw all those swastika flags and all those SS young men and SA brown u \u2014 I mean it was really, you know it brought back all we had seen in Vienna. We thought we got out. And my mother was terrified so I said listen. We\u2019ll walk straight and we will show we are not scared. So we all had to go through immigration so when I showed our passport, he said (German) you know what are the requirement, (inaudible) have to do. So I said no, we\u2019re not returning to your country. I said you can see we have an English visa and that\u2019s what our tickets say and that\u2019s where we are going. So he said ok and thankful. And we sat down but then when we got to Cologne, we all had to get out of there. And the airport was full of people from passengers from all over the world. And they announced over the loudspeaker Frau Und [ph] report. So I then thought well couldn\u2019t we disappear in this , how would they find, but then I realized with our passports because everybody had to fill out so then that\u2019s when the worst (inaudible) in my life. Because two Nazi bitches, really you can\u2019t use any other term. They were in the female SA, SS uniforms, black skirts black, jackets, swastika and they took us into a small room and then said now strip. Strip? I felt you know I couldn\u2019t say, but what they were after was what we were smuggling. They went through every seam in our you know skirts and I mean I can\u2019t describe and then they were beating us and my mother collapsed and I had to pick her up and they would then say stop helping this cow of a Jew. And I mean it just, I don\u2019t want to remember that. But then fortunately I had this letter. I had forgotten that I had it in one of the pockets in my jacket. The letter from this, what used to be the Italian cultural and it was in the government, with all these stamps and the letter said that you know Miss senorina, senorina Trude, it was all in Italian is a friend of the governor of the coastal area of Albania and should be allowed to pass because that was for their know. And when they saw this one of them said, what\u2019s this. And I said, I then so again I must say when I think my daughters or my granddaughters wouldn\u2019t have but they hadn\u2019t been through everything that I had. I said that\u2019s the only thing that we\u2019ll say. So I said don\u2019t you understand Italian. And they said no. I said well then you\u2019re very stupid and I got a big beating but then she said well what does it say? So I then said but I read out something which wasn\u2019t there at all. I said and I know the governor. I know that they are on the flight to London and that senorina Trude Grunewald will let me know when she arrives. And if I don\u2019t\u2019 hear I will check up on her. I made that up on the spur of the moment. And she said you\u2019re lying and I said is there nobody. I said everybody like you who doesn\u2019t understand. Tell him tell me. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 53 November 17, 2011 it should be in Italian. Italy is your friend. So what are you talking? I got a lot of bashing, but I don\u2019t \u2014 so one of them said to the other, look after these two Jews. And she went out and she came back and she obviously had found somebody who had read this and understood that it was the Governor of Italian governor of the coastline of Albania. So she said get dressed and so we were bleeding and we were not in a fit state. And my mother certainly wasn\u2019t so when I helped her to dress, they stopped me from helping her and it was terrible. And then we were dressed and they said now you can go back on your plane. So I said our passports because they had them on the (inaudible). They said you have no right. You can call yourself very lucky that we let you go so don\u2019t ask for anything. If I were you two. So we sort of go, went very slowly and trying to get back to the plane and the steward that I had given the letter was standing, of course there were steps up to the door. And he was standing at the door, sort of waving, being very happy to see us. But then I sort of shook my head so he came down the steps and said what\u2019s up. So and I said yes, we can go back to our plane but we don\u2019t have passports and if we don\u2019t have passports I know we will never get in for England. So he said leave it to me and he went and he retrieved our -- so you know I felt like kissing him. But foolishly I never tried to get his name. To say thank you because if he hadn\u2019t got our passports we wouldn\u2019t be here now. So there are so many people who all the way have done a good job and have really been helpful."

            "answer": "They reported, the Red Cross in autumn that Hit, that the Nazis had tried people killing with, by gas on people who were in lunatic asylums, right. That\u2019s when they experimented. When they saw it work, they fairly well you can. You see the thing was which newspapers then reported here that a lot of the German army had nervous breakdowns because they made the young children, women undress, dig a hole and then they shot them into it. This is what they had to do. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 55 November 17, 2011 Well you know you had to have a very strong c, you know conviction that this is what you need to do and what you should do. But normal people, I mean they weren\u2019t enough resisting but it made them have nervous breakdowns. And it was that, that got the notice then to apply this to not shoot, that these soldiers don\u2019t have to shoot. By gas you just put them in and say you go and have a shower and they come out as bodies."

            "answer": "But finally I must tell you that this Dowana family where I was teaching, these two young girls. Now this young man that was their brother and who arranged this teaching, while during the Communist period in Albania he was obviously a very rich man and they actually I can show you this. If you\u2019ve seen my diary, I\u2019ve got a certificate from the Dowana family which 1s dated, I can show you that, November or December 1940. Saying how much they enjoyed and appreciated that I taught these two sisters, these two young girls and that they are very sorry that I had to leave. So I\u2019ve since then wanted for this film, as you heard me say, you know I\u2019m a Jewish refugee. Do you know about anything? And I couldn\u2019t find \u2014 when I was making this film in Albania, one of the \u2014 I thought well one of, they must also be in their 80s but they would have been married and they would have children. So I thought there must be some heir that will remember so I went around the dock and do you remember the Dowana. No, no, no. so and you heard then, then Rick says well because it\u2019s 72 years since. But now this young Dowana was then got married. The brother of those two girls I taught. And they had children who then, but then when the communists came in, he was put into jail and he then died. But there is now a grand, his granddaughter, a young Dowana, they went to America to Florida. And she is now an American citizen. And I\u2019ve now found her. I\u2019ve been looking for her and through the Albanian embassy, where there is one young woman whose parents live in Durr\u00e9s and they are so keen on helping me find my outcome. So she wrote to her parents and she found that this young woman, she\u2019s lovely. She now works for the American embassy in Tirana. But she now has a lot of property because after the communists went out, now they, everybody who had property can reclaim them. So the house in which I was sitting and watching the port, the developers got it and so she got some money from that. But they knocked it down and put a -- I don\u2019t know about seven or eight floors apartment building where there are shops. And she said you must come and stay with me. I have three such (boards?) and she is just, I mean she drove me everywhere and she calls me Grandma and I mean I can have everything. She gave me when I left, you know in Albania they make specially strong brandy. It\u2019s called Draki. She gave me a large, bottle. Would you like a little brandy."
