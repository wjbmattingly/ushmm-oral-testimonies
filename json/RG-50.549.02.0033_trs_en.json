Okay, maybe we could just start by having you say your name and where we are, maybe what the date is, what the weather\u2019s like outside.",
            "answer": "Well, today is the 13\" of January, in 1999, and we are here sitting in my kitchen, in Highland Park, Illinois and the weather is awful. It\u2019s snowing, and snow 1s piled up very, very high, and it\u2019s wonderful to be inside and not have to suffer outside in the cold. And we are sitting here talking about what happened to my life after we were liberated, and I\u2019m ready to ask -- answer questions, I think."

            "question": "-- with the museum in Washington. But let\u2019s go back a bit and you\u2019ve talked about this somewhat in that interview. Let\u2019s take it back maybe to a couple months before the 33 3 end of the war. If you could just briefly describe what -- what your circumstances were, where you were, who you were with, and what was happening at that time.",
            "answer": "Well, we were liberated in, I think the third of December, of 1944, by the Scottish army and they were followed by I guess British and the Americans. But I don\u2019t know much about that any more. The -- Couple of months before that, we suffered immensely under real war conditions. In September they started dropping the troops in Arnum, and since I lived in Fenlow at that time, which isn\u2019t so far, we saw, actually it -- all the troops coming over in big airplanes, and it was on a Sunday, it was brilliant, sunny day, and [ll never forget it, because it was just immense. It -- It was never ending, big airplanes and little airplanes, which we later on found out were gliders, and that\u2019s really when our liberation sort of started, from that moment on, we were practically constantly under fire. And we -- we couldn\u2019t go outside any more and we didn\u2019t have gas and electricity and things like that. And life became very, very difficult. I was still in hiding of course, and a few very dangerous things happened to my personally. We had no food so my stepmother and her daughter went out to get food in the field, like cauliflowers an-and potatoes and things like that, cause the farmers couldn\u2019t get it, because the man didn\u2019t go outside, they- the Germans were very much aware of the man and they wanted them to go to help them in Germany, I guess. So, and then, it was a couple of -- maybe -- it was in October, maybe then already, that some Germans came to the house. I was there with my stepfather, who was in bed, because he was on strike. The Dutch government had told all the people who worked for the railroad that they had to go on strike, so he did. And there 33 4 was a son in the house, who was supposed to be working for the Germans. So, he was also somewhere hiding in the house, so I had to open the door. And the Germans said they wanted to look in the house, and they looked in the house, and they decided the house was good. And they told me they were going to come back in the evening to live in our house for awhile. So, for about two weeks, I think, they lived with us. And they sometimes asked for me, but I was every night very, very tired, so when they came in, my stepmother told them that well, I was so tired, I wasn\u2019t used to doing the housework and all that sort of stuff, so I always went to bed early. So they never saw me. Course, they were scared that if they found out I was Jewish, that the whole family would be killed. So, when the war came closer and closer, the Germans left, because they -- they stayed away from the real fighting apparently. And then in December, we were finally liberated, but that was sort of difficult too, because the -- the Germans had recreated all the people who lived in our little town, and they had to all go across the River Maus, into Germany, and then up north, into the northern part of Holland. And they wanted all the regular people out of town, and they wanted to go -- go [indecipherable] us for the Americans and the British who were coming. So, my stepparents decided that I, who had no papers at all, was too much of a danger to take along on that kind of a trip, and so we all went into hiding. The man stayed somewhere, I don\u2019t know where, but we, the women, stayed in a bombed-out house, and there we stayed for a couple of days. There was some food, there was water and that\u2019s where we were liberated. And it was, of course, still very, very dangerous, because the troops didn\u2019t cross the river, and it was constant bombarding and 33 5 grenade fire. So, we somehow crawled to our house, and then the British decided that they didn\u2019t want us there, so we were evacuated to another town, and there we stayed til I think the middle of April. In the meantime, Holland wasn\u2019t even liberated altogether, so while I was in the other town with my step-parents, and the son and the daughter, we were free. My step-parents kept on asking me, very unnoticed for me, really, my name and my -- my father\u2019s name. And then the next day they ask me my mother\u2019s name, and so they came -- in a couple of weeks they came to know who I really was, cause you never talked about it and you never wrote that down. And they apparently gave that to a Jewish organization who was trying to find all the children. And then they -- that organization decided that maybe it was a good thing for me to go to Israel, but -- then Palestine, but I didn\u2019t want to hear about that, cause I wanted to know if I still somehow, would find my parents back. I had no idea where they were. So, they -- they decided they were going to keep me in the house for -- I don\u2019t know how long, maybe they would have taken me forever. And then my father, who was hidden in Amsterdam first, but later on left for northern Holland, somehow got himself involved in underground work. He was an artist and he was good in doing precise pictures, so he put part of the province where he was in, an-and mapped it for the underground and that was sent to England, so that when the troops were coming, that they knew exactly where every house was, and where every little obstacle would be. And then somehow he was caught by the Germans. They came in the house to check something. He and the owner of the house were sent to prison because they were listening to the English radio when the Germans walked in. And thank 33 6 God my father didn\u2019t reveal that he was Jewish, and they never found out that he was Jewish, so he spent a couple of months in jail. And had they known he was Jewish, they would, of course, have killed him instantly. But he was liberated there. And as it was, the troops apparently traveled with lists of children who were liberated. So, when my father came out of prison, they somehow presented him with a list. And my maiden name is D\u2019 Ancona, D\u2019A, and when -- in Holland, it\u2019s -- the A counts as the main letter, so my name was on top, and my father found out that I was okay. But then the problem was he was up north and I was down south and there was no transportation in Holland, especially in the part where I was, everything was damaged and bombed, and there were no roads, there was no public transportation, no trains, no buses, nothing. So, since my father had worked for the underground, he got some letters from important people, I would say, who gave him permission to travel. So he somehow talked himself into being allowed to cross the rivers, and you know, on a bicycle without tires. And he came one day to -- to the house where I was hidden, and I then lived in freedom. And well, he knocked on the door, and we didn\u2019t get many visitors there, and so when I heard a man speak, I knew right away it was my dad. And at that time I found out that my mother was caught by the Germans and that she had gone away, that she was in the holding camp, Westerbork, and after that was sent to wherever, and that we had no way of knowing if my mother had survived."

            "question": "You say an organization, do you know the name of it, or who those people were?",
            "answer": "Ah, well they called them Emfay, which is in Dutch, the same as LTD. And the -- the organization was started by a man, Mr. Debrown, which was not his real name, and he had helpers, young man and young women, who took the kids from the Germans. When - When you were picked up from your home in Amsterdam, small children were put in a - sort of what -- what used to be a school, and the parents were across the street in what used to be a theater. And then, before they went on transport to Westerbork, and those children, those young children were taken care of by Jewish people, most likely, I think, nurses, and people who took care of kids. And they went out for walks sometimes. And the organization had made it their business to steal some of those children. So, every day when some of those kids were walked outside to get a little fresh air, -- and I\u2019m sure that it was prearranged with help inside, that certain children were going to be taken away. So 33 8 they had as many clothes on as possible. And then they walked at the end of the line, cause there were like maybe 10 or 15 kids, and then at the end, and then those young people came and just stole them away. And how they organized getting rid of their papers and -- I have no idea. I guess that\u2019s known in -- in Holland how it went, but those children were just rescued. And I was still at home. I was one of the very, very last in Amsterdam, who lived in their own house and that was because we are Sephardic. My father and my mother both are from Sephardic descent, and the Germans, with all their crazy rules and regulations had, at some point said that most of the Sephardine were going to be descendants from Aranos, which most likely was true, and we were not really Jews, we were Christians. So, my parents tried everything in the world to get us declared non-Jews, not because they didn\u2019t want to be Jews, but you know, it was important not to have to go to the other side of the world. I don\u2019t know what -- what my parents knew about what was waiting on the other side of the fence. I didn\u2019t know an awful lot, because as much as possible was kept away from me. But I knew, and everybody knew that, that it wasn\u2019t very good. So, we were in Holland; in Amsterdam still quote quote free, in October of 1990 -- in 1943 were -- and was practically no Jew left in Amsterdam walking the streets. There was no school any more, and there was no organiz -- organized life for Jews any more. So, on the 16\" of October, my father decided that since we weren\u2019t declared non-Jews, we had to go. So, my father found this organization and they said they would have a place for me. So, on mon -- and one morning they came -- and the lady came to pick me up and she took me along to the station and there she handed me to a 33 9 young man, and he took me on the train with another child that I never saw again, and we traveled a long distance. We had to change the pla -- the train in the station and we took another train. Then we finally came at the destined place and this young man said to me, \u201cWell, you just wait here.\u201d And he took the young man with him and came back maybe three quarters of an hour later, half an hour later, without the young man, but that a -- that time that I had to wait at that station was like -- like a year. It was never ending, and here I was, I was in -- I mean, I was 13 years old. I was -- I was child, but I was -- I was aware of the dangers. I had no name, I didn\u2019t know where I lived, I -- I -- I -- I was nobody, and if they -- somebody had come up to me and said, \u201cWhere are you going, what are you doing, are you waiting for somebody?\u201d I couldn\u2019t say anything. So, I was very, very scared. And then when he came back, he came on back with a -- with a bicycle, so I went with him on the bicycle and he dropped me off at this family. And there I stayed for the rest of the year and -- and another year. And I was very, very different from my own home. I came from a middle class family, nothing very fancy, but these people, the man was working for the railroad, he repaired railroad cars. And they were fine people, there\u2019s nothing to s -- be said about them, they were risking their life for me, they knew what they were doing. And they were terrific. But 1t was an altogether different life than what I was used to. They were going to church all the time, they read the Bible, they prayed every day and I wasn\u2019t used to that at all, cause my parents were atheist, and -- not that they wanted to deny they were Jewish, but there was absolutely no religion in my house, and so -- 33 10"

You never knew what the Germans were going to do. But, no, they knew very well what they did, and after the war, I asked them why did you do this? And then my stepmother told me that somebody who was sent by one of the clergy in that town, came to their house and asked if they would take a child, a Jewish child. And she was willing to say yes right away, but she thought it was prudent to ask her husband if he was thinking the same way. So, she said, \u201cWell, you have to wait til my husband comes home from work and I can tell you tonight.\u201d So, as it happened, their oldest daughter was going to leave home, and that is very important because in those days, you couldn\u2019t buy beds, you couldn\u2019t buy linens, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 33 11 you couldn\u2019t buy blankets, you couldn\u2019t buy anything, even if you had the money, it wasn\u2019t available, and so they could only take me if they had a spare bed. So when the daughter left, I could take her place, so they told the man who came from the underground, they could only have a girl, because I could stay with their other daughter in the same room. So that\u2019s how come I found this place, or they found the place for me."

            "answer": "It\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- It\u2019s an awful situation to be in cause, number one, I was very nervous that I had left my parents, and that this -- this -- this whole town was -- was -- you know, it was so different from a big city, and everything in tha-that household was different than -- than in my house, and I -- I was -- I\u2019m an only child, so I wasn\u2019t used to brothers and sisters, and once I was settled a little bit, you know, they started to tease me and I wasn\u2019t used to that at all. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve cried a lot, because ed -- I knew -- I was old enough to realize that crying wasn\u2019t going to help. And I knew also that I had to behave myself and that I couldn\u2019t be this spoiled brat and that I had to adjust, because if I didn\u2019t do that, maybe the people wouldn\u2019t want to keep me, and where was I going to go then? I had nowhere to go. And that is the -- an -- an awful feeling. If -- If they had put Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 33 12 me out on the street, I wouldn\u2019t have had any place to go. I was far, far, far away from even non-Jewish friends that I knew, but I had no money, I had no papers, I had -- I had nothing. And I think that was the scariest part, that I had to really be as perfect as could be, because I couldn\u2019t risk any problems in that house, so when they teased me I had to take it and they didn\u2019t do that to be mean to me, but they were just used to it and I was not. I couldn\u2019t go to school. The daughter went to a parochial school, but that was a long walk and there was no transportation at that time any more either. So, they didn\u2019t want me to risk that big long walk to school. So I had to stay home and in the beginning I tried to do a little bit of my schoolwork, but my head wasn\u2019t there. So, my stepmother said, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t get you in here to be my maid, but maybe it would be a good idea to help me once in awhile.\u201d So I -- I helped my stepmother with making the beds, and in those days, everything was breaking, so we had to sew a lot and mend a lot and I\u2019m pretty handy when it comes to that, so I helped and I liked that. And I loved to scrub, so I -- I learned a lot. I learned a lot of things that my mother never would have taught me, and that came in handy later, I think. So, I -- I had to do things during the day, cause I was bored stiff otherwise. And so my stepmother and I got along very well. When she went shopping, she sho -- most of the time took me along, cause she wouldn\u2019t let me home alone, and so we went shopping and -- but there wasn\u2019t much to shop, so we didn\u2019t do that too much. And so that was the -- my daily job, to help and do as much as I could to -- to not be a nuisance."

            "question": "Well, that\u2019s an astounding experience. What -- What was that like?",
            "answer": "Unreal, unreal. We -- We -- We didn\u2019t know where my mother had gone. We knew my mother was caught at the place where she was in hiding, and after jail and I don\u2019t know what else, she ended up in -- in Westerbork, in that camp before you go to -- to Germany or Poland. And since we had had this stamp in our papers, that we were most 33 16 likely not Jewish, and merranos and all that sort of stuff, which was like an exemption, my mother had had that in her papers and the Germans didn\u2019t first want to recognize that, but when she was in that camp, with the help of friends who lived there for quite awhile, they recognized that. So, my mother was sent to Theresienstadt, and that was sort of the show camp for the Germans. And that -- My father knew that she had been sent to Theresienstadt. But we also knew, after the war, that not everybody stayed in Theresienstadt, and so for the rest, we had no knowledge of what had happened to my mother. My -- My mother came back, though, she told us what had happened, and she did the rounds. She stayed in -- She was caught in July of \u201944, which most likely is why she was still alive, because it was sort of at the end of the war. She -- She went from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz, and there she stayed for about two weeks. And she didn\u2019t talk much about that, but when she did talk about it, she said it was hell, and it was worse than hell. They sort of stayed together, 10 Dutch women, and what was the best thing in Auschwitz was that if there was a transport to go somewhere else, cause nothing could be worse than Auschwitz. So, one evening, all the people who knew about that there was a transport going, were lining up outside somewhere. And another story goes that everybody who is up front ends up going on transport, and the ones who are left over are going to be killed, that they knew. However, the Germans liked doing nasty things, so when all those women are fighting and -- and -- and -- and being excited about going away from Auschwitz, were standing 1n line, they let them turn around, so the ones who were standing in front were standing 1n the back and the ones who standing in back were 33 17 standing up front. That saved my mother\u2019s life, because my mother otherwise would have been in the back, instead of in the front. Then she was transported to Lanzing, which was- I guess nobody knows about that concentration camp. It was part of Mauthausen, in Austria. And there she had to work in a factory where they made rayon for parachutes. Very poisonous. People who work in that kind of an industry have to get extra food, have to drink a lot of milk, can\u2019t do it more than so many months, I guess, in a year, and there are strict rules, but for Jewish women that wasn\u2019t important, so they didn\u2019t get fed, and they had to work very hard. They burned their skin and they were nauseous and sick sometimes, because all the poisonous gases and whatever. They -- My mother was fluent in German, and that sort of helped them, too, I think. My mother was -- I don\u2019t know ab - if she was -- ca -- you can say she was a boss, but she was a teacher and so she knew how to be ahead of the group, and so she told the Germans off whenever she could. And they sabotaged a lot, too, cause if you put your finger on those instruments, then the whole thing messed up, and they ruined I don\u2019t know how much. And so they were good at that. And somehow my mother survived, even though she got very, very ill there. They operated on her without any anesthesia, any -- any medicine, nothing. And even though the German doctor who did it wanted to kill her, I\u2019m sure, he saved her life, because if he hadn\u2019t done that, I\u2019m sure she would have died. So, by the time she was liberated, she was very, very ill, but the Americans took enormous good care of them. They sent them to hospitals, they had them x-rayed. Everybody who had TB was sent to a sanitoritum, and the -- the medical staff of, I guess the military, took care of the prisoners. They stumbled 33 18 on this group of women. Now, my mother was with those 10 -- of which one had passed away, but there were also lots of Hungarian women in that group, and I don\u2019t know where those americ -- the -- where those Americans really took them. My mother talked about flying to, I think southern Germany, and from there they were transported through Switzerland, to France, and there they stayed for awhile, and then they came to Holland. But you have a -- imagine that there was absolutely no normal transportation. Railroads were bombed, and so it was very hard to get a train together and th-there wa -- there was no infrastructure whatsoever, so there was no mail. My mother wrote every day and we never got those letters, until months and months later, after she had arrived. And then when we all three were back in Amsterdam, we didn\u2019t really know what to do. Our business was dismantled, all our belongings were taken away. And somehow my father started again. He -- He got some help, I think, from the Marshall fund. That -- That wasn\u2019t something that they gave you, ee -- it was like loans. And in the same house where we used to live, we came back.

About the Dutch, I don\u2019t think I feel as strongly a-about the Dutch, as about the Germans, but I know now that the Dutch, as a whole, could have done a lot more, including our queen. Queen Wilhemina never talked about anything, not on the -- on the English radio, about stand up against the Germans, try to help your Jewish neighbors. Never, ever that that came about, and they turned to her, then they thought, \u201cWell, it\u2019s too dangerous to help the Jews.\u201d I mean, I was too young to realize all those things maybe then, but when you think about it, when you\u2019re a grown-up and an adult, you wonder why not more people had tried to help. On the other hand, I know that it was extremely dangerous, because Jewish doctors only could t-take care of Jewish patients and non -Jewish doctors couldn\u2019t take care of non- Jewish -- of Jewish patients. Everything was segregated and we had never had that in Holland. Holland was a very liberal country. As a matter of fact, my ancestors came to Holland after the Inquisition, and Holland welcomed them. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- It -- It\u2019s very hard to -- to really judge and to say, well they could have saved more, because everybody knew that if they did help Jews, they would be punished like Jews. On the other hand, if 33 23 lots of people would have stuck together, maybe they would have been able to accomplish more. In Belgium they did a lot more for the Jews than they did in Holland. And it\u2019s -- it -- it -- it sh -- true it wasn\u2019t publicized, I mean, so most of the Jews lived in the big cities, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, maybe The Hague, and in some s -- all over the country. And the -- the population in -- in the smaller towns, might not have known exactly what happened to the Jews, but the masses in -- in the big cities, did know. They saw it. | mean, part of Amsterdam was cordoned off and nobody could move, and they went house to house and house, an-and picked up the Jews. And 1-it was -- it was a very difficult thing. I can\u2019t blame them hundred percent because I know how dangerous it was to help Jews. On the other hand, you would have liked to had a little more help from the masses. And they did it once when they had the strike, when the first Jewish young people were picked up, they had a strike in Amsterdam, all the municipal workers stopped working and it was a mass demonstration that day, and there was is a monument, [indecipherable] dock worker in Amsterdam, to remind us of that. And that was fantastic, but it was one day, and then they went back to work, and the Germans went back to pick up Jews. So, it\u2019s -- I can\u2019t say that I -- I -- I hated the Dutch people for it, but in hindsight, you could say they could have done a little more for us."

Our lives were tough because we had -- we had to work so hard to get back to -- to where we were before. And I think about it, I have the greatest admiration for my father, who somehow managed to get a factory back to work, and make some money. And, I mean, we had a house again and later on, we had -- with everything we needed again. It\u2019s amazing how it -- it all came back. And what was very painful after the war was that some people left money and -- and belongings and there were big fights in families on who got what, and nobody had a will, cause you didn\u2019t think of things like that. So you inherited from the strangest people and from your closest relatives, you sometimes didn\u2019t inherit.

And so that was a hard thing, because most of the people in my age group, in Holland, were gone. Were very few eligible men. So, it took me awhile to -- to find the right one, or the right one to find me. And so, since his mother is observant, I decided that it was prudent to start out with a kosher home. And then we, somehow, when the kids grew up, we got more observant, and my husband 1s very observant, I am a little less observant. But we keep a kosher home, and we keep all the holidays. And the kids are not 33 35 that observant. We tried to teach them, and it\u2019s up to them now. They went to parochial school, here in Chicago.

But it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s hard to be very religious when I know some people all together forgot about religion after the war, others went just to religion to get strength in life.
