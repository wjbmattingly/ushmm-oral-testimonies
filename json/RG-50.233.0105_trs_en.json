We lived in this little town called Humfenheim, essentially an agricultural town. In those days some farmers st ill lived upstairs and the cows lived downstairs. I mean that\u2122s how close they were. And, the regional town called Sinsheim is about four kilometers from there. And for some reason or another, my brother and I were walking to Sinsheim I don\u2122t remember why, and one of the pl easures along that road was that the road was lined on both sides with apple trees. It must have been the time when the apples were just about ripened, but they weren\u2122t ripe yet. And to this day I love green apples. We ate a lot of green apples as we walked along that national road, a two-lane road. A nd we\u2122d take a bite out of the apple and we would throw the rest of the appl e at whatever car was speeding by. We would miss most of them but this particular car, we hit right smack on the door and the whole apple splattered. The car came to a grinding halt, back ed up, and it turns out that the apple had hit the SS sign of this particular car which was on the road. And the SS guy comes out of the car. \ufb01Who threw the apple?\u2122 And we both denied it, and of course he knew we were lying. He took our name and didn\u2122t say anything more. That night we came home and our father says, \ufb01I had a call\u2013 I was visited by the police. What did you guys do? You were throwing apples.\ufb02 \ufb01We weren\u2122t throwing apples.\ufb02 And he hi t us across the face, I can still\u2013"

And pushing it, you know, to my uncle\u2122s house where they had made room for us to live with them. They did not, as I remember, they didn\u2122t burn that synagog ue. They literally took axes and hammers and kind of destroyed it bit by bit without setting it on fire. When I was in Germany about a year and a half ago, for the second time, the local mini ster walked me around the village. This is a whole separate subject. And he took me to the place where the synagogue was, which I had a little trouble remembering and, well, there it was. They had mana ged to put a little plaque up which said \ufb01former synagogue\ufb02. They had, of cour se appropriated eventually the real estate, and a pharmacy had been built on that lot. So ther e\u2122s no evidence. That\u2122s really all I remember except my father being arrested, sent to Dach au and came back, I believe about four weeks later. It was snowing. This was November so this would make sense. December, January or something like that. He was limping very badl y, had a red bandage, a red kerchief-like tied around foot, you know, ambling into the house. I reme mber that particular scene. That\u2122s about all I can remember."

On the assumption you could hide your identity. You know, if you didn\u2122t regi ster for labor in Germany and so on you were subject to arrest even if you were French. Well that\u2122s how we somehow got through the war. We somehow heard about D-Day. And eventually we all ended up back in Montsac in this home. The home now took over a building, a relatively new building that the Vichy government had built for physical education b ecause they were going to develop their own master race. So we ended up in this rather pos h building which today, incidentally is a hotel which I slept in when I was back there in 1972. It was a time-warp experience of it\u2122s own. And \u2013"
