So we lived there until the Kristallnacht when, of course, the synagogue was destroyed and we had to move out of the apartment very quickly. We moved in with an uncle who lived in that same town."

No, it was two years. Till they prohibited Jewish kids from going to the public schools. And I was then enrolled in a Jewish operated school in Heidelberg. And every morning I had to get up about six and take a train all by myself to go to Heidelberg and in the evening I returned home. I did this for one or two years, well until the Kristallnacht, and then I think that school closed. One or two years, yeah."

I was asked to leave the room when they talked about Nazi indoctrination, which of course made us little Jewish boys stick out like a sore thumb.

Recently, I returned to Germany. This is an aside. And the seminary student, who 1s 28 years old wrote a thesis on the life of the Jewish community in this town. And he found a lot of details about the history of the community, and myself and my family, and so on. Things that I didn\u2019t know, I had forgotten. And, in fact, he found my school records.

And I think as long as he had to put up with me he did, and when I was prohibited from attending, I guess --- I really don\u2019t know. But I was surprised to find my grades after about 50 years, you know. Wasn\u2019t particularly paramount on my mind."

            "answer": "Yeah. I don\u2019t remember really playing with any particular kids. When you ask that question, the image comes to mind of the first funeral I went to. One of the non-Jewish kids died of something and the whole class, I was still in the public school, went to the funeral. The first time I\u2019ve ever been in the cemetery. And I vividly remember the open grave and the casket in it and every kid was supposed to go by and drop a flower on top of this casket. And I was so scared, I just couldn\u2019t do it. That\u2019s all I remember. Now whether this kid was a particular friend of mine, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have any vivid memory of ever really playing, or really having a good time to tell you the truth. I, or perhaps I and my brother, but my brother was so much younger, were always too busy fleeing from being attacked. I remember the streets were  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

These were not paved roads, they were dirt roads with rock over them. And I always had bloody knees because I always kept stumbling and falling as the kids would pursue me or they would throw rocks. They were very handy little missiles, you know, pick them off the floor and start throwing. So my memories were not particularly happy ones in that town."

I think that some of the older people in town, in the time of higher excitement, particularly after, maybe Hitler made a speech, and we would venture out in the street, in those days they still had horses and wagons, you know. I remember vividly one particular man who lived close by coming down that street on a wagon and taking his, what do you call this thing that you hit horses with?"

And they would buy me a ticket, a monthly commuter ticket, just like the Long Island Railroad. And every morning, I would end up on that train with a school bag on my back and a big thermos bottle in the school bag with the books, that was my lunch."

We lived in this little town called Humfenheim, essentially an agricultural town. In those days some farmers still lived upstairs and the cows lived downstairs. I mean that\u2019s how close they were. And, the regional town called Sinsheim is about four kilometers from there. And for some reason or another, my brother and I were walking to Sinsheim I don\u2019t remember why, and one of the pleasures along that road was that the road was lined on both sides with apple trees. It must have been the time when the apples were just about ripened, but they weren\u2019t ripe yet. And to this day I love green apples. We ate a lot of green apples as we walked along that national road, a two-lane road. And we\u2019d take a bite out of the apple and we would throw the rest of the apple at whatever car was speeding by. We would miss most of them but this particular car, we hit right smack on the door and the whole apple splattered. The car came to a grinding halt, backed up, and it turns out that the apple had hit the SS sign of this particular car which was on the road. And the SS guy comes out of the car. \u201cWho threw the apple?\u2019 And we both denied it, and of course he knew we were lying. He took our name and didn\u2019t say anything more. That night we came home and our father says, \u201cI had a call... I was visited by the police. What did you guys do? You were throwing apples.\u201d \u201cWe weren\u2019t throwing apples.\u201d And he hit us across the face, I can still..."

They literally took axes and hammers and kind of destroyed it bit by bit without setting it on fire. When I was in Germany about a year and a half ago, for the second time, the local minister walked me around the village. This is a whole separate subject. And he took me to the place where the synagogue was, which I had a little trouble remembering and, well, there it was. They had managed to put a little plaque up which said \u201cformer synagogue\u201d. They had, of course appropriated eventually the real estate, and a pharmacy had been built on that lot.

Someone who was laying near me, perhaps not next to me, passed away during the night and my mother rushed me out of the room, the barracks, as quickly as she could. This was October/November, and as you know was rather miserable weather. Very muddy, very rainy, rather cold. I don\u2019t remember the barracks being heated, but they might have been. It was a rather, you know, difficult situation.
