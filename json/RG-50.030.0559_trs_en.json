Mr. Vis, thank you for agreeing to speak with us today, about what happened to you before \u2014 what kind of life you had before the Holocaust, during and after. And as we do in all of our interviews, we want to start at the beginning. Could you tell us a little bit about where you were born, your family, your circumstances, how many siblings you had, and so on.",
            "answer": "I can tell you a lot about that, because after all, I\u2019m alive to tell you. I was born on the 16\" of September, 1930 in Amsterdam, Holland. My family tree goes back to before the French revolution. It\u2019s important to mention that, because we as Jews generally are somewhat of an errant nation. But we were very well settled there, we were utterly accultured, and I can truthfully say that Yiddish was fairly unknown to us. I have a brother who was born in 1934, and a sister in 1935. My parents, Maurice(ph) and Francisca, my father was born in 1895. And then \u2014 he still belonged to the 19 century, was rather interesting. And my mother was born in 1901, both in Amsterdam."

But my mother spent a lot of time with me. My mother was sort of a frustrated tomboy, I think. We went swimming together. She compiled lists of auto makes for me. We clipped out Rupert, the \u2014 the comic strip, Rupert the Bear, from the newspaper and made picture books out of it. I was allowed to read the newspaper.

And of course, I couldn\u2019t read at three and a half, but I could make out the pictures that were in there. So I consider that a very good sort of start of 1\u2014a sense of literacy. I\u2019ve always loved reading, I could always be find with a book \u2014 be found with a book, and then I went to school at age five. That was a very strange thing. I\u2019m born in September, as I said, and I would not be allowed into the first grade, because I became six on the 16\" of September. But as I said, I had a very scrappy mother, who didn\u2019t take this lying down, and who interpreted the \u2014 the law that you couldn\u2019t go into the first grade with age five, as saying that you could enter grade two at age six. There were more mothers like that, and I went to a preparatory Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection first grade, which was quite wonderful.

And my father said, what do you have in mind? And I said, well, I heard in school there 1s something like a kinder pensionne, a youth hostel for young children. [cough] Excuse me. And I would be very interested in going to a place like that. The kids in school think it\u2019s terrific. And my father asked around, colleagues of his in the train, mostly Jewish, and he found a place for me to go to with a colleague of his who needed some extra money, who had a bigger house than he could really afford, and the house was full of kids, and they would have a space for me.

I know a bit about Jews because I used to live in Amsterdam, blah, blah, blah. He said, but that\u2019s not really \u2014 that\u2019s not really why I wanted to ask you that question.

If your \u2014 they empty the place on Friday night, if they find you here on Saturday morning, they say hey, who are you? Leonard Vis. Never heard from. Oh, we must have overlooked you, they put you on the list and your turn is next Friday. How to get out? Uncle Henry had a plan. He said, find yourself a young boy your age, become friendly with him.

As long as the family moves, that\u2019s fine with them. Schnell, schnell und schnell. Aunt Betsy and Uncle Henry had a visa for Cuba. Of course, no boat in his right mind was going to Cuba in those days, but it helped, because Germany was not at war with Cuba and Cuba was not at war with Germany. They also had a special privilege in that their maid could bring a pot of hot food every day to the theater. Not only that, both Uncle Henry and Aunt Betsy got a hardboiled egg each. And Aunt Betsy put a note in the dirty pan and asked the maid to put in three hardboiled eggs from now on, because one was for me. I do not like hardboiled eggs. I really am not a great egg fan. I don\u2019t like the smell of eggs. I mean, if an egg is scrambled, it\u2019s fine, but a hardboiled egg, I\u2019m definitely not a friend of. However, I found a nice kid. I asked him where his parents were, he had two brothers and a sister. And I said, do you like an egg? Oh, he would love an egg. So, every morning thereafter, you know, we found each other and I gave him my egg, which made for a very good friendship. So, on the Friday night, was Kol Nidrei, the eve of Yom Kippur. We were preparing to be moved from \u2014 those who were eligible for expulsion, let me put it that way. Not Uncle Henry and Aunt Betsy. But we who were eligible for expulsion made ourself ready to be taken by streetcar to a railroad emplacement, and from there, 1n a nice, third class carriage train to Westerbork, which is on the Dutch-German border, which had a transit camp for further processing.

I\u2019ve given all my books about Schindler and all of that to the Jewish library at the Holocaust Center in Toronto. My knowledge o \u2014 my holocaust took place in Holland. And the reason that Holland had such a large loss percentage, is really due to the civil service, which carried out its orders to the letter. To the police, to the burgomasters, to the officials in the civil registry, I think the Jewish council that is being blamed in \u2014 all over the place, had very little to do with whatever there was.
