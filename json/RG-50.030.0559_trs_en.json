Mr. Vis, thank you for agreeing to speak with us today, about what happened to you before \u0152 what ki nd of life you had before the Holocaust, during and after. And as we do in all of our interviews, we want to start at the beginning. Could you tell us a little bit abou t where you were born, your family, your circumstances, how many sibli ngs you had, and so on.",
            "answer": "I can tell you a lot about that, because after all, I\u2122m alive to tell you. I was born on the 16 th of September, 1930 in Amsterdam, Holland. My family tree goes back to before the French revolution. It\u2122s important to mention that, because we as Jews generally are somewhat of an errant nation. But we were very well settled there, we were utterly accultured, and I can truthfully say that Yiddish was fairly unknown to us. I have a brother who was born in 1934, and a sister in 1935. My parents, Maurice(ph) and Francisca , my father was born in 1895. And then \u0152 he still belonged to the 19 th century, was rather interesting. And my mother was born in 1901, both in Amsterdam ."

When my mother got engaged to him, people said oh, what a shame that Francisca is marrying a non-Jew. But that was mainly because he was not \u0152 the family was very small. My mother comes from a very large family. Her maiden name is Depaauw, d-e-p-double a-u-w. And they were affiliated with the Ushers, which was a very important patrician family in Amsterdam. So \u0152 and then there was the family of Souget, s-o-u-g-e-t, of which there is an extensive family tree in Jerusalem at the genealogical institute of the University of Jerusalem."

But my mother spent a lot of time with me. My mother was sort of a frustrated tomboy, I think. We went swimming together. She compiled lists of auto makes for me. We clipped out Rupert, the \u0152 the comic strip, Rupert the Bear, from the newspaper and made picture books out of it. I was allowed to read the newspaper. The newspaper used to come in in the evening, fall on the mat behind the front door, and I wa s allowed to read it as long as I was \u0152 took \u0152 treated it neatly. And of course, I couldn\u2122t read at three and a half, but I could make out the pictures that were in there. So I consider that a very good sort of start of l \u0152 a sense of literacy. I\u2122ve always loved reading, I could always be find with a book \u0152 be found with a book, and then I went to school at age five. That was a very strange thing. I\u2122m born in September, as I said, a nd I would not be allowed into the first grade, because I became six on the 16th of September. But as I said, I had a very scrappy mother, who didn\u2122t take this lying down, and who interpreted the \u0152 the law that you couldn\u2122t go into the first grade with age five, as saying that you could enter grade two at age six. There were more mothers like that, and I went to a preparatory 6 first grade, which was quite wonderful. It must have been expensive, there were all kinds of kids of \u0152"

And my father said, what do you have in mind? And I sa id, well, I heard in school there is something like a kinder pensionne, a youth hostel for young children. [cough] Excuse me. And I would be very interested in going to a place like that. The kids in school think it\u2122s terrific. And my father asked around, collea gues of his in the train, mostly Jewish, and he found a place for me to go to with a colleague of his who needed some extra money, who had a bigger hous e than he could really afford, and the house was full of kids, and they would have a space for me .

And on Saturday morning we used to go to synagogue. And one morning in the fall of \u212241, we came back from shul, and a man stepped out of hi s house, crossed his garden path and positioned himself in front of my father and said, I\u2122d like to ask you a question. And that was a dicey thing because you didn't know who the hell the guy was and he could denounce yo u. And he said \u0152 and my father said, okay, ask the question. And he said, are you Jewish? And my father said yes. He said, I thought so. I see you come by there every Saturday morn ing with your two sons, nice thing to see. I know a bit about Jews because I used to live in Amsterdam, blah, blah, blah. He said, but that\u2122s not really \u0152 that\u2122s not really why I wanted to ask you that question. 26 I would like to know what are you going to do about the resettlement of the Dutch Jews in the east? There had been discussions that the Dutch Jews were going to be evacuated. That was an emigration department of the Jewish council, and the resettlement would take place in the ea st, where that was, we didn\u2122t know."

Anyway, they came in and they found us, they didn\u2122t even ha ve to threaten to shoot into that hiding place, you know, they knew where the door was, the girl had told them everything. And there we were, 27 Jews, and they didn\u2122t know what to do w ith us. This was the weekend \u0152 this was a Thursday, Thursday the 30 th of September, 1943. Rosh Hashanah . This year als \u0152 this year by mere chance, Rosh Hashanah is also on Thursday on the 30th of September. Calendars seem to repeat themselves. And so they took us in a moving van to a prison in Haarlem , and only on the Saturday did they move us to the Jewish theater in Amsterdam, that was a collection point."

And Uncle Henry said, we have to get you out of here post-haste, because if we don\u2122t, then we are in trouble. You are in trouble. If your \u0152 they empty the place on Friday night, if they find you here on Saturday morning, they say hey, who are you? Leonard Vis. Never heard from. Oh, we must have overlooked you, they put you on the list and your turn is next Frid ay. How to get out? Uncle Henry had a plan. He said, find yourself a young b oy your age, become friendly with him. And when these people are being called out on the Friday night, midnight, the Germans want to get this over with really quickly, they don\u2122t count the members of the family. As long as the family moves, that\u2122s fine with them. Schnell, schnell und schnell. Aunt Betsy and Uncle Henry had a visa for Cuba. Of course, no boat in his right mind was going to Cuba in those days, but it helped, because Germany was not at war with Cuba and Cuba was not at war with Germany . They also had a special privilege in that their maid could bring a pot of hot food every day to the theater. Not only that, both Uncle Henry and Aunt Betsy got a hardboiled egg each. And Aunt Betsy put a note in the dirty pan and asked the maid to put in three hardboiled eggs from now on, because one was for me. I do not like hardboiled eggs. I really am not a great egg fan. I don\u2122t like the smell of eggs. I mean, if an egg is scrambled, it\u2122s fine, but a hardboiled egg, I\u2122m definitely not a friend of. However, I found a nice kid. I asked him where his pa rents were, he had two brothers and a sister. And I said, do you like an egg? Oh, he would love an eg g. So, every morning 44 thereafter, you know, we found each other and I gave him my egg, which made for a very good friendship. So , on the Friday night, was Kol Nidrei, the eve of Yom Kippur. We were preparing to be move d from \u0152 those who were eligible for expulsion, let me put it that way. Not Uncle Henry and Aunt Betsy. But we who were eligible for expulsion made ourself ready to be taken by stre etcar to a railroad emplacement, and from there, in a nice, third class carriage train to Westerbork, which is on the Dutch-German border, which had a transit camp for further processing. So, midnight, I\u2122m hanging around the place where my young friend is as well. They call out the name of the family, the family storms out of that room."

There\u2122s a curfew in Holland from 10 in the evening til six in the morning, so there are no people watching. The streetcars take us to the railroad emplacement. There\u2122s a train waiting and I ge \u0152 I lost my friend and his fa mily in that process, because everything has to run and schnell and soldiers there, police there, and I end up in a compartment and I tell the people once we\u2122re all seated, that when the train leaves the station, I will jump from the train.

I land on a \u0152 on a \u0152 on a \u0152 on the railroad bed at \u0152 on the side of the bed, and I roll down. I wasn\u2122t a big deal. But I\u2122m stay put, I check my limbs, I have a pee, because I\u2122m nervous as hell. That much I remember. And then I have to wait until it starts to dawn, because I need daylight. I have my trusted Swiss army knife with me, they existed in those days. Not stainless steel, but regular steel.

She didn't even know that I had made it back, he explained to her that I was available for adoption. And she said, when is he coming, she says, tomorrow? He said no, not tomorrow. He said, why? He says, tomorrow\u2122s my birthday and I want to have an unencumbered birthday. I don\u2122t want to have a kid here that I have to hide. Why was that? The house that they lived in was \u0152 the rent was two dollars a week. The house was one of five houses in a little \u0152 round a little courtyard. And I asked the school kids, is there anybo dy here who knows or can gu ess what you would not get for two dollars a week in a little house lik e that? And eventually someone says, a bathroom, Mr. Vis. I said, you got it. And what do we have instead of a bathroom? In Canadian parlance, an outhouse. An d an outhouse can wreak havoc on the kishkas \u0152 on the innards of a kid in hiding. But they found something for that, because I could piggyback on the four year old\u2122s potty for my little business. But as far as my big business was concerned, my innards could not become active until well after sundown. Because in order to use an outhouse, you have to go out, and I was not allowed to go out unless it was dark. Under the cover of darkness, with a little hand dynamo so I could \u0152 hand dy namo so I could see where I \u0152 where I was going. And so I tell the kids that, I said, you have a freedom that you\u2122re not aware of, a very important freedom. And that\u2122s taking a shit when you bloody well want to.

I\u2122ve given all my books about Schindler and all of that to the Jewish library at the Holocaust Center in Toronto. My knowledge o \u0152 my holocaust took place in Holland. And the reason that Holland had such a large loss percentage, is really due to the civil service, which carried out its orders to the letter. To the police, to the burgomasters, to the officials in the civil registry, I think the Jewish council that is being blamed in \u0152 all over the place, had very little to do with whatever there was. If they hadn\u2122t been there, it would ha ve \u0152 it would have taken place anyway. So, I \u0152 I like to exonerate the Jewish council.
