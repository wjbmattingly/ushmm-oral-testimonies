The family built a six-room house outside of Rozwadow about two years before\nWorld War I. Abraham was sent to gymnasium in Czechowice, and then attended university in\nKrakow. Although he had the best grades, as a Jew, he was not admitted to medical school in\nPoland, so he attended medical school in Prague for a year or two. He returned to Poland and\nattended law school in Krakow. He had a thriving general law practice at the family home\noutside of Rozwadow for two years before the Germans invaded Poland.\nWhen they learned of the German invasion, Abraham, their sister Hanna, and a brother went to\nRussian-controlled Lvov, a four or five hour train ride. They walked and rode on a horse-drawn\nwagon part of the way.\nGermans later evicted Laura and her parents from their house, and they headed toward Lvov.\n\u201cNobody knows where to go...It was just a terrible thing to live it through,\u201d Laura says.\nThey found Laura\u2019s brothers and sisters in Lvov, and lived together. After a few weeks or\nmonths, Russians took Laura and her parents from the house, and sent them to Russia. Abraham\nand Hanna were out at their jobs. The Russians had given Abraham an office job. He moved in\nwith a friend.\nIn 1940 or 1941, Russians sent away rich Poles and others in cattle cars.\nAfter the war, Laura found the woman with whom Abraham had lived.. She told Laura that\nAbraham said a man had warned him that the Russians were coming for him. He said he would\nnot sleep at her apartment that night. Neither she nor anyone else ever saw him again.\nThis is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.\nhttp://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n2\n",
