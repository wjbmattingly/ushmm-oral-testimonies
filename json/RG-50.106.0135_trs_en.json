And then what happened, we -- they moved us in the camp and they -- the housing was like bunkhouse, they dug a hole in the ground and they put a roof and put dirt on for insulation. So it was just like in the ground because it\u2019s cold out. But I remember they had kapos, which was a leader of the camp, and he said that he needs electricity for his bunk. And I had tools, I had axes and so forth. And one time I went home and saw wires, so not thinking about, I took my axe and cut it. And the whole camp -- the construction site got dark. The Germans run around here, it must have been a power line, right now I thought about it. And I took the wire, [indecipherable] wrapped around all the wires and brought it to the camp. He never turned me in, they would have killed me right there. It was about -- they didn't know what happened. And he got electricity and a -- and our reward was he would give us ex -- a little bit extra soup. The soup was really watery soup and there probably was a couple slices of bread. Another thing happened to me once. I came back -- I was 16 and very skinny, and used to have selection. Selection is you strip half naked and a gentleman says -- there\u2019s left and right. Selections are very sensitive [indecipherable] among people who are in concentration camp. And somehow I sized up that he send me with the weaker ones. So I run away. I really run away in this particular camp. And the kapo ran after me. He beat me up, but I know how much, but in meantime he got somebody else, so to meet a quota. And we were with a lot of Hungarian people, Hungarians Jews, and they were very naive, I thought. They -- I knew the people [indecipherable] crematorium, I knew that\u2019s gas chambers there, I already knew about it but nothing you can d-do about it. And somebody said the Scharfthrer [indecipherable] big pope or rabbi, he said it\u2019s too hard, the work is for hard, you\u2019ll be sending more people -- and s -- oh yeah, the Scharftihrer said something like that, but anyway, I was spared, I really was spared. And so one time I fell down -- I walked the scaffolding and a four by four was there, the whole scaffold collapsed and I was underneath that but my brother pulled me out, I wasn\u2019t hurt.

So it\u2019s a story fact, when we were liberated we di -- we didn\u2019t know the right day he died, so my brother and I decided -- arbitrarily we picked a day because in our religion once a year we say a -- services for the person who passed away.

So, you know, we were -- whatever it is, we felt we have a little bit more. Another thing happened. Whatever the slice of bread is, we would divide it in three sections so we\u2019d have three meals a day. Some people would eat right away. Some people smoked, so that they trade the bread for some cigarettes. A lot of people had the runs, dysenteria, and that kills you right away. We would drink the coffee beans, we felt it helps us. For instance, my arms swell up like that, and was a fellow said he was [indecipherable] must have been a surgeon, he cut me right here. He cut in, let a drainage go. I was frostbitten. But my brother had a good sense of humor, so guess what he said? Things are going good, now we\u2019re being liberated. Meaning that we have bread and everything else.

In the morning you\u2019ll see the whole -- just two eyes full of cement. They would run around the kitchen, maybe something leftover, so they wouldn\u2019t get any sleep. And the Hungarian people are very naive, it really would make them mad. Like, we didn\u2019t have anything but probably shoes and a cup, and you see a person died, people were so -- see that all the teeth will move, you know, loose like. And [indecipherable] you don\u2019t need this -- you don\u2019t need the shoes, you didn\u2019t -- you don\u2019t need the- the spoon, why don\u2019t give it to me?

I liked that. But then they promised me to make me assistant manager, or manager, but that never happened. Once [indecipherable] from United States run out, people from Canada came in. And I always was first fiddle, but I never could lead the band, you know, it always bothered me. And the hours are terrible. If they don\u2019t like you -- first of all, leave money, you can\u2019t -- if you have to go to the bathroom you can\u2019t do it, because it\u2019s money. And the managers play games with you, they don\u2019t like you. Like you would work from nine to nine, with two breaks. If they don\u2019t like you, they send you for lunch half an hour at eleven and then three, from three til nine, it\u2019s a long day. So I complained to my wife and she never told me what to do, but I cannot complain because I was [indecipherable] and one time she said, you know what, she said, you\u2019ll be gray and old and still be smiling to the womans down there. Because now a young fellow would come the summertime with shorts two sizes too small and throw yourself at him. So that\u2019s the register. So I went up at school in the Capital Radio Engineering Institute, on 16 and Columbia, and I said look, I have a high school diploma, I can\u2019t prove it. And I took the radio school, is there any chance for me to enroll in your night school? They say oh, we\u2019ll think about it. And then they called me up, said we ll you exam. And apparently I did well on the math part, because I\u2019m sure my [indecipherable] was lousy, and they accepted me. So I told the manager I\u2019m going to school. He was a good guy, he said I hate you. I said why do you hate me? He said, I have to rearrange the whole -- everybody\u2019s schedule to meet your school schedule, whole school -- oh -- and store [indecipherable]. But he did it. I mean, he complained, he did it. And I started going to school but I found out I didn\u2019t have the language, so I really was struggling the first two years, my grades were lousy. C minus, barely made it, but they didn\u2019t get mad. They didn\u2019t get mad, and after two years I got the nick of it, I picked up very nicely. So I quit Giants and worked in various repair shops like Phillip\u2019s and George\u2019s and they fired me."

Reason being, I somehow cannot -- feel very uncomfortable being in Germany. In Lithuania I\u2019m actually afraid of my life, because even wa -- even though I was very young, I know the town. We were in a town about 30,000 people and I think about 8,000 Jewish people and I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m living evidence that I\u2019m alive and people might not be happy about it and I\u2019m really afraid of my life."

We took tours. Of course, I did not live with the Israelis, we lived in hotels. But I was very comfortable, I could read a paper, I could understand the newspaper. And I was very impressed that people, Jewish people are sweeping the streets, and are doing maintenance and building equipment. Like the day we left, a person came in four in the morning and said, I\u2019m a Jewish [indecipherable]. And he brought us coffee, I was very comfortable. Now, just last year, it\u2019s I think \u201998 I went to Israel, B\u2019nai Brith for a month. And something happened to me, I got sick, Marge got sick, so I could not -- I could see but not as well, but I thought that Israel changed quite a bit. More competitive and I think I just -- it\u2019s really different when I thought it should be. People are more interested in what they can get out of you and which house do you live, they live in a villa. It just did not impress me that -- that\u2019s the country should be run like that."

And oh -- I have sort of trouble, I get very emotional about it. But I was just recently where it was made a film about the Jewish brigade. People from Chicago and it was one soldier who was in the brigade. The film was okay, but after there was commentary and I thought that they said that General Eisenhower said that he would send people back where they came from. And I don\u2019t think that was true because I feel that I\u2019m -- my life I\u2019m -- my life to General Eisenhower. We were in camp, and we were li- liberated. I\u2019m not sure whether it was the third or Seventh Army, but three or four days prior, the time that it -- people -- the camp authorities, so to speak, thought th-the -- the allied forces would come in. I don\u2019t think I would have made that three or four days. And General Eisenhower came to our camp, Feldafing was a hith -- Hitler youth camp, and after that they put in refugees they called displaced persons. And I was away from him maybe an arm\u2019s length. I was very much impressed with him. He was tall, handsome, with army boots and he was very much disturbed, his eyes were filled with tears. So I really don\u2019t agree what people said, that he want to send people back to where they came from. And also they mentioned that in the camp they were not Jewish and they were very upset. I\u2019m not sure which camps the brigade came in, but our camp was solid Jewish. We were part of Dachau."
