So I became a cashier. I liked that. But then they promised me to make me assistant manager, or manager, but that never happened. Once [indecipherable] from United States run out, people from Canada came in. And I always was first fiddle, but I never could lead the band, you know, it always bothered me. And the hours are terrible. If they don\u2019t like you -- first of all, leave money, you can\u2019t -- if you have to go to the bathroom you can\u2019t do it, because it\u2019s money. And the managers play games with you, they don\u2019t like you. Like you would work from nine to nine, with two breaks. If they don\u2019t like you, they send you for lunch half an hour at eleven and then three, from three til nine, it\u2019s a long day. So I complained to my wife and she never told me what to do, but I cannot complain because I was [indecipherable] and one time she said, you know what, she said, you\u2019ll be gray and old and still be smiling to the womans down there. Because now a young fellow would come the summertime with shorts two sizes too small and throw yourself at him. So that\u2019s the register. So I went up at school in the Capital Radio Engineering Institute, on 16 and Columbia, and I said look, I have a high school diploma, I can\u2019t prove it. And I took the radio school, is there any chance for me to enroll in your night school? They say oh, we\u2019ll think about it. And then they called me up, said we ll you exam. And apparently I did well on the math part, because I\u2019m sure my [indecipherable] was lousy, and they accepted me. So I told the manager I\u2019m going to school. He was a good guy, he said I hate you. I said why do you hate me? He said, I have to rearrange the whole -- everybody\u2019s schedule to meet your school schedule, whole school -- oh -- and store [indecipherable]. But he did it. I mean, he complained, he did it. And I started going to school but I found out I didn\u2019t have the language, so I really was struggling the first two years, my grades were lousy. C minus, barely made it, but they didn\u2019t get mad. They didn\u2019t get mad, and  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And General Eisenhower came to our camp, Feldafing was a hith -- Hitler youth camp, and after that they put in refugees they called displaced persons. And I was away from him maybe an arm\u2019s length. I was very much impressed with him. He was tall, handsome, with army boots and he was very much disturbed, his eyes were filled with tears. So I really don\u2019t agree what people said, that he want to send people back to where they came from. And also they mentioned that in the camp they were not Jewish and they were very upset. I\u2019m not sure which camps the brigade came in, but our camp was solid Jewish. We were part of Dachau."

I feel he 1s a very good surgeon and is a very good man. He published several papers. His paper was one the first ones International Congress in Toronto a few years back. I\u2019m not sure where he\u2019s publishing now.

And she published several papers there. And right now she 1s practicing with her husband who is also a dentist in Baltimore. And I think -- maybe I\u2019m prejudiced, but I think she is a crackerjack dentist."
