He got married when he was 40, and he was 42 when they had me. And my mother was 27 when she got married, and was anxious to get out of Kemnets. She told me many, many times, that she got married to him very quickly, you know, he asked her to marry him, and she wanted to marry to get to Berlin, that\u2019s what she wanted. So, but she was fun loving. She had a sense of humor, and I think my father sort of kept her down, or at least it wa -- it -- that\u2019s how it seemed to me. He was a, as we Say today, a ca -- mut -- a bit of a control freak. Or maybe more than a bit."

It was, you know, I -- I would say like upper middle class, and it had a -- there was a park nearby, by Rushaplatz, or was it just a real -- a playground with a par -- I\u2019m not quite sure. Not a big park, because Berlin has very big parks, that\u2019s not one- one of them. But it was like a comfortable neighborhood, and I know that Albert Einstein lived nearby somewhere. My mother used to tell me that, not that I knew who he was at the time, but I knew he was somebody important. And I guess that was a different neighborhood, but where my- when my parents got married, not that same building that -- that I grew up in, when they got married, before they had me, they lived in a noybow, as they called it, you know, a new building, and Marlena Dietrich lived in that building. These are things that were told to me, yeah."

Like bells that you could ring, you know, and it would ring in the back, in the -- near the kitchen, like which room the maid was supposed to come and s -- I was very impressed with this, I think, cause I still remember it. But it was, you know, middle class, nothing ultra fancy. I don\u2019t even remember -- I guess it did have an elevator, the building. Yeah, it must have. I can see myself walking into the building, and yet it -- it\u2019s murky."

Too early for a young child, at least for me it was. But I don\u2019t -- because you said sounds, that\u2019s what made me think of it, because I\u2019d hear things that probably weren\u2019t even happening, but in my mind they were. Creaking sounds or something, and I was frightened to be alone, five or six, or something."

I\u2019m sure there were Jews living around, but it was -- a-as far as I ca -- I remember, when I\u2019d visit a friend, it was pretty far away, it was -- because this -- the school that I went to was a Jewish school. But, I don\u2019t think so, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s like saying, you know, where I live now in Manhattan, do I live in a Jewish neighborhood? No, I don\u2019t. A lot of Jews live there, but it\u2019s not a Jewish neighborhood. I think that\u2019s how it was in Berlin, because I didn\u2019t really think that anything was going to happen.

My mother was, she always went to -- always went to synagogue on the high holidays, and she always fasted on Yom Kippur, that was very important to her, and she -- somehow she carried that through to, you know, very late in life, in New York. And I don\u2019t remember her making holiday meals. We must have been invited, or something. I know we were invited here. It wasn\u2019t like, you know, she invited people over. She was not that much of a housewife, or cook, you know, to -- to cook for many people was not her thing. And my father didn\u2019t care, you know, as far as holidays were concerned."

She had a Bible, and sh -- I think I have it at home still -- that she used, but I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a little confused whether that was in the United States, or there."

I never called her aunt, cause I never saw her again, Tanta Trude, and my cousin, Ilsa. They had one daughter, and I was very fond of her, very close to her, or wanted to be, because I was an only child, and I was not very happy about that, so I wanted to think of her as a sister, was happy when once in awhile we\u2019d get some dresses that were the same dress, you know, in -- 1n our respective sizes. But they lived -- I know they lived a subway ride away, and I -- I think I once went there. It was sort of as if we lived in Manhattan, and they lived in Brooklyn kind of thing. That\u2019s what I s -- remember, and they were more modest -- had a more modest income, and I don\u2019t know what he did for a living, but -- but we didn\u2019t -- I -- I didn\u2019t see her as often as I would have liked. She went to a different school, and she was a little older than I was, and -- but I -- I wanted to se -- to -- to -- wanted more of a connection. Why we didn\u2019t, I -- I\u2019m not quite sure. I was really a lonely child."

She was at one -- somebody in my class, who I was good friends with, and she had a large family, so that must have been fairly -- she had a younger brother and two older brothers, and it was like a happy household, and I loved going there, because it was a lot going on, and you know, played with her brothers, and attention was paid, and meals of mi-milk and cookies, or whatever. And then I had a friend named Levia Aronfeld, who I\u2019ve seen in New York, I\u2019ve run into her, and she had -- I -- I recognized her, which was really quite something. And another person, Marion Faulk. There were quite a few. Eva Simon. I re -- just remember these names, and I did have birthday parties, yes, that I remember, had birthday parties, my mother made me birthday parties, and she had these lovely little cups and saucers, each one was different from another. I have just a couple of them left, I have them in my den, cause they -- eventually they chipped and broke, and this and that, but I li - I loved them, and it\u2019s serving -- served us cocoa in those cups, you know, each one, they were very pretty, china, you know, each one was totally different from the other. We called them Zameltussen. And maybe something will come to mind about holidays, but -- I remember a Christmas tree that she sa -- bre -- she got for when we had a maid, because she wanted it, you know, and she did it for her, we had a Christmas tree. Of course, no Christ-like ornaments on it, but it had something on it, jelly rings, or something, I don\u2019t know."

But my mother was very nervous when I was born, I know that, she\u2019s told me that, and she gave me away, sh -- and I always thought, f-for years, until I -- til my late years, you know, that my friends who are psycho -- psychologists and -- and social workers said, \u201cYou know, that wasn\u2019t really such a terrific thing.\u201d She thought she did a wonderful thing, she didn\u2019t have enough milk, and she gave me away to a clinic. Clinic is not what a clinic 1s here. Clinic is like a private thing where they -- Dr. Lungstein, she told me, out in -- it was a good distance, and she said she went there several times a week to see me, and they had a -- what do you call them, wet -- wet nurses, because she thought that I wasn\u2019t going to -- going to make it, or something. I -- I don\u2019t know if any of this really was necessary or true, but that\u2019s what she did, and that\u2019s what she told me. But it\u2019s sort of interesting, you know, as a mother and grandmother when I look back on this, and what did that really mean, to give away a newborn, and I said, \u201cHow long was that?\u201d And she -- It was like a half a year, which is sort of mind-boggling."

And then the dining room, and then a long hallway, which led to the room that the housekeeper had, and then the kitchen. And I think that was it, but it seemed very large.

We ate -- my mother\u2019s cooking was not particularly wonderful, not everybody\u2019s mother is a good cook, or a great housekeeper.

One day, my father said that he was going to Rotterdam, to see if he\u2019d get tickets to come to -- to go to New York, that he -- and the reason, I guess by that time they told me that much, that he could not -- he was under the impression that he could work there, or start a business, or something, but he could not. It wasn\u2019t permitted. So, it would have been just a question of time until his money would run out, so he went to Rotterdam, he said he was going to Rotterdam to see if we get tickets to go to New York, that\u2019s how it seemed.

It was not a refugee ship, we were going second class, which I realized not long a -- not long ago, when I went to Ellis Island, and I was listening with the headset to Tom Brokaw, I found out why I never went to Ellis Island, because we were -- I never knew, we just got off the ship when we got here, and cousins, you know, second cousins, whatever, were waiting for us here. But the reason was, if you weren\u2019t in third class, you didn\u2019t have to go to Ellis Island. That\u2019s what he said, and -- but it was quite pleasant. I remember meeting this American family, with their children, who had gone to Europe on vacation, cause it was, you know, early September, summer vacation with their children, and they befriended me because the mother, the father, they wanted their children to meet a little -- a real little German girl. And I remember they took me into the lounge of the ship, for a -- in-into the cocktail lounge in the afternoon, for a drink. And this drink turned out to be som -- it was horrible, and it turned out to be Coca-Cola, which was something that I had never -- 1-it\u2019s a very, very strange flavor, if you \u2019ve never ever had it, and I don\u2019t like it to this day. But -- And then I -- My mother bought me -- [ had it til not so long ago, a little sailor doll from that ship, with a -- with a little sailor hat, the way they had them, you know, a little white, like a little brechen 1s it? And the little black ribbon around it, with the name of the ship, and it was like a little stuffed doll, with velvet, and I lu -- I wanted it desperately, I wanted this doll, and they did get it for me, and I had it for years and years and years, you know, little sailor from -- as a souvenir. I do not ha -- remember this as an unpleasant sh -- sh -- it wa -- it was like going -- sort of like on some kind of vacation. I mean, I didn\u2019t know the difference, I\u2019d never been on a ship before, maybe it was pretty -- I wouldn\u2019t say primitive, but maybe Spartan, but it -- 1t seemed fine to me."

            "answer": "Mm, yes, I do remember -- I remember the s -- the school very well. Eventually, after a few years, we moved across the street from that school, but at -- the first apartment was, I remember the address, 650 West 172\" Street. That was off between Broadway and Fort Washington Avenue, and the public school, PS 173 was on the corner of Fort Washington Avenue and 173\" Street, so I just had to walk dow -- you know, two blocks, one down and one across. I remember an interview, vaguely. My father taking me to school, and they telling me, whoever, maybe it was the principal, that -- what grade they were putting me into. They put me into four A. In those days the semesters were split up, A and B, ha-half a year, you know, not like fourth grade, A and B. So it was the beginning of the f-fourth year, four A, which was five sem -- five semesters less than what I should have been in, two and a half years. And they said that when I would learn English, that it would be sort of automatic that I would catch up with myself, which was not true. And I remember feeling very -- feeling very bad about that, you know, w-with -- with these young kids. Again, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a filmy kind of dreamy memory, seeing myself in that class, but I was not happy to be with children that were that much younger, and I didn\u2019t speak any English, and also, I don\u2019t remember other children that I was -- could be friends with, or drawn to, because there were other little German girls or boys in the class. It was just me. So I guess they came later, or at other times. And eventually I did become a very good student, and it was only because of that that I skipped a lot of grades, and I wen -- went to summer school somewhere in - you know, before finishing public school, that I made up at least a year or two, and then I -- then in junior high school, I was put in what they called RA, it was called rapid advance classes, you know, for kids who were doing well, and made it two years out of three, or something like that. But in the end, after high school, graduating high school, I just a pi -- I came out just about right, so if I hadn\u2019t been, I\u2019d be going to school til I was -- the end of my 18\" year, I think. But school, I remember my f -- early on, I had to -- I came home with a poem, which I had to learn by heart. And my father, as I told you, was -- didn\u2019t have much patience, and I just couldn\u2019t get it into my head, I couldn\u2019t seem to grasp it, the engli -- an-and he smacked me, you know, for again not getting it right, and it turned out to be \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner,\u201d that\u2019s what that poem was. I didn\u2019t enjoy school ats -- at first, but the kids were -- I -- I guess they were all -- all right. I -- I don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t remember them being particularly -- I felt isolated, but I don\u2019t remember being, you know, taunted, or -- particularly one way or another, particularly cruel, or -- but isolated. And early on, going to the -- as a school outing, going to the 1939 World\u2019s Fair, that was very thrilling. I re -- I remember doing that, and enjoyable. And I think I only did it once after that, on my own with family or somebody else. But once I got the language, then -- and also I was becoming a teenager, I became a much happier child, and really sort of found myself, which wasn't easy with my parents and these circumstances, you know, little apartment and I was -- I felt -- I never had a room of my own, I slept in the living room. My parents never had a bedroom again, ever. The other room was -- was had always two rooms, and it was sort of like a -- with two couches in it, each -- they slept separately, sort of like a studio, like you sometimes get in a motel, L-shaped, one couch here, one couch there. In that apartment as well as the next apartment, as well as their last apartment, long after I was married. And I slept in the living room, I was -- this is sort of personal, has -- I don\u2019t know, much to do with anything on this subject, but I was always -- well, I guess sort of ashamed of the way we lived, and also, you know, I didn\u2019t -- the friends that I eventually made, their apartments seemed much nicer, and they had sisters and brothers. It was not all that happy at home, and my mother was working right from the beginning here. My father, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t. He -- I guess he came with a little too much money, that he didn\u2019t need to be forced into taking a job, or -- or getting -- or starting all over, or like most of their friends -- friend\u2019s husbands did. Some of them were doctors, and they started off, you know, the way they do, doing I don\u2019t know, working as -- I don\u2019t know, in -- in -- learning how to s -- you know, their English, and taking medical exam -- and much more difficult things they -- but my father never really did, and my mother -- my mother worked in the -- no, that came later. She worked in people\u2019s apartments, cleaning or something, it -- it -- I -- it\u2019s not such a happy childhood. And she was not happy with my father\u2019s being home, so she got up and did something, and eventually she worked in the garment center in New York, which she liked. She liked being out on her own, and working."

It was- | -- | met that man, they both survived, even though she was married to somebody that -- you know, not a happy marriage, she managed to fall in love there, which 1s sort -- sort of, you know, as an adult, life goes on, even those things happen there. But anyway, when she came, she -- I would be angry with her for not -- for being str-strict, you know, and -- and sort of siding with my father on issues, whatever they were, things that I wanted to do. It was not -- not easy for me as a -- the upbringing of my parents. I think that was one of the reasons I got married very early. The other was that my mother pushed me into it."

Somehow you just -- naturally you gravitate to them, you know?

And I leaf through this book, and I couldn\u2019t believe it, there was a picture of me and my cla -- in my classroom, with me in it, my -- all the -- all my classmates from, I think, 1935. And when I saw that, I said, I\u2019ve got to -- I said, \u201cHow did they got ahold of this picture?\u201d Well, obviously, somebody else had the same class picture, I found that out subsequently, somebody who lived in England, and submitted it to them. At any rate, I -- I -- it -- it piqued my interest, and I now -- I thought I wanted to go to Berlin, and get this trip that my parents never took advantage of. So I got in touch, it\u2019s a lengthy involvement, I won\u2019t go into it. And we had a lot of corens -- correspondence back and forth. I told him about the picture, they were very interested in the picture, and I traced it, and said I could identify the g -- most of the girls to this day, which I did do, and then they published it in yet another publication that they had, a g -- like a newsletter, that went to all former Berliners, and I started receiving mail from all these people because they - -- it said something about Anita Sockol in New York, blah, blah, blah, and I started receiving them. And because of this -- so I had two things going on at the same time, it was very exciting really, receiving these letters, and also questions. Did I know somebody named Ilsa Plachte, and- because that was a very good friend of mine, and where does she live? And I would call that person back, they lived in Columbus, Ohio. I said, \u201cThat was my cousin, I heard that, you know, she died in Auschwitz.\u201d Other people wrote to me, they were -- th -- this woman just knew the name, and as I was busy writing and corresponding with these other people, I was also talking to this woman in Berlin, and sort of pushing it to get the trip. She said I was too young, if I wanted to come with my mother. And I said, \u201cAt this point, my mother couldn\u2019t possibly travel.\u201d And -- But because of it, I think they gave it to me. And I did go on the trip to Berlin, in 1989, in the spring. March, I believe it was, before the wall came down. And it was a very interesting trip, with many -- with wonderful things that they did for us, and yet you had such -- such strange feelings, everybody did, you know. And I have a cousin who lives -- second cousin who lived in Berlin at the time, and the free time that we had, he showed me the railroad tracks, you know, over a bridge, that\u2019s where the Jews were shipped to Auschwitz from, and a little doorway that looked like a closet, you know, you\u2019d walk right by. And he said, \u201cIn there is an Orthodox shul,\u201d which you\u2019d -- you\u2019d never think there was anything in there. And told me -- So, I had very mixed feelings. At night I couldn\u2019t sleep from all the things that were -- that my -- my feelings were, you know, accosted with. And we met the mayor of Berlin, he talked to us, and there were cocktail parties. We met a senator, a woman senator, and they made these speeches, dear former citizens, and it was very strange. Very difficult to explain the -- can\u2019t say love, but the -- some kind -- some kind of memories, and yet the -- the anti-German feeling that you -- that sort of rides over everything. It -- It was very strange, and we went to see -- everybody ran to s -- to wherever they lived. And there was a man who was [indecipherable] from this area, I think he was from Maryland, and he lived near where I lived, and we went to -- by train through eastern Berlin, to where I lived, and the address existed, but not the building, so they must have kept the address, but -- you know, but it was some modern, ugly building, cause of -- obviously that whole area was bombed out, and like rebuilt."

And it\u2019s -- that one referred to different -- it just mentioned different concentration camps, like on a -- on a post, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s well done, and I think that people just go about their business, nobody looks at it. And that\u2019s a spot sort of like Times Square. What they do look at, and it is interesting, 1s that church. You must have seen that church, we bombed out that famous cathedral, and they left that standing there in the middle of modern Berlin, which is quite interesting, but that\u2019s just a reminder of the war, not -- nothing to do with Germans -- nothing to do with Jews.

As far as religion is concerned, well, I wasn\u2019t brought up on a religious home. My first husband was very religious. I was not, that was a bad combination.

I think it\u2019s a fabulous museum, it\u2019s portrayed very, very well, and all the high tech things, and all the little films you can see. I haven\u2019t really begin -- begun to scratch the surface, if I really wanted to see everything, cause I\u2019m never here long enough.

And in films, I ge -- I mean, I think much more -- I think s -- it\u2019s -- much more is still being said, and I think as we get more sophisticated, and as the generation 1s ready to die out, that there are scholars and people still writing from -- and pursuing it from, then- and researching it from different angles, and different points of view. Especially, I\u2019m interested -- I am interested a lot in -- well, like that Daniel Goldhagen book, sort of to prove to myself that -- about the basic German, how could this really happen, that it isn\u2019t just the hierarchy and everything that we know, that it could not really have happened without the cooperation of the ordinary German. I feel like it\u2019s in their blood, I really do feel that. There are exceptions of course, but -- I mean, how -- all the little things that happened day to day, how c -- how could anybody take just stones, and smash windows, and take an old man in -- into the street, you know on an individual basis, when you look at it that way. Nevermind the concentration camps, before the concentration camps, people that you knew, and were your neighbors, and you knew them all your life, and all of a sudden you turned your back on -- what does it take in a person to do that? You know, one to one. I -- I have to wonder about that. What kind of people are those? And other countries, you know, you take a country like Denmark, was it? And they\u2019re just like good people. They just didn\u2019t, and they wouldn\u2019t. You know, it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know what that is, when you lump it together as one country.

That\u2019s why I never want to go to any of those other countries. I only went to Berlin, because after all, well, it was offered to me, and it was -- there is a fascination, it\u2019s a morbid fascination to see the city. And it\u2019s also an interesting city."

She wanted to come with me today, you know, but that was not appropriate. But she is interested, she reads books on it.

My other daughter is not all that interested, and also I tried, you know, even though it\u2019s German, but it is a language, when they were young, I tried to speak German to them. My mother always said it doesn\u2019t hurt to know another language, which we all know. But they really fought me on it, and I just gave up after awhile.

But how did -- did I speak to them about it? I -- I guess it was maybe -- they would -- they did become interested, but I think they spoke more to my parents, probably, than to me. And they became interested when they were adults, but then they didn\u2019t really say much. My father didn\u2019t want to talk about it, and -- how he came here, and this and that.

I -- I never felt that I wanted to move there, or live there. As a matter of fact, when I was there the first time, which is -- was in 1963, after a very wonderful trip to Europe.

No, I -- it\u2019s -- I\u2019m -- I don\u2019t have a -- I\u2019m happy that it exists, but I don\u2019t, personally no, I don\u2019t have -- and I have relatives there, and I care about them, and we are in constant touch through the years, letters and sometimes phone calls.

I\u2019d had the bad luck to go on a poor tour -- poorly organized tour, it really wasn\u2019t a tour at all, and I -- if it weren\u2019t for my cousins there, it would have been a pretty disastrous trip, cause I was really on my own. It was sold as a tour, but it was -- when you got there, it was really like a day tour. I could have booked that myself, to see, always with different people, and different places, you know, and put -- it was like a day tour in Tel Aviv, or Jerusalem. And at the end of the day you were plunked down at your hotel, and you had nobody. But as I said, I had my family there and they really saved the trip for me.
