So I had forgotten about the kosher uh laws until I came to the States to live with my aunt, but my parents both came from an orthodox family.

I don't know what other part of Belgium did. The first thing was, no rad...the Jews were not allowed to have radios. We were not allowed to go to school. We had to register as Jews and that meant that we took identification cards to uh the Foreign Ministry and they stamped a big red stamp on it, on the inside that said Juda (ph), and we had to wear the uh ____ David on the chest. As a matter of fact uh I remember distinctly the students from the colleges some things and I don't know if mocking is the right term, used to wear them, the Star of David, and they made bonfires in mockery of the Jewish star, and uh I don't know... it was a matter of days or a week, they...there were some young people who had to go to a certai n area and report as Jews and they had to go with clothing, with their with their ration stamps and clothi ng and food and they were young teenagers, two of my very close friends uh that I was going to high school with. The one I had gone to grade school also had to go. I was fifteen. They were about fourteen. They were just a little bit younger than I am, and the families let them go because no one knew, no one had any idea what the reason was, why, what for. We knew in Belgium about the uh Jews escaping from Germany. A lot of them ended up in Bel...in uh Belgium, but no one knew what what was happening, so they went, and I don't know if it was a week later, ten days later or a few days later, they called men of certain ages and my father was called to go to, supposedly to Dunkirk (ph) to build up fortifications."

            "answer": "What was it like? We had...my parents were were wonderful. I mean everybody did the black market like to have food and things , and my parents did everything. We did not feel...oh, I remember my mother wa s afraid for me because she remembered the Kosacks (ph), you know, raping, and I was going on...let's see...I wa s going on fourteen and she was afraid for me, but the the Germans...someone asked me just not long ago if the Germans did anything like to rape a woman. Germans, and I'm talk ing Liege...probably the whole Belgium, I'm not sure...were not allowed to approach a civilian on the streets. They had houses, prostitution homes, reserved for soldiers. They never never touched anyone on the streets, and I think, if I remember, this was done for propaganda purposes to show how good the Germans were, that they were not our enemies, but they never never touched a woman. Belgium had food. Anything we had...coffee, we used to roast coffee after four years of war, and we had to close the windows because the coffee smelled when you roas ted it. We had rice...everything found its way on black market. My father, before we went into hiding, used to get on his bicycle and go and get, you know, the carp is not the same as th e American carp. It's clean. And he would sell that on the market because that was not ratione d. They would...he would go to the farmers and sometimes like bring eggs because that was highly rationed. Now the farmers had quotas to turn in depending on the size of their farms, whether it was butter or eggs, so what they used to do is they used to be quote, robbed. Somebody came duri ng the night or early in the morning and they were robbed, and all of that found its way on the black market, so as far as where we were in Belgium, we had food. We never went hungry. Ne ver. Clothing...it's not the way of life here. You know, you bought a dress and you wore it until you outgrew it and then it went down to your younger sister and it was passed down. My my mother had been a man's tailor, so whatever pieces of fabric were left around, we managed to scrounge, and we wore the same things over 4 and over, but we had clothes and for money you could buy and it's hard to explain. My parents were honest people but anyone who understands war situation knows that if you want to survive in an occupied country, you do black markets. In other words, there were ration stamps. I was...never had money floating in my hands as much as...that's be fore we went into hiding...this is the first two years of war. The ration stamps were like like postage stamps and they used to make false ones. They used to duplicate them , like making fake money and it used to find its way on the black market, and that's what my fath er did and I don't know where he got his...he did not produce them. I don't who produced them, but we...my father used to buy them, get them and sell them and make money th at way, and then wherever you could get either farm produce or I don't remember meat but I remember distinctly fish and eggs, whatever, and especially the stamps so I was old enough that if a customer came and wanted stamps, you see, and you could tell they were fake. But remember that the civilian...I mean Ge rmans did not occupy everything and besides...they called them Alexis (ph) patrol Germans...t hey were all...everybody had to because you had a pad of butter a month as a ration. I learned to drink coffee without sugar for that reason, because my mother saved it to make jellies and things and to this day I don't drink coffee with sugar for for that reason, but anything you wanted except bananas. Fresh fruit, because Belgium had Belgium Congo and you could find on black market. So we ate and there was uh, you know, I I remember the first German. We were petrified of them, you know, but the Germans were not all over. The country was run by Belgium civilians, so you didn't even see them that much. It's just that we had a uh a concern (ph) very close by with...a block, a block and a half of where I lived, so you did see more of the soldiers than maybe if you lived in an area where the concern (ph) was not close by, but otherwise it was all run and all occupied by by civilians, by by the Belgiums, so the first two years uh ther e was noth...I did not...if I think back, besides seeing the first Germans and clinging to my mother, uh you know, you saw them coming with their rifles and as much as we could still co mprehend uh once we got going I did not feel...there was no persecution. There was nothing. We conti nued to go to school, so there was nothing to make us feel...I think my parents sort of protected us to to to what really could be. I don't know, but the brunt of it was on my parents because they had gone through World War I with the, you know, the Kosacks and they remembered but we didn't."

No idea that it would...that there would be...I did not comprehend at the time, but I know that when the Germans invaded Poland and my mother, who I'm sure was very smart, wanted to come to the to the United States, and we had one aunt, her sister , the only one, in Cleveland, so I ended up in Cleveland, but it didn't work out. I won't go into it because...but uh and we knew of the, for instance, the Kristallnacht. I did not comprehend it. You have to remember that I was much younger and children were not, didn't have televisi on like here today so we did not comprehend the full meaning of it. We knew the German Jews were persecuted because German Jews came into Belgium in running away from Germany and we had German Jews there. I personally as a young girl did not come in contact with other young girls.

You know, uh in the capital city, your port...but I did not have any contacts that I remember with anyone who came out of Germany or...I think there may...probably most of them were German, not even Austrian...I think Ger...I know Germans came in but I did not have any contact with them.

We had to register as Jews and then they started deporting only the young people and I don't know if they were boys. For some reason or other I...these two friends of mine (coughing) ...excuse me...(coughing)...had to go and then when they called my father, that's when he went in to turn to this Catholic family who was very stau nch. They had a son who was Trappist monk as a matter of fact, and he was in the country, knew of the house, rented the house for us for six months, and we moved there. There were three rooms upstairs, two rooms downstairs. We had outdoor facilities. My father grew a garden, a big vegetable garden. He helped the farmers and we used to go down to the farmer to get fresh m ilk. I can still taste the milk. I couldn't drink it today. It was just drained from the uh the cheese cloth that they used to strain it. We burned wood and then this uh couple came to hide with us. I don't know if it was a month or two after we went into hiding. She had worked for my pare nts uh as a uh as a tail...in tailoring. He was a friend of the family who also, who had come from Czechoslovakia. He had joined us because we were from Czechoslovakia and they got ma rried, and I don't know how they found out, but they knew where we were and they joined us so we had my parents, a nd I was the oldest of three...my two sisters...and then we had a cous in who was eight years old at the time whose mother had died many years befo re when he was a young child whose father left him when the Germans started with the Jews. He had remarried and the stepmother brought him to us, so we had four in our family, and then Rochelle (ph) and her husband and the baby who was not quite a year old. They shared a room. My parents had a room and I don't remember where my little cousin slept, but the three of us slept in one room and we had to go to the stream to get water and to heat the water. We had to use outdoor f acilities and we had woods behind the house and farmland in front of us. During the weed-cuttin g season we used to go behind the farmers when they cut the weeds and we called it in French _____...you follow the the farmers and you pick the weeds that is left behind. We put them in big burlap sacks, went down to the flour mills and then we used to...my mother used to prepare the bread and then take them to the farmers and bake them in the outdoor oven. If you ever ta sted...yes...bread baked in wooden ovens and uh we used to get...we had identification. Our names were changed from...my maiden name was Adler and Frida is a German name...it's a foreign name , and my name was changed to Fernand Albert (ph)...in English it's pronounced Albert, and my middl e sister, my little sister kept the same name but my little cousin was Zeigmund which is typi cally a German name. His father was from Czechoslovakia, so we changed it to Simone ( ph), which is Simon in English, and I remember we told him if you ever want to see your father, your name is Simone Adler and you're not to tell anyone. Of course, his father made it. He didn' t. And it took no time at all for the Catholics around the villages to know we were Jewish but no one, no one ever...I mean I remember one time the farmers came because the Germans we re looking for I don't know what and we went into the woods and because the farmers warned us . My sister and I used to go into the city everyday to get our ration stamps on our real names and one time the citizens who were handing 6 out the ration stamps...the German s were looking for something or other, and they put us in the back of the old school until the Germans disapp eared and then I don't know exactly how...before the Germans uh came to arrest the family and I think...I can't...don't know how my parents found out. It may be the same person who made out the false ID papers for us...found a place for me to go into the city and I became a maid. It was a woman. She was from Alsace-Lorraine (ph). She was a widow to a coal mining engineer and she ha d a son who was at that time forty years old who was a gynecologist and babies were delivered at home in those days and he received patients in his home two afternoons a week and it was a wealthy home which means they had a live-in maid and someone who came three times a w eek. I went in. They knew I was Jewish. I went in and the two...the day woman left, so I did the work of two women. I scrubbed white marble halls. I scrubbed Persian rugs. I sc rubbed...I mean the wood...I don't know what the wood is called in English...it was...and the woman used to go, you know, this is coal furnaces, and she used to go like this to make sure there was no dust. I had...she did the cooking and then when he used to come in, they used to have a cocktail because this is typical French way of living and relaxing. When he went to deliv er a baby, you know, they went hours before and when dinner...when they were ready for dinner they rang a bell, and I served and then I went into the kitchen and I ate my dinner and then if uh...you know the French eat everything on a different dish, and I did the dishes, not in a dishwasher, but we had...they were wealthy enough to have water that was heated not in the same manner as here but the water was...you didn't have to heat it on the stove. Also he received patients. I had to sterilize his instruments and I maintained a house, a three-floor house, and you have to appreciate how to clean Persian rugs. I mean not carpeting, her...we're back into Persian r ugs. Parquet, uh parquet, the real parquet that I had to scrub with my feet and the big pads and I stayed there until my sister, my middle sister...my my sister Bertha wa s also placed in a doctor's home in the country for that purpose also and she was not feeling well and the doctor told her to go home to rest and that's when on a Sunday morning on May 5...I used to go home ever y other weekend on my bicycle. Traveled by bicycle. I used to go home uh over night. Sh e...the lady of the house, the lady of the house allowed me to go home, but usually maids used to go home, get weekends off but she took advantage of my situation. I went home every other weekend, and I got a phone call that was messaged (ph), saying to me not to go home, a nd I got...I understood that the Germans had been at the house. Now to re-track...my father was ill and I...all I remember his eye was broken outside and like he had an ear infection, an eye infection. The country doctor treated him, sent him to the hospital and of course the hospital was in the city in Liege. He came to the hospital on Friday. My sister was supposed to come in and bring him shaving cream and soap for bathing...you did not get these things...they were black market, the good ones...and my sister never came in and I got word that...I understood the fam...the Germans came and the family and the other couple were picked up. Doctor Bastat (ph) told...where I was in hiding...managed to get my father released from the hospital, went to the hospital and my fath er and I got on a bus to go to the village to see what had happened and I'll never forget it. My father went on one end of the bus, me on the other end and he says if one of us gets picked up, we don't know the other one. I can see my father. If I would have been picked up, my father ignoring me. Then we saw the farmers and they told us that what they did is they went to...you know, this is this is a little village with little passage, little road, not even a road, leading to the house, and they brought the family from the house to the main road and they questioned my my mother and my mother said that these were not their child ren...her children, and they were there for her...their health, wh...which was common practice, because we cam e from coal-mining countries and a lot of 7 children from the schools were sent to the country, but they didn't take it and they asked where my father was and my little sister said in the hospital, and I understand the German slapped her for lying. This came from the farmers who we re there when the Gestapo picked up my...the family and you know, all the people at five o'cloc k in the morning. Also, in between while in hiding, my two sisters and my cousin were pla ced in an orphanage which, of course, was Catholic but it was not working out for what ever reason it was...I don't know...I didn't get involved in these things, so they were in an orphanage for a while and then came home and the reason I went into become a maid and they tried with my little sister is for what exactly what happened is so you wouldn't be together if anyt hing happened, and there was...I remember a man who worked in cutting the woods behind us who wanted to take my little cousin. My mother was afraid to let him go. She was afraid something would happen to him and nothing to us, so he was taken with my parents. My par...uh they were arrested May 5 at five o'clock in the morning by the Gestapo and we had (cough)...we have a citadel (ph) and it's like in the suburb of Liege that was unoccupied but the Germans occupi ed it and they gathered the Jews from Liege there and they stayed there until May, May 12th and then they were sent on to Maline (ph) which is a city between Brussels and Antwerp where they gathered the Je ws from Belgium. While they were in the citadel with some packages, with whatever food and clothing or whatever was needed into the citadel and Rochelle (ph) w ho's the only one who survived told me that a German gave her milk through the bars every si ngle day. There were some Germans who were helping people escape, get out of the citadel because the citadel also hol...held Belgium civilians who did underground for uh underground sabotage and my father tried to pay, because it was done for money, to have my mother and the chil dren taken out of there but the Germans who were doing it were caught and were killed by the Germans, so that...yes...this is, this is for real. They were Germans. You have to realize not al l Germans were Gestapos. Not all Germans were Nazis. There were Germans who helped. Whethe r they did it for money or because they cared I don't know, but I know my father had found out th at it could be done and...but the Ger...these German soldiers who were helping, whether th ey were uh people who did sabotage or Jews, were killed, were shot, you know, by their own people. Said couldn't be done. We thought they would...this was, you have to realize, this is May of 1944. D-Day was June 6th. The Allied troops were bombing supposedly the railroads but they did not damage the railroads enough to stop the trains from going out, so they thought they would not be deported. Not only that, someone, some Catholic people f ound out when they were going out of Liege but they did not dare tell my father because my fa ther went out of his mind, and my father tried everything which way he could to do something or to join them and then went on to Maline and I stayed with Monsieur Madame LeBare (ph) who they were going in between with correspondence. My aunt and uncle had lived there and then went to France when Jews went into hiding. Jewelry which was not jewelry with diamonds. There were gold so you could sell it to buy food, were brought out of the citadel to their homes and hande d to us and I went to stay with them for just a few days but could not stay because he too, Monsieur LeBare was also in hiding and I went on to Brussels to be closer to Maline to be able to send care packages and I stayed with a Jewish man who had intermarried a non-Jewish woman. In Belgium when there was an inter-marriage, they did not touch the Jews and I spent the last few months of the war in Brussels, when I say in hiding...I walked the streets. I went to the library and read books. As a matter of fact I had surgery. I had my appendix out and I went into a Catholic hospital and I remember the Allied troops were bombing at the time, getting ready for D-Day, and I went in. I remember wearing a blue 8 nightgown and being on the elevator and Madame Freedman said to me, she said you have to be careful, you know, when you go under...these these were ether, you know...they put the mask on you. She says some people when they go under an esthetic, they talk and I went and I had my appendix out and the bombs were flying all over and I remember waking up and I can see the Virgin Mary on the ceiling and I kept saying in French, there's something I can't talk about. There's something I can't talk about. And I happe ned to be in a room with people who did not speak French. You know Belgium is bilingual. They spoke Flemish. They spoke...they didn't speak French, and I stayed there...you know, those were the days they kept you in the hospital for two weeks, and that's when D-Day had happened and the Allied troops came into Brussels in September and my father managed to get himsel f in jail, in a in a prison, Belgium prison, because...I don't know how he managed it but he sa id he used to go to help the the underground to fight. He used to go to the farmers and quote, rob them, to feed the underground people. Somehow or other...I don't know wh at he did...he got himself in ja il, got himself a lawyer, and I went to the lawyer. I said you have my father released, I'll kill you. My father was in jail...I don't think he ever forgave me for it...the last th ree months of the war an d I left Brussels and I decided to go home for to be home with my father for my 18th birthday, and my birthday's September 14. Got on a train, got as far as _____ which is halfway between Brussels and Liege and didn't realize because Brussels they just wa lked in...the British and the Canadians came in, and didn't realize they were still fighting on the outskirts of Liege, because it's the closest place to Germany. We had it when the Germans came in in reverse, and I stayed with Monsieur, Madame LeBare and got my father out of jail some how. He was an alien. They were going to send him to Czechoslovakia, but everything was prove n and I went to live with my father. We managed...we were bombed. We had the buzz bombs. A place to live was hard to get, so I went back with my father and people started coming out of the camps and coming home and we were hoping and some man and I don't remember his name ...a Jew...came came out of the camp. My father was going to palm readers, to fortune tell ers, everything, and this man told my father, don't keep hoping. I took the bodies out myself from the crematories. You have to realize that they went out when Hitler had the final...came up with the final solution and they went into Auschwitz on May 21 according to Rochelle. They left uh Belgium 19. Arrived on the 21 and they separated women and children and Rochelle 's husband went on a march. Didn't make it. That's what she told me, and when they went in, somebody told her to hand the baby to my mother, and afterwards they told her she would never see the child. My mother was lost because my cousin was ten. My little sister was...l et's see...I was going on eighteen, so my littler sister...six...eighteen...fourteen...I was told that my middle sister was given the option of either going to the women's camp or stayin g with my mother, and she choos e to stay with mother. You have to realize they didn't know about the gas ch ambers, and they went in immediately. They did...were not choosed for experiments, and this was the final solution and they went in immediately.

They would they would keep the identi...the ID's and say come back and get them, but the pe ople never went back to get them, so they got wise, you see, and they would hold whoever they had and I heard, I remember hearing of people being tortured to the extent I remember one instance of uh very clearly that somebody committed suicide.

If men went out to work and they were due home at five o'clock and word I mean spread like wildfire. You knew when there was sabotage right after it happened. You knew what was going on at all times. If a man, if there was...something had happened and your husband or your father didn't come home at five o'clock, starting from five o'clock until he got home fifteen minutes la te, you trembled. You waited and you hoped they hadn't been picked up. But that was not to the Jews. That was to every Belgian citizen because of the very high rate of sabotage that was going in Liege. Now you have to realize that the French Belgiums ha ted the Germans. We'r e not talking about the Flemish. We were orthodox, but it was not th e orthodox that are known in Antwerp. I mean, you know, my father did not wear a yarmulke (ph) . I understand my mother was married with a shidle (ph), but of course did not live that way. The synagogue was orthodox. We didn't have a rabbi. He went to Russia for a visit and was caught during the war. The Belgian Jews except maybe for Antwerp...we're talking Liege...people my generation and older, were immigrants. They came mainly from Poland to work the coal mining countries and then went into businesses, tailors, furriers, merchants, and they worked their way out. Belgium is a modern country, uh very open, and you could get yourself financially quite comfortable, even as a Jew. As an alien you had to register. It was...all aliens. There were Italians and then after the Sp...during the Spanish Revolution we picked up not many Spanish because they went mainly to France, so you 12 had aliens but not Jews. Now I am talking the Fren ch part of Belgium. I am not versed of what went on in Antwerp, but the Flemish Belgium may be a little, may have been a little more proGerman than the French Belgium. The Belgium, the ____ hate the Germans, remembered World War I. They did not...the the the...when I say uneducated, we all went to school until like age 12. Everybody we nt to school. Were not cosmopolitan. They didn't know of a Jew. I never was pointed out, made to feel different. I I remember going to school with matzos.

There was not the exchange that children have today. This is why St. Nicholas day, Easter e gg hunt, uh the the children have communion.

Whoever reported us didn't realize that I was missing but they did ask where my father was and my little sister said my father was in the hospital and the German slapped her for lying. In this case the farmers who did not specifically do something physical for us like making the pa pers or something, but they knew we were Jewish. We had food. We had eggs. We had mil k. We had everything we wanted. My father worked for it, but uh nobody paid for us you see. I mean there was no exchanges, you know, wherever...I don't know where we got the meat. I remember a ham, a smoked ham, and my mother never touched it. I mean my mother could not get away from the kosher laws even though the meat she ate was not kosher. The farm ers were there to notify us. Why they didn't know...they came at five o'clock in the morning. If they would have known I can assure you we would have been warned, but this was March 5. Remember D-Day was June 6th. The Allied troops were getting ready for D-Day. There was heavy bombing. Hitler was fighting on the Russian front where all the Ger...they needed the soldiers on the Russian front, so you had the Catholic citizen, the Belgium citizen, in hiding because they didn't want to go to work in Germany, and it's hard to comprehend. How do you hide in your own house, but everybody was hiding, and as a whole, whoever had to send the letters out to say yes we have to go to the train station and you have to report because you have to go to Germany, these people were against the Germans too, so if you had _____ where where...I don' t know what the percentage was, but there were not many. All you needed is one or two an d they had to be careful that the underground didn't kill them because the Catholics were Germ an-haters enough to do it because I know they did it whoever caught. As a matte r of fact, when the Jews came back from the camps, Belgium Jews in Liege did not own property, did not own houses. For some reason there was a couple...and we were not friends of theirs...owned a house. The family, a boy, girl, mother and father, were deported. The girl and the boy cam e back. They were around my age...I don't remember...they were one of the first ones to come back from the camp. The _____ had 17 occupied their house. Do you know what happened when they came back? People went in and had a bonfire throwing them out of the house, you see. So the fear we had was the fear of being caught and being caught in a cluster, which had happ...which happened. You see, if my sister hadn't been sick, she too would have survived. Uh we were also afraid of another Jew because you...the list, the names of the Jews and I'm talking strictly Liege, that it got out, was handed out, was prepared by a Jewish family. They ended up in hiding. As a matter of fact, they had two daughters, one my age and one a little bit olde r. They ended up in hiding and you know, people under certain circumstances do cert ain things to save their life. I think it's well known that certain people did things in the camps, that it went on at top levels in trying to save their lives. This not unknown. It's not uh surfaced as much as what we went though, but there was a Jewish couple...I can't think of their name. Only the da ughter's name I remember. After the war, they were shunned. The older daughter ended up going with an Amer ican who was not Jewish...he was Protestant...someplace in Tennessee or some thing. She was pregnant before she was married. Now we're going back to the days when when this happened it was the worst thing that could happen. Everybody says he deserves it. So you were also concerned of what another Jew might do in order to save his...I think when everybody went into hiding, every one realized no one could save themselves no matter what they did, so this this man who who who did this, ended up in hiding like everybody else, but he was...t hey were separated from the girls. The girls ended up in a Catholic home. What you also had...my parents, my mother was a very good person, very soft-hearted, and this is how this couple, Rochelle and her husband and the baby, came in hiding with us, because we wanted to help them but it would have been much smarter if we didn't, if...we should have been more selfish so you didn't have as large a cluster of people together, but my parents knew her when she was what, fifteen, sixteen, and he was from Czechoslovakia. They knew him as a youngster, so they did for them and we went in together, but as a whole, Jews did not...I think my father ran into the man who had given out the list because you know you walked the street, you went in to the city, and he knew the two girls were in a Catholic home and he wouldn't tell my fath er where because he didn't want...you see, he was smart in a way. He didn't want other Jews to find out because the more you had, the more dangerous it was for them. So the idea was to do the best you could for yourself, but not do for another one, not to be caught in a cluster, but we were in a cluster no matter how we tried. And uh Rochelle and...they came...I don't know how much later. It was it was not a month because after the the teenagers were, you know, had to go out and no one, no one that I know of in that group came back. This was right at the beginning. They came...it mi ght have been a week later, ten days later, that they called them in, so they came and joined us and we were two families together which was not good so what happens when the Gestapo came, everybody was together. Why Rochelle and her husband never tried to go someplace else...I guess we felt very wellprotected because there was no anti-Semitism. N obody turned in anyone you see. No one turned in anyone, except the ____ because they were underground people that were being picked up and they were trying to find out who was doing it. Sure they found out. Sunday...my family. Thursday the twin brothers who were supposed to have gone up to Germany. Not only that, I think they were working with the underground, and then that...when it was found out that there were things going on uh before and they were trying to find out who was selling out, what was going...I don't know."

I went to pieces. I was crying. I didn't want want to believe it. And she told me to...she arranged for me to go to the movie with her with her son, which I didn't want to go. And she says the...I must go and I don't remember which movie I saw. I know it wasn't an American movie. They didn't allow it. And I think that the last three months I must have lived on a...first of all my father was in jail. I was separated from my father and we knew that the Allied troops were getting ready to land. Remember, this is May, and my family went out uh May 19 you see. D Day was June 6th, so while they were at the citadel, I was busy making arrangements to send packages. We made arrangements to get letter s in, packages meaning if you read one of the letters that was sent out of the citadel, they 're asking for canned meat, anything that can be preserved. They're asking for shoes. She's asking for for candy...we call them bon bons...for the for the child. Uh she's asking for thread. She's asking for a bra. So during...from March 5 to May 12th was it...I was busy with that you see. I was with Monsieuer Madame LeBare in a...oh no, I was not with Monsieur Madame LeBare the w hole time. When I left where I was a maid, I don't know how...I ended up...I forgot about th at...in the home of a law...oh, probably through their daughter who was married to a lawyer. I was in Liege. I remember...she lived along the river and I ended up in the home of a lawyer, a single woman who had never been married. She smoked a pipe. She had a boy friend. I didn't expect...understand the extent of it. You know, I was very naive. Remember from the age of fi fteen to the age of eight een, I didn't have normal growing-up. Yes. I was in the home of a lawy er, and I remember baking bread and I remember cleaning the house, but she was not...I was not the maid maid that I was before and I was arranging to make packages to send to the citade l and I was arranging to keep my father in jail, and she's the one I says you get my father rele ased...I'll kill you. I was not eighteen years old, and I turned to the lawyer, the son-in-law of the home where I was hiding who was very nice, you see, and he arranged when my father came up fo r trial to keep him in jail, because my father was ready to surrender himself to the Germans. I forgot about that part. I stayed with her for short time, so I don't think I had time to be sc ared. I didn't have time for anything. I don't think...my father had the brunt in trying to pay someone to get the family released from the citadel and when I went to Brussels, I didn't know about the gas chambers. I knew they were deported. I know I went to pieces. I...I was going on eighteen but it was my mother who went. I remember crying and I remember saying no, I don't want to go to the movie. I remember distinctly, and I lived the last three months...we each had, each of us three girls had in the padding of our coat my aunt in Cleveland, her na me and address. She was the only relative we had outside of Europe except an uncle who was on a kibbutz in Israel. We had her address and two hundred American dollars. Remember, this is black market, so that if we got separated the two hundred dollars helped me survive financ ially. Remember no body had money. No body had a lot. Monsieur Friedman...w e won't go into this character. He was a character. Took the two hundred dollars and sold them to an American, sold to a German soldier when...remember the Germans were walk...I mean clean. Nothing, not a pin was out of line when they walked. When the Allied troops crossed the French-Belgi um border, the radio was saying they were crossing the Belgium, the French-Belgium border. The news could not keep up with the Allied troops. They were in Brussels. I could see th e Allied troops coming. I ha d been released from the hospital. My appendics were...had opened and there was uh uh...I had an infection and there was no bandages and I had a gauze bandage around me, and they came and everybody was 19 kissing them. They wanted to pick me up a nd I was afraid the suture was going to open (laughter) and the Allied troops came in and I saw for the first time German soldiers...you know, this ____ with the jacket, and I remember one distinctly. Remember, I'm going on eighteen and I'm seventeen...dragging a horse. They were selling, they were trying to get American dollars. They were trying to get anything they could la y their hands on because the German mark, the Belgium money was worth, was worth absolutely nothing, so my two hundred American dollars, I never saw it because he kept...he kept it. We so ld to uh German soldiers on the black market. It would have brought in a fortune probably. That I remember distinctly. I remember getting on the train and I remember it was dusk and and I couldn't go anywhere else, because I wanted to get back with my father. Whethe r the thought of the state of my mother and sisters came into in my mind at that time...I don't think so. What I can recall distinctly is saying I want to be with my father. I want to be home for my eighteenth birt hday. That I remember. Whether I thought or I wondered what happened to my mother...at the tim e maybe I didn't. My main aim was getting back with my father, which I didn't do right aw ay because I stayed with Monsieur Madame LeBare. When I got to ___ there was no transpor tation. I got on an American jeep. Took me into Liege. Then I worked on getting my fath er, getting, you know, my fath er out of jail. He was an alien. They were going to send him a nd at the time there was already becoming Russia, that part of Czechoslovakia. I'm trying to think and I can't...di d I wonder what happened to my mother and sisters as the Jews came out of the concentration cam ps. I guess we were hoping to see them come out, because they went out ve ry soon before D-Day, but because see they deported them once more even after D-Day. This is June 6th they landed. They didn't come into Belgium until September, so we called them ______. One group of Jews went out and there was another one I understand went out after them. So we were hoping as Jews came out of the concentration camps...Rochelle came out. She does not remember...I saw her in Israel...that I went to see her after she came home, but she didn 't talk about what happened. I remember her crying, but I went to see her because when I saw he r in Israel about eleven years ago, I said to her, I said Rochelle, don't you remember I saw yo u, and she said no, but I remember. Cause she told me at the time she was sterilized, that sh e, you know, she was not...Mengeler sterilized her, because when I was in Israel...that was before they announced that Mengeler had died, whether it's sure enough beside the point (ph), and she said to me, she says I could...in French, of course...if I could lay my hands on Mengeler, and she told me the process of her being sterilized. Today, at the time, could be reversed. She remarried, but she cannot ha ve children. She could not, you know, she could not have children. And what I remember at liberation is when the Jews came back, this whole thing...we were hoping my mo ther would come back, you see. And then at first, you know, they were released quite easily and then they were detained to rebuild their health and, you know, they were cleaned up and that's when they straggle in and somebody told my father, you know, people survived and it was a Belgium from Liege, who had been deported earlier...I don't know at which poi nt...he said to my father, don't keep hoping. I took them out myself out of the gas chambers. And my aunt by marriage who is the only one left in Belgium now, when I went back she made me aware, and th is has always been hard for me to swallow, but this was the time when he ran out of gas, and the people were not completely dead before they went into the the ovens, a nd that has been a very, very hard thing for me. At first I told myself, oh they weren't tortured. They were not used for experiments, and I thought of them of going into the gas chambers a nd being killed right away, you know. They put peo...prisoners and they electrocute them, and I guess this is what I wanted to believe is they went in, until Rochelle just sent me her letter and said they were in very bad...you know, they were on trains, 20 you know, for two days from the 19th to the 21st. I lived with that because I made myself believe that they went in...they went into the gas chambers and we nt out right away, but that is not so because they were not...that's when people did not go out completely because he was exterminating too fast and there was not enough gas before they put them in the crematories, and when this was pointed out to me...I I tried to put in the back of my mind. Then when I came to the States to live with my aunt, I came in May and in the fall...I don't remember what month...we had high holy days and my aunt wanted to go to ____ for my mother and I absolutely refused and I said oh no. I'...I remember. I say if I go to ____ for my mother, I'll bury her. And I did not want to go for that reason. I mean it's childish. It's unrealistic, but I remember saying to her no. I'll bury my mother. And I would not go to ____ _. And it took me a long time I think because I was told that my sister had a choice of goi ng with wom...with the wom...in the women's camp and to my mother. I think to myself, you know , she was old enough to remember her name. She...I mean I was...when she went out she was si xteen in June, June 20 or 21st. She was old en...for many many years after hopi ng oh, she got lost someplace on the Russian side and she couldn't get out and maybe someday...and this is so mething that I must admit even to this day even though I know, I know, I know...there is a trace in me and I've never said this to my son...there's a trace in me that keeps telling me she's alive someplace. (Crying) I don't know why and I know it isn't so...but I didn't want to bury my mother. For many many years I did not want to go to ______, and I know my sister is gone, but I think it's something in you that keeps that little bit of hope, that little bit of twinge and you know, everybody had parents. Everybody had sisters. Everybody had brothers. Now we are slowly entering an age, you know...parents have died off and I realize that parents do die, and I think this has helped me to accept...and children loose parents at an early age because of illness, and as I get older and I have very, very close friends in Cleveland...they're family to me...whos e mother and father have died, you know, from age. I think if the word accept is the right word, I'm learning to live with it because we do die, but at eighteen I didn't want to accept it, you see. And I think it's a littl e bit easier for me to accept and it's been many years th at my mother died, because I've seen my friends loosing their mother and father. I happen to have friends whose parents lived for a long time, you know, until eighty, eighty\u00a9two, and they just lost them a fe w years ago. One of them just lost them two years ago, so it does happen, so maybe it's made it more acceptable to me that my mother died. My sisters...I don't know. When a friend of mine died because of illness, so I'm slowly entering the age, you know, illness and things. You know, I had a hard time adjusting to the high holy days, uh especially Rosh Hashanna and Yom Kip pur...not so much Passover, but Rosh Hashanna and Yom Kippur. There's the family tie that I don't go to pieces anymore. I haven't had any nightmares or screaming for my father and fi re burning in a long time I don't think. Uh it uh...you know, time heals. My sister is nowhere. I mean there's no two ways about it. I cannot, you know, kid myself and I've accepted that my mother is gone, and I try not to talk about it, to remember or to to face the realit y. It's silly...that there was not enough gas to kill them and then since Rochelle wrote to me, you know, I...when I see movies with the trains I can't look at them. I went to Yad Vashem. I'm always afraid to s ee pictures. Running away from rea...reality. When they have real pictures, I'm always afraid to look and to see them. I'm afraid to look at train pictures, you see. I'm always afraid to see my mother or my sisters, which is foolish because it's the real thing, and I can watch movies . I can watch...I can talk about it. When I see it, then I see them and this is...this is the pa rt that I don't like to see is, you know, when they show those skeletal-like people. I know this did not happen to my mother and sisters because they went to the gas chamber right away you see. But I cannot watch the the trains. See my 21 little sister was fourteen in March, but she was very small, so you see the children. My little cousin...we were very close to him because he had lost his real mother and he was in our house a lot, but I don't think I feel the tie with him as much as with my sisters, and with Rochelle, the little boy...I mean this kid, this th is baby didn't sit on a chair. I mean he had all the adults pampering him and spoiling him, so until I get...I don't think I have fully accepted that there was not enough ___ and they were dragged out half-alive. I don't know. I tell myself maybe they didn't, and I cannot, and I cannot see the trains. I cannot watch it. The rest I can accept and I always say to the Americans, you came two months too late as far as I'm concerned. You know, my son is an American. I consider myself fully Americanized. All my friends are American. I never affiliated with people who came from Eur ope because Belgium is very different. I was one of the first...I was not a deportee and I came, I landed in New York exactly...._____ year after D-Day. I was really fortunate that I met gi rls my age. Whether they felt sorry because I didn't speak English very well. I Americanized but I always say you came too late, two months too late, and they bombed supposedly the railro ad and they missed because had the railroads been damaged enough, the trains couldn't have gone out you see. So I had...oh is it resentment, towards the Allied troops. You know, I'm an adult now and I realize that especially with what goes on now you can't ______ all the time, but I reme mber the evenings and we waited and we waited and we hoped for the Allied troops to come and we waited and we hoped and I think that's what kept us going. And that's what...because I remember talking about it. My parents talked about it. We talked about it. We just waited. We talked about the Allied troops coming, and they came June 6th and they went out May 19th. You see how close. But they did not land in Belgium until September...until Septem...the early part of September, because I went home for my birthday September 14. So this...I think this is what kept us going in hiding. The feeling, the fear was only when you heard sabotage went on. Not even when we were in the country but in Liege...you didn't know who they we re going to arrest. You didn't know who they were going to put in the citadel to torture, and we had these Catholics, these wonderful people who would have done anything to to to help us, you see. Papers were made out, I mean to such an extent that my father got called to go to Germany and then the the the mayor of the village said we made a mistake on his age, and they made him ten year s older, you see. Uh people who found a place for me to go as a maid. When my sister t ook over, found the orphanage. Now let me tell you that when they went to the orphanage, my pare nts had to pay for it. The orphanages, the _____, the Catholic did not take you in unless it was paid. Remember these people are on donations, on income. They did not take them unless you had the means to pay for their support, and as it is, you know, they were rationed also, you know, so you...it was not an easy thing. But that you had to pay for. Our papers, our hou...we we paid the rent on the house, OK. But it was minimal because there was no electricity. There was no water. There was nothing, but the people who got us the house didn't ask for anything. The people made contact in us for anything. The people...this man who made the th e the false ID papers did not get paid. The people who made the contacts for us did not get paid. Everythi ng was done to help us as Jews without any financial reward. The LeBare got jewelry. Li ke I say, they were gold rings. We had British coins also in gold that we sold for money to survive. All of that was brought...anybody could have taken...it was brought for free, for no no rewa rd, nothing, and these people have never even been recognized realize. When I went to Ya d Vashem I saw they had names, and I thought oh, my didn't I do that, but I don't know to what extent they consider somebody helping the Jews, you know, to recognize and put their name ther e. I don't...maybe Rochelle put their name there, because there would have been cost making out the...and I mean the papers were made but 22 if they took our identification papers when we went to the registr y, we were registered in the...we were real, you see. My little sister didn't need a card. My cousin didn't need a card. You had to have them at age...was it fifteen we got the...eve n a Belgium citizen had to register and carry an identification card."

The war brides were coming in and I remember it was a Saturday. The travel agent came. I was at my friend's house, and he says I have passage for you. And overnight I had to prepare to come. I s till have the suitcase I came and hard papier mache (ph)...remember this is post-war.
