And my Hebrew name was Wiscolar (ph). My parents ca me -- both of them from religious homes, and while they were not Orthodox, they still kept very much the tradition, what you would call strong conservatives nowadays. And shortly or a couple of years af ter my birth, I a ssume my parents moved to a city that today is Romania called Kolozsv\u00e1r or Cluj."

Came to vi sit Grandma and Grandpa, a nd I had uncles and aunts there and spent wonderful times with them. Very pampered, very loved. It was very, very warm house. I remember my grandfather picking me up. They had this chandelier that hanging with little beads at the end, almost like a little skirt. And he used to pick me up so I can touch it and play with it. And I had really a lot of fond memories just remembering the furniture and remembering the smells of the kitchen an d sitting around the table and eating and roaming around in the courtyard and playing outside. All of those memories ar e really kind of in my mind, very wonderful memories of visitin g my grandparents."

There were just the two of us, and because he was seven and a half years older, he had different interests. And aside from trying to pester me because he enjoyed seeing me scream ing or laughing or whatev er it was, really our relationship was like a younger sibl ing looking up to almost an adu lt. He was -- I almost always admired him, and I was in awe of him. He was -- the age differences were so great until we grew up to be adults. In adulthood, now that we are both adults, I cons ider him my younger brother. Because it turned out that I think I'm the more mature one and he's the softer one. So it's amazing how the roles switch later on in life. 01:04:44"

There were -- actually, there were 15 children born to that family, and 13 of them grew up to adulthood. And they were of very modest m eans. My mother came from a much more prosperous background, but at the time of their marriage already times ch anged for the worse. And my grandparents didn't have what they had before , and so they had very little. My parents got married and for a while, they had a bakery. And then that fizzled away, and th at's when they moved ba ck to my grandparents' town, to Debrecen, where I was bo rn. And from there, they pick ed up, and they went to Cluj because there was work in Cluj. And it turns out that my father in Cluj was just a laborer. They really lived in a very modest, modest life. They didn't have much, and my mother knitted a lot. And I don't know if she sold some of her knittings or not, but really at that time financially they were considered poor."

            "answer": "In the courtyard where we lived, it was kind of an apartment building that the front to the street, was a few stories high. But in th e courtyard itself there was like what you would call a townhouse, one-level townhouses today, the a ttached homes. And it kind of surro unded, went like an L-shape. And we lived in one of those houses . Now, we had neighbors, most of them were Jewish neighbors. But we also had the manager of this courtyard, the manager of that apartm ent building who took care of the grounds and took care of the property, a nd he was not Jewish. We were very friendly. I remember playing with the children. I remember them putting up the Christmas tree and me helping hang up the walnuts on the branches of th e tree. So the parents were very friendly. We lived in a community where, of course, there were quite a fe w Jewish families. Not Orthodox Jewish families, but mode rn Jewish families. 01:08:02 And yet, my parents were always ve ry Zionistic, and they definitely saw to it that in sp ite of the fact that they didn't have a lot of money, so to speak, th ey raised us in a Jewish school. What would be like a Jewish day school today. My brother went to the Hebrew Gymnasium in Kolozsv\u00e1r, and I was in the kindergarten that belong ed to that school. And so he was already in the upper grades, and I was -- just before we were taken away, I was about to start firs t grade. In the kindergarten, of course, we learned about all the holidays and little Hebrew songs and Hung arian songs and dances and they read us stories. And everything that at that time they taught in a kindergarten. And I went to that kindergarten -- in the school, the children have to wear uniforms. So the uniforms were always navy and a white shirt. A navy uniform and a white shirt. That was the uniform for the 4 Hebrew Gymnasium. The boys have to wear hats. And I think ther e was Star of David on the hat, if I'm not wrong. But even if it wasn't, by the time it approached 1943, everybody had to wear the Jewish star, no matter what, on the street. You could not walk out to the street without having the Jewish star sewn on your coat or sewn on your ja cket or on your dress, depending on the season of the year. You really had to wear it like a badge on your chest."

            "question": "Were you aware of any attack s, verbal or physical, on your family or on your brother or yourself?",
            "answer": "Only on my brother. I was not much aware of anything that was going on outside. I only was aware of the fact that I was tota lly forbidden to leave the courtyard where we lived. And I was always warned if I every set foot out of the courtyard, to make sure that I have on me something that has the Jewish star on it. Of course, being so yo ung, my mother did not look forward to me setting out my foot outside the courtyar d, no matter what. And that's un derstandable, but that was so impressed on me as a young child that I was really scared to step outside. And I liked to step outside, because when I stepped outside the courty ard in the basement of the building next door there was a candle factory. And I remember lo oking down there, I was fa scinated how they made the candles. How they dipped it in wax with the wicks, you k now, up and down going into the melted wax. And I was just fascin ated by the whole process. So I looked to sit outside, you know, kind of stoop down and watch ho w they were doing those things, but I was really carefully monitored. I remember my brot her coming home from school, an d there was always an upheaval because he was chastised going to school, chastised coming back from school; he was taunted. And I must say, I had a very handsome brother that was not even -- initially was very handsome and the uniform looked great. But there were always -- harangued going to school and coming back from school and fist fights would ensue coming home. And also then in those days, people still rode in buggies and carriages and some bu ses and various transportation. So the kids really walked to school and came back from school . Nobody had cars, so nobody picked the children up. So it was a natural thing for him to walk to school and come back. And my father was a very ethical and moral man, but to some extent I think was very naive. 5 01:12:06 And he felt that it's unbecoming a Je wish young man to fist fight. Th at this is not something that -- he didn't teach us that, and this against anything th at we stand for. And that either you reason or you talk, but you don't fist fight. Y ou are not a hooligan. If you fist fight, then you reduce yourself to the gutter level. And my brother came home one day, and he had somebody's footprint on his navy uniform. Obviously, somebody kick ed him in his behind. And my father got so angry at my brother, and my brother was a very mild-mannered young man. But I guess there was just so much taunting that he could take and there on the way, and somebody physically attacked him. And somebody kicked him in hi s behind. And I think my father added his own hand to teach him not to get into brawls on the street, unfortunately. S o, But I remember my brot her who was very good at woodwork; he was very artistic young man. He pain ts and he sculpts and he does woodwork. He's an extremely talented young -- he was an extremely talented yo ung -- now, he's an extremely talented young adult, older adult. I call him young adult, I should r eally call him older adult. And I remember him fash ioning with -- from little wood, you know, handle and attaching a whip to it that was rolled in his hand. That was his protection going to school, so if somebody attacks him, he can whip this out. And that kind of left a very strong impression on me as a child. That and the fact that my father hit him."

I think the lessons -- I think the lessons were in spite of all difficulties and in sp ite the horrendous times, they did not hide who they were. They kept very strong ly the Jewish holidays. 6 01:15:08 They made sure that my brother became bar mitzva hed at such a difficult time. I remember my brother's bar mitzvah in the big temple; it was al most empty. And I remember standing in the Orthodox synagogues in those days, the women sat on top on the second level and looked down. And the men were downstairs. I remember standing between the railing and watching my brother chanting from his Haftorah. And no matter what, Passover was Pass over; Rosh Hashanah was Rosh Hashanah; the Sabbath was the Sabbath. All of those traditions were kept to the bitter end. Nothing was really hidden away, and I think it gave me a sense of understa nding and a sense of also some pride. I was not hidden way, all of those things we re not hidden away from us. If anything else, it just made me stronger probably an d more believing. That you just cannot allow anybody to trample over you."

            "question": "How much was your regular life, as you knew it, disrupted at that point in Hungary? It wasn't physically occupied by the Germans. How much did life change? Were ther e a lot of restrictions?",
            "answer": "There were restrictions on what -- between what hour and what ho ur you were allowed to go out on the street. Jews were not allowed on the street at every hour, every day of the -- every hour of the day. There were restrictions in terms of how often you were allowed -- between what hour and what hour you are allowed out on the street. I'm sure it was very disruptive to my parents, to my mother. My father, who was still working at the time, and then later on in '43 was taken to a forced labor camp. My mother being alone with two young children. School s ceased to exist. We were not allowed to go to school. The Jewish school closed, and so we were primarily at home. My brother was very busy. Him and neighbors, they dug up a bunker in the front, in the courtyard, because there were a lot of sirens and a lot of runn ing to the shelter. 01:18:07 7 And the shelter was really not belo w ground level. It was like a la undry room type of a thing, where people washed. And that was the shelter. And I remember that that affected me something fierce as a child. I was hysterical every ti me the siren sounded. I used to cry and scream. I was just so utterly shaken and afraid as a child from all these soun ds. And that affected me later on in life, too. Because for a long time when at th at point was silent and not screamin g, but when we came to Israel and the sirens were going on b ecause of the War of Independenc e, and there was never really complete peace. There was always that panic of will I make it to the shelter or won't I make it to the shelter? That always ensued, and at times it woul d just be a siren over an ambulance that sounded like a siren. But once you hear it, it's like it shakes you up completely. So . . ."

            "answer": "I don't remember that any of this was discu ssed with me. I think my parents probably spoke between themselves, or they spoke to my brother, but none of this was shared with me. I was -- they felt probably that I was too young. And I'm sure those di scussions took place between my brother and my mother, especially after my father was taken away to labor camp. He was the man in the house, and my mother kind of gave him instructions in case -- the fear was already there that we will be taken away. We will forc ed out of our house. Th at we will be forced to leave. Where? Nobody knew. 01:21:01 8 But my mother felt at the time that she needs to prep are my brother, because if she's out in the street and something happens, then she gave him inst ructions how to dress me, how many layers of clothing to put on me. I know that there was knapsack for each one of us prepared on the side to take with us, the necessities, chan ges of a few pieces of clothing, and eating utensils made out of something unbreakable. You know , one of those enamel dishes, and the eating utensils that we have to eat with and things like that were in the knapsack. And my mother put in -- I had a little baby umbrella. It was just like a little umbrella with pink roses on it, and she put that in the knapsack, too. It was my favorite little toy or wh atever, and she put that in. And as she feared, that's exactly what happened. Be cause she was out in the street when they started rounding up all the Jews, and she had to beg for them to allow fo r her to come home beca use she had two children at home. She came back and all we did is pick up the knapsack s, and she took down the Mezuzah from the door. She threw away the casing; she just kept the co ntent, which was a leather parchment about this size. Very long. This is all. She took it with her. Already prio r to that, she flushed down her diamond in the toilet, because she felt she's not giving it to anyone but she didn't want it to be taken away from her. And on a nice April day, they came for us."

They just rounded up all the men, and this was forced labor camp. They were not compensated for it. They were not paid. They made them work, and they gave them minimum food and shelter. And my father was taken away in '43, and during that time he came home twice for a couple of hours, a couple of days . I don't recall. And that was it. 01:23:59 9 I remember him on e Passover sitting around the table in the kitchen and doing the traditional Seder and with the big, white pillow, and my father had some white coat on that was the tradition that the father of the household wore all white during Pass over. And then reading the Haggadah and doing this modest Seder, and the sirens started wailing. And at that time, already the bunker was dug up in the front yard in the courtyard, and all the neig hbors and us were running , we were running down there for shelter. That kind of stands up in my memory. I rememb er my father coming home one day, and I think that was when he came home from the one vacation that he had from a labor camp. And I remember him kind of spreading his arm out so that I should run to hi m. That's it."

And they were just as bad, an d just as dastardly, bastardly, whatever you want to call them. And they were just all too happy to help. There was no big qualms about it. They came, they rounded us up, they put us on cattle vans. You know, like a big van, moving van like you would see nowadays. Women, children, olde r people, they we re put up on the van. And I remember walking out of the little apartment -- a ll the apartment consisted of was a kitchen and a bedroom. That's it. And a little pantry. And I remember the door closing in and them boarding it up. Absolutely boarding it up so no one can enter. And we were taken away to a brick factory in Kolozsv\u00e1r. The courty ard of a brick factory, they put up little huts. Four sticks of wood with a little fabric and some -- I don't even know what was on top. 01:27:00 And those were the living condition s for the next month for all of these people, who for generations grew up in Hungary. Were born and raised and worked, and, of c ourse, we lived in those huts for a whole month. Minimal food was brought in. If it rained, it rained. If it was dry, it was dry. I 10 remember my mother opening the little umbrella that she stuck in my backpack, and that was what was kept over my head when it ra ined. It was just horrendous conditions. Horrendou s conditions to see people who -- I was in my little eyes, in my little girl's eyes, just to see the doubts in most of the women and children because most of the men were gone. Taken to the brickyard factory. We stayed there for a month, and from there we were taken to Budapest."

I just know that when we were in Budapest, and we stayed in Budapest for two weeks in a la rge school, we came away from Cluj, about 300 people, 300 Jewish people. That's children, wome n and some men. And we were taken away to Budapest, and in Bu dapest we were joined with ab out 1,500 other Hungarian Jewish families. I had an aunt in Buda pest who disguised herself as a Gentile. She was blonde, blue-eyed, and she was in one of Raoul Wallenberg's safe houses. 01:30:16 She knew where my father was in labor camp. She smuggled some bread to him, and then we arrived at Budapest. And those arrived, I guess, my father learned that we ar e there.

That this group was gathered together, and they collected everybody's belongings and money and jewelry and whatever everybody could offer, because the Germans needed trucks. 01:36:08 13 And Kastner, who was a lawyer , a Hungarian Jewish lawyer, de alt with Eichmann and pleaded with him to save this group of Jews to show to the world that what they are doing is not -- supposedly not happening. And be cause it was towards the end of the war, they were in such terrible need of money that they had accepted it. And this group supposedly was supposed to be transported to Turkey. But instead fr om Budapest in cattle cars, they took us to Bergen-Belsen."

            "question": "Do you know how you became a part of this group?",
            "answer": "Probably because twofold. First, my parents were always Zionists, and they were always active in the Zionist movement. Second, my uncle who was with us, he was a very important banker in Kolozsv\u00e1r. He was wealthy, and he was well-todo. And he had more connections, and he put us on the list, together with his family. And I think th at was probably one of th e most importa nt things. But in this group, as I said before, not everyone had a connection, and not everyone was wealthy, it may seem. There was a good percentage of them who had the money, but they brought together with them 500 orphan children w ho did not have anybody to speak for them. And so there were many other people in the group, not just those who were privileged to be in the group. And in those days also, there were many moveme nts. There were many organizations, Jewish orga nizations, that tried to save Jews in every which way they could. And like between all people, there are always differences of opinion. There were those who fe lt you should not deal with Nazis. There were those who felt you should do whatever you can to save the Jews. There were those who felt that just something bad will come out of it. There were thos e who felt that this is not the way to go. So even if they knew and they could go on with the group, they did not want to. It was a life that was unknown. Just like Kastne r thought that we will all wind up in Turkey, and we wound up in concentration camps instead . And he himself, I think, put hi s life on the line every minute of the day when he entered this negotiations and traveled as a Jew all over the country for meetings and different things. His life was on the line constantly. His family wa s just in as much jeopardy as anybody else. 14 01:39:04 And, you know, people claim he should have told ev erybody what's going on. He should have let the Hungarian Jewry know what's going on. The documentation s hows that there are some people that escaped concentration camps who came ba ck, and who reported what's going on, who told them what's going on. And nobody would believe them. Nobody wo uld listen. It's easy to be a good judge, you know, after the fact."

            "answer": "I have the feeling by the time th ey were hoarded into the cattle cars, that they feared the worst. I don't know what they thought really, because I was so young at the time that even if the conversation was going on around me , I think my mind was working in a different direction. Either in denial of what was going on , or my mind went through imagin ation, you know, what a child imagines or plays in their head. It's very hard to te ll; I don't recall back that fa r as to what I had. On top of it, during this journey I came down with Ge rman measles, so I was one sick child by the time I arrived to Bergen-Belsen. And my mother wrapped me up in a blanket that she had for me, a little pink and white blanket. And she ca rried me with that blanket; I wa s very small, luckily. Not that my mother was tall, believe me. But I was a small child, an d she picked me up in her arms and covered me totally with a blanket. And by the time we got to th e gate and there was a walking, marching from the train to the ga tes of hell of Bergen-Belsen, and I remember -- I don't remember. This is just stories that I remember that my mother was te lling me. That they asked her if I am sick, and she said, \"No, the child is only sleeping.\" Th ey couldn't gauge how old I was, because I was small. Being totally covered, they couldn't gauge my age. And at that point as soon as we arrived to Bergen-Belsen, they separated the boys and the men from the women a nd the girls. So my brother was separated from us at th at point, and he was taken -- he wa s 14 years old at that time. He was separated, he was with my uncle and his cousi n. And I was with my mo ther and my aunt and my cousin, two aunts and a cousin. We were in these huge barracks with the wooden beds. 01:44:02 Everybody sleeping next to everyb ody on a wooden slat, and barbed wires all over the place. No sooner did we arrive, I think we needed to march out of the ba rracks to be counted. And this counting went on day, noon and night . They were very meticulous, they constantly counted. I don't 16 know why it was so important for them, but I guess they wanted to make sure that no one is missing. And the war went on."

            "question": "Do you remember what the conditions of life were like there?",
            "answer": "The conditions of life were ho rrendous. I remember as a child they had what you see today, an outhouse. You know, how you have an outhouse and there is like a hole and everything goes in the hole? I remember like a semicircle, and these holes were there in the ground without any separation. Without any doors, without any privacy. Just like animals. And for some reason, I recall being there. It is so horrendous. I was brought up in such a modest way. My parents were such modest people, and I had never seen adults sitting on a toilet or doing their thing. And I remember somebody either bending down and his glasses fell off their eyes. I remember those glasses falling into the hole. An d, you know, that was the end of it. Now, you know, in any person who -- this kind of stuck in my mind. And just understanding of what it means for someone who does not see to wear glasses and to lose them. And my mother glasses since she was a little child, so I know that this -- I know that she cannot -- she cannot exist wi thout her glasses, you know. So that thought left such an impres sion on me. And the other big im pression was when we were taken to the showers. We were taken to the showers, and if you can imag ine a fence that is made out of wooden slats that are very tightly attached to each ot her. We were walkin g by this fence, and people were screaming. And I remember asking my mother, \"Why are they screaming?\" My mother said to me, \"Because they recognize names that were writte n on the fence.\" Now, nobody 17 had pens or pencils with them, but people bent down and picked up a piec e of rock or chalky substance that was on the ground. And they smeared their names in the fence. Or wrote down dates when they were there, in case somebody else will come and recognize them. It's that feeling or maybe that faith that knowing that you may be going to your death, that maybe somebody else will come and recognize your name. Because the entire fence was scribbled with names, and people obviously recognized some names on those fences. Or they didn' t recognize, maybe they thought they did. You never know what went on in people's minds, but th e fear was tremendous. And we were taken into the showers where everybody had to get undressed. And I remember the horror for the first time in my life , that I have seen adults naked. I didn't even see children naked. I don't remember if I saw myself naked. I was just a little girl, and now I see children and mothers and grandmothers marching around naked into these show ers. And people were screaming because they obviously did not think that those were showered. Obviously felt th at this is the end of them, but we were showered. And we came out of it, which is so unbelievable that -- that that impression, that horrendous thing, it stays like a pict ure in your mind foreve r. And then we we re taken back. And the other, of course, the counting that I already told you about, th at they marched us out from the barracks constantly to stand in lines and count us, stand in rows. 01:50:01 And the other horrendous impressi on was when they came with th eir leather boots and the German Shepherds with them. And bringi ng the food, which always looked to me like some kind of a dishwater with something floating in it that looked like some burgundy sausage or something. Something disgusting looking in it. That was the food , and a little bit of bread. I don't know, I really honestly I don't know how we survived. I really do not know how we survived. How we survived the hunger, how we survived the conditions. It's like it's hard, it's am azing. I remember also being marched out of Bergen-Belsen about eight months after being there."

In my child's eye, I thought that we had a rrived to the biggest palace, al most like in a dream. And I remember coming there, and the ch ildren were given toys by the Red Cross and being fed and being taken care of. And the name of the place was called Hotel Esplanade. And very shortly after arriving and probably being checked physically and medically and chec king for lice and checking to see if everybody who needs medical attention and so forth, very shortly afterwards, they took all the children away. And we were brought to a -- up in the Alps, you know, like in to like a farm area for recuperation. And just to get us a little bit healthier after all the ordeal of being in concentration camp for so long. At this point the Red Cross wa s there to help. The Schlakim (ph) , which are messengers from Israel, from Palestine at the time came to our aid. They were working very hard on receiving the proper certificates to enter Palestine, because we could not en ter freely. And some semblance of normal life wa nted to return. Now, that's what th ey wanted to achieve. So they took us into a -- as I said, it was probably like a farm. Almost like a kibbutz kind of a thing on the Alps. And they started process, they star ted to try to teach us according to the level that we were at, what we were supposed to start. An d I don't even remember -- proba bly they tried to teach us in Hungarian, if I' m not wrong. 01:04:02 22 Now, in Switzerland we all learned a little bit of Ge rman because that was the spoken language in that area of the country. And each and one of us kind of picked up some German language. I remember sitting in the classroom, it was very frightening to me to some extent because here I was away from my mother. My mother was left in th is big hotel with a lot of other women who were widowed, and all the children in all ages were gathered together. And teachers were brought from all over to try to teach us, and they tried to conduct classes. And I just remember me sitting in the classroom and totally gazing and no t comprehending anything. It wa s like in a dream, I remember sitting there saying to myself that \"This is school,\" but my mind was totally on other things. I could not concentrate. I don't remember that -- I can't recall if I learne d anything. I pr obably remember just learning just a little bit of the ABCs, the letteri ng, the beginning of learni ng how to read. But to tell you that this was a formal sc hooling that I could recall or I can retain anything, probably very little because of the emotional upheav al that probably I felt as a child. The one thing for sure that none of us got was psychological c ounseling. That was not in anybo dy's agenda or even in their -- in anybody's thought that that was needed at the time. I reme mber the older children putting up a play of David and Goliath. I reme mber my brother playing the role of Goliath if I'm -- of David. And -- but I don't remember anything else from area , just the fact that th ere was a lot of cheese, which I hated. There was a lot of milk, which I didn't like to drink. Most people were so happy so see cheese. As a child, these were things that I di d not like to eat. I did not like cheese, and I didn't like hard-boiled eggs, you know. I used to choke on them. There are memories of things that I really could not -- I guess I could not tolerate them. 02:07:02 And other than that, really the time in Switzer land passed by, and before we knew it -- I also remember something that really st ayed with me, is the fact that the Swiss people did not look upon us kindly. They were not friendly. They really did not like foreigne rs, and they -- I'm sure that this 23 was very hard for them to get this many refugees in one of their hotels. And from there we were taken away. I don't know what mode of transporta tion, in all honesty. Probably by train again to Bari, Italy, and from Bari, Italy we were taken by a boat to Israel."

In every classroo m that there is the girl who is the queen and it's amazing. I re member being afraid of some of the kids because they were so demanding and being afraid emotionally from them. I was a very sensitiv e child. Interestingly enough, I grew in to be quite a strong adult, and even as a youngster life kind of prepared me to become quite a strong individual. But I remember the sensitivity of being easily hurt. I had a lot of worries for a six-year-old child. I had to worry that I'm alone. I had to worry that somebody will demand things of me that I won't be able to give. 02:10:02 I had to worry about my safety. I had to worry a bout my existence. I ha d to worry where are we going? Where is going to be home? I had to worry if my father will come back. A lot of those things are constantly on my mind, and school was the farthest thin g from my mind. I was really more concerned of how to survive in this kind of a jungle. I'm sure they prepared us. As I said, they had put up a play of David and Goliath, so obviously the themes of tradition and the themes of 24 Israel and the themes of the Bible were brought back together. And don' t forget a lot of these children have studied already in Hungary, and a lot of them went to the Hebrew Gymnasiums or went to other Hebrew schools. They had backgrounds. My brother knew ho w to speak Hebrew already. Not fluently, but he stud ied Hebrew. So he knew how to read and he knew how to write and he knew how to speak. I didn't know one word at that point. I was too young. I didn't have that in my background yet."

It was definitely 1,000 percent improvement over Be rgen-Belsen, and it to ok me many, many ye ars to go back to Switzerland. 02:19:04 And I visited with my husb and Switzerland, and we we re in Montreuil, I said to him, \"I think the hotel is supposed to be in this area.\" And I said, \"I wonder if this hotel still exists, and if it exists, is it big or is it small?\" Because, you know, when you look as a child, some thing looks humongous and you don't remember. Well, I cal led my brother in Israel and as ked him, and he said, \"Yes, in 27 K\u00f6ln (ph) above Montreuil is Hotel Esplanade. It still exists. You go out there.\" Well, we took the train, which is like a Venicula (ph), it's almost like a mount ain-climbing train. And I cannot tell you -- I just sat there and cried. I can't explain the emotions. I didn't way one word, but as the train climbed higher and higher, the tears just rolled down my eyes. And when I got to the hotel, when we finally got there, indeed, the hotel was a huge hotel. A very el aborate hotel, it's not a wonder that in my eyes it looked like a palace. Because, as it turns out, the lady who greeted us at the place, she said, \"This hotel was once upon a time the winter playground for all the royalties of Europe. They used to come here for i ce skating and for skiing and for all sports activities, winter sport activities.\" And this was really like a palace. And she showed us a movie about the history of the hotel. She says, \"You are not the only refugees. There are many of them wh o have come back to visit through the years.\" It ceased to exist as a ho tel nowadays. Du ring the war they wanted to tear it down because nobody came to the hotel. And then they kept it as a refugee cente r. The refugees that were brought out of the war passed through this hotel. Now, they showed us this movie, and they showed also movies about a ll these royalties used to come and ice skate and ski over in this area. And after the war, after the refugees have left, again they wanted to tear down the hotel and they decided to keep it. And now they use it fo r an organization, a worldwide organization, for sane armament. These are people who ar e obviously pacifists who come there for conferences during the summer. 02:22:01 And they live very much like on a kibbutz, because they cook and they share in the cooking, washing the dishes, serving, taking care of the room s and so forth. Everybod y really shares in the upkeep. And I don't know for how long, for a month or two mont hs during the summertime, they keep it for conferences like that for sane armament . But, indeed, the hotel was a very elaborate, large, large hotel. So it wasn't just in my child's memory, but as an adult, it was quite interesting to see. 28"

I don't even remember how many days it took us to sail from Bari to Is rael, to Palestine at the time. But when arrived to Palestine, I remember getting off the boat, and we were given some nuts and I think an orange. My two hands filled up -- one orange filled up two hands. And I rememb er that my brother, my father's youngest brother, he was only living relative who lived in Is rael. He left to Pale stine when he was very young, and he was there from the age of 19. So he had went in the '30s to Palestine with his wife. And he was like the welcoming committee. But we were taken from there to Ac lite (ph) , which is a British concentration camp kind of thing, in Palestin e itself. In Aclite (ph) you were disinfected and checked for health, for this, for other reasons. And we were the first alia (ph) after the war to arrive to Palestine that had permits to enter.

Think of it, I was seven and a half years old, so I missed firs t grade; I missed second grade. And I just started first grad e. That was the first time that I remember going to school and starting to learn how to read and write. On top of it I arri ved to a kibbutz that no body spoke Hungarian. I spoke very little German, and I definitely did not speak Hebrew. So the communication was very difficult, but like all children, you quickly learn -- you quickly learn a new language when you are forced to learn it. But again, the communication with my mother and fath er was very difficult, because I didn't know how to read and write. I just started to learn how to read and write in Hebrew. My language skills could not have been great at that time. And like all first graders, you can imagine how well I wrote and how many spelling mistakes. My mother did not know how to read Hebrew, and I didn't -- I couldn't r ead her Hungarian le tters to me. 30 02:29:06 And nobody could read them to me either. So it was very difficult. My brother wrote to me in Hebrew, which I couldn't read eith er. But that could -- at least somebody could read it. So it's a little bit comical, but it was a quite difficult communication. And I didn't see my mother very often because the circumstances in Israel were so difficult at that time. These were the times of the uprising, this was pre-War of Inde pendence. Traveling was not easy. People traveled with armored vehicles, and they traveled only in caravans. You didn't see a car riding freely on the road, you were only safe if you traveled in caravans and in armore d vehicles. So really I think I saw my mother twice a year during this while period, and I was th ere for three years."

            "answer": "The kibbutz life was okay. I me an I'm sure it wasn't easy for me emotionally, but it was okay. There was a lot of -- I think I ca n attribute there was a lot of caring. I think we got something, somebody cared about us. I think we got that sense -- that sense did come th rough. I think going to school every day, and from very early young age they teach you to work a little bit to keep you busy, and to keep you a productive individual. It ke pt us very busy and very active and not allowing too much, you know, for day dreaming. And every child was assigned to a family. Unfortunately for me, I was assigned to the shoemaker in the kibbutz, who came from Pola nd who was a widower, and who had a daughter a year older than me. So I was not assigned to a family where there was a mother and a father. I was assigned to a family that there was only a father, and since he had a daughter who was a year older than me, he just didn't know how to be a parent for bo th of us. He was a good man, but, you know, if you have a choice between your own daughter and somebody's else's daughter, it's a big difference. So, but th at was the way it was. Bu t, generally speaking, I think there was lot of positive thin gs in the kibbutz. A lot of, you know, a lot of things that were taught that were very positive and very nice, and the holidays were always celebrated in a very nice manner. 31 02:32:01 This was not a religious kibbutz at all, but all the Biblical holidays were cele brated on -- in a freer way. That you felt -- I felt very much that I belo nged, so there was a lot of caring. I know I missed my mother, I know I fantasiz ed a lot. I fantasized a lot about my brother, and that is strange, that's even more. Because here he was already he went into the Navy, and I always worried whether he is going to get killed or is he going to be alive. And so my brother, again, loomed larger than life in my eyes in those days. And I sel dom saw him, very seldom. So re ally with the ex ception of living together in Hungary, we never agai n lived together in the same house."

My frie nds, the two brother and sister, they had a mother and they had each other. Then the children from Tehran came. These were children from Russia and from Poland, primarily Po lish children, who came without a soul. They lost their parents. They lost their siblings. They lost their uncles, their grandparents, everything in the war. They were sole survivors. So at that time, as much as one wanted to feel sorry for oneself, I think there was always somebody who was in a worse position than we were. And these children came with no one, and the kibbutz absorbed them into families. They became their families, literally."

I was very sensitive, very caring, and I think I also rationalized it was a very good way of protecting myself. I rationalized, so -- there are people that have less th an you, so it's okay. It wasn't the end of the 32 world. I think that's what kept my sanity, that I was able always to see ma ybe the better side of things instead of the worst side. 02:35:08 I just feel I was very fortunate as a child, because, in all honesty, wh en I think back that none of us ever, ever got any psychological counseling or help or group session or -- it wasn't even talked about. Everybody just went about their lives going on, it really didn't come back to haunt me until I had children of my own. I didn't realize the feelings that I stored inside until I had my own children. Because, you see, as I saw them gr owing up and I realized the ages, the circumstances, that's when I had a difficult time to reconcile with what I went through. Because you see your children, how vulnerable they are at such a young age and how needy they are, it's ve ry hard. On the other hand, it made me very strong. It made me able to slough off a lot of things and be able to face life."

So that happy occasion where ever ybody came out and they were dancing, and they brought out from the freezers the little appl es that they were saving for a special occasion, I don't know.

My mother just announced to me in a letter that she has remarried, she has gotten remarried and that they would like me to come home. 02:41:05 34 And it was good news and bad news for me. It was good news because finally I'm going to be with her. It was bad news to me because in my little mind I probably conjured up this image that if my mother is going to remarry, I have decided in advance that I'm going to hate this individual, and I will not -- he cannot replace my father. At that point my mother knew very well that my father is no longer alive. And she consulted w ith my brother, who was in the Navy, who was also closer. The Navy was in Haifa, so they saw each other quite frequently. An d she introduced the man that she was going to marry to my brother, and my brothe r was all for it. But nobody consulted me, and nobody introduced me. I was far away, I was not near Haifa. And so I was brou ght back to Haifa from the kibbutz, and I left the ki bbutz. And I came ba ck to Haifa, swearing to myself that I'm going to really hate this man and I'm not going to obe y him. This was what went on in mind at that time, but really in no ti me at all I realized what a nice in dividual she married. And he was a survivor also, who lost his wife and two children in the war. And his oldest daughter was my age, and she had my middle name, Suzanna h (ph) . And so he was quite a nice father to me; I think he loved me dearly. And that had a very good effect on my life. He was a good family man. He was extremely, extremely sensitive. But at the time that I came back to Haifa, I felt estranged from my mother. I mean she was important to me, but I no long er felt that need to be th at close. Or I think I had also a lot of anger in me pr obably that was never verbalized. But by the time I got back to Haifa, started school, and then things were done in very haphazard way. 02:44:10 I arrived to Haifa, I was at that time in the fourth grade. And they decide d since I was older -- and I was probably a fairly decent student. I wasn't a super student, but I was good, average student. They decided that oh, it's time to make up a grade. So I went for half a year in the fourth grade, and in the middle of the year, I transfe rred to the fifth grade. I think they would have done much better if they would skipped fourth grade altogether and put me in the fifth grade right in from the start, so 35 I will have an equal opportunity to start at the same level. But by the time I started fifth grade in the middle of the year, I was tota lly lost again. And this time they lost me from math forever, I was not a big mathematician. And I think from multiplying and dividing, I got into fractions. And I never learned the basics of how to de al with fractions in the beginni ng of the year, and I think it was extremely difficult. Extremely diff icult. I got into a very good grade. I got into a good grade in terms socially, it was very compatible and terrific. But academically , especially in math, I had a lot of difficulty that dragged on and o n. I always needed a private tuto r. Somehow I could never catch up to what I lost."

There was no middle school. So you went for eight years to elem entary and four years of high school. And when I finished elementary school, the eighth grade, it was by my mother's recommendation that I should maybe look into a technical high school, where I could l earn a profession and I can finish my high school diploma. At first I didn't want to hear about it, but then I decided that that's a very good idea. And I went and I looked at a school, and I liked it very much. It was very creative, and I was a very creative child. I guess I had a lot of creativity in me that I didn't even know that existed.

By the time I finished my high school diploma there, I had a profession also. And I went back for an extra year for a teacher's se minary, so that I became an arts and crafts teacher. And soon ther eafter, I got married. As soon as I finished really my teacher's seminary. Finished it in late June, and in August I got married of that year. 36"

But I will never feel on solid ground in this lifetime. I feel -- I don't dwell on it. I really don't dwell on it, beca use I like to dwell on the positive versus the negative. Even as a child, Pass over time, they used to all bring up everything that happened in the Holocaust. You know, they talk about the exit from Egypt and, you know, our forefathers coming out of Egypt. And they started in about what happened, how they rounded us up, how this one walked through Italy. The othe r one went to concentration camp. You know, everybody brought up their story, and it used to drive me crazy as a child. At that point, I said, \"We are already in Israel. We are already in freedom. Why do we have to talk about it?\" I realized why we had to talk about it, of course. And many time s I blamed myself because of that, that I didn't ask all the questions while my parents -- while they were alive. I didn't wa nt to deal with it, so I did not ask all the questions. 02:50:03 And really I was in Israel the other day, and I sat wi th my brother and my cousin who was with us in concentration camp, we we re discussing it. And everybody has just almost awakened to ask the questions, and nobody has parents anymore to ask th em from. While they we re alive, none of us wanted to deal with it. Okay? So, yes, you say you' re confident, and mayb e you pretend to be confident, I don't know. But I -- as I said, I dwell on the positive, and I think about, you know, in a positive way. But to say I'm on solid ground, I'm not afraid that tomorrow somebody's going to tell 37 me to pack up and move. But I will never say that it cannot happen again. There are times when we joke or we sit around and talk, and, say, in case of emergency -- I use it, in case of emergency, something disastrous would have happened to us. Let's see, what can we do? What are the skills that we have? What is it that we can do to survive? It's always in the back of my mind somewhere. God forbid that I should have to. I'm not looking forward to this."

I think there was something in Israel that I have to give a lot of credit to. There was something permeated in the air, in the atmosphere, in the surr ounding. I always felt safe in Israel when I was growing up, in spite of all the goings on. And I think what -- th ere was something permeating the air, and I think the message that I heard was we love the children. They are our future. 02:53:05 You are important. And I'm not ta lking me, physically, as an individu al, but rather all the children. The children were cherished, not just by their parents, but by the neighbors. By the people on the street. There was something healthy in the air. There was something health going on, in spite of the pain, in spite of everything else . In spite of the fact that th ere was no psychologi cal counseling and no group therapy and no this and no that. Maybe the group therap y was that they allowed us to grow up, to be children as much as possible. That you were in the youth movement. You were 38 encouraged to participate. We were encouraged to dance. We were encouraged to enjoy ourselves. There was something very healthy going on in the at mosphere that gave us some confidence, even if it was a false sense of confid ence by some, I don't know."

Had you by necessity developed your own kind of strength and independence, an d almost in self-defense, were you angry at your mother?",
            "answer": "Maybe my mother wasn't -- you know, it t ook me a long time to grow up, to realize, to understand the circumstances of her life were not easy. She wa s not the most communicative person. And there were instances, I think, especially one that I recall that I was greatly disappointed by her. She was supposed to come and visit me on a kibbutz, and there wa s only one bus a day that came with the caravans. And I was waiting and waiting for her, and she never showed up. And don't forget, there was no place to call. I mean there no telephones. There were no -- the grocer and some other -- the pharmacy had a telephone. Nobody had phones at home. So you c ouldn't pick up the phone and say, \"Dear, I am sorry I couldn't come. This and this happened.\" 02:56:03 So I had to wait for the mail to arrive as to why she didn't show up. Well, she didn't show up because she traveled from Haifa to Tel Aviv, and she had a few hours to kill. And she visited a friend, and she missed the bus . And I couldn't get over it. I couldn't get over it. I'm not sure that I have gotten over it, because obviously I still mention it. And my mother, may sh e rest in peace, 39 she's dead since '79. That kind of a thing, it re mained with me. That maybe I felt it was more important for her to visit her frie nd. I know it was not, and I'm sure that she was sorely disappointed that missed the bus. I can imagin e her feelings. But in those da ys, you just did not communicate and say, \"You have no idea how sorry I am or how upset I was, that I didn't -- and I'll make it up to you.\" Whatever. The facts were stated, and that was it. My mother didn't -- she was a sensitive person, but she didn't know how to communicate in a sensitive way. And so things like that and some other little episodes that caused, we had a good relationship with each other, but it wasn't a close, close warm relationship. I hear sometimes people talk about their mothers, how much they miss them and how much -- how cl ose they were. How devastated they were. Everything, you know, because their mother passed away. I was very hurt when she passed away. I loved her dearly. I wasn't devastated, I hurt for her. I hurt fo r the life that she had. I understand her. And in a way, I have forgiven for this or that little thing, you know. Our lives, the circumstances were horrendous. I would not have wanted to be the mother in those years. It was much easier to be a child. Much, much easier."

            "answer": "What that meant in those days , it's not the same thing. It's not something that you can even comprehend in terms of your dail y life today, because it wasn't the missing of the bus or the -- the pain that went with it was so overwhelming. Th e disappointment was so great, because you were a child alone in the kibbutz, and I pr obably have not seen my mother for six months. And she just did not show up. And it wasn't that she could come b ack with the next bus that will come the following day. Because she had on ly that weekend, she ha d to go back to Haifa because she was working. She was alone, she needed to ma ke a living. So the comprehens ion of nowadays where you could pick up a phone and you can call, and so what if she missed not co ming? So she will come next week. That was not there. When she missed that bus, there was this child that was still standing there waiting for her and conjuri ng up the imagination of being hugg ed and kissed and loved. She just didn't show up. And in the end, it took another six months, it wasn't so simple for me as a child. I didn't have somebody to tuck me in and hug me every day. So the disappointment was horrendous, and it obviously had to be horrendous if I still speak about it at 58 years old. I should have gotten over it long ago, but this explains a little bit that I'm trying to think why was that little bit of estrangement between us. It wasn't an estrangement, we were friends in some ways. 03:04:06 But in some ways, that warmth th at we had for each other on my part changed. Something changed in formula. I guess she was need y in one way; I was n eedy in another way. It's hard to explain. 41"

            "question": "Maybe you could summarize fo r me what happened after high school. You got married?",
            "answer": "I got married in 1957. August '57. To a young Israeli-born individual whose parents also came from Hungary, but they were in Isra el before the war, in the '30s. And so there was a sabra, and my husband right from the beginning spoke about the fact that he is -- he wants to come to America. Because he felt that there was a future, there is some thing that he -- he felt the need to go. That he needs to go, he needs to explore. He needs to find hi mself. And, of cour se, I never took him seriously, because neither one of us came from homes that could afford this luxury of going anywhere. And I really didn't think we'll ever come to America, but so I let him talk. But little did I know that at that time, I didn't know my husband well enough. Now, I would believe him, but in those days, I did not. And he really made arrangeme nts. He had an uncle in the United States in New York, and he made arrangemen ts through a friend who was in New York to arrange for the papers and for his uncle to loan him the money to come to the Un ited States. And once we'll get here, we'll work and we'll give him back the money. And within six months, we were in the United States. So little did I know what I hit me. We arrived in New York, and we worked in New York, the two of us. I worked in a sweat shop sewing doll clothes, and my husband who finished the technical high school just like me , went to work as a tool and di e maker in Brooklyn, New York. And we were looking for a way of solving the situation. Our friend s talked us into teaching Hebrew school. 03:07:00 I had a teacher's certificate anyway as a teacher, and my husband decided to try it. And we got a job as Hebrew school teachers in Schenectady, New York. During the summertime, not to remain in New York for such a long time, we went to -- we got a job in a camp. It's called Camp Ramah (ph), which is a Hebrew-speaking camp. And really that was wonderful. We spent the summer there, we 42 learned a lot. And during the wint er, we taught Hebrew school. A nd at that point, we have decided that there has to be a purpose why we came. We could not just leav e Israel, leave our friends, leave our parents, leave the home, and sp end some time teaching Hebrew school. That wasn't enough. So Simon started seriously studying for his SATs, and trying to learn by himself how to do -- how to take the tests and how to score. And a year later, we felt that Schenectady, New York is too isolated a place for us. This is just not -- wasn't the right place for two young people. We were very, very lonely and alone there. And after spending anot her summer in the summer camp, we got a job in Quincy, Massachusetts, which is south of Boston, 15 miles south of Boston. And we went to teach there in a very lovely congregat ion, and Simon applied to BU and was accepte d as an engineering student. And so our life was se t. We both worked full-time as Hebrew school teachers, and Simon went to school. And he graduate d within four years, aeronautical engineering. Then once that was done, we moved to New Yo rk. At this stage of our lives in 1964, we were married about seven years or so, and we really -- alre ady beforehand we really wanted to have children, start a family. I couldn't have any children. And so as a result , we started to look in to adoption which was impossible. In Boston they had the blue laws. Only Jewish chil dren can a Jewish couple adopt, and you could not adopt a child out of your faith. We went to New York, we applied again for adoption. The situation was very si milar in those days and very, very difficult. So Simon worked for Grumman Aircraft for two years, an d I went back -- I left the Hebrew school teaching, which was a good job and wonderful. 03:10:04 But I really desired a more creative job, and I wanted to design dresses. Just really what. I learned, and I was a dress designer for a children's manufactur er in New York. When we realized that we will never be able to adopt a child in New York, two years later Simon looked for a job in California, Los Angeles. Everybody told us that it's much easier to adopt children in Los Angeles, and that's the place for us to go. And so we took off, literally took off. Simon got a job through the 43 Wall Street Journal with L itten Industries, and we arrived in Los Angeles, total strangers again. The wandering Jews. We arrived in Los Angeles, we did not know a soul. I think we were in motel when we applied for adoption through the Los Angeles County of Adoption Agency. And we started working: Simon at Litten; me as a dress designer. Worked very har d, the two of us, to make end meet. And nine months late r we got our son, our first child. And we named him Terrence, a nice Irish name. And we gave him a Hebrew name, Alonim (ph) , wh ich is an oak tree. Nice and strong. And actually we call him Terry or Alonim, depending on what the mood is. And today he's 28 years old, he's married. He lives up in Vermon t with his wife. And he has no children, and I don't think he desires to have any. Later on, we adopted a little girl, and we named her Corey Tamar, but actually she's called Tammy. So she's not using any of formal names. Everybody calls her Tammy, and she's 24 years old. And she's e ngaged to be married, and she's finishing her Master's Degree in social work at Boston University. And a year from now in October, she'll get married to a wonderful y oung man who is at Yale Law School. And the two children really -- the two children with us form ed our little family. And we raised them in Califo rnia partially, and then Simon got a very good job over here in Washington an d we moved. 03:13:00 Terry was four and a half years old, and Tamm y was seven months old. And we moved to Washington. So I arrived with two little kids in a brand new area. Again, not knowing almost anyone. But before long, you know, we made friends, and we realized really that it doesn't matter where you live. It's the friends that you make in the place that counts. Every strange place is strange at first until you make some friends. And now we have so ma ny friends, we don't have time for everybody. And we live out in Potomac."

All the buildings in Israel are painted white or off-white or, you know, they ar e light colors. And I'm us ed to this tremendous sunshine shining on top of these bright buildings. I felt closed in, it frightened me. It really frightened me. It took time. Not a long time because we had to bounce on our feet , and we had to start going. And we didn't have tw o pennies to rub together, two cents. And if I tell you I used to go to work, I had ten cents to go on the subway one way. In those da ys it was ten cents. Ten cents to go down to work, and I had ten cents exactly to come back. And on Saturdays, the train stopped somehow on a different aven ue. Same street, but different avenue. It didn't stop -- the train didn't stop in the same place. I remember being very confused and overwhelmed, and I was ready to leave the subway station. But I wasn't sure where I was, and I -- in my little broken English, I spoke to the police officer. And I said, \"Are you sure that it's here? Because if it's not here and I cannot get to work, I have only ten cent s to go home. And I won't be able to get there.\" 03:16:01 I remember him putting his hand in his pocket and giving me another te n cents, just in case. Which was very nice."

            "answer": "I didn't go too much into the culture. I just was overwhelmed, for instance, surprised. We arrived to Simon's uncle, who was from Hungary, and his wife was also from Hungary. We arrived 45 and they were eating and watching television. I found it terribly rude. You know, I couldn't understand this. I could not compre hend this. Because, first of all, when we left Israel, they didn't have television so that's one detail. But second, when guests or somebody -- stranger came to the house, then you sat a nd you talked to them around the table. You didn't look at television. I mean the cars and everything, everything was a bit overwhelming at first. But in our own modest way, you know, we scaled things down. We knew how to lo ok inward and to know what we could afford and what we cannot a fford. I mean it wasn't that difficult for me to say -- we were not needy as much. You know, we could easily say, \"Well, we're not going to buy another skirt or another pair of pants or another shirt, because we just can't afford it this year. It's okay, we'll do it next year.\" And it next year came and we co uldn't afford it, we'll say, \"Well, that's okay, we'll do it the following year.\" But both of us were very grounded, and we had very strong priorities. We knew where it's at, we knew we had a goal. Once we decide d that we have a goal and Simon has to go to school and we are going to make it, not matter what, we always looked at the right things. And to be very honest with you, we have many friends w ho came from Israel, and most of them got some help from home. We real ly did it on our own. Our parents coul d not afford to help us. We helped our parents, we used to send mo ney home, too. Especially Simon' s parents, because his father was ill, and he could no longer work. Looking back then, we didn't think it was not fair. We did not think that it is overwhelming -- we di dn't think we were that unusual. We really took it that this is fine, and everything that we did we felt, well, this is a step -- just a little step better than what we had before. 03:19:05 Every little success or every little achievement that we achieved, it was great. Both of us are very optimistic people, and we really always felt that our cup is more than half full."

That's not to say that I was that courageous or that -- I'm sure that I had my fears, and I had my uncertainties and my feeling of not belo nging in certain places. It really takes time to belong to an area or to belong to a community, or to belong anywhere. A lot of people, a lot of Israelis are here for many , many years, and they love living here and so forth, but they feel a certain sense of not belonging. I no longer have that.

But I feel totally comfortable here, and I must say th at maybe with one or two excepti ons that I don't even want to recall or I don't even remember, I feel that I have always been treated fairly in America.

But that was because they did not have a school established yet, and I didn't see in my blurred visi on, I didn't see that that w ill come. And it was just really too difficult physically, the driving back and forth, back and fo rth to school. So he went to public school, but she went to the Jewish day school. But I tried to instill in them all the values of Judaism, because Judaism to me, it's not how religiou s you are; it's a way of life. It's how you live your life. What kind of a person you are. How you treat other people. How you behave towards another person. What kind of examples you set for yo ur children. That's what Judaism is for me.

It's so long.\" And he brought me a beautiful marble Mezuzah, and we dedicated the Mezuzah inside, indoors, not outdoors. 03:28:06 Because it was too precious for me to hang it outdoors. I have a smaller one outside. And so we hung that Mezuzah, and I'm sure that one day I will give it to my daughter. This is the family inheritance. That's it. No more, no less. But it's an important in heritance."

He put his life on the line every day during that war, and he put in jeopardy everybody 's life. He tried his best. I cry for all the people who did not survive. My father did not survive. I have aunts and uncles and cousins who never came back. People with broken lives. If he would have died, would it have saved them? Thank God that some of us survived. Whether it's me or so mebody else. I should feel guilty? I feel sad that there are such human bein gs in this world that are this inhumane, that are capable of murdering without reason, killing without reason, and hating so much. 03:31:04 You know, it's amazing to me that we who really have gone th rough so much with capacity to love. I don't have the capacity in me to hate. I only have the capacity to be compassionate for somebody else, whether it's a person like me or somebody else, a different color, a different race, different religion -- I don't care. And I'm no t alone, I know that most people are good. We brought it upon ourselves? I don't want to hear this. There are too many decent huma n lives lost, too many beautiful people. No t just them who died, but the potential of what they could have become and the families that they c ould have brought up to this world. Not the least bit."

We did very well for ourselves. Simon went into his own business and he did very well. We live a very charmed life now. I don't have financial worries. I don't have to worry about working or not working anymore. In fact, it was very funny, I stopped at Bridges of Georgetown today, and a young girl, maybe 18, she comes over. She says, \"My, you look nice today. We skipped work today, didn't we?\" she said to me. And I thought to myself -- I didn't answer, but I thought to myself it really takes a certain audacity, first of all, to turn to a customer to assume. And I really wanted to say, \"Actually, I'm not working. I don't have to if I don't want to.\" 03:34:05 I worked plenty throughout my life, but I was thinking it to myself. On the other hand, I don't ever take anything for granted, and I never forget where I came from. And I always think that I know where I'm going, but I never pretend that I was born into this or this was just something that came to me rightfully so. I really appr eciate every day, and I thank every da y for what I have and that I'm able to give instead of receiv ing. It's a great feeling."

But if it can change one hard heart to be compassiona te to a fellow human being, it was all worth it. To put it on tape, not to live it -- not to have lived it. To put it on tape. It's really one just can hope that we -- al ways I hope we learn some thing from it, but I'm not sure. It always worries me when the statement of hatred come out. Whether it's from this end or 51 that end, it frightens me. All the extremes who have no tolerance for somebody el se who's a little bit different than you are, it really frightens me. So one can ju st hope for the best, and I think a lot of education needs to be done. A lot, a lot of education. That's all that I can add."

My father is th e second one from the left at the top row. My grandparents are sitting between two of the little ch ildren. They actually had given birth to 15 children; 13 survived to adulthood. And some of them survived the war, and quite a few of them perished during the war. This is a picture of my grandfather on my moth er's side, Egnot Blythe (ph). He was the father of my mother. He gave birth -- or his wife gave birth to eight children who all survived to adulthood. And actually, five of them su rvived the war. Three of them with their families died during the war. This a picture of my mother and father, Irana Blythe (ph) and Wilmoth Moskovitz (ph). This is on their wedding day in Debrecen, the year approximately 1928. This is their wedding day. They ac tually look like a handsome couple. This is a picture of me. At that time, my name was Veronica Su zannah, and I'm standing in front of the tree. What you don't see in this picture, actually my father was standi ng behind the bushes, lo oking at me. And I'm all dressed up with a little outfit that my mother knitted. My mother always knitted little outfits for me and different things, and I just loved to wear them. So there I am with my little doll and myself. And the city is Debrecen, and I must be here about three years old. This pi cture of our family was taken in 1942 in Cluj. This is our family: my brother who is seven and a half years older; I must have been close to five years old in this picture. Andy my fath er, Wilmoth; my mother, Irana and my brother whose Hungaria n name was Tibor and his Hebrew name is Hyne (p h). This picture was taken in the apartment building that I lived. This was a neighbor, a young Jewish girl, who I played 52 with quite a bit while we lived in Cluj. And you can see me dressed in like a little navy uniform and an apron that was very much the fashion of the day, and that's how I was sent to school. I had various navy dresses that looked like little sailor dresses in various colors. But that was the fashion, and, of course, a big bow in my hair. And she's doing her homework , she was older than me. I was just pretending. I was still in kindergarten, I didn't know how to read and write. But that picture remained, and she never survived the war. That family neve r survived unfortunately. This picture was taken in 1945 in Switzerland after we were li berated from Bergen-Belsen, and it depicts the background of Switzerland, of cour se. And my brother, Tibi, myse lf and my mother standing in front of a beautiful fountain in Sw itzerland. That was just before we were taken to Bari, Italy and from there to Israel, to Palestine. This picture is of me and my brother, H yne. This is already we changed our name to Hebrew names, and this photogr aph was taken in Israel, I think in 1945 or '46. My mother had us pose specifically so that she can send back pictures to surviving relatives in Hungary so they can see that we al ive and we are well in Israel. Conclusion of interview."
