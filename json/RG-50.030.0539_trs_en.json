So it\u2122s three buildings around a large courtyard. It was in another part of the city. I knew that th ere were two places like this. Ours was destroyed later, cause they put the \u0152 a road there. They built a road there. And the other place, he went there. And in both places there were Jewish \u0152 there only Jewish people living. And he went around, first in the main street of the city and asked people, remember the Jews who lived here? Nobody know. He went into this house, where only Jews lived, in all of the three buildings. And when they came out and they were standing around him, and he says to them, remember the Jews who lived here? Not one. You look at the people, he took pictures. Old people that certainly Interview with Saul Merin April 19, 2009 67lived there, you know, in the second World War. Nobo dy remembers. Then a dog passed by, and he looks at the dog, and the woman sticks out her head from one of the windows and calls, Aaron, Aaron . So he says to her, that\u2122s the name of the dog? She says yes. Why Aaron ? So she says, Aaron, that\u2122s so that we remember the Jews who lived here. This was the first time that he found somebody who remembered the Jews, you know , through the dog. This is ridiculous. That\u2122s not the same anti-Semitism that frightened my pare nts and the Jews before the war, or even after the war, in the first years after the war.
