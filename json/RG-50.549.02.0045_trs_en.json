Near us was [indecipherable] from pilots, where the Germans shot down. French pilot, English pilot. We didn\u2019t speak English, but they cut the wires, and they told us we are free, because the German ran away from the camp, they locked up, and we didn\u2019t know the war was over, either, but we understood what\u2019s happened. They went out, and we went out, and we started to run to the houses to get some food. But all the houses was empty, not with food, with people, because they were sure when we came out 1n the camp, they going to kill them.

            "question": "-- the war\u2019s over, we\u2019re free, do you remember -- did -- anything people said to each other, or how did -- do you remember your own emotions at that time?",
            "answer": "Yes, we -- we was -- we was happy the war -- the war was an end, but we wasn\u2019t happy, we lost everybody. But we didn\u2019t know what to do, actually. It -- 1t wasn\u2019t organized, nothing was organized, we just was running from one city to the other, and we wouldn\u2019t know what we going to do, where we going to end up. It wasn\u2019t yet order -- we made a mistake, we went back to Poland, that was all. We couldn\u2019t go back to Germany later. So a lot of people who stayed in Germany, they organized them, and they got help. We didn\u2019t have any help in Poland. I came back to my city, and I went up to the government to ask for help, we were 10 girls. So he gave us the key from the school, where we was finishing school, that building belonged to a Jewish family, but they -- they got killed. So I told them, \u201cHow about food?\u201d He said, \u201cNothing else. Just stay.\u201d So Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection we were sleeping on the floor, and we were starving, actually. We didn\u2019t have what to eat. It was horrible. So, after a couple weeks, some people from my town came back to the city, and he told us that we shouldn\u2019t stay there, because they already killed four girls that went in -- in a hiding place there. The Armia kryova went in, they killed them, and one was hiding under the bedsheet in Israel, they tried to kill them. So the -- the life was very danger in Poland. So he says, \u201cDon\u2019t stay in that city, you\u2019re going to be caught -- killed. You better come to Lodz, to a big city there are kibbutzim there, they\u2019ll take you in.\u201d So we were happy to have [indecipherable] had, and a piece of bread. You could only stay six months. We have to smuggle ourselves to Israel. So I -- I knew I had a brother in Russia, I was already in contact with him, so I didn\u2019t want to go, I want to wait. So they send me to another kibbutz, in Bialystok, to stay another six month. We stood there a couple months, in this -- and these, the Polish people was very angry, they didn\u2019t want the Jews back. So one night they came in, the police, and they give us ammunition, they going to attack us, going to be a pogrom, you have to defend yourself, we can do nothing about it. So five people went to [indecipherable] on the train. We tried to pull out from Bialystok. Four of them got killed, they took them down from the train, 18 - 19 year old. What -- Hitler let them live, but the Polish wouldn\u2019t let them live. One was hiding under a pleated skirt by a lady in the train, so he survived. So he crawled back, and he told us to pick up the bodies. So, when I saw that, in time my brother came in, so I pick up my brother, and I says, \u201cI\u2019m not staying here. I\u2019m going to [indecipherable] right here the Bricha taking out the people,\u201d because they says it\u2019s a Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection graveyard in Poland.. When we went out on the street, and we saw dead people, dead Jews, they wasn\u2019t missed by nobody, their families was killed a couple years ago in the camps, and they came back from Russia. So they got killed in Poland. So I took my brother, and I went on the train. We sitting on the train, and a Polish woman says to me, \u201cYou know, they took down yesterday, Jews, and they killed them.\u201d Like she gave me the idea that I\u2019m going to be killed too, in a couple hours. So I almost fainted. Finally, we reach Vulsa -- we came into Vulsa, I fainted. I couldn\u2019t take it any longer. So I find out that the Bricha organized people -- actually, they organized people who came back from Russia. Russia let in a half a million Jews. So the older people -- so I got together with them, and we start to go -- the Jewish agency made up with American government that Czechoslovaki should let us in, out from Poland. It was like a couple thousand people. I was the only one with a number, actually. So, we went to Czechoslovakia. In Czechoslovakia we stood overnight, and we have to go to Austria, and they prepare camps for us. We came to Austria, a few thousand people. The people who should provide us with bread, sold the flour, and we didn\u2019t have nothing to eat, we have to run in the field to dig out a potato -- a pickle, to eat. That was after the war, in 1946. In time, I met my husband, because he had a couple brothers in Russia, in the army. So he told the Russian people coming back from Russia, maybe one of his brothers will survive. None of them survived, they all got killed. So I met my husband, so he says to me, \u201cHow comes a number\u2019? It\u2019s mostly people with the Russian.\u201d So I told him I was waiting for my brother, he\u2019Il -- til he came back from Russia, and together I decided to leave Poland. We have our chance, the Bricha -- thanks to the Bricha. So my husband told me that he got papers to go to the United States in a month, a cousin sent him papers. But if I marry, two people can go on the same certificate. I didn\u2019t even know my husband, to be honest with you. I decided, what do I got to leave? Israel is closed the doors, you couldn\u2019t go to Israel anyway, we have to smuggle ourselves. The people who went there, went to Cyprus, you know. I didn\u2019t have where to go, I was hungry. My husband, when he was liberated, he didn\u2019t live this town. So the UNRRA gave him -- put him in a hotel, and they gave him three meals a day. So when I came in, I see this [indecipherable] table, with white tablecloth, and eating. I couldn\u2019t believe it, that\u2019s a dream. So I decided I got married, only the condition my brother should stay with us. So that\u2019s what\u2019s happened. From that month, turn into two years. They didn\u2019t let into the United State, they\u2019re going to elect a president, it took two year. So, a very hard time in Austria. We couldn\u2019t work, we have to live on a ration, [indecipherable] gave us. A herring, a piece of bread, and that\u2019s how we lived for two year. Finally, we find out, in order to go to America, we have to go to Vienna. Vienna was occupied by the Russian. So we got ourselves on that train, and we start to go. The Russian soldier came out, and he says, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t go there.\u201d So he took us down from the train. So we was waiting for another train, and we came to Vienna, on the boat, on Vienna. Now, we have to go out from Vienna to Germany, with our paper. Rush -- Vienna was occupied by the Russian, so we couldn\u2019t go. So we were standing, they tore us down from the other train, and they told us, \u201cYou got to live here, you got to vote here, and die here. You can never go out from here.\u201d We were like 10 people. So, we standing at night, and thinking what we going to do, til a -- a German guy, a young guy came over to us, and he says to us, like that, \u201cYou know, my father takes people over the border. If you want to go, you give me a few dollars, til -- Pll take you, show how to go over the mountain.\u201d If I see the mountain during the day, I wouldn\u2019t climb up. So we took -- I said, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s going to be if he catch you?\u201d The Russian is out - downstairs, you could see they working with the car. He says, \u201cWell, I tell him my cow got lost, and I went to look for the cow.\u201d He got us over the mountain, we stay overnight, but how we got down from the mountain, the very high mountain, I figured maybe I lay down [indecipherable] they had a hard time to get down. We came down, finally, from the mountain, we didn\u2019t carry anything. We came down from the mountain, we already on the other side, in Germany. In Germany, you can\u2019t go in a hotel at night, everything is closed. And it\u2019s raining, we don\u2019t have a place where to go. While we was walking, I walk over -- a man was walking with a lady, and I says to him, \u201cWhat -- we just came from the other side, and it\u2019s raining. Where can we go?\u201d So he says to us, \u201cCome on, I'll take you to a hotel, maybe they\u2019ll let you in.\u201d So we thank him, we came in the hotel, and the guy said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, no room.\u201d I says to him, \u201cListen, I don\u2019t care what you see, I\u2019m going to sit here in the lobby, I\u2019m not going out in the rain. No way I\u2019m going out. We don\u2019t -- we just came in, and we have no place else to go.\u201d So he gave us a room, and we stood there. Once we got there, we went to Bremen, in Germany, and we have to wait like five weeks til we can go to America. The problem is, people who came to the Joint, got it good. They greet them by the plane. They gave them -- they pay six months rent, they gave them a job. We didn\u2019t came through the Joint. My husband\u2019s cousin was a religious man, he wants to show in the shul he do something, so he borrowed the paper for somebody else, so they was not responsible for us. So, we came he -- we came to Boston. From Boston we have to take a train to Chicago. Nobody waits for us, we didn\u2019t know any langu -- English, nothing. So we sitting in the Union Station, and in the morning -- a whole night -- in the morning, I hear Polish women, speaks Polish to each other. They come to clean -- and I finished school in Poland. So I walked up and tell them the story there. Nobody waits for us, where should we go, what should we do? So they pick up a telephone book, I gave them the address and the telephone, and they called the people, and they picked us up. They picked us up, then we came to Chicago. I came to the HIAS, and told them the story, they said, \u201cWe\u2019re not responsible for you, you can\u2019t -- we don\u2019t want to do nothing, not even a job.\u201d Luckily, I find here a friend, he took me into the factory to work. I was two days in this country, I went to work. And I didn\u2019t even have money for the car fare, a dime, so he paid the car fare. And I went there, I got a job. My husband didn\u2019t get a job right away. We went through a very hard time in Chicago, we couldn\u2019t get a -- a place there to live. We stayed with them three, four weeks, so finally they rented a room for us. The lady put in, in a closet, she put in a bed, in a walk- in closet. There was no heat, where to put a chair. That\u2019s wasn\u2019t a -- that wasn\u2019t the worst thing. She got three teenage girls, we couldn\u2019t use a washroom in the morning, and I have to run downtown to punch a card. So I washed my face in the kitchen, and I ran for work. I worked a couple of years downtown, til -- til finally we got another apartment, you Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection know, just rented. If you was lucky, just rented an apartment, by somebody, not on our own. So finally, my husband couldn\u2019t get a job, so somebody recommended the [indecipherable] work he does, a lot of Jewish and Polish people open up a cleaning store. For that you don\u2019t need money. You take an empty store, you buy an old sewing machine. I still didn\u2019t give up my job. So I worked there, we open up the cleaning store, my husband was in the cleaning store, and that\u2019s the work, I came to work in the store, and I worked til 12 at night to keep up the thing. Next couple years, and I already have a little money in the bank saved up, and I have the children. You know, it was very hard, the beginning, we don\u2019t have help from nobody. Mostly refugees come, they have a lot of help. The Joint pay the rent, they -- they get them a job, they watch over them. I didn\u2019t have that luck, so the same thing after the war, people stay in Germany, the -- right away there was organized camp, they got what to eat. We was on the bad side, we was in Poland, we couldn\u2019t go back, the Russian didn\u2019t let us go to the border. So, we live hard times."
