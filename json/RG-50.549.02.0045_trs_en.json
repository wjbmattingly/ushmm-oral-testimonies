Near us was [indecipherable] from pilots, where the Germans shot down. French pilot, English pilot. We didn\u2122t speak English, but they cut the wires, and they told us we are free, because the German ran away from the camp, they locked up, and we didn\u2122t know the war was over, either, but we understood what\u2122s happened. They went out, and we went out, and we started to run to the houses to get some food.

            "answer": "Yes, we -- we was -- we was happy the war -- the war was an end, but we wasn\u2122t happy, we lost everybody. But we didn\u2122t know what to do, actually. It -- it wasn\u2122t organized, nothing was organized, we just was running from one city to the other, and we wouldn\u2122t know what we going to do, where we going to end up. It wasn\u2122t yet order -- we made a mistake, we went back to Poland, that was all. We couldn\u2122t go back to Germany later. So a lot of people who stayed in Germany, they organized them, and they got help. We didn\u2122t have any help in Poland. I came back to my city, and I went up to the government to ask for help, we were 10 girls. So he gave us the key from the school, where we was finishing school, that building belonged to a Jewish family, but they -- they got killed. So I told them, \ufb01How about food?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Nothing else. Just stay.\ufb02 So USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 7 we were sleeping on the floor, and we were starving, actually. We didn\u2122t have what to eat. It was horrible. So, after a couple weeks, some people from my town came back to the city, and he told us that we shouldn\u2122t stay there, because they already killed four girls that went in -- in a hiding place there. The Armia kryova went in, they killed them, and one was hiding under the bedsheet in Israel, they tried to kill them. So the -- the life was very danger in Poland. So he says, \ufb01Don\u2122t stay in that city, you\u2122re going to be caught -- killed. You better come to L\u00f3dz, to a big city there are kibbutzim there, they\u2122ll take you in.\ufb02 So we were happy to have [indecipherable] had, and a piece of bread. You could only stay six months. We have to smuggle ou rselves to Israel. So I -- I knew I had a brother in Russia, I was already in contact with him, so I didn\u2122t want to go, I want to wait. So they send me to another kibbutz, in Bialystok, to stay another six month. We stood there a couple months, in this -- and th ese, the Polish people was very angry, they didn\u2122t want the Jews back. So one night th ey came in, the police, and they give us ammunition, they going to attack us, going to be a pogrom, you have to defend yourself, we can do nothing about it. So five people went to [indecipherable] on the train. We tried to pull out from Bialystok. Four of them got killed, they to ok them down from the train, 18 - 19 year old. What -- Hitler let them live, but the Polish wouldn\u2122t let them live. One was hiding under a pleated skirt by a lady in the train, so he survived. So he crawled back, and he told us to pick up the bodies. So, when I saw that, in time my brother came in, so I pick up my brother, and I says , \ufb01I\u2122m not staying here. I\u2122m going to [indecipherable] right here the Bricha taking out the people,\ufb02 because they says it\u2122s a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 8 graveyard in Poland.. When we went out on the street, and we saw dead people, dead Jews, they wasn\u2122t missed by nobody, their families was killed a couple years ago in the camps, and they came back from Russia. So they got killed in Poland. So I took my brother, and I went on the train. We sitting on the train, and a Polish woman says to me, \ufb01You know, they took down yesterday, Jews, and they killed them.\ufb02 Like she gave me the idea that I\u2122m going to be killed too, in a couple hours. So I almost fainted. Finally, we reach Vulsa -- we came into Vulsa, I fainted. I couldn\u2122t take it any longer. So I find out that the Bricha organized people -- actually , they organized peopl e who came back from Russia. Russia let in a half a million Jews. So the older people -- so I got together with them, and we start to go -- the Jewish agency made up with American government that Czechoslovaki should let us in, out from Pola nd. It was like a couple thousand people. I was the only one with a number, actually. So, we went to Czechoslovakia. In Czechoslovakia we stood overnigh t, and we have to go to Austria, and they prepare camps for us. We came to Austria, a few thousand people. The people who should provide us with bread, sold the flour, and we didn\u2122t have nothi ng to eat, we have to run in the field to dig out a potato -- a pickle, to eat. That was after the war, in 1946. In time, I met my husband, because he had a couple brothe rs in Russia, in the army. So he told the Russian people coming back from Russia, maybe one of his brothers will survive. None of them survived, they all got killed. So I met my husband, so he says to me, \ufb01How comes a number? It\u2122s mostly people with the Russian.\ufb02 So I told him I was waiting for my brother, he\u2122ll -- til he came back from Russia, and together I decided to leave Poland. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 9 We have our chance, the Bricha -- thanks to the Bricha. So my husband told me that he got papers to go to the United States in a month, a cousin sent him papers. But if I marry, two people can go on the same certificate. I didn\u2122t even know my husband, to be honest with you. I decided, what do I got to leave? Israel is closed the doors, you couldn\u2122t go to Israel anyway, we have to smuggle ourselves . The people who went there, went to Cyprus, you know. I didn\u2122t have where to go , I was hungry. My husband, when he was liberated, he didn\u2122t live this town. So the UNRRA gave him -- put him in a hotel, and they gave him three meals a day. So when I came in, I see this [indecipherable] table, with white tablecloth, and eating. I couldn\u2122t be lieve it, that\u2122s a dream. So I decided I got married, only the condition my brother should st ay with us. So that\u2122s what\u2122s happened. From that month, turn into two years. They didn\u2122t let into the Unite d State, they\u2122re going to elect a president, it took two year. So, a very hard time in Austria. We couldn\u2122t work, we have to live on a ration, [indecipherable] gave us. A herring, a piece of bread, and that\u2122s how we lived for two year. Finally, we find out, in order to go to America, we have to go to Vienna. Vienna was occupied by the Russian. So we got ourselves on that train, and we start to go. The Russian soldier came out, and he says , \ufb01No, you can\u2122t go there.\ufb02 So he took us down from the train. So we wa s waiting for another train, and we came to Vienna, on the boat, on Vienna. Now, we have to go out from Vienna to Germany, with our paper. Rush -- Vienna was occupied by the Russian, so we couldn\u2122t go. So we were standing, they tore us down from the other train, and they told us, \ufb01You got to live here, you got to vote here, and di e here. You can never go out from here.\ufb02 We were like 10 USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 10 people. So, we standing at night, and thinking what we going to do, til a -- a German guy, a young guy came over to us, a nd he says to us, like that, \ufb01You know, my father takes people over the border. If you want to go, you give me a few dollars, til -- I\u2122ll take you, show how to go over the mountain.\ufb02 If I see the mountain during the day, I wouldn\u2122t climb up. So we took -- I said, \ufb01What\u2122s going to be if he catch you?\ufb02 The Russian is out - downstairs, you could see they working with the car. He says, \ufb01Well, I tell him my cow got lost, and I went to look for the cow.\ufb02 He got us over the mountain, we stay overnight, but how we got down from the mountain, the very high mountain, I figured maybe I lay down [indecipherable] they had a hard time to get down. We came down, finally, from the mountain, we didn\u2122t carry anything. We came down from the mountain, we already on the other side, in Germany. In Germany, you can\u2122t go in a hotel at night, everything is closed. And it\u2122s raining, we don\u2122t have a place where to go. While we was walking, I walk over -- a man was walking with a lady, and I says to him, \ufb01What -- we just came from the other side, and it\u2122s raining. Where can we go?\ufb02 So he says to us, \ufb01Come on, I\u2122ll take you to a hotel, maybe they\u2122ll let you in.\ufb02 So we thank him, we came in the hotel, and the guy said, \ufb01I\u2122m sorry, no room.\ufb02 I says to him, \ufb01Listen, I don\u2122t care what you see, I\u2122m going to sit here in the lobby, I\u2122m not going out in the rain. No way I\u2122m going out. We don\u2122t -- we just came in, and we have no place else to go.\ufb02 So he gave us a room, and we stood there. Once we got there, we went to Bremen, in Germany, and we have to wait like five weeks til we can go to America. The problem is, people who came to the Joint, got it good. They greet them by the plane. Th ey gave them -- they pay six months rent, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 11 they gave them a job. We didn\u2122t came th rough the Joint. My husband\u2122s cousin was a religious man, he wants to show in the shul he do something, so he borrowed the paper for somebody else, so they was not responsible for us. So, we came he -- we came to Boston. From Boston we have to take a train to Chicago. Nobody waits for us, we didn\u2122t know any langu -- English, nothing. So we sitting in the Union Station, and in the morning -- a whole night -- in the morning, I hear Polish women, speaks Polish to each other. They come to clean -- and I finished school in Poland. So I walked up and tell them the story there. Nobody waits for us, where should we go, what should we do? So they pick up a telephone book, I gave them the a ddress and the telephone, and they called the people, and they picked us up. They picked us up, then we came to Chicago. I came to the HIAS, and told them the story, they said , \ufb01We\u2122re not responsible for you, you can\u2122t -- we don\u2122t want to do nothing, not even a job.\ufb02 Lu ckily, I find here a friend, he took me into the factory to work. I was two days in th is country, I went to work. And I didn\u2122t even have money for the car fare, a dime, so he paid the car fare. And I went there, I got a job. My husband didn\u2122t get a job ri ght away. We went through a very hard time in Chicago, we couldn\u2122t get a -- a place there to live. We stayed with them three, four weeks, so finally they rented a room for us. The lady put in, in a closet, she put in a bed, in a walk-in closet. There was no heat, where to put a chair. That\u2122s wasn\u2122t a -- that wasn\u2122t the worst thing. She got three teenage girls, we couldn\u2122t use a washroom in the morning, and I have to run downtown to punch a card. So I washed my face in the kitchen, and I ran for work. I worked a couple of years downtown, til -- til finally we got another apartment, you USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0045 12 know, just rented. If you was lucky, just rented an apartment, by somebody, not on our own. So finally, my husband couldn\u2122t ge t a job, so somebody recommended the [indecipherable] work he does, a lot of Jewish and Polish people open up a cleaning store. For that you don\u2122t need money. You take an empty store, you buy an old sewing machine. I still didn\u2122t give up my job. So I worked there, we open up the cleaning store, my husband was in the cleaning store, and that \u2122s the work, I came to work in the store, and I worked til 12 at night to keep up the thing. Next couple years, and I already have a little money in the bank saved up, and I have the children. You know, it was very hard, the beginning, we don\u2122t have he lp from nobody. Mostly refugees come, they have a lot of help. The Joint pay the rent, they -- they get them a job, they watch over them. I didn\u2122t have that luck, so the same thing after the war, people stay in Germany, the -- right away there was organized camp, they got what to eat. We was on the bad side, we was in Poland, we couldn\u2122t go back, th e Russian didn\u2122t let us go to the border. So, we live hard times."
