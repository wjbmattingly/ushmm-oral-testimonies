The American students, for instance, came, studying medicine, to Germany. We really was a brilliant country. And suddenly, everything was gone, everything was gone. And it was, for sure, the Treaty of Versailles after the war, which made Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Niklas Frank \u201cue June 6, 2016 Hitler possible. My father wrote in his youngster\u2019s diary, Germany needs his honor back. We need a strong person, who can fulfill this task. Maybe it\u2019s me. But then it was Hitler. So, the middle class in Germany, and I would say most of the people, were really looking for becoming a nation again, full of honor. This was the one side. And the other side was really the economical situation, which was very bad. And there was about 10 million unemployed people, growing, and we had the inflation. And then suddenly there were the people in the brown dress, marching in good rows [indecipherable] in German, the word, yes. And they had the special program, not looking to the right, and to the left, just we have our program, and hitting everybody who was against it. For instance, the communists, yes. So this was it \u2014 something which a lot of people attracted, in Germany. And Hitler was a brilliant speaker. He was really very good. He wouldn\u2019t have succeeded if at this time was already TV, for instance. It was his personal appearance, and this very, very strong speeches he delivered everywhere. And when he came to power, he really managed that the unemployment was nearly gone. And there was a big, big improvement in Germany.
