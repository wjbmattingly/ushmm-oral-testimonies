You had to show your I.D. all the time in France to get into buildings and so. And there I was: Nicole Denier. Nicole, Nicole Horowitz would have been much different.

And it was in a neighborhood near the Luxembourg, which up to this day I like very much. Which my daughter, when she visited it, thought was ridiculously poor. But she didn\u2019t realize that at the time I thought it was a little jewel. My mother had great taste and it was a small apartment but extremely sunny and opposite the elementary school where I went. And I had a cozy family..."

And the interesting thing about the Catholic grandparents is that my grandfather never allowed the name of his son pronounced in front of him the moment he left us, never. He... the mother was more tender-hearted and kept in touch. But he never would like to see the letters; he was not interested in ever hearing from that man."

            "answer": "I don\u2019t think... It\u2019s interesting, when \u2014 much later, when I went into her papers, when she died and I went to settle things, I found love letters of Pierre Denier that she had still kept. I don\u2019t think his name was ever mentioned in the house of his parents because they felt so shameful, but they certainly took over. They had a house in Brittany, and they spent three months of the year. The whole summer they spent in Brittany with the grandparents."

            "answer": "Oh, very much and intellectually. He \u2014 my grandfather was for his job but extremely intellectual. He made his money by making up, what you would call, the New York Times crossword puzzle. And then once a year, he would go \u2014 he never went out; they were very sedentary. But once a year he would get dressed, go out and compete, there was a competition and that made the money for the rest of the year."

            "num": 28,
            "question": "Really?",
            "answer": "So his money was made really from crossword puzzles. Either winning the competition \u2014 that was a yearly thing \u2014 or making them up in the name of the guy who signed for them, for something that would be Le Monde, that was a great newspaper of the day. And that meant that he was encyclop\u00e9dique. When he died, there was a fight over who would get his dictionary, because the dictionaries were annotated and it counted a lot. He trained us, he teached us in Latin, in French. He had groups of our little friends come every... once a week to study with him and he was great. I mean, they were just great. And it was very, very modest life. They did not have any hot water. They did not have any running water except in one faucet in the whole house. So you can read those breaux (ph) that you see now, people collect them. But for us it was a necessity of life. You had to heat your water and then have them pour it and then you had those big bowls and you wash like that."

And she had what is now the students\u2019 quarters in the building where we used to live, because they had the, had the view. It was on the sixth floor. All that floor was maids.

I married a man who 1s that way and I mean, he spends his time watching T.V. and they say \u201cwho\u201d when they should say \u201cwhom\u201d, and he says \u201cwhom\u201d aloud. I can hear him from my room because he is incensed. It\u2019s built in you, that you speak well, but you wear their discard as clothes \u2014 except for shoes; the rich never give their shoes.

He was gone by the time of 27\" of January; he left around middle January. So, if you count the time where I am very busy dating, it\u2019s December to the third week of January. And then he said he was interested. And then, again, we hadn\u2019t touched each other; we hadn\u2019t even kissed on the cheek. He had sat by my bed and we had discoursed for a long time in the evening, and what happened and what is what I deeply believe in \u2014 I don\u2019t know that my children do, but, but that\u2019s their lives \u2014 I believe that to marry somebody you have to have the same political opinions, if not religious opinions. We were both at ease, and both left \u2014 not too far left, but for the poor. Okay? You have two things in common, you have it made. With Toulet (ph), he was Catholic, practicing Catholic and far right. As we said to each other, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to go out for election, we stay home\u201d and we would cancel each other. We cannot marry and make it, and make a 60-year commitment, as I with John, with somebody who destroys your vote when you go to the voting booth. So that counted a lot. We were really very close, so I said, \u201cNo, I am not going to touch, marriage-wise, anybody in uniform.\u201d I had seen the French uniform, the English uniform, the German uniform, the American uniform. \u201cYou go back home and come back dressed properly.\u201d So, he went back to wherever it was in the States, got demobilized, got into his uniform and then he came back. Then he came back and he rang the bell. And my mother, who had cried \u2014 Oh, he sent to me from... He came back by boat; at the time we didn\u2019t have the planes \u2014 So, he sent me a telegram and said, \u201cReserve the 14\"\". Signed, the Huron\u201d which 1s the critical term that Voltaire has for guys from the Pampa. And he came back... Oh, do my dates make sense? He left in December, we wrote to each other, he came back on the 13\" of July and the 13\" in the evening we were then engaged."

So we did. And the 13\" or the 14\" we were engaged. And when we were married, the French did not like at all officially the idea that a French woman would marry an American, not done.

By that time, I was closing in and starting having to write a thesis since I passed all the exams, and I had to pass one in French, which I remember \u2018cause John said it was a big joke \u2018cause it took me a long time. He didn\u2019t realize it was a test on my English, not just my French. Dr. Smith took off and I was left in the lurch, and at that point, I said, \u201cLook, who needs it? I have a certificate of proficiency in all the fields...\u201d even in German \u2014 that\u2019s when I studied German. And if I had time, that\u2019s what I would study. I\u2019m fascinated by deepening the German language. I had to study German for the PhD in Greek because many of the learned books on Ancient Greeks are in German. So, I passed the German proficiency exam; it was a written exam not a spoken one. Oh, I remember going to a course and there was a guy teaching the course. And I was distraught at the idea of coming from the war, having to study German, and he began to say something in German to the class and I utterly disliked it. And he sensed it and he called me after class and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t you feel that way. I am a Jew. So, you don\u2019t have to be so frightened of me.\u201d But I was delighted that I had only to write, to know how to read. And I love the literature. And I love the literature... I have to find those books. Anybody that can find those books for me is my love. There was a series of books, nine in number, which are extremely well done by cognates. You, you have to realize that 75 percent of all of the languages have common Greek and Latin roots. So, you start with the literature; it\u2019s all written in German. And you read the nine little books and at the end, you are reading German."
