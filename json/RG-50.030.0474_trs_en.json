And that meant that he was encyclop\u00e9dique. When he died, there was a fight over who would get his dictionary, because the dictionaries were annotated and it counted a lot. He trained us, he teached us in Latin, in French. He had groups of our little friends come every\u2013 once a week to study with him and he was great. I m ean, they were just great. And it was very, very modest life. They did not have any hot water. They did not have any running water except in one faucet in the whole house. So you can read those breaux (ph) that you see now, people collect them. But for us it was a necessity of life.
