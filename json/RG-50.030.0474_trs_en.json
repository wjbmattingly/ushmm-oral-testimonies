It\u2019s interesting, when \u2014 much later, when I went into her papers, when she died and I went to settle things, I found love letters of Pierre Denier that she had still kept. I don\u2019t think his name was ever mentioned in the house of his parents because they felt so shameful, but they certainly took over. They had a house in Brittany, and they spent three months of the year. The whole summer they spent in Brittany with the grandparents."

He made his money by making up, what you would call, the New York Times crossword puzzle. And then once a year, he would go \u2014 he never went out; they were very sedentary.

Either winning the competition \u2014 that was a yearly thing \u2014 or making them up in the name of the guy who signed for them, for something that would be Le Monde, that was a great newspaper of the day. And that meant that he was encyclop\u00e9dique. When he died, there was a fight over who would get his dictionary, because the dictionaries were annotated and it counted a lot. He trained us, he teached us in Latin, in French. He had groups of our little friends come every... once a week to study with him and he was great. I mean, they were just great. And it was very, very modest life. They did not have any hot water. They did not have any running water except in one faucet in the whole house. So you can read those breaux (ph) that you see now, people collect them. But for us it was a necessity of life. You had to heat your water and then have them pour it and then you had those big bowls and you wash like that."

I can hear him from my room because he is incensed. It\u2019s built in you, that you speak well, but you wear their discard as clothes \u2014 except for shoes; the rich never give their shoes.

And the Jews were forced to go in the last train. And so the word was in Paris that everybody had to go in the last train. It was a sort of an extraordinary joke, because you couldn\u2019t get into the Jewish trains. And this is where I have my little quote about my mother and the French anti-Semite. I escorted her very often because I was afraid for her. So, I was once in the train with her, and we were in the last train, and she came in the train, push shoving and there was, of course, no sitting place free, until a very tall gentleman, very distingu\u00e9, de Gaulle-type, you know \u2014 very strange to be that tall but very distingu\u00e9. And he got up all his height, bowed to her very low and gave her his seat and said to her, and I remember that was my war quote: \u201cAh, Madame, when are we going to be allowed to be anti-s\u00e9mite again?\u201d [Pauses] I love that."

And in the courtyard, there 1s a truck and the back of the truck flips down and at that point, you\u2019re pushed in. And at that moment, it was bedlam. The women were hysterical. The whole tr-... the whole thing was crowded; there were too many people for the courtyard. And my mother kept after those two little guys \u2014 and she was much more in danger than you can imagine \u2014 was keeping after them saying, \u201cLet her go, she shouldn\u2019t be here, let her go!\u201d And at some point, they said, \u201cThe hell with you, get out of here!\u201d And at that point, I lost all my courage. I began to cry and she found all her courage back and she was, that little roly-poly with no gumption at all, was smiling and said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s get out.\u201d And she knew how to get out and she knew how to find the caf\u00e9. And she stood there at the Jewish caf\u00e9, which 1s still there, it\u2019s a Jewish caf\u00e9, and she plunked down and she had to have her cafe, in front of all the trucks going by."

And it was almost instinctive and they did. And the Swiss, I remember them saying to me, \u201cOne of you deportees has stolen again.\u201d And it really hurt me because it was a complete misunderstanding of who they were. They were like animals; they had been hungry for so long that they couldn\u2019t resist. You had to have the understanding that the Swiss didn\u2019t. But they had the food. And the fresh air. So that they got better. And they had very good hospitals, very good hospitals, and the hospital care was great. And my job was to be, you know, to come in the room and be fresh and available. And some to them would die and I would call the family and be there when they died and comfort the family and be present at the funeral.

We were both at ease, and both left \u2014 not too far left, but for the poor. Okay? You have two things in common, you have it made. With Toulet (ph), he was Catholic, practicing Catholic and far right. As we said to each other, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to go out for election, we stay home\u201d and we would cancel each other. We cannot marry and make it, and make a 60-year commitment, as I with John, with somebody who destroys your vote when you go to the voting booth. So that counted a lot. We were really very close, so I said, \u201cNo, I am not going to touch, marriage-wise, anybody in uniform.\u201d I had seen the French uniform, the English uniform, the German uniform, the American uniform. \u201cYou go back home and come back dressed properly.\u201d So, he went back to wherever it was in the States, got demobilized, got into his uniform and then he came back. Then he came back and he rang the bell. And my mother, who had cried \u2014 Oh, he sent to me from... He came back by boat; at the time we didn\u2019t have the planes \u2014 So, he sent me a telegram and said, \u201cReserve the 14\"\".

I\u2019m fascinated by deepening the German language. I had to study German for the PhD in Greek because many of the learned books on Ancient Greeks are in German. So, I passed the German proficiency exam; it was a written exam not a spoken one. Oh, I remember going to a course and there was a guy teaching the course.

I have to find those books. Anybody that can find those books for me is my love. There was a series of books, nine in number, which are extremely well done by cognates. You, you have to realize that 75 percent of all of the languages have common Greek and Latin roots. So, you start with the literature; it\u2019s all written in German.
