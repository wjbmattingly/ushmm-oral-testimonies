            "answer": "Well, I\u2019ve seen it, I\u2019ve seen the paper, I\u2019ve seen the paper in their hand. These were actually Wehrmacht guards by now, so most of the SS guards ran away. But as we were marching with these Wehrmacht guards, from the lans \u2014 last concentration camp, which was a subcamp of Dachau, Landsberg, we were supposedly marching towards the Tyrolean mountains, and they knew the ne \u2014 end was near. Of course we \u2014 we had \u2014 we had to push a wagon behind us so if anybody fell, that was just throw \u2018em in the wagon, so nobody was \u2014 be left on the road. And this piece of pa \u2014 they wrote these pieces of paper and they tried to give it to the persons on the end, on the edge as they were marching. Here, would you mind \u2014 would you sign this for me, and tell them that I was good to you, that I helped you, that I gave you some food. Some people did sign. I\u2019ve seen some people sign. Wha-Wha-What \u2014 what could a poor \u2014 poor soul do? In the \u2014 they never came to me personally, but I\u2019ve seen them being done. So this was the death march, so to speak a death march because lot of people were \u2014 were falling like flies. I was one of the fortunate ones, I was still strong enough because of \u2014 of the slave labor that I performed prior to that, of eating a little better. So, during this death march there was also a American Air Force air raid on a munition depot very close to a town called Wiirzburg, Germany. And from there as the \u2014 th \u2014 as the Americans were bombing, I ran and I successfully escaped. And soon after I was picked up by the United States Armed Forces.

Did you ever get over your fear of doctors and dentists? You referred to that.",
            "answer": "Unfortunately not. I \u2014 from day \u2014 from \u2014 ever since I\u2019ve been out of the \u2014 the death camps, concentration camps \u2014 when I met my wife, I got married, I had \u2014 I had problem with my teeth. You know, there \u2014 there is saying, your teeth are alright, but your gums have to come out, and that was my case, and I was deathly afraid. Once \u2014 I once ran away from a dentist in the army. I don\u2019t know if I ever s \u2014 mentioned that to \u2014 to \u2014 to the Holocaust Museum. I was taken by another \u2014 another G.I. with \u2014 to \u2014 to go to the dentist because I had awful ba-bad teeth and pain. And I was sitting in the chair and I ran away from there. I\u2019m still scared of dentists, I\u2019m still deathly afraid of shots. Pll tell you an \u2014 a little story about what happened to me a few years ago. As I mentioned to you before, I wa \u2014 I was involved in soccer, not only as a coach and a referee, but as a player. I was playing a soccer game and I got hit by a man and he opened my f\u2014 my forehead. I ended up in a hospital. And a friend of mine, the one I showed you on the picture in \u2014 in the wall there, took me to the hospital and then they called my wife to come to the hospital. They wanted to give me a tetanus shot. I would re \u2014 I refused it, I would \u2014 I fought it. My wife almost left me because of that, she was so upset with me. That tetanus shot was so important because I was hit, and also hit a door, and the hor \u2014 door had a little steel [indecipherable] I was \u2014 and doctors fear is Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 6 still there. When I go to examination, I am awfully fearful what they going to do to you. Very much so, even today. I\u2019m afraid of when they look for po \u2014 prostrate, you know, when they do th \u2014 do that little finger job on you. That scares me, that scares the hell out of me. When they take a little blood from the fingers, that scares me. So that fear is from Auschwitz, unfortunately, because I\u2019ve seen Mengele e-e-every day on th \u2014on-\u2014on the tracks. So the doctors always scare me, and they shouldn\u2019t, they really shouldn\u2019t, not today. And especially since I have a daughter who is a physician. But I\u2019m still afra \u2014 a-afraid of it. \u2019m very much so."

            "question": "Have you ever made any efforts to do anything about that? Have you \u2014",
            "answer": "N-No. See, there are two things that I am afraid of. Doctors and dentists is two, and I\u2019m also afraid of water. Water scares me for the simple reason because in Auschwitz, I was sent to a shtraf(ph) commander once. Shtraf(ph) commander meaning that they caught me es \u2014 organizing food for Jewish girls [indecipherable] commando, and they send you to a sin 0-0-operation, so they call it shtraf(ph). Sin \u2014 sin \u2014 sin commando, which meant that we were forced to cut seaweeds in water. We had a chain \u2014 chainsaw like, but with the one guy on one end of it, the other one the other end, gonna pull it, was like a sickle, which would cut it. And there would be a kapo(ph) \u2014 a\u2014a [indecipherable], a kapo(ph), a \u2014 a person who was in charge of us behind us with the SS man, and they would dunk our heads in the water and kept us there until we could not breathe any more. So I \u2014 I\u2014 I went through that for a couple of weeks as a \u2014 a-a-as a shtraf commander, as a sin [indecipherable]. So whenever \u2014 whenever we go to a USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 7 beach or something, I only go up to my knees. And not one of my children, of the four kids, were swimmers, because of me. And of course, now they are learning a little bit. Some of them are \u2014 a couple of them are still afraid. Arsani\u2019s(ph) a swimmer now, his ti\u2014 his children are a swimmer. Our daughter the physician, she swims now, she was always deathly afraid of water, because of the \u2014 because of me.

Well, when I arrived to this country, May 10\", 1946, I came from the army, so it was a little different for me than the most survivors that arrived here, because most survivors came on a diff \u2014in a\u20141-ina\u2014ina Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 8 different way. I was helped with the United States armed forces and also was very helpful that I had an aunt living in Detroit. So when I first met my wife, my future wife, we started dating, we \u2014 also a survivor, you know. She didn't have much family, I didn\u2019t have any family, so you lonely, I\u2019m lonely, let\u2019s be lonely together, the old saying what is the \u2014 one survivor said it at one time, if I may use his phrase. So when we got married, February 22\", 1948, it will be 50 years coming up in the next \u2014 th-this February, I asked my wife, why don\u2019t we \u2014 let\u2019s not talk any more any other language except English. My English was fairly decent except I had the ar-army language, which was not the cleanest language in those days, of course. That\u2019s how I learned. And we decided \u2014 she was a little bit against it. She said no, we should talk to the children other languages also. She was much smarter than me, believe me, because the kids today could have \u2014 although they speak some languages, but they could \u2014 today they could have learned much more. So, how did it affect my children? First, we wouldn\u2019t talk about our experiences. Another mistake we made \u2014 I made, anyway, it was \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m taking the blame for that. Reason we didn\u2019t want to, why hurt them? Why let them know how much we suffered, how much we went through? But the kids knew they were different. Our children soon, as soon as they started school found out they were different. Number one, they didn\u2019t have any first cousins. They didn\u2019t have any aunts and uncles. No grandparents. There was never a grandmother to \u2014 to \u2014 to hug them and kiss them or whatever. School functions, for parent and grandparents, there were never any grandparents around. We used to adopt grandparents for them. In USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 9 Detroit we use to a-adopt a lady in the apartment building. She was nice, and th \u2014 Grandma Goldstein, that was her grandma. She did \u2014 she had one daughter, an old, old maid, never married, so our children became her grandchildren. So the kids were \u2014 knew they \u2014 and yet they knew, they knew why something was wrong, but we never talked about it. The only time the kids would \u2014 our son was the first one, who was the oldest. When I joined this soccer team in Detroit, which by the way was founded by German Jews who arrived to United States in the 30\u2019s, just before Hitler got to them. And I joined this team and pretty soon \u2014 there was a tryout \u2014 pretty soon there were more survivors joining this team. So after soccer games we would go to someone\u2019s home, yours, mine or someone else\u2019s and had a cookout or dinner, or whatever. We would start talking about the game, then we would start talking about our lives in America, how \u2014 how are we doing, how much money do you make. And before you knew it, Auschwitz would come to the \u2014 to \u2014 into the \u2014 into the conversation. And our children, especially our son, would always listen from be \u2014 from behind the door. And \u2014 and he knew \u2014 he \u2014 then he would tell his sisters, you know, I just heard something about Daddy, or I heard something about Mom, about what ha \u2014 what happened to them in the camps. So we didn\u2019t want to talk about these experiences to them. And ar \u2014 then, let me tell you about the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the local Jewish population. Detroit is a big metropolitan city with a large Jewish population. We, Agnes and I, my wife Agnes went to a school to learn English. I \u2014 at the Jewish Community Center in Detroit, and our soccer team will also meet there. So, I didn\u2019t go to that school because I\u2014I-\u2014I-I Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 10 felt I\u2014 I had enough of schooling, which was another mistake. Would have listened to my wife I probably would have been sometime a teacher today somewhere. So we \u2014 then we tried to tell the local population, the local Jewish population, our \u2014 our own people in \u2014 in the Jewish Community Center. We had a Purim play, we went to a Purim play, and then all of a sudden we start talking to these people about Auschwitz, no \u2014 number of us in the soccer team. And the leader of the group says, that\u2019s enough about Auschwitz. Let\u2019s go back to singing and playing the music again. So nobody want to listen. My own aunt, may she rest in peace, my father\u2019s youngest sister, who lost everybody in her family, she lost two sisters, she lost her brother, she lost all her nieces and nephews and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and all her cousins, she wouldn\u2019t \u2014 she, coming in 1939, emigrating to this country in 1939 from Vienna, Austria, she didn\u2019t want to listen. So we decided not to talk about it. The first time I was able to talk about it was when our youngest daughter asked my wife to come to her eighth grade junior high school to speak, and the next day my wife forced me to go there. Yet, I didn\u2019t tell them a story like the story should be told. I kind of whitewashed it. I was afraid to hurt people. So that took a long time. So my children, at f\u2014 at first they were resentful, they said Daddy, why didn\u2019t you tell us? Why \u2014 you know, th \u2014 they didn\u2019t come and \u2014 and say to me, you \u2014 you \u2014 you were wrong, you \u2014 you should have done it. But you could have told us. I didn\u2019t want to hurt you honey. This \u2014 this is simple, it\u2019s a \u2014 it the 0 \u2014 it\u2019s the way it is, I'd \u2014 it just \u2014 I don\u2019t want to hurt strangers, let alone my own children. So they\u2019re different. But today they\u2019re very much involved. My daughter, the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 11 oldest one, the physician was on the Holocaust Committee with me, which I am a chairman of [indecipherable] local \u2014 local Holocaust Committee called Jewish Committee Relations. Both \u2014 all three of the daughters went to second generation meetings, second generation of Holocaust survivors. In ninete \u2014 January 27, 1985, I took two of my children, my son and my middle daughter, the New Yorker, the jeweler, with me to Auschwitz for the commemoration of the 40\" anniversary of Auschwitz being liberated, if you can call being liberated by the Soviet Union a liberation. And they came there. I showed them, first of all Auschwitz number one, that was the first camp that I was taken to. I showed them the barrack that my father was last taken to, block seven in Auschwitz, called the Krankenbau, the sick bay. Sick bay without doctors. I showed them that barrack. This is where they took my \u2014 your grandfather last time, to the ovens from. I showed them block 16 where I s \u2014 where I was living on the \u2014 which by the way, block 16 today in Auschwitz is the Czechoslovakian block, a-a-and they have some artifacts in there. And we spend there a couple da \u2014 two days in Auschwitz. And then of course in 1990, I went back again to Auschwitz, but this time I took agn \u2014 took Agnes with me, the same middle daughter and the youngest daughter. This 1s where we made a film called, \u201cAuschwitz, If You Cried, You Died.\u201d So I sh \u2014 there I really pored my heart out to my children, to show them what Auschwitz is all about, what it was all about. I took them to every \u2014 see I was working as a slave laborer, a place called Kanada commando, unloading incoming Jews from every \u2014 every Nazi occupied European country. And this is where USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 12 I gave my two daughters and my wife, who has not been to Auschwitz, their exact feeling what Auschwitz was about. I explained to them crematorium one \u2014 crematorium one, which is in Auschwitz number one, which 1s still standing. Then we went to Birkenau, which is the Auschwitz number two camp, and I showed them the crematorias(ph). I worked as a slave laborer at Birkenau, 600 yards from the gas chambers and crematorias(ph). So the kids today know much more than they should have known years ago, which I was afraid to tell them, to hurt them."

            "answer": "I found some of them that got to be interested much later. See, when I was with \u2014 picked up by the army, last days of ni \u2014 o-of March 19 twe \u2014 1945, first part of ma \u2014 April. April 6, 1945, President Roosevelt died, and I was already in with this unit. 74 \u2014 774 tank battalion, and I remember over the army radio system came the news and everybody was so hushed up about it, so you know, President Roosevelt died. That was April 6\", 1945. And by then I was getting, you know, much better. So some of the boys after the war, May 8\", 1945, some of the boys \u2014 I found a couple of Jewish boys in the sa \u2014 1n the unit. One would not eat un-kosher food, so he was given special \u2014 special food. And this guy wanted to know more, a little bit more about it, and since he found out that most of the Jews were murdered in Europe, so he started asking me the questions, so I would talk to him a little bit about it. Then, was a chaplain there also, and the chaplain would ask, but very few people really cared, because you know, here were these young boys, 19 \u2014 20 \u2014 21 years old boys away from those \u2014 4,000 miles away from their home, they would sing [sings] I'll be home for Christmas, 1945, you know. Or singing that type of song and worrying about one thing only, letters from home. Mail call was the biggest thing in the world because you were late \u2014 letter from your mom, from your girlfriend, from your brothers, from your sisters and this was the USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 26 big thing. I was a small fry. Here I was, a Jewish boy who survived concentration camps they knew nothing about. And not only they knew nothing about, some of them could care less. To them a crap game was more interesting than my story, which I didn\u2019t tell, to certain groups. I tell you, this Jewish guy, a Sephardic Jew, is a\u2014 came from a Spanish type of family, and he was very much interested. He was a religious person and he wanted to know what ha \u2014 why did the Jew \u2014 why did they do it to Jews, he would ask me. I wish I could tell you why they do it \u2014 did it to Jews. But the Jews were the one earmarked for ba \u2014 to be \u2014 to be murdered. And he was the only one that I would conver \u2014 oh, and the teacher, sorry, Feldman, who came from Boston. He was another one, he wanted to know what happened, because his parents and his grandparents came from somewhere in eastern Europe. But other than that most of them get a furlough to go to Paris to have a good time with the girls. That was the main thing. Get a weekend pass, or go to town. We were stationed then still in Germany, but on the way from Germany towards France, because this unit, 770 \u2014 774 tank battalion, these boys had enough points \u2014 and let me explain what the points were. Points were, if you served in service that such and such \u2014 long time, you were given points for each month. And if you were married and had family, that was extra points, so you could come home earlier. Now this bat-battalion, 774 tank battalion was ready to go home in September 1945. Now here they go from Germany with a convoy we going towards France. We ended up in the camp called Camp Lucky Strike. Camp Lucky Strike, the ne \u2014 Holocaust Museum has a photograph of me in the USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 27 Camp Lucky Strike, in a tent picture, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m in a tent over there. Outside a tent, I\u2019m sorry. And now we come to LaHavre, France. And here\u2019s an interesting story. I\u2019m sure I told this to the Holocaust Museum, but I\u2019m going to repeat it if I \u2014 1f I did, so I\u2019]l repeat it. LaHavre, France was an embarkation, it was the \u2014 this ab \u2014 th \u2014 where the camp \u2014 embarkation camp, this is where you got on ships to go back home. Now here is my unit going on a ship called Lieutenant Colonel James Barker. That\u2019s the troop carrier. The na \u2014 that ship is named after this colonel. Now they don\u2019t know what to do with me. They wanted to put me on a ship, and I\u2019m ready to go. I would be going on the ship with them to go to United States. Well, Captain Yogerling(ph), who is an attorney from home says, we\u2019re gonna get him in trouble. What they wanted to do, the other captain wanted to do, take him \u2014 go into Boston, to \u2014 tha-that was our \u2014 the \u2014 they would stop in Boston, we would get discharged in Boston, get our \u2014 get our papers in Boston, and then leave for Boston. Get our papers and everything else. Discharge papers. Well, Captain Yogerling(ph) felt 1f I\u2019m going to be put on a ship \u2014 the other captain said, let\u2019s take him on with us, put him on the ship and when we get to Boston, turning him in to the authorities, to immigration office, and tell them he\u2019s got an aunt here he \u2014 he can go to his aunt. Now, Captain Yogerling(ph), who is an attorney from home, this is nuts, this is illegal entry to United States and he will be punished, he will \u2014 he will be sent \u2014 sent back to where \u2014 wherever they send him back. So Captain Yogerling(ph) decided un \u2014 took me on a Jeep, with my duffle bag \u2014 and the guys collected money. The \u2014 the \u2014 my group, company A, which I was with, USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 28 they collected dollars to give me, you know, to \u2014 so I have some money with me. They took me \u2014 Captain Yogerling(ph) drove me to Camp Home Run, which was \u2014 that was the name of the camp, which was an embarkation camp, but I\u2019m going to tell you what the camp meant \u2014 may be an embarkation. Replacement troops. This is what the troops will be coming to replace the troops that went home. And I went to the Camp Home Run, the Captain Yogerling(ph) took me with him, took me to the camp commander. And the camp commander kind of welcomed me, they got \u2014 they stuck me with the name Chesskey(ph), you know, that was the \u2014 that was given to me already by this unit. Captain Yogerling(ph) said that\u2019s what they call him, Chesskey(ph). So I got into this camp, and what I be gi \u2014 what kind of job they give me? To be in charge of a officer\u2019s dry cleaning and laundry, manned by German prisoners, all right? First thing the captain of \u2014 of \u2014 of Home Run, Captain Home Run tells me who was in charge of us in that area. He says to me, Chesskey(ph), you\u2019re going to be working, you\u2019re going to be in charge of this laundry. Now, there are German prisoners there. We didn\u2019t come here to make concentration camps, we came here to bring democracy. And that\u2019s what it was. I was there, I was sworn into the United States Armed Forces at Camp Home Run with another fellow, whose name is also misspelled on the list you have, whose name was Raymond Delafonte(ph) Quinones(ph). He was a Spaniard, not Jewish. Now we sworn into United States Armed Forces. However, it was a wrong form, a regular army form. United States has two armies. Army of United States and regular army. Well, the colonel who swore us Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 29 in tipped [indecipherable] over it and put down Army of United States, sent it to the war department of Washington. Oh, I would say a couple of months later, came back disapproved. Attached new forms to re-sign. In the meanwhile, my aunt was found in Detroit, Michigan. There was a Jewish chaplain whose na \u2014 are also from Chicago, in Camp Home Run, whose name was Michael Lipschitz(ph), and Michael Lipschitz(ph), I to \u2014 showed him I f\u2014 my aunt was found too, by the Red Cross and by the army, what do I do? He went to the colonel, the company \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 th-the \u2014 the \u2014 the camp commander and he told him the story, so I didn\u2019t have to re-sign. Raymond Dellafonta(ph) Quinones(ph), soon as he signed the new papers, was shipped to South Pacific. And this what would happen to me. Now waiting for my aunt papers to come, and the army papers came, the army gave me referral to go to Czechoslovakia go pick up some passports and \u2014 and \u2014 an-and birth certificates. But sha \u2014 never got a birth certificate. Passport I bought in \u2014 in Paris at the Czech embassy, and I came to this \u2014 and that\u2019s how I came to United States."

And I was asked, the third time I testified, what would you like that should happen, you know, cause otherwi \u2014 I knew I testi \u2014 because there was other people testifying. But they brought 17 guys to testify against him. 17 former prisoners. Not one of us meet each other \u2014 met each other.

One guy at a time. So I was asked by one of the judges, how would I \u2014 what would \u2014 what would I feel that should happen here? After all, with your testimony the man should be sentenced. Well, I said, I really don\u2019t care if you sentence him. I just want one thing from you people. If this man will be willing to do what I\u2019m doing. I speak about my experiences as a Holocaust survivor. I go to colleges, universities, high schools, civic, religious organizations. Let him come with me. Let him tell his \u2014 his story about what he did in Auschwitz for the 18 months that I knew him on the ramps.

That would be enough of a sentence for me. And that\u2019s the kind of sentence I was hoping the masses of the Nazis would get. The masses, in every German community.

I followed orders. Well, tell me why did you followed orders? You tell this to your community, in front of a survivor who is mentally and physically able to testify. That is what I am saying them \u2014 should happen to the masses. Not once of all these times I testified did I walk out of the courtrooms with a lighter heart, just satisfied that something was done, because there wasn\u2019t.

That was \u2014 they had two, two things. One, the worst film. Second, it had the best thing. It got the attention of the pub \u2014 the general public. Well, this is what the general public now wants today. Holocaust is a very fashionable thing, not only because of Spielberg, because of Shoah, and any \u2014 any piece of \u2014 USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 54 documentary on Holocaust, true or not true \u2014 I-I shouldn\u2019t say not true, accurate or almost inaccurate, it has some affect on people.

Oh yeah, lot of s \u2014 lot of our population wouldn\u2019t want to hear that. They won\u2019t listen to it. Not because they don\u2019t want to hear, but because they don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2014 that should be done. I-In Germany nobody wanted to do it. Listen, his book, hi \u2014 \u201cHitler\u2019s Willing Executioners\u201d was the biggest seller in Germany. He drew more crowd in Germany when he was lecturing there, and there was boycotts there. Yet, this is what the people should hear. You know, pretty soon there won\u2019t be any survivors left. We\u2019re getting to be old people. Now, I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I consider myself still one of the younger guys, but at the same time, every day you got less and less \u2014 there\u2019s less and less of us around. A-A-Auschwitz will only be a legend. Now who\u2019s gonna \u2014 other than the Holocaust Museum which I\u2019m doing today, which I did in 1989 for the Holocaust Museum, who 1s going to be here? Just this. There won\u2019t be a living person to be able to say things like I say, or like other survivors who are capable of talking. So these guys should go out there and do that. And let me tell you, they would have a great audience. Very \u2014 there are so many people that are hungry to know why it happened, because ho \u2014 there are not that many of us that go to schools and colleges and universities. You know, some of us are getting so old that we \u2014 we \u2014 we fantasize. You know, some people fantasize and I get very upset with it, you know.

When I first found out that Steven Spielberg is going to make the Schindler stor \u2014 \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d at first I was wondering. I says, here is a guy who Is going to make a Holocaust movie. He is a man who made \u201cE.T,\u201d what is he going to do with the Holocaust? You know, he\u2019s got Indiana Jones and \u201cE.T.\u201d Well, when the \u2014 \u2018\u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d came to town, here to Indianapolis, I was invited as a Holocaust survivor to be there for special presentations, and I went.

And I walked out of there really almost satisfied that he did a good job. If he\u2019d shown any more atrocities than he showed in the film, I don\u2019t think people could have sit through it. Some of it was a little schmaltzy. I was a little bit \u2014 you know, I watched it so closely. When Oskar Schindler said at the end, I should have done more, I should have done this, I should have that, I \u2014 I\u2019d\u2014I didn\u2019t do enough, I should have saved more people, those words, well that was a little schmaltzy to me, you know. Th-That \u2014 Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 57 that \u2014 that they could have left out. Yes, Oskar Schindler did help. There\u2019s 5,000 survivors of that group that are alive today because of him. You know, 5,000 members of the families that came la \u2014 after. So that \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 1t was fairly \u2014 done fairly decent. But the other ones, I don\u2019t remember of any other one, other than Sobibor, \u201cEscape From Sobibor,\u201d I\u2019m sorry, that was done because they found people that survived Sobibor and these were the people that helped, same as Oskar Schindler got the \u2014 got the book from a \u2014 from a \u2014 from the luggage store in \u2014 in L.A. and here\u2019s these guys from th \u2014 Long Island, New York who were Sobibor survivors, they helped with the movie.

And he says to him, I know a guy from that town, too \u2014 my friend from Richmond told him. He says, he lives in the States. So the guy says, I know who, Mike Vogel. Mike Vogel saved my life at Auschwitz. That\u2019s the guy I told you about. So here\u2019s a guy, pitches salt, grain of salt like Zyklon B gas into these people. So you see, Nazism, some of these animals, when \u2014 when someone shows, \u201cHitler\u2019s Willing Executioners,\u201d or someone goes there for this type of a purpose, they\u2019re still fighting it.

Not too many did it, cause if there were so many Righteous Gentiles, why else \u2014 if there were so many, why so many of us died, why so many was killed. Let me tell you my own personal experiment \u2014 experience with what you just asked me. First part of 1942, I was in a slave labor camp in Slovakia called Novaky. There was a good friend of mine whose name was Josef Knap(ph), Kanap(ph) in Slovak, Knap(ph). Josef Knap(ph) had a Christian girlfriend, name was Terri(ph) \u2014 Therese \u2014 ter \u2014 terra \u2014 terries \u2014 Th-Therese. Him and I escaped together from Novaky. He knew his way pretty well, he was about a year and a half older than me. We get to our hometown, Topol\u2019\u20acany, his \u2014 her father had a small farm on the outskirts of our city and we two boys, escapees, going the back doors, back ways so we will get picked up by this \u2014 by the gendarmes, by the police of our town. Came to Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 75 this house hoping that I would be able to hide there too. Well, the father of the girl, father of Therese, the father said, I\u2019m taking Josef in my house and hide him, but I\u2019m not taking a chance with two Jews in my house. And here I am, stuck out on the outskirt of our town, got picked up by police as I was walking back to town, beat the hell out of me, send me back to Novaky. In 1946 I went back to Slovakia wi \u2014 through the army because I went to get my papers and those two are still married, of course, they had a child. And she cried. She apologized to me that her father wouldn\u2019t take me. Her father died since, but he wouldn\u2019t take me. So \u2014 but as fate would have it, I survived, she says, so at least I came to see them. Josef Knap(ph) died, let\u2019s see, 1990 I was in Israel and there was a Czechoslovakian gathering of Holocaust survivors, and there was another Jew \u2014 Jewish person there who travels from \u2014 to my hometown and he told me that he died a few months ago. So the Righteous Gentiles really weren\u2019t that many. As far as the guy said he wouldn\u2019t do it, I believe it, because most people didn\u2019t want to do it. My father had enough Christian friends and people that he dealt with, people that he sold horses and cattle to, that somebody could have saved us. Nobody was willing."

I'll tell you another story. In 1961 we lived in Cleveland, Ohio. I was working for a company called Shoppers Fair. I was straightening out a couple of shelves in the store with my sleeves \u2014 short sleeve shirt on. A guy walks in, he says, you got number. I know man got number. Talks with an accent. I said oh yeah, you do? Okay. I bring him here. Next day he drags in a gu \u2014 brings in a guy, we were together in Auschwitz. This guy\u2019s name was Mutti(ph) Klein(ph). He worked with my father with the horses at Auschwitz. We became f\u2014 of course, close friends until we moved to Cleveland, he \u2014 they \u2014 a-and \u2014 USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 81 and he eva \u2014 a-a-after awhile he got a heart attack. Then he retired in Florida. In 1990 we went to Israel ag-again for the gathering, and he didn't make it because he was ill. And there I met some people that know him also because they came the same time as we did to Auschwitz. We got home to Indianapolis, we found out a few months later he died. So that was also through his number because the guy seen me at work, stocking shelves at Shoppers Fair. So the number 1s always there and always comes up in the conversation wherever I go. And when I went to Germany to test \u2014 testify, I made it a point when we were free from court, and we went for train rides and went \u2014 anywhere we went, I would always [indecipherable] summertime, of course we were there summertime, I would sit there \u2014 and always would like to sit close to an older German, just to let him see the number. And they would look at you, then they put the head down and never look at you again. Probably couldn't get a \u2014 couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t wait to get off the next stop.

The coldest, rainiest day you can imagine, it was so cold. And we \u2014 we said, it fits the occasion, the oc \u2014 the opening fits the occasion. Three of our kids came with us, two daughters and a son and my wife and I. And I was written up in the U.S. \u2014 the U.S.A. today in the \u2014 because of the opening. And this was too, very, very emotional. The \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the demonstrators, they \u2014 the park police, of course, took care of them after awhile. They had demonstrators up to a point and after that they took care of them.

And of course, it was so emotional. But the \u201981 in Israel, that is where I met Kulka and met some other people, a couple guys from France who worked with me in the Kanada commando. And then \u2014 that was the hardest part. That was the \u2014 that was the hardest part for me. When at Yad Vashem we heard a first speech by a \u2014 the le \u2014 one of the leaders of the group, and man there wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the place. This is when I really cried, when they start talking, my number is such and such. And then you walked through the Yad Vashem Museum where all the photographs of \u2014 original photographs of Nazis that t \u2014 took \u2014 the documentation, Nazi documentation took. As I walked through, I\u2019ve seen the railroad tracks where I worked. And I\u2019ve seen the prisoners whom I knew and I point \u2014 could point out who they were. And that broke me down. And NPR was there, she interviewed me, a lady interviewed me, I couldn\u2019t finish the interview, that\u2019s how bad I was. That was very, very emotional. And we went \u2014 since then, of course, we went to a few more gathering \u2014 Holocaust gathering. I had the great honor, because of the Holocaust Museum and the Holocaust organization, May eighth, this past May eighth, be invited to Washington, D.C. at the capital rotunda to do the Holocaust Memorial Kaddish. So I did May eighth in Washington, which was also very beautiful."

Hoover is fighting communists too, that\u2019s good. But neither one of these guys were good a \u2014 good Americans, so to speak, because they were hate mongers. Hoover, what did he do? He went after the wrong people all the time, you know. Martin Luther King. What did he want from Martin Luther King? Here was a man who was a peaceful demonstrator. He pi \u2014 th \u2014 he th \u2014 he never wanted to throw a rock on anybody, he didn\u2019t do any of that, he was very peaceful. He put him to jail, he put him to jail, and he was nicely quiet, with his good voice, telling the world what it\u2019s all about. McCarthy was just as bad as the Nazis. He went after people whom he consider \u2014 whom he \u2014 whom he accused of being a communist. He took so many lives away from people \u2014 so many livelihoods away from people in \u2014 in \u2014 in those years. He was the \u2014 one of the worst thing \u2014 he was an animal."
