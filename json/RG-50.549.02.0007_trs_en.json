But as we were marching with these Wehrmacht guards, from the lans \u0152 last concentration camp, which was a subcamp of Dachau, Landsberg, we were supposedly marching towards the Tyrolean mountains, and they knew the ne \u0152 end was near. Of c ourse we \u0152 we had \u0152 we had to push a wagon behind us so if anybody fell, that was just throw \u201aem in the wagon, so nobody was \u0152 be left on the road . And this piece of pa \u0152 they wrote these pieces of paper and they tried to give it to the persons on the end, on the edge as they were marching. Here, would you mind \u0152 would you sign this for me, and tell them that I was good to you, that I helped you, that I gave you some food. Some people did sign. I\u2122ve seen some people sign. Wha-Wha-What \u0152 what could a poor \u0152 poor soul do? In the \u0152 they never came to me personally, but I\u2122ve seen them being done. So this was the death march, so to speak a death march because lot of people were \u0152 were falling like flies. I was one of the fortunate ones, I was still strong enough because of \u0152 of the slave labor that I performed prior to that, of eating a little better. So, during this death march there was also a American Air Force air raid on a munition depot very close to a town called W\u00fcrzburg, Germany. And from there as the \u0152 th \u0152 as the Americans were bombing, I ran and I successfully escape d. And soon after I was picked up by the United States Armed Forces.

Did you ever get over your fear of doctors and dentists? You referred to that.",
            "answer": "Unfortunately not. I \u0152 from day \u0152 from \u0152 ever since I\u2122ve been out of the \u0152 the death camps, concentration camps \u0152 when I met my wife, I got married, I had \u0152 I had problem with my teeth. You know, there \u0152 there is saying, your teeth are alright, but your gums have to come out, and that was my case, and I was deathly afraid. Once \u0152 I once ran away from a dentist in the army. I don\u2122t know if I ever s \u0152 mentioned that to \u0152 to \u0152 to the Holocaust Museum. I was taken by another \u0152 another G.I. with \u0152 to \u0152 to go to the dentist because I had awful ba-bad teeth and pain. And I was sitting in the chair and I ran away from there. I\u2122m still scared of dentists, I\u2122m still deathly afraid of shots. I\u2122ll tell you an \u0152 a little story about what happened to me a few years ago. As I mentioned to you before, I wa \u0152 I was involved in soccer, not only as a coach and a referee, but as a player. I was playing a soccer game and I got hit by a man and he opened my f \u0152 my forehead. I ended up in a hospital. And a friend of mine, the one I showed you on the picture in \u0152 in the wall there, took me to the hospital and then they called my wife to come to the hospital. They wanted to give me a tetanus shot. I would re \u0152 I refused it, I would \u0152 I fought it. My wife almost left me because of that, she was so upset with me. That tetanus shot was so important because I was hit, and also hit a door, and the hor \u0152 door had a little steel [indecipherable] I was \u0152 and doctors fear is USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 6still there. When I go to examination, I am awfully fearful what they going to do to you. Very much so, even today. I\u2122m afraid of when they look for po \u0152 prostrate, you know, when they do th \u0152 do that little finger job on you. That scares me, that scares the hell out of me. When they take a little blood fr om the fingers, that scares me. So that fear is from Auschwitz, unfortunately, because I\u2122ve seen Mengele e-e-every day on th \u0152 on \u0152 on the tracks. So the doctors always scare me, and they shouldn\u2122t, they really shouldn\u2122t, not today. And especially since I have a daughter who is a physician. But I\u2122m still afra \u0152 a-afraid of it. I\u2122m very much so."

            "question": "Have you ever made any efforts to do anything about that? Have you \u0152",
            "answer": "N-No. See, there are two things that I am afraid of. Doctors and dentists is two, and I\u2122m also afraid of water. Water scares me for the simple reason because in Auschwitz , I was sent to a shtraf(ph) commander once. Shtraf(ph) commander meaning that they caught me es \u0152 organizing food for Jewish girls [indecipherable] commando, and they send you to a sin o-o-operation, so they call it shtraf(ph). Sin \u0152 sin \u0152 sin commando, which meant that we were forced to cut seaweeds in water. We had a chain \u0152 chainsaw like, but with the one guy on one end of it, the other one the other end, gonna pull it, was like a sickle, which would cut it. And there would be a kapo (ph) \u0152 a \u0152 a [indecipherable] , a kapo(ph), a \u0152 a person who was in charge of us behind us with the SS man, and they would dunk our heads in the water and kept us there until we could not breathe any more. So I \u0152 I \u0152 I went through that for a couple of weeks as a \u0152 a-a-as a shtraf commander, as a sin [indecipherable] . So whenever \u0152 whenever we go to a USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 7beach or something, I only go up to my knees. And not one of my children, of the four kids, were swimmers, because of me. And of course, now they are learning a little bit. Some of them are \u0152 a couple of them are still afraid. Arsani\u2122s(ph) a swimmer now, his ti \u0152 his children are a swimmer. Our daughter the physician, she swims now, she was always deathly afraid of water, because of the \u0152 because of me. So those are the things that scare me, scare the hell out of me, doctors, dentists and water."

            "answer": "All right, let\u2122s \u0152 the children, our children. Well, when I arrived to this country, May 10th, 1946, I came from the army, so it was a little different for me than the most survivors that arrived here, because most survivors came on a diff \u0152 in a \u0152 i-in a \u0152 in a USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 8different way. I was helped with the United States armed forces and also was very helpful that I had an aunt living in Detroit. So when I first met my wife, my future wife, we started dating, we \u0152 also a survivor, you know. She didn't have much family, I didn\u2122t have any family, so you lonely, I\u2122m lonely, let\u2122s be lonely together, the old saying what is the \u0152 one survivor said it at one time, if I may use his phrase. So when we got married, February 22 nd, 1948, it will be 50 years coming up in the next \u0152 th-this February, I asked my wife, why don\u2122t we \u0152 let\u2122s not talk any more any other language except English. My English was fairly decent except I had the ar-army language, which was not the cleanest language in those days, of course. That\u2122s how I learned. And we decided \u0152 she was a little bit against it. She said no, we should talk to the children other languages also. She was much smarter than me, believe me, because the kids today could have \u0152 alth ough they speak some languag es, but they could \u0152 today they could have learned much more. So, ho w did it affect my children? First, we wouldn\u2122t talk about our experiences. Another mistake we made \u0152 I made, anyway, it was \u0152 I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m taking the bl ame for that. Reason we didn\u2122t want to, why hurt them? Why let them know how much we suffered, how much we went through? But the kids knew they were different. Our children soon, as soon as they started school found out they were different. Number one, they didn\u2122t have any first cousins. They didn\u2122t have any aunts and uncles. No gran dparents. There was never a grandmother to \u0152 to \u0152 to hug them and kiss them or whatever. School functions, for parent and grandparents, there were never any grandparents around. We used to adopt grandparents for them. In USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 9Detroit we use to a-adopt a lady in the apartment building. She was nice, and th \u0152 Grandma Goldstein, that was her grandma. Sh e did \u0152 she had one daughter, an old, old maid, never married, so our children became her grandchildren. So the kids were \u0152 knew they \u0152 and yet they knew, they knew why something was wr ong, but we never talked about it. The only time the kids would \u0152 our son wa s the first one, who was the oldest. When I joined this soccer team in Detroit, which by the way was founded by German Jews who arrived to United States in the 30\u2122s, just before Hitler got to them. And I joined this team and pr etty soon \u0152 there was a tryout \u0152 pretty soon there were more survivors joining this team. So after soccer games we would go to someone\u2122s home, yours, mine or someone else\u2122s and had a cookout or dinner, or whatever. We would start talking about the game, then we would start talking about our lives in America, how \u0152 how are we doing, how mu ch money do you make . And before you knew it, Auschwitz would come to the \u0152 to \u0152 into the \u0152 into the conversation. And our children, especially our son, would always listen from be \u0152 from behind the door. And \u0152 and he knew \u0152 he \u0152 then he would tell his sisters, you know, I just heard something about Daddy, or I heard something about Mom, about what ha \u0152 what happened to them in the camps. So we didn\u2122t want to talk about these experiences to them. And ar \u0152 then, let me tell you about the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the local Jewish population. Detroit is a big metropolitan city with a large Jewish population. We, Agnes and I, my wife Agnes went to a school to learn English. I \u0152 at the Jewish Community Center in Detroit, and our soccer team will also meet there. So, I didn\u2122t go to that school because I \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 10felt I \u0152 I had enough of schooling, which wa s another mistake. Would have listened to my wife I probably would ha ve been sometime a teacher today somewhere. So we \u0152 then we tried to tell the local population, the local Jewish population, our \u0152 our own people in \u0152 in the Jewish Community Center. We had a Purim play, we went to a Purim play, and then all of a sudden we start talking to these people about Auschwitz, no \u0152 number of us in the soccer team. And th e leader of the group says, that\u2122s enough about Auschwitz. Let\u2122s go back to singing and play ing the music again. So nobody want to listen. My own aunt, may she rest in peace, my father\u2122s youngest sister, who lost everybody in her family, she lost two si sters, she lost her brother, she lost all her nieces and nephews and \u0152 and \u0152 and \u0152 and all her cousins, she wouldn\u2122t \u0152 she, coming in 1939, emigrating to this country in 1939 from Vienna, Austria, she didn\u2122t want to listen. So we decided not to talk about it. The first time I was able to talk about it was when our youngest daughter asked my wife to come to her eighth grade junior high school to speak, and the next day my wife fo rced me to go there. Yet, I didn\u2122t tell them a story like the story should be told. I kind of whitewashed it. I was afraid to hurt people. So that took a long time. So my children, at f \u0152 at first they were resentful, they said Daddy, why didn\u2122t you te ll us? Why \u0152 you know, th \u0152 they didn\u2122t come and \u0152 and say to me, you \u0152 you \u0152 you we re wrong, you \u0152 you should ha ve done it. But you could have told us. I didn\u2122t want to hurt you honey. This \u0152 this is simple, it\u2122s a \u0152 it the o \u0152 it\u2122s the way it is, I\u2122d \u0152 it just \u0152 I don\u2122t want to hurt strangers, let alone my own children. So they\u2122re different. But today they\u2122re very much involved. My daughter, the USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 11oldest one, the physician was on the Ho locaust Committee with me, which I am a chairman of [indecipherable] local \u0152 local Holocaust Committee called Jewish Committee Relations. Both \u0152 all three of the daughters went to second generation meetings, second generation of Holocaust su rvivors. In ninete \u0152 January 27, 1985, I took two of my children, my son and my middle daughter, the New Yorker, the jeweler, with me to Auschwitz for the commemoration of the 40 th anniversary of Auschwitz being liberated, if you can call being liberated by the Soviet Union a liberation. And they came there. I showed them, first of all Auschwitz number one, that was the first camp that I was taken to. I showed them the barrack that my father was last taken to, block seven in Auschwitz, called the Krankenbau, the sick bay. Sick bay without doctors. I showed them that barrack. This is where they took my \u0152 your grandfather last time, to the ovens from. I showed them block 16 where I s \u0152 where I was living on the \u0152 which by the way, block 16 today in Auschwitz is the Czechoslovakian block, a-a-and they have so me artifacts in there. And we spend there a couple da \u0152 two days in Auschwitz . And then of course in 1990, I went back again to Auschwitz, but this time I took agn \u0152 took Agnes with me, the same middle daughter and the youngest daughter. This is where we made a film called, \ufb01Auschwitz, If You Cried, You Died.\ufb02 So I sh \u0152 there I really pored my heart out to my children, to show them what Auschwitz is all about, what it wa s all about. I took them to every \u0152 see I was working as a slave laborer, a place called Kanada commando, unloading incoming Jews from every \u0152 every Nazi occupi ed European country. And this is where USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 12I gave my two daughters and my wife, who has not been to Auschwitz , their exact feeling what Auschwitz was about. I explained to them crematorium one \u0152 crematorium one, which is in Auschwitz number one, which is st ill standing. Then we went to Birkenau , which is the Auschwitz number two camp, and I showed them the crematorias(ph). I worked as a slave laborer at Birkenau, 600 yards from the gas chambers and crematorias(ph). So the kids today know mu ch more than they should have known years ago, which I was a fraid to tell them, to hurt them."

Or singing that type of song and wo rrying about one thing only, letters from home. Mail call was the biggest thing in the world because you were late \u0152 letter from your mom, from your girlfriend, from your brothers, from your sisters and this was the USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 26big thing. I was a small fry. Here I was, a Jewish boy who survived concentration camps they knew nothing about. And not only they knew nothing about, some of them could care less. To them a crap game was more interesting than my story, which I didn\u2122t tell, to certain groups. I tell you, this Jewish guy, a Sephardic Jew, is a \u0152 came from a Spanish type of family, and he was very much interested. He was a religious person and he wanted to know what ha \u0152 why did the Jew \u0152 why did they do it to Jews, he would ask me. I wish I could tell you why they do it \u0152 did it to Jews. But the Jews were the one earmarked for ba \u0152 to be \u0152 to be murdered. And he was the only one that I would conver \u0152 oh, and the teacher, sorry, Feldman , who came from Boston. He was another one, he wanted to know what happened, because his parents and his grandparents came from somewhere in eastern Europe . But other than that most of them get a furlough to go to Paris to have a good time with the girls. That was the main thing. Get a weekend pass, or go to town. We were stationed then still in Germany, but on the way from Germany towards France, because this unit, 770 \u0152 774 tank battalion, these boys had enough points \u0152 and let me explain what the points were. Points were, if you served in service that such and such \u0152 long time, you were given points for each month. And if you were married and had family, that was extra points, so you could come home earlier. No w this bat-battalion, 774 tank battalion was ready to go home in September 1945. Now here they go from Germany with a convoy we going towards France . We ended up in the camp called Camp Lucky Strike . Camp Lucky Strike , the ne \u0152 Holocaust Museum ha s a photograph of me in the USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 27Camp Lucky Strike , in a tent picture, I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m in a tent over there. Outside a tent, I\u2122m sorry. And now we come to LaHavre, France. And here\u2122s an interesting story. I\u2122m sure I told this to the Holocaust Museum, but I\u2122m going to repeat it if I \u0152 if I did, so I\u2122ll repeat it. LaHavre, France was an embarkation, it was the \u0152 this ab \u0152 th \u0152 where the camp \u0152 embarkation camp, this is where you got on ships to go back home. Now here is my unit going on a ship called Lieutenant Colonel James Barker. That\u2122s the troop carrier. The na \u0152 that ship is named after this colonel. Now they don\u2122t know what to do with me. They wanted to put me on a ship, and I\u2122m ready to go. I would be going on the ship w ith them to go to United States. Well, Captain Yogerling(ph), who is an attorney from home says, we\u2122re gonna get him in trouble. What they wanted to do, the other captain wanted to do, take him \u0152 go into Boston, to \u0152 tha-that was our \u0152 the \u0152 they would stop in Boston, we would get discharged in Boston , get our \u0152 get our papers in Boston , and then leave for Boston . Get our papers and everything else. Discharge papers. Well, Captain Yogerling(ph) felt if I\u2122m going to be put on a ship \u0152 the other captain said, let\u2122s take him on with us, put him on the sh ip and when we get to Boston , turning him in to the authorities, to immigration office, and tell them he\u2122s got an aunt here he \u0152 he can go to his aunt. Now, Captain Yogerling (ph), who is an attorney from home, this is nuts, this is illegal entry to United States and he will be punished, he will \u0152 he will be sent \u0152 sent back to where \u0152 wherever they send him back. So Captain Yogerling(ph) decided un \u0152 took me on a Jeep, with my duffle bag \u0152 and the guys collected money. The \u0152 the \u0152 my group, company A, which I was with, USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 28they collected dollars to give me, you know, to \u0152 so I have some money with me. They took me \u0152 Captain Yogerling(ph) drove me to Camp Home Run, which was \u0152 that was the name of the camp, which was an embarkation camp, but I\u2122m going to tell you what the camp meant \u0152 may be an embarkation. Replacement troops. This is what the troops will be coming to replace the troops that went home. And I went to the Camp Home Run, the Captain Yogerling(ph) took me with him, took me to the camp commander. And the camp commander kind of welcomed me, they got \u0152 they stuck me with the name Chesskey(ph), you know, that was the \u0152 that was given to me already by this unit. Captain Yogerling(ph) said that\u2122s what they call him, Chesskey(ph). So I got into this camp, and what I be gi \u0152 what kind of job they give me? To be in charge of a officer\u2122s dry cleaning and laundry, manned by German prisoners, all right? First thing the captain of \u0152 of \u0152 of Home Run, Captain Home Run tells me who was in charge of us in that area. He says to me, Chesskey(ph), you\u2122re going to be working, you\u2122re going to be in charge of this laundry. Now, there are German prisoners there. We didn\u2122t come here to make concentration camps, we came here to bring democracy. And that\u2122s what it was. I was there, I was sworn into the United States Armed Forces at Camp Home Run with another fellow, whose name is also misspelled on the list you have, whose name was Raymond Delafonte (ph) Quinones(ph). He was a Spaniard, not Jewish. Now we sworn into United States Armed Forces. However, it was a wr ong form, a regular army form. United States has two armies. Army of United States and regular army. Well, the colonel who swore us USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 29in tipped [indecipherable] over it and put down Army of United States, sent it to the war department of Washington. Oh, I would say a couple of months later, came back disapproved. Attached new forms to re-sign. In the meanwhile, my aunt was found in Detroit, Michigan. There was a Jewish chaplain whose na \u0152 are also from Chicago, in Camp Home Run, whose name was Michael Lipschitz(ph), and Michael Lipschitz(ph), I to \u0152 showed him I f \u0152 my aunt was found too, by the Red Cross and by the army, what do I do? He went to the co lonel, the company \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 th-the \u0152 the \u0152 the camp commander and he told him the story, so I didn\u2122t have to re-sign. Raymond Dellafonta(ph) Quinones (ph), soon as he signed the new papers, was shipped to South Pacific. And this what would happen to me. Now waiting for my aunt papers to come, and the army papers came, the army gave me referral to go to Czechoslovakia go pick up some passports and \u0152 and \u0152 an-and birth certificates. But sha \u0152 never got a birth certific ate. Passport I bought in \u0152 in Paris at the Czech embassy, and I came to this \u0152 and that\u2122s how I came to United States."

Never lost that I was born to a Jewish family. I was born to a G od fearing Jewish family in easter \u0152 in Europe , in ch \u0152 in Slovakia . In fact, I was quite religious, for a number of years. When I got to Auschwitz I still had belief in religion, a belief in God, but I soon lost that. If God wanted to punish us Jews, if we did something that te rribly wrong, punish us for a day, a week or three da \u0152 whatever. But let us suffer from 1939 in Slovakia , in Poland , in Ukraine, in all the other European countries, from 1939 til 1945, let us being systematically murdered, thrown into the ovens. And me, working the ga \u0152 working that railroad tracks, and seeing that with my own eyes, knowing what these mass of thousands upon thousands of peop le were being herded like sheep, not knowing where they\u2122re going, I have an anger with God. I have a problem with God. If it wouldn\u2122t be for Agnes , I probably would never stepped in a temple, my foot in a USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 43temple. She says, we have children, we have to do something. We have to let them \u0152 let them do, and then when they get older let them \u0152 let them lead their own way, but teach \u0152 show them the way first. Well, we did that. Our son was Bar Mitzvah, our little \u0152 our young \u0152 oldest daughter was Bat Mitzvahed, the other two weren\u2122t. But I still when I go to the temple I feel like \u0152 like a hypocrite. Where was God for three years, letting this happen, the systematic destruction of every Jew in Europe? That\u2122s my anger with God. You know, in Yiddish there \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 there\u2122s a saying, Ehob tsores wich hemas borach (ph). I\u2122ve got troubles with God, problems with God.

So I, being a sarcastic with a sick sense of humor, well why didn\u2122t God choose somebody else for this? Why were we chosen to be burned and gassed? So th-t h-this is my anger. I don\u2122t have an ounce of hate in me. Anger is not hate, because if you hate, you die inside.

We were all lined up in a roll call place, standing sc \u0152 clean, with clean uniforms. They cleaned up the camp. You know what the cleaned up camp meant? They took all the prisoners who were looking like skeletons, or half skeletons, got them away from there, right in the ovens. Showered us, so you can call the showers. Gave us clean stripes. And they would bring forward \u0152 they would talk to \u0152 they would put the best looking guys forward, standing forward, and they would let them talk to somebody. How are you treated?

Hans Kunneman (ph) was then already USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 51training to be an opera singer, okay?

Course we meet in Chicago at the ger \u0152 German consulate \u0152 the German consulate on Michigan Avenue , so when? It\u2122s like day after Thanksgiving. So I go over there for Chicago, they bought me a flight ticket or whatever, I\u2122m in a hotel and I get there. I testify all day, from nine o\u2122clock in the morning to break for lunch, til six o\u2122clock in the evening. He opens up a book of photographs then, not today, then photographs with the uniforms and everything on. Identify this man on three different photog raphs, plus three other Nazis who also worked in the same position. Then I was taken to Germany following summer with my wife. Identified them over there just as easy. This a \u0152 this was a tribunal. Eight judge tribunal, not a \u0152 not a \u0152 a \u0152 a jury trial. I had a interpreter, and the \u0152 and the German attorney sitting next to me. There was Kunneman(ph) sitting, he had a court appointed doctor with him, he claimed to be very sick, and these eight judges. And I\u2122m testifying and testifying. And I was asked, the third time I testified, what would you like that should happen, you know, cause othe rwi \u0152 I knew I testi \u0152 because there was other people testifying. But they brought 17 guys to testify against him. 17 former prisoners. Not one of us meet each other \u0152 met each other. You came on the Saturday, stayed for three days and then you went to court, then you left, then the other guys USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 52came on a Saturday. One guy at a time. So I was asked by one of the judges, how would I \u0152 what would \u0152 what would I feel that should happen here? After all, with your testimony the man should be sentenced. Well, I said, I really don\u2122t care if you sentence him. I just want one thing from you people. If this man will be willing to do what I\u2122m doing. I speak about my experiences as a Holocaust survivor. I go to colleges, universities, high schools, civic, religious organizations. Let him come with me. Let him tell his \u0152 his st ory about what he did in Auschwitz for the 18 months that I knew him on the ramps. For the 18 months that he would direct people, select people to the gas chambers or to slave labor. Let him tell what he did and I\u2122ll tell mals \u0152 my story. The two of us together. That would be enough of a sentence for me. And that\u2122s the kind of sentence I was hoping the masses of the Nazis would get. The masses, in every German community. They should be taken to co urt with so \u0152 Holocaust survivors to be there and talk about it and tell them and force them to \u0152 to admit that not I followed orders like \u0152 like I was to ld, to do \u0152 what to do, I only \u0152 even Eichmann in 1961, what he said in \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 in Israel? I followed orders. Well, tell me why did you followed orders? You tell th is to your community, in front of a survivor who is mentally and p hysically able to testify. That is what I am saying them \u0152 should happen to the masses. Not once of all these times I testified did I walk out of the courtrooms with a lighter heart, just satisfied that something was done, because there wasn\u2122t. One damn Nazi in Honolulu called me a liar. He was being tried, he called me a liar. He admitted being on the railroad tracks. He admitted walking and USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 53marching prisoners from and to slave labor. And that\u2122s what I told, he was a killer and he calls me a liar. And what happened to him?

It was the worst piece of junk that was ever produced in ho \u0152 it\u2122s Hollywood, you know, it\u2122s a \u0152 it\u2122s a \u0152 it\u2122s a plastic. But what was good about it? That was \u0152 they had two, two things. One, the worst film. Second, it had the best thing. It got the attention of the pub \u0152 the general public. Well, this is what the general public now wants today. Holocaust is a very fashionable thing, not only because of Spielberg, because of Shoah, and any \u0152 any piece of \u0152 USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 54documentary on Holocaust, true or not tr ue \u0152 I-I shouldn\u2122t say not true, accurate or almost inaccurate, it has some affect on people.

Oh yeah, lot of s \u0152 lot of our population wouldn\u2122t want to hear that. They won\u2122t listen to it. Not because they don\u2122t want to hear, but because they d on\u2122t think it\u2122s \u0152 that should be done. I-In Germany nobody wanted to do it. Listen, his book, hi \u0152 \ufb01Hitler\u2122s Willing Executioners\ufb02 was the biggest seller in Germany. He drew more crowd in Germany when he was lecturing there, and there was boyc otts there. Yet, this is what the people should hear. You know, pretty soon there won\u2122t be any survivors left. We\u2122re getting to be old people. Now, I\u2122m not \u0152 I\u2122m \u0152 I consider myself still one of the younger guys, but at the same time, every day you got less and less \u0152 there\u2122s less and less of us around. A-A-Auschwitz will only be a legend. Now who\u2122s gonna \u0152 other than the Holocaust Museum which I\u2122m doing today, which I did in 1989 for the Holocaust Museum, who is going to be here? Just this . There won\u2122t be a living person to be able to say things like I say, or like other survivors who are capable of talking. So these guys should go out there and do that. And let me tell you, they would have a great audience. Very \u0152 there are so many people that are hungry to know why it happened, because ho \u0152 there are not that many of us that go to schools and colleges and universities. You know, some of us are getting so old that we \u0152 we \u0152 we fantasize. You know, some people fantasize and I get very upset with it, you know. If they don\u2122t USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 55remember what happened to them, th-the-they say something different. And that\u2122s what gets me very upset.

Oh yeah, the people will watch it \u0152 which I\u2122m glad they\u2122re watching, because it [indecipherable] gets the attention. But a Spielberg movie? When I first found out that Steven Spielberg is going to make the Schindler stor \u0152 \ufb01Schindler\u2122s List,\ufb02 at first I was wondering. I says, here is a guy who is going to make a Holocaust movie. He is a man who made \ufb01E.T,\ufb02 what is he going to do with the Holocaust? You know, he\u2122s got Indiana Jones and \ufb01E.T.\ufb02 Well, when the \u0152 \ufb01Schindler\u2122s List\ufb02 came to town, here to Indianapolis, I was invited as a Holocaust survivor to be there for special presentations, and I went. Here comes the elite Jewish community of Indianapolis, some of the elite guys, some of the big givers, what do you call, they come there. Everyone\u2122s got a popcorn in their \u0152 bag in their hand, puts their feet on \u0152 on \u0152 on the other seat and stretch themselves, I hope there\u2122s a \u0152 there is a nice popcorn movie tos \u0152 to watch. So here I am listening, watching, and watching because [indecipherable] what \u0152 what this guy could do, what he did with it. And I walked out of there really almost satisfied that he did a good job. If he\u2122d shown any more atrocities than he show ed in the film, I don\u2122t think people could have sit through it. Some of it was a little schmaltzy. I was a little bit \u0152 you know, I watched it so closely. When Oskar Schindler said at the end, I should have done more, I should have done this, I should have that, I \u0152 I\u2122d \u0152 I didn\u2122t do enough, I should have saved more people, those words, well that was a little schmaltzy to me, you know. Th-That \u0152 USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 57that \u0152 that they could have left out. Yes, Oskar Schindler did help. There\u2122s 5,000 survivors of that group that are alive today because of him. Y ou know, 5,000 members of the families that came la \u0152 after. So that \u0152 that\u2122s \u0152 it was fairly \u0152 done fairly decent. But the other ones, I don\u2122t remember of any other one, other than Sobibor, \ufb01Escape From Sobibor,\ufb02 I\u2122m sorry, that was done because they found people that survived Sobibor and these were the people that helped, same as Oskar Schindler got the \u0152 got the book from a \u0152 from a \u0152 from the luggage store in \u0152 in L.A. and here\u2122s these guys from th \u0152 Long Island, New York who were Sobibor survivors, they helped with the movie. Well, that was almost \u0152 pretty accurate. But other than that, there is nothing. Absolutely nothing. Kirk Douglas was in the movie one time, and I \u0152 I tell you something, I \u0152 I was going to go over there and kick the hell out of him for that movie. But if \u0152 but you di \u0152 what it is, the American public. They eat it up. They listen to it, they want to know.

However, all Germans my age and older, and some even younger were responsible for the atrocities that happened to us, th at \u0152 that was done to us. Even if they themselves did \u0152 were not involved in throwing us into the ovens, but they were part of the process, part of the organization, part of the hate, part of the people that killed us. However you, as USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 72a young German, I can\u2122t hold yo u responsible for the atroc ity that happened to us \u0152 done to us by a \u0152 by your grandparents. But when you go back home, ask your parents, if they were old enough, or your grandparents, what did they do from 1933 to 1945? What did they do to stop the atrocities? What did they do to stop Kristallnacht? What did they do to stop deportation? What did th ey do to stop taking away Jewish shops and Jewish businesses? What did they do to bu rn Jewish temples? This is what you got to ask their parents, your parents and grandparents. But as far as hating you, I don\u2122t even hate your parents, let alone you."

I probably would have been same as the rest of them, because it was inbred in them.

And I probably would have been one of them. I grew up in it. You know, I referee soccer in Indianapolis in the state of Indiana. There\u2122s a German man named Hans Gut, came to this country in the 50\u2122s with his USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 73father.

Not too many did it, cause if there were so many Righteous Gentiles, why else \u0152 if there were so many, why so many of us died, why so many was killed. Let me tell you my own personal experiment \u0152 experience with what you just asked me. First part of 1942, I was in a slave labor camp in Slovakia called Nov\u00e1ky. There was a good friend of mine whose name was Josef Knap(ph), Kanap(ph) in Slovak, Knap (ph). Josef Knap(ph) had a Christian girlfriend, name was Terri(ph) \u0152 Therese \u0152 ter \u0152 terra \u0152 terries \u0152 Th-Therese. Him and I escaped together from Nov\u00e1ky. He knew his way pretty well, he was a bout a year and a half older than me. We get to our hometown, Topol\u2122 any , his \u0152 her father had a small farm on the outskirts of our city and we two boys, esca pees, going the back doors, back ways so we will get picked up by this \u0152 by the gendarmes, by the police of our town. Came to USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 75this house hoping that I would be able to hi de there too. Well, the father of the girl, father of Therese, the father said, I\u2122m taking Josef in my house and hide him, but I\u2122m not taking a chance with two Jews in my house. And here I am, stuck out on the outskirt of our town, got picked up by polic e as I was walking back to town, beat the hell out of me, send me back to Nov\u00e1ky. In 1946 I went back to Slovakia wi \u0152 through the army because I went to get my papers and those two are still married, of course, they had a child. And she cried. She apologized to me that her father wouldn\u2122t take me. Her father died since, but he wouldn\u2122t take me. So \u0152 but as fate would have it, I survived, she says, so at least I came to see them. Josef Knap (ph) died, let\u2122s see, 1990 I was in Israel and there was a Czechoslovakian gathering of Holocaust survivors, and there was another Jew \u0152 Jewish person ther e who travels from \u0152 to my hometown and he told me that he died a few months ago. So the Righteous Gentiles really weren\u2122t that many. As far as the guy said he woul dn\u2122t do it, I believe it, because most people didn\u2122t want to do it. My father had enough Christian friends and people that he dealt with, people that he sold horses and cattle to, that somebody could have saved us. Nobody was willing."

I\u2122 ll tell you another story. In 1961 we lived in Cleveland, Ohio . I was working for a company called Shoppers Fair. I was straightening out a couple of shelves in the store with my sleeves \u0152 short sleeve shirt on. A guy walks in, he says, you got number. I know man got number. Talks with an accent. I said oh yeah, you do? Okay. I bring him here. Next day he drags in a gu \u0152 brings in a guy, we were together in Auschwitz. This guy\u2122s name was Mutti(ph) Klein(ph). He worked with my father with the horses at Auschwitz. We became f \u0152 of course, close friends until we moved to Cleveland, he \u0152 they \u0152 a-and \u0152 USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 81and he eva \u0152 a-a-after awhile he got a heart attack. Then he retired in Florida . In 1990 we went to Israel ag-again for the gathering, and he didn't make it because he was ill. And there I met some people that know him also because they came the same time as we did to Auschwitz. We got home to Indianapolis, we found out a few months later he died. So that was also through his number because the guy seen me at work, stocking shelves at Shoppers Fair. So the number is always there and always comes up in the conversation wherever I go. And when I went to Germany to test \u0152 testify, I made it a point when we were free from court, and we went for train rides and went \u0152 anywhere we went, I would always [indecipherable] summertime, of course we were there summertime, I would sit there \u0152 and always would like to sit close to an older German, just to let him see the number. And they would look at you, then they put the head down and never look at you again. Probably couldn't get a \u0152 couldn\u2122t \u0152 couldn\u2122t wait to get off the next stop.

But the \u212281 in Israel, that is where I met Kulka and met some other people, a couple guys from France who worked with me in the Kanada commando. And then \u0152 that was the hard est part. That was the \u0152 that was the hardest part for me. When at Yad Vashem we heard a first speech by a \u0152 the le \u0152 one of the leaders of the group, and man there wasn \u2122t a dry eye in the place. This is when I really cried, when they start talking, my number is such and such. And then you walked through the Yad Vashem Museum where all the photographs of \u0152 original photographs of Nazis that t \u0152 took \u0152 the do cumentation, Nazi documentation took. As I walked through, I\u2122ve seen the railroad tracks where I worked. And I\u2122ve seen the prisoners whom I knew and I point \u0152 could point out who they were. And that broke me down. And NPR was there, she interviewed me, a lady interviewed me, I couldn\u2122t finish the interview, that\u2122s how bad I was. That was very, very emotional. And we went \u0152 since then, of course, we went to a few more gathering \u0152 Holocaust gathering. I had the great honor, because of the Holocaust Museum and the Holocaust organization, May eighth, this pa st May eighth, be invited to Washington, D.C. at the capital rotunda to do the Holocaust Memorial Kaddish. So I did May eighth in Washington, which was also very beautiful."
