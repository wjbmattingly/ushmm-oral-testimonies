            "answer": "Well, the synagogue played an important part. Every Friday night the men would go to synagogue. I think my mother was home on Friday night, and then there was the usual Shabbas 3 dinner. And I do have a picture of the dining room table on a regular Shabbat evening, with the candles, and the challah, the kiddish cup, and my grandfather, w ho lived upstairs, would always be at our house every Friday evening. This would be routine, and then on a Shabbat morning, we always went to synagogue. The synagogue played a big role in my childhood. The men and women were seated separately. The men were dow nstairs and the women were upstairs like in a gallery. The children were with the women and we would look through this little fence-type thing and go downs -- look downstairs at the men. And I would look forward to the one particular time that the children were allowed downstairs in the main synagogue, and that was Simchas Torah, when they had s-sweets and ca ndies for the children. And I even remember playing a prank here or there in the synagogue by putting some bread -- breadcrumbs or cookies into some men\u2122s jackets. My fr iend Ruth Oppenheimer, her name then was Ruth Lindheimer, but she also lives in New York, and we are still very, very good friends, I talk to her daily, well she and I played this prank and we put these cookies, or crumbs in to men\u2122s suits and pockets. And eventually we had to go and own up to it and apologize. We did."

There was one -- this was the main synagogue, and then there was another little synagog ue called Klaus, and that was for those who were super, super Orthodox. And there were quite a few Jewish family who were very, very Orthodox. And in the building which used to be the Klaus synagogue is where they are now having the new little museum to commemorate and try to show what Jewish life was like before Hitler."

But by the standards of Halberstadt, it was not considered to be so, because people were either extremely Orthodox -- and I remember my mother saying [indecipherable] kosher, which means we are new kosher, and that meant we\u2122re not so terribly strict."

            "answer": "It was a very charming town of mostly half -timbered houses. Half-timbered means it\u2122s sort of cement and wood together, with a great deal of de tail of wood. And I remember some of the old buildings, one having a statue on the outside, and that is the town hall. This statue was called Bucco, and we learned a little poem as childr en, which says Bucco von Halberstadt [speaks German here]. And it means, Bucco from Halber stadt, what will you give our children? Will you give them a new pair of shoes? Yes, that\u2122s what your children should have. And I remember some of these children\u2122s songs and some of thes e children\u2122s poems, because I was 10 and a half years old when I left Halberstadt."

            "answer": "Yes, I believe it was. As a matter of fact, Halberstadt was well renowned in the Jewish circles, because of having a large community and a ve ry active synagogue, and a very active Jewish community life. I have noticed that in some of thos e old papers that I have, and the ones that date 5 back about 300 years, they were written in Hebrew, so we had some of those translated. And they -- it said for instance, that many businesse s were conducted while in s -- during or after synagogue when people -- it was a meeting place, so it was a very active Jewish community."

            "answer": "I do think that my -- the majority of my pare nt\u2122s friends were Jewish. Also, the children I went to school with, since I was at the Jewish school, they we re all Jewish, and the parents would be fren -- friendly for many, many years."

            "answer": "Our home was a rather elegant home. It was s ituated right above these stores, which were at ground level. My grandfather owned the property, and there were at least three to four bedrooms, a large living room, then there was -- the livi ng was qua -- w-was -- the efs -- there was [speaks German], which is a smoking room. So it\u2122s a dining room, living room, smoking room. My parent\u2122s bedroom, my brother\u2122s bedroom, a nd mine, and there was a guest bedroom. And everything was rather elegantly furnished. We had a maid who took care of my brother and myself. Her name was Alvina, and she was with us for many, many years. I have a picture even now of Alvina and my brother and I being at the wedding and I was the flower girl, age about four or five years old, with little flowers in th e hair. But I do have the picture of Alvina. She married a man who was a carpenter, and my parent s asked this ge -- this gentleman to make a copy of our kitchen, so I had a small kitchen, a re plica of my parent\u2122s ki tchen, and as a child I played with that a great deal. A nd when I went to England my par -- parents actually sent that children\u2122s furniture to England. What happened to it, I don\u2122t know."

And children at school get like a big bag, like a huge cone out of cardboard, and that is filled with candy and toys and pencils. So that was a very happy kind of memory. That was appr oximately 1935, and I was at the Jewish school until the school was closed, and that was after Kristallnacht - Crystal Night."

            "answer": "I guess things were still quite normal in the early days. For instance, Hebrew was taught from the beginning on, like a foreign language. Later on I would learn a foreign language by translation. And so we translated prayers, and not only learned to translate word for word, but also how to make little sentences, so that we had a fairly good knowledge of Hebrew. I can still read Hebrew, although I must say that when I left Germany, I had little contact later on with Jewish people."

That family had five children in various ages from -- some -- the older one was called yo -- Jota, and she came with me to the train station on the day I left Germany. But school was a happy time, and it seemed perfectly normal, we did the usual things, like gymnastics. I would walk to school, it was not very far, probably a 10 minute walk. And having been back in Germany a couple of years ago, I saw the building again."

How many chil -- students were there, I don\u2122t kno w, but I do have a picture of all the students 7 together, taken in Halberstadt at a time when my brot her and I were at school together, and my friend Ruth, and her present husband Henry are also on that picture.

            "answer": "Well, my brother was, as I said, five years ol der than I, and he seemed to be very proud of having a little sister. He often told me later on as we were growing up that he said [speaks German here]. In other words that means I or -- put in an order for you. So he was very proud of having a little sister. Although, as I grew up, I think I was sometimes a bit of a burden when my parents said they had to take me along, and I would drag behind all these boys, who were teenagers by then, and they had to take along the younger sister. So it wasn\u2122t always great fun for him, but perfectly normal. However, my brothe r took great responsibility for me. Obviously, my parents must have said that he should keep an eye on me always , and he always did because the two of us were in England, even though we were not together."

            "answer": "I can\u2122t remember any discrimination, but I ac tually don\u2122t think that among my circle of friends that there were non-Jewish friends, because they were probably children I went to school with, and children whose parents my parents knew. So I don\u2122t have any real collection -- recollection of anyone non-Jewish."

And I think my parents shielded us from any extra worries, or extra concerns. Howe ver, I do remember seeing signs in the windows that said, Juden [indecipherable]. That means, Jews are not welcome here. And I would question that sort of thing by -- because I could r ead by then. In 1933, Hitle r came to power on my birthday, January 30th. Other schools had a holiday because Hitler was in power, it was a day off from school. Not in the Jewish school, we went to school. And then one day, coming from school -- and this would be closer to like 1938, other kids would call across the street, look at those Jews, look at those Jewish children, and the kids would throw stones at us. And I said -- I could not understand, why would they be throwing stones at us, we weren\u2122t doing anything. And you\u2122d run home as quick as possible.

            "answer": "I was aware that there was a Nazi party, be cause the other children, who were not Jewish, belonged to an organization called the Hitlerjugend. The Hitler yout h. And of course, my brother did not belong to the Hitler youth, who would have been maybe 14 or 15 at that time. But the Jewish youngsters had their own organization, the Maccabee or some other clubs that they would have. But the Hitler youth were very visible in Ge rmany, and of course I was aware of that. But it was not a major discussion in my parent\u2122s hom e until the night of Kristallnacht, when the Nazis came to our home in the middle of the ni ght, and they knocked at the door, and if -- everybody was sleeping, it was an ordinary night, no one expected anything unusual. And there were two men at the door, and they said, we are here to get mis -- Mr. Cohn, Ernst Cohn, my 9 father. And he had to get dressed very quickly, and the two men marched downstr -- the street. Our home is diagonally across from the main post office. The main post office is still there, our home is not. And as we looked out, we could see other Jewish men, each one with two SS men, they\u2122re -- the Nazis. And they walked them off, we did not know where they were going. They took them and put them into a prison in Halber stadt. And a couple of hours later they knocked at our door again, and they said, we came to ge t the other Mr. Cohn. And my mother said, you already took him, he\u2122s gone, he -- he left. And they said, there\u2122s another one. Well, my brother was hiding in a closet or somewhere that same night. And she said, the only other Herr Cohn is upstairs, but you would have to carry him because he is an invalid and he is very old. They said no, that\u2122s not the one, and they left. That way my brother was not taken. My father was then taken to Buchenwald, a concentration camp."

            "answer": "Well, I realized that things were terribly, te rribly wrong, and it\u2122s a -- an extraordinarily scary event for any child. I did not know the multitude of significance of what was happening on a worldwide basis at the time. My father was in Bu chenwald for a little over five weeks. We did find out where he was. I don\u2122t know whether it was Red Cross letters, or -- by some way, my mother knew where my father was. And he cam e home after five weeks, a good five weeks in Buchenwald, and his hair was shaven from his head completely, he had lost a lot of weight. And my father, having been on the road as a salesman for many years, said, I always brought you something home, well I brought you something. And he had dry bread in his pockets that was very, very hard, but he said, I brought this for you. It was then, when my father came home, that my parents decided they must do something to re scue the lives of their children, for my brother 10 and I. And they then registered me for the -- or both of us for the kindertransport. My brother, however, was 15 at the time, and I was 10, a nd at 15 they no longer took children on the kindertransport. They took them from four to 14, and he was a little too old, so he was not able to have guardians in England like I did."

Did you ask any -- you know, additional questions of your parents? Do you remember anyt hing else going on even before all of this happened at Kristallnacht?",
            "answer": "Well, they came to every Jewish home and collect -- demanded all silver and gold. So my parents had to give up the jewelry, and I believe they must have hidden certain things, they did not give up everything. But they hi -- picked up sil -- silverware. You were allowed to keep two sets of silver per person. So I don\u2122t know just how many things my parents were able to save legitimately, but I remember them coming to ev ery Jewish home and collecting these items. And of course my father\u2122s store was closed. You were no longer allowed to have a store, to run a business, which my -- was in my f -- grandfathe r\u2122s hands, and then my father\u2122s hands for many, many years. There was this line and fabrique Ha lberstadt.

But at -- the building always belonged to my grandfather, and bef -- tween the main building, there was a 11 yard in the back of the main building, and then another house, called Hinterhouse, like the second row of houses, and that had tenants in it. So there were a lot of people living in that small area. Unfortunately, just towards the end of World War , the whole property was bombed, and there\u2122s none of that left, and when I went over there for the first time, I thought I would feel terrible about seeing my parent\u2122s home, but it\u2122s no longer there. So I did not have to feel terrible about a building I had never seen before, built by the Russians."

            "answer": "Yes, I do remember the diary. For my 10 th birthday I got a diary from my mother, and on the front page it says tagabu, which is diary, given to me by mutti, by my mother, for my birthday. And I wrote about every day life in Halberstadt, and the little pra nks we played as children, and the normal life, really, because I was a pretty happy-go-lucky child, and did not have all the burdens of the world on my shoulder. So I kept this diary, and the first part of it is all written in German, however when I left Germany to go to England, being on the train and feeling very much alone and knowing no one, I wrote into the diary, and I even wrote into the diary in Holland, which is the route we took from Holla nd to -- from Hook van Holland to England. And since there was nobody for me to communicate wit h, and I didn't realize that suddenly I was really alone and on my way some where, not knowing where I was going, I guess it became a bit scary, and so I wrote into the diary."

            "answer": "Since that was my parent\u2122s wish, to have us in a safe place, my parents were actually very clever, because when I think about how my pa rents handled discussing this with me, I only realize how very wise they were. For instance, both my parents said, look how lucky you are. You will be learning another language, you will be seeing new people. And they just made me feel like I was very special and ve ry fortunate, so I believed that and -- and left quite happily, not realizing then that I would never see my parents again. And of course, I must add that we were all in hopes that we would be reunited in the United States. If that quota number had come through and had not been a war declared, eventually my parents would have gone to America, 14 and we would have joined them. And that was the fact with many of the other children who came to England like I did. I was not one of the fortunate ones."

            "answer": "Those are all very unhappy memo ries. I know that many Jewish families, whoever were there, it was the women, came to my parent\u2122s home, wh ich was always a very gracious, open house, very ha-happy place for people to congregate. So people came there just to be together. And I know that eventually they all had to give up their apartments and homes and I heard that many families moved in with my parents, and that was after I had left. But my memories of the time when my father was in concentration camp, it wa s a terrible time and great insecurity. We did not know if my father would come home, if he would survive. We we re already aware that terrible things were happening to Jews everywhere. So these were unhappy memories, and my parent\u2122s effort was to save the life\u2122s of their children."

I believe my father would have had the opportunity to go to Cuba, but he did not want to go alone, he would not have left my mother. So unless they could have gone togeth er, my father did not want to go alone. I was told that, and I think that happened after I was already in England. Now, I only know that the family I mentioned before from the headmaster, those children, there were five children, would have had an opportunity to go to England on the kindertransport, but Herr Luntner said, either we all go, or none of us go. And that\u2122s the choice that people had. So that on the monument which is 15 today in Halberstadt at the place where all the Je wish people had to assemble to be deported, all the Jewish people, and on the men -- monument are the names of the people who were deported, and it has the father and mother of the Luntners and all five children.

In Germany she was a very wealthy woman, married to a banker in Frankfurt, Ulya Spear. Now she became a cham bermaid in England, in Manchester. So my parents wrote to Tante Lucy and said Lillyshin is going to England next week, this is the address of the family, Mr. and Mrs. Allen, and the address in Rochdale, Lancashire. My aunt immediately contacted the Allens, and visited the A llens, and they were very gracious to her. So we had a little knowledge about the family I w ould be going to. My aunt then wrote to my parents and said that I would be very lucky to be with such a wonderful family and that they are very, very anxious to have me come.

It was about the size of a -- the height of a dining room tabl e, it was a good size little unit of a dishwashing sink and a little table and chairs. And my friend Ruth had the same thing made. So they sent that and a very large steamer trunk. And in that steamer trunk was, at the very bottom, an Oriental rug, a runner, and a lot of linens. And of course I couldn\u2122t understand why I should have all these linens, but they\u2122re beautiful works of art, all handmade, and of course that was my father\u2122s business. And I have always kept these linens and I\u2122m using the pillowcases to this day. They are just very, very beautiful, and they wash beautifully, and it\u2122s a constant reminder of my childhood. There was also an accordion when these things arrived. At customs they s -- thought that the accordion was sent as a valuable item that one could sell as an investment, so they said, can I play it? So I said sure. So I remember ri ght there in the customs, where someone from the Allen\u2122s family took me, and I took the accordion a nd played quite well.

And little did I understand what my mother was talking about.

She also explained menstruation, not to be scared if that should happen. And of course at the age of 10 it\u2122s very early to be speaking about these things, especially since I wasn\u2122t asking these questions, but my mother probably antici pated that there may not be anyone there who would explain these things. And it wasn\u2122t until much later that I really understood what that was all about. But my recollections in getting ready we re all positive, because I was told how lucky I am and you see this [indecipherable] Ruth I was ta lk about, she doesn\u2122t have guardians -- she did eventually, and she also came to England. But at the time, each child who was lucky enough to go was considered very, very fortunate, becau se -- and by that time everyone was trying frantically to get out, just to be secure and to save lives."

And they were always good humored and good-natured. In none of the letters did it ever say, your room is empty and we miss you. It was always, look how lucky you are. And in my first letter to my parents, I wrote that ma -- the guardians wanted me to call them Pop and Ma, a nd I didn\u2122t want to do that. But my father wrote back -- no, it was my mother who wrote, you s ee how lucky you are, you already have two sets of parents and I had to wait until I was married to have a second se t of parents. So you\u2122re very fortunate. Go to them and give them a hug and tell them you love them, and always be gracious and be grateful.

And in Hanover my parents were no longer allowe d to go onto the train station, to the track to say goodbye. They kept parents away at that time. That\u2122s why I think the picture of my parents and I at the train is a rather rare picture, and it is used a great deal for teaching purposes in American schools and schools in Germany. So that pa rticular picture was taken in Halberstadt at the train station, but not in Hanover. There was one other boy who went with me on the 20 kindertransport, his name was David Winter.

I guess I looked out of the window and at that point there was no one there, and I -- it was the first time I realized that I\u2122m really alone, and where am I off to? However, the kindertransport was well organized. It was a locked train, Nazis came in, they would ask questions. Do you have rings, do you have a diamond, do you have a watch? They would ask all kinds of questions, but for security reasons I think everyone was very careful with their children. Parents would not put their children at risk, so -- but they would be walking around, and finally we came to Holland, and suddenly the older children were very jubilant and so happy. They said that we have left Germany. This is the -- th is is an upsetting time , having left Germany. However, people got onto the train once we got to Holland, and they brought cocoa and cookies and apples, and the older children, who were more aware of what was going on, were very jubilant and they sang Hebrew songs, the sort of songs they would sing at a club or at a party. And it was only then that I realized that we are really out of Germany. From Holland we got onto a ship, which took us across the English channel. And we were as signed certain berths. My berth was the upper berth. And I had never slept in a bed that was made with sheets and blankets, because in my parent\u2122s home we had a feat her bed. Was like a huge pillow, and you got under 21 the -- under the feather bed. Well, I didn\u2122t know what to do with this. I slept on top of the bed, I did not know that you had to get in between. And I thought it was a rather strange way of living, but -- so I did all the things that were expected and re quired, and by morning we arrived in England. I believe it was Harrage. And we were all herded off the ship, and were taken to a huge, huge hall, with lots of benches. And we all had a tag around our neck with a number, like a cardboard tag with a ribbon. And you -- each per -- kid had a different number, and then you waited until somebody called your number. I guess they did it in English and German at the time, just the numbers. And when my number came up, th is -- to me she seemed like an elderly lady, she was probably in her 40\u2122s, and that was Nellie, Nellie Mills, the private secretary of Mr. Allen. He sent his private secretary to pick me up. And Nellie Mills was always very, very kind to me and very good-hearted. I had great respect for her."

So the first thing she do -- did, was to take me to the bathroom, and eventu ally we ended on another train which took us to Manchester, took us north, and from Manchester we went by car to Rochdale. And Rochdale is where my guardians lived. So Ne llie was the one who took me to my guardians. And was a very, very lovely house, and Mr. and Mrs. Allen were very anxious to have a little girl there. It was only later on that I found out their reason why they wanted to have a child in their home. It was a very gracious, beautiful home. They had seve ral cars, a Rolls Royce, and a Lady Austin, a private chauffeur, and Mr. Allen owned a bus company. In America we would call such a company like Greyhound. It was privately owned, calle d Yelloway. So he was the owner of this 22 particular bus company that rode buses from Manchester to London, or Ma nchester to Liverpool, long distance bus lines. They were quite wealthy people. And the Allens have a son called Hubert. Hubert was already grown and he was in his 20\u2122s. So he was about 25 years old when I came to them. So, you know, he couldn\u2122t really be bothered with a youngster too much, but he was always very kind to me. We had a very nice relationship. They told me that\u2122s my big brother."

But they were not pe ople who would to go a church, and I never went to another synagogue. I don\u2122t think there was one in Rochdale. But the nuns were very kind to me in many ways. For instance, when Mrs. Alle n was -- Mrs. Allen was rather sickly. She had mental problems of depression, and sh -- at tim es she could not put up with a child around. I 25 might be doing something perfectly normal, what I would consider normal, playing with a ball or something, and that could upset her terribly, wh ich I couldn't understand until many years later, when they explained to me that she was havi ng mental problems. And that was one of the reasons why they thought that having a child in their home would be good th erapy for her. But it isn\u2122t such good therapy for a child, because I coul dn\u2122t understand these things. So I would either live with Nellie for awhile, or I would live with the nuns. And with the nuns I would frequently have religious debates at a very young age, becau se I knew a lot from Halberstadt, being that it was a rather religious community, I was pretty we ll versed in the Bible, and the -- what I have learned from home.

I was pretty strong about the things that I had learned. And I never did have to participate in the New Testament, only in the prayers that they had every morning. And as far as the English language is concerned, I learned English very quickly. I would think that within four weeks, I was able to understand the Allens, although I thought they spoke too quickly. But within two months I was able to do all the schoolwork, like all the ot hers, and I was on an even level as far as math and other subjects were concerned. I had no difficulty in catching up with the English children. I wore the uniform of the convent, a navy blue uniform with a wh ite collar, and a blue and red hat, and blue and red scarf, and I was dressed like all the other children in the convent and made friends there, and that seemed to be a normal life, which I became accustomed to quite quickly."

He kne w some English and was able to get around, and my aunt was in Manchester, but he had a difficult time to just survive. But he got a job, and then another job, and he did very well."

And of course they w ould write, why haven\u2122t you written, and can you send us a picture? And this is, you know, several years like that. Eventually there were Red Cross letters. A Red Cross letter was 25 words. 25 words from my parents, and they came like a telegram, and you were allowed to write back 25 words, and it goes back to the sender. So that was the only communication during the war that was official communication."

            "question": "Tell me more about them.",
            "answer": "Okay. Well, when I first ca-came to the Allen\u2122 s house, Mr. Allen was sick at the time, so he was bedridden with something, no-not on a perman ent basis. But he was a very patient and kind man, so I spent a lot of time at his bedside, a nd he would teach me English. He would point to the ceiling and say ceiling, I would say ceiling. He would pa -- point to the floor and say floor, I\u2122d say floor. And I repeated everything that he said and then he would point again and see if I would remember it. And I did fairly well. Then he went t -- he asked me to bring his wallet, I brought his wallet. And he took out all kinds of change. And he said, this is a penny, that\u2122s a threepenny bit, that\u2122s a sixpence, that\u2122s a shilling. And so I said, a penny, a threepence -- I couldn\u2122t say threepence, that was very hard, because to put your tongue between your teeth to do a t-h, doesn\u2122t exist in German. So I probably said tripence, but it\u2122s threepence, three pennies. And sixpence, a shilling and I think that\u2122s as high as it went. When I had it all correct, he said I 28 could keep it, it\u2122s mine. That I understood. So I thought I was very rich, I now had all this change, which of course I wrote to my parents. I wrote, I have a penny, a threepence, sixpence, and a shilling. And my father, which I have in the first letter said, now that you are so rich, shall I send you the safe which we used to have? Y ou see, we no longer had the store. He said, because you need to put all that money in a safe place. So my father\u2122s good humor always came through. But Mr. Allen was very, very kind and very patient, but he was a true businessman, very, very successful. Hubert, the son, who was in his early 20\u2122s, was one who played cricket. He had this cricket outfit, and at Christmastime would sing in the Christmas carols, there were all these young men, they were there. They were all a lot older than I was. But he was very, very nice and very kind to me. He was already active in the business at Yelloway. And Mrs. Allen was the typical English housewife. When I look back on the times with Mrs. Allen, she was very spoiled, because she had everything done for her. She had maid service all the time, she had a chauffeur just to take her around. And she lived -- could live very graciously, but she had phobias. She thought people were laughing at her. I could not understand these things, because a youngster does not understand that. But she was a very kind person, and as I said, they told me to call them Pop and Ma, which I did. And Hubert, who was the big brother. And I was very happy. It became a new home for me. By now the war was on one year, two years, and a ve -- at one time, after Mrs. Allen had been sick again a nd hospitalized, she got a shock me -- treatments, several times while I was there. So they told me that they would send me away. And I couldn\u2122t understand that. They said, well we did not know that the war would go on so long, and we will always take care of you, and they gave me all th ese stories. But I was extremely upset. I think it was much more upset -- maybe more upsetting fo r me to leave the Allens, because it was a second, complete upheaval. The first one I was well prepared for. The -- leaving the Allens I was 29 not prepared for, and I didn\u2122t have that security behind me as ha ving parents, real parents. So they sent me to Tunbridge Wells, which is in th e south of England. Tunbridge Wells in the state of Kent. And that was a -- don\u2122t remember the exact year, but probably 1942. There was still a letter from my parents saying th at I should not leave the Allens, please stay with the Allens, but this was beyond my control."

Cause every child who was at The Beacon had a guardian somewhere. A nd suddenly here we were, we found ourselves all together. There must have been maybe 50 ch ildren or more, of different ages, who had all come to England on the kindertransport. But now the war was in progress for a couple of years, and the guardians did not realize that they would have these children for so long, and sent them to this particular school, called The Beacon. They -- the children there were in age from approximately six to 16. When I first got there I was a junior. Later on we -- we became middles and then we became seniors, depending upon your age group. And we shared one large dormitory room together for at least 12 or more girls in one room. And we got to know each other very, very well. The same girls who were at The Beacon then are still my closest friends today. Some of the girls stayed in England when the war was over, and others went to different parts of the world. A few were fortunate enough to be reunited with their parents. Some knew that their parents were alive. I was among those who were hoping that the parents were alive. But, to no avail."

            "question": "So tell me about the physical surroundings. What -- what was the -- set the scene a little bit at The Beacon.",
            "answer": "Well, The Beacon was an old mansion many, ma ny years ago, and when I think about it from America, I think of it as a huge, huge building. When I went back there for a reunion after 50 years, it\u2122s not as big as I thought it was, it\u2122s just an average big house. But it was a gracious building, and there was lots of laughter and lots of -- of good fun among the girls, although we lived under pretty meager conditions. This was, after all, wartime. Food was rationed, and we had a cook at The Beacon, her name was Mrs. Ha yward. That name Hayward was important in my life. Mrs. Hayward was the cook, and we had certain assignments to help. To either peel potatoes or help with the dishwashing. After all, there were ma ny, many children there. The food was mainly boiled fish, boiled cabbage and boi led potatoes. So you weren't really hungry, because you could eat more potatoes, and you could eat more potatoes, but it was pretty awful. I mean, it was very healthy food because everythi ng was boiled. They did not have fats. You did not have oil, you didn\u2122t have butter. These things were highly rationed during the war. And we did not see fruit, but vegetables were growing in the area, and there we re beautiful, beautiful grounds attached to The Beacon, with three what we called lakes, but they were really puddles. What we thought was a lake, we took an old bedstead and thought that was a boat. We paddled around in that. We improvised with everything. O ccasionally clothes came from America. There would be a bunch of shoes, and you could try them on, and if a pair fitted you, they were yours. So we had a lot of clothes like that. Schooling was at The Beacon, it was not too great. Later on they sent us to a school in the town and it was called Holy Trinity. It was worse. It was really not 32 a good school at all. I was able to take an exam for a special high school. Like in New York we have Stuyvesant High School, Bronx Science, a special school. The school would have been in Tunbridge, we were in Tunbridge Wells. Tunbridge was maybe 10 miles away. I passed the test, but then they -- the government said I was not a Br itish subject is what they called it, so I was not able to go to the school, but continued at Holy Trinity, which was not much of a school. But I read a lot and eventually, at the age of 16, I was still there, we all had to choose a career of some sort. Most of the girls went in for nursing. And I said no, I didn\u2122t want to be a nurse. And how about a secretarial school? I said no, I didn\u2122t think I would like that. They said, well what would I like to study? So I said art. So I di -- t ook some kind of art exam, probably drawing something very basic, and I was able to go to the art school. So I went to the school of arts and crafts in Tunbridge Wells, and loved it. We drew from th e skeleton, and Michelangelo, and nude figures. And I think I did quite well, bu t one of the ladies from the committee who took care of The Beacon girls said, you have to learn a profession where you can earn money. I hadn\u2122t really considered that, seriously. So they told me that I should concentrate on dress design and dressmaking, and they did teach that at the school , at the art school. So I learned how to draw dresses and how to make patterns, very basic patt erns. And I took an exam while at the school of arts and crafts for the [indeciphe rable] of London, and I got a degree in fashion at the time. I was still very young, and enjoyed doing that. However, after about two years at the school, they said you now have to take a job and earn money. And that\u2122s rather difficult in the fashion field, especially when you have no background. So one of the ladies from the committee of The Beacon in Tunbridge Wells had dresses made at a very fancy couturier shop in London called Jaquemar. So I had -- they told me I would ha ve a -- get a job at Jaquemar in London. And my 33 brother lived in London by that time, so that was a very good thing for both of us, because that -- from that time on, my brother and I were alwa ys in touch, I think we saw each other daily."

Half of them now live in England, and ha -- maybe half in America, and a few are in different parts of the world. But th -- all the children had a similar background. Now, the interesting part is that I had a friend in New York, her name at The Beac on was Sylvia Balbera. Her married name was Schneider, Sylvia Schneider. And she lived in Ne w York until last year, she passed away. If you asked Sylvia about the years at The Beacon, sh e would give you a completely different story about how dreadful it was, not only the food, but the way we were dressed, and that nobody loved us, and nobody cared. And yet, I look at the same years as saying they were productive. They made us realize what is im portant in life and what is not so important in life. Cause we had next to nothing, and yet we had each other. I thin k it taught us a great deal about the values of what is important and what isn\u2122t important."

Were the Allens sending you money, and -- and what did you need in those days in terms of money?",
            "answer": "I don\u2122t remember receiving money from the Allens, although I visited them, I would say, about twice a year. I would go to get to London -- you had to get pol -- permission from the police department that you were leaving your re sidence, since we were known as enemy aliens all during the war. All the children were enemy aliens, cause we were not British subjects. But that was not difficult, to get the permit to go. So I would go to London and from London I would get on one of their buses, to go to Rochdale, to go to Manchester, and from Manchester to Rochdale. And most of the drivers knew me from the time I was a little girl. So I did visit the Allens on a somewhat regular basis, and they always wrote to me. But now The Beacon really was our home. The one thing I need to mention is th at when I was told that I need to have a job in London, Mrs. Hayward, who was the cook, had her son and daughter-in-law as visitors most weekends. And they came there by bicycle from London with a young couple, to stay with her because there was a lot of bombing going on. This was the height of the war, and the doodlebugs, which are one kind of bomb, would come over the area of Tunbridge Wells, and they had balloon barrages up to prevent the planes from reaching London. However, this couple, Hayward, Alec Hayward -- Alec Hayward, right, and Agnes, would come to Tunbridge Wells most weekends. And Alec was an artist. So he and I would do some sketching together. We would draw The Beacon, or we would draw a tree, or whatever, and I got to know this couple 35 quite well. So Mr. Hayward, this is the young Mr . Hayward, said to me, where are you going to live when you go to London? And I said I don\u2122t know yet. I did not know. So he said, well if you would like, you can live with us because we have a small house in West Wickham, which is just outside of London, and we have an extra bedroom, and if you like you can stay with us. And that is what I did, I then lived with the Haywards in London. I did not make enough money to pay for the train fare, and I paid a little bit to the Haywards for room a nd board, it wasn\u2122t very much. But the Bloomsbury House helped out at that point. So Blooms bury House paid the ou -- the Haywards something towards my keep. And I earn ed 35 shillings at Jaquemar, and I learned the dress trade from the bottom up. I started by picking up the pins off the floor with a magnet, and then they let me put in some ba sting threads, and take out basting threads. I was allowed to do little things, but gradually I learned more and more. And in England one learned a profession by being an apprentice. It\u2122s not necessarily a school .

Of course, when I started going to the convent high school, was the name of the convent I went to where my guardians sent me, they of course realized that the Mogen Dovid was not appropriate to go to a Catholic school. So I was told then that I could not wear it at all, and I never did, but I always kept the Mogen Dovid. So I had it for years and years. Whenever I would look at it, it brought back me mories, of course. Many years later, it would now be 19 years ago, our son Steven got marri ed to Susan, Susan Soto. Susan was not born Jewish, but she became Jewish before Miranda th eir daughter was born. So when j -- when Susan converted to Judaism, and that is in Florida, I don\u2122t know the exact year, but it is 19 years ago, Susan went into the ocean with her husband, our son Steven, because there was no mikvah in Palm Beach, so the rabbi was there at the o cean with Susan, who was pregnant with their daughter Miranda, and Steven said, you know, my wife is pregnant, I can\u2122t put her in any further. And the rabbi said further, she has to go down more. She had just had her hair done for the wedding. Said further, she has to go down further. And Susan went to the so-called mikvah in the ocean, she was converted to Judaism, and Susan received the Mogen Dovid, which I was not allowed to wear as a child. And Susan has the Mogen Dovid very proudly, and will pass it on to Miranda one day. 38"

            "answer": "The war was a very difficult time for everyone in England. In London they had the major air raids, where huge areas were bombed. But Tunbridge Wells was in direct line from Germany via Tunbridge Wells, to London. So the bombs and th e planes, which were called doodlebugs -- they didn\u2122t have pilots, it was just a plane with a bomb that would come over. In the area of Tunbridge Wells and surrounding farm country, they put up these huge lines on different levels, and balloons, this cal -- they were called balloon barrage, hoping that they would entangle the flight of any one of these planes so that they would not reach London. And indeed, quite a few f -- fl -- planes were intercepted. Another thing which was typical of a doodlebug is that it would go so many miles and we would hear this droning voi -- noise. You knew what it was, but when the noise stopped, that\u2122s when the agony went of f in all of us, because we didn -- it was coming down, but we didn\u2122t know where it would come dow n and explode. It was really meant to go another 35 miles to London from where we were . But the way of life for everybody was very difficult. We had the air raids at night or during the day and people would rush into shelters. And the food was rationed so that it was very minima l, what everyone received. But being at The Beacon, the food was less than minimal. They did not give us, I think, what we were entitled to, which was maybe one egg a month, because I don\u2122t remember ever, ever eating an egg, or ever seeing fresh fruit like an orange or banana.

The letters dwindled because they were still sending them to Switzer land, and they would be forwarded to my brother or my aunt, and then eventually they would come to me. Th e letters were always sa d, it was always we are trying to get out, we are trying to get by. And my mother would us e the phrase very often lorg zundt, only -- only good health. In other words, she was hoping that they would stay healthy. I know that because I donated all the letters from my parents, the originals, to the museum in Washington, D.C., and -- except for the first and last letter, which we kept. My daughter-in-law in Florida has the first and last letters. The firs t one was particularly meaningful to me, and the last letter from my parents said we have to be at the dorm in Halberstadt -- the dorm being the big church in the center of th -- of town, at something like five o\u2122clock in the morning, or something -- something very early, and we may take with us only a rucksack. And I understand that all the Jews assembled there, and that was in the last letter from my parents. They had to then give up their keys, their house keys, and they were deported. This was all unknown to us because my brother and I were in England and we only heard about that later on, after the war, and from the little museum in Halberstadt, and they have the information from some of the soldiers in Halberstadt, and that is how they received the names of all the people who were deported. But you know, the Germans were very accurate about their recordkeeping, so they 40 have records of names and so forth, and that is all recorded now on that monument in Halberstadt."

The Beacon being rather an isolated building on a hill, the area is called Rusthall in Tunbridge Wells, and it\u2122s still called The Beacon. It is now like a pub, and a bed and breakfast both. So it\u2122s well taken care of by a young couple at this time, because after our reunion of children being in England for 50 years, we went onto The Beacon, and visited The Beacon. And at that time some of the village boys were invited to come over. These village boys are now in their fi -- 60\u2122s, but we knew them as kids. And they would come and visit us by climbing through the basement window, which was ground level. And when we heard a matron coming down the stairs, they would jump out of the window and disappear. So we had a very good, but very innocent time."

            "answer": "I believe the year would have been 1946 approximately, because I was now out of the school of arts and crafts in Tunbridge Wells, and had to take a job in London. And the young Mr. Hayward, who was this artist, said to me, would I like to live with them -- of course with the okay of his young wife. And I didn't know where I was going to live, so that sounded fine to me. They said they would live -- they were living in the vicinity of London, a little on the outskirts. So then I started my job in London at Jaquemar, this very, very fancy dress house, which gave 42 me a very, very good background in basic knowledge of dressmaking, which came in extremely useful later on in my life."

I don\u2122t know the exact date any more, but I was with them when the war ended, so I was still going to work in London, and being that I was working in London at Jaquemar, my brother was also working in London, not too far away, and we would le -- meet at lunch time, and we would meet at a restaurant called Lions, Lions Corner House, and my brother woul d always pay for my lunches. I really d -- earned very, very little money. It wasn\u2122t even enough to pay for the train fare and staying with the Haywards. But the Haywards had a very pos itive influence upon my life. For instance, I had had piano lessons in Germany, and they felt that I should continue with my knowledge of music, and made arrangements for me to have piano less ons every week, which I did, and I went to high s -- to further my education in art, I went to an art school at night. So I would work during the day, commute, and then go to an evening art school. So they really influenced my life in continuing my education, and I was very happy staying with them. They were not at all wealthy. They bought me a men\u2122s bike. I know because it had the bar in between, and we used to visit The Beacon, now from London, and we used to bicy cle there. It was 35 miles each way. And Alec and his wife Agnes had a tandem and I had the single men\u2122s bike. So they were slow going uphill, where I would be ahead of them and going downhill they would be much faster. And 35 43 miles in one direction is quite a good trip, but we did this quite regularly and it helped me in having very strong legs to this day."

And that train was hit by a bomb, and they thought I was on it. And I guess the good lord felt that I wa -- he wasn\u2122t ready for me, so here I was saved once more, and it was the train that I had taken on a regular basis, and that day I missed it, the train."

A nd we spent many, many ni ghts in the air raid shelter. The Haywards had a shelter in their home, in the hallway. It was about the size of a ten -- ping pong table, but out of iron, and you would sleep under that ping pong table the moment the air raid siren went off. And it was routine. That could be daytime or nighttime. Of course, everything was a blackout at all times. No light s from the outside, you co uld not see which house had a light on. And they had air raid wardens walking around, checking each of the houses. It was a way of life. And in London, many people ju st bedded down in the underground, which is the subway system. They had bunks, one on top of the other, and parents, rather than dragging 44 their children out in the middle of the night, would just put them to bed in the subway. And they would be there every night, occupying these beds. There were hundreds and hundreds of them."

And we were still hoping that there would be a sign of our parents somewhere. We thought because of lack of communication during the whole war, that maybe they were hiding somewh ere. Maybe in Russia or Poland, or somewhere. We did not know. But we were not fortunate. Ho wever, many of The Beacon girls were reunited with their parents.

At the time there was a newspa per in New York, and I believe it is still in existence, called Aufbau, A-u-f-b-a-u. The Aufbau also played a role in my life. First day I found a furnished room in Washington Heights, which cost five dollars a week. So, it was a walk-up apartment and I just had this tiny little room there on 180 th Street, with a family. And of course, I needed to look for a job. So I went to an unemployment agency, the regular U.S. unemployment agency, and there was a very nice gentlema n there who was sort of fascinated by my background, which I did not find particularly fascinating at all. And he helped me to get my first job in sketching bridal gowns. S -- my first job was on 85 th Street, very near the mu -- Metropolitan Museum of Art. And people would expl ain to me what they wa nt, a dress with lots of buttons down the back and puffed sleeves or whatever, and I would sketch it. And I was a pretty good sketcher, and I had a -- quite a nice background from the school of art in -- in Tunbridge Wells. And there was a showroom and people who would make the dresses, but my particular job was to sketch. Later on I would get a second job, and a third job, and each one was an improvement over the job I had before. I al ways earned more money, and I did quite well money-wise. I know I started with 35 dollars a week, and my brother and I thought that that was incredible. We thought we were so well-to-do. At that time I guess it was not too bad, because my room was only five dollars, so we did fine. And my brother and I sa w each other regularly. He also took a furnished room in Washington He ights, we were near each other. And we were always very, very close in our loving each other, and -- but my brother felt responsible for me. And it wasn\u2122t too much longer, when I visite d my other uncle, Dr. Friedel Lusch, he was a gynecologist in New York, on 92nd Street and Columbus Avenue. And I went to visit Friedel Lusch, Uncle Friedel, and there were other people there, a Mrs. Lowenstein and her daughter, 47 and a young man, and this young man was Jerry. I t hought he might be the husband of the other young woman, turned out that that was his first cousin, and that was the aunt he lived with when he came to America, also on the kindertransport. And that\u2122s where I first met my husband Jerry, and I was only here maybe a month or not much mo re and Jerry has not left me out of his sight from then until today, and we are married 58 years."

We also don\u2122t know what happened to Opa in Halberstadt, the one who lived above us. I believe he was sent to like a nursing home, but we were trying to find his grave when we were there a few years ago, and we could not find it. We found the grave of his wife, Zelma Cohn, and it\u2122s in the Jewish cemetery in Halberstadt. It\u2122s written in Hebrew, and a rabbi, a present rabbi from Berlin made a rubbing of the gravestone and sent us the translation, which was really quite warm a nd heartwarming. So that was Ze lma Cohn, born Lusch. And that 52 gravestone is there in Halberstadt, but we could not find Opa, Hugo Cohn, we don\u2122t know where he was buried."

We lived in a small house in Middle Village, and they grew up with all the other neighborhood Amer ican children. Went to school at the public school in -- in the park, very close to home. And actually the conversation never came up, even though my husband and I both sp eak German fluently, we really did not use 55 the German language. My husband was also born in Germany, he was born in G\u00f6ttingen, but at home we just spoke English, with one excepti on. When Jerry\u2122s mother, my husband\u2122s mother came to America after the war a nd I met her, she didn't speak English, she would speak German. And I always understood it, but I hadn\u2122t used the language for so many years in England. So she would say well, why don\u2122t you answer me in Germ an? And I really hesita ted to speak German, but the more she insisted and the more sh e spoke German, I unde rstood everything, and eventually I would speak to her, so the children would hear a little German here and there, when -- you know, when the grandmother came to visit, which was every weekend. But my husband and I only speak English at home. But a ga - regarding whether we spoke about our childhood and kindertransport, I didn\u2122t. I don\u2122t think the children were even aware of any of this, except that we visited the Allens with the children when they were about five and six years old, we went to England and visited the Allens, who were, of course, very, very proud to have me back and to see our children, and they were very, very kind to us. And at one time they came to America and visited us in our little house in Middle Village . So there was always this connection, and I told you that I am still in touch with the granddaughter, very much so. And just a year ago the granddaughter, with her seven children, came to vi sit our son in Connecticut, and then to our house. So it\u2122s like part of my lif e is definitely in England."

But the time did come when they started posing questions. And the first question I remember, the boys are only 14 months apart in age, one of them saying at Thanksgiving time, they were now in public school, saying, everybody is going to their grandmother\u2122s and 56 grandfather\u2122s house, why don\u2122t we have grandparents? So now the question came from the children, and I told them in short that there was this bad man in Germany, and because of that I came to England, and I said, you know, Pop and Ma in England, and of course they did, because they had visited and they knew them very well by now. And I sai d, well that\u2122s why I came to England. But I would make it very short, I neve r dwelt on it, and neither did my husband. It was just, when they asked a question they got a real answer, but we never talked much about politics, we just wanted them to have a happy childhood."

            "answer": "All right. Well, it \u2122s just a -- a little over a year ago, in 2005, and we\u2122re now in 2006, I received a phone call from this woman in Halberstadt, Jutta Dick at the Moses Mendelssohn academy, and she said, \ufb01Lilly, I had a phone cal l from somebody called Horst Hesser, do you know Horst Hesser?\ufb02 And I said, no, I don\u2122t. She sa id, \ufb01Do you know Horst?\ufb02 So I thought about it, and I said, \ufb01Well the only Horst I know is th e doll I had. My little doll I played with in -- in Germany was a boy doll, and his name was Horst.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01That\u2122s the only Horst I know.\ufb02 But I must have called that Horst after -- that doll after somebody, somebody I liked, but I couldn\u2122t remember. She said, \ufb01Well, Horst Hesser is trying to reach you, and he says he has some items that belong to you.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01No, that can\u2122t be, I -- I just don\u2122t know anybody.\ufb02 So she said, \ufb01Well, he said he has certain belongings from yo ur parents and he has looked for you all his life, and he just found you through the internet, through the computer.\ufb02 Well, apparently Horst Hesser has a son-in-law and he is very creative with the computer and Horst has said to him at various times, could you put in the name of either Vann a Cohn or Lilly Cohn and see what happens. And 57 over the years, nothing happened. And Horst said that when he went to Halberstadt, he would always ask, what happened to that family, C ohn, and anyone he would ask would say, we don\u2122t know, or we\u2122d rather not talk about that. So this time this son-in-law put in the name Lilly Cohn, Halberstadt, and it came out that it said, Lilly Cohn, Halberstadt is now Lillyan Rosenberg, tour guide in New York. So he was extremely excited a nd went to see his father-in-law and told him, I think I found her. So one thing led to another, they contacted the guide association in New York and said, do you know Lillyan Rosenberg? And they said, oh sure we do, because of course, they speak different languages and I did tours in German. They said she was president of the multilingual guide association. He said, well how can we reach her? So they told him how they could reach me, and that is how Horst calle d Halberstadt and she told me to get in touch with Horst. So now I called him, and one f -- mo rning I called, and of course my German is fluent, and I said to him, \ufb01Here is Lilly Cohn.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Are you the little girl I played with?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I don\u2122t kn ow, I can\u2122t remember.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Well, if you are the one,\ufb02 he said, \ufb01our parents were very good friends and they used to have coffee and cake at your house, and you and I would play under the table and do some crayoning or play.\ufb02 I must have been all of seven years old at the time. And sh -- he said, \ufb01While I am speaking to you, I have paintings in front of me, and these paintings were done by your mother, and they have your mother\u2122s signature.\ufb02 And so I said, \ufb01That can\u2122t be.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Yes, I have several items from your parents.\ufb02 And he told me that his father and my father were doing busine ss together. So I believe that after my father\u2122s store was closed, he still sold linens by going to people\u2122s houses, or business, I don\u2122t know. But with a suitcase I remember him getting on the train and that was after the store was closed, before concentration camp. So apparently he knew this family well. So ma -- now --"

            "answer": "They now live in a different town called Schwer in, but at the time, his father and my parents lived like 10 miles apart. He -- the father of Hors t and family, they lived outside of Halberstadt, a real farm country. Like we ha ve Pennsylvania Dutch, real country. There\u2122d be one house here, and a half a mile away, another house. That\u2122s how his parents lived. So apparently, during the war, my father said to Horst\u2122s father, would you come and get some of our precious belongings in case we ever have to leave our home and would you hold them for safekeeping? So apparently, Horst\u2122s father, at great risk to his own life, came in the middle of the night with, I think a horse and buggy, and took furniture and carpeting and silver and paintings, a s -- little statue, and various items from my parent\u2122s home, and he drove them during the night because nobody would see him where they live, and he hid them in a barn. So these items were hidden in a barn all the war years. And of course, eventually, my parents had to leave home, their ho -- our home. And after the war, Horst\u2122s father said to his two sons, who were now teenagers, \ufb01We have belongings from a Jewish family, the family Cohn, and I\u2122m trying to find them, and if I don\u2122t find them, I want you to promise me that you will always look for them, and we have to return these items to that family.\ufb02 So I couldn\u2122t belie ve what was happening. But it was just a year ago in July that we made arrangements then to co me to Halberstadt and that Horst and his wife would come to Halberstadt, and then my husba nd was coming with me, of course. And the two sons said, \ufb01Well then, we\u2122ll go too, because if you\u2122re going, we\u2122ll go.\ufb02 And the three grandchildren said, \ufb01Well if you\u2122re all going, we want to go, too.\ufb02 So on July of nine -- of 2 - \u201a05, we all arranged to be in Germany. So it was the two sons, one daughter-in-law, and the three grandchildren and my husband and I, we all went to Halberstadt and we met Horst and his wife. They are also in their 70\u2122s, like I am, but he\u2122s a little bit older, and they\u2122re a very charming couple. And we spent a few days with them in Ha lberstadt. And there were great festivities, if 59 one may call it that, because there was the press, and television and newscasters, all at the museum where this took place. And some student s, and outsiders. It got a tremendous lot of publicity and Horst returned the paintings to me, a nd a whole set of silverware with the initial C for Cohn, and a little statue. It took quite awhile, but eventually it reached our home in New York, and we are now blessed to have the paintings and the silver and the statue in our home."

And she sa id, would we be willing to address some of the students of the vicinity, and it was mainly b ecause of the diary I kept, because I sent a copy of the diary, I think it\u2122s about 66 pages, I sent a copy to the museum in Halberstadt, because they\u2122re trying to show what life was like in that community. And that ta gabu, this diary of mine, which I have right here, became a textbook for the students in the area. And they studied my background and the way of life in Halberstadt. So she asked if I would address students and come over there and s -- that they could a -- meet somebody and speak to me directly. So my friend Ruth Oppenheimer, who I mentioned befo re, and her husband, and my husband Jerry and I, and one lady from Israel, her naveda -- name is Judith Beerun, and she goes to Halberstadt fr -- quite frequently from Israel, she is older than I am. We were all in Halb erstadt together, and we 62 had interviews, mostly at the museum and some times at a school where students of a -- an age about 16 to 20 -- not the youn -- very youngest, could ask questions, anything they wanted. And being that my German is quite fluent, they -- they would speak to me and give -- and I would answer their questions. I also offered them that if they had any questions that they could write to me and I would answer their lett ers, which indeed I did. One of the letters which is outstanding in my mind is where a young student wrote to me, of course all in German, I was born in Germany, and wherever I go in the world, wherever my parents and I travel , people always refer to us as Nazis. What can I do about it? After a ll, I wasn\u2122t even born. What can I help what my grandfather may have done, and so forth. So I gave it quite a bit of thought how to answer such a letter. And I wrote back and I answered every letter, but this came up in several versions. And I said, you know, you are not responsible for things that happened before you were born. But you\u2122re very responsible for all the decisions you make in your lifet ime. And therefore, all I can tell you is that you do not have to feel guilty for things that happened before your time, but be very sure that whatever decisions you make in your life will be the right decision, and not only because of the majority doing it. So I ho-hope that I gave the youngsters the proper advice."

I cannot forgive th em for that, but I cannot hold it against all the Germans, because I think they\u2122re doing the best they can to help Israel, and I have found many, many positive things, including some very, very good pe ople, including this Horst 63 and his wife. They had, for instance, the various pieces of silver for my parents, which my parents might have hidden somewhere, I don\u2122t know, and that was distributed among the various members of the family. And yet when they heard that we were coming to Germany, they all gave it back and we have all these things from all the various members.

And he told us the weirdest stories. I mean, he\u2122s quite a character, but they \u2122re very, very good people. Yes, he was in the German army, and it wasn\u2122t until the war was over that his father told his sons that they have the items belonging to my family."

Also, I had one painting in my suitcase for the Allens, so it was a pr -- a pr -- a present from my mother to the Allens when I came to England, so there was always one small painting, which is in our son\u2122s house, the Allens gave it to me. And now we have the two big paintings which Horst gave 64 us, and of course it has changed our whole atmosphere in our ho me, they just look like they belong there."

The other one is -- the very large one, is a big church in Stargard in Pommern. Hors t\u2122s wife did some research by going to various libraries to locate which church could that be, and she located it as the church in Stargard in Pommern. And the smaller picture is the fish mart in Halberstadt, which is still there now. There is a round fountain in the center of town, and that seems to be qui te a landmark with Bucco from Halberstadt in the background on the new town hall. Because the new town hall was bombed, but they must have had Bucco hidden somewhere, Bucco is still there."

But when we got to my parent\u2122s home, and they told me this is Westendorf, and the exact address, the post office is still there, but vis-\u00e0-vis the post office where my parent\u2122s home was is now a very ugly build ing which was built by the Russians in their style of building, which was very unattractive. Like a factory type house. So I did not associate with 65 that building at all. I had no feeling for that building at all. So that which I was afraid of, never happened."

Cause no one could have ever predicted that over 70 years would -- would come -- go by and someone woul d come up and say, I have belongings from your parents. I mean, it was something that I could not have even dreamt up. It\u2122s just so unpredictable. And then they turned out to be such warm and ki nd people. So that I speak to Horst every week, even it\u2122s a year now that we are back from over ther e. And his son-in-law writes to us on the email, so we know what is happening. In fact, my husband and I are trying to figure out what we can do for them, and we\u2122v e come up with various suggestions. We\u2122d like them to come and visit us, for instance, in New York, but he has said it\u2122s too far, his doctor would not let him fly that far. So then we came up with different suggestions, but we have not gotten together yet. I think eventually we will fly to Germany and invite them somewhere, or maybe meet again in Halberstadt, something like that."

And to the best of my knowle dge, the whole picture, in my mind, was done in Hebrew letters. Because I can remember standing in front of that picture, since I was always interested in art, sayi ng how can somebody make a picture by using only letters? So that\u2122s what I remembered about th e picture. So he said, \ufb01Oh, you mean the Moses picture with the 10 commandments?\ufb02 I said yes. I said, \ufb01That\u2122s the only thing -- I wonder where that is, because if it\u2122s only in Hebrew letters, there can\u2122t be many of those around, it must be somewhere.\ufb02 So he said, \ufb01Oh, my sister had it.

So, I contacted that particular museum and was in touch with Dr. Simon and told him that I am the sole survivor of my parents fa -- direct family, and I heard that the picture has been donated to the synagogue, or the museum, and I would like them to know that I am here, and I would like to have the picture returned. He was very, very evasive. Eventually I made an appoint ment with him to meet with him while we were on our trip to Europe last year when we met Hors t. And I made a date to meet him at the museum with Jutta. And I spent a whole hour with him. I said, look, I have sent you my birth certificate, which is from Halberstadt and you know that my parents are Ernst, Marguerita Cohn, and you know that the picture was given to you by Horst\u2122s sister. And he never denied having the picture, but for almost a year we have been talking back and forth. And he told me then that the museum has never returned anything to anyone, because if they would return that picture, then other people would re -- want their belongings back, to o. I didn't see it in the museum because I think they had it in a cellar somewhere, it was not exhib ited. We tried very, very hard for him to give it up. Jutta would go over fr-from Halber stadt and collect it, and there were all kinds of legal things 68 back and forth. Eventually our son from Flor ida contacted his senator, who contacted the American consulate in Berlin. And the American consulate in Berlin contacted Dr. Simon and said, why are you not returning this to Lillyan Rosenberg? She is an immediate heir of that painting. Then he softened a little bit, he did not want to have problems with the American government, because now the government got in volved. And a little while ago, approximately four weeks ago, he said it -- a yo -- to the man at the American consulate in Berlin that all Jutta has to do is make an arrangement with him and come and pick it up. So Jutta has picked it up, it is now in Halberstadt and will be on view at the little museum of the Moses Mendelssohn academy for awhile, and then we will make a rrangements to have it shipped to our home."

            "answer": "Yes. And this way it gives some publicity to the area. And the little museum is doing very well. It\u2122s getting tourists from all over the world. And one of the things that the little museum has been able to do -- for instance, when Jutta was here in New York about four weeks ago, and she stayed with us, she told me that one of the pr ofessors from a university here in New York, her family is from Halberstadt, she thought she was alone in the world. Her back -- background, her 69 family name was h -- Hirsch. Because there was Hirsch Kupva and Hirsch something else in Halberstadt. So when she got in touch with Jutta, Jutta told her, you know, you have a lot of members of your family in Israel, which she did not know. So this woman by the name of Hirsch, here in New York, did not know that she had family in Israel. They all met again in Halberstadt. So the little museum there is getting people together from different parts of the world. And this year they invited grandchildren, that would have been like our age grandchildren, to come there and write about gen ealogy of their family.
