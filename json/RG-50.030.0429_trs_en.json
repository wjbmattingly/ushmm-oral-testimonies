            "answer": "Yes, well. My name is Gisela Feldman and my maiden name was Klapl, K-L-A-P-L, and I was born on the 18th of September, 1923, in Berlin, Germany."

            "answer": "I was born in 1923, as I said, and so I had 10 years without Hitler. My parents originally came from Poland, the Austrian-Hungarian empire of Poland, at the age of 15, so by the time I was born, they had been in Germany for about twenty years. Du ring the first 10 years, what I can remember is people still had housing shortages and that was a result of the fi rst world war, and it was very difficult to get a decent flat. Bu t that affected everybody, it wasn\u2122t something that we felt we were singled out for that. But when it got to some of 1 932, I was nine then, I b ecame aware of the fact, there was some sort of tension between the Nazi Party and the Communists. I remember marches in the street where people beat each other up. And in the block of flats where I lived, a person was even shot because they we re demonstrating against the Nazi Part y. So that in a nine year old, aroused some sort of fear that something was about to happen."

            "answer": "Yes I did. In fact my sister and I were the only Jewish childr en in the school. And during the sort of beginnings of th e Nazi party I had a very good teacher a nd he kept telling all the children that I was no different from anybody else and they had to treat me very we ll and all that. But that didn\u2122t 2 go on for too long because when I reached the age of 11 and I had to go to a secondary school, I had to go to a Jewish school b ecause it was very difficult to stay on in a state school."

            "answer": "Well, not a terribly orthodox, but I as a child , I wouldn\u2122t ride on a sh arbot(ph) and I wouldn\u2122t switch the light on. However my father kept his shop open after going to a service in the morning, he came back because we lived in such a Christ ian neighborhood that, you know, we had to keep the shop open on a Saturday. And our customers really didn\u2122t stay away from us until an SS man stood guard outside the s hop and told people not to buy from Jews. And ev en then, some of them were very brave they came in and we had one particular custom er across the road from us, a Catholic baker, and they also were n\u2122t very fond of the Nazis, and you know ba kers have to get up very early to bake their bread, and they found somebo dy dobbing(ph) their shop windows, friends of the Jews, and so they just p oured buckets of water from the balcony over them. So that was really a very brave act in the climate."

            "answer": "We had a grocery store. Well, once or twice my father was beaten up in the dark when he came home from the shop. And th en things got a little difficult. But you see, wh en you\u2122re sort of 12, 13, you don\u2122t quite realize the dangers that were going on. But we di d know of people whose fathers disappeared or they used to go and sleep in other people\u2122s houses, so when the party came to pick 3 them up they wouldn\u2122t be at home, they couldn\u2122t be found. So yes, things we re getting very sort of disturbing. But you know, people always say to me, \ufb01Why did peop le not leave early on?,\ufb02 and the only theory I can have is, if you ar e very poor you can go because yo u\u2122ve got nothing to lose, and if you were rich, you know at the be ginning you were allowed to take your money out w ith you, but if you are a middle-class person then you sort of value a little bit of security. So that\u2122s the only explanation I have because we didn\u2122t leave until 39 which was the last moment almost."

            "answer": "No, my parents really I think pr otected us quite a lot. They didn \u2122t show their fears a great deal. And our final moment really came when my father was deported in 1938. I don\u2122t know whether you know that. My father had a Polish passport and at that time the Pole s said that anybody who hadn\u2122t returned to Poland for a number of years wa s going to lose their passports, and I think the Nazis got a little bit worried that they were going to be left wi th all these people with Polish nationality and they picked up all the men during the night and just deported them to Poland. And I think that\u2122s when things started really to, for us, to reach a high point where we had to decide to do something, although we had to shut our shop before that so when my father was deported he didn\u2122t have any income anymore."

            "answer": "That was sort of the beginnin g of 38. And they also made me leave school because it was then decided education wasn\u2122t going to be much use to you if you had to go into a co untry where you didn\u2122t speak the language. So people got their children to learn a trade. I went to dress-making school, people became plumbers, an d _____________ and so on because you felt if you had a trade in your hands you didn\u2122t ne ed to know the language. 4"

Because you know there was this word rusenshe n(ph), I don\u2122t know if you\u2122ve come across it. But that\u2122s why you\u2122re not allo wed to have anybody under 50."

            "answer": "Well, that was obviously something, a very we ll kept secret because in October, the 28th of October I think, during the night there is a ring at the door and two men came in civilian clothes actually, and they said to my father , \ufb01Pack your bag, get your passport\ufb02 . And you know that was a very frightening experience and my sister panicked, she\u2122s three ye ars younger than I, and she started shouting at them and they said , \ufb01Well if you don\u2122 t keep quiet we will take you away as well.\ufb02 I must have kept calm because I remember I got up and made sandw iches for my father for him to take the sandwiches. But we didn \u2122t know why or what or where th ey were going to go, they didn\u2122t tell us, and while they were watching my father I ru shed out down the street to go to a phone and phone my uncles to warn them, but a strange man answered the phone so we knew they had also got them. And, then some sort of rumor came about that they had been taken to the railway stations, and then all the women rushed to th e railway station to see if they could still see their husbands or fathers, but we didn\u2122t see our father, but eventual ly we heard from him that he was in Poland. And they had apparently there was some sort of tugof-war between the German s and the Poles because the Poles didn\u2122t want to take them, the Germans wouldn \u2122t let them back, a nd there was a camp where they held all these people which was called bonchin(ph) and but my father still had family in Poland so he and his two br others went to the family. 5"

Our s hop had gone so really there wasn\u2122t much Jewish property for them to destroy. But when we heard about it I walked to my Aunt\u2122s house and yes, you were walking through glass. Y ou know once you neared Jewish sh ops and the synagogue and so on then you could see what had happe ned. That\u2122s why it\u2122s called Crys tal Night, isn\u2122t it? We were walking on glass."

            "question": "In between the time that your father was deported and the time that you were attempting to leave did things get progressively wors e? What was it like for you?",
            "answer": "First of all we were asked to leave our flat, for a German couple, and strangely enough my mother went to court and the judge gave her three months, which was quite unheard of, you know, that he should allow us to stay, and so he gave us three months, and we move d in with my aunt after that whose husband had also been deported. And then my mother started seriously to look around for some place for us to go. Because we had no income. There was no safety anymore. We children couldn\u2122t go to school. So obviously, rather late, but we knew then that we had to leave, because you see even the lot of the German people I think didn\u2122t believe that our friends anyway that he could stay in power. And a lot of the Je wish people who had become so much part of the country and the professi onal people who held jobs in hosp itals and everywhere, nobody could 6 believe that an intelligent nation could allow in a dictator which in a way wasn\u2122t imposed on them, because Hindenburg supported him a nd he really got in by legal means but nobody thought that such a tyranny could go on but they are, that\u2122s wh at happened. And so th en my mother started looking around and by that time it was very diff icult to get a visa to go to any country, and so people took any visa they could get. I know friends of ours went to China and eventually these Cuban visas came up and you had to pay for them with them with foreign currenc y, which really meant you had to smuggle money out of Germ any in order to have dollars to pay for these visas, which my mother did, she smuggled money ou t, and she didn\u2122t even know who it was going to, it was some sort of code name, you know she talked to somebody about uncle so and so, I remember that as a child. And then eventually we bought visas with the foreign currency, and which was supposed to be perfectly legal. And then my mother had to arrange a boat to take us across and she got four passages on the boat called the St. Louis which was meant to sail from Hamburg on May the 13th, which it did. And the Germans a llowed people to come back into Germany providing they were leaving again. It was a sort of transit visa they allowed them. My father applied to come back and the Poles sent the wrong brother back, so my father didn\u2122t make it. And so my father phoned up in tears and he told my mother not to go without him, and she must have been a very determined woman because she said \ufb01I have to take the children out.\ufb02 In any case, there was another boat leaving after ours, the Orinoco and she couldn\u2122t ge t four passages on the next boat, but one she could get, so she was determined to take up three of the passages and my father was going to join us afterwards on the next boat."

But we left on May the 13th and for us youngsters it was really quite an adventure, because this was a luxury liner, and 8 the captain was a wonderful man. He instructed the crew that we had to be treated like anybody else. We had to pay for the return journey, but nobody really sa w anything into that because we all felt the ship was going to come back empty and it was only fair th at they were paid for this. And it was an experience to be on a liner where you had a cinema and a ballroom and a swimming pool, and all the usual games you have on a boat. Obviously very few of us had ever been on a cruise so it was exciting for us youngsters. But my mother never took part in anything. She didn\u2122t worry us, you know. And it mu st have been an awful th ing to leave your place wh ere you\u2122ve lived, and leave a husband behind who didn\u2122t want you to go. My mother had ten marks, which I don\u2122t know how much it would have been then, perh aps twenty dollars or something for the three of us, that is all we were allowed to take out. So sh e must have been terribly worrie d about the future, you know two children, twenty dollars, no job, nothi ng to go back to. And so, but sh e never worried us at all. And during the first 10 days we really had a very good time until we landed and found that things began to go wrong."

            "answer": "The main thing is, we saw so many people with shaven heads. And it ap pears then, we sort of found out they were people let out of concentration camps, they had to sign papers to say they would never return to Germany, they were let out, and these people seemed to take longer to take part in the festivities that were going on, and so on. We had our Friday night services, we had a portrait of Hitler in the ballroom, but the captain allowed us take it off during the servic es and then it had to be put back after the service. It\u2122s very difficult for me now to sa y what I remember as a teenager and what I\u2122ve read since, of course, it\u2122s very difficult to separate these things. Because there was also a book written abou t it, called \ufb01The Voyage of the Damned,\ufb02 but unfortunately I feel 9 it\u2122s a little bit of a soap opera and they made a film of that too. And so I don\u2122t know if I know it from the book I read or whether I really knew it that there were people watching us. The only thing I know is my mother had a cabin on her ow n and one night she woke up and found somebody searching through things and walking around the cabin. And after that she never slept alone again. So I don\u2122t know how much truth there was in it all, that we were being watched."

Well, once again we thought that was quite normal, you know, it is always deep enough for the boat to go right into the harbor and we had stopped outside, and the Cuban police came on and the immigration people, and then suddenly the atmosphere changed and we were told, \ufb01not today, not today, meyenian a(ph) tomorrow, tomorrow,\ufb02 but tomorrow never came, and then people were getting anxious but nobody ever gave up hope. You know we were so near America we never thought anybody would allow us to go back to Germany. I mean nine hundred and odd people that\u2122s really nothing is it , a drop in the ocean."

And I believe the American Joint(ph) worked very hard for us, and they wa nted to pay money for us, but I think it was more a political issue because I think whatever they offered it was decided not to accept the money and not to accept us. Whatever reason they could give for us, I really don\u2122t know, I really only know what I have heard since, so I don\u2122t know what the political issue was that why they wouldn\u2122t have us. And then we just went off and cruised along th e coast of Miami and Florida and the gun boats came out in case somebody jumped overbo ard and swam ashore you know, and so.

Yes, well ev entually when we had to go back towards and we knew we were go ing back towards Germany, as fa r as I know several other people tried to commit suicide, and we had a group of young people ch ecking all the cabins to watch people, and it was a very grim atmosphere then of course. And when we were off the coast of England suddenly we hear d that Belgium, Ho lland, France, and England were prepared to take a quarter each of the people. And obviously a lot of people wanted to go England, because the other countries were to near Germany. And my father obviously kn ew what was going on because he sent us a telegram and said \ufb01Choose England.\ufb02 Bu t really one didn\u2122t have a choice. They decided where people should go and people\u2122s different nationalities they ha d different quotas how many people they would take in of each nationality and my mother told me to go and speak to the Immigration, English Immigration Officer because I had learned English at school. How good my English was I really don\u2122t know, but I did talk to the man and wh ether that had any influence or not I really don\u2122t know. But luckily we ended up in England. But the bo at first landed in Belgium, and the people that were staying in Belgium obviously got off and the others were transferred by trains to Holland and France, and we were put on a sort of cargo ship and taken to England. And we\u2122ve heard since that at the time Gobels(ph) pu blished in the newspapers you see nobody wants samiva(ph) at least we ar e building camps for them."

Yes, that was towards the end of June then, yes, yes, and I stayed there until September and then I met a family on the beach and they asked me if I would come and look after their children for them, of 6 and 11, and I was getting in English money, 25 p(ph) a week and they we re offering me a pound a week or so mething, and so I obviously accepted, ended with going back to London so I accepted that job and the ch ildren were as I said six and a half and 11, and I was 15, and they asked me to do the cooking and the cleaning, and if the children couldn\u2122t go to school they asked me to write the letters to teachers, so somebody must have had great fun reading my writing, but still."

But, and my husband asked me to, well, this man asked me to dance, and then saw me home afterwards and told me that if I was still going out with him two months later I wo uld marry him and that was it.

It was very difficult to find your way around because in those days we still had these famous Lo ndon fogs that you only see in Sherlock Holmes films nowadays and I can rememb er ending up in somebody else\u2122s yard at the back of the house because it really was quite impos sible to see and find you r way around. On the other hand one felt very, very safe. You know you\u2122d walk around with out being able to see anybody and people would talk to you and as a yo ung girl, you never felt af raid to walk about."

            "answer": "Well one didn\u2122t really know how horrible it a ll was, you know. And we still heard from my father for some time. But I\u2122d just like to back when we first came to England. My mother couldn\u2122t speak English so she went to the East end of Lo ndon, which was the Jewish part in those days, and she could speak Yiddish, and she went from place to place, from shop to shop, and asked somebody if they could guarantee for my fath er to come out, because he c ould come if you had somebody that would guarantee for you, and in fact she found somebody who of fered him a job, and his papers were being processed and the war broke out, so he lo st his second chance ther e. So I\u2122m only saying 16 that just to add again what a brave woman my mother was, maki ng a decision for us to leave without him with two children a nd very little money, and then she immediately set about trying to get him out, and so she wa s really a very active woman because we relied a lot on her before we left Germany too because when we had our business eventually wholesaler s wouldn\u2122t deliver to Jewish shops, so my mother used to get up at 5:00 in the morning and go to the markets and bring in the eggs and the butter so we could still sell the stuff in the, in the shop. So she really was a very, very strong, active woman. But now getting back to after the wa r started, we heard from my father until about 1940, because we had family in Romania and in Switzerland so he could send the mail via these two addresses. Just recen tly I came across a postcard from him actually and which I think historically is quite interesting because he gives his address in Poland, which was, the town was Gesshue(ph) and it says \ufb01Germany\ufb02 and in brackets \ufb01Formally Poland.\ufb02 So in effect you see once the Germans invaded Poland the address had to be Germany. It is interesting, isn\u2122t it? Until I looked through all the stuff my mother left behind, I didn\u2122t realize how really historically interesting that must be that they had to write their address \ufb01Germany,\ufb02 and in brackets \ufb01Formally Poland.\ufb02"

And my husband actually he died three year s ago but before that went back to Poland because apparently they have quite a few archives there too, to see if he could fi nd out what happened to my family, but they had records of people who died a natu ral death, but not records of peop le who were eventually sent away or deported so we ne ver found out what happened."

So, I seemed to have, as I say, learned it very quickly, because I can remember after I got married being ill, and the doctors saying to my husband, \ufb01That\u2122s a real Londoner you\u2122ve got there, is n\u2122t it?\ufb02 So I must have lost my accent fairly quickly too."

But it was such a normal thing in those days. You never felt that you had been hard done by or you did mo re than you should have done. I think we often felt very sad about my moth er. You don\u2122t realize until it happ ens to you. My mother had 18 19 years of married life and when we were youngsters we thought that was a long time, but obviously it isn\u2122t a long time. And so she really had a very hard time. We often felt sorry for her, but she was never a miserable person, and all sh e said was \ufb01I just want to see my daughters married,\ufb02 and when she saw her daughters married, \ufb01I ju st want to see my grandchildre n,\ufb02 you know, so really there\u2122s always people always hope for more .
