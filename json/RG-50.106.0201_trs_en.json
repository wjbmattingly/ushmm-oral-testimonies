            "answer": "But you know this was only a village school. It had only four classes for eight grades. And when I finished my fifth grade, my mother felt that I was a smart girl, that I should go to high school. So she inquired the next city to our, where we were was called Pil sen, Michaela comes from and so she went to a school a German school and the principal said I have to write a little exam which I did. And I went there to school but even so it only was 18 kilometers from our village. I couldn\u2122t do that. You know there was no transportation and the horse and buggy I couldn\u2122t do that twice a day. So my mother found a family where I was boarding. That means when I was 12 years old, I already left home. But you know I used to go to school and give lecture s on the Holocaust and I would tell the children that at 1 2 years of age, I would be already on my own and they said oh how horrible. And I would say well it wasn\u2122t so horrible. I became very self -sufficient and I had to look after myself and I felt very important. And well I was taught from when I was very young to be self -sufficient . My mother would send me on a train when I was six years old to visit an uncle and aunt who had no children in southern Bohemia. And I wasn\u2122t afraid at all. They put me on the train and I was the whole day on the train and on the other side my uncle would be waiting for me and I had absolutely no fear. You Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 7 November 29, 2012 know when you grow up in a village, it is different like in the city because in the village you don\u2122t have \u0152 well we did have burglars, they burgled our store but I wasn\u2122t afraid. First of all there was maybe one or two cars and one of them was when our doctor from the next village. And he came through the village like a crazy guy so you\u2122d say go away, go away quickly because the gonzerit [ph] is coming. You know even the chickens and the geese were running away on the street. You know in front of our house was a pond. And as children we would go swimming there. Nobody taught us. We just went in the water and started first with one leg down and then we just lifted the other leg and that\u2122s how we were swimming. And in winter it froze over and we would be skating on it. But I was, I didn\u2122t have a really proper skate. My mother had a pair of skates. Can you imagine from the turn of the century. They were iron skates and you attached them to your shoes you know like you had a key and you had to turn it. And I would put them on in front of our house and by the time I was at the pond I lost them about three times. But my brother, he was very good at it and he won the special skate and he told my mother you buy me, Kanotski [ph]. And these are already good skates and they had little, like little teeth in the front. And as a matter of fact one day he fell into the water. Because we ha d inns and the inns would take the ice from the pond, from the summer so that the beer would be cold in their cellar. And overnight it would freeze over and let\u2122s say there was a little snow so you couldn\u2122t tell where they took out the snow, the ice. And one day my brother crossed the pond and he fell in and we were standing in the window, my mother and I. W e were absolutely going crazy because you could see him going up and down and up and down. And then a young man came and he lie down on the ice and he rescued him but he had pneumonia and pleurisy because he was in that icy water."

And you know me. That belonged to the cell at Lavan and anyway w ithin ten days I got a phone call from him. I was so excited. He said yes, yes that\u2122s me. And unfortunately a few, I was in touch with him all the time. And when I went on the marches at Lavan the last time in 204, I met him with his wife in Jerusalem and I was now in contact with him emailing. But his email stopped. And I sent him a wish for Rosh Hashanah and I didn\u2122t get an answer and I started phoning him and there was nobody there. The phone was ringing, ringing, ringing. So yesterday I phoned Israel. I phoned Beit Terezin and I asked about him and they were telling me that a few days ago he had, was his funeral. So he was in my fotsa [ph] in the Zionist organization.

So some people then got visas and went to England. Very few. Some, America had only had quotas so they didn\u2122t take us. And Mr. Roosevelt didn\u2122t want us because he was running for a second term so he couldn\u2122t use us. And some, a few people went to Cuba, to Guatemala, to Quito you know and South America. And they would go to a priest and the priest would give them a paper that they are Catholic and that\u2122s how they got to South America. And since Eichmann couldn\u2122t get rid of Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 20 November 29, 2012 us so he had to find a place where to send us. So he found this place called Terezin or Theresienstadt in the northeast of Prague. Before that he couldn\u2122t wait that long. So in October 1941 the first transports were sent, five of them, a thousand persons each to the Lodz ghetto. That was the beginning. And then they sent a young, about 450 young men to Terezin to prepare the camp you know to make bunks and the kitchen had to be \u0152 because it was a, it was a military time and so they prepared it and then the first transport to Terezin went in December 41. So then we knew that we will be moved. But you know nobody had any idea what it was like, where we are going t o go, what\u2122s going to be and you know I didn\u2122t go \u0152 the school stopped.

Becaus e if they would have caught me they could put me into jail. And my poor uncle and aunt they were on pins and needles because it was five to eight and I still wasn\u2122t home. And so I arrived maybe one minute past eight and my poor uncle was standing already in the door. My aunt must have given orders that he should give me a, give me one you know. And so they decided that they cannot take this Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 21 November 29, 2012 because it\u2122s you know \u0152 and doing terrible things to them. And you know I\u2122m 14 years old or 15. You know you want to be with the young people and you don\u2122t take th ese things so serious. And so they asked my mother that she should find a place to send me somewhere. So my mother went to the Jewish community and the social services and says I have a daughter and I cannot keep her. Perhaps you have a place where you coul d place her. So they did place me with young women. It was a women\u2122s shelter. But most of them, they\u2122re a little older and they were not of very good repute. And they did things which I really didn\u2122t like and I felt, I went to school from there.

And I went there and he says well we have now a home for young girls and boys and we will place you there. And these were children from a town called Ostrova , where their fathers were sent to Poland to work. The Jewish fathers. You know. They took all the Jewish men and they sent them into what\u2122s called Nisco . And so the children were sent to Prague and there was, we were in two apartment house, in two different apartments . Like a large apartment . In one were the girls and then the other one were the boys. And we just got our food there. But the food was hardly any food. And I got extremely thin. And they became worried, so they found two families where I went for lunch, two lunches a week so I shouldn\u2122t get so skinny. And that\u2122s when I still went to school. And so then I was sent to another home. You know how you are being shuttled from one end, from one place to another. And the transports were going already. And my mother and my brother, even so, my brother lived in an orphanage and my mother lived with her sister but when the transport was called, my mother and brother went together with, in August of 42 they went to Terezin. And I went to Terezin on the ninth of September I believe, 1942, with Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 22 November 29, 2012 transport BS and my number was 992. I remember that very well. And I worked then. I came there. I knew someone a young man and I worked in the hospital, a nurse , as a nurse\u2122s aide. My mother worked also as a nurse and as a matter of fact we had typhoid and she worked in the hospital where the children had typhoid. And my brother he was very young then. He was 15. He was making toys for children. Wooden toys. I mean not for the children from Terezin. The Germans took all these things out. They were \u0152 they said, took it to Germany. And you know in Theresienstadt it was again we were the young people and I was already 18, no 17. And we would get together in the loft. We had lofts. You know the Germans kind of didn\u2122t know that we had these lofts and we would get together and we would, there would be somebody who would read poetry. And somebody would sing. I mean it was like what young people are doing. And but the thing was that people started to leave you know. And nobody knew where these people were going and people \u0152 oh yes, a lot of people came from Germany and German Jews were told that they are going to be sent to a bath, you know like serene bath , house ba th you know to a spa and they were allowed to bring their mattresses along. And so they arrived and they said so where is the spa where because they lied to them. And there were loads of old people and they started dying out very fast. And we, the young ones, we kept on going. We had, we did our thing even when the only thing we were afraid, that we would be sent away and nobody knew where you\u2122re going to be sent. They sent you a little piece of paper and you said they said you have to be at 8:00 at t his place and a family . And so my mother was one, got a little paper once. And because she was a nurse, she was looking after peo ple who had typhoid so they took her out again. That was what Gunda Redlich was doing. And then one day she, again she came to me and she said she was called up again and that was September 43 and at night came my brother to see me and he says you know what I am going voluntarily with mother because I cannot let her go by herself. You know my mother wasn\u2122t that old. My mother was in her early 50s. You know that was 43. That means she was 53 years old. And but he said he couldn\u2122t let her go by herself. Anyway so they left and I this is the famous DM transport where I suppose you know that all of them was killed on the eighth of March 1944. But my mother died, she got diarrhea and when somebody got dia rrhea they died from dehydration and my mother died on the fourth of January 1944. And my brother who was in this D M transport , the whole transport was called up and they were killed , all of them close to 4000 Czech Jews were killed on the eighth of March 1944. And so Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 23 November 29, 2012 we were, we were left in that \u0152 in Birkenau and we were waiting when are going to be called up because you see when you arrived in Birkenau, in Auschwitz, Birkenau. You had to sign a paper that after six months it\u2122s going to be special treatment. And our six months would be up very soon. So we knew this is what\u2122s going to happen to us. But in the meantime the Germans sent in more prisoners from Terezin to day to be at th at familial camp to fill it up and then what we didn\u2122t know was the invasion of Europe, you know in 1944 when British and went to Dunkirk and the Canadians and so on, they started invading Europe. We didn\u2122t know that. So one day, I mean, you know there were always rumors and there were rumors that there\u2122s going to be a selection . See in our camp there was never a selection like in the men. Where the men where in D camp there were always selections. And they always took out the people who were old or sick or couldn\u2122t work anymore and they took them out and they gassed them. That happened. I don\u2122t know how often during the week, but it happened very often."

So when we, we had the numbers we again lined up in front of the block and all the women were, the men were in different blocks and the women were in different blocks. And they started marching us to outside of the camp to a building. We had no idea what this building was. When we arrived in that building we had to get undr essed and the only thing we were allowed to keep were our stockings. And they put something on our hair in case we had lice I suppose and they put us under the shower. Now you, we had no idea that these were gas chambers because this was -- you could use this as a shower place or as a gas chamber because the only thing, the difference was when they wanted to kill the people there were little openings in the ceiling and through those ceilings they put in the canisters of Zyklon B and the pebbles would slowly come down and the people would suffocate. You know but this our, it\u2122s around, but we had no idea. So then we took a shower and we were allowed to keep our stockings and there was a bench and they put the stockings there and when it came time for me to get my stockings, they weren\u2122t there. I was hysterical because it was December and I had no stockings. Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 27 November 29, 2012 So of course they took away our shoes. They took away our clothes, the shoes and everything. And but I found another pair, I don\u2122t know whose it was. Probably this person took mine so she left this. And they moves us to another room w here there was a girl and she threw at us clothes. Literally. She had a, you know she had a big bundle of, and she would throw it. And whether you were tall or small or whatever, these horrible clothes. And I think we had, she gave us a little coat or something. And instead of shoes we got these pantofels . You know the wooden clogs. But that was really a savior because if we would have been standing in leather shoes would have been even worse. If they\u2122re wooden at least we didn\u2122t have frozen toes beca use you know we were standing outside for hours being counted in the morning and in the afternoon. And then they started moving, then they marched back to the camp and I was on that block 11. And we were not allowed to go out for \u0152 there was a quarantine of 14 days so \u0152"

You know I mean there\u2122s always somebody who comes in \u0152 the girl who brought the soup that - and we would try to talk to them. I found out that the previous transport with my mother and brother is also there so I found out where my mother was. And when we were allowed to, after the 14 days, when we were allowed to walk around in the camp, I went to look for my mother and she was on block 27.

You sink into it like you had to take a s tep, take your pantofel and put it down and then your foot and so on. I did find my mother and she was in a terrible state already. She had diarrhea. How do I know she had diarrhea ? Because anybody you saw with a white mouth, you know they gave out a powder against diarrhea so I knew that already that she was not well. So I said well I have to do something. So I volunteered to carry the soup, because if you carried them \u0152 they were in barrels. It was heavy like hell. And the two girls were carrying the soup, one in the front and one in the back. We had like poles and over the poles there was some bands and those you put over your shoulders and that\u2122s how you walked. That\u2122s how you carried this. But the thing was when we went to pick up those barrels, you could scrape out the left over soup. Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 28 November 29, 2012 That was, so I said I\u2122m going to go and carry the soup. At least I will be able to give to my mother a little soup. Unfortunately she got so very ill and she died a few days later. So I stopped carrying the soup. And we didn\u2122t do anything. We did not go to work. We just sat, sitting there and most of the time we were standing outside being counted because they counted us in the morning and they counted us in the afternoon and we had to stand there and they had to calculate whether everybody was there. They had to actually count because the dead ones, people were put in the back of the block of the house. They went in the back and they counted the dead. And if the figures weren\u2122t right, they started counting again so we sometimes were standing there for hours."

You had to Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 30 November 29, 2012 say you want to speak to \u0152 so I told the guy who was standing at the door and I said I\u2122d like to speak to Hanush Epstein.

And I never saw him very much because he was painting the chimney. But everybody knew him. He was a very beautiful child and people were just taken by him. And I never thought so. That day you know he was on the other side. I saw him and I called to him and I said I have those mittens. Would you like those mittens. And he said to me where I am going I don\u2122t need any mittens. And during the night from the seventh to the eighth they took them by truck you know and they killed them all that night. And you could hear them singing. They were sin ging. They were singing the Hatikvah . And they were singing the Czech national anthem. And so we knew that we had three more months to live. But as I told you, in the meantime they sent another I think 7,500 people to fill up the camp. And then one day there was rumor that there\u2122s going to be a selection because as I said we never had a selection. That was end of June, I believe. You know because don\u2122t forget, we had no calendar. We, what we did is we made little marks on our bunk and, to see how many more days we have to, you know til we die you know. Kind of we scratched them out. And so if there were rumors because in camps there always are rumors and that there\u2122s going to be a selection. And sure enough, because Mengele used to work in our camp. He did his research on dwarves and twins in our camp. So there came, you know there came the order that we have to line up. It was at the end of the camp, like near the, near where the tracks are now. And you had to get undressed completely and you put your clothes on your right arm because the left arm had the numbers and so you went one after the other. And Mengele decided who is going to live and who is going to die. And you know fate is unbelievable and that\u2122s why I\u2122 m so a fatalist. Because I suffered from psoriasis and just at that time I was completely free of it. I didn\u2122t have any blemish on my body and so when I went through so he chose me to live. Because he just moved with his thumb if you had known what he was doing and they were at the, men they were watching. And when he made one sign you lived and they took you and they wrote down your number. And the ones he \u0152 destined for death, they didn\u2122t need to write down the number.

They were f ixing the roof s of the houses and because they could go from one camp to the other, they were very knowledgeable. They knew what was going on. And they would tell us all the news. And also there were the craziest thing is. You know there was one camp that was all gypsies. That was the D camp. And the gypsies had better food than we had. And they brought the food from the gypsy camp to the hospital to give it to the people who were sick. Now that\u2122s sick, isn\u2122t it. You know you make, yes, people \u0152 but you bring food from the gypsy camp to give people who are sick. I mean this is absurd isn\u2122t it. So they, because they were moving from one camp to the other, they knew all the \u0152 they knew the news Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 32 November 29, 2012 what was going on. They were like our postman. And so we knew a lot of things which were going on. And this also was the time already when all the H \u0152 they built the railroad into the camp because when we came it wasn\u2122t there. So they built that railroad so the trains could come straight into the camp. And we saw these big ra il -- these trains arriving every day. And the camp next to ours, the C camp was empty but then started filling up with girls. And these were the Hungarian girls who they left, kept alive. We would talk to them. I mean probably spoke German to them. I don\u2122t remember because I don\u2122t know Hungarian. And we could kind of talk because the camp \u0152 the division was only wire so you saw what was going on next door and I mean we didn\u2122t go near the wire, because the wire were electrified you know.

We somehow wanted to, you know in Hebrew say Doske [ph], you know what that means . We are going show you. We are going to live. We will manage to survive. So anyway, so when he chose us the next day we were called, all our numbers were called out of th e girls who were chosen. And we were marched to the women \u2122s camp and when we came to the women\u2122s camp, the orchestra was welcoming us. They played for us.

So they were already there a long time. Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 33 November 29, 2012 And when we wanted to go for instance into the wash room you know to get washed. There was a girl standing with the laboir [ph] and she, she let the water strike at us. I mean they didn\u2122t like us because they also knew already that we are not going to stay there. And can you imagine they being there since 1942. Now it\u2122s 1944. And that we are going to be shipped out and they just, they were not. I can understand it. They were jealous of us. And so we were there a few days. I don\u2122t know how long. I tell you what. I think it was the end of June and I think that we left a week later. Now I hav e literature from Hamburg.

So there was always a big doing on and they didn\u2122t do anything to us. Anyway they divided us. Part of us went to Hamburg and part of us went to Shtut thof [ph] . And they added some Hungarian girls but I don\u2122t know if ever anybody told you that. Before we left we were examined internally. Because perhaps we were hiding some gold or something. So and then we got brought to the train and when we were brought to the train and we saw that there were not only SS men but soldiers. But first of all it was a relief that we left, we were going out of Ausch witz because nobody in their right mind ever could fathom that that would happen. So they put us on the train and we were, again there was nowhere to sit you know. Just the train. But we stopped quite often because there were air raids because we drove, we didn\u2122t know where we were going. We drove through the whole of Germany from southern Poland we went all the way to Hamburg. So when we arrived at that place the next day and I do think it was my birthday. And it wasn\u2122t the 16 th or 17 th. I believe it was my birthday. And so we found out that we were in Hamburg. And they put us up in a warehouse. I found out just a few years ago that it used to be a tobacco warehouse. Right now I have a picture of it because I told you, I got in touch with Hamb urg and they sent me pictures. I have pictures of all the places we were. And there they write that we arrived between the 16 th and 17 th but I\u2122m quite sure we came there a little earlier. And it was clean. And the bunks were only two stories. Like one on upper and one lower Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 34 November 29, 2012 so that wasn\u2122t \u0152 before we had three stories. And they were smaller ones. Only about two together and we each had our own little bed, kind of. And the soup was better. And there was no gas chamber, you know. I mean we were in heaven. And but the first night the whole house started to shake and we didn\u2122t know what it was. It was an air raid. And some girls yelled to the others who were up there. Don\u2122t move. What are you moving. The whole thing shakes. We had no idea that the bombs are falling all around us. And so we started going to work. At first they put us on a shift and I mean we went to different places. Mostly oil companies, we were cleaning up. You know that\u2122s what we were doing first, to clean up. But I remember they brought me to this place and my first job was to wash windows and I have said to the fellow, could I have some newspaper and he said what do you need newspaper for? I said well to wash the windows you will see. And when I was finished they couldn\u2122t believe it, what a good job I did. And we got a little better soup. And there were other people working there but we found out later on were Dutch people and French people, not they weren\u2122t -- they were in work camps. And they were also working in these factories. To clean up after the air raids, but you know just to clean up. And the air raids were continuous. During the night and during the day like we would go in the morning and there were houses standing nicely and on the way back there was nothing. You could see the bathtub was hanging on and the stove was on the other hand hanging there. I mean they did a real good job I can tell you. And but the British knew and the Americans knew where we were. Tha t there were a group of women. They\u2122re not going to bomb us."

            "answer": "Where we stayed and even where we worked. And so we were there a few weeks. And I just found from Hamburg, I got this literature and it says let me tell you. We went to place called Niue Gra den and we arrived there on the 13 th of September and we left there on the 8 th of February. So we were there the whole winter. We went to work. People worked all over, but my group went to work in a sand pit because they built little houses because don\u2122t forget the people of Hamburg, they had nowhere to live . And so we were building little ho uses and so I was in a group where we\u2122re working in a sand pit. A nd so we each got a shovel and started shoveling the sand and we had a little train that you know little wagons and they put sand there. And we had a Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 35 November 29, 2012 foreman who was an old German, skinny gu y who was very decent. And he saw that I seemed to be a good worker. And it\u2122s funny when they see that you are a good worker, they always kind of find you a good job. So he stopped me and he said you are going to be the switcher. So I became the switcher on the train and you know there was a fellow who was the driver of the train and I was the switcher. And the driver, he was a communist and he had to go to the police, I believe every night or once a week so that he didn\u2122t run away or something like that. But the air raids were unbelievable and so when the air raids were, the thing was we had to watch out where the - it was called flak. That antiaircraft . You know it splinters, it splinters and if that caught you, you were dead. So when the train, when the se little wagons were empty we would turn them upside down. We could do that and we would hide under, yes and you could hear ping, ping, ping, you know how these things are falling on it. So we were there for a while until I told you til the second, ti l the eighth of February. And then they moved us again. Oh by the way, Niue Graden it\u2122s today a shopping center. And I had a friend. Her name was Ruth Pinchovsky and she, that name afterwards oh she married a fellow, Fayon and you know she was fighting with Hamburg that they shouldn\u2122t allow to put a shopping center there. But anyway, I have a picture of the shopping center, a part of the shopping center and there is a tablet where it says that we were there. That\u2122s what I read from. And anyway so they mo ved us to a place called Tiesstack on the eighth of February right."

            "question": "How do you spell that?",
            "answer": "Tiessta ck, T-I-E-S-S-T-A-C-K. And I was chosen to work right outside of camp. I was making big bricks with holes you know. Like I had a helper. She was mixing the cement with a stone and then I would put it in the form and bang it down and make it so solid and then you put out this form. You lift it out and you had th is brick. But you had to work hard otherwise it would fall apart. And then somebody came and they put it in the, it would be dried and they would make new houses. And it\u2122s a strange thing. I remember most everything but I could not tell you who was living with me in that room where I was. What it was like. They sent me from Hamburg a picture of that place. It doesn\u2122t say anything to me. I remember that there was a dining hall which was a long hall and I remember exactly where I was working. But I couldn\u2122t remember that place what it looked like or who was with me. Because very shortly after that one Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 36 November 29, 2012 day we went from work, which was around, I say you know that it was in, still in February but nobody wants to believe me. We went from work and we were standing to go in and as we we re standing the siren sounded and they told you that the flyers were already crossing the Channel and that was called a f ull alarm. And we told the guard who was a soldier and he was a nice guy. He was a decent guy. He was kind of heavy rotund and we calle d him puppy and we said puppy look, there\u2122s an air raid. Can\u2122t we go in. and he says you know I cannot let you go in because you have to be counted. And as we were standing there it became a f ull alarm. That meant the flyers really are already over the c ity and the bombs started to fall. And it killed puppy but of course he wasn\u2122t killed by the bomb but he was quite killed by the flak. The girl next to me, her name was Tuli Klasa , she was killed and I started running like crazy to the dining hall. And to this day nobody wants to own up whose plane it was. Do you know? They used to fly over us. It was in the spring of 45, when they were bombing Dresden to hell. So they were going over us every day. And because near us was a power station and this was like you know at that time radar didn\u2122t work so well. But this was a point they knew they had to fly over in order to go to the, on the way to Dresden. And, but the camp was gone and because the camp was gone, they had to move us. And they left us there a few days. There was like a factory and we were sleeping there on some benches or whatever it was. More outside. Because also luck was that we were the only ones who were in camp. The others, because it was early like must have been 4:30 so the girls still didn\u2122t come back from work. They worked outside of camp except we were near the camp. Yet nobody, only a few people was hurt and a few people was killed. Otherwise everybody would have been gone. And it was one plane which went in, got into trouble and had to let go. In order to save the plane and themselves they had to get rid of the bomb. And they fell on us. And I tried to find out about this plane. I wrote to a number of war museums in England and they don\u2122t know anything about it. I wrote to the war museum in Washington and there was such a clever guy who said sent me back an email. I should go to my home office. Like Montreal would be in the United States and I could go to the office. He had no idea what I was talking about. So til this day nobody wants to own up and I went to the war museum in Ottawa and I spoke to an officer and I said I\u2122d like to know what happened to th at plane because the camp was gone and because the camp was gone, we were moved to Bergen Belsen. And there half of the girls who would have survived died there of typhoid. So anyways after a few days we went to the train and as we were Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 37 November 29, 2012 waiting for the train there was an air raid. We were sitting there on the grass and we just didn\u2122t move. I mean we are not afraid of air raids. And we couldn\u2122t go anywhere because \u0152 and then the train came and they put us on the train and early in the morning we arrived. We didn\u2122t know where it was. And we had to carry some jackets or something. Air force, it was heavy like hell. And we schlepped it to this camp and then we arrived in the morning."

There were no bunks no nothing and we had to lie on the floor and it was terrible because one was lying on top of the other and when you had to go the bathroom you had to step one bathroom. The toilet didn\u2122t work and we had no water. We had no toilet. There was nothing. It was complete chaos there . I mean most of the people were dead. It was typhoid was \u0152"

As I told you, the toilets didn\u2122t -- I mean you couldn\u2122t even go. You know we went around the houses . It was terrible because \u0152 it was j ust awful. And then one day there was a huge tent. And we didn\u2122t know the tent was full of corpses. And they made us drag those corpses to a mass grave because they wanted you know, they knew that they had to, that they\u201are going to l ose so they wanted to clean it up kind of. So we did that and when, certain hours they said enough and so we just dropped the corpse and went back and you saw like a row of corpses lying there and you know you become so not feeling. You know you become so nothing. You know, you know that it\u2122s goes on, this is what you\u2122re going to be like and you fight on. And then the Germans ran away. And then they brought in Hungarian soldiers. And they didn\u2122t give us anything to eat either. So we went, tried to find some food and the Germans had storage. You know they stored potatoes and turnips and things like that under straw. Like earth and straw Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 38 November 29, 2012 and it was like, like big graves you know but a huge thing. So we went there to dig it up and these damned Hungarians they started shooting and they killed girls. And you know what, it\u2122s a funny thing. I\u2122m the only one who remembers that. When you will read anything about Tiesstack they don\u2122t talk that Hungarians were there, but they were there. Anyway and then they left. And then there was no one. There were just a few of us who still were able to walk around. And they were (sound skip) including myself and we felt that Red Cross must be coming. You know somebody must be coming so we want ed to prepare for that . We found a little table. Believe yo u me it was a little table. And it was hard for us to carry that little table. We carried it on the main road to the entrance of the camp. And as we were standing at the entrance somebody started shooting at us and the girl next to me was shot at but the b ullet went into \u0152 she had a blouse with a, with a pad and it went into the pad, but nothing happened to her and as we were standing there a huge tank arrived with a white star. Who the hell knew what it was? You know we have no idea what it was. And then the turret opened and there was this young man and he said that the division of all the allies came to liberate us. He said it in German. Atdalem Aleit Mezhde [Ge rman expression \u0152 ph] he said and they started driving in and the soldiers came walking. And I spoke a little English already at that time. And he told, the first thing he told me is that Roosevelt died. Because Roosevelt died on the 12 th and we were liberated on the 15 th. And I like an idiot was crying. I never cried throughout my whole three years but I cried. So now when I give a lecture, I tell the children that I am ashamed of my tears because Mr. Roosevelt could have saved thousands of Jews and he didn\u2122t do anything so that\u2122s why I\u2122m ashamed of my tears. Anyway so this British army came in. This was the first camp they liberated and they saw the horror because most people were dead and there were thousands of them. And they got in touch with their head office and the first thin g they did, they put up showers. So at least we could get washed. And there was a town not far from where we were. It was called Bergen, which was an armory town. Of course the German soldiers were not there anymore and that they changed into a hospital town. And they tried to take us all the sick people first so I was, you know I wasn\u2122t sick. I was walking around. So you should have seen. They put down on the ground, the soldiers put down a stretcher. Before you knew there were ten naked ladies lying th ere because you were not allowed to take any of their clothes because it was full of lice. Right. Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 39 November 29, 2012 Anyway so I was one of the last ones going out. And we\u2122re coming to Bergen and there was a square and I was put up with some other girls in one of these buil dings. And there was a kitchen and I don\u2122t know how smart I got, said I\u2122m going to go and work in the kitchen. So I worked in the kitchen. And I stole some butter and I put it in my chest and I ran home because I wanted to bring it to the girls butter. And before I came it was running down. Anyway, so then the Red Cross started coming and they had clothes for us because after all we had nothing and I got a leather jacket. It was an old leather jacket, but it was a leather jacket. I got Eisenhower jacket. Yes, oh yes, but my director on our own before we were liberated, there was nobody, we couldn\u2122t walk around and there were warehouses. You have no idea what the Germans had warehouses full of what do you call it, attach\u00e9 cases. You know these leather attac h\u00e9 cases that officers always used and you see films, they always had these attach\u00e9 . A whole building full of attach\u00e9 cases. A whole building full of jackets, flyers. You know for the air force. Beautiful jackets. And then there was old clothes and all kinds of junk. And I found myself a pair of pants. It was they were huge. So I put a, I think some kind of a just string around it because I weighed 46 pounds at that time."

And there was a movie house and you only were allowed to go to a movie if you had an escort. And you had to go with a soldier. And I found myself a soldier and his name was Goldberg and he says he was Jewish and that he came from Edinburgh, Liverpool, I don\u2122t remember what. Somewhere. And he became my friend, kind of. And they said when they said if we know of any people you want to write to, you could. So I raised my hand and they said you want to write to someo ne. I said yes. I have an uncle in Canada and they said but do you know his address. I said Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 40 November 29, 2012 damn well I know the address. And that is, 12, it\u2122s 1448 Bishop Street Montreal. And they looked like I was nuts. You know how could I remember an address in Cana da. So I did write him a le tter and my uncle got it.

And we were so happy to be alive that we just went into the houses. We looked around and we didn\u2122t steal anything. It was amazing that it didn\u2122t occur to us that we would take anything. And this is what I tell the young people that here we were and who, they did such terrible things and we went into the villages and we didn\u2122t do anything to anybody. We didn\u2122t steal. We didn\u2122t burn down the houses. We just looked in awe to all these things. And then I remember we had a big party on the square and we were kind of dancing and so on. Anyway, there was a girl whom I knew already from my Zionist days and she said that her h, she got in touch with her husband and he\u2122s coming. And she w ill go home with him. And so I said to her, Eva, can I go with you. She said sure. So I went with her. And then Ruth Bondy, you might know the n ame. She\u2122s a writer. She lives in Israel. She went with us on that. So we went on that rickety track and we drove through whole of Germany. Hamburg all the way to the Czech border. That\u2122s a long way. And we came there and we went into the inn and they didn\u2122t know what to do with us. They were so happy for us. And the next day we drove to the Czech border. We got off the truck and we stood there and we sang the Czech national anthem. And then we drove into Prague. And this young man with whom I\u2122m still friends he said ok girls. This is Slatege [ph], and this girl who was my friend, I called her Chinda. I didn\u2122t know her. Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 42 November 29, 2012 Orkin was her name but we call her Chinda. And the two of us, we looked at each other and we said so where we are going.

I got my apartment back. I even find my husband. You can come to us. So she and she l eft an d she gave me the address. And she left and I knew exactly where it was. And so the two of us you know we traveled very light. We didn\u2122t have a penny to our names. We did have a few clothes you know. Not much but a little something. And we went on the street car and we had no money so a soldier paid for us and that\u2122s how I started my life again."

He was a very good boy and he said and again I have to emphasize that all what we needed to know, we had to memorize and so he gave me his mother\u2122s name because his father went illegally to Palestine. In 1940. And gave me his mother\u2122s name and her address. And so when I came to Prague and first of all we had to, to go to eat we went to habitat. You know a Catholic charity. And to the nuns we went. The nuns fed us lunch. We were lined up. There were people from all over the place. And I came with my leather jacket and next to me there were two young men and they said would you like to barter it for a coat and I said yeah sure, if you have a nice coat. So they said ok tomorrow for lunch, you come and we bring you the coat. So they came and I gave them my jacket and they gave me the coa t. And so I started looking for this lady and when I came to the address, the super told me that they moved and he gave me the address but there was a building in the center of Prague where all the people like me would gather. And they would tell us, give us information where we could get a little money and how we could get food and so on. And in the foyer there were pictures and they Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 43 November 29, 2012 said this is my brother. He was there. This is my mother. She was there . And amongst the pictures I found the picture of this young man, my friend. I knew already that he is not back yet. And so I went to his family and I told them who I was and they were very kind to me. And the gentleman already knew that he was not alive, but the mother still didn\u2122t know. She still was waiting for him. He died in Buchenwald in January 45. And so if they would ask me to come for meals and I would go there for meals and then they realized that he\u2122s not coming back so and I said I don\u2122t hav e anybody and I told them that I have an uncle in Canada, that I want to go to Canada. I won\u2122t stay. And so they took me in. And I lived with them and the gentleman was very practical and he said to me, since you want to go to Canada you better go and start learning English so I was, since I had somewhere to stay. It didn\u2122t cost me anything and I went to, it was called the Institute for modern languages. And I went every day and by the end of the year the, like you know winter, in the fall and the spring. I wrote my university exam and then I looked for a job. And he thought that he would open a little store for me like a flower shop. Is that he would finance it and I would be running it. And nothing came of it. And then he had a friend who opened a store and they hired me. You know what I had for sale? Three bales of clothes. That was my inventory and one day I came and somebody broke in. So that was the end of my job. And I went to the Jewish community and I got a job which was a horrible job. Back in the place where I was once, where I lived it was above the synagogue. There was a big hall and there were clothes brought back from Terezin which was a horrible thing. And we went through them and put them like the better ones aside and so with people like me could get some clothes. And also we had the divisions from America. People from America sent, were sending parcels and so we had there and there were blankets. They were not wool blankets but there are blankets. And you know what, we s tole them, a lot of them. And I had from one of the blankets made a coat. It was, it\u2122s made of blankets. It was a brown and I had a beautiful brown winter coat. And I didn\u2122t stay there too long. And I was hired to work in the, we had a newspaper which is now Iresh Chodesh. At that time it was called the Biesnik [ph]. And I was working there with a lady. We did the addresses you know. We had little plates and we put the addresses on and I also was \u0152 would retype the articles people wrote by hand and I would type them so the proofreader had an easier time to do that. Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 44 November 29, 2012 But what happened was my mother\u2122s cousin whom I called uncle was brought back from Israel and he became chief rabbi of Prague. And his name was Gustav Sicher so you know I was kind of a high ranking (both tal king) there. And one day I went downstairs and I met a man and the man knew that I knew English and he said listen I have a good job for you. Would you like to work for this American Joint. I said well, why not? So he sent me there. I had to go and I worked from the American Joint and my salary was twice what I had and I didn\u2122t have much work. I filled out little pieces of paper and I went to the bank to get thousands of dollars because in order to emigrate, you had to pay in dollars. Now we provided the people with dollars. And so I waited til \u0160 yes, and my visa didn\u2122t come through. It took you know four years. And they were looking for girls in Australia . There was a shortage of young girls. So I had a relative who was working in immigration for the Jewish community. And she says you know what. Why don\u2122t you make out an application for a visa for you? You know you\u2122re not getting the visa to Canada so you might as well try to go to Australia . And one day I got the visa for Australia and the next day I got the visa for Canada. So I didn\u2122t go to Australia. That\u2122s too far away."

And I phone him and he cries. He doesn\u2122t stop crying. He says you know what. When I was young I did all these things and now this, it doesn\u2122t leave me and I\u2122m just a wreck. And so it comes back more than before. It haunts us much more. And this is the bad part. And you see, a person like you can understand it. But how could you tell that to your neighbor. You know how would they know what you feel like. So you are there and you just, you have to keep on fighting. And hoping that you are not going to die by yourself. That\u2122s all I\u2122m worried about. I have a lifeline s o but the thing is that I still try to, as a matter of fact, now I\u2122m doing research on Mrs. Albright. Mrs. Albright lies. You know that I met her cousin. Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 55 November 29, 2012"

            "question": "You did?",
            "answer": "Yes, I met her cousin in, Dasha , I met her cousin in 1998 I believe because this frie nd of mine whom I told you. He was in Prague at the same time and he was standing in a hotel and I phoned him and he says come on over. I have a visitor here. Come on over. So I went to the hotel and her cousin Dasha was there and we talked, you know but nothing much. You know like visiting in a hotel. You talk about the city or whatever it was. Because he comes from the same town as Dasha, and he knew her as a young girl and her parents . Her father was their family doctor. And so he says I have to go now. He says I have to go now too \u0152 and so s he left and we went downstairs and we crossed the Mensa square and I said to her, tell me, how can she say that she didn\u2122t know she was Jewish. So she said to me, my mother, her daughter said, mommy when she looks in the mirror, doesn\u2122t she see who she is? You know. I tell you. I cannot understand it. She came back to Prague in 1947. That means she was ten years old. Her cousin Dasha who was older came back at the same time from England and her cousin Dasha, her parents weren\u2122t there. They were all killed. And her grandparents. Didn\u2122t she ask what happened to uncle so and so? I mean even you are ten years old. You know the bad person is her father. I hate him because he was such a bureaucrat. He didn\u2122t want that anything should interfere with his climb. He wanted to become ambassador. You know being a Jew he was afraid. Maybe they wouldn\u2122t promote him you know. So they all became, they all were baptized in England. I mean she\u2122s such a smart woman. Not only that, she was teaching history so didn\u2122t she teach history what was going on in Europe. Didn\u2122t she know? I mean how could, if I would meet her I would say Mrs. Albright you are such a smart person but you are such a damn liar. Anyway what I am doing now research on, in her books, if you seem to have the book, on page 276 there is an article, by (sound skip) by the name of Eugena Smo lkova that she was in Auschwitz and she was pulled out by an SS man and that\u2122s how she survived. You know went to Hamburg. This is a bloody lie. Because we were not, we were not in the showers, we were selected in the camp. And when she arrived she went to Niue Graden which is a lie too because we went from Auschwitz, we went first to Hamburg, Freihaven, and then we went to Niue Graden. So the whole thing doesn\u2122t make sense. And not only that, you know I have the book where everybody is listed who went to camps, to, from Terezin right?

            "answer": "I cannot find her. They cannot find her in beit Terezin so we don\u2122t know who she is. She writes there that no, that she, her daughter is working for a Mrs. Albright. So I told your friend Michaela, I said why don\u2122t you ask this daughter which transport she went to Auschwitz. Because we cannot find her. Her name is Eugena Smolkova . We cannot find her anywhere. So this is my latest thing and I want to write to the publisher. And I don\u2122t want to say they should change it now, but in case there\u2122s a reprint. Either you leave the whole thing out or say the truth how it is, because Eugena Smolkova can\u2122t be found to go to Auschwitz."
