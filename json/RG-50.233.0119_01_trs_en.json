It took a second, the other one was stretched out. So then he said th at he approved he\u2122s the strongest. And then he was with me in the woods after a year and we escaped from the camp. But in the end he died of a heart attack, actually he had cancer in his mout h and then they gave him so much cortisone that, awful big dose, that he went for a visit to Israel and while he was on the visit to Israel he died and the dead was a heart attack, but this was caused by the cortisone.

It was arranged by the Judenrat, by the Jewish Council for the Germans to come and grab people from the streets, th eir houses, so it was arranged how many was in the work force from the ghetto, so everybody got a card that this and this day he has to report to work. They worked, they sent them out, since he became 12, he worked, came out two or three times a week to go to work, in the winter mostly by snow a nd the summer on the roads and other things. And we lived together because in the ghetto we moved in the apartment where Leibush lived; so happens that this apartment was in the place where the part of the ghetto was at. And we got the room and we worked together, we lived togeth er. He wasn\u2122t, it wasn\u2122t so bad because my brother he was a member of the Judenrat, th e first Judenrat and he was selected by the ________ about which we will talk later and then later he was arrested but, in the book it\u2122s written how he was released because only three Je ws were released from jail, the rest were killed, the whole Judenrat. Leibush\u2122s father is still in the ghetto, he had his store because this was the place that he was not thrown out. So, how much he could buy and market things and this way he was not bad off in the ghetto. They had enough, everything.

Now, if we wouldn\u2122t live from him there would be other people, but this way when we took it over, so nobody else came in the house. But the main thing is from Shu lim, also here you have written down 1945, Shulim was born the same year as Richard, my older br other\u2122s son, but Richard was born in America. My brother had moved there afte r a pogrom in our town in 1919. I always think of these two, Richard now a doctor in America, Shulim killed in Poland at 13, not 13 but 12. See the people are so stupid, they know by he was born in 1930 and he was killed in 1942, but here they mark down 13. So he was born when he was 12 years old. So this, I think, this is a very nice sentence, that to compare those two, Richard no w a doctor in America and Shulim killed in Poland at the age of twelve. So, what you can write too much, but I think what you have is enough material."

They organized a committee in ev ery little town to help the German Jews who were thrown out and we organized in Kolbuszowa also and this is the first time he took part for it. And I remember the first time that he attend ed shul when he spoke about giving money to this organization to help. The second time I remember he came to shul to speak that when before the war started and the Polish government saw that there have to be a war, so they wanted the citizens should donate money to b uy airplanes because the Polish air force didn\u2122t have too many airplanes; they had a few. So, they collected money so I remember he, this is the second time he came to shul, he spoke to the Jews , naturally he spoke Polish. Spoke to the Jews willing to give money, and I remember his wo rds, he said, \ufb01Today we beg you to give the money, but in a few months, I am afraid they will take it without.\ufb02 He meant the Germans, they would take it without begging you, without asking you. He asked the people for money, and then this was the first two times, when the war started he was drafted as a reservist, as a doctor to the army. He was taken to a prisoners\u2122 camp in an officers\u2122 prisoner of war camp.

When the Germans ordered the Jews should make a Judenrat , that means a Jewish council, and there was one Jew who right away volunteered. As the Germ ans came in he started to be an important man by the Germans, he started to come to the co mmandant and he started to tell them all kinds of stories. He was not a very person, this\u2013.. he started to tell them which Jews have hidden merchandise, as a matter of fact my father suffered very much from this Jew. Like he came to my -- the Germans liked ________ coffee, coffee beans. He came to my -- and we had coffee beans hidden so he came every day for coffee bean s. Today he wanted two kilo, the next day three kilo and then four kilo\u2013.and then my father told hi m how much can I give you, I mean we don\u2122t have new shipments. He said to him a we ll, if you take so much water out it will be dry. So he said well if you don\u2122t want to give mo re I will take it, so he went to the Germans and he squealed that my father has hidden me rchandise.

They took away everything, we ha d a lot of merchandise be cause this merchandise could be sold and we could have money, but th ey took away everything. My father ran away, and then because he was afraid that they will arre st him, I run away and this time I run away to Russia, which later I came back. And he, and th is man wanted to become the president because the Germans said you have to orga nize a Jewish council, but the Jews knew if he would become council, it would be very bad for the Jews because he was, like I said. Before the war everybody knew somebody wanted to have a witness in court, if there was a court case and they needed a witness, he would always be a witness fo r money, naturally. So even there was here in America there are sayings if I speak to some people from Kolbuszowa and I ask them something and they don\u2122t want to tell me a lie, so they said, what do you think, I am this and this? I don\u2122t want to mention his name because he has his family. So they say, what do you think I am him? He was known that he is \u0152 for money he can be a witness. So then we Jews knew that if he would become the president it would be bad for Jews because he would collaborate with the Germans. So the Jews st arted to speak to prominent Polish Catholics, especially to the mayor, who we told him that we are very concerned that he would become the president, not only this, because if he will be president he will pick out members, his friends, his like, and then it will be bad. We the Jews, I say we, I say the Jews themselves, say the only one who could actually be stronger than him is Dr. Anderman, he didn\u2122t look Jewish, I mean he didn\u2122t have a beard, most of the Jews had bear ds and he spoke beautiful German because he started in Vienna and he was a pr oud man and he would never -- he would be able to protect the Jews. A group of Jewish people went to him and they said to him he should become__________ so he said, I was never involved with Jewish things, I am a doctor. I don\u2122t want to be a politician, and I don\u2122t want to have a job like this. The Jews begged him, they told him, look if you don\u2122t do it, you are the only one, can protect us from this man and he knew that this man is no good for the Jews. Well, anyway, after a few times. I remember my father went to him and others, he said all right, I will do it against my judgment, I will do it, only on one condition. If I will -- he had to pick out ten or tw elve members of the council, -- only if I can pick out the people I want. So, he made the list and he picked out mostly younger people, mostly people without beards, and that shouldn\u2122t be, again, the Germans shouldn\u2122t dislike them and also, people who were in the Jewish community leaders before the war. They were people, respected citizens, and people who were quite well off and he pi cked out this Jewish council which included my brother Leibush, and my brother-in-law Sh_____, well younger people. He organized the Jewish council whic h was a blessing for Kolbuszowa because before the Germans used to grab people from the streets from thei r houses for work. He organized and made lists, and everything that had to be done was done th rough the organization. If you want more details, in the book I have more details about Anderman."

            "answer": "No, no only Jews. No Poles, th ey had their doctors there, he wasn\u2122t allowed to treat Poles; the Germans forbid a Jewish doctor to treat Poles. Then also he gave me a job, before the war I was the buyer for my father\u2122s store and I used to go to different towns. They needed somebody to bring in the flour and other food what Germans gave on carts to the Jews, and this had to be, we had to bring it from Jeshup, from other towns. Also we had to buy a lot of stuff from the black market, like potatoes, they didn\u2122t give us enough, other things that we needed we opened a public kitchen, a soup kitchen in -- he organi zed a soup kitchen. The kitchen needed certain things that the Germans didn\u2122t give us, so I -- th ey picked me up and I went out twice a week to different towns. I got a pass and I could go ou t and I could travel, and I brought in all those things that the Jewish community got officially from the Germans. By going out and having this pass, I also could buy a lot of black market fo r the Jewish -- for the soup kitchen we needed, and also I bought on the black market for myself , for my family. I brought in stuff and they sold it so they could make something out of it, my father. So this was how we worked with Anderman and I became very, very friendly with Anderman and I admired him because he was very fair. There was something, a question about having privileges, the people who were in the Jewish council, they wanted to take advantage, he always was against it. Again in his book, you have the stories about it. Then they organized the ghetto, they organized the ghetto so he was responsible for the Jewish should have where to live. He built a house a year before the war, and this was the most exclusive, the most beau tiful house in Kolbuszowa very ---. It was a modern house, this was the only house what had electricity and was the only house who had indoor plumbing. You see, he had a, not compre ssor, what you call it, to make electricity."

It was a beautiful house, it had nice furniture, so this _________ the head of the county, the German who was very vicious, his name was Twardon. And Twardon wanted to take over his house for himself because it was in a nice section. So he urged Anderman to take over an apartment in the ghetto, in the place where the ghetto is. He said to him, you take, because you are the head of the Judenrat, pick out the best apartment for yourself. Anderman said I will not pick out an apartment until the last Jew has a roof over his head. And if the Jews will be settled, then I will take it. See, he wanted to move in his apartment, then later said to him, I want to move in the apartment but he wanted a Jews should give him 10,000 zloty to renovate the apartment. He said renovate it, it\u2122s just a new house, it\u2122s just a year old. And besides, why do you have to renovate, you wouldn\u2122 t live long in this house, the war will end and I will go back to the house. See, he didn\u2122t lik e these answers."

Besides the Judenrat he also arrested about ten more people, and naturally for the town it was a very big shock they arrested, but Anderman was free. Everybody said Anderman he\u2122s the father of us and he will try to go out and try to see that they should be released. He went and spoke to this Twardon so tw o days later, or a day later he was arrested. Once he was arrested we felt th at the situation was very grave because he was the only one who could --. They were in jail in Kolbuszowa about two weeks."

So, he -- now my brother was arrested, my brother-in-law wasn\u2122t arrested, because my brother-in-law, I\u2122m writing also in the book, there was before the ghetto was established they took a certain amount of Jews from the market place and they sent them away to have less Jews by us. He wasn\u2122t there, so they didn\u2122t arrest him. Later though he came back, we paid money, he came back, so there was no Judenrat. Now we were alone so naturally the police started to come in and the police started to make orders but then he said he\u2122s looking for a new head of the Judenrat. While they were sitting in jail, they were also sitting two brothers, their name was Rappaport, Yanchi Rappaport and Pashi Rappaport and they were Jews without beards, they were young, they were educated Jews. They had their business before the war that they used to send pigs to Katervitz it\u2122s a big town near the German border, this was th eir business, so Anderman said\u2013."

            "question": "Pigs they sent?",
            "answer": "Yeah, this was their business. They bought pigs, they sent them out, they slaughtered them, they sent the meat to this town and they had this business. It was a very unusual business for Jews but they were not observant Jews, so this is what they did. Anderman knew -- we knew that Twardon\u2122s looking for a new ________ but he wants to have someone with authority, so even in jail, because in jail they lived in one big basement, it was not li ke a regular jail, but they kept them in the basement from the magistrate build ing. So Anderman said that if he would ask somebody to become________ the president of Judenr at everybody should refuse. This way if everyone would refuse and to say that they cannot take care on this only Anderman can. This maybe will force them to let out Anderman. Me anwhile this Rappaport who was there he didn\u2122t listen to him and he told his wife to go to Tw ardon and tell him that he r husband, this Pashik Rappaport is willing to become Judenrat. That he\u2122s young, he\u2122s energetic, he\u2122s good looking and the German would like him, and he speak s good German and they have a business in K________. He looked at her, she was a good looki ng woman and one day the police came and they took out this Pashik and they saw that he --. They take him away to the office where the ____ so right away Jews started to suspect but he said oh nobody will become the ald____. Anyway he spoke to Twardon and he told Twar don he would be a good Judenrat man and he will serve the Germans and all these things and he released him and his brother from jail, and he made the president and his brothe r the assistant. Once this happened, Anderman said now we have lost everything. We didn\u2122t believe that a Je w would do it but he did and this man started to pick out members of the Judenrat. Naturally he picked out differen t kinds of people that Anderman wanted. Anderman wanted the best qua lity and he picked out from the people that they were servant. He was in the cattle business so he took a few people who were in the cattle business and a few black marketers. He made a new Judenrat. Now the new Judenrat started to work and then the Polish population wanted to take away Anderman. Anderman could go out because, as a matter of fact, pract ically every night he went out to sleep in some Polish house. This was watched, this jail wa s watched by the municipal police. They knew him so they let him out and the next day before dawn he came back. The Polish people begged him not to go back. Eventually they would do something with t hose people, they will not keep them forever. He didn\u2122t listen; he said that the Jews cannot take care. I am the one who can speak to the Germans for them; they listen to me. He didn\u2122t run away and then one day they came and they took all of them away to J______. They let out only three Je ws, they let out, my brother included. If you read the book you will know the reason why. My brother-in-law came back from J____ so Twardon said that there are some me mbers of the first Judenrat, they should take them in. They became in the second Judenrat. They were in J____ about two weeks. After two weeks they took all of them to Auschwitz and this time Auschwitz was not so prominent as later. They took them to Auschwitz and as th ey took them to Auschwitz, the families start to receive telegrams. They said this one died from cancer, this one died on pneumonia, this one died trying to escape. Let me flip the tape. END OF SIDE A, TAPE 1"

            "answer": "Must be -- because I bought one, it\u2122s not very good. All right so there came the telegrams and always the telegrams had something to say. Th ey had to sign, somebod y died, let\u2122s say on lung cancer. Why they had to sign that he suffered from lung cancer a long time. Why they did it, why they make so evident a ------; somebody died on some other sic kness, that he suffered from it. Then a week after they r eceived the telegrams and you coul d see the postman came in went into a house, that right away you could hear the crying and the screaming so we knew that he comes with a telegram. About two weeks later, the same people received bills from Auschwitz with bills to pay for the cremati on with some ashes. They had to pay for the cremation. This is how Anderman was gone. Meanwhile when he wa s arrested, his wife and son were left in Kolbuszowa with non-Jewish friends. They we nt to Warsaw and they lived this Aryan as Catholics in Warsaw. His wife survived but the son was an officer in the Polish underground when it was the Warsaw uprising. Not the Wars aw uprising but the Jews of the general Warsaw uprising, he was killed in the uprising. His wife survived and after a while she came over here an old broken woman. She died here in America. For Anderman, when he was arrested so the Polish people, even the mayor who was in _____ went to V_______ and told them he should be released if he says the Polish patriot and he is such an honest man. He says this is why we arrested him, he was too honest. I think that this Anderman that wh at he did for the Jews that he never, never associated with the Jews, that he wa s an exceptional man. I always say if the Jews would ever have saints like the Catholics have saints, Anderman should have been a saint. Because he could have survived, he had a possibility; he had help from the Polish people, he was considered to be a Polish Catholic. He said ,No, I cannot do it, I have to stay with the Jews because the Germans listen to me and they respect me."

Now his photos from Auschwitz, now usually the Germans didn\u2122t make mug shots from prisoners. They had millions and millions, I don\u2122t know what they did,______. Now the people who were selected to be, to go the gas chambers. As you know, about 85% right away went to the gas ch ambers; about 15% they went to the camp. So the people who went to the gas chambers didn\u2122t get the tattoos. Only the people who went to the right or to the left like they had the selection. But very few, Anderman naturally was not -- all the Kolbuszowa were not gassed right away. This time, there were no transports to Auschwitz. This was a camp where they took mostly Polish people were in the underground or were in the black market. Jews who were called for one reason or another, like the Judenrat. So they didn\u2122t have selections; they were in the camp, some a week, some, some were tw o weeks. Because he was doctor, and because he was an important person, they made him mug shots. This is the first time I saw that somebody got out. The mug shots th at I got out about ten years later, about ten years from Anderman. They kept Anderman, fo r this I have the number and the triangles because they have two kinds of triangles. Jews have always had triangles, if he was a criminal or political, the Jews usually had two. They ha d political and Jews so the triangle made like a myogen David. So one was a red one which was a certain other transgressions and the other one was the yellow, the yellow was for Jews. So I got later from Auschwitz."

We used to come to one place every week with packages for them because there was one of the guards that he could be bribed. We gave him money and he took the packages with letters for them. If they arrived, I don\u2122t know. Because I had a pass to go out from the ghetto, I told you I went two, three times to buy, to bri ng the stuff, so I was the one who brought over the packages. We met in one place and there I met people from all other towns from around us. Everybody did the same thing. They brought th e packages and later this German, somebody came.

He could take the money, take the food -- but so long as there was hope, everybody sent them. I think once they came in, that they brought back letters. He was there about ten days or two weeks.

But one, an exceptional game , which I want you should put it in, which this is very important. The Henoch, he was like the ringlead er, was very smart for his age. When he lived before we went to the ghetto, we lived not far from the German police. We knew the German commandants of the police. Everybody knew them. One was good, one was bad, one was worse. There was one man, his names was Hare nbeer. Habier is H-a-bi-e-r. He had a face like very, very like a bulldog. His face was not r eally a human face and he was very vicious. He killed a lot of people. The children knew about it and their game in ghetto was that this Henoch and Blimcia took together a few other ch ildren. Henoch stood in front of them and he spoke to them German because he heard about it. He used to ask them, he had in his hand a piece of wood pretending this is a rifle."

He took th e rifle and started to pretend, poof, poof, one after the other. After he pointed the rifle, he said poof, they fell down, pretending they are dead. This was their game. It shows you that the time the children of three and three and a half years had those games. Ev ery time. the same game, got together, he was the policeman. Yeah, also when he said, first introduced himself wh en he got the job. He said, Ich ben Habier, he didn\u2122t know the Habier. He said he heard it so he said I am Habier.

Every time I cam e, there was not a time that I shouldn\u2122t bring something special for them. If it was candy, fru it about the first cherries, the first apples, the first pears -- every time if I could only buy a few, it was for them. It was also, that we always laughed, that they knew that I am away in anothe r town and I have to come back. Usually I came back on a bicycle; they always used to wa it. By Jews there is a saying when you mention Sabbath, you always say Shabot Kordish. It means the Holy Sabbath. She heard the Shabot Kordish, there was another expression that when children came to their grandparents or to their aunt, every Saturday they came for Sabbath fruit. They gave them a treat. They used to come in and they used to say Shabbos Optz. Optz means in Jewish, fruit. They used to give to ess Shabbos Optz to get something. When they waited for me to bring something, somebody mentioned oh you waiting for him because he\u2122s going to bring you Shabbos Optz. This girl she remembered something but she didn\u2122t remember ex actly so when I came in, so she came to me and she said if I brought her Shabbos Kordish. It means the Ho ly Sabbath because she didn\u2122t remember the expression. Since then she knew every time I came so both of them wait and they say give me the Shabbos Kordish, it means the Sabbath fruit, the Holy Sabbath. But everything for us, we had something. Naturally th ey were the first one because we were a very close family and the children from my sisters, were our children, were the same thing. It didn\u2122t make a difference who the mother was, her mother, his mother loved us as much as her, and her mother loved her --so it\u2122s always the same. If my mother in th e ghetto, if she had something, if I brought her something special or something, they we re the first one to have it. I remember we once received a package from Turkey. In th e package was a salami, a Swiss cheese and a package of chocolate. All kinds of goodies that we didn\u2122t have it in ghetto. My mother, naturally took it, it was somethi ng, she divided it in small pieces and they were the first ones to get it. Later when I came to America so I asked my brother, we got once in ghetto a package from Turkey, did you send it? He said I didn\u2122t se nd it but there was once an ad in the paper that said when you pay in fifteen dollars, a Turkey company will send to any place in German occupied Europe, a package. So he went, he sent in $15."

A box of margar ine, a box of crackers, a box of tea, coffee. Then I asked him how many packages did you send in? He said once. I asked why once, we got it. He said why didn\u2122t you send it every day. Yes, he could afford it. Every day, send in $15. He said well I didn\u2122t get a receipt that you received it. I said, how could you get a receipt? We were in the ghetto. But to take a chance, ma ybe 99% it will get lost but 1% it will come in, why not? So -- it was late. I remember when we got those goodies, my mother divided and every day they came and they got the piece of cheese , they got a piece of salami. We were very, very, very close and naturally the children were everything. For this reason, now I have grandchildren their age. I look at the grandchildren and I see those children and how those children were undressed. Th e mother had to take them in to a gas chamber. They had to be killed being two and three and a half years old. The mind cannot absorb it. We cannot talk about it because there are no words to talk about it a million and a half children. Those were such beautiful, beautiful children. They didn\u2122t ask nothing from the world, they only wanted to be alive. Naturally they didn\u2122t realize what\u2122s going on. This is how they went. I think that f you will write about them, you\u2122ll put them both together not separate because they were -- they lived together -- they were the same age, they lived in the same house. Everything I remember when they came to our house in the ghetto, they always came together. They were beautiful, they were nice dressed and --."
