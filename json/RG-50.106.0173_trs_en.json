He then helped to bring the rest of his family. He and my grandmother Mirel, M-i-r-e-I had seven children. My father was the sixth child of that family. And my father\u2019s name is Simche, S-i-m-c-h-e Weber. They changed his name also to Lakritz. He was also known as Simon Weber, or Simon Lakritz. My mother\u2019s name is Marjem, M-a-r-j-e-m, also known as Mary, in the United States. She was Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Lakritz \u00b0 April 3, 2008 born Fass, F-a-s-s. She a-and my father were both born in Galicia. They both immigrated to Germany and a-arrived and lived in different city, my father in Kiel, my mother in Cologne. I was the first of three children born of my parents. I was born, as I said, on June 1, 1934 in Kiel. After th -- me was my sister Rosa, R-o-s-a Weber, and her name also was subsequently changed to Lakritz. She was born on July 28, 1935 in Kiel, and she died I think the first or second day of her -- her first day of her life. She is the only member of the family who 1s buried in Kiel, who has in fact a burial place, other than my mother in the United States. My brother then followed and he was born on September the second 1936 and he was born also in the city of Kiel. That is the extent of my immediate family. I will go into the extended family when I\u2019m asked."

            "question": "Okay. Tell me a little bit about your parents. What did your father do, what kind of work did he do?",
            "answer": "My father worked for his father. My grandfather, Artur, otherwise known as Arthur Weber, had established a business in the city of Kiel. From what I understand -- I don\u2019t really know the whole nature of it but at -- at -- after the f -- end of the first World War, when he arrived -- whenever he arrived in -- in Kiel, I\u2019m not sure when, he established a -- a wholesale business, and I believe initially it was of material after the war. In any event, he then changed that business to basically a Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Lakritz , April 3, 2008 business of collecting during the -- th-the beginning of the Nazi regime, of collecting items that the German economy needed; raw material, reusable material. And so he became a wholesaler of schmatter and of all types of metal and all kinds o-of things that they could recycle. And he, during the time when Jews couldn\u2019t find employment, he employed many, many Jews of Kiel in this business, and they would go through the streets of Kiel with a handcart and call out something. And I\u2019m -- I\u2019m relating basically what I -- what I understand. And these people would buy the used material that was recyclable, that Germany needed and then they would sell it to my grandfather, my grandfather was their employer and I guess he was the contributor to the livelihood of many, many Jews who also came from Galicia and -- like he had. And they formed a community in Kiel, which is important to understand, I mean the history of my family, which is recorded in Kiel and in books and in theses. His relationship to the other Jews, and to his own kind of Jews who immigrated to Germany is important. He was a very devout Jew. A Hassidic Jew, and -- as I think most of them were when they moved to Galicia, from Galicia to Germany. And he was a member of the one synagogue in -- in -- in -- in Kiel. And as a devoted and daily religious man such as my father was also, he belonged to that synagogue. But the Jews of Germany who were integrated Jews, and my gr-grandfather kind of Jews, clashed. And they clashed culturally, they Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Lakritz : April 3, 2008 clashed religiously in their dress, in their manner, in their form of employment, economically, in -- in -- in all the other way. So those two groups in Kiel, separated. And my grandfather, having a compound property an-and -- and a -- and a big warehouse, and it was a big business, anyway, he created his own synagogue, and I take pride in the father -- in the fact that my grandfather, whenever I\u2019ve told that story, 1s the only person that I know who had his own synagogue and his own congregation. And that synagogue, and the photograph of his synagogue 1s reproduced in the books -- in the history books, published by the state where I was born and by the city of Kiel, and I was given the books, an-and -- and the photograph of that particular synagogue is repeated over and over, even in the museum of -- of Kiel and -- which is outside the -- Kiel. And it is a example, I suppose of that there were Jews, and that there was an existence. Anyway, tha -- I want to lead up to why this is significant in my family, because I come from these people. They are ordinary people, they are very religious people, they are very good people. They are very honest people, hardworking people, family people, loving people. And all of these people were killed during the Holocaust. Thirty-one members of my father immediate -- im-immediate I\u2019m -- I\u2019m speaking now, members of my father\u2019s family were killed in the co -- various concentration camps of the Nazis. All of that is verified by documents that I have collected. And I\u2019m Interview with Alfred Lakritz \u00b0 April 3, 2008 talking now of my paternal grandfather, my paternal grandmother, all seven of their children, all seven, if any ha -- were married, and all of them but one were married -- all of them had children and of all of those children in the -- in this compilation that I made of the records of my family, I have the whole family tree. I have all of their names and birthdates and places of where they were killed, and all those children but- seven of those children, survived. Seven children of this large family survived the war. And one of the survivor had been interned in Auschwitz. He -- he is the only one who survived the concentration camp of -- of all of my immediate cousins. All of my cousins otherwise, but the other -- my brother and I and I think four, survived. And the survival of these other cousins is interesting. Two or three of them went from Kiel o-or Cologne, or wherever they were living, right now I don\u2019t recall, and they went on the Kindertransport to England, okay? Of those, one, Max Wiedman, who is my -- also my first cousin, served in the British army and then in the Intelligence, because he spoke, of course, very well the language of Germany. He served in Germany an -- as a -- an Intelligence officer after the war an-and after- before the [indecipherable]. Two of them were in England, one then emigrated to the United States and that\u2019s where we stayed when we first came. Anyway, the one who survived Auschwitz then married another survivor of the concentration camp and they were shipped out to then Palestine, and he established a sausage Interview with Alfred Lakritz \u00b0 April 3, 2008 store or whatever in -- in -- in -- probably in Haifa if I remember correctly. And he died, and one of -- and one of his child -- his son is the -- a -- a vice president or some position like that in the Weizmann Institute in Belgium. And --"

Now, one of my cousins grew up in Cologne, and she was sent by her parents to Palestine in 1937. She -- I think her name is Ruth, right now. She became one of the early kibbutzim in then Palestine. She became a labor leader. She was extremely active in -- 1n politics in -- 1n -- in -- and in the kibbutz movement in -- in Palestine. And she, like the son of the Auschwitz survivor, and Max Weidman who was in England, us four were the surviving children of this family, other than my brother.

One of the things that hurts I think the most about what happened to my family, and I\u2019m sure many families, 1s that they were totally, completely innocent, because they were totally good people. And the injustice of what happens to my family, as it is to thousands and maybe millions of others, who were just as innocent, just as good, just as nice, is what makes, in my view, the Holocaust such a monstrous crime. Now, my parents as I said, right, my father worked directly for his father. A good son, a loving son. His parents, my grandparents were wonderful, loving, religious, good people. My father and mother were tremendously good people. And they didn\u2019t do anything -- and I have to say this at the beginning -- anything to deserve anything of what happened to them.

God has given me the gift, right, to be able to remember so that I can testify to what I saw and experienced, what happened to of -- my family, of course, and others. On the train, as I explained to you, I remember this tremendous impact to me, of seeing men praying -- which of course I had seen, you know, I saw my father pray every day, I went to the synagogue of my grandfather. I don\u2019t know how many Interview with Alfred Lakritz \" April 3, 2008 times, but I went there. I\u2019m sure [indecipherable] in the company of my mother. But here was something that really struck me as a four year old child, here were these men standing with their tallis and their hats and their yarmulkes praying and crying. They all understood that the German government, the German rulers had decided to -- because they came and arrested all these people, right, and said all you can do is take whatever, yo-you know, you can carry it in hand. You\u2019re leaving everything behind, right? You\u2019re abandoning everything, we\u2019re transporting you, we\u2019re shipping you back to where you belong in Poland. And they were crying. And to a four year old child, right, the sight of men, right, that obviously a child only understands, you know, the strength and the absolute of parents, here were these men crying. And I\u2019m sure maybe my father was crying. And I -- this was a real shock to me, yes. And later I-I was told -- of course I didn\u2019t understand anything that was going on -- later on I was told by my mother -- not then, of course, years later, that that day Poland had had it. It did not want to accept any more Jews being transported or expelled, you know, from Germany into their country for whatever reasons they decided to do that. And our train, as far as my mother is concerned, our train was the train that was not allowed into Germany and it was sent back. So we were sent back to Kiel. Now, the second phase, right, of -- of my story has to do with how long, right, and this -- the legal system, both in Germany, then in Interview with Alfred Lakritz \" April 3, 2008 Belgium, then in France, came and played a part on how Jews were treated. And so I understand, right. When I was born the Aryan laws were established, right, okay, with all its limitation and so forth. But I also wi -- and I believe, I\u2019m informed that after Kristallnacht further laws were imposed and restrictions on Jews, you know, which limited their employment, their op-opportunity to survive, you know, everything was done obviously, to make it as difficult, you know, for them in hardship. Okay, so in my family, what happened 1s, I believe that early 1n this ballgame, the persecution of Jews was directed against my family as it was against others, and I will tell you why. For some reason my mother became very concern about their -- the future. For herself and for her children and for her husband. So she wrote -- I had a great heeha -- a great-uncle, her uncle, Uncle Max Fass, who lived in Oakland, California. And he had become a very successful businessman. And she wrote to him, and I have one of her letters that she wrote to him, asking him to sponsor us to immigrate to the United States. His application was approved, visas and -- and our permission to enter the United States was approved in 1935. He had paid for the transportation with the Hamburg America line. We had everything. The only thing we didn\u2019t have is the final stamp of the exit from Germany."

They had to go to Hamburg to get these exit visas stamped and approved. I believe that the story is this, is that my father, being a religious Jew did not on the Shabbas or on this [indecipherable] holiday, carry any money. And so he didn\u2019t know, as smart as he was he did not know that they would require some payment for the exit permit. That\u2019s what I understand. He did not have it. So he asked them when he found out, Pll come back tomorrow when I can bring money. I have money. They had everything, okay, including the Hamburg line, you know, confirmation, you know, wh-which I have a copy of. Okay. The Nazi said no. Okay, now you have to understand, I was born in the city that I believe was one of the ultra-nationalistic Nazi cities, that\u2019s what I believe. That was where all the you -- the German si -- U-boats, submarines were located. That\u2019s where German armament ships an-an-and submarines were manufactured, I believe that by slave labor, right, who were gathered from wherever. I believe that was owned by Krup, okay, I am not certain, but I am. Okay. In -- if I spoke and read German I could tell you better, you know, than what I believe. But among the books that were given to me by the Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 city of Kiel -- you know, they proudly displayed, you know, their pre-World War II history, their World War II history and the post-World War history. And my family is there in the pre-war, my -- my cousins, you know, in the -- in the Hebrew schools are all over, you know, in their book. Their pictures are all over, hanging in the museum of Kiel, which is outside the city, you know, gigantic photographs of members of my family. In fact, Max Weidman, when we were going touring that -- that -- that museum, he said to me, see, that\u2019s my picture, that\u2019s me. He says, how could it be that I\u2019m in a museum? We\u2019re looking at my face on the wall? That is abnormal. Anyway, but seven of my cousins are in these photographs in the Jewish schools of Kiel.

And that had started, and that\u2019s where it was at. It started early in the ballgame, because our denial of exiting Germany in 1935, when we had everything approved by the Interview with Alfred Lakritz a April 3, 2008 United States an-and e-e-everything, right, was denied because he was in the -- an observant Jew and he did not carry money.

            "answer": "-- y-yeah, that the only marriage that they had was a religious marriage. They were all religious, okay, and the record of their marriages and birth were recorded in the synagogues, but not -- they didn\u2019t marry civilly in that area. Now, in Germany the requirement is that you marry civilly and religiously, but that the only marriage which is valid and recorded and recognized is the civil marriage. Well, I\u2019m giving credit to the bastards, okay? No, no, I have better words for them, but I am giving Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Lakritz \u201c April 3, 2008 this much as a lawyer, right? A little bit of credit that -- th-that they used the law to then follow up and do the following monstrosity. They demanded, I believe, this evidence, the evidence that my -- my father\u2019s birth certificate. Now, I don\u2019t know that he had any kind of evidence, so they -- he didn\u2019t have it, let\u2019s assume, okay, because obviously he wasn\u2019t civilly registered at his birth. So then they demanded proof that his parents were civilly married and they had not been, apparently. So what they did is this: they demanded of my grandfather that he sign an affidavit, and I have a copy of it. I have the original an -- I mean, I have a -- a -- a -- a copy of it. And in that affidavit, okay I cannot describe totally every word, but what I understand from this affidavit that he was forced to sign, he was forced to say that my father was his bastard child. Remember, this was the sixth child of his wife and himself, right? This is a devout, you know, couple. My -- my grandmother didn\u2019t even have her -- you know, she followed the -- the Jewish Orthodox custom of wearing, you know, a wig. I mean, this is about as gross a monstrosity, you know, other than -- to debase human being, right. And this affidavit that I have a copy of, right, attests to the fact that his son Simche, right, is his bastard child. So now, what they did is they forced a -- a -- a family name change of my father, my mother, myself and my brother. No, not my brother. No, he wasn\u2019t born then. This was in 1935. So my pursuit and obsession is, to some degree it is to know who we were, Interview with Alfred Lakritz oS April 3, 2008 what we were, where we come from, you know, wh-why -- who were we. Who were these people who were killed in this unjustified manner? So I, in 1988 went to the consulate of Germany in Los Angeles and I was received by -- and I explained to them on the telephone -- and I explained to whoever I-I spoke to, and I suppose it was the legal officer on the -- of the consulate, what I was after. And what I was after in 19 dia -- \u201988 is the beginning of my pursuit to try to prove what happened to my family, so that I could understand, so that I could know, but also so that I could tell my wife, my children and my grandchildren and so on, whatever future we have in this earth, of what happened to their fore-parents and how wrong this was and how this should never happen again, to anybody. So I went to the consulate, I was received with extreme courtesy, both by the legal officer and the vice-consul. Both were extremely nice to me, I -- and I explained to them who -- of course, who I was, an-and what my interest was, you know, and as a lawyer, you know, practicing in Los Angeles, they were extremely professionally connected to me. They were connected also intellectually, I mean, they -- you know, and they were young, you know, people, as I was. And so our discussions were very frank. And so they asked me a little bit of my history and I told them, you know, where I come from, where my family comes from, you know, and what happened. And so they se -- I told Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Lakritz os April 3, 2008 them, what I want to do is to establi -- I want a copy of my original birth certificate. I want to know why my name was changed."

And I had a story to tell about that, but anyway -- but Lakritz is the family name, okay. And my brother, when I had the evidence and I asked him in front of his children and my children, come on, we can change our name. And he says, it\u2019s too late.

But this is something I carry with tremendous resentment. I have resented that they changed my name. I resent it today, I si -- resent it every day. This is one of the burning things that burns to me. So th-the fact that they denied employment, that they denied exit, that they denied my name, that they imprison us and wanted to deport us with anything and that ultimately the only thing left was for us to escape, which they did -- we did, of Interview with Alfred Lakritz \u201c April 3, 2008 course 1-illegally from Germany into Belgium. These were the beginning of part of the picture, I believe, that affected of course, many, many Jews, right, many ordinary Jews. We were ordinary people, right. And this is the beginning of my life. And it is something that I have to say, that I am sure has marked my personality and my attitudes and maybe my choice of profession and my relationship to wife and children and others, because I believe that a child who 1s treated 1n this way, and in what follows, including the two years of being hidden in France and thinking we had been -- we had no longer had any parents, I believe that this is one of the most monstrous of crimes that\u2019s committed. The rapes and the killing that is done and was done, and is done today, right, against 1-innocent people, you know, in different parts of the world I won\u2019t name now, but -- but we\u2019ve had several genocides and one or two are going on right now. The aftereffect of what this has to those people who are the victim is something that unfortunately is not understood, maybe rightfully so, and is not, I think, shared. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gi -- ging -- giving credit to these poor people. So it\u2019s not just because it happened to me, but I am speaking, you understand that, for them, you know. It was real for me, it is real for me now and it will be real for them, you know, whether they are over there in Africa, you know, or in Asia where it happened, or in other places. So we should not and cannot think of the Holocaust or the other genocides that have occurred simply in the numbers, Interview with Alfred Lakritz \u201d April 3, 2008 right.

And we were able to remain in France only by police authority and permits, which had to be renewed every 30 days.

And this celebration was one of the games of the German and the Vichy government. In this little city of 15,000 people, thereabouts, there was to be a nationalistic event to celebrate how France, right, had a future and France survived and France was in honor in f -- 1n spite of its defeat, in f -- in spite of its -- that they had cut th-the country in God knows what, the portion. The Vichy government was, of course, the southern parts of -- of France. I was then in the Vichy government section of France and Germany had taken say two-thirds a-as far as their dependent state. And that Vichy government supposedly was an independent part of France, okay. Under the Vichy government, Vichy is simply because that\u2019s where the -- the government of Marshal Petain was allowed to -- to be. There\u2019s two parts to this story, neither one of them good, about France. This prefect, or this government employee came to this city for this national celebration, and what was the purpose of it? The purpose was to invigorate the people, that their lot, being a defeated people, conquered people now, under the boot of the Germans, whom they hated, right, whom they had fought 1n two wars, in the 1870 wars and the 1914-18 wars. France- French people did not like the Germans, the boche they called them, that\u2019s the Interview with Alfred Lakritz . April 3, 2008 hated term, right, equal to the pigs. Now, the pigs, the boche now were in charge of France, and they had taken two-thirds of France. They had taken, you know, the big city, Paris in the north and then all the industrial wealth and the coal, and all of the -- the -- in the east, Normandy and -- and -- and -- and th-the glory. And they left a little southern part, which was agricultural, you know, and wine country and then the Cote d\u2019Azur and then the access to Spain. Basically a region without power, without economy, other than agricultural, and you know, where th-there was not th-th-the great population, you know, that you have in Paris, and with Lyon and so forth, so forth. Okay, now, this guy came for one purpose and that purpose was to reinvigorate these people out of the sense of defeat and so forth, and they had this big celebration. So my father was one of those employed to set this party up, okay. What followed either preceded this or followed this is the imposition now of French laws, which equaled and in some ca -- exceeded the anti-Semitism of the German laws. Now, as a lawyer, you know, throughout my history, and the purpose of my giving this testimony is not merely to relate, you know, pain and suffering and death and numbers. It is to relate the context. The context, what happened, right, to the Jews of -- of my family, is the persecution, the anti-Semitism, the hate, right, the monstrosity, right, that they created. The Germans created, right -- these guys fantasized and invented a system of super race and super -- you know the history, Interview with Alfred Lakritz \u201d April 3, 2008 you don\u2019t want me to talk, but it is important in my part of the story that now French laws follows and equates, right, in its anti-Semitism and a -- and its limitation on -- on -- on the rights of Jews, and certainly absolutely on the rights of immigrant Jews. And in France, with a history of anti-Semitism, of Catholicism, of teaching of the hatred of the Jewish people, right. We were the damned people, the condemned people, even though we were the -- the creators of their religion and supposedly, you know, ours was the-the-their chosen God, you know. Anyway, the French, not just in the Dreyfus Affair, but had a history of anti-sem -- Semitism and that history, even though it was not, you know, on the surface, it existed in reality. And I became now a part of that history. And my history is how these people dealt with all of these formulas, all of these factors that were facing them, the Christian, right, French. And I now am in this milieu, in this -- and how these people deal with the world as it\u2019s evolving out of their control, and the minimal amount of their choice, or the choices that they make either actively or passively, with regard to people like me, is part of the reflection of their religious education, their family education, right, and their laws. And the laws of France, to the shame of France, right, went to adopt German anti-Semitic laws and gave to the -- to the Germans the right to dictate to the Vichy government what the French police, the French states and the French functionary would do to the Jews, particularly the refugee -- refugee Jews.

Did you also Interview with Alfred Lakritz * April 3, 2008 choose us to be this ultimate suffer -- and if we have been chosen, right, for that, then my story is the testament that I want to leave to my children, grandchildren an- and generations forever, because if there is a truth here, then there 1s an equal truth here.

Okay, now I went to that school, and I remember learning to count with sticks, and so we had sticks, packs of 10, right, and Interview with Alfred Lakritz ~ April 3, 2008 we had a rubber band around them an-and that -- we learned to count there. Okay, I remember that, but I also remember something else that was not so nice. I remember the other boys -- other boys, they grabbed me and they tied me or something to the fence and they said that I was the Christ killer and that they wanted to punish me or whatever it 1s, and -- I told this story also to this French historian and she reported it in her book, and I am sure this happened. That\u2019s why she reported it in her book. That in this environment of Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil, you have this play of attitudes of people. Here is this family being helped and sheltered, allowed to survive, when nobody was allowed to give work to the refugee Jews, and yet they did. And at the same time, the children of others of the age of six and seven, equal to me, target me as a Christ killer. And obviously they didn\u2019t come up on this on their own. Obviously this was taught to them. Obviously this underlines what was happening and the crimes of the Catholic church are now descended on me. And they descend on my father, because what follows, right, is a choice made by French police, and French government and French -- and I have that whole testimony laying around that I will tell, about one of the men who had the power and didn\u2019t exercise it to save my father\u2019s life, but who confessed to me that if he had known that the chief of police, his friend, right, he was the exec -- my friend Guyaux, right? Gerard Guyaux, a man of extremely great kindness and character. This man, at -- one of the Interview with Alfred Lakritz .\" April 3, 2008 times I went back to France, and this time to reward him for what he did for my mother, my father\u2019s memory and for us. I gave him a plaque as I gave to others. And this man said to me -- admitted something to me, and he says, there\u2019s nothing they can do to me any more, I\u2019m too old, but I could have saved your father\u2019s life. And if you blew a bomb right there in front of me, I -- I don\u2019t think -- among the many, many shocks that I\u2019ve had in life, this was one. And he -- and he explained to me why. He said to me, when they ordered the arrest of your father, and I participated in the arrest -- cause he was the chief officer of the city of Marmande, and Saint- Pardoux is within the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the power and the sphere -- the space -- the jurisdictional surrounding of Marmande, under its jurisdiction. He said, I could have saved him, but I didn\u2019t know that the police, the chief of police, was of the same mind as I, that we didn\u2019t want this killing of innocent Jews. We didn\u2019t want to make the choice between refugee Jews and French-born Jews. But I didn\u2019t know that, and he didn\u2019t know I could trust him, and I didn\u2019t know I could trust him. And so when your father was ordered to be arrested in March 1942, he was arrested, obviously, with the consent and the cooperation of the city of Kiel, and the police of Kiel and of him."

            "question": "Kiel? Interview with Alfred Lakritz \" April 3, 2008",
            "answer": "I mean of -- of -- of Marmande. I am sure that the things that he did for my mother after the war and for my brother and I was to repent and to atone for what he had done. I\u2019m telling you, my father\u2019s name stands on the war memorial of -- of Marmande. My father\u2019s name also is in another memorial farther in France, I don\u2019t know where [indecipherable], course he is in there and the memorial to the Jews that were deported from France, which is in Paris, that they have built in recent years. But the one in Marmande is the one that means something. He became the major of the city of Marmande. He became the representative from that region to the assem -- French assembly. He was a -- a man of tremendous personality and character, and again, a very religious man, a very French man. And again, they -- this interplay, you know, of -- of -- of what they feel, what they do, and what they -- and who they are, all right? It -- 1t plays into this whole -- you know? And what follows again 1s this conflict, between others who are obeying orders, others who are willingly passive, others who are willingly complicit and others who are morally -- a-a-a-a-abhor, and afraid or you know, feel impotent to do anything. And so all of these people, I meet all of them. So, when I\u2019m in school I\u2019m treated well by the teacher and a -- you know, I\u2019m allowed in school, and I\u2019m just a normal kid. But the kids in the playground, I\u2019m not the normal kid, I\u2019m a Jew, dirty Jew, right? The Berny family, one of their son is the guy who is the vicar to the church. The church Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Lakritz \u00b0\u00b0 April 3, 2008 is -- in this hamlet there is a very prominent church, a very beautiful church [indecipherable] in the Marshal Feron, right, and the rest of it are farms, and this is a very, you know, beautiful, other than the school. Anyway, I remember many things. And one time I went back and the son of Berny, right, who had quit the monastery, you know, when I met him, I did -- you know, when the -- you know. So he didn\u2019t become a full fledged priest or monk, or you know. He chose not to. So when we revisited one time, my wife and I, the first time we went there, I took my children, and I couldn\u2019t enter the building, that chicken coop, it was locked and there was nobody around, you know. But another time we came back and they were there, the Bernys. And so they -- he took me around. And he said to me, you were an extraordinary child. He says, you learned the patois, which is the local French. You learned it in no time at all, you could speak it as well as anybody. And he says, you used to sit on my lap and I would read you stories, you know. He says, I was amazed that you could speak French, you know, you could speak the patois, and obviously I understood my parents who spoke German. And they were learning, you know, French too. And so, I guess he really liked me, and well, a lot of people, you know, a-as a child that I was liked. But above all, my brother was liked more. You know, he was a very loving and the second child in family, or the second boy in the family, they\u2019re always innocent, they\u2019re always sweet, right? And so he was. Now, for some Interview with Alfred Lakritz \u201c April 3, 2008 reason my mother, to help us 1n our survival, got a sewing machine and she started to sew. And because of the hard work of my father, you know, toiling in -- in other people\u2019s jardin -- gardens, my mother started to do seamstress work. And because of that she was able to survive, through that skill. Now, the life for us in -- in Saint- Pardoux-du-Breuil is a very interesting -- it\u2019s very pastoral, it\u2019s very country, it\u2019s a little hamlet. Everything -- you walk. If there is any transportation it is by either camp -- two cows pulling a wagon, or one horse pulling a wagon. I remember many men many times -- my mother would send me to this farm to buy some milk or to send me someplace to get bread and you had to go there, walk there. And once in awhile, you know, people would give me rides, you know, on these wagon. I remember everybody was so nice, they would give you a ride, you know. And I remember walking on this little street and they grew watercress, and that was wonderful. I remember. But anyway -- and my father cultivated a garden and -- in our -- 1n our -- in the side yard. And I remember that he used human excrement as part of the fertilizer, and we were together. And a lot of it was happy, and some of it- Iremember my father getting mad at me and yelling at me, and my mother protecting me and I was running around my mother\u2019s skirts, and holding onto her skirt when he was yelling at me and my mother was yelling back at my father to shut up and whatever. Anyway, here comes June, July, 1942. I am just eight years old, Interview with Alfred Lakritz \u201c April 3, 2008 and I am now condemned to become an adult. My parents decide, through some Jewish agency, whatever, to send us to a summer camp. And we leave Marmande, Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil. | remember the railroad station, my parents bringing us to the railroad station. I remember the last look I had of my father ever, there waiting on the quay, or the -- what we call -- what do we call? Well, whatever we call now, with my mother --"

            "answer": "Right. Now, we\u2019re in this camp with Jewish children, run by Jewish adult leaders and -- and everything is wonderful and normal and so forth, as far as a child 1s concerned. It\u2019s play, it\u2019s hiking, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s everything, it\u2019s games. Suddenly there is a day that I can never forget. I\u2019m brought in with my brother to the office of Mr. Kohn. [ only know his name by the fact that I have four of the letters of my father of what prompted that particular meeting. And this Mr. Kohn says to me and my brother that our parents want us to stay with them. And I then develop terror. I don\u2019t think there is any other word to describe what I felt then. I saw out of the window that other children were leaving with their baggage, whatever th-they ha -- they had and here is me and my brother in this dark office and this man at this desk telling me that my parents don\u2019t want us to go home, that they want us to stay. And I have a brother who is not even six years old. I am just eight years old, and I am now put in a position that I have to understand, or cope and deal with the idea that somehow our parents don\u2019t want us to come home, but other children are going home to their parents. I am not going. That\u2019s impossible. There is no way you can explain my Interview with Alfred Lakritz \"\u00b0 April 3, 2008 absolute connect. This is the first time I\u2019d ever left my parents, ever, and they -- they send me on the summer camp with other children, to play and have fun. That\u2019s -- okay? Other children were there to play and to f -- have fun, too. But that they should go home to their parent, and I -- they want us to stay? That is a moment of absolute terror. Total incomprehension. Th-There is nothing that can describe it, nothing that can describe my feeling at that moment. I am paralyzed, I am horrified, I am scared, I cannot comprehend. This is one moment in my life where nothing makes any sense. And believe me, that has impacted my life forever. That moment. That revelation. And of course I had no understanding what, why, but the total incomprehension. I mean how could my parents, you understand, make this judgment? They -- it\u2019s impossible. Anyway, I remember being there, and from that moment, for the next two and a half years, I became the guardian of my brother. And I became obsessed that he should never be separated from me for a moment, because I was afraid of what was going to happen. If he was separated they may take him away from me, an-and no way. So, I succeeded in most terms, but there was a period of time when he was housed someplace and I was housed in another one, but that became an obsession with me, that I would go into freaky periods if they suggested anything that I should be separated from my brother, or my brother should be separated from me. So these other children went home, and a few children stayed. Interview with Alfred Lakritz *\" April 3, 2008 And we stayed with these, some of the Jewish -- for lack of another term, I mean they were adult supervisor, guardians, whatever you want to call them, in this camp. Now, they then proceeded on a plan, and the plan I can only describe is a plan of survival of our people. They put us through the ritual of every holiday, we had to observe them absolutely. We had to put handkerchiefs on our wrist on Shabbas, we had to observe every holiday religiously. I remember the last one we observed was Sukkoth. I -- 1-1-1n that place in -- in -- in -- one of them had drawn a map of -- of Israel -- Palestine on -- on a -- a thing with a light bulb behind it, and this was in blue, th-the -- the whole region. I remember that very well. I remember games being played, you know, then they would toss us in -- in blankets, you understand, I mean, we were little kids."

That they were teaching us only about Judaism, only about our religion, only about the Promised Land, only about the -- I remember that. And I have the absolute conviction that these people were trying to preserve our religion and our people in th -- whatever means they had, and that -- in the hope that some of us would survive. Now, I remember several incidents, but let me tell you one. And this incident is recalled by another child, not necessarily in the same place, but the same event happened to him. And of course I don\u2019t know him, and I didn't know, but in the French book that was written by this French historian of the Jews, what happened, the Jews in the Lot-et-Garonne of France that she researched, among the many people she interviewed, she interviewed another survivor who told her the very same story. And I don\u2019t know him, he doesn\u2019t know me. But the story basically is this. I remember that those people change our names. And so my name was changed from Lakritz to LaCroix. LaCroix means the cross. It\u2019s a very French name. And one day they told me, and the other children too, we\u2019re going to have Interview with Alfred Lakritz .\" April 3, 2008 these people visiting and they\u2019re going to ask you some questions, and when they do, when they ask for your name, make sure, don\u2019t forget, give them your new name of LaCroix. So now I am eight years old, I have a new name and now there are people coming to interrogate us. And so sure enough these people came. I remember a woman, very well dressed, and some other man, but I remember the woman, she talked to me. And I told this story to the French historian, among many stories that I told her -- not many, but anyway -- and she reported that story in her book, right. And she gives credit to someone else telling her the same story, some guy who now lives in -- in San Diego, and who also had the same kind of -- the same people. Well, these people were Quakers, and this was an organization of Quaker, where they tried to save some of the children from France and to ship them to England or America, and I remember that afterwards, you understand, we understood that these people were there to try to save us an-and ship us by -- by ship, but that became too dangerous and we could not leave. But I also remember that by that time I was a bed wetter and boys, other boys were making fun of me and they were trying to get me to stop and -- and the way they hope was they wouldn\u2019t allow me to change my bed, and so every night I had to sleep in a bed that was full of, to put it in plain vernacular, piss, right. Smelled like hell. A-And that was my punishment, my sort of- they\u2019re trying to teach me not to do it. Now, I\u2019m sure e-everybody that has any Interview with Alfred Lakritz \u201d April 3, 2008 education about children understand what I didn\u2019t know, is that I was so traumatized, I was so terrorized, I was in such pain, right, that that\u2019s how it is. And obviously no child should be treated this way. But of course it was not their doing, obviously they were saving us, protecting us, hoping that we could survive and -- and continue our people. To that extent, they succeeded. These were heroes. I owe them everything. Even though later I gave some of that to the nuns who sheltered me also, Catholic nuns, I give credit and my life wouldn\u2019t be what it is or could have been if it wasn\u2019t for my parents, and if 1t wasn\u2019t for them and if it wasn\u2019t for Christians that [indecipherable] follow my story. Numerous human beings who behaved at the risk of their lives and their liberties. And this is no speech, this 1s a fact. Anyway, from the Creuse, from that -- we went to another place and when I saw a few years ago a movie called, \u201cThe Children of Chabanne\u2019, | said, I remember that place. I was there. I was one of the children that was sheltered in that chateau of the French journalist and these two, also all Christian teachers who sheltered Jewish children, orphan children, who had to fight off, you know, th-the -- the police who wanted or were curious, who -- wh-what are you doing with these children? What did -- where\u2019d they come from? And of course if they were Jewish children they were to be arrested and turned over to the French police who would Interview with Alfred Lakritz m April 3, 2008 then turn them over to the -- to the Nazi.

And they made various choices, some totally idiotic, you know, doesn\u2019t make any sense, but -- so some people were allowed to keep children, and others were -- the children were to be arrested with their parents and sent to this camp in Casanuri. Casanuri was in the department of Lot-et-Garonne. And shortly after my father and mother sent these letters to the camp director and to my uncle, great-uncle in Oakland, they were arrested by the French police, the both of them were put in this camp at Casanuri. And among the idiosyncrasies of the French, one of the exceptions that they made for th-the Interview with Alfred Lakritz \u00ae April 3, 2008 incarcerated Jews was that if a woman was pregnant, they would release the couple. So my mother, in her usual good sense and courage, told them she was pregnant. So she was examined by the doctor and the nurses and the doctor and nurses said she was pregnant. The book researched by this wonderful Christian writer of the history of the Jews -- and I came at the tail end of her research. I came just before the publication. So obviously she didn't record this from my say-so. She had recorded all of this. Her name is Marie-Juliette Vielcazat Petitcol. Her book is, Terre de -- d\u2019Exile, Terre d\u2019 Asile. It was pe -- published in 2006 and she -- she was telling me she was finishing and the books was going to get printed. Among the many things that she had discovered, well before me, was where my parents were incarcerated in a ca -- I didn\u2019t know where they were. And when I told her I don\u2019t know where they were, she said, but I know. And I said, this is what I know happened in the camp, cause my mother told me. You know, she feigned to be pregnant and that th-the doctor of the camp and the nurse said the -- they confirmed that, even though she wasn\u2019t. And as a result, my parents were allowed out of the camp. I\u2019m going to tell you a historical fact, that if we had been with my parents in Casanuri at the time they were arrested, we would all be dead, because the French categorization of who is going to be shipped in to Drancy and then to -- to Auschwitz, at the time, in 1942, and then th-the enormous amount of Jews who were, and were shipped, th- Interview with Alfred Lakritz \u201d April 3, 2008 they were all wiped out. They were all killed in the concentration camp. The only thing that saved us was these two events. The fact that my parents, right, decided that we should not come home, and that strangers had a better chance to save us than they did, cause they were helpless. And then comes this other story, that my mother, you know, tells this story to the doctor, and the doctor says, yes, you are pregnant, confirmed that. And this fine human being with these fine nurses -- they are named in here, in this book. And you know, if I said it privately to you before the start, or I said it otherwise, I think I have come to a time where almost every important event in the history of the persecution of my family, and I\u2019m talking about my immediate family, that I have gotten the evidence. And you will hear, as we go along that that history goes to today. That there is a memorial now in Kiel, Germany, where there was no memorial, only because of me. Because when I visited Germany, I asked them, you know, I -- the only memorial that you have that remains, of the presence, and the persecution of Jews in Kiel is a little marker on the side of the curb of the street where the synagogue was burned, the main synagogue of Kiel. Other than that they had no memorial to the Jews or to the -- to the concentration camp, or to the -- the whole Holocaust, nothing. So when I went there, I asked them, I will pay for it. I will pay, you know, if you make a memorial. And what that memorial should consist of -- I understood the environment -- I said, it is a plaque like you did for the Interview with Alfred Lakritz ia April 3, 2008 Temple, except with the plaque, plant a living tree. And I want you to know that the governor of the state wrote to me in 2005 -- I went there in 2000 -- and they have such a memorial and a living tree. And two of my cousins were invited to come to the inauguration, and the one who 1s the vice president of the Weizmann Institute, the son of the Eichmann survivor, is the one who spoke, right. And again, in the -- in the -- in the stories that were published, again it\u2019s of my family, right, and all of it tracing to the -- my grandfather and th-the -- the photos of the ceremony, of the monument on the back of -- of the -- one of the buildings, the synagogue of my grandfather, and here 1s also in one of the other newspapers, several of them, you know, were sent to me, is this Christian couple. And this Christian couple is the reasons we were invited to Kiel. They are the ones who sa -- researched the documents for me in Kiel, other than what I obtained on my own. They are another evidence of the -- th-the -- the goodness and -- and the fact that people do care, and they care immensely, because they -- they suggested to the city that they should honor those Jews who survived and who were born in the city of Kiel.

When you were ch -- those two and a ha -- two years, two and a half years you were with your brother, alone with him, did you talk about your parents a lot? You said you had no communication in the beginning even, from your parents.",
            "answer": "Okay, there are many things I remember about that period. It\u2019s difficult for me to recall any particular conversation I had with my brother. It 1s not difficult for me to recall a number of events that I remember very specifically. The one thing I expressed earlier, and I say it again because it helps to explain; I had an obsession and fear, absolute fear, that I would be separated from my brother and he from me. I mean, this was an absolute fear. And obviously that fear is clearly tempered and explained by the fact that we were suddenly separated from our parents, right, without any comprehension or explanation by anybody. So now what happens in this episode to my brother and I for two and a half years 1s that we are in the company of other Jewish children, so they are contemporaries. Some are older, right, many years older, cause we\u2019re very little, and some of them are about our age, and we play and -- and -- and do things like little children. One of the frightful memories that I remember is my wife and I went for two weeks to a place in -- in the south -- I mean in the west -- I mean the east part of France call -- a city called Anisy. We Interview with Alfred Lakritz ia April 3, 2008 went there to attend a French school provided to foreigners and we thought that would be really fun for her and I to go to French school, and she would learn a little French. In the meantime we have two weeks of vacation. And during that two week period, one day -- I mean, every weekend I would take her and we would go around. And one of the points that I tried to find, I tried to find where I loo -- I was hidden in the upper plateau of a big city called Evian, on the lake -- on the shore of the lake Geneva. And so one of them was this big house in -- in -- which is in one of the pictures, and I wanted to find this place. Now anyway, so one of those weekends we went someplace else, and this very nice woman w -- we had to find lodging, we had no reservation, so she offered us a room in -- in her big house, whatever it was, a hostel and so on. And some story about that her son -- I was looking to locate this place and that her son might know something, you understand, that he was cognizant of the history and th -- and th-the -- during the wartime and the resistance that occurred there and the -- the Jews. And so we went to her place, and she showed us the room, and it was terrible. Anyway, so we didn\u2019t want to stay there. But as we walked out, there was a queue -- a line of little children going to dinner, I guess, or coming from dinner, I don\u2019t remember exactly, my wife will remember. And I was absolutely thrown back to that time when this reminded me about me, about me and the other children, that this is how we were, we went on line, everything, everything Interview with Alfred Lakritz ia April 3, 2008 we did was in part of the others and that we had little pajamas in this little house and I guess they were going to bed. I guess that\u2019s where they were. And I -- it was one of those moments where you\u2019re taken back to this memory. Anyway, these were times where we had the company of other children. Other children who were in the same boat as we were, and we knew we were in danger. We knew that we weren\u2019t allowed to go out and play, we were not allowed to do anything in the exterior, everything was done in the interior. In the Ault Sevoir we did something on the exterior, there yes. We went on hikes like in this one picture. I remember going 1n forests, I loved hiking, I loved forests, I loved nature. I remember those things. Then they sent us to Lourdes. Lourdes is, of course, the home of the historic religious event of Bernadette and there at first we were all together, placed in the pensionne and next to this pensionne were lodged these German Luftwaffe pilots. And we knew they were our enemy. And so I remember one day we had a snowball fight with these pilots. And I remember putting rocks, and the other boys did too, rocks 1n the middle of our snowball and sending them, you know. We knew these were --"

Now after, in the hotel -- up to then we\u2019re together, and then they move my brother. So now I -- I [indecipherable] okay, I cry, I scream, I -- God knows what I did. Anyway, but they assure me that I will see him and I will be with him and that I shouldn\u2019t worry, that he is going to be fine and I\u2019m going to be fine, but they have to separate us. And I am certain that they separated us because there was a danger, because our French maybe wasn\u2019t perfect, and he was younger, and he was innocent and he could speak up and give his real name and identity and then be discovered, then we both die. So I think they separated us there. In other place before that we were all with Jewish children, so it didn\u2019t matter. But there it matter, because we were hidden with all of these orphan Christian children, by the thousands, you understand. And I\u2019m sure that it was an act of preservation, to protect us. So they put him in this place and they put me in the convent, and I was in the convent on the grounds of the Basilica of Lourdes. The [indecipherable] magnifique and I was, I believe, the only child that was hid -- Jewish child hidden by these nuns on that -- in that convent. Now, it\u2019s really not a convent. What it really is, is a hospice. And it is the place where this Interview with Alfred Lakritz = April 3, 2008 order of nun take care of the medically invalid visitors to the city of Lourdes and they come there and these nuns are nurses and they nurse these people during their stay, right, which is provided for free, I\u2019m sure. And now comes the war, there\u2019s no travel, right, nobody can move, and now they have nothing to do and these children are being brought in, you know, by the government. Rounded up from France and -- and brought into the city cause it\u2019s -- they\u2019ve got the road, they got the hotels unoccupied. The state takes over all of those hotels, and they offered, obviously, to shelter some children. Incidentally, I want to go back to tell you one part of the story. Among -- and I haven\u2019t -- I haven\u2019t come to the further development of what happened to my mother and father, but one thing has to be said, is that my parents were totally, completely trapped. They had no means, no right, no power to move. They had no papers, and police, French police would stop people, you know, for identification and you know, identity card, you know, with photograph. I mean, there\u2019s no way you could move. So my mother one time told me about that they had to go somewhere, all right, even at the risk of their lives, but 1t was that important. What it was, I don\u2019t know. And so she described to me the -- the -- the -- the episode for my father and I. They would walk at night on the road and if they saw two lights, they knew they were policemens with their bicycle lights, and so they would jump into the -- Interview with Alfred Lakritz \u2122 April 3, 2008"

I said earlier that in my understanding of it, they were put there for easy picking, all right, by the French police. And the whole system was geared around keeping them there, locked in, with no escape and no means of escape. So now you can understand this couple, right. Now they say, oh my God, we have sent our children away and they\u2019re going to come arrest us. Now, okay, then comes the second judgment, well better they stay there in the protection of this organization then, cause we are trapped. We cannot escape, right.

That they were going to ship us to Palestine, which meant, obviously, that they all assumed that we were orphans and that our parents had been killed. And I knew that. And now this Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 100 Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 woman brought this news. This was the first word I had on my parents for two and a half years, almost. And I tell you, I told the story to these two French journalists, and I know one of them published it in his newspaper as the lead, you know, in his article and they reported when I came to thank the Italian farmers, I didn\u2019t talk about yet, about my mother, what happened to my mother. Well, they had hidden her for th -- a lot of that two and a half year period. And I went to publicly thank this family that I visited many, many, many times. I consider myself a part of their family, they consider me and my brother part of their family, certainly. They consider my mother part of their family. Anyway, I told these newsmen this, and -- and newspaper men and they considered that to be what I consider it, th -- not fully appreciating the content. Anyway, so shortly after that, by this Jewish organization we were taken and reunited with my mother. And I remember my mother there on the same platform of the same railroad station, standing just about exactly the same spot that I last saw her, say two and a half years before, with her close friend that she developed, this Madame Rozinsky, and her son, who became my close friend. And they were Jews of -- from Alsace-Lorraine and they were spared. They were spared in the town of ma -- Marmande, and two doors down was another Jewish family by the name of Alco, all of these were our friends after the war, and they were spared because they were French born. So in France that\u2019s another thing that happened. 101 Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 There was a very, very, very, you know, factual difference of who survived and who was not allowed to survive.

            "answer": "Her story is -- and I will tell you now, because a story -- history should know not just what she endured, but how I look at how she endured. I consider her about as great a woman, a mother as there can be, in fact, I call her an angel. After my father\u2019s arrest in February, at the end of February, 1943, she is left alone. She has no idea if her children are alive or dead, except th-there are a few photographs that are given to her. And she, of course, knows nothing of what happened to her husband. And so she is left there alone, right. And she speaks the language cause she picks up Interview with Alfred Lakritz _ April 3, 2008 the language fast. She\u2019s a seamstress, she is known by the farming families, you know, who use her. And one day she 1s asked by this Italian farmer\u2019s family, the Ros family, R-o-s to make a wedding dress for their one -- their second oldest daughter. So my mother makes this wedding dress for her, and she did, I guess, a reasonably good job. Then they ask her to make the suit for the groom. So she makes that. And from then on they are totally connected, and they become her protectors. So, they take her away, she is all alone, right, obviously a woman in tremendous pain and they give her a family and a home and a place. So this is two people who had immigrated from Italy when things were bad in northern Italy in the early 30\u2019s. And they became tenant farmers in -- in the southwest of France at a chateau called LeCook, and -- by a woman who was Madame deFerrier, a noble lady of -- not noble in act, of course she was noble in act, but her name was of the nobility. And the tenant farmers that they have 1s this family, Ros. And this couple, the Ros\u2019 are two magnificent -- magnificent human beings. They are farmers with a little education. They have six or seven children, right now I\u2019m not counting them, and they have this farm. And so they take her in and from time to time, you know, one of their son, you know transports my mother by bicycle to their farm, which is up on this hill, at the mas dejeuner. And she is all alone so they adopt her and they hide her. Their oldest son is ordered into Germany as part of the -- the -- the -- the 107 Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 German orders, it takes one child from certain families, you know, to -- as laborers in Germany, and he is one of them, and he\u2019s not there. So I guess in the sense they consoled themselves because they have some connect in that sense. Anyway, she spends a lot of time there, and they even hide her. One time I was taken through when I returned. When I was a child growing up there I wasn\u2019t interested in any of this, but when I returned with my wife and -- and children to LeCook, LeCook had been sold to a German couple, but they were -- they allowed us to come and visit that site. And I was then taken through the chateau, as I had been as a child, we used to play there all the time after the war. But I was shown a room in this chateau that had a secret wall, and my mother was hidden in that wall. So when police came to LeCook to check what\u2019s what, and so forth, so forth, they would hide her in this wall, you know, which was a fake wall. So, in my family so many things happened that happened to other Jews in other places and so on, even that happened. Anyway, these wonderful people kept her, nourished her, gave her support, moral and physical in that sense and helped her over this period. A photograph that I have of my mother shows her extreme pain. And she is in one picture shown, that\u2019s all I have, when she is with her sewing machine [indecipherable]. Then the next picture I have of her is two and a half years later when we\u2019re reunited with her. And she takes us with joy and pride, you know, to visit this family, to bring her sons. And the Interview with Alfred Lakritz _ April 3, 2008 pain in her eyes 1s so clear and her pride is so clear. And I have two photographs, you know, of that particular event, where she even made the clothes that we wear. And she is bringing her boys. And this family that I went and thanked and -- and so forth, called just two or three weeks ago. We haven\u2019t heard from you, where are you, what\u2019s happening? Why aren\u2019t you here, you know? And -- a-a-anyway --"

But one thing I want to say is this, because it ties into the first part, before I get to what happens here. One time I went to Jerusalem, to the Yad Vashem, again to find my roots. And this was 20 years ago, I think. It was -- well, it was on the anniversary of the state of Israel, so thi -- I know that. And I -- I think it was 20 years ago, but anyway -- and I went to the Yad Vashem to ask -- you know, to apply for -- I-I wanted to connect to my family, to my roots. And so I filled out a card and I went to hand it to the man at the counter, and the man looked at it and he said to me, the information for you isn\u2019t here. So I looked. He says, I have the information that you need. So I said, yeah? He says, I\u2019m going to bring it to you. In a little while he came back with these two gigantic books, and he says, there 1s what happened to your family. I didn\u2019t know what it was. I open the book and it\u2019s called Gedanta volume one and two, the collection of the Jews of West Germany killed by the Nazis as reported and recorded by the Nazi -- I mean, post-war by -- and in this book I looked under Lakritz and I don\u2019t find my father. So I decided to go under Weber, and I will tell you, 1f you would have exploded an atomic bomb, I don\u2019t think I would have been more shocked, more surprised, more in a state of total emotional disconnect and connect, ya -- total. I opened the book, I go to Weber, and 118 Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 the first thing I read is the name of Mirel Weber, geb Lakritz, from Kiel. That\u2019s my grandmother. So I run down, the next name I find is Simon, initial S, Lakritz Weber. And they put his place of residence and where he died, Majdanek, Lublin, sometime in 43. How in the world they restored to him his name of Weber as a memorial to him is -- I -- I totally without any comprehension. How they went through the records and restored to him his name, is unbelievable. So the connection to my pursuit of my name, my identity, my roots, here it is confirmed in the Gedanta book, handed to me in the Yad Vashem. And so I said -- and I looked then for the other relatives, the Weizmanns, and they\u2019re all recorded, anyway, everybody in the Weizner is in, they are recorded. Aunts and uncles and cousins whose deaths are recorded. Anyway, so now let me come to what happens in United States of America."

And of course I didn\u2019t know them, but of course I found out right away who they were. Anyway, so after we -- we cleared the -- everything else, I think I had to go to the bathroom. And so somebody, you understand, it was Friedel\u2019s husband, who was -- the husband 1s a -- was a tax1 driver, I remember in -- in Brooklyn. They lived in Brooklyn. My aunt and uncle had come from Oakland across the United States. I know those four people were there. And it must have been him, he took me to a bar to go to the toilet. And I saw a jukebox in this -- I had never seen a jukebox. I was amazed. This thing plays music. 121 Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 I was totally amazed.

And I use the word describing what the United States did, and this comes from a person who loves his country, this is my dream. This is a place where no human being, right, could have -- could have expected more than I got out of it. This is a country I would kiss the ground. I kissed the ground when I landed in New York, I kissed the ground on the [indecipherable]. I kissed the dra -- on my knees I kissed it. But I also kissed the ground of Sather Gate which is the entrance port of - to the University of California, Berkeley. And every time I walk under that gate and every time I answer -- enter the grounds of that university, I thank God, I thank America, | thank California for having allowed me and given me this unbelievable privilege that I never, never would have had in France or Germany. I and my brother were allowed with nothing, not even speaking the language, but at the end of three years of residence in this country, we were admitted to the University of California at Berkeley, the most pra -- predominant public institution in the world, right, and certainly predominant against an -- a-at that time against any university in 134 Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 the country. We were allowed to go there and to attend and to graduate. And he would have, if he wanted to, he would have gone the di -- post-graduate school, as I did. I went to Berkeley, to Bolt Hall. We were treated totally equally, fairly, justly. So in every sense the United States gave to -- every opportunity to us. We owe every bit of gratitude, you know, and thanks to the United States. I mean, look, we came here with nothing, with hope. And this beautiful land, this beautiful country, right, gave us every opportunity. But we had to earn it. And we lived through three years of high school without tutors, without aid, without assistance. We had to earn it. We earned it. And you know what, the rest of the way also we earned, without assistance, without help, right. This is a sink or swim society. Well, we survived. Thank God. But it is only in this beautiful land, right, that gives opportunity to so many people, and has, and does, you know. So I make a judgment on this country. I condemn for what happened during the war and the immediate post-war period, and I praise this country for the period since then.

            "answer": "It a -- and I would tell you in truth two things. I was a very caring and -- and loving father. I am still, but I had my faults. And part of my fault was that I grew up with a certain amount of insecurity and that insecurity strived for security to counterbalance. And as I evolve there was a mixture as a person, both of striving for certain security in terms of at least economic security, and striving to deal with anger. Throughout my life I think that the experience of my childhood has affected my personality in the sense that I am much more explosive or ex -- more explosive than I would have been otherwise. I\u2019m easy to get upset and I am -- once I explode, which 1s -- doesn\u2019t happen often, cause I -- I control it, or 1t doesn\u2019t give me rise to anger. But when I do explode, I explode. And so I was a father who was loving and caring an-and -- and -- and they could depend on. But if something went wrong or something was not right, they would hear about it plenty. And so in that sense my children have a certain amount of resentment to when I wasn\u2019t as kind or as considerate or as sensitive or as -- you know, I -- as I should have been. On the other 136 Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 hand, my children see -- at least my daughter does, because her two sons, our grandsons live close to us and we see them often, once a week at least, and we take them on vacation and so forth, so on. Then I\u2019m probably one of their best grandfathers that there is. So as much as I, in my pursuit of s -- trying to strive for security for them, once I achieved that, I also was the greatest -- oh -- th -- I -- what am I talking about with my [tape break].

As a trial lawyer I also see it, you know, that I can easily fire up and take intellectual insult or attack, you understand, by somebody\u2019s -- I think -- and I do it -- once I am attacked in that way, I become very foraci -- ferocious, I become like the bulldog who -- at your ankle. And I will have the last word. So, yes, in one sense, you understand, I have this anger. One thing that has helped me, truly, is many years ago I started to write some of my history, some of my memories, and that became a -- like a psychological therapy for me, in many ways. To recount for myself -- this is strictly, you know, me, some of these events, some of these experiences, some of those feelings, you know, that I have. And part of retelling and reminding myself and crying along the story, I think has helped me to -- to reconcile myself with the injustices that happened to my family. And I will 137 Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 say that I believe the reason I became a lawyer was to spend my life, to ensure to whatever degree I had, in capability of opportunity, to make sure that other people are treated fairly, according to deeds, not according to religion or not according to fate or chance. And after 47 years of -- as a lawyer, continuous practice of law in the state of California, I think I have done that with honor and -- so the aftereffect of the experience of the war is I haven\u2019t gone out and -- and -- and get a gun and shoot the Nazis or the Germans. I have not taken retaliation against them or others. I have accepted the fate that we had, never to forgive, never to forget. And that\u2019s an absolute. And I remember having lunch with this nun who was the as -- who was the assistant of the Cardinal Mahoney, the guy who is the Cardinal of all of southern California, one of the preeminent Cardinals in this country, and they had selected me for their -- I was the poster child for the 2000 -- the year 2000 of the reunification, or the year redemption between the Catholics and the Jews. And they had one edition that was devoted, and I was the centerfold story, in full color, in full everything. And a -- after it was done, she came and visited me in my office and we went to lunch together, and I expressed some of this feeling of my anger. My anger at what Pope Pius 12\" didn\u2019t do. What the Catholic archdi -- hierarchy did not do. The choices they made, and other Catholics eminence and nuns and -- and [indecipherable] you know. Sheltered and hid, saved Jews and the others did the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 138 Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 opposite. And I told her about these, you know, these mixed feelings. And she says - and I said never to forgive, never to forget. She said, of course you should never forget. But she says, for your own soul, for yourself, you should forgive. So I have to say that between my own therapy in writing about it and talking about it and myself and -- and so forth, and the message that she gave to me, somehow I matured and so I could bring myself to go back and accept the invitation of the state I was born, the city where I was born, to visit. And I did it. I was very curious to see where I was born, where I come from, you know, this part of my trip, you know, to get my roots. And I got it and I was very happy. I had no resentment, on the contrary. The mayor was a perfect English speaking person, who had married an English girl. All the people there spoke English perfectly."

It\u2019s a beautiful town, I just went to my granddaughter\u2019s Bat Mitzvah, and among the guests there 1s her -- h-her -- one of her uncles, and he works for the Pentagon, you know, in a secret, secret job. And he s-said he didn't know where I was born, and I told him, you know, cause I showed him this book, they all wanted to see it. So he said, Kiel, I was in Kiel.

He says -- he said to me, that\u2019s a beautiful city. I said yeah. And it\u2019s a university city. I said yeah. You know, anyway, I am amazed that many other survivors of the Holocaust that I have met over this period of my life survive what happened to them, and instead of quitting, instead of crying, instead of feeling sorry for themselves, they picked up, right, and said I\u2019m going forward, I\u2019m gonna live, I have to live. Right. They, you know, perished, you know, not by choice but by the hands of criminals and monsters. You know, whether they were the complicit one or the active one, but I\u2019m going to live. And so I met a number of them, including one who survived Auschwitz in the -- in a -- that Nazi symbol that was carved on his forehead, and he became one of the early establisher in Australia of the -- the mini- shopping malls.

So I -- you know, I don\u2019t -- I know -- no, thank God they -- they found him, they caught him, they tried him, they -- they gave him every chance and the guy confessed, with his damn set of excuses. You know, it\u2019s the same with the Germans today. When I was invited to Kiel with my cousins and I -- we were the guests of honor of Kiel [indecipherable] for seven or eight days, the time the -- the time that they invite thousands, I believe, of people who man different -- the ships, what are they called? With the -- sailboats, they come to regatta in -- in Kiel. Kiel is the, you know, so we were there during the whole week, the guest of honor. We were taken to every function, to meet everybody. And -- okay. When we had the reception there with the mayor and we had dinner with him, we had several things with him, and all -- all the other. So I was asked to, like my cousin, you know, we all were invited to write in the book, the city. There\u2019s pictures of me writing. When I was done writing, both good and bad, the mayor turned to me and he says, I want to give you something. And he went and got out of a drawer, a picture. And the picture 146 Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 is part of the aftermath of the war to the city of Kiel, and it shows, you know, a very- | have a copy I have included here -- a destroyed city during the winter in a very heavy snow, and you\u2019ve got a bunch of people who are walking on foot 1n this desolate, terrible, abysmal area of the remains of the city of Kiel. Well, of course, the whole city was not destroyed by the British and the American bombers. The access to the port were -- the property of my grandfather it was. But he gave me that so that I would get the other side of the coin, to which I\u2019m very sensitive. Well, we had dinner one night, he and I an-and my cousin. I asked him, wh-why did you people invite us? And he says, because when we have done it in the past, the goodwill that happened paid for whatever happened on both sides. But when we went, the newspaper reported our visit and I -- again, I did not read the whole thing, but the Christian couple who were responsible for bringing attention to us and getting the city and the state to invite us and to give us what I could say is a hundred and five percent, 10 percent, you know, anything that you could expect. I mean, I wa- it was magnificent. We had interpreter. The -- the Jewish historian Kristina Goldberg who is a professor there interviewed us and she wrote a whole thesis on it. She had written the history of our family, which is recorded in these books, right, my grandfather and -- and -- and the rest of us are all part of -- of -- you know, thesis and -- and -- and research that she did. But the newspaper wrote an article that the 147 Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 Christian couple, right, begrudge the expenditure by the city and the state for such a lavish state for us. So, you know, the Jewish people are very honored in the sense that we have survived by our own means and our own ability to survive.

            "answer": "Reparation. France paid her some money. We received my inheritance of my grandparents, you know, I mean the property was evaluated 1950 or \u201951. The seven of us all received the then appraised value of the land. That land is one of the most expensive, income producing land in the city of Kiel. Today the stadium was being rebuilt, you know, on that land. Of course, other land too, because it\u2019s very big and our property wasn\u2019t that big. And it is a place in Kiel, which is 1n the northern part of Germany, it\u2019s very cold. And all of the sports activity, conventions, or -- everything of income producing to the city occurs in that -- in that plaza. So we received an appraised value of 1950, of raw land. Thirty years later, 40 years later, as a lawyer I wanted to know. I wasn\u2019t interested then of the money, in fact, I hated them. I don\u2019t hate them more, you know, those who live in Germany today. I hate those who -- who sit back, committed all these crimes, yeah, I hated them. But not these that are here. And I ask because my cousins wanted to know, aren\u2019t we entitled to a proper inheritance, given the value of our property that was taken from us? And 148 Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 I asked attorneys for a Jewish, so forth, t-to advise me as to whether not we had rights. And I asked through the Christian couple for a set of lawyers in Kiel. I was willing to pay whatever it costs. And I had these meetings and I had these reviews and they told me to -- you waited too long. The Statute of Limitation barred any -- but we did inherit, so -- not much, but it helped to pay for our education. End of Tape Five, Side A Beginning Tape Five, Side B"

            "answer": "I went back to France, I mean, on the thank you trip to the nuns and to the Ros family and to the Guyaux family and the Rozinsky family. I went to thank them. I made a -- a decision to do it. The Catholic archdiocese of southern California helped me to locate this -- these -- these nuns, this order of -- turned out to be the order where Bernadette was a member, and they utilized the Catholic archives in France and elsewhere. Incidentally, that congregation was th-the congregation of nuns in La Soeur de la Charit\u00e9 [speaks French]. Well, I\u2019m sure nobody will translate that properly. Anyway, they have acknowledged my -- my -- my being hidden by them. They have included me in their -- in their archive. Now, everything I have said, all right, the arrest and -- and detention and death of my father is recorded by the French government. It is recorded by the German government. It 1s attested to by [indecipherable] in his research, including the very shipment that he was in, and his death, ultimate death in -- in Majdanek, by Lublin. The fact that I recited, that I was honored by the Catholic archdiocese to be their poster child, right, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 151 Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 is a recorded event. It was published in their distributed publication called, \u201cThe Tidings\u201d, and this was published in January 2001, because of the second Vatican and because of Pope pi -- Pope Pius -- John Paul th-the -- the -- the second. I have included m-many of the pages of the -- the 1 -- the historical research done by the French historian that I referred to in -- of the Jews of ther -- Lot-et-Garonne, which confirms that what happened to my parents an-and to me. The German state where I was born, not only did acknowledge what happened to us, but they also acknowledge the -- the death of my grandfather, my paternal grandfather and the -- the -- the last of my uncles, where they were sent and they were killed, at Riga. And the memorial is there, they are listed 1-in the deaths of that camp, right, and I was sent all that documentation and th-the -- the efforts that they -- they are -- the city of Kiel is one of the sponsor of that particular monument and maintenance, in perpetuity they told me. As I said, the city of Kiel, at my request created finally, a memorial to the Jews which basically I have to say that all of these efforts, throughout, that what\u2019s happened in Kiel has centered basically on my family, because the museum in Kiel is center -- as I said, of -- of memorial and photos and so forth, which ha-has my -- my cousins, my family in it. So, I have to say that my family is honored. It\u2019s sad to have that as an inheritance, but we don\u2019t feel sorry for ourselves. We move forward, we prevail, all right. We -- we meet the challenges, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 152 Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 and | -- I say that not as as -- matter of speech, but this is a matter of absolute fact. So in what you ask, you know, the question of how did you emotionally, as I understand, I mean, cope with different thing? Well, I'll give you the proof. The proof of the pudding is what is the bottom of the balance sheet, right. What is it that you did with your life? What is it that your brother did? What is it your mother did? Well, Pll tell you what my mother did. She sacrificed everything for her two sons. She worked like hell. Every day she would travel, you understand, by the bus, you know, from Oakland to San Francisco. Every day of her life, right, until she retired. Every day she worked to earn enough money, right, so we could go to school, you know? Not depend on -- on charity, on poverty, or anything, you know. We -- she did it. Now sure, we had a little bit of help from my inheritance, we had a little help that was given to her 1n-in -- in some reparation, you know, by the German government. Some by a pension of France, right, cause they were ab- absolutely guilty of complicity, you know, to the murder of my father. I mean, that\u2019s absolute. I condemn them as total accomplices, okay. The fact that my father\u2019s name is on the memorial of the dead in my town, right, the only Jew that is so honored, you know, 1-1s -- 1s a -- 1s -- 1s a proof of the fact that some French people recognized the enormity of their complicity. But to some degree, we have to understand, you know, they had limited choices. They could only act at the peril of Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about this collection 153 Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 their own life, and they had to depend on everybody else. So, you know, in this whole ballgame, right, who are the only real, real monster? Of course, it\u2019s the German. This educated, right, most advanced culture of all became induced and seduced by these -- these -- these monsters. So they\u2019re all accomplices, they\u2019re all murderers. Under the laws the way we have it in the United States, if you are an accomplice before the fact or after the fact to a murder, you are guilty of murder. They are guilty of murder, period. All of them. That\u2019s it. Now, again, the -- the -- the importance of my statement here is that there is balance. And those who survived, some of them have survived that they can see, still see the evil and the dark of what happened, and yet live a beautiful life, without forgiving, without forgetting. I will never forget the murderers of my father. Never forget the pain and suffering they inflicted on my mother. And it would be a dishonor to me or anybody who lived through what I lived through, not to honor their mother and father, or their relatives, right, for their horrible, horrible death, you know. And that is the legacy. And I ask myself, why was I allowed to live? You know, why was I spared? Well, I believe this is one of the reasons. This collection of work, my testimony here, right. I didn\u2019t give it earlier because I didn\u2019t have all the documents that I wanted, right. Now I have it. Now I give it, and I give my judgments, too. I answer your inquiry, but I\u2019m willing to give it to you in a sense of saying I condemn what should be condemned. 154 Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 Okay, there is one other point that I need to make. The United States of America, to its credit, has learned from the serious, horrible injustices that were done to the Jews of Europe. And in its greatness and kindness and generosity, as was true in the past but not to the Jew, they became very generous to others. And that 1s a credit, because in the United States, after they recognized what they had done wrong or been complicit with, they were among the first, if not the first to recognize the state of Israel. They are, and stood, often alone between 1945 and -- and now -- or \u00b048, to be more correct, and now, to stand and protect Israel, provide them arms and money and -- and support, politi -- many, many, many time the lone country, the lone voice. Many, many time France and England, right, who should have supported, right, Israel, they voted the other way or they remained silent. The United States of America, to its great credit, also grew up and learned. And the fact that we today even consider that a black could be president of the United States, or a woman become president of the United States finally, I think in great part is the lessons that were learned by the United States to the wrongs that they committed to the Jews. So the generosity of this country, and it is a generous country, I think in part, is a debt of repayment to what they didn\u2019t do to the Jews. But that doesn\u2019t diminish my love for this country."
