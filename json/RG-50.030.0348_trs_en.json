            "answer": "We were just two children at home when we grow up. My self, I was the older one, the oldest and my brother who is a few years younger than Iam. My brother is still alive. We come from a very caring family. My father was the sole supporter of the family at this time, and my mother was - He was a textile designer. He managed a textile mill with 300 people. My mother was a housewife. And they're very loving and very devoted to the family, my parents. So, I grew up, they were very charitable, you know, orthodox people but at the same time they were interested what's going on in the world. They read papers, they spoke a few languages, except Yiddish, we spoke at home Yiddish. That's why I know to speak Yiddish very well. Never forgot. Just, you know, middle income people. At the summer, when I was younger, my mother used to go -- the climate is like, winters are very cold in Europe, in this part of Europe, and summers are hot but dry, so she used to go when we were small, she used to go to the country. So, I remember that time in the woods and it was very nice. Later on when I was older and I went to high school, I loved to travel so I just traveled the whole Poland with groups, with students and things like that. Later on I didn't want to go with my mother. So, what else?"

            "answer": "First I went to public school and then they sent me to private, one of the best private schools in town. I'll tell you about the city a little bit, Lodz. Lodz is called the Polish Manchester. That's the city of fabrics. It's just they make fabrics, not, like lining, linen fabrics. Not very expensive fabrics like woolens, there were other cities in Poland. It was mostly, in, maybe one third of the population, about 100,000 at that time, maybe a few years before the war, there were 100,000 Germans living in Lodz. They were mostly professionals working in the textile business. My father was a very reputable man in the community; they used to ask him all the time when people had a dispute, to, according he was learned in, little in the Talmud and they didn't want to go to court, they would ask, I'm talking about Jewish people. They would ask; he, Raul would know what means, \"Beit Din\"(?)[court of Jewish law] --"

He would know, he would understand what means -- to make a judgment, he'd listen to both sides and they will obey for that what, my husband think, he has to be a very respectable person. Sometimes he did that just for no money, just to help out people. He always tried that he get, you know, it was at the times the government in Poland was not anti-semitic, but the people were. See, it's different, and you live with the people, right? So he tried to see that some Jewish people will be employed in the factory; 1t would depend on my father. He tried. Even the owners didn't, they were our family, the name of the factory was Prechegubski(ph.). It was cousins that he worked for. So, we were very comfortable before the war. They sent me to high school, the best high school in town. When you graduated high school you had to take five years Hebrew, five years a foreign language, I took German, five years Latin. So, you can imagine when you graduated school it's like two years college in the United States."

            "answer": "I tell you, this I tell you, we had a really Jewish observant home. All the holidays, all the Saturdays and everything was really observed. When I became a teenager, I belonged to a Zionist organization, the Herzlia. I never did anything that will, most my, my parents didn't know that I belonged to that organization. Because either they were for it that a Jewish state should be established, that we'd have a place to go like we used to have a long time ago. Girls were raised at that time not to have special, that they get independent, that they get a trade to make for the future. Not always stay with parents, stay 20 years with the parents and then you live by yourself and get married and have a family and children. Well, I had different ideas. I wanted to first, I don't know where I got the idea, but I had my idea, I wanted to be independent. Wherever I go and whatever I'm going to be; that was before the war. That I can make a living somehow and not be dependent on anybody else."

Because it was the English mandate, you know. First before were the Turks, then the English came and they didn't let anybody in. People had to smuggle in the boats and things. So, that was it. It was to bring up now like we want to bring up the Jewish youth will remember the Holocaust. At that time, 1t was that the Jewish youth for the future they will come and settle in Palestine, that was Palestine, right, and build a land and politically, that we can, what happened after the war, but had to be a Hitler first, to bring a Jewish state."

            "answer": "Ah, we, we watched that. And in 1933, when Hitler was first legally voted and became the chancellor and he made the -- he burned the Reichstag and the [authors] and the books, so we were very well informed what's going on. We couldn't imagine what a magnitude and what it's going to be. A lot of people who had a lot of money could make plans and go elsewhere. The border's open if you have a lot of money. But if you're middle income people and you have no, you live, maybe you have some savings, you can't just afford to escape, even before the war, some years before you can even plan about this. I remember one incident and that lasts for me forever. I was home by myself and came at the door a vendor. He was a German, and he wanted to sell me something. I didn't have no idea and nothing on my mother wanted it, I said I'm sorry, I just don't need anything, nobody's home and I won't buy anything from you, and thank you. And you know what he told me. He told me I, this with angry and with such a hate, he told me now wait until Hitler will come and you see what happen to you Jews."

I was interested in fashion design and always wanted to paint. I never had time. I was designing clothes and I was taking courses in fashion design. I was very good at it. What other people took in two years, I made in one year. 01:14;30 The teacher that was there she said, there were some students that were with me in the high school, she said, well this one must be an apprentice somewhere. Because how did she know, in Poland at that time you just didn't go to school and learn a trade. You were sitting for a couple of years in a, with a dressmaker, a good one and you learned the trade that way. Didn't get paid anything, beginning. That was apprenticeship. So, she said, she must have been -- and there was one that went to me to school, she said no, no, we just graduated school last year and she never went to, she wasn't apprentice, no place. She couldn't understand; and you know what, I envy that teacher of mine, I remember her name, that I want to be once and do what she does. And that realize, I was teaching the same way she did."

            "answer": "Well then, in 1939 the war came. Lodz was not far from the German border. By September 8, the city of Lodz was occupied without any opposition. There was no -- Warsaw it took them to take, six weeks it took them, until they take that part of Poland, but Lodz they took without a shot. So, the Germans came with a big parade with the tanks and with the airplanes on top, and people, when the day would, people come, there was a, I remember, was like an exodus. People were, whatever they could, they put, you know, bundles and things. Whoever had cars had the car in, had horse with a buggy, whoever buy food; and people try escape the city towards Warsaw. On that road, so many people got killed because the Germans flew over their heads and they were throwing, you know, shooting. And the screaming was, like -- A lot of people never made the destination where they wanted to go. Some wanted to run away to Russia. Russia later on was no picnic either because what they did to one they escaped, they put them to jail, sent them to Siberia. So, and then they came in September. We know the things, but we couldn't imagine what is waiting for us. We just couldn't. Slowly they started to, with the Jewish star, with the thing, and then, by January 1940, they had, they chased all the Jewish population to the ghetto, an old dilapidated section of the town near the Jewish cemetery. There was a round thing with barbed wire and little bridges to pass for people to go out and in, overpasses, and towers, watch towers."

            "question": "Let me just interrupt you a moment because there's a lot I want you to explain about the ghetto, but there were a few months in between and I'm trying to get a sense of what your life was like and what happened to the Jewish people. Were there orders and restrictions, and what was going on in the city before the ghetto was formed in those few months. Was it scary?",
            "answer": "It was very scary and we know that we had no other choice, I mean, I'm talking about my family. We had no other choice, even from my family the young people, cousins like, my mother came from a family of four; they were all were married, so there were cousins about my age, a little younger. So, they escaped. They were, and some, this one, my cousin from my mother's side, just disappeared. We never heard from him anymore. He run away toward Warsaw, what happened to him nobody knows. We couldn't find a person that would know or heard of him or anything. To organizations, nobody could find what happened to him. My mother's youngest brother -- people went to different towns, and they thought maybe they escaped because Lodz was called as the Reich, that means the main thing. The other parts like where David come from, I don't think was the Reich, was just like a next territories. So, here they want to put all the rules that go for their own country, and that was industrial city and they had a lot of support because there was a lot of German population. There was about at least 300,000 Jews in Lodz. It was a very cultural city. All the concerts, Jewish theater, used to come Maurice Schwartz, biggest singers and players. Used to come first to the Philharmonic in Lodz. I used to go. I loved the theater; and it was a very cultural city. Libraries and everything. So, we knew that something dreadful, but we could not imagine in our wildest imagination that something like this would happen."

You know, to lend in a different-- you know you need a passport for that, and you need a passport, well you could buy it, let's, you know how itis. For money you could get everywhere. You could get to the United States. People didn't know; there were people that came back in '39, back when they went for a tourist trip to the United States and they came back, to share our goal, I mean, all the things what happened to the people; because they didn't know what happened, what's going to happen."

We shouldn't be afraid of them, you know, when they marched in. And then they started with the business and the local people started, the Germans they raised their heads. They said not to buy from the Jews. They took away everything what we lived. The population, our neighbors, they took over our homes, our furniture, everything what they had. You could take only what you -- when we went to the ghetto, you could only take with you what you can move. That's all you could take with you."

And everything was special directed against the Jewish population, you understand. So, then we started to wear the star of David. We had to wear it on the left side, on the chest, right here.

They broke the business windows and the glass and they chased all the people out. They just ran out to the boarder. They came to Lodz, and the Jewish community in Lodz took care of them. That I remember and it really hurt me. I knew how to speak German and you walked on the -- that was before the war, after this happened, the crystal night, there came a lot of German people. They considered themselves better than the Polish people. They always said they were more educated, more intelligent, more assimilated; that for sure they were. And they used to say, I tell you in German and then translate: \"in unser Vaterland.\" They used to go on the main thing, it was a beautiful Petegauer Strasse(ph.) in Lodz, beautiful stores, with, you know, like Fifth Avenue in New York, and they used to say, \"Oh, in unser Vaterland!\" They chased them out to where they were and they still said, \"in unser Vaterland,\" that means, in our country; the German, it's their country. So, people were stupid. They all ended up anyway, going to Auschwitz and you know what Auschwitz was. So, I'm just telling you the atmosphere wasn't any good, even before the war; and when the Germans came we knew that the Poles, they could never defend themself and just against, because they had -- they prepared for that, for the annexation of, you know, without one shot."

So, they chose him as the Judendalteste, as the commander and chief, he was responsible for the Jewish people. Chaim Rumkowski. I'm sure you heard that name.

When the shawls were made in the factory, woven, then they had to be given out to people, to women who made some money on the side. And made, the fringes had to be, you know, you get the threads, to cut, and to make it and to put it on on the thing, black fringes. So, the women used to come to him, he'd give them a bundle and they bring it back, and that was his job. And because these people, that did that job lived in that section, so he lived in that section. My mother's, next from my mother's, her brother. So he lived there, so he got for us an apartment. There was a room and a kitchen. I remember that place. He lived on the other side. I remember the address, and it was just on the border; it was Mimanoskigo(ph.) 19. On the top, when you go out on the street, there was the overpass to go out, outside the ghetto. Then we had, our grandfather, my maternal grandfather, grandmother had passed away some time ago. So he, before the war he lived by for himself. Then he lived for a while with us, and when the ghetto came he lived in the same building with the uncle, with us. He had a room for himself. He wasn't so easy, you know, people get older; they're not easy in some bad circumstances. He wasn't so easy. I think by the time we went to the ghetto he passed away; uncle Heinrich Novomurst(ph.). Grandfather -- Then, so, so, my father, from malnutrition my father got sick. He had diabetes and I used to -- he was very well, working and everything, and when I was in high school, it was before the war, I used to make him insulin injections, for my father, in the arm, all the time, everyday. We came in the ghetto, was no, he died away of malnutrition in 1942, in April 1942. So, we have a -- then and there's a place we put a stone, on the cemetery, the old Jewish cemetery in Lodz. And I, I wasn't there, but sometime, my cousins from Israel came there and I know because we got some money through some friends that lived in Poland, not Jewish friends, and they put up a stone, they sent a picture us.

Then you had, they had machines that they cut, and men was mostly employed. 02;07:48 You had to watch them that when it goes, and then they make bundles when it's cut up. For each, let's say, the one that stitches on the machine and then Then the white dress has a front and a back and whatever, and two sleeves and a double collar and cuffs and pockets and whatever it needs for a dress, so in neat bundles; let's say, she got 10 or 12 dresses, so she made.

If you cut in, let's say, in the collar, where you have to have a round, and you cut in straight, you can't use that part ever, so you need more fabric. So, the Germans come and say hey, you need more fabric. What's the matter? You doing sabotage? So, it was like you had to use a lot of diplomacy. I was young then. That was a matter of survival. Because I worked there, I got a little better ration than other people. It was a responsible job. I work at that factory all the ttme. Then they changed. They stopped the, later, when they stopped the dresses, they gave me another job in the same factory. They started working on women's bras and intimate things, the pieces. So, I was then.

We used to buy potatoes peels, wash them, scrub them that they should be sandy and grind them and make potato pancakes, Latkes(ph.). That was -- and we got some oil, it was a ration, if you want this oil for a month or whatever, and so we used that, and kollrabi, that was the vegetable that you get.

You go there and you know one who knows this, and this, and you go there and could buy eggs. You could buy a chicken, but you need the money. Then the health conditions were very, very bad. Sanitation was bad. Old people were dying. There was no medication. There were very few doctors. Life was hopeless. Sanitation was terrible. There was no sewage, so they had to, you know, cesspools, so all the time they haul wagons to clean, the thing would run all day to the city back and forth and then something else. Those little wagons that they picked up the dead people every day, how many people died in the ghetto every day. From malnutrition, from disease, and people got sick, there was no hope. If you got sick and you work and you didn't come to work, then that was the worst thing. I learned this in the ghetto. If you get sick and you don't come to work, in a few days they come after you to find out why. The deportation was the worst thing. At the beginning, people who wanted, thought that they go in, the German said that they sending the people to labor camp. They're going to work. They're going to be fed better, better conditions, better living conditions, so a lot of people, men, young people, volunteered, and they wanted to go. Never heard anybody came back, never, until, first we knew what happened to these people is, see the Germans kept everything secret. They tried to, everything to be hidden. In 1942, somebody escaped from Chelmno. You know, when they shoot, what they did with the people before they had the, how you call it, the crematoria, is, they took the men and they told them to dig, like graves, but one big grave. When we dug the grave, they, when they were ready, they figure out, it's enough for a pile for that many people, they start the thing, and they say, face in and they shoot from the back and the bodies fell in and they pile up and that was the end. So, one guy was shot, but he wasn't shot dead. So, he crawled out from that after they left and somebody helped him out, and he came back to the ghetto, and he told the story. So, then he knew that they're building a crematoria and they going be much faster. That all, they mostly think, that they selected people that able bodies go to work, and women with children and invalids, everything goes; they liquidate. That was called the final solution. So, in 1942, so the whole ghetto was very panicky, after this, because they never knew. First, they gave that Judenalteste, Chaim Rumkowski, they gave him like an order that they need 500 able bodies. So, he had to select. His friends and his acquaintances he wouldn't select, so he took people just at random, whoever bad luck was, you went. And people didn't want to go, so there was a, they opposed him, and then it came to a point in the ghetto that people just didn't want to go voluntarily, so he went to the Germans and he told them, that he can't deliver because people didn't want to go. So, they made their way that they're going take themselves. Sometimes they came with dogs and people couldn't go out from the homes. They came, you know, those big dogs, and they smell out people and if there was a person inside hidden the dog will start barking and they will break the door and find that person and drag them down and they will shot it in front of everybody.

I tell you, we had so much tzures, you know, troubles, our own, health, nutrition, family, that besides that what happening with our neighbors, our immediate family, that wasn't even the will to participate in anything, all the time. In the evening we wouldn't go out, no place. At day time, I work. Then I had my mother. In six months my mother, you know I lost my mother she was only 48 years old, and my father died at 54. That's the hardest story to tell. Once there were, the German came and they made, that was in 1942, was six months after, about five six months after my father passed away. It was about August, September at the time of the Jewish holidays, and the German came and they want a transport. At that time Rumkowski could not make it, so he said to the German, you come in the ghetto and do it. So, they came. You know how brutal they were. So, they came and they ordered everybody \"Raus!,\" out, from the houses. At that time, my mother was my responsibility. In six months she became -- her hair became white, grey. She was a young woman, after she lost her husband. So, my brother worked as a counselor and at least he had better food than we had, the two that were still there. So, he worked with the orphans there. So, I didn't see him, it was maybe ten miles away. So, how could I see him. No telephone, nothing. It was like I was one, alone, and my mother was my responsibility. So, I figured do I go down or not go down. Then people said, if you don't go out, on the streets, they'll come with dogs and it's going to be even worse. So, I went down, and from my side, they took away my mother. They grabbed her, and I couldn't do anything, I wanted to go with her. That was the last time I saw my mother. I knew the place where they had the gathering place of all the people that they took, so at night, and the next day they took just a few days until they organized and they have wagons on the side, a train to put them in, to a different -- But from Lodz, the first time they put people to Chelmno, it was in the woods and they made this thing that I told you. I think they had the first chimneys over there. Tape 2 ",
                " I left at that point, that next day they took my mother, I got a note from her, somebody came from there and brought me her wedding band and a note; and so I felt that I want to see her. So, it came to evening. I got dressed, dark. I took my ration of bread, and when it came dusk, I went out in the direction where that building was where the people were gathered. It was like between, you still could see but it was, the night was coming in. And far of the thing -- It was just across to go a big field. Like from here, over there, to the, you know, twice the golf course. And you could see, on top you could see the light from the guard, on the tower. I was a distance, when I came close, and I crawled, just like this, like this on the ground. All of the sudden, from the direction where the tower was, they start shooting at me. So I stopped, then, when they stopped, I crawl closer, then they start shooting again more. So, I stopped and I was thinking, the instinct of survival in a human being, in anything that's alive, is so strong, that you think, what I'm going to achieve, if I'm going go and they going shoot me and I'm not going to see my mother anyway. I should go back. So, while I thought, the light came in, and I start crawling a little more and they start shooting after me, I change my direction, then I figure out that I'll never make it and I went back to the house. You know what? My mother's ring I still have, how I have it, I don't know. It's just a puzzle to me, because you couldn't have a photograph, you couldn't have anything that you own, except your body. If you remain alive, nothing. From one place to the other. So, I had really no idea how I got that ring. Sometimes I think about it and I don't know; have no idea. That haunts me. See, with my father I could make peace. He died, natural death. The war was the villain, malnutrition. But with my mother, I can't make peace. I could never tell this story. When my first grandchild was born, my daughter-in-law sent me a book, a grandchild book, to write down my background, my, everything. When I came to the war, to that point in life, I just stopped and I never put any word, and I couldn't. And they couldn't understand why. They said, what's the matter, are you guilty about that your mother is not alive, that she was taken away. I just couldn't put this on paper. So, you can understand why. It's 52 years, 1942. My kids say, mother you are strong [knot/not], hard. O.k., let's go. So, when I lost my mother, I just didn't want to live anymore in this house. I didn't. What happened? One day, that was before that, I came to class, there were no children. The children went to heaven. We knew that's going to happen. The same thing happen with the orphanage, with my brother's orphanage where he worked, so he came back home. So, he lived with me until the ghetto was destroyed, unil, maybe 1942. Yes, we lived about two years together. So, we changed the address, we moved to a different place. One time, I don't remember that, I remember I was sick, I was once so sick that they didn't think I would survive. I had very high temperature, so high that they just didn't know what to do with me. I was home because I would never go to a hospital, because if you go to a hospital, you never, they take you out from the hospital and they finish you off. They don't want people to get well. They want to get sick and they get rid of them. That was the best solution. Alright, so, but I recovered, so, obviously, I had some years to live. Then I was still working, then I was working in the same factory, but on a different job because they took away that, so. I was responsible for the final product. I inspected the product, that it's one hundred percent o.k., each piece. That was, I had the title, like I'm the instructress; all the time I had that title. So, I told you, so I got a little better ration, something a little more. But it wasn't much, anyway. "

            "answer": "Yes. People got very desperate. We lost so many people, families. I lost, my father had a sister, another sister, they, I don't know what happened to them. They went on a transport, and they're gone, little children. My mother, one cousin, my mother's brother, one died, the one that had this business I told you, where we lived, they have five kids. So, the oldest went, escaped when the German came and we never heard of him. The rest of the children, I think, he sent with the younger, his younger brother, to another town. The younger brother had two boys, and they moved out from, they moved, I think there was a Polish city, Czestochowa. They went there. I mean, we had no communication with them, we don't know. We couldn't write letters. There was no telephone. There wasn't any communication. And anyway, I think they were some, they were hiding out, and some Polish people tried to, I think, help them out. Anyway, they didn't survive either. One boy survived, the older one. After the war, by accident I met him. I just want to tell you this. He was tall, he was 18 or 17 years old when I met him. And I came in the place, that was after the liberation, we were in Landsberg, and I went into a place that woman sells some stuff, a private house, fabrics or whatever she sells, or food, I don't know what. Anyway, I went over there and I know the woman and that was a young man in a uniform, very young and handsome and I looked at him and I looked at him and I walked at him and I said, are you Kubanawonya(ph.), that was my cousin, my uncle's son, the one that I said the one. He looks at me, he says, how do you know my name? I said, you're my cousin, and I told him who I was. I hadn't seen him maybe the whole time of the war, he grew up, but there was something that I recognize him. Well, he went to Israel, to Palestine. He told me that he goes on the Aliyah Bet, and in 1948 he was killed in the Negev, in the war of liberation. So,"

Then they shaved off our hair. We came out from the shower, we didn't recognize each other. You know, how a woman looks when she has no hair any more. Can't recognize, I didn't recognize my friends, that I went together with them to school. I never see them anymore after this. Until today, I don't know what happened to them. We were very good friends, went the same transport. So, somehow when it came water, there was a scream. That's not the end yet. We're going to live. So, when we came out, we had to pick at random some piece of clothing from the pile. You got another, or it fit you or didn't fit you it didn't matter, from a different pile, something for the feet, wooden shoes or whatever, and then you went to the barracks. Those barracks, I was only about ten days or two weeks in Auschwitz, but that was the worst part that anyplace that I was. They were so merciless that people that could survive Auschwitz must have been some, must have been, had some, they had to do something, have some function, that they survived in Auschwitz. Because that was the worst place that you can, just the psychology of that. We were up all night and talking and what was going on, how people were sick and the sick and the able bodies and the sick one were in the same one, the place was huge. The kapos were there, women kapos and they were commandeering and showing their power, what they can do, what to obey, and how they, the rules, and they were so rude. Just our own fate! It was just unbelievable; and I figure out, if I have to stay, and I just prayed that they send me as soon as possible to a labor camp; that we're going to work. You know people got in Auschwitz, Auschwitz was surrounded by an electric fence. Some people got so mad in their mind that they run to the fence. They want to run away, and they got killed, electrocuted."

You can't think because this is a death place. They said, this is a dead place. Nobody goes out here alive, even if you weren't gassed out. They tell you this. They told us, the one that were a long time there. And they worked there on different, very unpleasant missions, they work. The other people. We weren't assigned, see I have no number, and the folks that were with me had no numbers. They were in a hurry, the Germans, that time, and they didn't make any numbers, because all the forces came closing in and in and in. The Russians came closer and closer, so they wanted the most what they wanted, get rid of us, the most of they could. And the one that were capable to work, they sent to work.

So, they told us that we're going to be sent away, with a transport to work. So, one day it came that they sent us to, that was not far from a industrial city of Essen, Essen in Solingen. That's famous for steel work, so they worked at that time of the war, they built airplanes there. And I worked, Framo-Werke was called, the shop we work. I was a welder in the camp. I was working with the mask and with fire, in a tub like in my bathroom, but the top was open and the bottom was open, because the \"Halle\" was very big, the hall, and there were all kinds of different machines. The big women worked on \"Bohrers,\" [drills] that made hole in iron. We worked on the, we made Anti-Luftwaffen, to shoot down airplanes, the V-2 was called. So, I was welding big pieces, huge pieces. They used to come, they had Russian and French prisoners of war over there, at camp, so they used to come and bring, so they worked, they had a different camp. Maybe they were treated better than we were, because prisoners of war, that is, but the Germans didn't care very much about the Geneva convention, that they should be treated like human beings. But maybe they were treated a little better than us. So, they used to bring parts to be welded. So that fire shouldn't disturb the order, I had a cabin. There were just three women for the whole thing. There was three of us that were welders. God forbid if I burn something. How do I know to weld? Do I know to weld? I had no idea, I never did this kind of work. They gave me a torch. They showed you how to do, don't press too much because if you put too much fire, too hot, then the whole iron burns, and you can't do nothing with it. You had to just join it together and not to burn, so I tried. And we did, like big cannons, big cannons I was welding, the rings on the cannon, so they are not welded round. They welded like round, they welded a piece then a piece, space, then another and another, in pieces, and it lies on a row and the man that came, would turn it. That could be turned, that, each time on a different place. Because, they explain, if you weld around, that piece is not strong enough, you have to be weld in parts, round and round."

Because she always wanted, she said she's sick, she said she couldn't work, young woman, my age, and she said, I'm sick, I can't work, I go to the \"Krankenstube,\" the sickroom. I said, Anne, if you go, and in Polish they call it Hanka, Anne is Hanka, if you don't go to work, you know, in a few days what happens to you - this happened, you see, I gave her an example, this happened to somebody else; this way you have a chance to survive and see your family. I think she was married. And see your husband maybe. Go, we are going to protect you, cause we all working, it's going to be that you work too. Just go. She can't. She went; because, if she would go to the \"Krankenstube\" -- She met me after the war, she lives now in Chicago, I hope she's still alive, and I met her in Landsberg am Lech. She came to me and she said, you know, I thank you that I'm alive; she knew that. I did a few times risk my life by trying to find out how far the war was. We know at that time, where was the San Francisco meeting in January '45. You know in San Francisco they met for the, to put, in the United Nations, that help to settle the war. You know about that meeting, so we know, I'll tell you how it worked. At one spot from the big barracks, that a hole, was tremendous big hole; in the walks between, there was, at the end was a room where they had their office and the SS women they slept there, all night. They had a radio, and we could understand German, so the one that slept closest, would listen. They made believe they went to sleep, by time they were supposed to and then they listen and they knew things. Then was another source, the people there would come sometimes to me, and to other people and they bring things to do a part for you for them. You tried to communicate with them. Well, I don't speak French. I can speak Polish. I understand Czech. So if was a Czech, there came different, they were prisoners of war. They or, they bring a piece of newspaper, we could read. They knew that we wanted, survival, is, if you have hope, you be able to survive. So, they tried to help. Once I had, I had a very close, very close thing. The woman, that she stood by my, when I had somebody inside, and I was welding inside, she would stay by the door and, obviously, and watch. I didn't know that. So, once, I think I had a French guy, or, and I tried to communicate with him, he should tell me something, or explain how the war was. Anyway, when he finished, she called me out, and she slapped me over the face. She was a husky, strong women with the SS, you know, the black band, SS, there were those zig-zag star. And she said, in German, she knew that I understand, and she said, you spoke with the guy and she hit me over the face, that I saw stars; boy, that I didn't [fell down]. And she said, like this, and the whole place where they were working was so quiet, like a pin it would drop, the machines stopped and everything. And she said, when you come home I'll report you to the Oberscharftthrer. That's the commander of the German commander of the camp. Well, when you get reported to the Oberscharfthrer, give you such a beating that you have to go to the sickroom. When you go to the sick room, you don't go to work, forget about life. O.k., so, look, it was nothing that you could do. I just shook myself off and I just told her, that I don't speak his language, how do I could communicate with him? That I told her in German; it wasn't, and it's no use. Alright. Now, how I survived, I tell you, after I was told, all the women that knew me, they, in their heart they pray that she should forget, they shouldn't remember to, to report me to the Oberscharfuhrer. When we came home, we start counting and counting, that was in the evening, and counting, how many, and first we missed two, then we missed three, and we were standing maybe, maybe three quarters of an hour or an hour. She forgot to report me. And that was, that story I called the power of prayer. They told me later that, that they all prayed that I, that they shouldn't remember, she should forget to report me, that what happened."

She was runned over by, by the tank. That was the first thing, with the first Russian thing, so that was one. And then, when the Russian came, they spoke, I could understand what they talk to us, they used to say, well we liberated you, we did liberate you, they said in Russian, and you don't want to love us, so we knew it's going to come for us, so it came at night; we used to barricade all the doors and windows; all the furniture, there were benches over there, and chairs, you know, the furniture heavy, like oak, heavy oak furniture was the, so we put it against, and we didn't go to sleep first, until the barricade was up the ceiling, that they couldn't open the door.

Of course, to begin the captain, the one that run the Russians, he didn't know about that; so the first few days we had to, with the food was, who was stronger would run three times for the soup, and the one, of --. So many people were, looked like, we called them \"Muselmanns,\" just skeletons, nothing, flesh and bone, you know, nothing left. So, they didn't have the strength even run for the soup. They couldn't get the soup because the stronger one ran before them and it was finished, with the kettle soup. So people got sick, after the liberation, people died. You know, that they died, first of all, they brought, they didn't know how to feed people like us. They brought sacks of sugar. They distribute the sugar. If you give people on a hungry, on a empty stomach sugar, from sugar you get diarrhea. And you get diarrhea when people are so, you know, there is nothing left, they die. No medication for it, or anything. People die from the diarrhea. You know, dehydration. So, people died from diarrhea. Then it came, no hygenic, no sanitation, no things, so it came, typhus. You know that 5,000 people after the liberation died on typhus, in Theresienstadt, 5,000 people! So, then it came to the commander, the Russian commander, and he was the boss, he was a nice man, he understood the situation, and he told them, he said that these soldiers, they're going to do things like that. They gone, if the woman doesn't want to go with them, they going to be very severe punished. So, at least, if the commander knew, we were, we had a little security. And then they, but it took time to organize that everything, and organized that everybody would get food. So, that's what I wrote in my story, that the war didn't end for us. No way."

No home, no parents, no family, where to go? What was the, what's the destiny? Where do I go. So, you had to get settled in some way, your mind. That, you had to organize somehow your life, and this is not so simple, after so many years, that somebody told you what to do, not that you could do what you want to do. That's difficult. So, first I think, sometimes, yes, then I find out that, then we start looking for, 1f somebody's alive from the family, so I start looking for.

When I lived in New York, and I worked at FIT, the Fashion Institute of Technology, I had access to go on, on 7th Avenue. That's called the Fashion Avenue. There's a lot of places that you can go, that designers can go and get some fabrics, discount fabrics, they have remnants, beautiful pieces. So, I, I, they know me at this, some place on the 8th, 7th floor, some place, different places. O.k., I went to such a place once, and there was two women, an older one and a younger, look like a mother and daughter, and they look for things and I look my things. There's just, not a lot of customers, just some people. So, all of a sudden, this woman, the mother, comes over to me, and she tells me my maiden name. I look at her, no, doesn't register anything, I don't know. So, she said, how do I know my maiden name? She said, well, you were my teacher, in Bergen- Belsen. You taught me dress making. And this is my daughter and we live in Israel, and that helped me make a living. I got married. I have a family and I help them."

That's what I had - a daughter and a son, that's all. So, we went to school and went to school, and I was just keeping house and watching the children and raising the kids. When the kids start growing up, we lived in a section where the school, we didn't like the school. So, we figure out, when the chil-, when my daughter is going to be five years old, we have to move from that neighborhood. We did, we made an effort, and we moved the neighborhood that she be able to go to a different school, public school. So we did, we moved from - that was in Brooklyn, we moved to Astoria, that's Long Island. I mean, it was, the school was a nice school, an old school, a public school.

So, that's very important; and life goes on. You learn to live, you don't live just for yourself. You live for other people. You try to help other people, you give charity, the way my parents used to; whatever you took from home, that's you take for life, for you. My little -- my daughter's daughter, she said like this and I have to tell you this, and on this I'm going to end, she said like this in school, she goes to a private school in Santa Monica, so there was a question, what your grandmother mean to you, so she, and she's nine years old, so she answered like this; to think that I went from my mother, my mother went from her mother, from my grandmother, and that's the, all things that she had teaching me, she know from her mother. And that was, it is true, because she knows sewing, she knows embroidery, she knows paint, 5 everything. That little one can do everything, the little one.

So, I, I thought don't, in the ten commandments, and you think that you should never do something to other people that you don't like others will do to you. And that's what kept me, the morals that my parents gave me, you understand, that they gave me, that kept me and that I could survive. You follow this? 6 Yes, I think that's the spirit of that, so, I never wanted to do any harm to anybody, and if I would steal, God forbid, steal a piece of bread or do something wrong to anybody, I wouldn't like that somebody do this to me, because it's a matter of dead and life. If I steal you bread, I steal away your life. Like other people did, but, they come from good homes, but they couldn't, they, they just couldn't help. We condemn them, and there was a very sad story, in the camp. I told you, the one girl that stole the bread from her neighbor, now, until we find her, she would, she did this in the middle of the night."
