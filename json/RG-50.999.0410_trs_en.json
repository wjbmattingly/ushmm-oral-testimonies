My name is Bill Benson, | am the host of the museum's public\nprogram, First Person. We just began our 14th year of First Person last week. Our First Person\ntoday is Mrs. Halina Peabody, whom we shall meet shortly.\nThis 2013 season of First Person is made possible through the generosity of the Louis Franklin\nSmith Foundation, to whom we are grateful for again sponsoring First Person.\nFirst Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share with\nus their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each guest serves as a\nvolunteer here at this museum. Our program will continue until mid August. The museum's website,\nat www.ushmm.org, provides information about each of our upcoming First Person guests.\nHalina Peabody will share with us her First Person account of her experience during the\nHolocaust and as a survivor for about 40 minutes. If time allows towards the end of our program,\nwe'll have an opportunity for you to ask her a few questions.\nThe life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about to hear\nfrom Halina is one individual's account of the Holocaust.\nWe have prepared a brief slide presentation to help with her introduction.\nHalina Litman was born in Krakow, Poland, December 12, 1932. Poland is to the right of\nGermany on this map of Europe. The arrow on this map of Poland shows the location of Krakow.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ;\nHalina was the daughter of Ignacy and Olga Litman.\nIn this photograph, we see Halina, with her mother and her Aunt Irka taken in 1938.\nHalina, her mother and sister survived the war in Jaroslav under false papers identifying the\nfamily as Catholics. On the way to Jaroslav, the family encounted a Polish man, who threatened to\nreveal their identity. Halina's mother struck a bargain with this man of using their tickets for the\nluggage, all the money she had and coats they were wearing, in trade for their survival.\nHere we see Halina, her mother and her baby sister Eva.\nThis is the house where Halina and her family stayed in Jaroslav. In this photograph, Halina\nand her sister Eva celebrate Christmas in hiding.\nHalina's mother decided the safest place to hide was in plain sight. She found a job ata\nGerman headquarters peeling potatoes for German troops. This is a photograph of Halina's mother\nwith two Polish coworkers at the German headquarters where Olga worked. After the war, Halina\nand her family immigrated to England. Halina lives in Bethesda, Maryland. Her husband, Richard,\npassed away in 2011. She has two sons, one who lives in England, and the other just 10 minutes\naway. Halina has two granddaughters, Hannah, who is 16, and Olivia, 9. Hannah, who is producing\na film about her grandmother for a school project is here today. If you don't mind, a little hand wave.\nThank you.\nHannah frequently travels to England to see her son and her sister and her family. In April\n2011, Halina and some of the other survivors from her hometown of Zaleszczyki in Poland, which is\nnow in the Ukraine, went there to place a monument on an unmarked grave in which 800 Jews were\nburied during the first German action in that town. We will hear more about that a little later.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nShe continues her keen interest in sports, which have been a particular importance in her life,\nbecause her mother was the Polish swimming champion in 1925. Later this year, Halina will travel to\nPoland to visit an exhibit of Jewish athletes in Krakow. The exhibit includes her mother. She will\nalso visit her family in England and Israel. Halina speaks frequently about her experience during the\nHolocaust at schools and here at the museum, as well as in other settings. Next week, she travels\nto Racine, Wisconsin, where she will speak at a community Holocaust Days of Remembrance\nsponsored by the Racine Public Library. Last month, she spoke at a high school as part of a\nHolocaust education program of Montgomery College in Maryland. Other upcoming talks include a\nschool in Maclean, Virginia, and a home for the elderly in Maryland.\nShe will also participate in next month's Holocaust commemoration at Har Shalom Synagogue\nin Potomac, Maryland, where she will light one of six candles accompanied by her family. With that,\n| would like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Mrs. Halina Peabody.\n[Applause]\nWelcome, Halina, and thank you so much for being willing to be with us today and be our First\nPerson. We have so much to cover in such a short period, we should begin right away, | think.\n>> Halina Peabody: Absolutely.\n>> Bill Benson: You told me \"Your life was beautiful\" in the early years\nbefore war broke out in Poland in 1939. Let's start our conversation with you\ntelling us a bit about your community, your family and yourself and those\nyears before the war actually began.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\n>> Halina Peabody: | was very young, not quite 7 when the war broke out.\nMy memory is rather childhood. | was the first child of my parents. | was the\nprincess, so to speak. | had every bicycle and tricycle, and my mother was\nvery all-around sports woman. | was skating freely at 5. | remember that.\nShe was always teaching the girls there, the little children there to swim. We\nhad a nice house. My father was a dentist. He had his surgery in the front of\nthe house, and my mother tended to me and the little garden.\nWe had beautiful weather there. Zaleszczyki is in the easternmost\npart of Poland. Not anymore, but it used to be, and the river Dniester which\nis near Romania. You could go in a kayak, halfway through, but there were\nbuoys there, and you couldn't go any further. But you could get a day pass to\nRomania and go over. It was very close, the relations were good. It was a\nvery friendly frontier.\n| had no worries. My father insisted on teaching me to read before |\nwas going to school, because | was supposed to be a genius.\n[Laughter]\nBut it stood me in good stead later on.\n>> Bill Benson: Besides teaching you to read at 5, your parents taught you\nmany other skills.\n>> Halina Peabody: My mother was a wonderful knitter. She taught me to\nknit, crochet, embroider. She used to knit for my Shirley Temple doll.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\n>> Bill Benson: Tell us a bit more about your mother's athletic experience.\n>> Halina Peabody: Well, my mother was a natural. When she started\nswimming, she immediately passed everybody else, even though she wasn't\neven swimming well. She very quickly became part of the team. Very early\non, in her early teenage years she won the Polish championship. She broke\nrecords. She used to show me the statuette of gold she had for the\nchampionship, the four-leaf clover that we had, all gone, but she was\nwonderful. When she left Zaleszczyki, even though we were from Krakow,\nbecause there was water there, she could water ski there, and we'd go on the\nkayak. | had a little paddle, just for me. A wonderful, wonderful life up to that\npoint, up to 1939.\n>> Bill Benson: Of course, it all would change then. September 1939\nGermany invaded Poland from the west. The Soviets then invaded Poland\nfrom the east. You lived in the part of Poland that fell under the Russian\noccupation.\n>> Halina Peabody: Yes. What happened was, we knew the Russians were\ncoming. What | -- | don't remember exactly what | knew, but the people were\nvery great panic, they were running around. A lot of men decided they didn't\nwant to be conscripted. That's what the Russians did, they used to conscript\nthe men into the Russian army, and you were 20 years in this kind of prison.\nYou couldn't leave.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nSo a lot of men -- also they thought about World War | where they did\nthat to the men. They didn't think of women and children being in any\ndanger. | didn't mention that my sister was born two months before the war.\nSo there was a baby in the house.\nMy father decided he should run over to Romania with some others,\nand they just went over the bridge to Romania. A lot of people with him did.\nUnfortunately, then, the Russians came in, and they did a lot of bad\nthings, as | understand it. The people, however, that went over decided after\na while that things have settled down, and perhaps it would be OK to come\nback to the families and the businesses that they left.\nSo they decided to quietly cross back over. By then, the river was\ncompletely frozen over. Took a white sheet, they tried to cross quietly back.\nUnfortunately, the Russians by then sealed the border. They were all\narrested.\nThey were tried for being spies, because they went over and came\nback. My father ended up in a prison, then was sent to Siberia, to a place --\nwe as the family of a criminal, quote unquote, were supposed to go to\nRussia. As | said, the criminals and families were also sent to Siberia. For\nsome reason, that | still don't know what it was, they didn't take us. We were\nall ready to go. However, they threw us out of our house, because we were\nnot allowed to have a house.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\n| Know we moved to a little place called time-out, with a town -- called\nTouste up the road. We had to leave. We had a little room, | remember.\nThat picture is the only picture of my sister as a little child, that my mother\nwas there. That was in the winter. That's where we were, until very shortly\nafterwards, the Germans decided that --\n>> Bill Benson: Let me ask you a couple questions before we go there.\nWhen your father was then sent to Siberia, arrested and sent to Siberia, did\nyour mother know what had happened to him? Did she hear from him in any\nway?\n>> Halina Peabody: We didn't hear for quite a while. He was completely\nincommunicado for a while. Then we got a letter that he was in the gulag\nthere. Before the Germans took over, we had a few letters back and forth.\n>> Bill Benson: Once the Germans took over, that was the end of that?\n>> Halina Peabody: The communication was over.\n>> Bill Benson: Were any other relatives sent to Siberia?\n>> Halina Peabody: Yes, my aunt, uncle and cousin. The other aunt and\nuncle, who were supposed to be taken as well, they for some reason left and\nthey ended up in Auschwitz.\n>> Bill Benson: They weren't taken by the Russians?\n>> Halina Peabody: They were not, later on.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\n>> Bill Benson: You were about 8 1/2 when the Nazis turned on the\nRussians, and the Germans came into the area of Poland where you were.\n>> Halina Peabody: And we came back to our house then.\n>> Bill Benson: Of course, then things turned dramatically worse. Tell us\nwhat happened.\n>> Halina Peabody: Well, when the Germans came, we came back to our\nhouse, when the Germans occupied the rest of Poland they put all kinds of\nrules. Everybody was very anxious to cooperate. We were very, very\nterrified. This was another occupation, not knowing what they expected from\nus. As the Russians did, they demanded gold, silver, anything of value we\nhad to give in.\nThey had everybody working for them. Every Jewish person had to be\nworking for them, to the point where if there was no particular job for them,\nthey made them clean the roads.\nA lot of times they would take groups of young people to work in the\nfield. They would just ask for the number of so-and-so, they would take them\nand come back.\nThey created -- excuse me. They created Judenrat. Judenrat was a\nJewish committee. They took the leaders of the Jewish community of the\ntown and they worked through them. So if they had demands for whatever\nthey had demands, they would ask through the committee, and the\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,\ncommittee was told to supply whatever was necessary.\nAs | said, we went back to our house, so my mother tried to look after\nmy sister as best she could, and me. Kept my writing up. Then they knew\nshe was a good knitter, so they had her knit for the mayor of town. Of\ncourse, a German man who had lots of children. Her job was to knit for the\nmayor's children.\nEverybody, as | said, was very cooperative. They, of course, put\nyellow stars on the houses, yellow bands on our hands. No school for\nJewish children. As | said, we just sat there and tried to do whatever we\ncould. Very, very scared, not knowing, not knowing what. There was\nnowhere to run. We just waited to see what would happen next. We hoped\njust by cooperating things wouldn't be too bad. Everybody was willing to do\nwhat was necessary.\nWe waited always for the people, went to work, came back. Then the\nSS came in, all in black uniforms and gold buttons, very, very scary, came\nroaring down the road on bicycles --\n>> Bill Benson: Motorcycles?\n>> Halina Peabody: Motorcycles, yes. Great noise. We just stayed quiet,\ndidn't know what else was coming.\nWhat they did was instill a lot of fear in us. We were absolutely\nterrified. They start doing things like catching Jewish people that had beards,\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nand that was their religions part of their -- religious part, the religious people\nhad lots of beards. They would catch a person in the street. There were lots\nof screams, yells. They would tear off their hair and do things like that. |\nremember one time | was standing in front of my house, and my mother\npulled me away. Those are the kind of images that | remembered.\n>> Bill Benson: You shared with me an incident that took place pretty quickly\nwhere a large group of young men and women were rounded up. Tell us\nabout that.\n>> Halina Peabody: Yeah. Well, at this point they had this demand for a big\ngroup of young people. They said they wanted as many as they could to\ncome to the square where they would gather, and they would walk up the\nroad. There was an old Polish military camp. The winters were very, very\nfierce there. Very, very severe. Sometimes for the winter they would wrap\nup the trunks of the trees with burlap. That's what they said that they needed\nto have done, because they were up there in the military camp and there was\nnobody there, but they needed to wrap those trees.\nSo a lot of people came, over the number apparently even requested.\nEverybody wanted to help. A lot of volunteers. They all came.\nThey were marched up the road, and we waited for them to come\nback in the evening. And nobody was coming back. So people were getting\na little nervous. Waited and waited. Family members, nothing.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nEventually, towards the evening, one man dragged himself in and\nback to his family, and he told us what happened. What he said was that\nwhen they got there, there was a grave, a communal grave. There were\nplanks of wood over the grave, and they were told to take off the clothes and\nlay down on the planks, and they were shot. As they were shot, they\ndropped into the grave.\nHe was the last one to be done. He was one of the last group that\nwas shot, and he -- apparently they missed his heart, they just hit his arm,\nand they didn't cover them very much with the earth, because there was no\nneed to. A little bit over the top. He managed to drag himself out, and he\ncame home, and that's what he reported.\nWe then understood what happened. Over 800 people. As |\nmentioned to Bill, we always were aware of this horrific memory, that |\nthought there was not a sign of but this grave. We were back in Zaleszczyki,\nand they didn't know about it even.\nThrough the museums, | tracked down a few people from this\nhometown of mine. As | said, | didn't remember any names, but | saw two\nsisters from Zaleszczyki, and | managed to track them down. There was\nquite -- it was about five, six of us apparently in New York, in Montreal.\nWe got together. We got a monument. This lady who lives in\nMontreal went back there and she arranged with the town to put the\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nmonument on it. We traveled April 2011 and put a monument. We had a\ncantor there, and we prayed, prayed for them. That was one of my goals that\n| wanted to put some kind of a memory mark there. So that was the first time\nwe heard about this, what happened to people when they took them away.\nThen we settled back, we wanted to know what the next thing is going\nto be, the next shoe to drop. Not very soon afterwards, they again -- this time\nthe demand was for a number of people. They had exact numbers. Because\nthey were going to take them for work in Germany.\nOf course, by then, everybody was running and trying to hide. My\nmother took my sister and me over, | know, to a lady that used to cook for us,\nacross the street, and we were going to stay with her for the day. And we\nwaited there all day.\nThey had an easy job, because all of the houses were marked with\nyellow stars, they knew where to find them. They got the right number. They\nloaded them on the train, supposedly for work in Germany. Never heard\nfrom them again, either.\nAs we went back, we realized that it was really a situation that was\nhorrendous. My mother with the two children, nowhere to run.\nWe wanted to know what is going to be next. What they did next, they\ndidn't want to have the trouble to look for people and to drag them out of the\nhouses, because after they had those two actions, there were not that many\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,\nJews left. So they threw us out of the town altogether to the same place that\nwe were during the Russians, Touste. They also brought people from the\ncommunities around that did the same thing. Whatever was left, they put us\ntogether again into Touste.\nThere, everybody first, what they wanted to do was look for hiding\nplaces, because we knew the next step would be, again, they were going to\ntry to get us out.\nSo | know my mother said to me there's not much point in doing that,\nbecause as soon as they get us into a smaller group, they'll move us again.\nSo we will lose. This is a no-win situation.\nShe was trying desperately to have at least the children taken over to\nRomania, all sorts of things, but nothing worked.\n>> Bill Benson: She put in motion a plan at one point --\n>> Halina Peabody: Not at this point. She tried to get us over --\n>> Bill Benson: That's what | mean. Apart from her?\n>> Halina Peabody: That's right, without her. Yes. | didn't want to go.\nAnyway, at this point the man came again for a group of people to be in the\nsquare to go for work in Germany, and at this point you see my mother,\nbecause she had some connections there, she knew two farmers. She\ndecided to hide with the farmers.\nA lot of people went underneath the houses. A lot of people had little\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nhiding places marked for them. So everybody went into hiding.\n| was placed with a farmer up in the loft. | was left there. My mother\nmade a deal with another farmer and took my sister. She was going to stay\nwith that farmer for the day. As the day went on, the lady that had me kept\ncoming back and telling me that this one was seen in the square, that one\nwas seen in the square. | was convinced my mother was caught. All day\nlong | thought my God, my mother was caught.\nToward the end of the day finally, she came with my sister and told me\nwhat happened with her, which was that her farmer was scared. In the\nmiddle of the day she got scared, because it was a high penalty for keeping\nJewish people. And she threw her out. She just threw her out with my sister\ninto an empty field.\nNow, that empty field was flat, and it had just a little bush there, she\ntold me. She was hiding under this little bush with my sister. She was\ncrouching there for the rest of the day. She said how they didn't see her is a\nmiracle, because they were circling with airplanes, looking for stragglers.\nSomehow, by miracle, they didn't see her.\nShe was always worried about me. Now, she was worried also that |\nwas caught. So we were both in a state of great anxiety.\nWhen we came together, she said she made up her mind that we\nwere not going to separate again. Whatever happens to us, we'll go\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\ntogether. That's the way it was going to be, whatever happens we'll be\ntogether, we're not going to be apart.\nShe was worried mainly for the children. | Knew she didn't care about\nherself, because she knew what was happening in the concentration camps,\nthat the children didn't survive at all.\nSo she, with the help of her friend, started thinking again of finding a\nway. What they came up with, because we were three girls, she managed to\nobtain false identities of Catholics. We were going to just leave there,\nescape from there into a town where nobody knew us.\nThat's what the friends helped her, we managed to get onto a train in\nJaroslav -- I'm sorry, in Touste. This was going to be a trip to a place called\nJaroslav. | had no idea why that town, but it was on the way to Krakow. The\ntown was already without any Jews there. We just hoped nobody would\nrecognize us, you know. | was blonde, real blonde, and | had green eyes, so\n| didn't look Jewish.\nWe didn't speak Yiddish. Our accents were very Polish. My mother\nthought we had maybe a chance.\nSo we said good-bye to our friends, none of whom survived,\nunfortunately. We boarded the train and started our trip. This was going to\nbe four days and four-night trip. In olden days it took a long time. It was\nwartime. We knew we had to change in places. Anyway, the friends\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\ncollected little money for her. We had two suitcases left of all, everything that\nwe ever had. That's how we started our trip to Jaroslav.\nAs we were traveling, a young man attached himself to us, started\nchatting us up, talking about the children and my mother. Slowly, slowly he\nstarted pushing, asking if there was anybody Jewish in the family, maybe the\nfather, grandfather. It was enough if it was great-great-great grandfather was\nJewish, you were still Jewish. Didn't have much chance.\nSlowly, slowly he wore my mother down, and you can imagine a\nmother with two kids, terrified, not knowing where we're going, what to do.\nShe said to me finally, you know, | could not resist anymore. | couldn't\nwithstand the pressure, and | told him, yes, indeed, we are Jewish. At which\npoint, he said, well, you know, | have to take you to the gestapo. And I'm\ngoing to Jaroslav as well, so | will look after you.\nHe did, he looked after us very carefully. He was very sure to have\neven my sister or me in his sights. But we had nowhere to run. We weren't\ngoing to run anyway.\nAs we were traveling, then my mother started again thinking of\nsomething. She didn't know what, but she wanted to do something. She\nknew we didn't have any way to escape.\nThe main thing with her was not to be separated from the children.\nShe did not want the children to be taken away from her.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection -\nSo she started speaking with him, and she said, \"Look, | will give you\nthe receipts for my two suitcases and all the money | have.\" Even she\npromised the coats we had on our backs. She said \"| just want you to do one\nthing for me. When we get to the gestapo, could you have us shot\nimmediately, all three of us, because | don't want to be separated from my\nchildren, | don't want the children to suffer.\"\nHe promised he would. So that's how we traveled, four days, four\nnights. We were absolutely exhausted as you can imagine. Whilst we were\ntraveling, | wasn't thinking hard, but we neared Jaroslav and | started\nworrying a little bit. | was afraid of dying, as anybody would, even a small\nchild would.\nMy sister was completely unaware of all this. She was very young,\nlike 2 years old, 2 1/2. We didn't tell her anything. For me, it started being a\nbig deal. | got scared and didn't want to die.\nAs we got off the train, we started walking towards gestapo, and |\nstarted pulling at my mother saying \"Mom, mom, | don't want to die.\" My\npoor mom looked at him and said \"Look, why don't you let her go? She's\nblonde and she could probably get away with it, maybe she will survive.\"\n| said \"No, | don't want to go by myself. | want you and my sister to\ncome too\" obviously.\nSo as we're walking, she says to him, \"Do you have children of your\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nown?\"\nHe said \"Yes.\"\nShe said \"Look, I've given you everything | have. Why do you want us\non your conscience? Just let us go and try our luck.\"\nAnd something touched him, and he thought about it, and he said\n\"You don't have a chance,\" he said, but he left us.\nSo he left us in the middle of the town, strange town, didn't know, the\nmain road, left us. There we were. We had nothing. He took everything with\nhim, of course. We were just three of us.\n>> Bill Benson: You have nothing but your, at least now still alive --\n>> Halina Peabody: We have our lives. Yes, yes.\n>> Bill Benson: Tell us, Halina, before you tell us how you started your new\nlife in Jaroslav, you are just 8 1/2, 9 years old, and you are now having to be\nsomebody that you're not, with a whole new identity, new religion. What do\nyou recall of the difficulty of that, of being so prepared that you wouldn't get\ntripped up by somebody like another person like this man asking probing\nquestions to figure out who you really are?\n>> Halina Peabody: Well, | didn't know much, but | was a kid. | knew | had\nto cross myself going in the church, with the right hand, and coming out. At\nthat age, didn't know much more.\n>> Bill Benson: You had to have a different name?\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\n>> Halina Peabody: Oh, yes. That was the first thing, my mother sat me\ndown, gave me all of the new details. A new name, new birth date, new\ngrandparents, different area, everything, yes. | knew, | was aware. Fear will\nkeep you straight. | was pretty well-trained by my mother anyway.\n| had all of the details, and the trouble was with the papers that we\nnever knew whether they were good or not. My mother was always worried\nabout that. To this day, | don't know, because | gave them to the Holocaust\nMuseum. | don't know if the papers were real or not. They were sold to us\nby a priest, that's all | Know. There were stamps. Those days there were no\ncomputers. Thank goodness now. It was better not to be checked. That\nwas one of my mother's problems, because when we were left in the town,\nshe needed to find a place to stay so we wouldn't be on the street, because\nthe Germans were just walking around with the gun at the side, it was very\neasy. Life was very cheap.\nWe walked into a little cafe where my mother started asking if they\nknew of somebody who could take lodgers in. A young man got up, said he\nknew of a washer lady. He said he would walk us to her, which he did. The\nlady saw mother and two children, of course in a terrible, exhausted\ncondition. She said she'll take us in.\nHer sons were very much against it, but she said -- she was a real\nChristian, | say always. A mother and two children, she said | have to help.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nWhat we got was a bed. That's all we needed. My mother told her we have\nno money, but that next day she would go to find a job, and she would --\nwhatever she earns she would bring, and for Keeping us. That's exactly what\nshe did.\nShe did the housekeeping job. You had to steal a little food here and\nthere. That was the way during the war. She did change this job a couple of\ntimes.\nMy sister was very sickly. She was very worried about my sister\nbecause she really was sick. She was also worried about my sister's hair,\nbecause my sister's hair is completely like an afro, very, very curly. In\nPoland, the Polish girls have straight, blonde hair. Mine was wavy, so it\nwasn't so bad, but she was really an afro.\nWhat she did, under the pretext she needs to make them thicker, she\nshaved her head a couple of times because she was so worried.\nThere was school for Polish kids for one -- for two hours a day. One\nhour for religion, one hour for the other things. That's where it helped me,\nbecause | learned the catechism from A to Z very quickly, because | could\nread. That was the way they taught religion at the time. | think it's changed\nnow.\nWe went to church on Sundays, which was lovely. Mass was said in\nLatin. It was a kind of nice place to be, and it was warm, the incense was\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nlovely and the lights. It was the only place actually that felt a little more safe,\nsomehow.\n| was sent over to the neighbor to help, apparently this neighbor was\nsomehow partly German, so he had the right to have a laborer for free, so |\nwas sent to help him in the kitchen. So my mother always thought it was\ngood to be working.\nThe Germans, all they wanted to know is that everybody was working\nfor them. That was the main thing.\nDuring that time, we had one letter from our friends, who before they\nperished. And that letter was through the Red Cross, that came to us, which\nthey forwarded, which told us that my father was safe with his sister in\nPalestine.\nNow, we knew there was a part of the family that immigrated to\nPalestine, now Israel, in the 1930s, 1932, | think. And that was my father's\nsister with her four children. But we never met them. We didn't even know\nwhich town. But the fact that he was out of Russia, which was so important,\nbecause he was a prisoner for 20 years hard labor, so the fact that he was\nout gave us some hope and something to hang on to during this terrible time.\nWe had very little information what was going on in the front, anything\nlike that. No radios, no papers.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\n>> Bill Benson: This woman that you described was kindly, who took you\ninto her home, you had a place to stay. She had some sons that were a\ndifferent story.\n>> Halina Peabody: Correct, yes. One of her sons, the youngest one, did\nsomething that was a death penalty as well. He killed pigs for a living.\n>> Bill Benson: Clandestinely?\n>> Halina Peabody: Of course. The Poles were not allowed to have meat\neither. We were always afraid they'd come around and look for him. They\nwere always looking for him, never found him. She had four sons.\n>> Bill Benson: The Germans came by?\n>> Halina Peabody: Yes, later. We had something else in common. In the\nmeantime, my mother was always trying to think of a surer way, better way.\nAs | said, she decided that maybe it would be good to hide in plain sight. If\nshe could work for a German military camp up the road, she would have an\nidea like that. If she was stopped in the street, if she showed them the ID\nworking for the Germans, they would let you go. Otherwise, they might\ninquire papers, this, that, or the other. This way, she felt, would be a little\nsafer, because she was forever thinking of security. She was worried my\nsister was playing in the street with curly hair, everything was scary.\nSo she applied to the German military camp for work. Then she told\nher they have to check the papers, so again we lived in fear for weeks. |\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\ndon't know if they ever checked it. Who knows? That far back.\nAnyway, after about eight weeks, she got the permit and started\nworking as you saw. She was working in the kitchen peeling potatoes with\nsome other people. That was her job. She had the Ausweiss, she had the\nID. At that point, it became very important, because one night the Germans\ndecided to look for the son again, and came great noise and screams. They\nusually came like that in the middle of the night.\nOpen the door, they came in, they checked, and they took everybody\nin, and they said they were looking for him. Of course, he wasn't there. They\nwere going to take everybody into the station to check them out. But then my\nmother got up and showed the ID. He said \"No, you stay.\"\nSo the only Jews in the place stayed.\n[Laughter]\nThe others were just checked out and brought, came back the next day,\nbecause they were all employed, working one way or the other. That was the\nkind of thing that you had to always be watchful.\n>> Bill Benson: Your mother, when you described her, what she did, the\ncourage that that took, to not only have a hidden identity, but to go right into\nthe den of the enemy, right into their camp and work. Must have been just\nterrifying.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ..\n>> Halina Peabody: She used to come with all sorts of stories. At one point,\nshe came, she said one of the officers came in with a dog, and he said that\nthis dog has been trained to smell out Jews. She said look, | know this is\nimpossible, but what if this dog takes fancy to me?\n[Laughter]\nThat kind of stuff. It's amazing what -- you know. But she felt she got a little\nmore secure by having this ID. That's how we lived, you know. | went to\nschool, for the two hours, as | said. The lady who looked after us, the\nhostess, was very nice, and she wanted very much -- she was a real, as |\nsaid, a real Christian. She wanted to save my soul, particularly me.\nMy mother was too old. My sister was too young. But |! was there.\n>> Bill Benson: You were just right?\n>> Halina Peabody: | was just right. She sent me for a lesson in\ncommunion, and | have a picture going to communion.\n| was OK. My mother always said, she kept me straight, she said \"We\nall pray to the same God. So it doesn't matter what religion\" you know. She\nsaid \"But if you're born Jewish, you may as well stay Jewish.\"\n>> Bill Benson: Halina, you would continue under these circumstances,\nliving in Jaroslav to the end of the war. As the Russians were advancing, of\ncourse, there were battles taking place in Jaroslav. There you were living in\nthat house. Tell us what happened.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ..\n>> Halina Peabody: Yeah. Well, one morning we woke up, since we were\non the main road there was the clapping of horses and carts. We kids used\nto go and steal food from them sometimes. They were always going back\nand forth, but at this point, this morning, it was completely quiet. It was a\ndeathly silence. We didn't know what was happening.\nMy mother was still talking about maybe she should get up to go to\nwork, she didn't know. | was standing by the window, by the bed. She was\nin bed with my sister. Suddenly, there was a tremendous bang, and a bomb\nfell on us.\n| started screaming \"My hand! My hand!\"\nMy mother got up, grabbed me. The kitchen was down, | mean, the roof fell\ndown. My mother grabbed me by the other hand, we walked into the street.\nThe hospital was about a block and a half away. She carried my sister, so\nshe couldn't carry me. But my hand was bleeding badly.\nWe managed to get to the hospital. She -- they picked me up there,\nand they cleaned me up. They told my mother that my hand is very dirty,\nthere was no penicillin. They were going to have to probably amputate.\nMy mother was -- | can't even -- well, any mother, any parent can\nknow what she was thinking. | was hospitalized, of course. My mother\nstayed the night with my sister. The next morning she went back to the\nplace. It was unlivable already. A neighbor took her in. Apparently, the lady,\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection :\nour hostess, was underneath, she was in the kitchen and she was killed by\nthe roof falling down, so she passed away. And my mother was taken by the\nneighbor.\nIn the meantime, the nurses there were nuns, very lovely ladies,\nalways in white, very beautiful ladies, little blonde hair coming out |\nremember. They took care of me. She saved my hand -- they saved my\nhand. They simply had to do a lot of burning out the stuff, because it was all\nopen wound. So they had to cauterize it a lot.\n>> Bill Benson: You mentioned no penicillin for infection, nor pain\nmedications.\n>> Halina Peabody: Right. Well, the pain was the cauterizing.\n>> Bill Benson: Right.\n>> Halina Peabody: The nun would tell me to scream. She would say \"Put\nyour hand in my habit and scream.\" My poor mother used to run for miles\njust not to hear it.\n>> Bill Benson: The day that that happened, essentially, was the end of the\nwar for that part of Poland. It was over, you were injured on that last day?\n>> Halina Peabody: Well, yes, that's right. The Russians came in. My\nmother said they were going to stay, too. She knew.\n>> Bill Benson: Now you're under the Russians again?\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ..\n>> Halina Peabody: Now we're under the Russians. My mother is trying hard to think of how to get\nto find my father. She started knitting a little bit to earn a little money, and we were with the neighbor.\n| was in the hospital for about two months. | wanted to say who | was immediately, but my\nmother told me that | can't, because, unfortunately, there was a pogrom by the Poles.\nI'm not saying all of the Poles are bad, but that was my experience. A few people that came\nout of hiding were killed by the Poles. | had to keep the pretense of being a Catholic. So that's what |\ndid.\nIn the meantime, | think the stress on my mother was so great that she was diagnosed with\nbreast cancer, and the doctor urged us to have the operation, because he didn't want us to be\norphans. My mother had to go through that. In the meantime, she was writing to wherever she could,\nand luckily for us the radio station in Tel Aviv recognized the names. There was a lady there, so we\ngot in touch with my father.\nMy father sent a cousin of mine, who was in the British army, and he came to put us in touch\nwith the Jewish agency. We had to move closer to Krakow. Again, we had to keep our pretense,\nbecause we were asked if we wanted lodging. \"Are you really Polish?\"\nMeaning are you Jewish? We had to keep the pretense up, until we got into the main kind of group of\npeople being taken over to Germany.\nWhat they did, they put you in a sort of communal home, then you were taken by lories, trucks\nthey're called here, took you about a kilometer or two past the frontier between Poland and Germany,\nand you took a train to Berlin.\nWe missed my father twice, but finally we did make contact.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection s\n>> Bill Benson: Wasn't there one point, Halina, in a tremendously bitter\nirony --\n>> Halina Peabody: Oh, yes.\n>> Bill Benson: You know where I'm going.\n>> Halina Peabody: Whilst in this communal home at one point, they\naccused us of trying to pretend to be Jewish because we wanted to get out of\nPoland.\n[Laughter]\n>> Bill Benson: It was hard to prove that was the case?\n>> Halina Peabody: My mother said my husband's name was Isaac. People\nsigned up for it. That was real irony, yes. That was, yes.\nSo we managed -- the frontier was a Polish guard, and a Russian\nguard, because there was some agreement that the Jews can be sort of\ntaken out of Poland, if they wanted to.\nSo they had some problems, they had to take some extra watches to\nget through. Then at the German station, they refused to sell us tickets\nbecause we were Jews. That was already after they lost the war. But\neventually, we managed to get to Berlin, and | got white bread and cheese.\nSlowly, slowly we ended up in Italy for a couple of months, where my\nfather caught up with us. We then had the choice, because my father when\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0\nhe left Russia was in a Polish unit which became part of the British unit. He\nwas actually stationed in Egypt.\n>> Bill Benson: As part of the British army?\n>> Halina Peabody: British, yeah. We didn't have to wait for visas. We had\nthe right to go either to Palestine or to England. My parents chose England,\nSO we ended up going to England, where | went to school and my mother\nrefused to put me in the Polish school where | wanted to go, because | knew\nPolish so well, and English | didn't know. But she insisted. She said \"If\nyou're living now in England, you got to learn English.\"\n>> Bill Benson: When you finally reunited with your father, what was that\nlike?\n>> Halina Peabody: Difficult. Yeah. | was my mother's partner all these\nyears, and suddenly | was a child, so it was not easy. It was a loss of\nsomething there, but it wasn't easy.\n>> Bill Benson: If you don't mind, I'm going to turn to our audience for a few\nquestions ina moment. | have one I'd like -- something I'd like you to talk\nabout. With your injury to your hand, of course, once you got established\nand you were living in England, you don't mind me saying you were very\nself-conscious about your injury.\n>> Halina Peabody: Of course.\n>> Bill Benson: You took up table tennis.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\n>> Halina Peabody: That's right.\n>> Bill Benson: Say a little about that.\n>> Halina Peabody: Yes. | actually wanted tennis, but tennis was impossible\nbecause there were no facilities really. But table tennis was available\neverywhere. | was in college, and then where we bought the house in\nLondon was club Maccabi, the Jewish youth club all over the world. It was\nright around the corner. | would go there every evening and play to my\nheart's content.\nWe had a team, we went around England. | got kind of a little better\nand better.\n>> Bill Benson: You became a champion.\n>> Halina Peabody: The boys coached me, yes. In Israel they have\nMaccabiah games every four years. They're like the Olympics, but only for\nJewish youth from all over the world.

In 1957, the next\nMaccabiah, | came back again, went back again with the table tennis, and |\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\ndecided to stay for a year.

That's how | got to the United States.\nWe came for a year in 1968.\n>> Bill Benson: Your mother must have been so proud of you, that you became a sports champion\njust like she had been.\n>> Halina Peabody: She was. She was. She was terrific, yes. She wanted\neverybody to be into sports, and now we have the same thing going in our\nfamily. We have basketball.\n>> Bill Benson: Star center, exactly right.\n>> Halina Peabody: Yes.\n>> Bill Benson: Halina, let's turn to our audience and see if they have questions. We have a few\nminutes. If you could make your question as brief as you can, and we hope to be able to use mics,\nthe hand mics if we can get them to you. That will help a lot.\n>> Hello. Could you describe how your mother got the papers that said you were Catholic?\n>> Halina Peabody: Yes. They bought it from a priest. | said purchased it,\nbecause he didn't give them to us, but he made those. A lot of people did.\nSo we're not the only ones. But this was a good business.\n[Laughter]\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\n>> Bill Benson: We have a question right here, about 2/3rds of the way back\nin the middle.\n>> Hi. Do you know what any of the letters that your father sent contained,\ninformation about what was happening after he was taken away to Russia, to\nbe a prisoner, that he had sent -- you had some communication with him\nbefore things got -- it was back in the beginning.\n>> Halina Peabody: We exchanged a few letters --\n>> Bill Benson: She's asking if you know what was in his letters. What was\nhe writing about?\n>> Halina Peabody: Well, he was writing about the fact that his conditions\nwere not the worst, because he being a dentist and there was no medical\npeople in that camp, he was made into a sort of medic. So that's what he\nsaid.\n| remember we sent him a package of a pillow and some food. But he\nwas incarcerated for 20 years. Officially.\n>> Bill Benson: That was his sentence, right?\n>> Halina Peabody: That was his sentence, yes.\n>> Bill Benson: We have another question. Young man right here. Yes, sir?\nWe'll bring you the mic.\n>> When your father fled before the Soviet occupation, did he have intentions\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nof figuring out a way of getting yourself and your mother and sister out, or\nwas that just to avoid --\n>> Halina Peabody: Well, some people did take families with them. As |\nsaid, he was worried about my sister because she was a baby, my mother\nwas breast feeding her. He was worried it was too much. Rather than stay\nover, he decided to come back. That's when he was caught. It would have\nbeen better if we had all gone over. But that was what happened.\n>> Bill Benson: As | think you explained at the time, there was that, initially a\nsense that only the men had to be fearful anyway.\n>> Halina Peabody: That's right. That's right. That's correct. It was true\nexcept they didn't know the rest of the plan, yeah.\n>> How old were you when you reunited with your father?\n>> Halina Peabody: | was close to 14. A lifetime.\n>> Bill Benson: That's a lot of years.\n>> Halina Peabody: Yes. Yes.\n>> Bill Benson: A question back here?\n>> Thank you very much. Was your family ever reimbursed for the loss of\nyour home or any of your previous belongings before you were taken away?\n>> Halina Peabody: Well, the Germans did make some restitution, but how\ndo you pay for these things? Of course not. Yeah. When we went back to\nZaleszczyki, this is now Ukraine, they said we don't have the money to pay,\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nplus our house was destroyed.\nNow, for my wounded hand they did give me sort of like Social\nSecurity. That's all, you know. There's no money that you can really\nreimburse people, but they did try to do something. They tried to repay\nsomething to give us some feeling that they're sorry for what they've done.\nBut it's not the compensation, it just never leaves you. This is we ask God for\nlife, but we are pleased and happy to have a family.\n| always say this is our revenge on Hitler.\n>> Bill Benson: Halina, besides your immediate family, your sister, your\nmother, your father, did any other relatives survive?\n>> Halina Peabody: Well, my aunt survived in Russia, and she and my\ncousin and uncle were coming through. My uncle died on the way, but my\ncousin and my aunt came over. My cousin became a doctor in England, very\nsuccessful. And my aunt lived until a good age in England. Yes.
