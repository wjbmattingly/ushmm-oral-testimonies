And we had a fence around the \u0152 Dad had a fence around the ge \u0152 our yard, and that, and my mother always put me out there to play with my toys while she cleaned her house, when I was little. Well, this here guy who were \u0152 whoever it was, was drinking pop, and the \u0152 and his bottle \u0152 bottle went empty, I guess, so he just tossed it over the fence into my \u0152 into my Dad\u2122s yard. And Mom always put me out in the yard, cause it was safe to play there, because it \u0152 she had a lock on the \u0152 on the gate, so I wouldn\u2122t get out and get run over with a car, wi \u0152 which I \u0152 which I did anyhow.

Anyhow \u0152 let\u2122s see now \u0152 I wasn\u2122t going to tell you that. Th-Th-The \u0152 the \u0152 so anyway, the \u0152 this time that I got hit twice right \u0152 right in front of our house, cause it was in the wintertime and we were in \u0152 in a \u0152 was in a \u0152 this \u0152 the outskirts of the town, like. And my two ol der brothers, they wanted to go across the s \u0152 Ligonier Street, that was the main street going down through Latrobe , and make us new \u0152 new fort, because they want to have a snowball battle. And my mother said no, you can\u2122t go, cause if you go over there without Grant , he\u2122s gonna go across the road and get hit with a car. Well, she was right there, because a-and \u0152 and my dad, my dad was an invalid ever since he was two years old, and his \u0152 he got sick, and his mother took him to the doctors and the doctors gave him the wrong medicine, and he wound up with polio, an d he was crippled, a nd he had walked on crutches all his life from \u0152 well, in s \u0152 he was \u0152 well, I \u0152 I forgot just how old he was, he wasn\u2122t very old. He was two years old, I think it was. And, he started out on crutches. He walked on them until he was 41 years old, and then \u0152 then here he got bursitis in his shoulders, and he couldn\u2122t us e his crutches no more, so he went to a wheelchair. And he lived in the wheelchair and \u0152 until his death, which was 36 years later. And \u0152 but he had a \u0152 an office job, and he worked there 45 years. And I told him whenever he retired, I says, but one thing about Dad, why, none of your sons are gonna work as long as you did at one job, beca use we were all too old for, you know, to get started on it.

And she \u0152 she gave each one of us an ap ple. And I\u2122ll always forget \u0152 I always remember that woman. I \u0152 how I wished I would have got her name and address, because she was so good to us. Then she took me around, I don\u2122t know why she picked on me, but she took me around her house, showed me all around in there, her house and everything. And she had three so ns that was in the army, German army. Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 14 But they were all prisoners of war. We had one, and England had one, and the Russians had one. I said to her, well, I said, I\u2122ll tell you, I says, you\u2122re pretty sure of getting those two \u0152 two of them back out of those three, alive. And I says, now the one we have and the one the \u0152 the \u0152 at \u0152 let\u2122s see what a \u0152 well, we\u2122ll say England , and the one they have, the British, th-the \u0152 I said, the one the British have and the one we have you\u2122re pretty sure of getting those two back. But, I says, the one that the Russians have, I says, I can\u2122t tell you ab out them, I said, those guys are nuts. I said, all they want to do is kill everybody. And so that\u2122s exactly what they did."

Well, we always had scouts out, two scouts. They\u2122d be abou t oh, say, 200 yards ahead of us. Now, they were not supposed to shoot any bra \u0152 any Germans that they seen, but they were supposed to give us the silent signal. The silent signal was a \u0152 y-you laid your rifle down, you grabbe d ahold of it and \u0152 by the barrel and by the \u0152 and by the back Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 15 of it, and you put it above your head and go like that.

            "answer": "Yes, they \u0152 and they \u0152 and they didn\u2122t make a sound. Well, anyhow, then whwhen we got that message, by boy they just \u0152 they bl ew a whistle and we just spread out and start digging in right away, because we knew we were running into a trap. And so the Germans, they smartened up. They thought by us cat \u0152 by us having those two scouts there, they were told tr \u0152 told, do not shoot the scouts. Th-The German did. He says, wait til they get through your lines, but make sure they don\u2122t see you to give out and give the \u0152 us the \u0152 the warning. Says go, and \u0152 wait a minute now, I think of something about that \u0152 anyhow, he says, let them go through your ra-ranks, but make sure they don\u2122t see you. And then, when they get through it, grab them, and then we\u2122ll put them in \u0152 in prison, then, for the \u0152 you know, the \u0152 the \u0152 the ten \u0152 well, anyhow, the prison. And so anyway, that\u2122s what they did, cause we lost both of our scouts at first, but we got them back after a bit, cause one of our shells went and blew the fence down, and wa \u0152 th-then they shot out of it, and they got back with us again. And they said th at when they were \u0152 the Germans ran, he says, we ran right with them. He says, those shells and that you guys were shooting at us, well, they didn't give a hoot who they killed. So anyhow th ey \u0152 the scouts, we ha \u0152 we had them scouts, but whenever they give that signal, we would \u0152 we would Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 16 \u0152 see, we\u2122d be going in the single file, ma ybe might be three or four in a row, you know how they are when you\u2122re marching. And as soon we got that signal boy, you s \u0152 just spread right out. And every body got their \u0152 we had little shovels. You probably sm \u0152 maybe you seen them alrea dy. And we\u2122d dig a foxhole and get down in under below the ground surface. And then that \u0152 then the \u0152 we were ready for fight then. But if you \u0152 if we didn\u2122t see that signal, why we would walk right into this trap. Now, we ran into one of them traps, and all of a sudden they start shooting. And I hit the ground right where I was, you \u0152 whenever \u0152 when they start shooting, nobody has to tell you to get down and stay down, you learn that quick, because you want to live a little longer. So anyhow, we went and \u0152 wait a minute now. We \u0152 well, we \u0152 we got up there an-and then the Germans start shooting at us, and we got down and then we start shooting back. Well, I was out, right out in the open spaces there. Well, my buddy was, when he was shooting his rifle, I was reloading mine. And when I was shooting mi ne, he was reloading his. So we had a steady sho \u0152 stream of bullets going up where the machine gunners were. So anyhow, they went out and he \u0152 he turns on me. I was laying down on the ground shooting there, and I didn\u2122t have no trees or nothing to get behind, I was out in the open. And my buddy, he \u0152 he got the only tree that was there, he \u0152 he dove behind it. Anyway, and the Germans saw me. So he turns the machine gun on me. Now, he [indecipherable] like, well, we\u2122ll just \u0152 there, there. We\u2122ll just say here Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 17 [indecipherable] right here. I stretched out this way, see, and up \u0152 the Germans are up that way, and he starts shooting at me, and he come about that far away from my body. He dug a hole, a trench with that machine gun, from my head down to my feet, about four inches deep with those bullets. That\u2122s \u0152 an-and I was laying right there, all that dirt was flying in my f ace and all over my body and that. And I was trying to crawl inside of my helmet, but I wasn\u2122t do \u0152 doing good. My head was already in there. So I got to thinking, if I laid still, he\u2122d think he killed me, and he\u2122ll go and shoot somebo \u0152 at somebody else. So whenever he stopped \u0152 he had to stop and reload, you know, and when he\u2122d run out of shells, why he\u2122d take a couple of minutes for him to get the new belts i-in there of shells. Well, while he was doing that, I was lay \u0152 laying there figuring out wh at I was going to do to him. Anyhow, I had dirt and mud and everyt hing in my face, and all over my body and everything else. The whole way down my body, I was just covered with dirt an-and m-mud, you might say. So anyway, I \u0152 I got a \u0152 while \u0152 while he was shooting, h-he to \u0152 he change his \u0152 his targets then. He looked for somebody that was \u0152 he could see, cause he saw me laying there and he figured he\u2122d killed me, see? Well, that worked. Anyhow, he starts shooting at somebody el se. Now, when he starts shooting at somebody else, I was the only one in the outfit that had rifle grenades. The captain come out to me when we \u0152 fe \u0152 before we started out that day and he says, Shultheis. I said, yes sir? He says, you\u2122re my grenadier. I said, yes, sir, I said, sir. Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 18 He says, yeah, what do you want? He said \u0152 I said, what\u2122s a grenadier? He ha \u0152 he said, you\u2122re the guy to stop the tanks. So I pulled one \u0152 I pulled out the gre-grenade, he gave me a ba \u0152 a pa \u0152 a bag like, se e, I would call it a bag. Anyhow, it fit over your shoulder and it had six grenades in it; three of them phosphorous and three expl \u0152 high e-explosion. So I said to him, what am I supposed to do with these? He says, you\u2122re supposed to stop the tanks. I picked it out and I said, sir, I said, you think that this little thing here is going to stop one of them great big tanks? He says, I know it will. I says, what do I shoot at, whenever I shoot at that tank? And he says, the tracks. Now, I never knew this before that \u0152 before that day. He says I \u0152 when the tracks are gone, there\u2122s a \u0152 a little track in the center of the tank, and it \u0152 and it runs \u0152 it keeps those su \u0152 tracks on th e wheels like, even, so that they don\u2122t come off. And he says, all you gotta do is hit that wheel, it\u2122s about that big, he said. But that\u2122s like telling you to go jump in the lake. Anyhow, I said yes, sir, I says, I think we can stop them all right then, if we can \u0152 if I can hit that \u0152 if I can just hit that there part where you just told me. And so anyhow, he s \u0152 he \u0152 he agreed with me on it. So he went and let me figure it out myself. So \u0152 but I \u0152 I never saw a tank after that. S \u0152 but I did use them on \u0152 on machine guns, and boy it worked good. So anyway, this one whose \u0152 this machine gun ner that was shooting at me, I th \u0152 I thought, if I stop jiggling around here, that th \u0152 that he\u2122ll think he killed me, because he was pretty far away, you know. So, by gollies, it worked. I laid still and Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 19 he sh \u0152 quit shooting at me. I guess he must have stop \u0152 must have ran out of shells and he had to put another belt on, and wh ile he was putting that belt on, I \u0152 I \u0152 I rigged up my \u0152 my grenade launcher on my ri fle, and you shoot those grenades with a blank. So they told me, they says, for God\u2122s sakes, make sure you don\u2122t have a live round in your rifle when you shoot that, because he says, if you shoot that with a live round, you\u2122re gonna blow your own head off, whenever you would shoot that \u0152 that grenade, he says, instead of it going that way, it would stay right where it was and knock your head off. So th-that \u0152 that\u2122s a good \u0152 good lesson. So \u0152 so I never did, I always checked it all \u0152 all the time, make sure. So anyway, I said to my buddy, I says, I\u2122m gonna fix those babies now. And he says yeah, you know, what are you gonna do? I says, I\u2122m gonna send th em a phosphorous grenade. So I put a phosphorous grenade on cause they are \u0152 they were the worst. The high explosions, they were bad, but th \u0152 but the \u0152 the others, they were worse, they \u0152 oh, man, they were miserable. They \u0152 cause when they \u0152 when this phosphorous grenades went off, they didn\u2122t quit burning when \u0152 if it hits you. Say like if a \u0152 if it hits you in \u0152 in your arm, that would burn the whole wa y through your arm. It\u2122ll melt your \u0152 even melt your bones, they said. And that\u2122s how hot it went. Anyway, I said to my buddy, I says, okay, I says, I\u2122m ready to sh oot, I says. You watch up over the top of them trees, see if you can see it going. And I stuck the huge \u0152 you always stick the \u0152 the stock of your rifle in the ground an d raise the barrel up. And I was laying there Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 20 beside it there, and I raised her up, and I said, you wa \u0152 I says, are you watching? He said yeah. I said, well, here it goes. I reached down and I pulled the trigger. Well, that grenade, you could see it. I-It goes pretty fast, but you can still see it going. It went \u0152 oh, it made a beautiful bo w right up over the top of the trees and come down. And on the way down, it must have hit a \u0152 a limb, because I don\u2122t think it went off at the ground, becaus e it seemed like it \u0152 when the \u0152 when it disappeared and you couldn\u2122t see it, why, it was \u0152 wasn\u2122t enough time for it to hit the ground when it exploded. But when it exploded, it made a great, big puff of smoke, and flames, and \u0152 and \u0152 and it \u0152 a nd the phosphorous was everywhere. And I heard them guys screaming up there where they \u0152 where I was shooting at, so I \u0152 I \u0152 I\u2122m pretty sure I hit them, because that was them screaming. Now, I never seen any of them, or anything like that, becaus e they were pretty well camouflaged. Anyway, we \u0152 we \u0152 that stopped that whole [indecipherable] that whole battle. The Germans jumped up after I shot that, and they ran ba-backwards, back over \u0152 to get away from us. Our outfit, they \u0152 they got up, they ran back the other way, I ne \u0152 I never figured out yet why they went that way, cause it was a gort in the wrong direction. So anyway, we didn\u2122t see no mo re Germans that night. And the me \u0152 and my buddy, he s \u0152 he \u2122s young. Come on Shultheis, come on Shultheis, everybody\u2122s leaving us. I said, I\u2122m not leaving til I get my rifle reloaded. And I ha \u0152 I had to take all my stuff off my rifle, and that \u0152 you know, the launcher and everything, and \u0152 to Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 21 get to my rifle to work right with the bullets. And then I put a \u0152 a c \u0152 a clip with nine rounds in it, then I was ready to go . Then I stood up, and when I stood up there wasn\u2122t a soul around, just him and I. Our men got up, they went the one way and the Germans went the other way. And that \u2122s another thing I ne ver understood, why we went backwards instead of going forw ard. Anyway, we \u0152 we didn\u2122t have no more problems with them that night. And then \u0152 then my buddy and I, we went back to where the \u0152 kind of back to wher e the machine gunners were and they had to stay up all night on guard, so we \u0152 we each dug a slit trench. Now, a slit trench, I don\u2122t know whether you know what a slit tr ench is or not. Oh, you know? Okay, that\u2122s just where you can lay down in it, it\u2122s big enough. We di \u0152 we dug that, each one of us dug a bed, you might say. Filled full of leaves and then crawled down in under them leaves and go to sleep. And the \u0152 we let the \u0152 we let the machine gunners stay awake that night. So \u0152"

Now, whenever we got in there, got the gate open and that, what happened, see, the f \u0152 th e first guy in \u0152 in the line, he saw \u0152 he saw the lock.

An d I can see some blankets in there and I thought, oh boy, that\u2122d be ideal thing. I climbed up in the truck and it was full of dead soldiers and the blood all over everythi ng, oh what a mess. So I got out and let Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 23 the whole bunch go. I let the dead keep th e bla-blankets. But that\u2122s just the way things went."

See, there was a gate here, and then back here, they had the furnaces right here, and \u0152 and then \u0152 then they were over some more buildings here. And then they had other buildings where, lik e the prisoners stayed in, inside of that gate. Now, the Germans had, I would say, oh, 200 yards of field, all smooth cut. There wasn\u2122t a tree [indecipherable], so that if any of their prisoners escaped, their soldiers were supposed to shoot them and kill them. And they \u0152 and they had a lot of time to kill them because they had that whole say \u0152 we\u2122ll say 200 yards to \u0152 to go before they got to the woods. And so anyhow, I \u0152 the \u0152 we \u0152 we \u0152 I had a German in my sights that I kept in my sights there, because there was three prisoners chasing him after we opened the gates, see? And I sa id to my buddies, I says, look at that, I says, that German, he\u2122s running away from those guys. And I says, he\u2122s in A-1 shape and \u0152 and those three guys are in starvation shape, and I said, they\u2122ll never catch him. And he was head ing for those woods. So I got down on one knee, took the safety off of my rifle and \u0152 and I just got that guys \u0152 back of his head riding on the top of my front sight. And they said, what are you gonna do, Shultheis? I said, I\u2122m gonna knock that guy off if he \u0152 if it looks like he\u2122s gonna make to the \u0152 to Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 24 those trees. Cause I said, once he gets into those trees, I says, he\u2122s a free man, be an \u0152 and because he ga \u0152 he can have a \u0152 a th ousand places to hide. And \u0152 and I says, I don\u2122t think those guys are gonna be able to make it. Well, they \u0152 they were doing pretty good though, they \u0152 they were r unning and \u0152 and that German soldier was running, too, because they were after him. Anyhow, I \u0152 I noticed that the gap was getting closer, see, they were gaining on him. And I said to one of the guys, I says, well, I says, I guess I won\u2122t have to shoot hi m after all. I says, I think they\u2122re gonna make it. So they \u0152 here they caught him before he got to the trees. Now, if I \u0152 if I thought he was going to make it to the trees, I was going to shoot him, because he \u0152 he probably did a lot of things to those guys, and it didn\u2122t matter to me; he was a German, so that\u2122s \u0152 he was \u0152 there was no limit on him.

And here I happened to look down and I saw this key laying there. And th-t he people coming out of \u0152 out, was running right across it. And \u0152 and the G.I.s that was going into the camp walked over top of it too. Now, I was in a couple times in fra \u0152 like \u0152 well, let\u2122s see, where they \u0152 where they had the \u0152 had the shoe mines and stuff, they had [indecipherable] mine \u0152 [coughs] Excuse me. And the Germans were great for that there \u0152 having mine fields for us to walk onto. Only once that I got real, real close to losing a foot. But the lieutenant saved my hide. He \u0152 he was right behind me and he re he happened to Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 28 look down and he saw I was gonna just step on one. And all he did [indecipherable] he says, Shultheis , he says, stop immediately, he said [indecipherable] he said, stop, he says, a mine on \u0152 a mine there. And a \u0152 and I was coming down with my foot an d I froze right there, I never went another inch. And I looked down and there was a mine. If it wasn\u2122t for him, I would have a wooden leg now. He saved my li \u0152 my hide there. And the first \u0152 first one \u0152 time, why we were going, we had our \u0152 we started at three o\u2122 clock in the morning, it was pitch dark. We got out of our foxholes and the captain says, now, you\u2122re \u0152 you\u2122re to bring back \u0152 we\u2122re gonna \u0152 to bring back some Germans alive. And he \u0152 and he says, for God\u2122s sakes, and a few other words that y ou\u2122re not supposed to say, and he says, don\u2122t shoot them all, he says, we want to \u0152 we want to question them. He says, we\u2122re gonna \u0152 we\u2122re gonna g-go \u0152 we\u2122re gonna go after them about right, and he says, we want to know what we\u2122re gonna run into. So, anyhow, I \u0152 tha-that\u2122s \u0152 that\u2122s how that one went. Anyway, we \u0152 we went across the field then, and \u0152 and the \u0152 the one scout stepped on a mine. No w, he was about, I\u2122d say two \u0152 maybe a hundred yards ahead of us. Well, we didn\u2122t know what happened, we just heard the explosion, so we stopped, and the lieuten ant s-scattered us guys around \u0152 around this place where \u0152 where that noise come from, and you hear \u0152 what it was was one of the \u0152 the scouts. Anyhow, I said to him, I said, sir, I said, I\u2122ll go in there and I\u2122ll get that guy, and I\u2122ll bring him out. He said okay, but he says, wait a minute til we Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 29 get you a medic, he says, you\u2122re gonna need it. I said, all right. So he told his sergeant what to tell his men. The sergean t went over, he told the first guy, sa \u0152 medics wanted up front. And they passed it down the line, like the guy behind him and you know, like that. And then I took a few minutes and \u0152 and the medic come up. So the medic come out when I told him. I said, th \u0152 one of the scouts has some \u0152 he went haywire in here, I says. We don\u2122t know exactly what it is yet, and the lieutenant told me to wait til you got up here because I\u2122m going in after him and bring him out. And he says, oka y, he says, let\u2122s go. So I says, all right. So we went in and there \u0152 and I found him right away , he was laying by a bush, and he had one leg \u0152 one foot off. That\u2122s what those shoe mine were for. The Germans discovered it take at least four guys to get a \u0152 a wounded guy back to the rear, and that\u2122s four li \u0152 guys less shooting at hi \u0152 at his men. So, anyhow, we got the \u0152 th-the medic bandaged his \u0152 his stump up, and we got him up on his one good foot. And I had the \u0152 I had his arm around th \u0152 my neck and \u0152 and the medic had th \u0152 had a o \u0152 the other around and the \u0152 and we just ready to start out and he says, I could carry him better if I was on your side, he says, do you wa nt to trade? I says sure, I says, I can carry him no matter which side. So \u0152 so anyho w, we chi \u0152 we swi \u0152 switched. I took his arm off my neck, I went over and got his other arm, put it around my neck, the medic come on around. He puts his \u0152 put the other arm \u0152 his other arm around his neck, and na \u0152 and I says, are you ready to go? And he says yeah. So the medic Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 30 says, all right, let\u2122s go. Well, he took one step and he blew his foot off. Right where I was standing, I don\u2122t know how I missed it. I never even seen th \u0152 a mine there. And he\u2122s the only guy of all of them that I saw wounded that cried up \u0152 up front, on the line. And here, when he went in \u0152 wh en they sent him home after they got his artificial foot and that, why, he drank himself to death. And he \u0152 and his mother says that he couldn\u2122t stand being crippled."

Cause actually I really never seen them put them in, they \u0152 they \u0152 they gi \u0152 prisoners were standing there and then they \u0152 they went over to make sure he didn\u2122t have no weapons on him.

And \u0152 and it was darn near getting dark, and \u0152 and we \u0152 we were \u0152 we were gonna get a ride to \u0152 anyhow, he says, I want 12 men on every tank. So that\u2122s \u0152 we had to ride on the other side of the tank. We rode all night long, never stopped onc e. And oh man, we were about froze. It was snowing and blowi ng and that. So we stopped at daybreak and we were in a wide open field. It was a ll \u0152 like it was big, big gl \u0152 hay field, see?

And so I thought, oh well, if they can all go in there, I says, I think I\u2122ll go, too. So I slid down off the tank and \u0152 but only I took my rifle with me, they didn\u2122t, cause they wanted to have their arms free to carry wood back to make a fire.

So, I got over ther e near these guys running around like Indians, like a bunch of nuts gathering wood. They took it all back and t-t-t \u0152 to the tank and made a fire. Well, I see a shanty in there. I \u0152 oh, I\u2122ll be darned, I think I\u2122ll go see what\u2122s in that. I went over and I opened the door and I went in. Here was a Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 33 tool shed, like shovel, pick and rake and st uff like that. And so I went out and shut the door and [indecipherable] there was three loaves of homemade bread and German bread there on a shelf. Well, I didn\u2122t bother them, but I thought about eating one of them. And I walked around th e \u0152 around the building, there\u2122s another door. I opened up and I walked in and holy man I couldn\u2122t be lieve my eyes. Six Germans in there in bed, all sound asleep. I went around \u0152 let\u2122s see, how\u2122d I do that? Oh, I went around, I put my hands under each one of their pillows to see if they had any weapons in there, like a pistol or a dagger or something like that, because I was out numbered six to one right there, and they could have killed me real easy. So anyway, there was nothing. So then I went around again, and I took the top blanket and pulled it down to their ankle. They never opened their eyes, they just sit up in bed, got all that blanket, pulled it back down and \u0152 and laid back down again. I said, well alright you guys, you don\u2122t want to wake up, well, I\u2122ll wake you up. So I reached in my pocket and I pulled out a phosphorous hand grenade. I pulled the pin out of it and I held the lever down on \u0152 I don\u2122t know whether you know anything about grenades. Oh, you do? You know how you hold it down? Well, I was hanging onto it. I had my hand in the coal stove, they had a coal stove there, like a potbelly stove. And what I was gonn a do is drop that grenade in there and beat it out of that darn sh-shed. And all of a sudden I heard, all right Shultheis, what in the hell are you gonna do now? I says, oh, here is my sergeant, he come Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 34 looking for me. So I said, these guys won\u2122 t wake up, I said, I\u2122m ga \u0152 I\u2122m just gonna wake them up, that\u2122s all. He says, well, what are you doing with your hand in the stove? Well, there was no fire in the stove, it was out, so I s \u0152 told him about it and I says, I got a hand grenade here and I got the pin pulled out and I \u0152 and you\u2122re in my route, get the heck out of that doorway, because I said, I got nine seconds to g \u0152 from the time I let go of that grenade, before it goes off. And I want to be out of here and get into one of those trenches out there before it explodes. And so here, in our talking, one \u0152 one of them Germans woke up. He\u2122s sitting up there in the top f \u0152 top bunk, his legs hanging down, he\u2122s rubbing his eyes , you know. And I walk over to him. And he never seen me and he had his \u0152 both hands up there, rubbing his eyes there, getting the cobwebs out of them, I guess. And when he opened \u0152 took his hands down, he\u2122s looking right down th e barrel of my rifle. I says, all right, I says, the war\u2122s over for you guys. I said, get the ba \u0152 get them out of that beds. He said one word, brrp , they all just jumped right out of bed so quick and they all landed in the middle of the floor. There they are, all standing there with their long johns on and a pair of socks, that\u2122s all they had on. I says, as of right now, you are all prisoners of war. And here, in the meantime, my tanks th \u0152 they were getting ready to take off, they \u0152 I heard the motors starting up out there. They w \u0152 they\u2122d sit there for awhile to you know, get them warmed up. And I said to them, shake it up, and get your clothes on fast, I said, the tanks are getting ready to pull out and I don\u2122t Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 35 feel like walking any more. So, I said, I\u2122m going outside, and you come out when you get dressed. But, I said, don\u2122t hesitate, shake it out. So they got \u0152 th-th-they \u0152 they were \u0152 they oper \u0152 they c-cooperated pretty good. They come out and as each one would come out I would, you know, shake them down and see if I could feel any pistols or knives on them and that a nd none of them had any on. And I \u0152 and I showed them the tank that I was on. I says, now, I says, that\u2122s \u0152 that\u2122s the \u0152 the one I want to go on, that\u2122s the one I belong to. Either head for that th \u0152 tha \u0152 for \u0152 for that there Lanair(ph). And they said okay, so I said, all right, four [indecipherable] dudes, they got into a part, and so I had the six of them there. And the one says, there are three loaves of homemade bread in there, can I go get them? I says, no. I says, we don\u2122t have time to get them. I said, you hear them motors running down there? I said, them tanks are ready to take off. And I said, they \u2122re not gonna wait for me. But when I brought them out, and they saw me coming out of the woods with six prisoners, they s \u0152 they slowed their motors down and waited. And I took them over and I gave them to the \u0152 gave them to the lieutenant there at our tank, and that was the last I ever seen them, so I don\u2122t know how they made out, or what they did with them."

We got on the ship when \u0152 and I \u0152 Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 40 and darn if I didn\u2122t get seasick on the dumb thing. And I crossed that ocean four times. An \u0152 anyhow, we ca \u0152 I come and I got on the train, and the train conductor, I said to him, does this train stop in Latrobe ? He says no. I said, well where does it stop at? Pittsburgh. Well, I said, Pittsburgh, I said, it\u2122s just as far as \u0152 I was in Johnstown at this time. An-And he told me, you know, that he stopped at Johnstown and the next stop was Pittsburgh. And I said, I don\u2122t want to get off at Pittsburgh. Well, he says, that\u2122s tough luck, he says, the train doesn\u2122t co \u0152 stop anywhere else. So what I did, I \u0152 I hitchhiked home. And here I \u0152 first there was a \u0152 a young couple, they brought their bro \u0152 th e girl\u2122s brother, I think it was, back. He was going back into the service again, he was out on furlough. And this was in Johnstown. So then I \u0152 so that the \u0152 when my train come then, why, I asked the conductor, I said, th-this \u0152 does this train stop in Latrobe ? He says no. I said, well, where does it stop at? He says Pittsburgh. I said, well heck, that\u2122s too far away. I said, that\u2122s about as far as I am now, and \u0152 cause Johnstown and Pittsburgh about the same distance. So anyhow, instead of going \u0152 coming home on the train, I hitchhiked a ride. And this yo ung couple that brought her brother back to \u0152 to leave on the train there in Johnstown, why they picked me up and they took me so far, and then I was stuck, I was out on the highway there, and there was \u0152 there was snow, and the blowing, and I was about freezing to death, and anyhow, I-I was standing there thumbing, you know, and here comes a tra iler truck with a bighearted Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 41 guy behind the wheel. He stopped. He said, how far you going there Joe? And I says Latrobe. He says, hop in, he says, I\u2122m going past there practically, he says. So I jumped in there and \u0152 and \u0152 and we stop ped at one place there and he got coffee and that \u0152 and I called my wife up, it wa s after \u0152 after midnight then. I said, I\u2122m getting closer [indecipherable] I said, I\u2122m co \u0152 I\u2122m a-coming. So then yeah, I says, he\u2122s gonna let me off here at \u0152 you kn ow when you get to \u0152 on the highway out there where it comes to Latrobe. And I says, y \u0152 he said he\u2122d let me off there. And I said, we\u2122ll be there in a little while, I says , he stopped to get a cup of coffee, and I says, then \u0152 and then we\u2122ll be on our way. We ll, he di \u0152 he lets me off at \u0152 right at the crossroads there, and when he pulled out, here comes a \u0152 the old Ford out with my wife in it. My wife and two of her aunts and her brother, and he was driving the car. I\u2122ll always remember him, he says, you sure you got the right guy? So anyhow, that was our \u0152 my trip home. Then I went down to my \u0152 my dad\u2122s place to see my mother and dad, and that was al-almost three o\u2122clock in the morning. And then Mom says to me, she says, [indecipherable] here, you take my bed, you and Jenny take my bed and I\u2122ll go sleep with Dad. So that\u2122s what \u0152 that\u2122s the way we did then, for that night. Boy, it \u0152 it was wonderful being home, I\u2122ll tell you. She come arunning \u0152 she come running ou t of the car and she met me the halfway on \u0152 on the \u0152 on the highway. We were standing out there necking and it\u2122s a wonder we didn\u2122t get run over. But it was \u0152 it was something though, to see her again. I said, see, I told Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 42 you I was going to g \u0152 make it home. But I had quite a few times \u0152 I even had an airplane shooting at me. He \u0152 he \u0152 he wa s strafing our \u0152 our outfit. We were co \u0152 we were in a convoy, and then \u0152 and agai n I was up riding on th e tank. We did a lot of tank riding. And here he comes down the line, and at first \u0152 we were \u0152 first saw him, why the one guy says, ah look, here come one of our fighter planes. Well just about the time we looked, he opened up both guns on his plane, you know, he had one on each wing. And \u0152 well, there is only one wing, it was only one wing on them, I think. Anyhow, on the side of pr opeller was a machine gun. Now, when we saw the bu \u0152 the tracers coming out of that \u0152 out of those wings, we knew that he was not our friend at all. So anyway, I went and I put a \u0152 a \u0152 a rifle grenade on my rifle. I hurry up and got that on and got it all ready for him. I was ga \u0152 because heck, he was only about as high as the ceiling here. And so he\u2122s coming down, he was shoo \u0152 he \u0152 he did some damage and he killed a few guys, but \u0152 but he missed me. Anyhow, the guys all jumped off that tank but me. I stayed on and I \u0152 me and the \u0152 and the machine gunner. I wanted to see that machine gunner bring that plane down. Heck, he was only that high, I was \u0152 couldn \u2122t see how he could possibly miss it. So, we could see his bullets going \u0152 going down, you know, and when they were \u0152 when he was shooting at \u0152 at all the rest , you know, as he\u2122s coming down the line. So anyhow, I \u0152 let\u2122s see now. Oh, I\u2122m already with the grenade, that\u2122s it. So I got it ready for him and I had the safety off of my rifle, and I had it to my shoulder, and I Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 43 had that \u0152 had the play up \u0152 taken up on the \u0152 on the trigge r. All I had to do is just put a little bit of pressure on it and it would have went off. So, when I s \u0152 looked at him, and I says, heck sakes, this here \u0152 th is grenade is supposed to cover a 50 foot diameter, you know, like a circle. And I sa id, if I hit him, I\u2122m going to blow my own head off. I said, that\u2122s not going to be any good. So I didn\u2122t shoot. But I was going down there and \u0152 down there because a-another plane come right behind him, and the guys start shooting at him. And here he \u0152 he pulled his plane up so you could see the bottom of his wings, where he had our insignia on it. And th-the American insignia was a flag. And so then they, course, they stopped shooting at him. So then I watched him and when he co me down a piece, went a piece, why I \u0152 I don\u2122t know how that German knew that guy but \u0152 that guy was behind him \u0152 but anyway, he climbed for altitude. Now he went up, I would say, approximately a thousand feet. Now ma \u0152 I\u2122m not \u0152 might be a way off, but anyhow, when he made a circle, well the \u0152 the other di \u0152 guy who made a circle, the German, so did our man right behind him, when he circled. An d he ga-gave two bursts out o-of his \u0152 his \u0152 his \u0152 our man did, at the German plane. Well, he hit him both times, and when he hit him, I was watching him and the \u0152 the \u0152 when he shot first, why all of a sudden \u0152 the plane was going like this \u0152 all of a sudden the nose dropped down, and \u0152 and the plane was going down, it was heading towards the ground then. So th \u0152 our plane didn\u2122t shoot no more after. But the farther down he come, the more smoke Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 44 come out of that plane. And then finally it hit the ground and it exploded. Well, I watched that plane the whole way down and when it exploded, but it \u0152 th-the \u0152 the driver, he-he never made it out. And he was only a young fella too, because when he come down and passed there at one tim e, I saw him sitting in there with both thumbs on the \u0152 on the triggers, when he was shooting at me. And I thought, if I stand still, he\u2122ll miss me. Well, I had the bullets coming both sides of me. Well, the one \u0152 the one side, he got pretty close at getting me on that one, because I was leaning against the \u0152 the duffle bags of the \u0152 of the g-g \u0152 G.I.s in the \u0152 in the tank. They had them strapped to the [indecipherable] o-on the \u0152 on the outside of their tank. And two bullets went though that \u0152 that there tank I wa \u0152 or that sleeping bag that I was leaning on. But I didn\u2122t know that until after he was gone. So he missed me again."

            "answer": "Well, I \u0152 I also worked on a farm too. And I got a farm second day I was home, and \u0152 milking cows and stuff like that, b ecause I liked farming. The only thing was the pay, and \u0152 and then the \u0152 when th e war was over, why the prices started climbing, you know, and so I \u0152 my wife an d I talked it over, we thought it\u2122s time I got a raise. I was making a hundred dollars a month, and I got my house included in it. So I went to the farmer \u0152 farmer that I was working for, and I says, how about a raise? I says, the price of living\u2122s going higher, and my family was getting bigger now, I \u0152 cause I had \u0152 I had two \u0152 two child ren right in a row, one right after the other practically. And I \u0152 and I had a daughter and a \u0152 and a son. And so, course I made extra \u0152 the expenses. He says, oh, you just had to tell me Jenny is \u0152 that was my wife\u2122s name \u0152 she\u2122ll have to live within her means. Oh boy, did she blow up when I told her that. That didn\u2122t \u0152 that didn\u2122t the \u0152 hit right. So anyhow, I looked around, I started looking around, and I\u2122ve si \u0152 and I found a \u0152 a guy owned a horse farm, a Mr. Steiner, Steiner was his name, and I went to see him. Oh, he says, how much do you want paid? Well, I was making a hundred and \u0152 hundred and five dollars a month before, and I says 200 dolla rs a month. He says all right, and he took it. So I was \u0152 I worked with him then for oh, a good while. And \u0152 but so then here, after we \u0152 after we lived there, we lived in \u0152 right on the farm, the horse farm, we had about 40 horses. And he had good horses there, well \u0152 well bred stock. And so I went and \u0152 well, he \u0152 he went and he \u0152 he wanted my wife to do a lot of stuff Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 46 for nothing. And he was a millionaire himself, the bugger. So anyhow, you\u2122d \u0152 she \u0152 she \u0152 sh-sh \u0152 it wa \u0152 it wa \u0152 it was out of this world. She wasn\u2122t able to do that because she was taking care of like \u0152 say like me and my \u0152 my \u0152 well, my \u0152 my sister \u0152 my daughter and son. I had a daught er and a son then. So then they \u0152 they were \u0152 they were \u0152 they were born, a-and whenever \u0152 whenever we got the job \u0152 well, I got the job, and so I was working, I was taking care of these horses. We had about 40 horses altogether. An d I liked that job, it was pretty nice. But the only thing is, he wanted her to do a lot of extra work. Now, he was used to having fellas there that had foreign women for wives. They went in and they di d all that work for nothing, and that\u2122s what he wanted, see? And I said to him one day, I said, Mr. Steiner, I said, I\u2122m the one that applied for the job, not my wife. I said, she got \u0152 she got the house to take care of and two kids \u0152 we had two kids now, we had a girl and a boy, and \u0152 or a boy and a girl, I should say. And \u0152 and I says, she got two kids and a house to \u0152 and a house to take care of and me, and I said, that\u2122s enough for one woman. So then, here she \u0152 here she got all worked up over some stuff or something, and she wound up at a hospital. Well, while she was in the hospital, which was about three weeks, he didn\u2122t allow me off the farm to go see her. And that didn\u2122t go down very good. So \u0152 and she come home, she\u2122s mad as a wet hen and \u0152 and so I says, well, I couldn\u2122t help it, I said, that\u2122s \u0152 that\u2122s what he \u0152 he wouldn\u2122t let me go, and I says, and I had to have a job. So then, one day I come in \u0152 Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 47 well, we got it all straightened out with him then, abou t that. And then one day I come in the house and she\u2122s sitting there in her pa \u0152 kitchen crying. I said, what\u2122s the matter honey? Oh, Mr. Steiner is here \u0152 was here. I go, what in the heck did he want now? She says, he says, well, I got you at least doing some \u0152 some things. He wanted her to milk the \u0152 we had two cows. He wanted her to milk the cows, strain the milk; we had a cream separator. Churn \u0152 churn the cream into butter and we \u0152 we \u0152 we would get a \u0152 I think two pound of butter a week for doing that, that was going to be our pay. And \u0152 and I says, doggone him anyh ow. I says \u0152 I says, I\u2122m gonna quit. I says, the Russians haven\u2122t taken over yet. So \u0152 so I \u0152 I quit. And he \u0152 oh, he said when I told him that next morning, I said Mr. Steiner, I got bad news for you today. And I think this was on Thursd ay. I says, Saturday is my last day working here. He says, I ki nd of figured you do something like that. And I said, well, I says, I gotta look out for my wife. And I says, she\u2122s not that healthy. So anyhow, he says \u0152 all he said was, see th at you have your furniture on the truck by dinnertime on Saturday. And on Saturday we had a \u0152 our furniture on this truck and no place to put it. So \u0152 so then her aunt, she was living in a \u0152 a red brick house on top of the hill by sing \u0152 Saint Xavier\u2122s. Do you rig \u0152 do you know where Saint Xavier\u2122s is? Oh, well anyhow, it\u2122s on the other side of Latrobe up on \u0152 up on the highway. Well, it was, it burnt down there, they had a fire and they cli \u0152 that took care of that. So anyway, why \u0152 we go \u0152 we got out of that jo \u0152 well, anyway, well, Interview with Grant Shultheis October 8, 2010 48 what I did, my dad and mother\u2122s neighbor, he worked at Latrobe Steel. And I called him up. And I knew him and I told him who it was and I says, how\u2122s the chance of getting a job down Latrobe Steel? And he says, pretty good. And he says, I gotta go to Pittsburgh tomorrow, but he says, before I go down \u0152 go, I\u2122ll get the ball rolling, and you call me at six o\u2122 clock tomorrow night. Then I says, all right. So at six o\u2122clock the next night I called him and he says , where do you want to go to work, it\u2122s all set up for you. I says \u0152 I says, well, when\u2122s the next time that I can \u0152 when can I start? And he says, how about Monday? I said, good deal, because this is \u0152 I think this was Saturday whene \u0152 I called him. A-Anyway, I went. So I w \u0152 I went there on Monday and \u0152 and th-that\u2122 s when I started, and I worked there 35 years. I became a ham \u0152 a hammer driver. And we \u0152 boy, I\u2122ll tell you, I couldn\u2122t believe I made money so easy. Yeah, you k now. So, th-they \u0152 the first job I had the \u0152 was shoveling a \u0152 a load of gravel, spreading it out. Another guy and I, we went down and down and we got them shovels and we had this big pile of gravel there and we st \u0152 we s-spread it all out for a roadway there where \u0152 where it was they were making, and all we did was sit around the rest of the day waiting for someone to come out and get us. And they paid us fo r it. I couldn\u2122t believe it the \u0152 it was that way. So then that\u2122s when I was wishing I\u2122d started when I come home from work \u0152 from the army.
