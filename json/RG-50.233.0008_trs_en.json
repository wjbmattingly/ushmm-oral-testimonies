They finally did make it on their own, illegally across. Now when I came home from school that day I was told to be very quiet because somebody was sleeping in our house that came. I was not told then illegally because it was too dangerous for me to know. Later on I was told; I was 12 at that time. We learned and we knew what was happening. We also had many friends from Germany come to Prague and relatives who were already, before that, persecuted and escaped to Prague. Of course, they were caught, later on in Prague."

That\u2019s really the time we became aware of all that and were taken out of the German schools. There were riots in the streets and all that where we were caught once trying to get home from where we were. As Jews, we didn\u2019t even dare to cross or go near it.

We younger could not go, we only went daytime to the farms. Again this was at the time when we could no longer take public transportation. If there was a two-car train, we were permitted to take the last car and the platform of the last car to go to this work. We had a separate permission slip. If the train had only one car, we were not permitted at all. We had to be home before the curfew. This was before the transports started."

From the Jewish elders, you send out, at that time we still had young people working there with the notification, the name 5 of the transport and with that we had to go to the holding place which was an old exhibition hall emptied out called the Messacalanda.

I really am not sure but I know there was a way we could pack and again the youth organization we called that formed Helping Hand would send us out to the older people that couldn\u2019t carry and couldn\u2019t pack. We would pack for them. Like we had a way of packing the shoes to the side and the blankets. Since in Europe you had this old-style, heavy down-feather , it was called blankets, we established a sewing room where people could bring ahead of time in preparation for transports, their blankets. We would empty out the feathers, we would stitch it small and flat and restuff it with their feathers. That was called \u2014 we sort of established a room this size, a sewing room.

Later on I put together as I was telling you about the Zionist youth organization, due to them I think. (Male voice: Also the Germans wanted 5,000 and not 5,000 and one). That I put together later. There were four, (It was their choice whom they would take off). Right. Anyhow, 5,000 left. This is the transport, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with it, when they arrived in Auschwitz, they were kept together as famililager 9 Birkenau which is where I have the cards that I received which are upstairs too. He perished in that transport. He volunteered, he took my number, I found out later on, my transport number. Later on I also found out that there were 5,004 on this transport. They had said only 5,000 can be. So four were taken out. Since there were obviously four volunteers, one of which is my brother. (He went to be of help to your parents, thought he might be able to help them). I, in turn, was taken out due maybe to the influence of the Zionist youth organization. (Was their choice, their choice). Their choice to decide the four. (It was their choice to decide whom to send). I think also because from the last numbers and we were in the 4,500 category so that also was part of it."

A> Asa matter of fact, he received lumps of sugar for the horses. Every night they would get like after they were groomed and all that, a lump of sugar. At one point my mother was very sick and he tried to get the sugar, some of the lumps of sugar to her. But he was caught by one of the German policemen, not SS, German police that policed us. He was taken to the punishment center which was MA you might have heard that word, which was three miles out of Terezin, but was still part of Terezin. The artists of Terezin were taken there. Usually, everybody taken there was killed or tortured to death there. Nobody survived. But he came back to the camp about three days later but so brutally beaten and tortured that we hardly recognized him. In the three days. But the reason he came back, at that time we understood, he was needed for the horses. He was especially good with the horses. Some of the SS got him out but he looked terrible.

Five thousand Czechoslovakia Jews were shipped out of Terezin on September 7, 1943 to Auschwitz. My brother, working for the SS as their stable boy were brought back that call, they need him. He was protected from shipped out but when he learned that my parents and I are on that transport, he volunteered. He ran to the Jewish Elder and asked to be put into this transport and got a number and joined. As we were already boarding the cattle cars -- by then the trains came all the way into camp to the Hamburger Barrack, the Hamburger -- my parents were already in one car, my brother in another. I was boarding the cattle car on that ramp, the SS standing at the ramp, called out my number, pushed me aside."

Because that was the birthday of the first president of Czechoslovakia."

Actually, at that time, as far as I researched it and understood, out of the 5,000 that\u2019s also in the movie Shoah, I mentioned, only 2,800 were still alive. The others had perished due to starvation, sickness, beating, etc. My father and my brother had perished before."

At that time, as far as I researched it, I don\u2019t have documents which will be ready now I hope, I have to find out more, as far as I know, only my mother went into the gas on March 7. I was saved by being taken out and I found out much later that the transport was under roster 5,000. There were 5,004 on that list so four were taken off and I was one of the four. Possibly that, which I found out later, my brother might have taken my number."

They had to work, the ones that were able and the ones who died, died of either torture, malnutrition, sickness due to the malnutrition like we had dysentery, typhoid, and so on."

            "answer": "I stayed in the camp. I worked there. After that transport, after transports were leaving and again, due to the Zionist youth organization and the Jewish management that always had to put together the transport, they always were trying to keep some of us, the younger people behind. In Terezin, we still had a chance of survival but we knew once we are shipped out east, that there is hardly any chance left. Then they needed work for war production. War production and I was assigned to that war production which was a big barrack in Terezin, built outside the camp. About 6,000 people were assigned to that war production which was splitting that big rock of mica into very thin slivers which were used for filters in the gas masks for the German soldiers. The other work we had to do which also protected us at that time from being shipped out were building the gas chambers in Terezin."

But then when the death transports were coming back and we were unloading the trains of the dead bodies mostly, either there or someplace else, I don\u2019t know, I got typhoid. I ended up in the typhoid barracks. Typhoid 19 was contagious, the Germans had one barrack where all the typhoid cases were taken. I was in that barrack more or less unconscious when we were liberated."

But a friend of mine came to the typhoid barracks two days later, when I became conscious and she brought me a piece of, sort of a slice of white bread which the Russian army had brought in for us. Then I realized I must be free; then it all sank in."

I don\u2019t really remember. Then I remembered being carried by two sort of -- two guys, two inmates and this friend of mine who helped, carrying me to the typhoid barrack but I didn\u2019t realize where to. I just knew I\u2019m being carried but I don\u2019t know where. The next thing I knew when I regained consciousness, sort of, that she was there, this friend of mine who is now in Israel. We are still the closest of friends. We went through the whole camp together, we helped each other and we remained the closest of friends until now."

But again I couldn\u2019t leave Terezin because I had to be first -- we needed a repatriation card on which it stated that we were deloused and no longer a carrier of anything and so on which was set up by the Russians. Since Czechoslovakia, Prague, at that time was also under the Russians. I couldn\u2019t get that since I was still a typhoid carrier and I was too weak and too sick. But this friend of mine already was in Prague and on one of the trucks coming back to Terezin, it would take us about wherever we wanted to go, and she had sent a -- like an empty beer keg on that truck. Before we came into Prague to the border like the \u201cCheckpoint Charlie\u201d type, like a gate where you had to show that you are clear, you can enter the city."

About three months afterwards, he found my name in the paper in New York from the Red Cross list of survivors. I, in turn, knew his address and through a British soldier that came back to the Czech army, a friend of my brother\u2019s, through him, through the British army, through London, through his mother, I was able to send a wire to New York, to let him know that I survived. Actually out of my entire family, when I came back to Prague, out of my entire family, aunts, uncles, cousins, everybody, I was the only one that survived. Everybody else perished.
