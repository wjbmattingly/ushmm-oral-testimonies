And my mother, as I said, sold for them until she got married. And \u2014 and she\u2019d met my father on one of the trips, that he came \u2014 he went twice a year to see his mother and his siblings. And \u2014 and \u2014 and I guess they fell in love, and my mother\u2019s papers weren\u2019t ready to go to Germany, so they got married in Danzig, Gdansk. And then she \u2014 her two uncles escorted her there, and they had just a religious ceremony, they did not have the civilian one, so the uncles just whisked her back to Warsaw. And so their marriage wasn\u2019t consummated until she joined him about six weeks later in Berlin. And that was 1924, and \u2014 August 1924, and in October of \u201925, I was born.

So when, in 1926, there was a well known plastic surgeon, a Dr. Josef(ph), who had practiced medicine during the first World War, and some of his instruments were used throughout Europe. And she went there to have a \u2014 to have a \u2014 a nose job, because when she was a little girl, during the summer, and she was the youngest of nine, and she ran into a tree. And she had a prominent nose, I have my mother\u2019s nose, but she broke the nose, she had a bump on her \u2014 o-on her nose, so he said she should go there and have her nose done. And my mother would tell how she \u2014 when she went in there, there were young men with big ears, and they came out with little shells. And there women and men who went in with huge noses, and they came out with little s-snub noses. And women went in with humongous breasts, and came \u2014 they went in with brassieres and \u2014 and it was perfect. And my mother said her surgery was not a success. She remembered swallowing blood while they threw chocolate into her mouth. And professor Jusef(ph) wanted her to come back to do it over, and she said no, she would live with that. So, I have my mother\u2019s nose, and then in \u2014 when we were already in New York, I was 16 years old, and I wanted to have my nose done and my mother would say [speaks German], the nose isn\u2019t that important. And then when I got married and I suggested this to my husband, I said, I married you not because of your nose, and you don\u2019t have to \u2014 so, here I am. I have \u2014 my son has my nose."
