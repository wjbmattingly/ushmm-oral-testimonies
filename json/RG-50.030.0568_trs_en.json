And my mother, as I said, sold for them until she got married. And \u0152 and she\u2122d met my father on one of th e trips, that he came \u0152 he went twice a year to see his mother and his siblings. And \u0152 and \u0152 and I guess they fell in love, and my mother\u2122s papers weren\u2122t ready to go to Germany, so they got married in Danzig, Gdansk . And then she \u0152 her two uncles escorted her there, and they had just a religious ceremony, they did not ha ve the civilian one, so the uncles just whisked her back to Warsaw. And so their marriage wasn\u2122t consummated until she joined him about six weeks later in Berlin. And that was 1924, and \u0152 August 1924, and in October of \u212225, I was born.

And she went there to have a \u0152 to have a \u0152 a nose job, because when she was a little girl, during the summer, and she was the youngest of nine, and she ran into a tree. And she had a prominent nose, I have my mothe r\u2122s nose, but she broke the nose, she had a bump on her \u0152 o-on her nose, so he said she should go there and have her nose done. And my mother would tell how she \u0152 when she went in there, there were young men with big ears, and they came out with little shells. And there women and men who went in with huge noses, and they came out with little s-snub noses. And women went in with humongous breasts, and came \u0152 they went in with brassieres 6 and \u0152 and it was perfect. And my mother sa id her surgery was not a success. She remembered swallowing blood while they threw chocolate into her mouth. And professor Jusef(ph) wanted her to come back to do it over, and she said no, she would live with that. So, I have my mother\u2122s nose, and then in \u0152 when we were already in New York, I was 16 years old, and I wanted to have my nose done and my mother would say [speaks German] , the nose isn\u2122t that important. And then when I got married and I suggested this to my husband, I said, I married you not because of your nose, and you don\u2122t have to \u0152 so, here I am. I have \u0152 my son has my nose."
