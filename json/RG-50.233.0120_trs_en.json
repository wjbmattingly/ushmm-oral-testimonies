My mother did mot teach but both of them were civic leaders in town and I would like to bring out the fact that they were leaders not just for the Jewish community but for the entire town as well. What hurts so now in retrospect is that when we needed help no one extended a helping hand to us. Our neighbors and former so-called friends turned against us. My childhood was very, very happy. I know my father had five sisters and a mother who emigrated to America and he was in I guess, in the process of arranging for us to join them in the United States when the war broke out. I don\u2019t know why he was the last one to emigrate but I understand from -- also 1n retrospect that it was because these were women, sisters, and he decided he would take care of them first even though he was somehow in the middle. I don\u2019t know the actual chronological years but unfortunately we never made it. Ironically in 1939 he was offered two tickets, two invitations to the World\u2019s Fair in New York and he refused. He asked for four and of course they didn\u2019t give him four so we never did make it or he never made it. My childhood was very, very happy. I remember a big house. Our house was always filled with people. In those days or at that time we\u2019d have like meetings and concerts, poetry reading."

She played the piano, she played the violin beautifully and she continued. I played the piano but I really didn\u2019t give it any of my soul or anything. I liked to play and run around and just do the normal things."

            "question": "Around the town was there a lot of lakes and streams and things to play with?",
            "answer": "No, there was a river and I remember once, as a matter of fact on my fourth birthday there was a party and at that time, it\u2019s very hazy, but we did not live in a big house on the fashionable street. My father and I walked along the river, on the banks of the river and that river played a very important role in my life. I looked over to the other side and I said, Papa is that America on the other side and he tried to explain that it was not. There was one river. There were two ponds and there was a great big, it\u2019s not a forest -- what do you call -- like a park but filled with trees and all and that park or on the edge of the park lived a lady who owned an awful lot of land and she was the, like the (I don\u2019t know what you would call it -- the word escapes me now) but she was from nobility, Polish nobility and she was like a princess. And she lived, she was an old lady at that time; she only had some servants and all who tended her. But she lived right on the edge of that great big park and it was like a palace. And then we had like a mayor\u2019s house, the Starosta and all these people used to come to our house, the mayor, the Polish priest and the Ukrainian priest because our town was partly Polish and partly Ukrainian and partly Jewish. In our house everyone met on an even status and it was very interesting. I mean I took it for granted. My friends were Polish, Ukrainian, Jewish, and I really even though you\u2019re not asking me, I never felt any anti-Semitism in my childhood. There probably was some but I never felt it personally. And when I think of it now it was probably no small achievement that my father was a professor at a state university as a Jew and to me it was a given. That\u2019s the way it went on. My mother did an awful lot of philanthropic work in our town and I remember they organized camps in the summer time for needy children, Polish, Jewish, Ukrainian and there was always an awful lot of activity and it was a very happy home. I mean there were many things. You talk about being a tomboy. I was the bane of my sister\u2019s existence. She was four years older and I always wanted to do what she did. Of course she resented it. One time we had they call it a fretepian so it\u2019s not really a piano I guess but something like a piano in a salon, in the living room. One time I got hold of some paint and I painted the keys. I was punished for that but I did it so she wouldn\u2019t be able to play. Those are the things I remember from my childhood."

There were several different synagogues. There was a rabbi and that\u2019s it."

We observed all the holidays and that\u2019s another thing I remember. Once before Passover I was given a little Star of David and a gold chain and I lost the Star of David and there were about twenty people at the table and this is like a big dinner at Passover and everybody was made to crawl on the floor to find my little Star of David which they found. But I don\u2019t remember going to synagogue every Saturday. No, we didn\u2019t do that."

            "question": "Can you tell me a little bit about -- you know as much as you can remember -- about the invasion of Poland by the Germans in 1939?",
            "answer": "Well before the Germans invaded my town the Soviet Union took over because Poland was partitioned in two. The eastern part of Poland became the property of the Soviet Union and we fell into that category. So in 1939 when the war started September 1, 1939, the Russians came in. They came in with their tanks and with their soldiers."

            "question": "Did they come in on the first or did they come in a few weeks later?",
            "answer": "They came in maybe a week or so later and I remember long, long processions. At that time we lived in a big, big house on the main fashionable street. Litsa Miskawicha and I remember long hordes of refugees coming from the other part of Poland trying to get away from the Germans and we didn\u2019t understand what was going on. They came in with tanks and with soldiers but very little bloodshed. There was a lot of chaos but pretty soon things became again sort of normal. I personally did not realize what was going on. I knew there was a change of government. The emphasis in my life was that the language, the formal language became Russian instead of Polish. But again that was not much of a problem because in our area everyone was either bi or tri-lingual. It was a little difficult in the beginning. A lot of people lost their jobs and all. My father did not. They kept him on and he continued in Lvov. There was one change which I just realized a few days ago. He used to also teach in Kracow, I don\u2019t what do you call it, as a visiting professor and that stopped. Well it stopped obviously because the Germans took over. But other than that our life did not change that much."

            "answer": "We stayed in the same house. You see we were not materialistically, we were not rich or we were not -- I guess my family was part of the intellectual group in the town so our life has not changed much. This went on for not quite two years. Our schools didn\u2019t lose a beat. The only thing is that the official language changed into Russian."

            "answer": "Well you know what was happening and again this is all in retrospect which I didn\u2019t realize. Some people would disappear in the middle of the night and not be heard from again. And these were probably the people that they considered capitalists. These were business people who owned businesses. Yes, I guess the businesses changed hands so to speak and all of a sudden there was a shortage of one item, two items, three items. Yes, definitely, the whole picture of the town did change."

            "answer": "Well, I don\u2019t know. This was not discussed in front of me but I know my father had a fantastic library in his little office in our house and now and again they would have meetings and they closed the door. A lot of people would come, a lot of his students and they would talk and then I would never see them again. And then I found that a lot of them emigrated in a clandestine way illegally. And a lot of them ended up, many as a matter of fact, ended up in what is now Israel and some of them ended up in the United States. And some of them we never heard of again. But yes, there were many discussions and there were concerns."

            "answer": "Well, I guess going to synagogue was a little more -- I mean it became less frequent. It didn\u2019t affect any of my immediate friends so I am very hazy about it and I know that it was difficult and I know that they probably nationalized the businesses and all but from my own personal point of view I cannot relate to it too much."
        },

            "num": 29,
            "question": "You made mention about the synagogue. Was there a conscious effort by the authorities to discourage religious practices?",
            "answer": "I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sure it was but it was done in a very subtle way and I think my father was conscious of it and probably cognizant of it that he is not supposed to go to synagogue too often."

            "question": "You said he was allowed to go to Lvov. Do you remember if he was allowed to travel freely in that way back or forth?",
            "answer": "Yeah, he was traveling back and forth but I don\u2019t think we traveled anyplace else."
        },
        {
            "num": 31,
            "question": "Why don\u2019t you tell me a little bit about when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union?",
            "answer": "Well, that happened in the summer of 41. Again I guess Hitler and Stalin, or Hitler decided to break his agreement with Stalin and he started pursuing his evil plans by occupying the territories first of Poland and then going on to Russia. The Germans came, again it\u2019s almost like out of nowhere, again with tanks and their soldiers were much -- they were dressed sharp, they looked sharp. To me it was an event of change, but in a way exciting. It\u2019s hard to say that but it was. They came in and we didn\u2019t know what to expect. I know my parents were very depressed but they did not share these feelings with us openly. Again we saw a lot of refugees, as we call them now, people going with the Russians. Why we didn\u2019t do it, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very difficult to make decisions like these when you have a family, when you\u2019re on your own. I want to track back and I think that my father was an ardent Zionist and I think that we didn\u2019t go to America for two reasons and this is my conjecture. One, the authorities and the red tape was absolutely awful and took a long time and secondly my father\u2019s heart really didn\u2019t belong there and yet being a family man with two kids it was difficult for him to make a decision to do what he told his students to do and a lot of them did then. They went to Israel."

            "num": 32,
            "question": "Do you think he was advocating for many of them to leave?",
            "answer": "Oh, I know he did because we made a trip to Israel in 1985 (decade is unclear) or so and I met some of his students. They organized an evening to honor the memory of my parents, especially my father, their mentor, and they told me that."

            "answer": "Yes, they remembered me as a little pain in the neck. Yes, they did. And I remembered some of them. Yes, my father was really an ardent Zionist. I didn\u2019t realize then, I didn\u2019t know that."

            "num": 34,

            "answer": "No, I know he was preoccupied with education and all. He had a number of doctorates from different places and that was his life. But the rest of it, no, I did not know. He was a wonderful father, he was very stern. There was discipline. We did not speak at the table until he spoke. But that was all right, we didn\u2019t know any different so that was okay. I think I digressed from something that you asked."

            "question": "No, that\u2019s okay. We can get back to it. I\u2019ve got a couple of other questions but I wanted to step back just a little bit. I asked you about the invasion, the German invasion, but I wanted to step back just a little bit if I could. Before when we talked about how your father had discussions with students and other people about Germans, the Nazis coming to power and that kind of thing.",
            "answer": "Yes, I think so because there were all sorts of newspapers and the radios and the political situation was discussed constantly."

Do you remember if your father was concerned about that?",
            "answer": "I don\u2019t know. I think he was always concerned with the world situation and they always, I mean at these discussions and these gatherings political situations were always discussed whether it was a concert or poetry reading or so but yes it was always discussed."

In the very beginning, I don\u2019t know if it was the same day they marched in or the next day, all the Jews, right away they zeroed in on the Jews, we had to meet at the marketplace and right away they started with their decrees to strip us of all material possessions slowly but very systematically. The first request was for the Jews to give all the gold, maybe all the silver, all the radios, everything that had any material value, carpets, Persian carpets, you wouldn\u2019t imagine, furs, fur coats, all sorts of things we had to bring to the marketplace, or whatever, I think it was the marketplace, the Germans took that. And that went on for about a week. Then they went around with a list of people which tells me that the local inhabitants had to give them that list."

I don\u2019t recall but every day since the Germans came in was just like a nightmare in the beginning and that was not even the real nightmare. But that\u2019s the way I lost my father. They came in. He saw them; he tried to run out through the kitchen, through the back way and they were in the back there with the Ukrainians and they grabbed him and that was that. The rumor had it that these people, the leaders of our community were taken away and sent to Dachau. Now I find out that there was a big question mark. Some people told me that it\u2019s probable that they were all executed right there and there\u2019s supposed to be a mass grave which I never got to see upon my return trip in 1988. Or some of them did go to Dachau. I searched in Dachau for any sign, lists and all. I could not find anything and I still to this day, I do not know how or when my father died. After they took away the leaders of our town which was a very organized plan to just cause chaos and confusion once the leaders were gone. Then they, I don\u2019t know the sequence, the chronological sequence, but they burnt all our synagogues and they gathered, we had to be there to watch it, every Jewish person."

Everyone who was fourteen years or older was ordered to work. In the morning they would gather in a certain place, my sister and my mother. I mean it was such a stupid, useless....most of the work was useless. My mother was digging ditches and things like that. My sister at that point was also digging ditches. Then, after a little while, every day there were different decrees and different orders, loudspeakers. Before the ghetto was organized, one day a van pulled up in front of our house and several Germans came out and they came up to the house and asked where my father\u2019s library was and my father had a rare collection of first edition books and I mean that was his life\u2019s hobby (all the little money we had I think he spent on the rare books) and they knew about it.

That day no work.

I mean not much because we were not a family that was very materialistic. But she sewed into our clothing and to each my sister and myself and her own clothing some of the jewelry into the linings. She said you never know. This is for a rainy day. And so we grabbed the clothing, the coats and whatever. I don\u2019t remember what else we grabbed but some pillows and blankets and we went to the marketplace."

            "question": "And that was in the center of the town?",
            "answer": "Yes, and there we were marched into a very poor section of the city, of the little town and we were assigned a place to live. Our place was one room and we shared it with three other families. Mostly there were women and older men because the leaders were taken away, about three hundred of them or so. And that\u2019s the way the ghetto was formed. The ghetto was surrounded by a high fence that was finished off with barbed wire and there were two gates, one in the front and one in the back. Everyone who entered had to have a written permit. In the morning the people who worked were marched out and they were marched back in in the evening. The place was guarded by Ukrainian militia. There were very few Germans in the ghetto. They were on the outside mostly. That\u2019s when our nightmare really began. The rations were very meager but if on didn\u2019t work, there was no ration. So I did not receive a ration and my mother and my sister had to share. I mean they didn\u2019t have to but they shared their rations with me. In the beginning people still managed not to give all their material possessions to the Germans so there were some opportunities to barter on the outside and bring in some milk and bread and what have you. And that\u2019s the way we survived. My mother and a few other of the women organized a clandestine school for children like myself because we were really left with no supervision and nothing to do and they managed to get some school supplies from the outside by trading rings or gold or whatever people had. So for a while we had a wonderful school in the evening in the ghetto. We, I mean kids, really looked forward to it. They read books and we sang songs and we colored and did all sorts of little stupid things just to occupy our minds but it was very good for us. But it did not last very long. After a few months that sort of dissipated and it disappeared because people didn\u2019t have any more to trade for supplies plus the fact that winter set in and there was a lot of cold and illness and starvation and mostly everyone was just concentrating on being able to survive. In the ghetto we were ordered to wear a Star of David, a yellow patch, on the front of our clothing and on the back of our clothing. Even within the ghetto you couldn\u2019t move without having that patch. It was a very difficult thing and even as young as I was I realized that we were separated from the rest of humankind because we were different. We were not as good as anybody else. And that\u2019s a very demoralizing thing to live with. Most of all I think we were preoccupied with being hungry. Hunger is something very hard to describe. It\u2019s so paradoxical now. Everyone is on diets and we say we mustn\u2019t eat so much, cholesterol, what have you. But real hunger is so painful. It absorbs or it takes over your entire being. I don\u2019t remember what I ate yesterday but those years are etched in my memory. They were indelible. I remember I was so hungry that I would do anything to get something to eat. So many times even though I promised my mother I wouldn\u2019t do it, I would sneak out of the ghetto."

            "answer": "Many of the children did it because my age or even younger, the ones who didn\u2019t work, there was nothing to do all day long and all you could think of is how hungry you were. And so we did. We had an ingenious, as a matter of fact two places in the ghetto where we dug holes and camouflaged them and that was not through the gates so we would go out, sneak out and try and beg or barter for some food and then we\u2019d go back the same way. It was difficult and we were very obvious. We were recognized that we were not the same as the people on the outside because our clothing and we were dirty and we were unkempt and all that but we didn\u2019t care, we were so hungry. And some people on the outside, I say the outside, the Ukrainians and the Poles were good to us. Others were not. If you were caught on the outside it was punishable by death. I did it a lot of times and I was not caught. I\u2019d bring an egg home to share with my family. I would bring a slice of bread or something like that. One time I did go out and I managed to get two eggs for a little ring and I got it out of my clothing and I was getting back and I was almost at the place where I would crawl in the hole and get back and this Ukrainian militia man caught me. He started yelling at me and he searched me. I had a dress with puff sleeves and I put one here and one in here. He found the eggs and he threw them on the sidewalk and made me kneel down and rub my face in the eggs and screamed at me and said get back where you belong and I don\u2019t want to hear from you anymore, I don\u2019t want to see you anymore. So I guess he was a gentle person because he could have killed me. He didn\u2019t. But I didn\u2019t give away the hiding place either. He marched me to the gate and pushed me in and that was it. I had scrapes on my face and whatever but that didn\u2019t count. A few days later as a matter of fact a dear friend of mine, she was about eleven a little older than I at that point, and she went out and she got a loaf of bread and she never made it back to the ghetto and they shot her right on the spot and they dragged her body right into the ghetto and they wouldn\u2019t allow the burial committee, because they had a committee for that, they wouldn\u2019t allow them to bury her for a week."

So I went there and they showed me where her seat was, the bench and I don\u2019t even remember what she was knitting. It wasn\u2019t crocheting, it was knitting, a scarf or a sweater. No, it couldn\u2019t have been a sweater because I wouldn\u2019t know how to do that but a scarf I did know and that was it. And I started knitting and all of a sudden I felt someone was looking at me, watching me and there was this mean looking German going around and just looking. And he stood behind me for a while and observed me and apparently I wasn\u2019t doing it fast enough or whatever and he got very angry with me. He started screaming dunner vetter and started cursing. And I didn\u2019t answer. I kept doing what I was doing. Finally I didn\u2019t please him obviously. He grabbed the needles out of my hand and stuck one of them in my finger and this is what it is now. I passed out and that was my experience taking my sister\u2019s place. In the beginning of the ghetto there was like a little hospital. And there was still one doctor left. And I remember his name, Dr. Grossfeld. He tried to do his best to help people but that again didn\u2019t last long. Pretty soon there was no more hospital, there were no more supplies and he disappeared. That\u2019s another thing that was happening in the ghetto. Every now and then at no specific time for no reason obviously a van would come or a big truck and they would grab people just...."

Dr, Grossfeld disappeared in one of those actions where they would come and just grab people indiscriminately. That\u2019s why there was also such a demoralizing feeling. One never knew, I never knew if I would see my mother and my sister again because these actions could occur during work or after work or before work or anytime.

He was taken. Well, my mother was really in retrospect when I think of it a phenomenal person. She never let us give up hope. She would always talk about plans -- how we would celebrate when Daddy came home. I didn\u2019t think it was that unusual but she turned gray overnight when they took my father away. Overnight. She woke up -- she was completely gray. I guess she knew deep in her soul that my father never would come back. Yet she wouldn\u2019t let us give up hope. It was a very difficult time. But again when I look at it from today\u2019s perspective it wasn\u2019t so bad for me because I still had my mother and my sister. At that point their love and our caring for each other compensated for all the physical atrocities, and they were atrocities. We were cold; we were hungry; we were not well; we were uncertain of out tomorrow. It was almost as if you lived in suspension from day to day. And that\u2019s the way we coped. It was really terrible when you think of coming from a fairly advanced civilized life to living in one room with three other families, sharing the whole house, that was a big -- I think a three story house, we share one bathroom and one kitchen for the entire house."

What happened was that they decided our numbers had dwindled and they didn\u2019t need such a spacious place as we had there and they moved us to a smaller ghetto and that was really one of the shabbiest parts of town. Nobody lived there for years. However there was one redeeming feature in that new ghetto. It was again surrounded by high fence and barbed wire and all these goodies. But one side of the ghetto was right next to the river and our assigned place to live was in the little shack right on the river and that was not fenced in. It was really even worse and smaller than the place we lived before but it was on the river and it was important to us."

            "question": "Why was that important?",
            "answer": "Because it was open and it wasn\u2019t guarded. My mother was rather happy with that. When we moved we were again with different people and again there wasn\u2019t enough room to sleep us all on the floor so we had to build like bunks so there were three in a row stacked up. And then life went on again the way it was before except that there was much more chaos and people became more panicky and even though we had no outside knowledge of what was going on, no radio, no newspaper, no mail, we were completely cut off from the world, the people who were going out to work would gather some information, rumors from the outside. Somehow rumors begin to float in the ghetto that they were going to kill us all soon. There were also visible signs. There were more Ukrainian militia in the ghetto and there were more Germans within the ghetto, too. They would just march around with their high boots, all dressed up and spit when they\u2019d see you and make you walk on the road not on the sidewalk. And then my mother apparently, I don\u2019t know if she started earlier, but that\u2019s when she shared it with my sister and me, that she started looking for some places where we could hide. For a long time she said she couldn\u2019t find, make any connection on the outside. Finally one day in the spring she came back and she was very excited. And she said she found two places. She couldn\u2019t find one hiding place for three but she found two. One farmer was willing to take two people, obviously for money and another one was willing to take one. And there was her Solomon\u2019s decision -- who will go where. Well my mother decided since my sister was four years older than I she could manage by herself and my mother and I would go to the second place. The farmer who agreed to hide my mother and me was known to us. He was on the other side of the river and before the war my mother would get, many times she would get dairy products, milk and cheese and butter from this farmer\u2019s place and it sounded very logical to me. How she did connect with them I don\u2019t know but she did. She was not happy but she was satisfied that she was able to accomplish that. And we just waited for the time that she would say when we should do it. And that time came in early August."

They were coming and going and it was evident that something was going on. So about a week, I don\u2019t know exactly, but about a week after my sister left she came home one day from work and we ate our meager supper and she told me to put on two of everything that I had the best which wasn\u2019t that much left. I remember I had some high top shoes that you don\u2019t wear in the summertime but she said put them on. She packed a little bundle of stuff for herself and a bundle for me.

But by morning a lot of other people kept going into the river and by that time machine guns were going full blast all the time. There were these screams and shouts by the Ukrainian militiamen and this is something I can\u2019t get rid of that sound and of that phrase and they kept screaming; village ???? Meaning crawl out Jew, I can see you. Most of the people came out. We didn\u2019t. We stayed there. That lasted a whole day and by night when night fell the machine guns were going full blast. We couldn\u2019t move. And so we stayed there. I remember my mother gave me that soggy bread that she packed and it tasted awful and she made me eat it. She said I needed the strength. We spent another night in the water and the next morning there was fire and there were screams and I heard babies crying and I guess the time they were liquidating the ghetto. I can\u2019t say the water turned red but it should have because the machine guns were going again full blast all the time and we stayed in that river. I kept dozing off and I know we stayed in the river for a number of days but I don\u2019t know exactly how many days. But one moment I opened my eyes and my mother was gone and I really became panic stricken and I tried to rationalize that I probably fell asleep and she had to make her way to the farmer\u2019s place and I would have to find my way there by myself to join her. And then all of a sudden everything got quiet. There was no movement, nothing. And I stayed until dark and then I made my way across the river and I walked. I remember walking, walking for so long until I came to the farmer\u2019s place, to the barn. I\u2019m sure I must have been a sight, dirty and wet and the dogs started barking and the farmer came out. It was just beginning to -- daylight wasn\u2019t -- I mean it was dawn and he came out in his coveralls and I asked him if my mother was there, He said no. I said well I'll wait until she comes. He said what do you mean you\u2019ll wait, you will not wait here. I said you did agree to keep us here for a time, I didn\u2019t know for how long. He said well, I changed my mind. It\u2019s too dangerous. I said well, just let me stay until my mother comes. He said you can stay the day, Ill give you something to eat and at night when it gets dark you better leave or I'll report you to the authorities. And I was just bewildered at that point but it was very ironic because I noticed he wore my father\u2019s gold pocket watch with the coveralls"

            "answer": "I\u2019m sure that was part of it, I\u2019m sure. But his wife gave me some soup and some food. I wasn\u2019t even hungry at that point. I stayed in the barn until it got dark and they gave me some bread and an apple. I remember and they told me to leave. And I was so I guess bewildered and really panic stricken. I didn\u2019t think straight and I walked on the main street of that village. Anybody could have seen me or caught me but I was lucky. God was with me I guess if there is a God. And I walked all the way on the main street of that village until I came to an open field where we lived. It\u2019s agrarian, it\u2019s the breadbasket actually of Ukraine so there were these lush wheat fields and I spent the next two days in a field just sitting there like in a stupor. By that time the bread was gone and the apple was gone and I just didn\u2019t know what to do and my mind refused to give up. I felt, I don\u2019t know how to say it, but I felt as if I had let my mother down, that I dozed off if she had to leave me and now he\u2019s looking for someplace for me because he refused to give us protection. And so I decided then that my only way to live or to survive is to find my mother and I felt that I have to go and look for her. Our area has many forests so I decided then and there -- it was still early fall -- that I have to go from forest to forest until I find her. And that\u2019s where my odyssey really starts. I started going from forest to forest and I walked and walked and the illusion when you look at something -- I mean my geography wasn\u2019t any good but I soon learned south and north and east and west. You look at a forest and it seems it\u2019s so close and you walk and you walk and it\u2019s not there. I walked all night and I tried to rest in the daytime. But meanwhile I needed to eat, too. So I would try to go to little villages in the outskirts and grab something from a garden or something and that\u2019s the way I survived the first months. The first months were also -- several things happened that were horrible. In the very beginning I would come across stragglers like myself from different ghettos because apparently Hitler liquidated all the ghettos in our area about the same time. I would find other people in the forests who were in similar situations. They were looking for their loved ones, they were looking for friends or whatever. And so I tried to get information about my family. Nobody knew anything and I didn\u2019t know anything about theirs. One time we were on the edge of a forest and there were seven of us from different places. There was a mother and a baby and two boys and two women. Anyway there were six other people and we were sitting and trying to get information from one another. And all of a sudden a bunch of kids from the neighboring village spotted us and they started yelling at us. \u201cJews, Jews.\u201d There was remuneration for reporting a Jew, however small it was. And they ran back to the village and we realized that soon somebody\u2019s going to come after us. We were sitting on the edge of a forest. This was -- there are different kinds of forest -- this one had very little underbrush. There was no place to hide except climbing up a tree which wasn\u2019t the smartest thing to do. But there were huge haystacks in the field so we ran to hide in the haystacks and somehow for an unexplainable reason we all ended up in the same haystack, all seven of us. I don\u2019t know what the haystack looked like on the outside but I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t very difficult for them to realize where we were. Pretty soon we heard voices of the villagers and the kids and they came back, they came there with pitchforks. They just made a game of it and they kept pushing the pitchforks into the haystacks. That went on for hours it seems like. It was in the afternoon, late afternoon. And pretty soon it was quiet and I heard a lot of commotion around me. And when it got real quiet I waited, I think it was the middle of the night when I crawled out."

Baby was on the chest of the mother and I was the only one who survived that massacre. I don\u2019t know why or how. I don\u2019t know, maybe I was in the middle, I don\u2019t know. And I stayed there for a while. I didn\u2019t even cover them with leaves or anything. I just walked away. There were many incidents like these. And this went on for three years. The winters were very difficult because it was not only hunger and thirst, it was cold. And the snow, footprints would show in the snow. Dogs would give you away if you go close to a village or to a barn. I tried, in the winter I tried to go from barn to barn and to keep warm or I would crawl in, they have these, they were not haystacks but where they kept, where the peasants keep the potatoes. It\u2019s like...."

            "answer": "Something like that. It was just awful. It was not only the hunger and the cold. It was being alone and sometimes not hearing a human voice for weeks at a time. It got so many times where I just didn\u2019t even care but I kept getting my strength from the fact that I had to find my mother. I never found her. And then apparently I got very sick and I was like in a little grave covered with leaves in the forest and the Russian soldiers found me there. I don\u2019t know how long I was there and they took me to some hospitals and they nursed me back to health. My quest, my search for my mother continued and when the war was over I went back to my home town. I found that there was one other person who survived. She was an older woman. As a matter of fact she is here in America. She lives in Duluth, Minnesota. And other than that there were no other survivors. I mean there were people who made their way illegally during the war but the survivors from the ghetto were just myself and this other woman. And when I got back to my hometown I didn\u2019t learn much except that somebody denounced my sister and they tortured her and they humiliated her. They paraded her on the main street in the nude and then they murdered her. And that must have happened very shortly after she left. I never found out what happened to my mother and I don\u2019t know for sure what happened to my father. You know the horrible feeling -- there is nothing tangible for me to mourn. When someone dies you have a cemetery, you can go and put some flowers and say a prayer. I have nothing. And to this day it seems, I know it\u2019s ridiculous but when I walk and when I see someone -- my father was about 6\u00b04\u201d and my mother was almost 6 foot tall --and when I see someone of the build and height, people remind me of my parents. I have to run in front of them ad look back to see it\u2019s not them. And then I made my way. I kept still looking for my mother and everybody said all survivors or people who survived are going to Germany. So illegally from what became the Soviet Union again I went through Bratislava and Vienna to Germany. That\u2019s the way all the survivors went. When we came to Germany there were lots of people, all sorts of people there. The ironic thing was that these people were survivors like myself, the remnants. And there were people who were running from the consequences of their collaborating with the Germans and so we all ended up in the same DP camps and that was very, very difficult. But finally they did separate us. And then even though we, as a survivor and as an orphan at that point, I still had to wait three years."

He was called back into the service and guess where his first assignment 1s?"

            "answer": "That\u2019s right, you\u2019re right. And I refused to go until I became a citizen, an American citizen. And then I went back and it was difficult. That\u2019s my life in a nutshell. For many years I didn\u2019t speak out. I told my husband, I told my son but my family, the few who were still alive didn\u2019t want to hear about it. And it was difficult for me to talk about it so I didn\u2019t. But then in 1983 there was a gathering here in Washington and I went to that gathering and something in me, I just sort of awoke and I said I\u2019m ready; I have to tell my story. I have a mandate. I felt as if I have a mandate to speak for all these and I call them martyrs not victims who never had a chance. And I\u2019m their spokesperson. I have to speak out and tell the story because I don\u2019t want the world to forget. And yet I sometimes, I haven\u2019t done it in recent months, but I was speaking at the Capital Children\u2019s Museum about a year ago and there was a class of -- I think -- fourth graders which is quite young and you speak in not very severe terms to children that age. But they came with several chaperones and one of the fathers who was a chaperone came over to me after my presentation and he says Mrs. Skiff....I says Schiff -- yes, Mrs. Schiff come on, admit, it\u2019s all a figment of your imagination. So that\u2019s where we are today. And I feel, I mean that I do have a mission and I try. It\u2019s not getting any easier for me but I feel that I do have to do it. I have to tell people what happened and maybe we\u2019|l learn something from our past. But apparently we haven\u2019t learned very much. Look what\u2019s going on in Bosnia. Look what\u2019s going on in Somalia, Sudan, the Soviet Union. People are hungry for power and there\u2019s so much hate in this world. I don\u2019t know how we can get rid of it -- intolerance, hate, I don\u2019t know. So this is my dilemma, what I have to live with. Do you have any questions?"

I know that my father had several doctorates from Switzerland, from the Sorbonne and I\u2019m not sure about Heidelberg but I mean I know he had several advanced degrees from different places. What was puzzling to me then I understand now. None of them were from Poland. In Poland apparently there was a quota and he had to go elsewhere to get his education.

And then it was sort of like an afterthought he said well whatever they did to the town, the ghettos were erased apparently I don\u2019t know I haven\u2019t seen it now, but he said at least the river, you\u2019ll show me the river which was so important in your life. Guess what? They diverted the river. When I asked I said I want to show my husband the river they said no more river, no more river.

They never had the heart to ask me because here haystacks are pretty small and there they do different kinds but these haystacks were so huge they were almost like a barn, so big. He says now I understand. I never had the heart to ask you how could seven people hide in a haystack. That\u2019s about it."
