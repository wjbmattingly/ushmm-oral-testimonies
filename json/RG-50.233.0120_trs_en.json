There probably was some but I never felt it personally. And when I think of it now it was probably no small achievement that my father was a professor at a state university as a Jew and to me it was a given. That\u2122s the way it went on. My mother did an awful lot of philanthr opic work in our town and I remember they organized camps in the summer time for nee dy children, Polish, Jewish, Ukrainian and there was always an awful lot of activity and it was a very happy home. I mean there were many things. You talk about being a tomboy. I was the bane of my sister\u2122s ex istence. She was four years older and I always wanted to do what she did. Of course she resented it. One time we had they call it a fretepian so it\u2122s not really a piano I guess but something like a piano in a salon, in the living room. One time I got hold of some pa int and I painted the keys. I was punished for that but I did it so she wouldn\u2122t be able to pl ay. Those are the things I remember from my childhood. ",

The eastern part of Poland b ecame the property of the Soviet Union and we fell into that category. So in 1939 when the war started September 1, 1939, the Russians came in.

Litsa Miskawicha and I remember long hordes of refugees coming from the other part of Poland trying to get away from the Germans and we didn\u2122t understand what was going on. They came in with tanks a nd with soldiers but very little bloodshed. There was a lot of chaos but pretty soon things became again sort of normal. I personally did not realize what was going on. I knew there was a change of government. The emphasis in my life was that the language, the formal language became Russian instead of Polish. But again that was not much of a problem because in our area everyone was either bi or tri-lingual. It was a little difficult in the beginning. A lot of people lost their jobs and all. My father did not. Th ey kept him on and he continued in Lvov. There was one change which I just realized a few days ago. He used to also teach in Kracow, I don\u2122t what do you call it, as a visiting professor and that stopped. Well it stopped obviously because the Germans took over. But other than th at our life did not change that much."

Agai n I guess Hitler and Stalin, or Hitler decided to break his agreement with Stalin and he st arted pursuing his evil plans by occupying the territories first of Poland and then going on to Russia. The Germans came, again it\u2122s almost like out of nowhere, again with tanks and their soldiers were much -- they were dressed sharp, they looked sharp. To me it was an event of change , but in a way exciting. It\u2122s hard to say that but it was. They came in and we didn\u2122t know wh at to expect. I know my parents were very depressed but they did not share these feelings wi th us openly. Again we saw a lot of refugees, as we call them now, people going with the Ru ssians. Why we didn\u2122t do it, I don\u2122t know. I\u2122m sure it\u2122s very difficult to make decisions like these when you have a family, when you\u2122re on your own. I want to track back and I think that my father was an ardent Zionist and I think that we didn\u2122t go to America for two reasons and this is my conjecture. One, the authorities and the red tape was absolutely awful and took a long time and secondly my father\u2122s heart really didn\u2122t belong there and yet being a family man with two kids it was difficult for him to make a decision to do what he told his students to do and a lot of them did then.

The first request was for the Jews to give all the gold, maybe all the silver, all the radios, everything that had a ny material value, carpe ts, Persian carpets, you wouldn\u2122t imagine, furs, fur coats, all sorts of things we had to bring to the marketplace, or whatever, I think it was the marketplace, the Germ ans took that.

I don\u2122t r ecall but every day since the Germans came in was just like a nightmare in the beginning and th at was not even the real nightmare. But that\u2122s the way I lost my father. They came in. He saw them; he tried to run out through the kitchen, through the back way and they were in the back there with the Ukrainians and they grabbed him and that was that. The rumor had it that these people, the leaders of our community were taken away and sent to Dachau. Now I find out that there was a big question mark. Some people told me that it\u2122s probable that they were all execute d right there and there\u2122s supposed to be a mass grave which I never got to see upon my return trip in 1988. Or some of them did go to Dachau. I searched in Dachau for any sign, lists and all. I could not find anything and I still to this day, I do not know how or when my father died. After they took away the leaders of our town which was a very organized plan to just cause chaos and confusion once the leaders were gone. Then they, I don\u2122t know the sequence, the chronological sequence, but they burnt all our synagogues and they gathered, we had to be there to watch it, every Jewish person."

            "answer": "Yes, and there we were marched into a very poo r section of the city, of the little town and we were assigned a place to live. Our place was one room and we shared it with three other families. Mostly there were women and older men because the leaders were taken away, about three hundred of them or so. And that\u2122s th e way the ghetto was formed. The ghetto was surrounded by a high fence that was finished off with barbed wire and there were two gates, one in the front and one in the back. Everyone who entered had to have a written permit. In the morning the people who worked were marched out and they were marched back in in the evening. The place was guarded by Ukrainian mili tia. There were very few Germans in the ghetto. They were on the outside mostly. That\u2122s when our nightmare really began. The rations were very meager but if on didn\u2122t work, there was no ration. So I did not receive a ration and my mother and my sister had to share. I mean they didn\u2122t have to but they shared their rations with me. In the beginning people still managed not to give all their material possessions to the Germans so there were some opportu nities to barter on the outside and bring in some milk and bread and what have you. And that\u2122s the way we survived. My mother and a few other of the women organized a clandestine school for children like myself because we were really left with no supervision and nothing to do and they mana ged to get some school supplies from the outside by trading rings or gold or whatever people had. So for a while we had a wonderful school in the evening in the ghetto. We, I mean kids, really looked forward to it. They read books and we sang songs and we colored and did all sorts of little stupid things just to occupy our minds but it was very good for us. But it did not last very long. After a few months that sort of dissipated and it disappeared because people didn\u2122t have any more to trade for supplies plus the fact that winter set in and there was a lot of cold and illness and starvation and mostly everyone was just concentrating on being able to survive. In the ghetto we were ordered to wear a Star of David, a yellow patch, on the front of our clothing and on the back of our clothing. Even within the ghetto you couldn\u2122t m ove without having that patch. It was a very difficult thing and even as young as I was I reali zed that we were separated from the rest of humankind because we were different. We were not as good as anybody else. And that\u2122s a very demoralizing thing to live with. Most of all I think we were preoccupied with being hungry. Hunger is something very hard to describe. It \u2122s so paradoxical now. Everyone is on diets and we say we mustn\u2122t eat so much, cholesterol, what have you. But real hunger is so painful. It absorbs or it takes over your entire being. I don\u2122t remember what I ate yesterday but those years are etched in my memory. They were inde lible. I remember I was so hungry that I would do anything to get something to eat. So ma ny times even though I promised my mother I wouldn\u2122t do it, I would sneak out of the ghetto."

            "answer": "Many of the children did it because my age or even younger, the ones who didn\u2122t work, there was nothing to do all day long and all you could think of is how hungry you were. And so we did. We had an ingenious, as a matter of fact two places in the ghetto where we dug holes and camouflaged them and that was not through the gates so we would go out, sneak out and try and beg or barter for some food and th en we\u2122d go back the same way. It was difficult and we were very obvious. We were recognized that we we re not the same as the people on the outside because our clothing and we were dirty and we were unkempt and all that but we didn\u2122t care, we were so hungry. And some people on the outs ide, I say the outside, the Ukrainians and the Poles were good to us. Others were not. If you were caught on the outside it was punishable by death. I did it a lot of times and I was not caugh t. I\u2122d bring an egg home to share with my family. I would bring a slice of bread or so mething like that. One time I did go out and I managed to get two eggs for a little ring and I got it out of my clothing and I was getting back and I was almost at the place where I would crawl in the hole and get back and this Ukrainian militia man caught me. He started yelling at me and he searched me. I had a dress with puff sleeves and I put one here and one in here. He found the eggs and he threw them on the sidewalk and made me kneel down and rub my face in the eggs and screamed at me and said get back where you belong and I don\u2122t want to hear from you anymore, I don\u2122t want to see you anymore. So I guess he was a gentle person because he could have killed me. He didn\u2122t. But I didn\u2122t give away the hiding place either. He marched me to the gate and pushed me in and that was it. I had scrapes on my face and whatever but that didn\u2122t count. A few days later as a matter of fact a dear friend of mine, she was about eleven a little older than I at that point, and she went out and she got a loaf of bread and she never made it back to the ghetto and they shot her right on the spot and they dragged her body right into the ghetto and they wouldn\u2122t allow the burial committee, because they had a committ ee for that, they wouldn\u2122t allow them to bury her for a week."

So I went there and they showed me where her seat was, the bench and I don\u2122t even remember what she was kn itting. It wasn\u2122t croc heting, it was knitting, a scarf or a sweater. No, it couldn\u2122t have been a sweater because I wouldn\u2122t know how to do that but a scarf I did know and that was it. And I st arted knitting and all of a sudden I felt someone was looking at me, watching me and there was th is mean looking German going around and just looking. And he stood behind me for a while and observed me and apparently I wasn\u2122t doing it fast enough or whatever and he got very angry with me. He started screaming dunner vetter and started cursing. And I didn\u2122t answer. I kept do ing what I was doing. Finally I didn\u2122t please him obviously. He grabbed the needles out of my hand and stuck one of them in my finger and this is what it is now. I passed out and that was my experience taking my sister\u2122s place. In the beginning of the ghetto there was like a little hosp ital. And there was stil l one doctor left. And I remember his name, Dr. Grossfeld. He tried to do his best to help people but that again didn\u2122t last long. Pretty soon there was no more hospital, there were no more supplies and he disappeared. That\u2122s another thing that was happening in the ghetto. Every now and then at no specific time for no reason obviously a van would come or a big truck and they would grab people just\u2013."

Dr, Grossfeld disappeared in one of those actions where they would come and just grab people indiscriminately. That\u2122s why there was also such a demoralizing feeling.

She would always talk about plans -- how we would celebrate when Daddy came home. I didn\u2122t think it was that unusual but she turned gray overnight when they took my father away. Overnight. She woke up -- she was comple tely gray. I guess she knew deep in her soul that my father never would come back. Yet sh e wouldn\u2122t let us give up hope. It was a very difficult time. But again when I look at it fr om today\u2122s perspective it wasn\u2122t so bad for me because I still had my mother and my sister. At that point their love and our caring for each other compensated for all the physical atrocities, and they were atrocities. We were cold; we were hungry; we were not well; we were uncertain of out tomorrow. It was almost as if you lived in suspension from day to day. And that\u2122s the way we coped. It was really terrible when you think of coming from a fairly advanced civilized life to living in one room with three other families, sharing the whole house, that was a big -- I think a three story house, we share one bathroom and one kitchen for the entire house."

What happened was that they decided our numbers had dwindled a nd they didn\u2122t need such a spacious place as we had there and they moved us to a smaller ghetto and that was really one of the shabbiest parts of town. Nobody lived there for years. However there was one redeeming feature in that new ghetto. It was again surrounded by high fence and barbed wire and all these goodies. But one side of the ghetto was right next to the river and our assigned place to live was in the little shack right on the river and that was not fenced in. It was really even worse and smaller than the place we lived before but it was on the river and it was important to us."

            "question": "Why was that important?",
            "answer": "Because it was open and it wasn\u2122t guarded. My mother was rather happy with that. When we moved we were again with different people and ag ain there wasn\u2122t enough room to sleep us all on the floor so we had to build like bunks so there were three in a row stacked up. And then life went on again the way it was before except that there was much more chaos and people became more panicky and even though we had no outside knowledge of what was going on, no radio, no newspaper, no mail, we were completely cut off from the world, the people who were going out to work would gather some information, ru mors from the outside. Somehow rumors begin to float in the ghetto that they were going to kill us all soon. There we re also visible signs. There were more Ukrainian militia in the ghetto and there were more Germans within the ghetto, too. They would just march around with their high boots, all dressed up and spit when they\u2122d see you and make you walk on the road not on the sidewalk. And then my mother apparently, I don\u2122t know if she started earlier, but that\u2122s when she shared it with my sister and me, that she started looking for some places wher e we could hide. For a long time she said she couldn\u2122t find, make any connection on the outside. Finally one day in the spring she came back and she was very excited. And she said sh e found two places. She couldn\u2122t find one hiding place for three but she found two. One farmer wa s willing to take two people, obviously for money and another one was willing to take one. And there was her Solomon\u2122s decision -- who will go where. Well my mother decided since my sister was four years older than I she could manage by herself and my mother and I would go to the second place. The farmer who agreed to hide my mother and me was known to us. He was on the other side of the river and before the war my mother would get, many times she would get dairy products, milk and cheese and butter from this farmer\u2122s place and it sounded very logical to me. How she did connect with them I don\u2122t know but she did. She was not happy but she was satisfied that she was able to accomplish that. And we just waited for the time that she would say when we should do it. And that time came in early August."

So about a week, I don\u2122t know exactly, but about a week after my sister left she came home one day from work and we ate our meager supper and she told me to put on two of everything that I had the best which wasn\u2122t that much left. I remember I had some high top shoes that you don\u2122t wear in the summertime but she said put them on. She packed a little bundle of stuff for herself and a bundle for me.

But by morning a lot of other people kept going into the river and by that time machine guns were going full blast all the time. There were these screams and shouts by the Ukrainian militiamen and this is something I can\u2122t get rid of that sound and of that phrase and they kept screami ng; village ???? Meaning crawl out Jew, I can see you. Most of the people cam e out. We didn\u2122t. We stayed there. That lasted a whole day and by night when night fell the machine guns were going full blast. We couldn\u2122t move. And so we stayed there. I reme mber my mother gave me that soggy bread that she packed and it tasted awful and she made me eat it. She said I needed the strength. We spent another night in the water and the next morni ng there was fire and there were screams and I heard babies crying and I guess the time they we re liquidating the ghetto. I can\u2122t say the water turned red but it should have because the mach ine guns were going again full blast all the time and we stayed in that river. I kept dozing off and I know we stayed in the river for a number of days but I don\u2122t know exactly how many days. But one moment I opened my eyes and my mother was gone and I really became panic stricken and I tried to rationa lize that I probably fell asleep and she had to make her way to the farmer\u2122s place and I would have to find my way there by myself to join her. And then all of a sudden everything got quiet. There was no movement, nothing. And I stayed until dark and then I made my way across the river and I walked. I remember walking, walking for so l ong until I came to the farmer\u2122s place, to the barn. I\u2122m sure I must have been a sight, di rty and wet and the dogs started barking and the farmer came out. It was just beginning to -- dayl ight wasn\u2122t -- I mean it was dawn and he came out in his coveralls and I asked him if my mother was there, He said no. I said well I\u2122ll wait until she comes. He said what do you mean you\u2122 ll wait, you will not wait here. I said you did agree to keep us here for a time, I didn\u2122t know for how long. He said well, I changed my mind. It\u2122s too dangerous. I said well, just let me st ay until my mother comes. He said you can stay the day, I\u2122ll give you something to eat and at night when it gets dark you better leave or I\u2122ll report you to the authorities. And I was just be wildered at that point but it was very ironic because I noticed he wore my father\u2122s gold pocket watch with the coveralls"

            "answer": "I\u2122m sure that was part of it, I\u2122m sure. But hi s wife gave me some soup and some food. I wasn\u2122t even hungry at that point. I stayed in the barn until it got dark and they gave me some bread and an apple. I remember and they told me to l eave. And I was so I gue ss bewildered and really panic stricken. I didn\u2122t think straight and I wa lked on the main street of that village. Anybody could have seen me or caught me but I was lucky. God was with me I guess if there is a God. And I walked all the way on the main street of that village until I came to an open field where we lived. It\u2122s agrarian, it\u2122s the breadbasket actu ally of Ukraine so there were these lush wheat fields and I spent the next two days in a field just sitting there like in a stupor. By that time the bread was gone and the apple was gone and I just didn\u2122t know what to do and my mind refused to give up. I felt, I don\u2122t know how to say it, bu t I felt as if I had let my mother down, that I dozed off if she had to leave me and now he\u2122s looking for someplace for me because he refused to give us protection. And so I decided then that my only way to live or to survive is to find my mother and I felt that I have to go and look for her. Our area has many forests so I decided then and there -- it was still early fall -- that I have to go from forest to forest until I find her. And that\u2122s where my odyssey really starts. I started going from forest to forest and I walked and walked and the illusion when you look at some thing -- I mean my geography wasn\u2122t any good but I soon learned south and north and east and west . You look at a forest and it seems it\u2122s so close and you walk and you walk and it\u2122s not there. I walked all night and I tried to rest in the daytime. But meanwhile I needed to eat, too. So I would try to go to little villages in the outskirts and grab something from a garden or so mething and that\u2122s the way I survived the first months. The first months were also -- several things happened that were horrible. In the very beginning I would come across stragglers like myse lf from different ghettos because apparently Hitler liquidated all the ghettos in our area abou t the same time. I would find other people in the forests who were in similar situations. They were looking for their loved ones, they were looking for friends or whatever. And so I trie d to get information about my family. Nobody knew anything and I didn\u2122t know anything about th eirs. One time we were on the edge of a forest and there were seven of us from differ ent places. There was a mother and a baby and two boys and two women. Anyway there were six ot her people and we were sitting and trying to get information from one another. And all of a sudden a bunch of kids from the neighboring village spotted us and they started yelling at us. \ufb01Jews, Jews.\ufb02 There was remuneration for reporting a Jew, however small it was. And they ran back to the village and we realized that soon somebody\u2122s going to come after us. We were sitting on the edge of a forest. This was -- there are different kinds of forest -- this one ha d very little underbrush. There was no place to hide except climbing up a tree which wasn\u2122t th e smartest thing to do. But there were huge haystacks in the field so we ran to hide in the haystacks and some how for an unexplainable reason we all ended up in the same haystack, all seven of us. I don\u2122t know what the haystack looked like on the outside but I\u2122m sure it wasn\u2122t very difficult for them to realize where we were. Pretty soon we heard voices of the villagers and the kids and they came back, they came there with pitchforks. They just made a game of it and they kept pushing the pitchforks into the haystacks. That went on for hours it seems lik e. It was in the afternoon, late afternoon. And pretty soon it was quiet and I heard a lot of commotion around me. And when it got real quiet I waited, I think it was the middle of the night when I crawled out."

Dogs would give you away if you go close to a village or to a barn. I tried, in the winter I tried to go from barn to barn a nd to keep warm or I would crawl in, they have these, they were not haystacks but where they kept, where the peasants keep the potatoes.

It got so many times where I just didn\u2122t even care but I kept getting my strength from the fact that I had to find my mother. I never found her. And th en apparently I got very sick and I was like in a little grave covered with leaves in the forest and the Russian soldiers found me th ere. I don\u2122t know how long I was there and they took me to some hospita ls and they nursed me back to health. My quest, my search for my mother continued and wh en the war was over I went back to my home town. I found that there was one other person who survived. She was an older woman. As a matter of fact she is here in America. She lives in Duluth, Minnesota. An d other than that there were no other survivors. I mean there were pe ople who made their way illegally during the war but the survivors from the ghetto were just myse lf and this other woman. And when I got back to my hometown I didn\u2122t learn much except that somebody denounced my sister and they tortured her and they humiliated her. They para ded her on the main street in the nude and then they murdered her. And that must have happene d very shortly after she left. I never found out what happened to my mother and I don\u2122t know fo r sure what happened to my father. You know the horrible feeling -- there is nothing tangible for me to mourn. When someone dies you have a cemetery, you can go and put some flowers and say a prayer. I have nothing. And to this day it seems, I know it\u2122s ridiculous but when I walk and when I see someone -- my father was about 6\u21224\ufb02 and my mother was almost 6 foot tall --and when I see someone of the build and height, people remind me of my parents. I have to run in front of them ad look back to see it\u2122s not them. And then I made my way. I kept still looking for my mother and everybody said all survivors or people who survived are going to Germany. So illegally from what became the Soviet Union again I went through Bratislava and Vienna to Germany. That\u2122s the way all the survivors went. When we came to Germany there were lots of people, all sorts of people there. The ironic thing was that these people were survivors like myself, the remnants. And there were people who were running from the consequen ces of their collaborating with the Germans and so we all ended up in the same DP camps and th at was very, very difficult. But finally they did separate us. And then even though we, as a su rvivor and as an orphan at that point, I still had to wait three years."

Well, th e visa that I did get, the permanent visa came earlier. But it was three years that I had to wait."

I came in like on June 25 th and I think June 26th she sent me to Central High. I didn\u2122t speak a wo rd of English and I hated the world and I hated myself but it was the best thing they did, tried to give me some educat ion. And then I met my husband. He was called back into the service and guess where his first assignment is?"

            "answer": "That\u2122s right, you\u2122re right. And I refused to go until I became a citizen, an American citizen. And then I went back and it was difficult. That \u2122s my life in a nutshell. For many years I didn\u2122t speak out. I told my husband, I told my son but my family, the few who were still alive didn\u2122t want to hear about it. And it was difficult for me to talk about it so I didn\u2122t. But then in 1983 there was a gathering here in Washington and I we nt to that gathering and something in me, I just sort of awoke and I said I\u2122m ready; I have to tell my story. I have a mandate. I felt as if I have a mandate to speak for all these and I call them martyrs not vi ctims who never had a chance. And I\u2122m their spokesperson. I have to speak out and tell the story because I don\u2122t want the world to forget. And yet I sometimes, I have n\u2122t done it in recent months, but I was speaking at the Capital Children\u2122s Museum about a year a go and there was a class of -- I think -- fourth graders which is quite young and you speak in not very severe terms to children that age. But they came with several chaperones and one of the fathers who was a chaperone came over to me after my presentation and he says Mrs. Skif f\u2013.I says Schiff -- yes, Mrs. Schiff come on, admit, it\u2122s all a figment of your imagination. So that\u2122s where we are today. And I feel, I mean that I do have a mission and I try. It\u2122s not gettin g any easier for me but I feel that I do have to do it. I have to tell people what happened and maybe we\u2122ll learn something from our past. But apparently we haven\u2122t learned very much. Look what\u2122s going on in Bosnia. Look what\u2122s going on in Somalia, Sudan, the Soviet Union. People are hungry for power and there\u2122s so much hate in this world. I don\u2122t know how we can get rid of it -- intolerance, hate, I don\u2122t know. So this is my dilemma, what I have to live with. Do you have any questions?"

I know that my father had several doctorates from Switzerland, from the Sorbonne and I\u2122m not sure about Heidelberg but I mean I know he had several advanced degrees from different places. What was puzzling to me then I understand now. None of them were from Poland. In Poland apparently there was a quota and he had to go elsewhere to get his education.

You want to he ar something funny? When I came back in 1988 my husband and I talked what would I find and he tried to warn me not to be disappointed and what have you. And then it was sort of like an afterthought he said well whatever they did to the town, the ghettos were erased apparently I don\u2122t know I haven\u2122t seen it now, but he said at least the river, you\u2122ll show me the river which was so important in your life. Guess what? They diverted the river. When I asked I said I want to show my husband the river they said no more river, no more river. The river\u2122s name was Bezimyenna and Bezimyenna in Polish means no name. And I mean no name and they did away with it."

Th ey never had the heart to ask me because here haystacks are pretty small and there they do di fferent kinds but these haystacks were so huge they were almost like a barn, so big.
