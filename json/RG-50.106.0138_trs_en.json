            "question": "How would you describe yourself as a child? Were you outgoing, or were you quiet?",
            "answer": "Oh, I was very outgoing and very curious. Any [indecipherable] that did \u2014 I was always very inquisitive, why is it so, and a \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and how it could \u2014 it \u2014 how is it that is so and so. And it was in the same school that \u2014 I don\u2019t know what grade he was, but anyhow, the \u2014 there was a time when the ve \u2014 Viennese Jews came to Poland. And of course they were very rich and brought their stuff and bought houses and all that, and \u2014 but the kids had to come to school with us. And a \u2014 they didn\u2019t sp \u2014 when they \u2014 the parents always spoke German, but the kids would answer them in Polish. And \u2014 but there was this one who, well I think we were just so jealous of her because she was big and \u2014 and she had a maid who carried her satchel to school. But of course she was so heavy that she couldn\u2019t carry all this stuff. And there were four of us going along the side \u2014 in the \u2014 Beniki(ph) there was this \u2014 this close to the Vistula river, so there\u2019s this part where you walk, but \u2014 but then 1t comes down. Not in a ditch, but it just \u2014 and the bank lowers a little bit towards the street. And low \u2014 we all \u2014 there were four friends of us, and we all wish we\u2019d got together, and so whenever this girl and the maid would come, we wouldn\u2019t let her through. And one day, I don\u2019t know why, one of us, some newcomer came and she \u2014 sh-she joined the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure \" February 2, 2001 group and it came so that we pushed this other gir \u2014 not the girl, but the maid fell down. And so she went to the school and she complained that we are misbehaving and all that kind of stuff, and then the teacher called us in and then the principal called us in, and then the teacher said \u2014 cause she went to the principal and then the principal told the teacher that \u2014 what kind of children she\u2019s bringing up. Course, that was a class of 40 kids, so she couldn\u2019t really watch over everyone. But she says to us, why did you push them, or did you push her? And somebody says, because she 1s a Jew. And the teacher said, uh-uh, then you would push Holy Mary in the ditch too. No, never. How would we? She said, oh yes you would, and you would put Jesus in a ditch, too. And we said why? She says, because they were Jews. And of course, nobody ever told us that, you know, you always talk about all this other stuff. And we had a religion class every day, so the Jewish girls went to school, th-they had a free period, and then on \u2014 when they had to go to school, I think on Sunday they had their religious school, so for religion they went to their own rabbi. And so there was \u2014 I had an afet \u2014 uncle who was an atheist, and he all \u2014 and this preacher \u2014 I mean, this religion teacher always says, any questions? And this uncle of mine always would ask \u2014 say ask him about this and that, and there were all kinds of questions, you know, that a priest couldn\u2019t really answer to s \u2014 little children. And so this day, it \u2014 I\u2019m just keep on, you know, telling him [indecipherable] when he said, are there any questions, I say, yeah, yeah, he \u2014 but he just want \u2014 disregarded me, because he Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure \" February 2, 2001 didn\u2019t want any stupid questions again. But I almost knock his glasses off, and I say \u2014 so he says okay, now what is it today? And I say, is this true that J-Jesus was a Jew? And he say, yeah, and his mother and his apostles and the first Christians were Jews. And then I say, how come we never knew about it, you know. But anyhow, I think that from that moment on, mine attitude toward Jews was changed. You know there was that, before when I \u2014 when I looked \u2014 course, you couldn\u2019t tell who was a Jew if they were not having the itzkeys(ph) and all that kind of stuff, and the mitzkeys(ph) on top, or howarts(ph) with all this stuff, you couldn't tell. But then since that time I keep looking, you know, whether I \u2014 cause there was this stupid idea that I recognize Jesus in one of them, but I mean \u2014 anyhow, that\u2019s how my attitude \u2014 I never had any non-attitude toward Jews since they were my school friends, okay, and school friends don\u2019t talk about religion. You talk about your school things, and your girl things and you don\u2019t talk about big things. But since then I\u2014I was more friendly, and how would I say? Yeah, more interested, you know. And so then when I was [indecipherable] my best friend was Sarah Feldman and they lived on the corner there. By the way in the same house that the pope used to live as a little boy. And that was on the Vistula river. W-We live on this corner, on the Debieniczka(ph) market, and on the other one, Sarah Feldman live in this house, and here\u2019s some place lived the present pope as a young boy. And Sarah was telling me something about the Diaspora, you know. Course, it wasn\u2019t Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure : February 2, 2001 called Diaspora in those days, but she says [indecipherable] Jew, and I just didn\u2019t believe her, you know. I always thought there \u2014 I thought this old par \u2014 Polish Jews were \u2014 there were no Jews anyplace else but in Poland. Especially then, when I went to school, we are no longer \u2014 we are asked never to call them Jews, but Poles of Mosaic confession \u2014 or persuasion, pardon me. Because my te \u2014 now my teacher said, this word Jews is a word that came from Russia and it was an insulting word. And that\u2019s where you to \u2014 when we \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t be using it. And \u2014 but then, you know how when you says Pole of a Mosaic persuasion, how long that is, your mouth, you \u2014 to say she 1s \u2014 and we never said she is Jewish. I don\u2019t know, maybe we did. No [indecipherable] and we always says in the Jewish she or he, because in Polish that\u2019s possible. And anyhow, that\u2019s how I was brought up. You know, even today when I do the translations for the Red Cross and it says of nationality Polish, and religion, I always say Mosaic, because I \u2014 I had to \u2014 and they always would put \u2014 tho-those who correct those things said Jewish, and I said no, so I wrote j \u2014 the Polish Red Cross and I said, now what is it? Because when I went to school, in [indecipherable] documents, it said confession, it says either Roman Catholic or Evangelic or whatever, or Mosaic. I mean, there was no such a thing like Jewish.

And I said, well, I have this woman big \u2014 and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a sin or not, and I was telling him that, you know, I was teaching this Catholic prayers to a woman who was Jewish, and was this a sin. And he says oh no, no, no, you\u2019Il be saving her life, no. So he give me a blessing and told me to say three Holy Mary\u2019s and that thing was over.

And then there \u2014 the other guys started making fun, that he was in love with me, so the mother, who was a Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure ~ February 2, 2001 spinner took him away and he was helping her and I got some \u2014 and I was helping some other men. But anyhow, sometimes, you know, they would put something for you in the \u2014 or give you something. And later on they ask us to come to their house and there was this big \u2014 big sign that says fraternization with the Poles is forbidden, don\u2019t you ever have them at your table and all that. But the way they went around this, that they would say, we need worker in my house, or in my garden. Because most of these people were in a small farm [indecipherable] and all that, so they needed help. And I heard one woman that, I don\u2019t know how I got to talking about smoked fish. And I says oh, I\u2019m dreaming of that smoked fish [indecipherable] smoked fish and scruts(ph) and all that. And he says, you dreaming about that? And I say yeah, because I\u2019m hungry. And wa \u2014 he said, you know, when we get the smoked fish on rations, then you \u2014 I \u2014 you come to my house. And I said, didn\u2019t you see this where it says no \u2014 and they said \u2014 and I said, the only way you can get me is to say you need a help to work [indecipherable] every house in Germany had this supervisor was a Hitlerjugend \u2014 I mean a Hitler \u2014 a Nazi party woman that watched over the houses so nothing happened. So when we heard this woman coming, I always went on the floor, you know, and pretended to be pu \u2014 shi \u2014 shining it or scrubbing it, whatever it was, you know. But there were people who almost, you know, I was just pure lucky, we all were pure lucky, and that\u2019s why I wrote this book, because when my father [indecipherable] this conversation, I said no, not all Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure ~ February 2, 2001 Germans were brutal, cruel and all that. It was the system, but there were some good people, ah ba-ba-ba-ba, so that\u2019s why this whole book came about, but \u2014"

I mean, I \u2014 I didn\u2019t like the Soviets and I didn\u2019t like the Polish government, and that was it.

A bunch of foreigners getting work and all that. And you know, it\u2019d be better if you didn\u2019t work here, because it\u2019s gonna be bad for me, too. So there I was, and that was at noon and we always went to the YMCA to eat. And I was crying all the way and there was a blonde woman sitting there and she says, what is she crying about? And she knew this girl. And she says, ah, because she just lost her work. And she \u2014 this woman says something \u2014 somehow it ca \u2014 wa \u2014 came to tell me, she says oh, she can come and stay with us, and we\u2019re gonna look for a job for her. Because the office \u2014 not the office, but the universal \u2014 the office of the Universal Match Company, the headquarters is really n-near where we live. And so I went to live with them, was the family of a mother and three sisters. One sister, the one that \u2014 Blondie, or Bonnie, who took me in, and two sisters from the other father. And it turned out \u2014 she later told me that she only \u2014 oh yeah, the sister said, oh she only took her in so there would be two against two, because they were always quarreling about who 1s a better person in this family. But anyhow, they took me to this office in Ferguson and the \u2014 to this Universal Match Company and the director of whoever the personnel office 124 Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 is. Oh sorry, but we don\u2019t have any work for her. And I started crying and I said, gosh, after all this. I don\u2019t know, somehow I mentioned the word camps. The minute I said the word camps, the guy woke up and he says, what camps? And of course the directors were all Jewish, to say the tra \u2014 to say the least. And he says, what camp? And I says, through the tears and I said, well this and that and all that. And he tooks \u2014 picks up the telephone and he calls up the office of the Universal Match Company in Saint Louis and he says, I need that work for a person that you just let go. She\u2019s a typist. And, do you take shorthand? And I say yeah, a little bit, but not very \u2014 yeah, I knew Polish and German shorthand, so I always took notes in German shorthand, but \u2014 anyhow, so \u2014 and I was so lucky that next to \u2014 across the street from the girls where I lived, lived one of the personnel \u2014 one of \u2014 somebody there lived who also worked in Universal Match Company, so he would take me home and bring me back. You have to get up five o\u2019clock because it was far away from this \u2014 yeah, ferg \u2014 was called Ferguson, | think. And so, I started working and I start first time on an electric typewriter. And I was used to this regular typewriter. So I \u2014 I hit this type \u2014 I mean, you know, I hit this thing and somebody says, thanks God this \u2014 it\u2019s look as if this typewriter was gonna float \u2014 fly out through the window. But somebody says thanks God sh \u2014 she \u2014 the windows were closed because otherwise I don\u2019t know what would happen. You know, I was at seventh or eighth floor, or tenth, I don\u2019t know. But anyhow, ni \u2014 so I worked there, and I stayed with the girls, but since I Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 125 Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 was starting going to school, it was so difficult for me because I had after cl \u2014 after work I went to school, to night school at Washington U. And I\u2019m just coming home, I was asleep and I was holding onto this strap in a bus and the ba \u2014 guy would say, sleeping beauty, time to get up, you arrived. And so I said I got to look for another place to live. So I was looking and I was going through this Washington Street, I think, and every place it says for rent, for rent, and it \u2014 then I see this one it says for rent, for rent, and it was just cl \u2014 you know, in the middle between work and school. But it says, no women wanted or somethi \u2014 only from \u2014 only for men. I don\u2019t remember the wording on this thing. And so, as I pass by, the two old ladies were sitting on a porch and I look at the sign and I pass by. And one of them gets up and she says, aren\u2019t you gonna come in? And I say, why I\u2019m a woman, I can\u2019t come in. And I was dressed up, you know, to kill. And so what are you looking for? And I say, well, I\u2019m looking for a place, because I live in Ferguson, it\u2019s too far for me to school, between work and school. She says, well, why don\u2019t you look at the room? So, take me up. She took me upstairs and I went upstairs and this and that and I said, well how about cooking facilities? And she says, well, we don\u2019t let anybody cook, but if you promise that you never leave any dirty dishes and that you \u2014 and we give you a little place. She evidently liked me, okay? And so I stayed with them. I stayed with them until I got married."

And of course Eisenhower was my liberator, so I voted for him. But then \u2014 then when I was in school in Frostburg, I had to make extra money after my husband left, and I work in a kitchen. And I lived in a house where there was a restaurant dow-downstairs and then we live upstairs. And so it was the easiest work for me because I didn't have to Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 138 Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 get dressed or anything like that. And I could leave the boy upstairs and the people from the hotel were watching him.

And I only stopped working in this restaurant because they said, be very polite to the customers, but the customers always weren\u2019t \u2014 he says, and don\u2019t put the bill on the \u2014 on the table, give it to them \u2014 give it to his hand. Well, you give this to his hand and he holds your hand. He asks you for a date and all that kind of stuff. And I said, but you are married, cause you can see. And he says, well, that doesn\u2019t matter. So that\u2019s how I say, oh my gosh, I can\u2019t work like that and then study and all this. So there was the \u2014 he says, well the only other job he says, to wash dishes. And so I went to wash dishes, but my son was always showing \u2014 there\u2019s a peephole and he was showing people that his mother is working washing dishes. Well \u2014 and well, I wouldn\u2019t have stopped this work except that one day I put my chemistry notes al \u2014 on this washing machine, and when I open it, you know, the \u2014 the damp, or \u2014"

And then \u2014 then I no \u2014 by that time I graduated, and I already had this job waiting for me, so anyways [indecipherable] [tape break] Well, anyhow, Janet Levin was \u2014 I met Janet Levin in Cumberland and before I met Janet Levin I knew a Jewish family, a furrier\u2019s family that I went to visit and \u2014 and I saw the Hanukkah candle and so she says, oh how do you \u2014 I said, when is Hanukkah? And she said, how do you know about Hanukah? And I said well, I come from a place that has every fra \u2014 fifth person is a Jew, so you have to know about Hanukkah. But anyhow, one day this man says, I got bad news \u2014 bad news for you, I\u2019m losing my sight. And I said, oh you [indecipherable] your Hebrew, I could read it to you. Cause I was a lady of leisure at that time.

And so that\u2019s how I met Janet because I was looking for a rabbi and this \u2014 you know, the Polish rabbi with the harvartz(ph) and all that kind of stuff and I didn\u2019t see anything, I just saw young men at the door of the shul. And this redhead comes to me and says, you waiting for somebody? And I say yes, for the rabbi. Oh, there he 1s. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 140 Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 And I said, where? And she says there, there, the man at the door, shaking hands with the people. I said, that\u2019s not a rabbi. You sure he\u2019s a rabbi? I ought to know, he\u2019s my husband. That\u2019s how I met Janet and we become very good friends.

But she gave me, as inheritance, to her friend Linda Ford, who still lives in Baltimore, and she says, now remember when there\u2019s any holidays, make sure you invite her to your house for holidays. So ever since I\u2019ve been going to this Linda Ford. And before she was Linda Ford, she was Linda Polack(ph). And so that comes New Year\u2019s, or Easter, I mean I \u2014 I\u2019m always there, as an inheritance. So when she introduces me to other people she says, that\u2019s my inheritance.

            "answer": "Well, I do \u2014 in the very beginning we would get application that f \u2014 somebody is looking for mother, father, brother, whatever it 1s, so there are certain forms, specially the forms \u2014 the forms were different [indecipherable] in every year the forms got \u2014 were changed just to \u2014 to make it easier because the \u2014 you get an application from us, and we send this to the international tracing service in Arolsen. And then they look in the papers and course they have all their lists, and if anybody 142 Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 can find anybody, it\u2019s supposed to be there. Because there were \u2014 but however it\u2019s difficult because before the Gestapo and the SS left, they burned most of their materials. So it\u2019s very difficult to \u2014 to really find somebody. You can never find names, for example, of \u2014 right after the war, when Poland lost the war, all the Jewish synagogues were burned, and po \u2014 Jewish population\u2019s registers was kept by \u2014 by the synagogues, the birth and the marriage records and all that. So once the synagogue was burned, that was it. And ben \u2014 then besides, since the Jews never lived together with the Poles, or the very few Pole \u2014 Poles knew the Jews and the Jews knew the Poles. They only knew each other in commercial situations, but not that I could go \u2014 some \u2014 somebody could swear yeah, I know this \u2014 this Jew came from this and this place, or this. So we can\u2019t really find anybody like that. Besides, what they did sometimes, they got this whole Jewish population on the side of some river or something and shot them, or whatever it was. And in the very beginning it was like that. And \u2014 course they didn\u2019t use them for work like they did later, they just got smarter [indecipherable] smarter in quotation marks. And so it\u2019s \u2014 so we were looking for these people, but it\u2019s very difficult to find it, especially women. But seems like men, who were then put to work, were easier to trace, whereas women and children were shot before they were even put to work or anything like that, so \u2014 so what we did, we would just write out the names and professions and where they were born and all that, and you think possible that could facilitate the finding. 143 Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001"

That\u2019s the insight that I got. And I don\u2019t know on the other hand \u2014 no, that\u2019s not maybe in the museum I didn't learn that, but I was asking myself, how would \u2014 you know, when you hear all this at \u2014 anti-Polish expressions, how we \u2014 how we have killed the Jews, and how we didn\u2019t help and all that. Nobody ever \u2014 I don\u2019t know somebody \u2014 I wrote to the paper and was published, too. Like, for example, the present te \u2014 two organizations that, where the Jewish mothers threw their children through the floor traps, somebody would pick them up, and I \u2014 I was serving on one of those \u2014 how is it, stations, so to say. If you saw a train that was coming through and has a certain markings, which meant there were children on it. Now, didn\u2019t say Jewish children or Polish children, but there were some markings on the trains that \u2014 that you knew there were children, and you had to tell somebody else that so and so train passed Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 155 Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 through this station. And there were \u2014 then you knew that someplace between one place and the other, there could have been a child who was dropped through the floor. And then the \u2014 somebody would see to it that the child was picked up. And this was all organized, and I think it was organized by the present pope, I think, of \u2014 he wasn\u2019t a pope then, of course. But it was all organized this way to pick up the children that were dropped, so \u2014 and it \u2014 nobody even knows about it. And it\u2019s true, there were [indecipherable] and were bad people, like in every nation you had bad people. But why should I be paying and be responsible for people who were bad? And yet, it\u2019s just because I\u2019m saying I\u2019m Polish, the mother says, huh oh. I mean, it happens very often. I mean, in Red Cross there was this new worker there and she says to me, ah, the Poles were so horrible to the Jews, killed them during \u2014 and she is not even Jewish. And she says \u2014 and I said, who told you stuff like that? Absolute there were people like that, but they weren\u2019t any better than the J-Jewish O.D. I mean, you know what O.D. is? Ordnungsdienst, so the Jewish police. I mean, it was just as cruel as the Polish police or anybody else. I mean, and you \u2014 nobody \u2014 they were more hated in the ghetto some \u2014 for example, than \u2014 than even the Polish police, cause you can always bribe the Polish police. And of course I understand the \u2014 the Ordnungsdienst, or the yi \u2014 Jewish police, they wanted to stay alive, so \u2014 I mean, this whole idea was that everybody who was in this situation had to \u2014 wanted to survive, and the will to survive makes you do things that \u2014 I don\u2019t know what I 156 Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 would do if it was I who had to decide, who had to fight for my life, and f \u2014 and make a \u2014 prolong it for one or two or three days. Of course, ther \u2014 you were always promised you\u2019re gonna stay alive longer. And I mean, the insight probably that I gain is that you never know what you would do in a given situation, that no matter how much I b \u2014 was taught about this forgive our trespasses, love your brother like your own, like yourself. I don\u2019t know what I would do, if I were pushed toward the wall. If my back was toward the wall, what would I do? And for God to judge people. I don\u2019t know if we have the right to do it. Like the Indians say, don\u2019t judge a person until you walk in his moccasins. And that\u2019s the truest truth there is, really."

            "answer": "No, they all are in Polish except the one in the little German town that was published in Germany, because the Germans got hold of it and translated it and published without sending me the copy of the translations. So they are \u2014 and I was an idiot enough, I have \u2014 I have no contract or anything like with \u2014 with them. So finally the guy said, if they sell 1,000 and the editor, I mean the publisher says 1,000 159 Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 copies, then I get some \u2014 and the \u2014 his financial assistant said 1,500. And so I\u2019m not gonna wait for that, okay\u2019? The fact is that I put down something so that those who come after us knows what this generation of us went through and yet somehow survived. And I think that the reason why we really survive is the 20 years of po \u2014 Polish independence, cause then we were \u2014 after the 123 years of being taken by Russians, Prussians and Austrians, in this free Poland, the Pilsudski\u2019s free Poland, we \u2014 it was imbued in this crowd of the old Poland, and I always was in this camp of this nation of a ma \u2014 kingdom or republic of free nations, you know how that if you le \u2014 stick together instead of quarrel, you can be somebody. And I always wanted Poland to be multi-culture and multi-religious. And I had this teacher who always \u2014 in elementary school, who always complain how dumb the Polish government is and those national democrats and all and this \u2014 and so finally \u2014 and we finally said well, can you tell us when Poland was really big? And \u2014 and she says, Ill tell you. And she said, when the Russian Greek \u2014 no, when the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox pre \u2014 prince said to his son, whom he sent to Italy to study, remember son, you are a Pole. He says, that\u2019s where Poland could be proud of herself. And that stuck with me so that \u2014 of course that\u2019s impossible in this situation, when all those new ethnical quarrels and all this. I mean, people somehow didn\u2019t know that you can live in peace, speaking a different language, pursuing a different religion, and \u2014 and I mean, and live in peace in one country. Somehow people just 160 Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 don\u2019t see it, you can see it now, Africa or Yugoslavia, wherever we are, you see the same old stuff, this hatred. And \u2014 but then everybody says that I am is \u2014 all cynical and only see the bad side of the \u2014 of the history and I have a friend who says, now my gosh, she finally said something good. And she sa \u2014 no, because I always see the downside of life. And I said, when you look around, there is no up side. There are the rich and there are the poor. There are the educated and uneducated. And I know it\u2019s the fault of an uneducated who drop from school and all that. And I see it\u2019s the \u2014 every religious \u2014 whether it be a rabbi or a priest or whoever the others ones, they all preach their own catechism and \u2014 but I said, but now, since we \u2014 since I see the Catholic church said we \u2014 not every \u2014 I have to \u2014 have to tell this to Mr. Rosen, but this \u2014 this writing in the bulletin and says something about [indecipherable] yeah, something about the desert through which our ancestors fr \u2014 no, it\u2019s talking aya \u2014 in the life, working through life as in a \u2014 like our spiritual forefather or faithful father \u2014 yeah, I got my faithful fathers walked through the desert, as they coming back, th- this Judeo-Christian idea. And \u2014 but to see that written in a bulletin, that\u2019s kind of \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s a totally different aspect as you have seen, let\u2019s say, even 20 years ago, before this pope. And I \u2014 I think that \u2014 but then you own the other \u2014 the Christian and the Jews can get together now, but how about the Arabs and the Jews? I mean, this idea of killing \u2014 going to heaven when you kill an enemy? I mean it\u2019s just so Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure er February 2, 2001 inhuman, the whole thought is inhuman.

Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure ee February 2, 2001 I mean, here the guy goes through all this trouble to buy this chicken and his mother refuses to eat because it\u2019s not kosher. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 I understand, walking through the desert you had to keep your hygiene so that you stay alive, cause the \u2014 not enough water and \u2014 and p-plagues and bad food could just kill a whole family, whole tribe. But I mean, in modern times? But that \u2014 that was what makes me \u2014 what made me really not believe.

And then \u2014 but when I\u2019m in that church, I pray, and I say this Our Father and all this. And of course \u2014 an-and the reason why I really don\u2019t see any af \u2014 saw any anti-Semitism is because you always read this first old Bible, you know the \u2014 you know the \u2014 they is \u2014 and then be \u2014 the Bible, the story from the Bible \u2014"

And I speak \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014I really \u2014 not that I miss Poland, but I have love for it, for my beginnings and \u2014 on \u2014 but now on the other side I\u2019m very \u2014 I love America because it gives a chance, those of us who were su \u2014 couldn\u2019t go back or didn\u2019t want to go back to Poland, gave us a new beginning. It\u2019s like a \u2014 it\u2019s like a promised land, in a way. And of course, not everybody\u2019s life was a paradise on the country. Some people had a very, very hard life. Not I, not that \u2014 being not excluded. But yeah, it\u2019s a country that gave us a chance to be something."

            "answer": "Well, no. I just hope that we never \u2014 that our children and our grandchildren will never have to suffer or see others suffer and not do anything about it. And that this whole horror was brought to me by this death of Jan Karski, who \u2014 who tried so bravely to na \u2014 to \u2014 to tell the world about what\u2019s going on and nobody would listen to him. And whenever I think about har \u2014 and about how this man felt, that he failed, he \u2014 in his life, because despite all he tried, he couldn\u2019t move anybody to do anything. On the other hand, I don\u2019t know what he expected people to do, and what could have been done. But 1-it\u2019s just he, when I first saw him, o-on Lehrman Miles with us, his goodbye dinner or something, you know, and he \u2014 he was talking about how Mr. Lehrman Miles help him after his wife died, and then Mr. Miles said the same thing about him, how wonderful Karski was, and how a courageous man. But I know that he felt, yeah, from the talk \u2014 talking \u2014 from talking with him, he knew that he felt that he really didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t do \u2014 that he failed to do what he wanted to do. But then, it\u2019s easy to judge again, without knowing. And even American Jewry didn\u2019t do anything, but on the other hand I understand they were afraid of a 173 Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 backlash. And so this worl \u2014 life is so complicated. There\u2019s no such a thing like a easy, straight line. And everybody brings into this life his own dislikes and likes, his own ideas, and they always in conflict with somebody else\u2019s. And the wisdom is \u2014 or would be, t-to do the right thing, but how many of us think about it? Not everybody can think that clearly and long distance. Then we have our own problems, and everybody\u2019s involved in our own life and pr \u2014 solving our problems, and it\u2019s not easy to live. So that\u2019s why probably people are believing in God, because this \u2014 without knowing that \u2014 believing that there is something up there, or wherever, in space, life would be worthless. That\u2019s it."
