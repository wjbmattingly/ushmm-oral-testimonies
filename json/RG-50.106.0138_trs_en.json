            "question": "How would you desc ribe yourself as a child? Were you outgoing, or were you quiet?",
            "answer": "Oh, I was very outgoing and very curious. Any [indecipherable] that did \u0152 I was always very inquisitive, why is it so, and a \u0152 and \u0152 and \u0152 and how it could \u0152 it \u0152 how is it that is so and so. And it was in the same school that \u0152 I don\u2122t know what grade he was, but anyhow, the \u0152 there was a time when the ve \u0152 Viennese Jews came to Poland . And of course they were very rich and brought their stuff and bought houses and all that, and \u0152 but the kids had to come to school with us. And a \u0152 they didn\u2122t sp \u0152 when they \u0152 the parents always spoke Ge rman, but the kids would answer them in Polish. And \u0152 but there was this one who, well I think we were just so jealous of her because she was big and \u0152 and she had a maid who carried her satchel to school. But of course she was so heavy that she couldn\u2122t carry all this stuff. And there were four of us going along the side \u0152 in the \u0152 Beniki(ph) there was this \u0152 this close to the Vistula river, so there\u2122s this part where you walk, but \u0152 but then it comes down. Not in a ditch, but it just \u0152 and the bank lowers a little bit towards the street. And low \u0152 we all \u0152 there were four friends of us, and we all wish we\u2122d got together, and so whenever this girl and the maid would come, we wouldn\u2122t let her through. And one day, I don\u2122t know why, one of us, some newcomer came and she \u0152 sh-she joined the Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 11group and it came so that we pushed this other gir \u0152 not the girl, but the maid fell down. And so she went to the school and she complained that we are misbehaving and all that kind of stuff, and then the teacher called us in and then the principal called us in, and then the teacher said \u0152 cause she went to the principal and then the principal told the teacher that \u0152 what kind of children she\u2122s bringing up. Course, that was a class of 40 kids, so she couldn\u2122t rea lly watch over everyone. But she says to us, why did you push them, or did you push her? And somebody says, because she is a Jew. And the teacher said, uh-uh, then you would push Holy Mary in the ditch too. No, never. How would we? She said, oh yes you would, a nd you would put Jesus in a ditch, too. And we said why? She says , because they were Jews. And of course, nobody ever told us that, you know, you always talk about all this other stuff. And we had a religion class every day, so the Je wish girls went to school, th-they had a free period, and then on \u0152 when they had to go to school, I think on Sunday they had their religious school, so for religion they went to their own rabbi. And so there was \u0152 I had an afet \u0152 uncle who was an atheist, and he all \u0152 and this preacher \u0152 I mean, this religion teacher always says, any questions? And this uncle of mine always would ask \u0152 say ask him about this and that, and ther e were all kinds of questions, you know, that a priest couldn\u2122t really answer to s \u0152 little children. And so this day, it \u0152 I\u2122m just keep on, you know, telling him [indecipherable] when he said, are there any questions, I say, yeah, yeah, he \u0152 but he just want \u0152 disregarded me, because he Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 12didn\u2122t want any stupid questions again. But I almost knock his glasses off, and I say \u0152 so he says okay, now what is it t oday? And I say, is this true that J-Jesus was a Jew? And he say, yeah, and his mother and his apostles and the first Christians were Jews. And then I say, how come we neve r knew about it, you know. But anyhow, I think that from that moment on, mine attitude toward Jews was changed. You know there was that, before when I \u0152 when I looked \u0152 course, you couldn\u2122t tell who was a Jew if they were not having the itzkeys(ph) and all that kind of stuff, and the mitzkeys (ph) on top, or howarts(ph) with all this stuff, you couldn't tell. But then since that time I keep looking, you know, whether I \u0152 cause there was this stupid idea that I recognize Jesus in one of them, but I mean \u0152 anyhow, that\u2122s how my attitude \u0152 I never had any non-attitude toward Jews since they were my school friends, okay, and school friends don\u2122t ta lk about religion. You talk about your school things, and your girl things and you don\u2122t talk about big things. But since then I \u0152 I was more friendly, and how would I say? Yeah, more interested, you know. And so then when I was [indecipherable] my best friend was Sarah Feldman and they lived on the corner there. By the way in the same house that the pope used to live as a little boy. And that was on the Vistula river. W-We live on this corner, on the Debieniczka(ph) market, and on the other one, Sarah Feldman live in this house, and here\u2122s some place lived the present pope as a young boy. And Sarah was telling me something about the Diaspora , you know. Course, it wasn\u2122t Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 13called Diaspora in those days, but she says [indecipherable] Jew, and I just didn\u2122t believe her, you know. I always thought there \u0152 I thought this old par \u0152 Polish Jews were \u0152 there were no Jews anyplace else but in Poland. Especially then, when I went to school, we are no longer \u0152 we are asked never to call them Jews, but Poles of Mosaic confession \u0152 or persuasion, pardon me. Because my te \u0152 now my teacher said, this word Jews is a word that came from Russia and it was an insulting word. And that\u2122s where you to \u0152 when we \u0152 we shouldn\u2122t be using it. And \u0152 but then, you know how when you says Pole of a Mosaic persuasion, how long that is, your mouth, you \u0152 to say she is \u0152 and we never said she is Jewish. I don\u2122t know, maybe we did. No [indecipherable] and we always says in the Jewish she or he, because in Polish that\u2122s possible. And anyhow, that\u2122s how I was brought up. You know, even today when I do the translations for the Red Cross and it says of nationality Polish, and religion, I always say Mosaic, because I \u0152 I had to \u0152 and they always would put \u0152 tho-those who correct those things said Jewish, and I said no, so I wrote j \u0152 the Polish Red Cross and I said, now what is it? Because when I went to school, in [indecipherable] documents, it said confession, it says either Roman Catholic or Evangelic or whatever, or Mosaic. I mean, there was no such a thing like Jewish. So \u0152 and besides I say to this lady in th e Red Cross, that\u2122s an insult. And [indecipherable] Jews used an insulting words where it\u2122s possible, you know. And \u0152 because they didn\u2122t know any different. Bu t anyhow, so that\u2122s how \u0152 if you have Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 14friends \u0152 and this also played \u0152 how to say, not \u0152 I don\u2122t know, of course, in \u0152 in the gymnasium too, we had girls who were Jewish, and one of my \u0152 I was one Eva , and the other one al \u0152 Eva Kliseberg(ph). But then we were in \u0152 we used a bad Polish \u0152 well we \u0152 if we wanted to insult her, if somebody wanted to insult anyone whose name end in erg, like Kliseberg(ph) or Oberberg (ph) or something, well in Polish there, to indicate a young girl, a daughter of somebody, you end \u0152 you put the ending uvna to indicate that she is an unmarried young girl. Now, but if your name ends in G, [indecipherable] and you end and you add this uvna, that gives you a word for human waste.

And then I ask one girl, I say, y-you don\u2122t have \u0152 do you s \u0152 sometimes think that you\u2122re doing the wrong thing? And she says no, we all pray to the same God. And the same thi ng was, when I first started teaching this Jewish lady, pau \u0152 saying the prayers, some \u0152 some \u0152 I went to the priest and I say \u0152 because I thought I was doing bad thing converting this Jewish lady, teaching her Polish prayers, Catholic prayers. And so I we nt to this priest and I said \u0152 I took \u0152 you can go to confession and you know, and all that, and he says, well, confess your sins. And I said, well, I have this woman big \u0152 a nd I don\u2122t know if it\u2122s a sin or not, and I was telling him that, you know, I was teaching this Catholic prayers to a woman who was Jewish, and was this a sin. And he says oh no, no, no, you\u2122ll be saving her life, no. So he give me a blessing a nd told me to say three Holy Mary\u2122s and that thing was over. So I thought that meant, because th en I really knew that when she says we all believe in one God, so who \u0152 who \u0152 what does it matter. But \u0152"

            "answer": "There were absolutely no Jewish D \u0152 displaced persons because they were in a separate camp. And so \u0152 but I knew some friends that once in awhile I would meet, but they were just in different locations and ju \u0152 only once in awhile I would see them, they would come and visit, but that was [indecipherable] or I go and visit.

I don\u2122t \u0152 I need somebody to translate and write German letters.

So I says, but I go to school, and I cannot give you much time, but just maybe a few hours. And so he \u0152 I did work , and of course when the time came \u0152 by the time I got this certificate I have to come to the immigration office, and so when they learned that I working for a consul ate and for the Polish Trade and Commerce later on, well somebody told me, don\u2122t work for the consulate because they might take you back to Poland or persecute your family if you don\u2122t go back, and they switched me to this new office, commerce and trade representative\u2122s office. And I Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 119was there and I really stopped going to school because he had so much work, so I s \u0152 interrupted my studies.

And of course there is this group of people sitting and asking me, did you get paid for the \u0152 no, this man, this captain says, but she work for the Americans, she work for the CIC. No, it was called different in those days, it wasn\u2122t CIC, it was this something intelligence service. And they ask me, oh did you \u0152 oh yeah, and this friend of mine said ma \u0152 re-remember that when sh e has to go to the States that you vouch for her that she work fo r the Americans. And so he says well \u0152 just then somebody who was asking me sa ys, well did you get money for it? And I said, why should I have gotten money for it? I mean, I \u0152 I didn\u2122t like the Soviets and I didn\u2122t like the Polish government, and that was it. And that\u2122s \u0152 I didn\u2122t do anything outrageous, all I did is translated stuff. And \u0152 but I almost got rejected for the emigration, but then all of a sudden I got this call and this lady says there\u2122s somebody wanting to talk to you. And I said, who on earth can it be? Ba \u0152 she didn't understand the name. It turned out to be the boss of this intelligence service, who says, don\u2122t worry, your papers have been cl eared. And he said, you work for us and I just \u0152 only by chance did he come across my papers.

            "answer": "I lived with this family in this \u0152 sleeping on a cot and all that. And \u0152 but the school was way \u0152 I don\u2122t know how \u0152 oh yes, and the girls said, you know, they said there\u2122s a Polish invasion in the \u0152 i-in this match \u0152 Universal Match Company. A bunch of foreigners getting work and all that. And you know, it\u2122d be better if you didn\u2122t work here, because it\u2122s gonna be bad for me, too. So there I was, and that was at noon and we always went to the YMCA to eat. And I was crying all the way and there was a blonde woman sitting there and sh e says, what is she crying about? And she knew this girl. And she says, ah, becaus e she just lost her work. And she \u0152 this woman says something \u0152 somehow it ca \u0152 wa \u0152 came to tell me, she says oh, she can come and stay with us, and we\u2122re gonna lo ok for a job for her. Because the office \u0152 not the office, but the universal \u0152 the offi ce of the Universal Match Company, the headquarters is really n-near where we live. And so I went to live with them, was the family of a mother and three sisters. One sister, the one that \u0152 Blondie, or Bonnie, who took me in, and two sisters from the other father. And it turned out \u0152 she later told me that she only \u0152 oh yeah, the sister said, oh sh e only took her in so there would be two against two, because they we re always quarreling about who is a better person in this family. But anyhow, they took me to this office in Ferguson and the \u0152 to this Universal Match Comp any and the director of wh oever the personnel office Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 124is. Oh sorry, but we don\u2122t have any work for her. And I started crying and I said, gosh, after all this. I don\u2122 t know, somehow I mentioned the word camps. The minute I said the word camps, the guy woke up and he says, what camps? And of course the directors were all Jewish, to say the tra \u0152 to say the least. And he says, what camp? And I says, through the tears and I said, well this and that and all that. And he tooks \u0152 picks up the telephone and he calls up th e office of the Universal Match Company in Saint Louis and he says, I need that work for a person that you just let go. She\u2122s a typist. And, do you take shorthand? And I say yeah, a little bit, but not very \u0152 yeah, I knew Polish and German shorthand, so I al ways took notes in German shorthand, but \u0152 anyhow, so \u0152 and I was so lucky that next to \u0152 across the street from the girls where I lived, lived one of the personnel \u0152 one of \u0152 somebody there lived who also worked in Universal Match Company, so he would take me home and bring me back. You have to get up five o\u2122clock becau se it was far away fro m this \u0152 yeah, ferg \u0152 was called Ferguson , I think. And so, I started working and I start first time on an electric typewriter. And I was used to this regular typewriter. So I \u0152 I hit this type \u0152 I mean, you know, I hit this thing and somebody says, thanks God this \u0152 it\u2122s look as if this typewriter was gonna float \u0152 fly out through the window. But somebody says thanks God sh \u0152 she \u0152 the windows were closed because otherwise I don\u2122t know what would happen. You know, I was at seventh or eighth floor, or tenth, I don\u2122t know. But anyhow, ni \u0152 so I worked there, and I stayed with the girls, but since I Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 125was starting going to school, it was so diffi cult for me because I had after cl \u0152 after work I went to school, to night school at Washington U. And I\u2122m just coming home, I was asleep and I was holding onto this st rap in a bus and the ba \u0152 guy would say, sleeping beauty, time to get up, you arrived. And so I said I got to look for another place to live. So I was looking and I was going through this Washington Street, I think, and every place it says for rent, for rent, and it \u0152 then I see this one it says for rent, for rent, and it was just cl \u0152 you know , in the middle between work and school. But it says, no women wanted or someth i \u0152 only from \u0152 only for men. I don\u2122t remember the wording on this thing. And so , as I pass by, the two old ladies were sitting on a porch and I look at the sign and I pass by. And one of them gets up and she says, aren\u2122t you gonna come in? And I say, why I\u2122m a woman, I can\u2122t come in. And I was dressed up, you know, to kill. And so what are you looking for? And I say, well, I\u2122m looking for a place, because I live in Ferguson , it\u2122s too far for me to school, between work and school. She says , well, why don\u2122t you look at the room? So, take me up. She took me upstairs and I went upstairs and this and that and I said, well how about cooking facilities? And she says, well, we don\u2122t let anybody cook, but if you promise that you never leave any dirty dishes and that you \u0152 and we give you a little place. She evidently liked me, okay? And so I stayed with them. I stayed with them until I got married."

And so I went and I got accepted and I had some credits from Washington U ., except they were not all acc \u0152 accepted in Frostburg because they have their own standards and all that.

And I got it, but my husband never told his mother that I got that citizenship, she had to read it in the newspaper. Cause they took the pi cture with a \u0152 the senator from Maryland was Bell, and there was some Italian lady to o who \u0152 in a small town, you know, something like that, to be \u0152 to be a citizen is a big deal, you know, not \u0152 not as in other place where you have hundred of them, you know."

I couldn\u2122t da \u0152 I couldn\u2122t wait til I could vote, I mean, that was my thing, cause you hear \u0152 that was Eisenhower at that time and they said, but you are a democrat, and I wasn\u2122t a democrat, I was really a repu blican at that time. And of course Eisenhower was my liberator, so I voted for him. But then \u0152 then when I was in school in Frostburg, I had to make extra money after my husband left, and I work in a kitchen. And I lived in a house where there was a restaurant dow-downstairs and then we live upstairs. And so it was the easiest work for me because I didn't have to Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 138get dressed or anything like that. And I could leave the boy upstairs and the people from the hotel were watching him. But I didn\u2122t leave him upstairs, I \u0152 really he came with me and he was painting and drawing and sometimes he would fill the saltshakers and all that.

Well, you give this to his hand and he holds your hand. He asks you for a date and all that kind of stuff. And I said, but you are marrie d, cause you can see. And he says, well, that doesn\u2122t matter. So that\u2122s how I say, oh my gosh, I can\u2122t work like that and then study and all this. So there was the \u0152 he says, well the only other job he says, to wash dishes. And so I went to wash dishes, but my son was always showing \u0152 there\u2122s a peephole and he was showing people that his mother is working washing dishes. Well \u0152 and well, I wouldn\u2122t have stopped th is work except that one day I put my chemistry notes al \u0152 on this washing m achine, and when I open it, you know, the \u0152 the damp, or \u0152"

And then \u0152 then I no \u0152 by that time I graduated, and I already had this job waiting for me, so anyways [indecipherable] [tape break] Well, anyhow , Janet Levin was \u0152 I met Janet Levin in Cumberland and before I met Janet Levin I knew a Jewish family, a furrier\u2122s family that I went to visit and \u0152 and I saw the Hanukkah candle and so she says , oh how do you \u0152 I said, when is Hanukkah? And she said, how do you know about Hanukah? And I said well, I come from a place that has every fra \u0152 fifth person is a Jew, so you have to know about Hanukkah.

And this redhead comes to me and says, you waiting for somebody? And I sa y yes, for the rabbi. Oh, there he is. Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 140And I said, where? And she says there, there, the man at the door, shaking hands with the people. I said, that\u2122s not a rabbi. You sure he\u2122s a rabbi? I ought to know, he\u2122s my husband.

            "answer": "Well, I do \u0152 in the very beginning we would get applic ation that f \u0152 somebody is looking for mother, father, brother, whatever it is, so there are certain forms, specially the forms \u0152 the forms were different [indecipherable] in every year the forms got \u0152 were changed just to \u0152 to make it easier because the \u0152 you get an application from us, and we send this to the international tracing service in Arolsen. And then they look in the papers and course they have all their lists, and if anybody Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 142can find anybody, it\u2122s supposed to be ther e. Because there were \u0152 but however it\u2122s difficult because before the Gestapo and the SS left, they burned most of their materials. So it\u2122s very difficult to \u0152 to really find somebody. You can never find names, for example, of \u0152 right after the war, when Poland lost the war, all the Jewish synagogues were burned, and po \u0152 Jewish popula tion\u2122s registers was kept by \u0152 by the synagogues, the birth and the ma rriage records and all that. So once the synagogue was burned, that was it. And be n \u0152 then besides, since the Jews never lived together with the Poles, or the very few Pole \u0152 Poles knew the Jews and the Jews knew the Poles. They only knew each other in commercial situations, but not that I could go \u0152 some \u0152 somebody could sw ear yeah, I know this \u0152 this Jew came from this and this place, or this. So we can\u2122t really find anybody like that. Besides, what they did sometimes, they got this whole Jewish population on the side of some river or something and shot them, or what ever it was. And in the very beginning it was like that. And \u0152 course they didn\u2122t us e them for work like they did later, they just got smarter [indecipherable] smarter in quotation marks. And so it\u2122s \u0152 so we were looking for these people, but it\u2122s very difficult to find it, especially women. But seems like men, who were then put to work, were easier to trace, whereas women and children were shot before they were even put to work or anything like that, so \u0152 so what we did, we would just write out the names and professions and where they were born and all that, and you think possible that could facilitate the finding.

And I co \u0152 you read the Jewish diaries and m \u0152 I\u2122m \u0152 was like he was occ upied with the Gestapo files, and \u0152 but Morris was reading those diaries and he had to summarize them, and then lots of time I did that for him too, so \u0152 and it\u2122s \u0152 it was really heartbreaking sometimes.

And in the archives we were looking in the death books and we found ab out 40,000 names for the Red Cross, for the tracing service, and got the little certificate from Mrs. Dole for \u0152 for dedicated work and all this kind of stuff.

That\u2122s the insight that I got. And I don\u2122t know on the other hand \u0152 no, that\u2122s not maybe in the museum I didn't learn that, but I was as king myself, how would \u0152 you know, when you hear all this at \u0152 anti-Polish expressions, how we \u0152 how we have killed the Jews, and how we didn\u2122t help an d all that. Nobody ever \u0152 I don\u2122t know somebody \u0152 I wrote to the paper and was published, too. Like, for example, the present te \u0152 two organizations that, where the Jewish mothers threw their children through the floor traps, somebody would pick them up, and I \u0152 I was serving on one of those \u0152 how is it, stations, so to say. If you saw a train that was coming through and has a certain markings, which meant there were children on it. Now, didn\u2122t say Jewish children or Polish children, but there were some markings on the trains that \u0152 that you knew there were children, and you had to tell somebody else that so and so train passed Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 155through this station. And there were \u0152 th en you knew that someplace between one place and the other, there could have been a child who was dropped through the floor. And then the \u0152 somebody would see to it that the child was picked up. And this was all organized, and I think it was orga nized by the present pope, I think, of \u0152 he wasn\u2122t a pope then, of course. But it wa s all organized this way to pick up the children that were dropped, so \u0152 and it \u0152 nobody even k nows about it. And it\u2122s true, there were [indecipherable] and were bad people, like in every nation you had bad people. But why should I be paying and be responsible for people who were bad? And yet, it\u2122s just because I\u2122m saying I\u2122m Polish, the mother sa ys, huh oh. I mean, it happens very often. I mean, in Red Cross there was this new worker there and she says to me, ah, the Poles were so horrible to the Jews, killed them during \u0152 and she is not even Jewish. And she says \u0152 and I said , who told you stuff like that? Absolute there were people like that, but they weren\u2122t any better than the J-Jewish O.D. I mean, you know what O.D. is? Ordnungsdienst , so the Jewish police. I mean, it was just as cruel as the Polish police or anybody else. I mean, and you \u0152 nobody \u0152 they were more hated in the ghetto some \u0152 for example, than \u0152 than even the Polish police, cause you can always bribe the Polish police. And of course I understand the \u0152 the Ordnungsdienst , or the yi \u0152 Jewish police, they wanted to stay alive, so \u0152 I mean, this whole idea was that everybody who was in this situation had to \u0152 wanted to survive, and the will to survive makes you do things that \u0152 I don\u2122t know what I Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 156would do if it was I who had to decide, wh o had to fight for my life, and f \u0152 and make a \u0152 prolong it for one or two or thr ee days. Of course, ther \u0152 you were always promised you\u2122re gonna stay alive longer. And I mean, the insight probably that I gain is that you never know what you would do in a gi ven situation, that no matter how much I b \u0152 was taught about this forg ive our trespasses, love your brother like your own, like yourself. I don\u2122t know what I would do, if I were pushed toward the wall. If my back was toward the wall, what would I do? And for God to judge people. I don\u2122t know if we have the right to do it. Like the Indians say, don\u2122t judge a person until you walk in his moccasins. And that\u2122s the truest truth there is, really."

Oh no, of course not. And so that\u2122s why I sit down to write the book, but you know how \u0152 I was teaching and raising a son, I didn\u2122t have that much time to write a book.

So finally the guy said, if they sell 1,000 and the editor, I mean the publisher says 1,000 Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 159copies, then I get some \u0152 and the \u0152 his fina ncial assistant said 1,500. And so I\u2122m not gonna wait for that, okay? The fact is that I put down so mething so that those who come after us knows what this generation of us went through and yet somehow survived. And I think that the reason why we really survive is the 20 years of po \u0152 Polish independence, cause then we were \u0152 after the 123 years of being taken by Russians, Prussians and Austrians, in this free Poland, the Pilsudski\u2122s free Poland, we \u0152 it was imbued in this crowd of the old Poland, and I always was in this camp of this nation of a ma \u0152 kingdom or repu blic of free nations, you know how that if you le \u0152 stick together instead of qua rrel, you can be somebody. And I always wanted Poland to be multi-culture and multi-religious. And I had this teacher who always \u0152 in elementary school, who al ways complain how dumb the Polish government is and those national democrats and all and this \u0152 and so finally \u0152 and we finally said well, can you tell us when Poland was really big? And \u0152 and she says, I\u2122ll tell you. And she said, when th e Russian Greek \u0152 no, when the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox pre \u0152 prince said to his son, whom he sent to Italy to study, remember son, you are a Pole. He says, that\u2122s where Poland could be proud of herself. And that stuck with me so that \u0152 of course that\u2122s impossible in this situation, when all those new ethnical quarrels and all this. I mean, people somehow didn\u2122t know that you can live in peace, speaking a different language, pursuing a different religion, and \u0152 and I mean, and live in pe ace in one country. Somehow people just Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 160don\u2122t see it, you can see it now, Africa or Yugoslavia , wherever we are, you see the same old stuff, this hatred.

And she sa \u0152 no, because I always see the downside of life. And I said, when you l ook around, there is no up side. There are the rich and there are the poor. There are the educated and uneducated. And I know it\u2122s the fault of an uneducated who drop from school and all that. And I see it\u2122s the \u0152 every religious \u0152 whether it be a rabbi or a priest or whoever the others ones, they all preach their own catechism and \u0152 but I said, but now, since we \u0152 since I see the Catholic church said we \u0152 not every \u0152 I have to \u0152 have to tell this to Mr. Rosen, but this \u0152 this writing in the bulletin and says something about [indecipherable] yeah, something about the desert through which our ancestors fr \u0152 no, it\u2122s talking aya \u0152 in the life, working through life as in a \u0152 like our spiritual forefather or faithful father \u0152 yeah, I got my faithful fathers walked through the desert, as they coming back, th-this Judeo-Christian idea. And \u0152 but to see that written in a bulletin, that\u2122s kind of \u0152 I mean, that\u2122s a totally different aspect as you have seen, let\u2122s say, even 20 years ago, before this pope. And I \u0152 I think that \u0152 but then you own the other \u0152 the Christian and the Jews can get together now, but how about the Arabs and the Jews? I mean, this idea of killing \u0152 going to heaven when you kill an enemy? I mean it\u2122s just so Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 161inhuman, the whole thought is inhuman.

I really stopped being religious. I go to church by tradition and I know there isn\u2122t \u0152 there\u2122s got to be somebody, cause even there wasn\u2122t, we have to invent him to make sens e in life. What for how, why, but when \u0152 I mean, and I\u2122m not the only one, there are lots of Jewish people who lost their faith because of that. I mean, when you really think what is \u0152 all this \u0152 so many people \u0152 I remember this one fellow who \u0152 who got a chicken and he says \u0152 and his mother wouldn\u2122t eat it, she\u2122d rather be hungry and skinny because it was not kosher chicken. Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 166I mean, here the guy goes through all this trouble to buy this ch icken and his mother refuses to eat because it\u2122s not kosher. I mean, it\u2122s \u0152 I understand, walking through the desert you had to keep your hygiene so that you stay alive, cause the \u0152 not enough water and \u0152 and p-plagues and bad food could just kill a whole family, whole tribe. But I mean, in modern times? But that \u0152 that was what makes me \u0152 what made me really not believe.

And then \u0152 but when I\u2122m in that church, I pray, and I say this Our Father and all this. And of course \u0152 an-and the reason why I really don\u2122t see any af \u0152 saw any anti-Semitism is because you always read this first old Bible, you know the \u0152 you know the \u0152 they is \u0152 and then be \u0152 the Bible, the story from the Bible \u0152"

Do you think you would be a different person today if you ha dn\u2122t gone through the experiences that you went thro ugh as a young \u0152 young woman?",
            "answer": "Well, definitely I would. In the first place I wouldn\u2122t have met so many people and learned that among the bad ones, there are good ones. And that people are all the same, no matter where they are. And you \u0152 you have to forgive the bad ones and have \u0152 thank God that you met some good one s.

And you-your \u0152 when you have your own children you try to make them citizens of the world so that we see that everybody is \u0152 that we all human and you\u2122re never really successful, because sometimes, I see by my own son that not all Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 168people are the same \u0152 or have the same value in his eyes. So I wasn\u2122t very successful, although I tried. But there\u2122s nothing that we can do but hope, and try to be better. And I tried, and sometimes I fa ll back and say bad things about other people. I try not to, but that\u2122s a very human thing, you bl ame somebody else for your own unhappiness and so \u0152 but I never, never made a difference between a Jew, or a Catholic or a German or a French, or an English if she was a good person."

But I also know that power and greed can buy certain rights and political power, and that you have to watch out for that. Because I\u2122m too old to do anything about it, but if \u0152 one thing I know for sure, that I always will be voting, because if you don\u2122t vote, you \u0152 you have nothing to complain about later on, if things go wrong.

And that this whole horror was brought to me by this death of Jan Karski, who \u0152 who tried so bravely to na \u0152 to \u0152 to tell the world ab out what\u2122s going on and nobody would listen to him. And whenever I think about har \u0152 an d about how this man felt, that he failed, he \u0152 in his life, because despite all he tried, he couldn\u2122t move anybody to do anything. On the other hand, I don\u2122t know wh at he expected people to do, and what could have been done. But i-it\u2122s ju st he, when I first saw him, o-on Lehrman Miles with us, his goodbye dinner or something, you know, and he \u0152 he was talking about how Mr. Lehrman Miles help him after his wife died, and then Mr. Miles said the same thing about him, how wonderful Karski was, and how a courageous man. But I know that he felt, yeah, from the talk \u0152 talking \u0152 from talking with him, he knew that he felt that he really didn\u2122t \u0152 didn\u2122t do \u0152 that he failed to do what he wanted to do. But then, it\u2122s easy to judge again, without knowing. And even American Jewry didn\u2122t do anything, but on the other hand I understand they were afraid of a Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure February 2, 2001 173backlash. And so this worl \u0152 life is so complicated. There\u2122s no such a thing like a easy, straight line. And everybody brings in to this life his own dislikes and likes, his own ideas, and they always in conflict with somebody else\u2122s. And the wisdom is \u0152 or would be, t-to do the right thing, but how many of us think about it? Not everybody can think that clearly and long distance. Then we have our own problems, and everybody\u2122s involved in our own life and pr \u0152 solving our problems, and it\u2122s not easy to live. So that\u2122s why probably people are believi ng in God, because this \u0152 without knowing that \u0152 believing that there is something up there, or wherever, in space, life would be worthless. That\u2122s it."
