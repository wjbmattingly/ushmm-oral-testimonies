And it was interesting to, before that, that the V-1s that they were firing on England, they were these kind of a putt, you hear them flapping, cause they had a \u2014a pulse jet motor on them, and you\u2019d hear those at night. And as long as they weren\u2019t coming right over your head. Why? Because they didn\u2019t steer them, they just had an angle, wherever they go, and then they would kick the rudder over and \u2014 the horizontal stabilizers rather, and they just dive straight down. The British developed a technique to keep those from coming into England. They had a fighter \u2014 real big fighters called nape \u2014 Typhoon, with a Napier Sabre big engine on it. Wasn\u2019t \u2014 I guess it was too heavy to be a real good fighter like the Spitfire. And they would send those out over the Channel when they hear \u2014 see these things coming in, cause they flew at a certain altitude, and the Typhoons would fly along Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Chasten Bowen _ April 26, 2013 the side of them and flap the wing on them and tip the gyro in, and they just spiral into the ocean. So the British really did a good job on downing many, many hundreds of those darn B-I1s."

And then we went on to our target, 1t was a dru \u2014 it was an underground airbase, fighter base, and they had caves and stuff in these hills where they\u2019d put the fires inside, and everything was camouflaged, so it was a hard thing to find, but they were trying to knock out as much of those fighters as they could because of the invasion forces, you know. So we made a \u2014 went out and found the initial point, which is an identifiable point that you \u2014 they can find to turn on, and they drove cer \u2014 certain altitudes, certain speed and in a certain direction, and to the target. We met the first time and that \u2014 the bombardier couldn\u2019t find the target, camouflaged. So you do a no-no, we \u2014 we made a 360 degree turn and went back to same initial point and started the same course, same altitude, same everything. By that time the barrage flak that you see all the time hadn't got us the first time, so they had their tracking flak on us in. They knew our altitude, our course, they knew where we were going. So the tail gunner says, about 300 yards off the tail, had a burst. Next one through the waist, and the left wing wen-went off, and we caught on fire and started into a spiral. And I always figured I\u2019d ride the airplane down, get out of the crash or Interview with Chasten Bowen \" April 26, 2013 something. But you change your mind rather quickly when that happens, so I \u2014 guys just bailing out, you know, when they gave the order to bail out.

And he pointed the guns down and the handles come up and I flipped it out and he pops out. He was a little guy, and he popped out of there so quick I couldn\u2019t believe it.

And so we\u2019d always been told to delay your jump, cause they may \u2014 may shoot you coming down in the parachute, you know, a fighter come by, or something like that. So I had delayed my parachute til I could kind of see the leaves on the trees. And I popped the chute and it seemed like I took a couple swings and I was on the ground. And then there was a\u2014a little boy, a lady, and a \u2014 at the end of this field where I landed in, there was a little boy over there and a lady, and so I \u2014 he ran over towards me and I reached in my kneepads to get my escape kit out and there\u2019s a little \u2014 we have books in there, a little book that says English and French, you know, cause we [indecipherable] France, and maps and stuff. And he pointed the [indecipherable] in the book, and he says hide, in there. So they took off. So I stuck my parachute under some bushes there at the edge of the field, and ran through the forest and got to the other side and I didn\u2019t know going to the other side is that I was getting deeper in the forest, but I come to a clearing. Now that little boy don\u2019t want to go out in there, cause gonna see me. So I just heard these \u2014 all these Germans running, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Chasten Bowen \u00a9 April 26, 2013 you could hear them, and there\u2019s \u2014 their canister they carry with them is \u2014 their gas mask rattles like a tin can, you know, so I heard rattling, so I just dove under some bushes right there and pulled them down kind of over me and laid there, waited, and hear when the Germans come up, he\u2019s \u2014 I could reach out and grab his pant leg, he was so close, but he was looking way out ahead, he wasn\u2019t looking down at his feet. And I don\u2019t know, it seemed like I laid there for a day, 1t was probably an hour or something like that, and he kept looking out there, and I didn\u2019t breathe for a couple hours, I don\u2019t think. But anyhow, they finally went away and then I just walked through the forest and \u2014 and I got my maps and there \u2014 they had maps that they gave you were like a silk handkerchief, but their maps were detailed, they had the curves in the road, you could see paths in the forest, and they had \u2014 I don\u2019t know where I got them, but they were very good. So I saw a curve in the road and it\u2019s where I was at, and I located myself and then I started out to cross this one road, a divided highway. And then I heard a big racket coming, I was right in the middle of it, it was quite wide, their divided highway was, and there\u2019s grass and s \u2014 lot of trees growing in the middle of it. And around the corner I get \u2014 hear them coming. So I dove into the grass and hear a bunch of German tanks and everything else was coming by, and guys in, I don\u2019t know, looked like armored cars or something, I didn\u2019t \u2014 I wasn\u2019t able to really look, I was \u2014 buried myself in the grass, hoping they Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 didn\u2019t see me. And they went on by, didn\u2019t see me, so I thought[indecipherable] get out of here, so I headed back. And every time I seen one walking, I would just veer off at an angle. I wouldn\u2019t walk close to them, cause they\u2019d see me, identify me. So I just kept quite a ways away, and veer off at an angle. I never made any sharp turns or quick turns or anything like that, and finally I came to this forest area, and I ran across an old deserted \u2014 I don\u2019t know was a pigpen or whatever it was, but it was pretty dilapidated. So I went in there cause it had been raining, and I got all wet and stuff like that. So I took off my coveralls, cause I had coveralls with suspenders and stuff, my flight suit. So hung up on the thing in the top of it there, and laid down on the straw, and went to bed. And then the next morning, early the next morning, I don\u2019t know, seven \u2014 six, seven o\u2019clock, or what time it was, but I heard crack \u2014 like sticks breaking, and stuff like that, and I peek out. Here is a guy out there, I thought he was an old man, it looks pre \u2014 he was probably 40 years old, cause I was only 19. And so I didn\u2019t know what to do, I had my .45 automatic, pil \u2014 you know, shoulder holster and sa \u2014 I says, I don\u2019t know whether to shoot at the guy, or make a noise in the \u2014 I had to make a decision real quick here. So I thought no, I stuck the gun in the straw, and I stepped out to the door, pulled the \u2014 and peeked out to him. And he put his finger up to his mouth like be quiet. And he says [indecipherable]. I didn\u2019t know French, but I thought that meant friend or Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Chasten Bowen a April 26, 2013 something. So he says, shh. So he left. And so about 10 - 15 minutes later, here he come back. Started motioning me to come with him. So I reluctantly went with him."

We drove into Versailles, dropped the girl \u2014 lady off and the little boy off in Versailles, and we wer \u2014 thought it was kind of strange, we went through some roadblocks just right on through, you slowed down and right on through. We thought boy, that\u2019s sort of strange. They told us it wa \u2014 he was a doctor, he could get through, you know, real easy cause he had the, I guess I.D. or something. But we were kind of shaken. Anyway, we went \u2014 then he left them there, we went into Paris. We ended up getting driven right into Gestapo headquarters. So, kind of surprised. So they \u2014 we went \u2014 they had the machine guns all around, and then we separated so \u2014 we walked up these stairs, second floor and down the hall, and the other Germans there, they\u2019re standing against the hall like they were afraid of us. They\u2019d stand way back [indecipherable] walking down the hall. And they Interview with Chasten Bowen \u00b0 April 26, 2013 separated Jim and I and I don\u2019t know where the prin \u2014 the British kid go \u2014 went either, but I know Jim and I were on the same floor up there, but he was 1n another room. And I went into this room, there was a lady and a German guy there, and he spoke English, and she was taking \u2014 writing all this stuff down. And so they started, you know, searching us and stuff like that. And I had my wristwatch and \u2014 and \u2014 up around my arm, up here. But they took my dog tags, I had them in my shoes and they took everything, just took everything off of us, you know, and \u2014 and put it ina si\u2014 in a\u2014a ba\u2014a bag there, in a big envelope. And I said, can I write my name on it or something like that? And he says no need, bury you in two days. But they didn\u2019t put my name on it. And th-the watch I had was not my military watch, it was issue watch, but \u2014 cause I had given that to the navigator cause that day he said his watch didn\u2019t work, and so I had mine and I had a gold watch that my mother had given me for graduating from school, so I wore it. But I had slipped it up here around my elbow. Anyway, took everything. So, from then on, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know, they just took us back and finally after that they took us to French prison.

Cause I thought I was already dead, you know, I just crossed the bridge there for some reason and I just \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014I don\u2019t know why it come over me, I was just totally calm, I thought sh \u2014 I\u2019m dead, go ahead and shoot me, you know, didn\u2019t make any Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Chasten Bowen \u201c April 26, 2013 difference.

And they wanted to know squadron, and all that good stuff. They had all that data, I found out later. But, anyway, they finally gave up and put me back in a cell, and I went ina cell for 38 days in solitary, and \u2014"

They\u2019ll even have a Red Cross on it, to think sir \u2014 from the Red Cross or something.

So I just didn\u2019t sign it, and dil \u2014 I gotta say, he got a little upset over that, but \u2014 and put me in solitary and then they would come in \u2014 th-the old prison, I don\u2019t know if you know about French prison, they have the ol-old type doors. The doors are about three inches thick, I think, wooden doors, you know, and they had this little trap door up the top, over door that they could open and slide a Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Chasten Bowen \u201d April 26, 2013 bowl of soup in to you. And tha \u2014 and that, they had a little peephole, and they had a \u2014 one light on the side of this, in the room there, that they could turn on a switch on the outside and light the light, and in the corner you had a little carved out place there in cement, that had a little water spigot, and that was the toilet also there. And had straw on \u2014 on the fl \u2014 you know, a little place for you to sleep. Anyway, I \u2014 they\u2019d \u2014 they\u2019d come by and flip that light on and that little \u2014 you could hear them peeking \u2014 that little thing and peeking at you, you know, every once in a while. So I decided that I didn\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t know why I did it, but I took my little soup bowl I had, they put in there, and I propped it up on this little shelf in there so it covered their peek hole. Shouldn\u2019t have done that. Anyway, come along, pe \u2014 turned on the light, I guess, and couldn\u2019t see in. And boy, I heard the awful-est racket you ever heard out there. There\u2019s guys running, and you could hear their canisters clanging, their gas masks things and everything. Pretty soon they opened the door, about two or three of them are there, and they come in and started knocking me all around the room, and \u2014 trying to teach me a lesson, you know. And then they left. And I was \u2014 and I spent my time picking fleas, because they had lice, or fleas in there, and the fleas would get in the seams of your clothes, you know, and as a good pastime, cause they\u2019d bite you all over, and I was taking \u2014 you could feel along, little hard things and you\u2019d crunch them, you\u2019d break their shells, you know. So that was our Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Chasten Bowen * April 26, 2013 pastime. And then we\u2019d tap on the wall, cause there were other prisoners there. And there were some points you could tap and you could read the Morse code there.

            "answer": "Just a \u2014 trying to ask questions. They heard something like they were bombing at night, and you\u2019d hear people screaming, women and men and you heard noises all night long, you hear sh \u2014 gunshots, you don\u2019t know what was going on. And I heard later they were probably torturing people out there, you know, the ai \u2014 they \u2014 cause they had a lot of the French underground people they\u2019d caught also. And once I was taken out to a little courtyard, you had a wa \u2014 a kind of a balcony thing up there, where the guard kept walking back and forth. And then they had this little area there, and you walk around some, I guess that was your exercise room, you know. It was \u2014 it was penned in, but it was about probably 20 feet square, you could just walk around this little path around the square for exercise. And you could see carvings on the wall where people had been there from the 1800s or something like that. It\u2019s an old, old prison, but all the limestone walls, people scratched their names and stuff in it, you know, it was kind of intriguing to see all the people that had probably been there before. Cause it\u2019s an old, old prison, so \u2014 for France. And Interview with Chasten Bowen * April 26, 2013 anyway, finally, when you got, I guess as \u2014 Americans were about, I don\u2019t know, who knows, 12 - 15 miles away, maybe ma \u2014 further, but there was shelling going on, you could hear it all night long, the cannons and stuff. And then it started getting pretty noisy. And so, all of a sudden the \u2014 they evacuated us, took us out, took us all and put us in those boxcars. And they putting 90 of us in one of those boxcars, and we had to stand up. And they put a barrel in the center, cut off half a barrel and that was a toilet and everything, you know, sloshing around there. And so they \u2014 we didn\u2019t know where we were going, you know, we thought we were going to be taken out of there to a POW camp, or something, you know, but we ended up going so far and then we came to a tunnel. And apparently the Americans or someone [indecipherable] someone had bombed the tunnel shut. And so we were in there for quite a few hours, and it got smoky and really bad. And so \u2014 then they took us all \u2014 all these boxcars and made us take the German, I don\u2019t know, backpacks and boxes and things that we carry clothing. And we walk \u2014 followed them down a road and then across a bridge to the other side of this river, up the other side, and then we went through a little village and the \u2014 the French people were out there throwing us apples and some food and stuff like that. And the Germans were trying to keep them from it, but they\u2019d still throw the stuff, you know, and we\u2019d catch something. And then we got to a train on the other side where Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Chasten Bowen * April 26, 2013 the tunnel had \u2014 was \u2014 was \u2014 you know, where the tunnel had been closed, we \u2014 they had backed a train up at the other side. We boarded that train and went onto \u2014 we didn\u2019t know where we\u2019re going, but I guess we got to Frankfurt, I think, Germany. But before we got there, was going up a hill or something, it\u2019s kind of slow, and the tru \u2014 the boxcar right behind us, the \u2014 th-the guys had pried a board out of the bottom of the \u2014 I found out later, pried \u2014 and the guys were dropping out between the railroad tracks. And then, when the train was going up a hill, slowing down, why they\u2019d drop between the tracks and roll out between the wheels to get out from under there, because they had these scrapers that would go between it. So a few of the guys got out. I heard later on \u2014 I don\u2019t know this to be a fact, but I heard later on that one guy from Texas, he really escaped. He\u2019s the only guy I ever heard of ac-actually got away. So \u2014 but kind of a dangerous thing to do, but you know, was trying to get out of there, and then the \u2014 the one time they \u2014 they \u2014a French kid in our box car was hanging on one of the vents. On the opposite \u2014 cattywampus corners of the boxcar they had a vent about maybe eight or 10 inches high and about two feet long for a vent. They had barbed wire strung across it. And there was this French kid, he\u2019s about 18 years old, I guess, or so \u2014 fif\u2014 14 - 15, I don\u2019t know how old he was. And he had his hand up on this barbed wire, holding onto it, cause we were standing up in there. And the German guards on the outside Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Chasten Bowen * April 26, 2013 shot him right through the hand. And that\u2019s kind of crazy, you know, he\u2019s already in there. And anyway, then they stopped the car, they took him out. And \u2014 oh, before that, by the way, when these guys dropped out between the railroad tracks, they stopped the train, and they took about, I don\u2019t know, it must have been 10 or 15 guys out there beside the boxcar, lined them up like they were going to shoot them \u2014 cause we could look out through the cracks and see them, and they looked like they were going to shoot them, and then this German officer was hollering at them and stuff like that. And then we were told that there \u2014 every time \u2014 if anyone tried to escape they were going to kill 15 guys for every one that tried to escape. So they were trying to quiet us down, I guess. I wasn\u2019t going anywhere. And they took this young kid out, I was surprised. And I was looking out a crack in that boxcar. The German officer told him to \u2014 kind of motioned him down there. The tracks were raised, kind of sloped on the side, down to \u2014 there\u2019s a f\u2014 some fields down there, have been plowed and stuff. And there\u2019s a little irrigation ditch along the edge of tt. I looked down and I thought well, this German officer motioned this kid down there, I thought that he was going to have him go down, wash his hand off, cause it was bleeding and stuff like that. But as soon as he turned around, this German officer shot him right through the back. And the kid laid down and kind of kicked like, and one of the other guards there just raked him with a machine gun. And \u2014 Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Chasten Bowen ~ April 26, 2013 and then they took a couple of guys out of the boxcar and gave them shovels and made them go down there by the \u2014 right down close to that little ditch down there, and they \u2014 they weren\u2019t there very long. They dug a hole, and I don\u2019t think the thing was two feet deep. Threw this little kid in there and covered him up. And I thought, the mother will never know where that kid is.

And all of a sudden they popped a flair, like a lead bombardier always pops a flair and they s \u2014 the group tightens their formation, and they make a nice pattern.

And of course we ate those things like crazy. And w-we associated with all the other prisoners. There was a \u2014 right near \u2014 across from our barracks was a Polish barracks, and one day there was a big scuffle over there, you saw a whole bunch of them piling on some guy, and you wonder what happened. Well, later on I fou \u2014 h-heard that this one Polish guy had been at another camp, and apparently he had been a snitch or something like that. And I don\u2019t know if it was a fake, or what, but they said he knocked a bowl of soup out of one of the guy\u2019s hands. So a bunch of them jumped on him and put a blanket over his head and slugged him to death. It was just, you know, dog eat dog type attitude. And then they had these guys, you maybe heard of kapos, they were called kapos. These were German prisoners, but they had given them special rations to be \u2014 and they were all big guys, and they\u2019d give them a big board or a club, like a baseball bat, and they were to keep us other prisoners 1n line, to obey orders you Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Chasten Bowen \" April 26, 2013 know. Line up, do this, to go here. So everybody tried to stay away from those kapos. And so \u2014 but I used to talk to some of the Polish guys over there spoke English, and you \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard of the esso \u2014 SOE guys, they were British and \u2014 and some of them were Scottish, most of them British.

But I used to talk to some of those guys, and I found out two of them were from Scotland, they were twins, and one had had a scar up in his shoulder, and they put a scar on the other one\u2019s shoulder just like it. And they had \u2014 one would be up in Bremen, up in northern Germany, another would be down in Munich and something would happen, a big explosion or something would happen, they\u2019d catch this guy and \u2014 cause he was there, and he had the evidence, because you know, he\u2019d be \u2014 be real obvious around someplace, and he said no, I was, you know, here. I wasn\u2019t there. And here that they \u2014 they finally coupled the fact together that this \u2014 they were twins, and the Germans finally caught them both. And later on they were both killed.

But there were about \u2014 later on I found there were about, probably about 50,000 prisoners there, you know [indecipherable] 78,000, but they were dying off so fast, and I later fi \u2014 learned after the war that \u2014 from the archives at Buchenwald that the diet was designed to starve you to death in about three months. Keep cycling prisoners through there, cause they needed ru \u2014 labor, slave labor to work in the pri \u2014 in the factories and stuff, you know? So that was one way of just getting rid of them, starve them to death, rather than shoot them, or some go to \u2014 took energy and took people. I\u2019ve heard all sorts of rumors, I don\u2019t know why, but I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve heard that the \u2014 they used to lie in the \u2014 you\u2019ve seen where the pictures of the Jewish people lined Interview with Chasten Bowen \u201c April 26, 2013 up by ga \u2014 by these pits and they\u2019d shoot them and drop in the pits and they\u2019d cover them up. But the people that had to mow them down, those people had mental problems because they didn\u2019t \u2014 you know, they were killing other humans. So that\u2019s why the gas chambers came into being, so much. That was to \u2014 cause it wasn\u2019t such a personal thing. So \u2014 but it\u2019s [indecipherable] because when we stand up for appel to be counted, these SS guys would stand up there, they count your heads, and they had to have the count right in camp before they would excuse you, go back to the barracks, or where you\u2019re gonna go. Sometimes it\u2019d take three hours, and it \u2014 guys \u2014 some of the guys were \u2014 I weighed 82 pounds when I got out of there, s- some of the guys were skinnier than I was, couldn\u2019t stand up. And you\u2019d try to help them stand up, and the SS guys would wade in there and knock his brains out with a rifle butt, and make the prisoners put him on a gunny sack, four of them carry him over and stack him by the bodies by the crematorium now. So it\u2019s just \u2014 and there was these two wheel carts running around all day, picking up bodies and hauling them to the crematorium. So it was just not a very good environment. And you just wonder \u2014 I used to wonder about how can people be so cruel, and just \u2014 you\u2019re already prisoners, you know, why make it even worse? But we had a guy whose name the ger \u2014 the German SS guy up there was named Hauptman. And he would stand up there when we were out there, and ge \u2014 weather got kind of cool, and he Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Chasten Bowen \u201c April 26, 2013 had a little bucket, and he had a little cup in it, and he\u2019d say \u2014 he\u2019d pull back his uniform, show he had woolen underwear underneath. And he\u2019d say, cold, cold? And then he\u2019d throw \u2014 take a s-scoop up a bucket of this water \u2014 a scoop of this water and throw it out over us, you know, like spray us, you know, with a little bit of water. He\u2019d say cold? He just kind of tormented, you know. I don\u2019t know what he did it for, but it \u2014 how \u2014 I don\u2019t know how people get some enjoyment out of that. Anyway, that was my feeling. And one day the Americans came over and bombed the \u2014 when we were outside, I was telling you before, living outside on the rocks were \u2014 after that bombing, why, we were asked, will you come down and guide us? They said, if you were soldiers, you have the discipline to help us with the wounded. And they had a guy in there, I don\u2019t know h \u2014 the \u2014 he spoke a British accent, like he was \u2014 be-been trained in England or something, and he would talk to us, you know, he was the guy that they used for communication to us. And then the \u2014 they had another guy in there named \u2014 he was a Dutchman from du \u2014 Holland, he spoke good English and he spoke German also. So they\u2019d communicate through him, and he gave us lots of information. But anyway, they come down and got us, they says, you will help us with the wounded people in the bombing. Took us up there, and I didn\u2019t help anybody, cause I had no shoes, I was running through this fire and nails and stuff out there, and wood and stuff, and I was Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Chasten Bowen \u00b0 April 26, 2013 going as slow as I could. And I saw a wooden \u2014 wooden shoe laying over there, and so I kneeled down and put that wooden shoe on my left foot, and the German guards over there picked up some board and started beating me across the back, and you know, knocked the wind out of me. It seemed like I climbed \u2014 I crawled about a mile, probably about 20 feet, but it seemed like a mile, and just got \u2014 almost knocked me out, cause I couldn\u2019t hardly breathe, you know, knocked the wind out of me. And I didn\u2019t help anybody. I just act like I was help \u2014 trying to help some, put out the fire, something like that. I just went around, but I didn\u2019t do a darn thing, but no one bothered me after that. Finally, I went back to my building I was in, but I sure didn\u2019t help anybody. Some of the guys, I guess, had to help somebody, you know, I didn\u2019t. But anyway, when the Luftwaffe guy came through to look \u2014 he\u2019s \u2014 I guess he was going to say, look at the bomb damage, he told the \u2014 the other SS guys that. And he came in. Well, we had a guy, Ben Sharf(ph) from New Prague, Minnesota, he was our waist gunner. He spoke German from his ancestor was German. And so we said, Ben, you gotta go up, talk to the guy. Tell him we should be in a POW camp. So Jim Fore(ph) and I went up with him, close to him, and he s \u2014we told him salute the guy, so he\u2019s \u2014 Ben saluted him, and this German off \u2014 Luftwaffe officer, he kind of gives a real, slow salute. He didn\u2019t know what to do, I think, cause real slow he kind of went like this, real slow, put his hand down. And Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Chasten Bowen \u201c\u00b0 April 26, 2013 they talked a few minutes, and then the SS tried to break it up, and he pulled his rank on them and told them to stand back, and so he talked about five minutes to Ben, and he told Ben that they didn\u2019t work very good with the Gestapo and the SS, but he\u2019d do what he could, but we should be in a POW camp, he agreed. And we thought, well, that\u2019s encouraging news, but \u2014 and he left. And it was, I don\u2019t know, a month later, when I hear about a contingent of about 150 Luftwaffe people came into camp, round us up, took us and put into only about 30 - 40 in a boxcar and took us to Stalag Luft II over \u2014 over \u2014 over on the Polish border. So, man, and we got food, we got shoes, we got clothes. It was \u2014 it was like being in the Waldorf Astoria, you know. But it was really \u2014 really grateful th-that he came about. Now, I just found out recently that there\u2019s a book called, \u201cA Higher Call.\u201d And I had heard about a B-17 that had been shot down, riddled pretty badly, and it was down, oh 3,000 feet or so, and they\u2019d been throwing the radios out and the \u2014 the parachutes and everything to lighten plane, they\u2019d get back to England. Well, this \u2014 this German fighter flew right down beside him, wingtip to wingtip, and tried to motion, and \u2014 they \u2014 they couldn\u2019t communicate, but th-the pilot was Brown, Lieutenant Brown flying that B-17, trying to get back to England, and this German fighter pilot was trying to make a motion for him to go to England \u2014 I mean, go to fr \u2014 to Sweden, closer, across the Channel. And this book is called, \u201cA Higher Call.\u201d Interview with Chasten Bowen a April 26, 2013 Now, this German fighter pilot was a Catholic guy, and he had even some other fighter pilots with him, had gone to Goering and tried to resign and knock off some of the stuff they was doing, but they almost got shot over it. And this book is called, \u201cA Higher Call,\u201d and it\u2019s just recently come out. It\u2019s in English. I got a copy of it just this \u2014 this last month. It\u2019s quite intriguing to read, but this guy is the same guy that came into our camp, that got us out of there, and he got us out of there three days before the record \u2014 the record showing Buchenwald whatever, that we \u2014 we were supposed to be eliminated three days \u2014 and he got us out three days before we were supposed to all been killed. The orders had come down from Berlin. And this was just recently because this guy, Mike Dorsey, his father \u2014 his grandfather was in Buchenwald with us, his name was Easy(ph) Freeman(ph). And his grandfather started talking about it in recent years, I guess, and so Mike Dorsey was a movie producer, he decided to look into it, and he went back to Germany for almost a year research, and then went to all the archives in Buchenwald and everything. And he made this movie called, \u201cThe Lost Airman of Buchenwald,\u201d cause we had been lost because they didn\u2019t know where we were. We weren\u2019t in a POW camp until after the war they found where we were. So, that\u2019s the reason that movie is named that, but I\u2019m glad that he \u2014 his grandfather finally started talking about it, and he made this movie, and \u2014 and he \u2014 he even got \u2014 I was surprised, but when he Interview with Chasten Bowen . April 26, 2013 went back to Buchenwald, looked at all the records, he brought me back my arrest record, my Gestapo arrest picture, and the record of it. Shows USA, and then has it crossed out, and I think it says [indecipherable] or something up there on it."

And the German doctor there wanted to amputate my Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Chasten Bowen ~ April 26, 2013 leg right above the knee. And I \u2014 Captain Daniels, he was \u2014 we had Major jone \u2014 Davy Jones, and Captain Daniels, who were on the Doolittle raids in Tokyo unit. And they ended up in Europe and being shot down, and they were in our \u2014 south compound of the da \u2014 Stalag Luft III. Anyway, Captain Daniels there in the hospital and I said, no, no, no, I\u2014 you know, listen, I don\u2019t want my leg cut off. And so they talked to the German guy, Captain Daniels, and they decided, well, the only solution was to try to save would be to \u2014 they made kind of a tray, a curved tray they laid down on my leg, and they wrapped my leg with gauze about \u2014 looked like about two inches thick, and they hung it up at about a 20 - 30 degree angle, and they put a\u2014a-\u2014a metal bucket up there, hung it up there with a nail hole in it, dripping saltwater on it. And they dripped it on my toe, and it just run down the thing. I don\u2019t know if it was a month or something, it dripped \u2014 just dripped every day, it was just \u2014 it was miserable, just laying there, but you know \u2014 anyway it was a long time, I don\u2019t know how long it was, but that thing got \u2014 the whole thing got just like a big rock cast, cause all that salt and then it\u2019d evaporate, you know. And they come in one day and they said, well, we\u2019re gonna cut it off, see what we got. So they cut that \u2014all that gauze and stuff off of there, and it was just a \u20141f you\u2019ve ever seen a parched earth, it\u2019s just cracks and stuff and brown, and rotten looking thing. And then they squeezed it with this gauze and stuff, and the pus is squirt out around my Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Chasten Bowen * April 26, 2013 ankle, and it volcanoes up around my knee and stuff like that, and they\u2019d squeeze it and milk it a little bit. And it stunk like crazy. So he looked at it, and they sh \u2014 they kind of shook their heads, and they said, well, it\u2019s doing something, so they wrapped it up again, put the saltwater up there again and kept dripping it on there, and I don\u2019t know, seemed like a month, I don\u2019t know how long it was, really. And it got all hard again, they took it off, and it was starting to grow skin back. So they kept wrap \u2014 wrapping in gauze, and stuff like that, and they we \u2014 and they finally sent me back to the \u2014 my barracks back at the saw \u2014 compound, and I was there and I was \u2014 it was hard to walk on, but it was \u2014 I was limping around, and it was getting a little better all the time. And they would \u2014 I \u2014 I forget how often the \u2014 but they would rewrap it. I don\u2019t remember, my mind 1s gone, I guess, on how often, but every once in a while they\u2019d \u2014 every couple of days, why they\u2019d rewrap the leg, and I'd walk on it.

And so Colonel Clark, he was a colonel major \u2014 he was General Clark at Colorado Springs there, the air \u2014 air academy there later on, but he was a colonel in our camp there at south compound. Major Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Chasten Bowen *\u00b0 April 26, 2013 Davy Jones and Captain Daniels and Colonel Clark.

            "answer": "Well, you don\u2019t want the Russians to get ahold of us, they wanted to just keep us as prisoners, cause we were material that they could trade, or hold hostage, or something like that, you know. We just assumed that we were hostages to be held, and the more of us that they could keep, the \u2014 the better. And getting us away from the fronts, you know, and we ended up down at Moosburg, which was pretty crowded, had lots of prisoners there, you know. And then we heard rumors about the allies not too far away, and they \u2014 they had radio there too, you know, their secret radios, they had crystal sets. And I heard \u2014 we were told that \u2014 that if they tried to evacuate us from Moosburg to be \u2014 light a building on fire or something, cause they\u2019d have planes circling. And we noticed that at about 35,000 feet or something, way up in the sky, we\u2019d hear these airplanes, and once in a great while you could see one of them, but they\u2019re \u2014 just barely see them. And they were \u2014 Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 circled day and night, and they said, light a building on fire, something, if anything \u2014 they started to kill anybody or anything like that, and they would make an immediate attack on the camp. And we were shocked one day was \u2014 I was down by the gate cause there was a lot of commotion and stuff and the Germans were coming by, and there are tanks rolling by and everything else, and I think Captain he \u2014 and Captain Daniels was down there close to me too, and the German guards all of a sudden were running to a \u2014 one the buildings, their \u2014 their little guard shack there. And \u2014 and then we saw what was happening, the SS guy there, there was tank people out there, were telling the \u2014 motioning them to come out and help fight, I guess, cause we were right down there by the gate watching them, and all of a sudden one of these Germans put a Panzer fist, a German anti-tank gun right into those \u2014 his own guys, those Luftwaffe guys at the \u2014 at the gate in the building there, just blew it wide open. Holy mackerel, you know, what\u2019s going on, cause all hell was breaking loose, you know. You hear gunfire and cannon fire and everything else, and the Americans were shelling pretty high with large cannons, because you could look up to Moosburg and see the tar sliding off the roofs of the houses and stuff. So, was pretty noisy for a while, and all of a sudden the American tanks started coming by and we saw the goings on, and \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t five minutes behind the front lines, here come Patton, riding in a Jeep. It\u2019s ju \u2014 standing up in Interview with Chasten Bowen ~ April 26, 2013 his Jeep, and he motioned they \u2014 he motioned a tank or something, break down the fence, he come driving right inside the camp and stood up in his Jeep, and told everybody, you know, to be quiet or something. He gave a little talk and told us not to go into town, and stuff like that. And I was shocked to see him there, I was \u2014 you know, just dumbfounded. Here he had his pearl handled revolvers on, that you know, like, what was it \u2014 what\u2019s her name, some, you know, singer had given him, you know. And I-I was shocked, cause he wasn\u2019t five minutes for find the \u2014 behind the front lines. So we just stayed in camp and then they let us out, and I went up to where the Americans had put a pontoon bridge across the river up there, right in town, 1n the south side of town. And I went up there one time, and the \u2014 the \u2014 I was amazed that the engineers were out there putting a bridge back across the river; it had been cut loose. They were trying to get tanks across the river, and the Germans were up higher, shelling that down there to the river, and they cut the bri \u2014 their pontoon bridge loose one time, and it floated kind of down the river, and they had these little boats out there, outboard [indecipherable] towing that thing back up and con \u2014 reconnected. And shells were, you know, dropping in the water down in \u2014 above them there. I was shocked, I \u2014 now I realized, you know, I\u2019d be running and hiding, rather than being there, but you could see it, the splash of the water and stuff, from where we were. And I remember seeing that \u2014 that German flag come Interview with Chasten Bowen \u201c\" April 26, 2013 off that steeple up there in Moosburg, and the American flag go up. What a \u2014 what a feeling. You can\u2019t explain it. It\u2019s just \u2014"

I went to work for a guy that was \u2014 bought a TV, and then went in it myself. And RCA was advertising they were gonna make a \u2014 a projection tube, five inch projection tube. And they\u2019d had a little 10 inch table model TV. And Bausch and Lomb was talking about a lens for this RCA thing. So I was inquisitive, I called them up and asked RCA if I could get is \u2014 one of those tubes, and called Bausch and Lomb, see if I could get a lens, and I did it, and I took a 10 inch RCA TV and converted it to \u2014 made a little projection set. I put a 12 by 16 foot projection set in the Shrine Auditorium in 1947 for the Rose Bowl game and the Rose Parade. I sold 200 and \u2014 I sold 2400 s \u2014 I think \u2014 no, s \u2014 fe \u2014 was it \u2014 about a thousand seats anyway, at two dollars and 40 cents apiece for the whole Rose Bowl game and the Rose Parade. I \u2014 I \u2014 I was sweating that, because I had two of these little TV projector things made up, and with a RCA chassis because if one failed, I thought I\u2019d re \u2014 I\u2019d get shot if something happened. But I went to Bodie(ph) plastic screens, I could contact a guy in Hollywood that \u2014 cause I knew they made \u2014 you know, they had their experimental TVs and ther \u2014 not TVs, but projections up there. They already project them from the rear. So I got ahold of this Bodie(ph) plastic screen guy out in \u2014 1n Venice, made the screens, and asked him if he can make me a screen. So I had a 12 by 16 foot, they made a wooden frame and put this plastic on it, and they s \u2014 they\u2019d put the projector back there and ha-have a hot spot, and Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Chasten Bowen \u00b0\u00b0 April 26, 2013 they\u2019d spray with a \u2014 like a spray gun with plastic, and it would make it thicker in the center, so 1t made it even, the light even.

My grandkids, I\u2019m glad to say that I\u2014 I was able last year in April to \u2014 when I went to Buchenwald, and \u2014 by invitation of the Germans; my wife and I; my younger son and my grandkids; we took them, we went there, they were \u2014 spent a week at Buchenwald area, hearing all the speeches and seeing the graves and seeing all the history that took place there. And they were \u2014 my dau \u2014 granddaughter 1s fif \u2014 just turned 15, she\u2019s old enough to understand, she asked a lot of questions, so she was inquisitive. I just think more kids need to know about what really went on. I know that some of it is nasty and bad, but that\u2019s life. And protecting them and saying everything\u2019s just hunky dory and sm-smiley roses all the time is not the way real Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Chasten Bowen \u201d April 26, 2013 life is. So that part bothers me, I just \u2014 I-I just have strong feelings about our school system and things like that, I\u2014 I\u2019m bothered enough [indecipherable]. But it does, it bothers me a great deal that even grown-up people don\u2019t know. And [indecipherable] today, a lot of people still deny the Holocaust happened. How can they deny it with so much evidence and \u2014 and everything? And yet people, th-they seem to have their head in the sand, to me. And maybe I\u2019m just an old \u2014 ignorant old man, but I-I feel that people need to o-open their eyes and look around, cause we sure don\u2019t want to relive it. Anyway, that\u2019s my feelings, I just \u2014 you\u2019re stuck with them."
