            "answer": "I don\u2122t remember the exact day that we had there. I think there was training flights that we went just to the coast, turn around, come back, three of them. And Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 14then on the day of the \u0152 the bomb, when I fir \u0152 when I was shot down, why we got up quite early in the morni ng, about four o\u2122clock or something like that, I don\u2122t remember the exact time. It was early. Had the briefing and then we took off and we used to climb at certain altitudes [indecipherable] because you have a lot of airplanes up there. So they have a colored flares, and you have a \u0152 each plane has a different colored flare and they fire it off up there at altitude and then you rendezvous onto that group. That\u2122s your de finition, and you start from there on your mission. So, you climb to a pretty good altitude before you start to cross the Channel. And it was interesting to, before that, that the V-1s that they were firing on England, they were these kind of a putt, you hear them flapping, cause they had a \u0152 a pulse jet motor on them, and you\u2122d hear those at night. And as long as they weren\u2122t coming right over your head. Why? Because they didn\u2122t steer them, they just had an angle, wherever they go, and then they would kick the rudder over and \u0152 the horizontal stabilizers rather, and they just dive straight down. The British developed a technique to k eep those from coming into England. They had a fighter \u0152 real big fighters called nape \u0152 Typhoon, with a Napier Sabre big engine on it. Wasn\u2122t \u0152 I guess it was too heavy to be a real good fighter like the Spitfire. And they would send those out over the Channel when they hear \u0152 see these things coming in, cause they flew at a certain altitude, and the Typhoons would fly along Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 15the side of them and flap the wing on them and tip the gyro in, and they just spiral into the ocean. So the British really did a good job on downing many, many hundreds of those darn B-1s."

And then we went on to our target, it was a dru \u0152 it was an underground airbase, fighter base, and they had caves and stuff in these hills where they\u2122d put the fires inside, and everything was camouflaged, so it was a hard thing to find, but they were trying to knock out as much of those fighters as they could because of the invasion forces, you know. So we made a \u0152 went out and found the initial point, which is an identifiable point that you \u0152 they can find to turn on, and they drove cer \u0152 certain altitudes, certain speed and in a certain direction, and to the target. We met the first time and that \u0152 the bombardier couldn\u2122t fi nd the target, camouflaged. So you do a no-no, we \u0152 we made a 360 degree turn an d went back to same initial point and started the same course, same altitude, sa me everything. By that time the barrage flak that you see all the time hadn't got us the first time, so they had their tracking flak on us in. They knew our altitude, our course, they knew where we were going. So the tail gunner says, about 300 yards o ff the tail, had a burst. Next one through the waist, and the left wing wen-went off, and we caught on fire and started into a spiral. And I always figured I\u2122d ride the airplane down, get out of the crash or Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 17something. But you change yo ur mind rather quickly when that happens, so I \u0152 guys just bailing out, you know, when they gave the order to bail out.

And he pointed the guns down and the handles come up and I flipped it out and he pops out. He was a little guy, and he popped out of there so quick I couldn\u2122t believe it.

            "answer": "I didn\u2122t have too much, I guess the excitement, and all that stuff, that you don\u2122t think about it, I was just tryi ng to get out of that fiery airplane. And so we\u2122d always been told to delay your jump, cause they may \u0152 may shoot you coming down in the parachute, you know, a fighter come by, or something like that. So I had delayed my parachute til I could kind of see the leaves on the trees. And I popped the chute and it seemed like I took a couple swings and I was on the ground. And then there was a \u0152 a little boy, a lady, and a \u0152 at the end of this field where I landed in, there was a little boy over there and a lady, and so I \u0152 he ran over towards me and I reached in my kneepads to get my escape kit out and there\u2122s a little \u0152 we have books in there, a little book that says English and French, you know, cause we [indecipherable] France , and maps and stuff. And he pointed the [indecipherable] in the book, and he says hide, in there. So they took off. So I stuck my parachute under some bushes there at the edge of the field, and ran through the forest and got to the other side and I didn\u2122t know going to the other side is that I was getting deeper in the forest, but I come to a clearing. Now that little boy don\u2122t want to go out in there, cause gonna see me. So I just heard these \u0152 all these Germans running, Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 19you could hear them, and there\u2122s \u0152 their canis ter they carry with them is \u0152 their gas mask rattles like a tin can, you know, so I heard rattling, so I just dove under some bushes right there and pulled them down kind of over me and laid there, waited, and hear when the Germans come up, he\u2122s \u0152 I could reach out and grab his pant leg, he was so close, but he was l ooking way out ahead, he wasn\u2122t looking down at his feet. And I don\u2122t know, it seemed like I laid there for a day, it was probably an hour or something like that, and he kept looking out there, and I didn\u2122t breathe for a couple hours, I don\u2122t think. But anyhow, they fi nally went away and then I just walked through the forest and \u0152 and I got my maps and there \u0152 they had maps that they gave you were like a silk handkerchief, but their maps were detailed, they had the curves in the road, you could see paths in the forest, and they had \u0152 I don\u2122t know where I got them, but they were very good. So I saw a curve in the road and it\u2122s where I was at, and I located myself and then I started out to cross this one road, a divided highway. And then I heard a big rack et coming, I was right in the middle of it, it was quite wide, their divided highway wa s, and there\u2122s grass and s \u0152 lot of trees growing in the middle of it. And around th e corner I get \u0152 hear them coming. So I dove into the grass and hear a bunch of German tanks and everything else was coming by, and guys in, I don\u2122t know, lo oked like armored cars or something, I didn\u2122t \u0152 I wasn\u2122t able to really look, I wa s \u0152 buried myself in the grass, hoping they Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 20didn\u2122t see me. And they went on by, didn\u2122t see me, so I thought[indecipherable] get out of here, so I headed back. And every time I seen one walking, I would just veer off at an angle. I wouldn\u2122t walk close to them, cause they\u2122d see me, identify me. So I just kept quite a ways away, and veer off at an angle. I never made any sharp turns or quick turns or anything like that , and finally I came to this forest area, and I ran across an old deserted \u0152 I don\u2122t know was a pigpen or whatever it was, but it was pretty dilapidated. So I went in there cause it had been raining, and I got all wet and stuff like that. So I took off my coveralls, cause I had coveralls with suspenders and stuff, my flight suit. So hung up on the thing in the top of it there, and laid down on the straw, and went to bed. And then the next morning, early the next morning, I don\u2122t know, seven \u0152 six, seven o\u2122clock, or what time it was, but I heard crack \u0152 like sticks breaking, and stuff like that, and I peek out. Here is a guy out there, I thought he was an old man, it looks pre \u0152 he was probably 40 years old, cause I was only 19. And so I didn\u2122t know what to do, I had my .45 automatic, pil \u0152 you know, shoulder holster and sa \u0152 I says, I don\u2122t know whether to shoot at the guy, or make a noise in the \u0152 I had to ma ke a decision real quick here. So I thought no, I stuck the gun in the straw, and I stepped out to the door, pulled the \u0152 and peeked out to him. And he put his finger up to his mouth like be quiet. And he says [indecipherable] . I didn\u2122t know French, but I thought that meant friend or Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 21something. So he says, shh. So he left. And so about 10 - 15 minutes later, here he come back. Started motioning me to come w ith him. So I reluctantly went with him."

You know, because they don\u2122t know who you are either. Maybe an infiltrator. So I figure it\u2122s best just to not take the chance, I\u2122ll just leave the gun there.

They\u2122re going to light up a field out there, a hay field or something. And a plane was supposed to come in and pi ck us up. So they took us to another house, we stayed ther e a few days, and they \u0152 they had nothing but wine to drink. And I got so thirsty fo r some water, we went out to the \u0152 where they had a well outside there, and started pulling up the water from the well, and the French guy come out and said, no, no, no, he said \u0152 I guess he thought it was poison or something or not with \u0152 fit to drink, you know. But man, I \u0152 if you\u2122d been drinking just their white wine for a f-few days why your \u0152 get \u0152 get so thirsty for real water, you know? I did, anyway. And so anyways, a guy came by, and you probably heard the name Jacques before. He was a \u0152 I wa \u0152 I found out \u0152 we found Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 25out later he was a traitor, he was a Belgian F-French guy, and he was getting paid so much a head for all the people he turned in to the ga \u0152 the Germans. And so we got in this car, this Citro\u00ebn \u0152 oh, in the meantime, and \u0152 this house we were at, they brought another kid there, he was a \u0152 from a Wellington bomber, a British kid from a Wellington bomber. So it was Jim Fore(ph), myself and this guy from the Wellington bomber. And so they \u0152 we got in the back of this Citro\u00ebn, and the \u0152 the guy had a hat too big for him, kind of bug eyed little guy, and \u0152 and he had a redheaded woman with him, and a kid maybe 10 - 12 years old in the front seat with him. We drove into Versailles, dropped the girl \u0152 lady off and the little boy off in Versailles, and we wer \u0152 thought it was kind of strange, we went through some roadblocks just right on through, you slowed down and right on through. We thought boy, that\u2122s sort of strange. They told us it wa \u0152 he was a doctor, he could get through, you know, real ea sy cause he had the, I guess I.D. or something. But we were kind of shaken. Anyway, we went \u0152 then he left them there, we went into Paris. We ended up getting driven right into Gestapo headquarters. So, kind of surprised. So they \u0152 we went \u0152 they had the machine guns all around, and then we separated so \u0152 we walked up these stairs, second floor and down the hall, and the other Germans there, they\u2122re standing against the hall like they were afraid of us. They\u2122d stand way back [indecipherable] walking down the hall. And they Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 26separated Jim and I and I don\u2122t know where the prin \u0152 the British kid go \u0152 went either, but I know Jim and I were on the same floor up there, but he was in another room. And I went into this room, there wa s a lady and a German guy there, and he spoke English, and she was taking \u0152 writing a ll this stuff down. And so they started, you know, searching us and stuff like that. And I had my wristw atch and \u0152 and \u0152 up around my arm, up here. But they took my dog tags, I had them in my shoes and they took everything, just took everything off of us, you know, and \u0152 and put it in a si \u0152 in a \u0152 a ba \u0152 a bag there, in a big envelope. And I said, can I write my name on it or something like that? And he says no need, bury you in two days. But they didn\u2122t put my name on it. And th-the watch I had was not my military watch, it was issue watch, but \u0152 cause I had given that to the navigator cause that day he said his watch didn\u2122t work, and so I had mine and I had a gold watch that my mother had given me for graduating from school, so I wore it. But I had slipped it up here around my elbow. Anyway, took everythi ng. So, from then on, I \u0152 I don\u2122t know, they just took us back and finally after that they took us to French prison.

You could have signed your death warrant, you don\u2122t know what you\u2122re signing, you kno w, or confessions or something like that. So I just didn\u2122t sign it, and dil \u0152 I gotta say, he got a little upset over that, but \u0152 and put me in solitary and then they would come in \u0152 th-the old prison, I don\u2122t know if you know about Fr ench prison, they have the ol-old type doors. The doors are about three inches thick, I think, wooden doors, you know, and they had this little trap door up the top, over door that they could open and slide a Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 29bowl of soup in to you. And tha \u0152 and that, they had a little peephole, and they had a \u0152 one light on the side of this, in the room there, that they could turn on a switch on the outside and light the light, and in the corner you had a little carved out place there in cement, that had a little water spigot, and that was the toilet also there. And had straw on \u0152 on the fl \u0152 you know, a little place for you to sleep. Anyway, I \u0152 they\u2122d \u0152 they\u2122d come by and flip that light on and that little \u0152 you could hear them peeking \u0152 that little thing and peeking at you, you know, every once in a while. So I decided that I didn\u2122t like it. I don\u2122t know w hy I did it, but I took my little soup bowl I had, they put in there, and I propped it up on this little shelf in there so it covered their peek hole. Shouldn\u2122t have done that. Anyway, come along, pe \u0152 turned on the light, I guess, and couldn\u2122t see in. And boy, I heard the awful-est racket you ever heard out there. There\u2122s guys running, and you could hear their canisters clanging, their gas masks things and everything. Pre tty soon they opened the door, about two or three of them are there, and they come in and started knocking me all around the room, and \u0152 trying to teach me a lesson, you know. And then they left. And I was \u0152 and I spent my time picking fleas, because th ey had lice, or fleas in there, and the fleas would get in the seams of your clot hes, you know, and as a good pastime, cause they\u2122d bite you all over, and I was taking \u0152 you could feel along, little hard things and you\u2122d crunch them , you\u2122d break their shells, you know. So that was our Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 30pastime. And then we\u2122d tap on the wall, ca use there were other prisoners there. And there were some points you coul d tap and you could read the Morse code there. So you knew there were other American prison ers there or something, you know, cause they\u2122d tap back, you know. So just spent your pastime that way. Once I was \u0152"

            "answer": "Just a \u0152 trying to ask questions. They heard something like they were bombing at night, and you\u2122d hear people screaming, women and men and y ou heard noises all night long, you hear sh \u0152 gunshots, you don\u2122t know wh at was going on. And I heard later they were probably torturing people ou t there, you know, the ai \u0152 they \u0152 cause they had a lot of the French underground pe ople they\u2122d caught also. And once I was taken out to a little courtyard, you had a wa \u0152 a kind of a balcony thing up there, where the guard kept walking back and forth. And then they had this little area there, and you walk around some, I guess th at was your exercise room, you know. It was \u0152 it was penned in, but it was about prob ably 20 feet square, you could just walk around this little path around the square for exercise. And you could see carvings on the wall where people had been there from the 1800s or something like that. It\u2122s an old, old prison, but all the limestone walls, people scratched their names and stuff in it, you know, it was kind of intriguing to see all the people that had probably been there before. Cause it\u2122s an old, old prison, so \u0152 for France. And Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 31anyway, finally, when you got, I guess as \u0152 Americans were about, I don\u2122t know, who knows, 12 - 15 miles away, maybe ma \u0152 further, but there was shelling going on, you could hear it all night long, the cannons and stuff. And then it started getting pretty noisy. And so, all of a s udden the \u0152 they evacua ted us, took us out, took us all and put us in those boxcars. And they putting 90 of us in one of those boxcars, and we had to stand up. And they put a barrel in the center, cut off half a barrel and that was a toilet and everything , you know, sloshing around there. And so they \u0152 we didn\u2122t know where we were going, you know, we thought we were going to be taken out of there to a POW camp, or something, you know, but we ended up going so far and then we came to a t unnel. And apparently the Americans or someone [indecipherable] someone had bombed the tu nnel shut. And so we were in there for quite a few hours, and it got smoky and really bad. And so \u0152 then they took us all \u0152 all these boxcars and ma de us take the German, I don\u2122t know, backpacks and boxes and thin gs that we carry clothing. And we walk \u0152 followed them down a road and then across a bridge to the other side of this river, up the other side, and then we went through a little village and the \u0152 the French people were out there throwing us apples and some food and stuff like that. And the Germans were trying to keep them from it, but they\u2122d still throw the stuff, you know, and we\u2122d catch something. And then we got to a train on the other side where Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 32the tunnel had \u0152 was \u0152 was \u0152 you know, where the tunnel had been closed, we \u0152 they had backed a train up at the other side . We boarded that train and went onto \u0152 we didn\u2122t know where we\u2122re going, but I guess we got to Frankfurt , I think, Germany. But before we got there, was going up a hill or something, it\u2122s kind of slow, and the tru \u0152 the boxcar right behind us, the \u0152 th-the guys had pried a board out of the bottom of the \u0152 I found out late r, pried \u0152 and the guys were dropping out between the railroad tracks. And then, when the train was going up a hill, slowing down, why they\u2122d drop between the tracks and roll out between the wheels to get out from under there, because they had these scrapers that would go between it. So a few of the guys got out. I heard later on \u0152 I don\u2122t know this to be a fact, but I heard later on that one guy from Texas , he really escaped. He\u2122s the only guy I ever heard of ac-actually got away. So \u0152 but ki nd of a dangerous th ing to do, but you know, was trying to get out of there, and then the \u0152 the one time they \u0152 they \u0152 a French kid in our box car was hanging on one of the vents. On the opposite \u0152 cattywampus corners of the boxcar they had a vent about maybe eight or 10 inches high and about two feet long for a vent. Th ey had barbed wire strung across it. And there was this French kid, he\u2122s about 18 years old, I guess, or so \u0152 fif \u0152 14 - 15, I don\u2122t know how old he was. And he had hi s hand up on this barbed wire, holding onto it, cause we were standing up in th ere. And the German guards on the outside Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 33shot him right through the hand. And that\u2122s kind of crazy, you know, he\u2122s already in there. And anyway, then they stopped the car, they took him out. And \u0152 oh, before that, by the way, when these guys dropped out between the railroad tracks, they stopped the train, and they took about, I don\u2122t know, it must have been 10 or 15 guys out there beside the boxcar, lined them up like they were going to shoot them \u0152 cause we could look out through the cr acks and see them, and they looked like they were going to shoot them, and then this German officer was hollering at them and stuff like that. And then we were told that there \u0152 every time \u0152 if anyone tried to escape they were going to kill 15 guys for every one that tried to escape. So they were trying to quiet us down, I guess. I wasn\u2122t going anywhere. And they took this young kid out, I was surprised. And I wa s looking out a crack in that boxcar. The German officer told him to \u0152 kind of motioned him down there. The tracks were raised, kind of sloped on the side, down to \u0152 there\u2122s a f \u0152 some fields down there, have been plowed and stuff. And there\u2122s a little irrigation ditch along the edge of it. I looked down and I though t well, this German officer motioned this kid down there, I thought that he was going to have him go down, wash his hand off, cause it was bleeding and stuff like that. But as so on as he turned around, this German officer shot him right through the back. An d the kid laid down and kind of kicked like, and one of the other guards there just raked him with a machine gun. And \u0152 Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 34and then they took a couple of guys out of the boxcar and gave them shovels and made them go down there by the \u0152 right down close to that little ditch down there, and they \u0152 they weren\u2122t there very long. They dug a hole, and I don\u2122t think the thing was two feet deep. Threw this little kid in there and covered him up. And I thought, the mother will never know where that kid is.

This was my assumption, you know, cause we\u2122d always told they\u2122d take you to Dulag Luft or something, and interrog ate you and then take you to prisoner of war camp. But we were kind of shocked when we arrived there, cause Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 35we saw, you know, that sign out there on the gate says, wor-wor-work will make you free, in German, and saw the \u0152 all the dogs, and these German guards and there\u2122s skinny prisoners in there, you know, and \u0152 and all the striped clothes. And since we got in there some of the prisoners come up and pretty soon they started telling \u0152 and in English, a few of them spoke English, and \u0152 or it was relayed through some of the guys that \u0152 we ha d one guy in our group that spoke \u0152 Ben Sharf(ph) was a ger \u0152 spoke German real well. And so he said, we\u2122re in Buchenwald concentration camp.

And then they shaved every hair off of our body and then swabbed us with so mething like creosote that set us on fire, you know, and you ben \u0152 you was dancing around, jumping and si \u0152 cause it was burning, ju-just like it\u2122s peeling the skin off, you know. And then they brought us down a little fu-further and they started handing us some clothing. I was given a woman\u2122s silk blouse, and a pair of like silk slacks, or women\u2122s slacks or something, real thin things, no shoes, no socks, no nothing. Th ey took everything we had away, our other clothes, before we went in the shower. We went in the shower, we thought we were going to the gas chamber or somethin g, you know, cause we\u2122d heard stories about that stuff. But anyway, we were shocked, sort of, that \u0152 and they just finally Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 36herd us down to an area and left us ther e, we were outside on a rock pile. And I don\u2122t know, we were there I don\u2122t know how many days.

            "answer": "Yeah, out-outside, and a \u0152 kind of a rock pile area there. And then we \u0152 one day we saw \u0152 we heard this noise, we look up in the air and hear a \u0152 about 30,000 feet or so up there was a whole bunch of bombers coming over, you know, you could see the contrails behind them. And they we re \u0152 looked like they were coming right at us. We said, holy mackerel, you know, I hope they\u2122re not going to drop those things on us. And all of a sudden they popp ed a flair, like a lead bombardier always pops a flair and they s \u0152 the group tightens their formation, and they make a nice pattern. So we thought, holy mackerel, he re they come. And all of a sudden you heard this ru \u0152 it\u2122s \u0152 if you ever heard bombs coming down, they fi \u0152 sound like a freight train coming down the track, and there\u2122s a little whistle going on to them, and they\u2122re just shredder and rattling like a freight train coming in, you know. And all of a sudden \u0152 and they started landing below, and we thought, boy, they\u2122re going to get us here. But not one bomb lit inside th e \u0152 the fence. They blew part of the \u0152 the fence down, but they were bombing the underground fa ctory that \u0152 where all the Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 37wor \u0152 the slave labor was used. And that was a V-2, V-2, gyros and factories for ammunition and stuff like that there. So we were relieved and \u0152 you know, they didn\u2122t drop it on us. But they \u0152 a pparently they went down the SS barracks, took out about 2,000 SS guys and \u0152 and gutted the whole place with \u0152 they first went in with explosives and then they dr opped incendiaries after that. Then they dropped leaflets. I saw one of the leaflets, but they started shooting at people that picked up the leaflets, so there were \u0152 but there were still a few prisoners got ahold of leaflets. I saw one of them later. It showed a picture of a B-17 and a silhouette of a B-29, showed how much bigger the B-29 was and that we warned the Germans that they were going to start using these planes on th em if they don\u2122t surrender, and stuff like that, you know, and \u0152 and it showed how Am ericans treat German prisoners of war, and stuff, it showed them in mess halls and stuff like that. And they \u0152 and then had a thing and they were trying to invite the pr \u0152 us prisoners to join them and fight against the Russians. And they give us extr a benefits or something.

We already had agreed to this before, we were going to say they were all students.

So we \u0152 none of us worked, we all refused to work. So \u0152 I don\u2122t know if that was a good idea or not, but we weren\u2122t \u0152 didn\u2122t seem be punished any more for it, you know. And they finally \u0152 we were living outside, like I say, on the rocks out there. And one day \u0152 and there were a lot of these little Gypsy kids, you\u2122ve heard about them probably. I don\u2122t know how many, there were hundreds of them around there. And you had to watch, because if you had any food left at all, you have some, once in a while, about once a week, you get about three little \u0152 real small, little baked potatoes, half rotten, but they\u2122d been boiled, you know. It was bette r than nothing. And if one of \u0152 if you had piece of those left, they\u2122d steal it, those poor little Gypsy kids that were running around, they were hungry, you know, and they steal anything that wasn\u2122t tied down. And they were in a barracks there, and one day, it seemed like to me, they all disappeared. And they come down and got us and gave us that barracks. And I used to think, oh my, what\u2122d they do, did they kill them all? They [indecipherable] their camp, what happened to them? I still to this day don\u2122t know really what all happened to those poor little kids. But they were little \u0152 you know, from Latvia, Lithuania , Estonia, all the eastern countries that they picked them up, th eir parents were probably killed, and they brought them in there. But that was \u0152 that\u2122s been kind of a Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 39disturbing thing all my life, the \u0152 what happened to those poor little kids, you know. But we wer \u0152 we got the barracks and \u0152 and we were fortunate to get those, you know, and then we were there I don\u2122t know how long and we got a bowl of grass soup every day, you know, and three \u0152 we got about three little potatoes once a week or so, and \u0152 and then they brought in some \u0152 a barrel one time of la \u0152 like little sardines, they were just in saltwater, they were raw things, you know, dead, but \u0152 and were in saltwater, real heavy brine saltwater. And of course we ate those things like crazy. And w-we associated with all the other prisoners. There was a \u0152 right near \u0152 across from our barracks was a Polish barracks, and one day there was a big scuffle over there, you saw a whole bunch of them piling on some guy, and you wonder what happened. Well, later on I fo u \u0152 h-heard that this one Polish guy had been at another camp, and apparently he had been a snitch or something like that. And I don\u2122t know if it was a fake, or what, but they said he knocked a bowl of soup out of one of the guy\u2122s hands. So a bunch of them jumped on him and put a blanket over his head and slugged him to death. It was just, you know, dog eat dog type attitude. And then they had these guys, you maybe heard of kapos , they were called kapos . These were German prisoners, but they had given them special rations to be \u0152 and they were all big guys, and they\u2122d give them a big board or a club, like a baseball bat, and they were to keep us ot her prisoners in line, to obey orders you Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 40know. Line up, do this, to go here. So ev erybody tried to stay away from those kapos . And so \u0152 but I used to talk to so me of the Polish g uys over there spoke English, and you \u0152 I don\u2122t know if you\u2122ve ever heard of the esso \u0152 SOE guys, they were British and \u0152 and some of them were Scottish, most of them British. But they were secret type guys, operations guys that were dropped behind the German lines to do sabotage and stuff. And they were about \u0152 oh, there must have been 30 or so of them in there, 35 or 40. And one day they took \u0152 took \u0152 I heard \u0152 I don\u2122t know how many, but th \u0152 17 of them went into Weimar , and I guess were tried, they brought them back and killed them. And later on they killed all the other guys. But I used to talk to some of those guys, and I found out two of them were from Scotland, they were twins, and one had had a sc ar up in his shoulder, and they put a scar on the other one\u2122s shoulder just like it. And they had \u0152 one would be up in Bremen, up in northern Germany, another would be down in Munich and something would happen, a bi g explosion or something wo uld happen, they\u2122d catch this guy and \u0152 cause he was there, and he had the evidence, because you know, he\u2122d be \u0152 be real obvious around someplace, and he said no, I was, you know, here. I wasn\u2122t there. And here that they \u0152 they finally coupled the fact together that this \u0152 they were twins, and the Germans finally caught them both. And later on they were both killed. They killed all those SOE guys, the British guys. And the Russian guys Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 41\u0152 I used to talk to some of the Russians, they\u2122d speak a little bit of English, and one of them used to tell me all the time that America would never survive because we produced so many airplanes and stuff lik e that, and we would financially and everything, fold after the war, that we couldn\u2122t stand all that production, and stuff like that. A few little conversations like that we had with the Russians, you know, that did speak some English. And they \u0152 I don\u2122t know if you\u2122ve ever seen the [indecipherable] but I didn\u2122t know til after the war that they had a building up there, the Russians, a lot of them disappeared. They would take them up there and there was a like a \u0152 a medical examination. They\u2122d stand them on some scales, and they had a hole right behind the scales, there in the wall, and a gun back there, and they\u2122d turn around like that, and shoot them right through the back of the head. And they eliminated a whole bunch of Russians that way by \u0152 by make \u0152 make them think they were giving them a medical, they were standing on the scale, then bam, they\u2122re gone. And the crematorium there was \u0152 I\u2122ve been there a few times after the war, after I been out of there, and they still have the hooks on the wall where they used to hang the prisoners, and they would cut them, their legs and bodies, and bleed \u0152 let the blood drain out of them into the drain, because then they would burn them in the crematorium upstairs, and they had these little trollies that they\u2122d lay them on and wheel them up there, and then wheel them into these chambers up Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 42there, had about, I don\u2122t know, eight or 10 of these cremation chambers up there, wheel them in there and cremate them. Cause they had bodies stacked by the crematorium all day long. The \u0152 used to se e so much inhumanity to man, that you couldn\u2122t understand. You\u2122re already a pris oner, and you\u2122d be sta \u0152 we\u2122d stand up there \u0152 we counted \u0152 they called it appel. My number was 78,336, but \u0152 and we weren\u2122t tattooed, and we used to ask the kapos , the fa \u0152 the kapos told us that we were not tattooed because we were trading material. I guess \u0152 we \u0152 we assumed that that was going to be trading for German prisoners, you know, that we\u2122re \u0152 we captured or something. We didn\u2122t \u0152 and kno w \u0152 don\u2122t really know to this day what it was all about, why we weren\u2122t tattooed. But there were about \u0152 later on I found there were about, probably about 50,000 prisoners there, you know [indecipherable] 78,000, but they were dying off so fast, and I later fi \u0152 learned after the war that \u0152 from the archives at Buchenwald that the diet was designed to starve you to death in about three months . Keep cycling prisoners through there, cause they needed ru \u0152 labor, slave labor to work in the pri \u0152 in the factories and stuff, you know? So that was one way of just getting rid of them, starve them to death, rather than shoot them, or some go to \u0152 took energy and took people. I\u2122ve heard all sorts of rumors, I don\u2122t know why, but I don\u2122t know. I\u2122ve heard that the \u0152 they used to lie in the \u0152 you\u2122ve seen where the pictures of the Jewish people lined Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 43up by ga \u0152 by these pits and they\u2122d shoot th em and drop in the pits and they\u2122d cover them up. But the people that had to mow them down, those people had mental problems because they didn\u2122t \u0152 you know, they were killing other humans. So that\u2122s why the gas chambers came into being, so much. That was to \u0152 cause it wasn\u2122t such a personal thing. So \u0152 but it\u2122s [indecipherable] because when we stand up for appel to be counted, these SS guys would stand up there, they count your heads, and they had to have the count right in ca mp before they would excuse you, go back to the barracks, or where you\u2122re gonna go. Sometimes it\u2122d take three hours, and it \u0152 guys \u0152 some of the guys were \u0152 I weighed 82 pounds when I got out of there, ssome of the guys were skinnier than I was, couldn\u2122t stand up. And you\u2122d try to help them stand up, and the SS guys would wade in there a nd knock his brains out with a rifle butt, and make the prisoners put him on a gunny sack, four of them carry him over and stack him by the bodies by the crem atorium now. So it\u2122s just \u0152 and there was these two wheel carts running around all day, picking up bodies and hauling them to the crematorium. So it was just not a very good environment. And you just wonder \u0152 I used to wonder about how can people be so cruel, and just \u0152 you\u2122re already prisoners, you know, why make it even worse? But we had a guy whose name the ger \u0152 the German SS guy up there was named Hauptman . And he would stand up there when we were out there, and ge \u0152 weather got ki nd of cool, and he Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 44had a little bucket, and he had a little cup in it, and he\u2122d say \u0152 he\u2122d pull back his uniform, show he had woolen underwear u nderneath. And he\u2122d say, cold, cold? And then he\u2122d throw \u0152 take a s-scoop up a bucket of this water \u0152 a scoop of this water and throw it out over us, you know, like sp ray us, you know, with a little bit of water. He\u2122d say cold? He just kind of tormented, you know. I don\u2122t know what he did it for, but it \u0152 how \u0152 I don\u2122t know how people get some enjoyment out of that. Anyway, that was my feeling. And one day the Americans came over and bombed the \u0152 when we were outside, I was telling you before, living outside on the rocks were \u0152 after that bombing, why, we were asked, will you come down and guide us? They said, if you were soldiers, you have the discipline to help us with the wounded. And they had a guy in there, I don\u2122t know h \u0152 the \u0152 he spoke a British accent, like he was \u0152 be-been trained in England or something, and he would talk to us, you know, he was the guy that they used for communication to us. And then the \u0152 they had another guy in there named \u0152 he was a Dutchman from du \u0152 Holland, he spoke good English and he spoke German also. So they\u2122d communicate through him, and he gave us lots of information. But anyway, they come down and got us, they says, you will help us with the wounded people in the bombing. Took us up there, and I didn\u2122t help anybody, cause I had no shoes, I was running through this fire and nails and stuff out there, and wood and stuff, and I was Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 45going as slow as I could. And I saw a wooden \u0152 wooden shoe laying over there, and so I kneeled down and put that wooden shoe on my left foot, and the German guards over there picked up some board and started beating me across the back, and you know, knocked the wind out of me. It seemed like I climbed \u0152 I crawled about a mile, probably about 20 feet, but it seemed like a mile, and just got \u0152 almost knocked me out, cause I couldn\u2122t hardly breathe, you know, knocked the wind out of me. And I didn\u2122t help anybody. I just act like I was help \u0152 trying to help some, put out the fire, something lik e that. I just went around, but I didn\u2122t do a darn thing, but no one bothered me after that. Finally, I went back to my building I was in, but I sure didn\u2122t help anybody. Some of the guys, I guess, had to help somebody, you know, I didn\u2122t. But anyway, when the Luft waffe guy came through to look \u0152 he\u2122s \u0152 I guess he was going to say, look at the bomb damage, he told the \u0152 the other SS guys that. And he came in. Well, we had a guy, Ben Sharf (ph) from New Prague, Minnesota , he was our waist gunner. He spoke German from his ancestor was German. And so we said, Ben, you gotta go up, talk to the guy. Tell him we should be in a POW camp. So Jim Fore (ph) and I went up with him, close to him, and he s \u0152 we told him salute the guy, so he\u2122s \u0152 Ben saluted him, and this German off \u0152 Luftwaffe officer, he kind of gives a real, slow salute. He didn\u2122t know what to do, I think, cause real slow he kind of went like this, real slow, put his hand down. And Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 46they talked a few minutes, and then the SS tried to break it up, and he pulled his rank on them and told them to stand back, and so he talked about five minutes to Ben, and he told Ben that they didn\u2122t work very good with the Gestapo and the SS, but he\u2122d do what he could, but we should be in a POW camp, he agreed. And we thought, well, that\u2122s encour aging news, but \u0152 and he le ft. And it was, I don\u2122t know, a month later, when I hear about a contingent of about 150 Luftwaffe people came into camp, round us up, took us and put into only about 30 - 40 in a boxcar and took us to Stalag Luft III over \u0152 over \u0152 over on the Polish border. So, man, and we got food, we got shoes, we got clothes. It was \u0152 it was like being in the Waldorf Astoria, you know. But it was really \u0152 really grateful th-that he came about. Now, I just found out recently that there\u2122s a book called, \ufb01A Higher Call.\ufb02 And I had heard about a B-17 that had been shot down, riddled pretty badly, and it was down, oh 3,000 feet or so, and they\u2122d been throwing the radios out and the \u0152 the parachutes and everything to lighten plane, they\u2122d get back to England . Well, this \u0152 this German fighter flew right down beside him, wingtip to wingtip, and tried to motion, and \u0152 they \u0152 they couldn\u2122t communicate, but th-the pilot was Brown, Lieutenant Brown flying that B-17, trying to get back to England, and this German fighter pilot was trying to make a motion for him to go to England \u0152 I mean, go to fr \u0152 to Sweden, closer, across the Channel . And this book is called, \ufb01A Higher Call.\ufb02 Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 47Now, this German fighter pilot was a Catholic guy, and he had even some other fighter pilots with him, had gone to Goering and tried to resign and knock off some of the stuff they was doing, but they almost got shot over it. And this book is called, \ufb01A Higher Call,\ufb02 and it\u2122s just recently come out. It\u2122s in English. I got a copy of it just this \u0152 this last month. It\u2122s quite intriguing to read, but this guy is the same guy that came into our camp, that got us out of there, and he got us out of there three days before the record \u0152 the record showing Buchenwald whatever, that we \u0152 we were supposed to be eliminated three days \u0152 and he got us out three days before we were supposed to all been killed. The orders had come down from Berlin. And this was just recently because this guy, Mike Dorsey, his father \u0152 his grandfather was in Buchenwald with us, his name was Easy(ph) Freeman(ph). And his grandfather started talking about it in recent years, I guess, and so Mike Dorsey was a movie producer, he decided to look into it, and he went back to Germany for almost a year research, and then went to all the archives in Buchenwald and everything. And he made this movie called, \ufb01 The Lost Airman of Buchenwald ,\ufb02 cause we had been lost because they didn\u2122t know where we were. We weren\u2122t in a POW camp until after the war they found where we were. So, that\u2122s the reason that movie is named that, but I\u2122m glad that he \u0152 his gr andfather finally started talking about it, and he made this movie, and \u0152 and he \u0152 he even got \u0152 I was surprised, but when he Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 48went back to Buchenwald , looked at all the records, he brought me back my arrest record, my Gestapo arrest picture, and the record of it. Shows USA, and then has it crossed out, and I think it says [indecipherable] or something up there on it."

We saw one guy, and he went running, cli \u0152 tried to climb the electric fence, you know, some guys gave up. I have a \u0152 a strange attitude of life.

And when I used to work in the engineering stuff, why we\u2122d be on government proposals. We had three guys in my depart ment die of heart attacks in one year, and they issued stress cards that you hold and they turn color if you start getting stressed, and the director\u2122d hold a meeting, and pretty soon you seen him take his little card out of his pocket, lay it down on the table, and I knew he was getting stressed. And after the meeting, guys used to come up to me , cause they\u2122d be hollering, deadlines and why don\u2122t you do this, why don \u2122t you do that. And they\u2122d come up to me and say, let\u2122s see your card. Show them mine, it wa s normal. They\u2122d say, what the hell is wrong with you, don\u2122t you have any nerves? I said yeah .

And when I was in Buchenwald it turned into gangrene, like. It was all numb and just \u0152 couldn\u2122t have any feeling, it felt like just you \u0152 you know how your leg \u0152 how someth ing goes to sleep when you\u2122re [indecipherable] that\u2122s the way it felt. I could hardly feel I was walking on it, you know, it was just kind of bad. So when I got to Stalag Luft III, why, they \u0152 they tried to put sulfur drugs and stuff on it and nothing would touch it, so then they put me in the prison hospital. And the German doctor there wanted to amputate my Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 54leg right above the knee. And I \u0152 Captain Daniels, he was \u0152 we had Major jone \u0152 Davy Jones, and Captain Daniels, who were on the Doolittle raids in Tokyo unit. And they ended up in Europe and being shot down, and they were in our \u0152 south compound of the da \u0152 Stalag Luft III . Anyway, Captain Daniels there in the hospital and I said, no, no, no, I \u0152 you know, listen, I don\u2122t want my leg cut off. And so they talked to the German guy, Captain Daniels , and they decided, well, the only solution was to try to save would be to \u0152 they made kind of a tray, a curved tray they laid down on my leg, and they wrap ped my leg with gauze about \u0152 looked like about two inches thick, and they hung it up at about a 20 - 30 degree angle, and they put a \u0152 a \u0152 a metal bucket up there, hung it up there with a nail hole in it, dripping saltwater on it. And they dripped it on my toe, and it just run down the thing. I don\u2122t know if it was a month or something, it dri pped \u0152 just dripped every day, it was just \u0152 it was miserable, just laying there, but you know \u0152 anyway it was a long time, I don\u2122t know how long it was, but that thing got \u0152 the whole thing got just like a big rock cast, cause all that salt and then it\u2122d evaporate, you know. And they come in one day and they said, well, we\u2122re gonna cut it off, see what we got. So they cut that \u0152 all that gauze and stuff off of there, and it was just a \u0152 if you\u2122ve ever seen a parched earth, it\u2122s just cracks and stuff and brown, and rotten looking thing. And then they squeezed it with this gauze and stuff, and the pus is squirt out around my Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 55ankle, and it volcanoes up around my knee an d stuff like that, and they\u2122d squeeze it and milk it a little bit. And it stunk like crazy. So he looked at it, and they sh \u0152 they kind of shook their heads, and they sa id, well, it\u2122s doing something, so they wrapped it up again, put the saltwater up there again and kept dripping it on there, and I don\u2122t know, seemed like a month, I don\u2122t know how long it was, really. And it got all hard again, they took it off, and it was starting to grow skin back. So they kept wrap \u0152 wrapping in gauze, and stuff like that, and they we \u0152 and they finally sent me back to the \u0152 my barracks back at the saw \u0152 compound, and I was there and I was \u0152 it was hard to walk on, but it was \u0152 I was limping around, and it was getting a little better all the time. And they would \u0152 I \u0152 I forget how often the \u0152 but they would rewrap it. I don\u2122t remember, my mi nd is gone, I guess, on how often, but every once in a while they\u2122d \u0152 every couple of days, why they\u2122d rewrap the leg, and I\u2122d walk on it. It hurt, but I walked on it, and then I was in \u0152 I was \u0152 guess I was in the theater one night there when all of a sudden they come in and said, we\u2122re \u0152 we\u2122re gonna leave the camp. Cause we\u2122d seen all the low flying airplanes and stuff going, you know, to-towards th e Russian front over there, and we\u2122d heard a lot of rumors about it in camps, what\u2122s going on. And so Colonel Clark , he was a colonel major \u0152 he was General Clark at Colorado Springs there, the air \u0152 air academy there later on, but he was a colonel in our camp there at south compound. Major Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 56Davy Jones and Captain Daniels and Colonel Clark. Anyway, Colonel Clark asked me, he says, that we\u2122re gonna go on this march [indecipherable] we\u2122re gonna leave. There\u2122s about three foot of snow on the ground, and Colonel Cl \u0152 Colonel Clark asked me, he says, you want to stay here, and be liber \u0152 or be \u0152 we \u0152 get liberated by the Russians? Or do y ou want to go with the masses, it\u2122s your choice. So I says, I\u2122ll go with the masses of people, and maybe the cold and the walking, the circulation will help. He says , you think you can make it? I says, well, I\u2122m gonna try. So I went on the march, I was limping and it hurt, but every day seemed to be a little bit better, cause I thi nk the circulation and the cold \u0152 it wasn\u2122t gonna re-infect, I don\u2122t think, with the cold, you know. And I think the circulation was helped by just walking on it, just constantly walking, cause we walked a long time. And finally got better. I was still limping when I got home, but \u0152"

We just a ssumed that we were hostages to be held, and the more of us that they could keep, the \u0152 the better. And getting us away from the fronts, you know, and we ended up down at Moosburg , which was pretty crowded, had lots of prisoners there, you know. And then we heard rumors about the allies not too far away, and they \u0152 th ey had radio there too, you know, their secret radios, they had crystal sets. And I heard \u0152 we were told that \u0152 that if they tried to evacuate us from Moosburg to be \u0152 light a building on fire or something, cause they\u2122d have planes circling. And we noticed that at about 35,000 feet or something, way up in the sky, we\u2122d hear these airplanes, and once in a great while you could see one of them, but they\u2122re \u0152 just barely see them. And they were \u0152 Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 58circled day and night, and they said, light a building on fire, something, if anything \u0152 they started to kill anybody or anything like that, and they would make an immediate attack on the camp. And we were shocked one day was \u0152 I was down by the gate cause there was a lot of commotion and stuff and the Germans were coming by, and there are tanks rolling by a nd everything else, and I think Captain he \u0152 and Captain Daniels was down there close to me too, and the German guards all of a sudden were running to a \u0152 one the buildings, their \u0152 their little guard shack there. And \u0152 and then we saw what was happening, the SS guy there, there was tank people out there, were telling the \u0152 motioning them to come out and help fight, I guess, cause we were right down there by the gate watching them, and all of a sudden one of these Germans put a Panzer fist, a German anti-tank gun right into those \u0152 his own guys, those Luftwaffe guys at the \u0152 at the gate in the building there, just blew it wide open. Holy mackerel, you know, what\u2122s going on, cause all hell was breaking loose, you know. You hear gu nfire and cannon fire and everything else, and the Americans were shelling pretty high with large cannons, because you could look up to Moosburg and see the tar sliding off the roofs of the houses and stuff. So, was pretty noisy for a while, and all of a sudden the American tanks started coming by and we sa w the goings on, and \u0152 and it wasn\u2122t five minutes behind the front lines, here come Patton , riding in a Jeep . It\u2122s ju \u0152 standing up in Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 59his Jeep, and he motioned they \u0152 he motioned a tank or something, break down the fence, he come driving right inside the camp and stood up in his Jeep, and told everybody, you know, to be quiet or something. He gave a little talk and told us not to go into town, and stuff like that. And I was shocked to see him there, I was \u0152 you know, just dumbfounded. Here he had hi s pearl handled revolvers on, that you know, like, what was it \u0152 what\u2122s her name , some, you know, singer had given him, you know. And I-I was shocked, cause he wasn\u2122t five minutes for find the \u0152 behind the front lines. So we just stayed in camp and then they let us out, and I went up to where the Americans had put a pontoon bridge across the river up there, right in town, in the south side of town. And I went up there one time, and the \u0152 the \u0152 I was amazed that the engineers were out there putting a bridge back across the river; it had been cut loose. They were trying to get tanks across the river, and the Germans were up higher, shelling that down there to the river, and they cut the bri \u0152 their pontoon bridge loose one time, and it floate d kind of down the river, and they had these little boats out there, outboard [indecipherable] towing that thing back up and con \u0152 reconnected. And shells were, you know, dropping in the water down in \u0152 above them there. I was shocked, I \u0152 no w I realized, you know, I\u2122d be running and hiding, rather than being there, but you could see it, the splash of the water and stuff, from where we were. And I remember seeing that \u0152 that German flag come Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 60off that steeple up there in Moosburg , and the American flag go up. What a \u0152 what a feeling. You can\u2122t explain it. It\u2122s just \u0152"

And seeing the family, and then the \u0152 I stayed in the \u0152 I wasn\u2122t \u0152 I wasn\u2122t discharged yet, but I was able to stay home, and I worked with GCA \u0152 Ground Approach Systems , cause Gilfillan was building radars and stuff for ground approaches, training, and I was Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 63still in the military, so I went to Mines Field which is LA International Airport, but the military side of it, and I \u0152 we\u2122d go there every day and worked to put radios in planes and tune them up and stuff like that, cause the pilots were practicing landing with that new radar Gilfillan built. So I worked there for, I don\u2122t know, a couple of months. At first I was assigned \u0152 I ga \u0152 got to go home, a nd then I was at \u0152 at \u0152 got to what was it, Santa Monica, at a hotel out there, and then \u0152 but I wasn\u2122t required to stay there, I had a home tel \u0152 hotel room, but they said I could live at home if I wanted to, so I just lived at home with my parents. And I\u2122d drive out to ma-march \u0152 Mines Field every day at LA International Airport, and so I don\u2122t know how long I worked there until I got out of the service, and sent to San Bernardino , and I was discharged from there. But in the meantime I\u2122d read in the paper and the magazines about television and some stuff, and Dr. se \u0152 de \u0152 Lee De Forest, who invented the vacuum tube and Sanabria , his cohort had formed an engineering, electrical engineering and TV school in \u0152 on \u0152 in Hollywood . And so I got ahold of them and wanted to know if I could go to school there and get a degree in electrical engineering and learn TV and stuff like that, and so I signed up for it. So I went to s \u0152 I was in school three days after I got discharged out of San Bernardino. So I went right to school, and got out of there \u0152 went there f \u0152 about three years and got out, and the first thing I did was \u0152 cause TV was just coming on the market, I went Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 64in the TV business. I went to work for a guy that was \u0152 bought a TV, and then went in it myself. And RCA was advertising they were gonna make a \u0152 a projection tube, five inch projection tube. And they\u2122d had a little 10 inch table model TV. And Bausch and Lomb was talking about a lens for this RCA thing. So I was inquisitive, I called them up and asked RCA if I could get is \u0152 one of those tubes, and called Bausch and Lomb , see if I could get a lens, and I did it, and I took a 10 inch RCA TV and converted it to \u0152 made a little projection set. I put a 12 by 16 foot projection set in the Shrine Auditorium in 1947 for the Rose Bowl game and the Rose Parade. I sold 200 and \u0152 I sold 2400 s \u0152 I think \u0152 no, s \u0152 fe \u0152 was it \u0152 about a thousand seats anyway, at two dollars and 40 cents apiece for the whole Rose Bowl game and the Rose Parade . I \u0152 I \u0152 I was sweating that, because I had two of these little TV projector things made up, and with a RCA chassis because if one failed, I thought I\u2122d re \u0152 I\u2122d get shot if something happened. But I went to Bodie(ph) plastic screens, I could contact a guy in Hollywood that \u0152 cause I knew they made \u0152 you know, they had their experimental TVs and ther \u0152 not TVs, but projections up there. They already project them from the rear. So I got ahold of this Bodie(ph) plastic screen guy out in \u0152 in Venice, made the screens, and asked him if he can make me a screen. So I had a 12 by 16 foot, they made a wooden frame and put this plastic on it, and they s \u0152 they\u2122d put the projector back there and ha-have a hot spot, and Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 65they\u2122d spray with a \u0152 like a spray gun with plastic, and it would make it thicker in the center, so it made it even, the light even. Wouldn\u2122t have a hot spot in the center. So I parj \u0152 project it from the rear, and had a good time. I didn\u2122t have any complaints at all, and all these people over there got to see the Rose Bowl game. I made money and \u0152"

It\u2122s going to be used by historians and Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 68scholars of the Holocaust for many, many years to come. Is there anything you\u2122d like to say in closing?",
            "answer": "The only thing I\u2122d like to say is, I\u2122ve been very interested in the school system for a long time, cause I have had a couple of kids go through it. My wife and I were both involved heavily in the \u0152 going to school board meetings and stuff, and I was astonished at all \u0152 how little history and real information is being given and the \u0152 the \u0152 I don\u2122t think the teaching professions care much about this type of thing. And I\u2122ve always felt, and I\u2122ve heard many year s that those who forget history are deemed to relive it. And it scares me that the young people today know very little about that stuff. And it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s maybe it\u2122s \u0152 a lot of it\u2122s kind of nasty, but I-I just think that \u0152 that the school systems and the colleges even are \u0152 I\u2122ve talked to a lot of college professors and stuff. Like, my older son used to come home and tell me what the college professors are saying. An d it just disturbed me that they are not more knowledgeable. They should be, I thin k. And I just \u0152 that\u2122s part \u0152 it just bothers me that they\u2122re not educating the ki ds to really \u0152 what really went on in history, cause they don\u2122t even teach, I don\u2122t think, good old-time history, how this country was founded, you kn ow. Our freedoms that we have. If you go to \u0152 if you\u2122ve traveled much, and a lot of people haven\u2122t \u0152 I have, quite a bit in other countries, and see how they operate and what\u2122s going on, and this is still the Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 69greatest country there is, and the freedoms we have. But they seem to be gradually taken away from us, and the \u0152 things no w are happening today that disturb me greatly, because it\u2122s just that little encroachment upon these little liberties and little things, they\u2122re just going away, and th \u0152 thou gh that\u2122s not right, you know, this, that and the other thing. But this country didn\u2122t grow, it didn\u2122t grow financially \u0152 it\u2122s been the most successful country in the world. And why people can\u2122t see that \u0152 to me it\u2122s obvious. And why do people from al l over the world want to come to the United States? And that bothers me a great deal , that we don\u2122t \u0152 I don\u2122t know, it just \u0152 I\u2122m just disturbed by the way our count ry seems to be going, and that fact that young people don\u2122t really know anything abou t history. That part bothers me. My grandkids, I\u2122m glad to say that I \u0152 I was able last year in April to \u0152 when I went to Buchenwald , and \u0152 by invitation of the Germans; my wife and I; my younger son and my grandkids; we took them, we went there, they were \u0152 spent a week at Buchenwald area, hearing all the speeches and seeing the graves and seeing all the history that took place there. And they were \u0152 my dau \u0152 granddaughter is fif \u0152 just turned 15, she\u2122s old enough to understand, she asked a lot of questions, so she was inquisitive. I just think more kids need to know about what really went on. I know that some of it is nasty and bad, but th at\u2122s life. And protecting them and saying everything\u2122s just hunky dory and sm-smile y roses all the time is not the way real Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 70life is. So that part bothers me, I just \u0152 I-I just have strong feelings about our school system and things like that, I \u0152 I\u2122m bothered enough [indecipherable]. But it does, it bothers me a great deal that even grown-up people don\u2122t know. And [indecipherable] today, a lot of people still deny the Holocaust happened. How can they deny it with so much evidence and \u0152 and everything? And yet people, th-they seem to have their head in the sand, to me. And maybe I\u2122m just an old \u0152 ignorant old man, but I-I feel that people need to o-open their eyes and look around, cause we sure don\u2122t want to relive it. Anyway, th at\u2122s my feelings, I just \u0152 you\u2122re stuck with them."
