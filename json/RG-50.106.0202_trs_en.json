So actually when I spent my time in United States all these ten years, I met this guy very often and we met even several times a year. Even when we were I was in, actually in Ohio and he was in California. So we met at least twice or three times a year and spent very much free times together. And this family is a Jewish family. He married then a woman from Prague. She is Jewish and he adopted actually her five children. And even with this family I was very close to this family and spent a lot time with this family."
