            "answer": "I was born Renate Laqueur and I was born on November 3, 1919, in Brieg, Germany. Today that part of Germany is Poland, because it\u2019s Silesia and it\u2019s near Breslau. I was shipped from Germany three weeks old to Holland because my father emigrated to Holland in 1919. So, this is why I'm more Dutch than German."

            "question": "Can you tell me about your early childhood and about your family?",
            "answer": "My early childhood, let\u2019s say, was of course in Holland. I grew up in Holland, went to school in Holland. My father and mother were both German and had their parents still in Germany. We used to visit my grandmother in the summers because my grandmother's home in Brieg was a jewel of a house. It was a big house with a beautiful garden and a tennis court and a swimming pool and in...in the twenties my mother's father was a...what do you call it? He was making paper stuff, let\u2019s say, like folders and writing. There's a word for it, I forget what it is. Anyway, he made his money in this factory, or firm, in Brieg and she had the money. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection My father was an intellectual. He had studied medicine and was mainly interested at that point in medicine and pharmacology. He never practiced medicine but was a Pharmacologist Endocrinologist and the interesting thing about this is that in the early twenties he starts in Holland to work for slaughter houses because he wants the hormonal products of horses and cows because they begin the first hormone preparation in his laboratory in Amsterdam. He was first in Amsterdam and ended up as the Dean of the University in Amsterdam in the thirties and forties. Anyway, he... In his laboratory they discovered testosterone. So, he is one of the first hormone researchers and I grew up when you asked me about childhood, that my father would put Ponds Cold Cream on one cheek and another hormone cream on the other cheek to see which one worked better. I think it was the Ponds. O.K. Early childhood, what more do you want to know?"

            "answer": "Lousy taste because she wouldn't throw out a thing and she would buy crap because she was stingy. So, we didn't grow up in a house full of beautiful objects. We grew up with whatever was available. Never had a decent new bought dress in my youth because that's the way they were brought up. You get hand me downs. We were five children. There was an older sister https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and older brother. Me and my younger sister, so five. I think one of the reasons why I got very orderly and very much into beautiful things, whatever, was a reaction to this kind of wild household. But intellectually I think I owe both my parents the interest in literature, art, medicine, anything. Anything except politics. Politics did not play a role. Religion was a very strange situation because my father and mother were both Jewish racially,but had never, ever been in a synagogue. Even in Germany, so my father was born 1880. My mother was born 1883. I've personally never been in a synagogue except when I travel and if I'm in a group or if I'm in Turkey then the guide goes and shows me a synagogue."

            "question": "Were you conscious of the background of being Jewish?",
            "answer": "I was conscious of this background and made more conscious of it by a sheer fluke. The schools in Holland are not like here, private or public. Every school was public. You went to public kindergarten, public lower grade, middle school, whatever and then high school is Gymnasium. To go into a university you had to go at that time into a certain school which prepared you for the university. If you went into a trade, there was another school. But if you had...If you didn't want to go to university, I couldn't make it to the university school, I was too stupid. I jumped from what they call a girl's school into the second class of the Gymnasium. I wasn't all that stupid I was just in protest. What made me very interested in https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection religion, I was 11 or 12 and I had to go, let's say, into the school where you either go to university to stay in a trade school or you could get a girl's education. At that time it was just nothing. And, I was a biker. Like all Dutch kids, you were born on a bike and I biked and I was careless. And they wanted to put me in a certain school which was right around the neighborhood because then I wouldn't bike so far and come home with a broken leg or whatever. I got put into that school. It was a so called Hervormd Lyceum which is not only Lutheran but it is the Reformed Lutheran church, so the most Calvinistic sect of the Lutheran church you can be in. That was my school, because it was in the neighborhood. Then the school moved out of the neighborhood and I was in the school anyway, but there comes my religion. My religious background was Sunday school, Christian. It was prayer every morning and so and so on. And it had some Jewish children. I wonder whether they were there because it was the neighborhood. I think they were there because it was a very good school. And so, this is where the Christian background comes from. The other thing, there is a habit in my family which is very German that came Christmas around, number one we had a tree. Number two the kids were supposed to recite the Christmas story under the Christmas tree. The oldest kid first and by the time it reached me and my sister, it must have been close to the middle 30s, Hitler was there already because I was born in '19. So this was the Christian background. Jews were never mentioned except after '33. '33 the first immigrants came from Germany fleeing Hitler and my father immediately got into committees, helped and was on refugees committees. We had refugees all over the place, and we were aware of it, how lucky we were that we did not grow up in Germany but in Holland. I had also problems in school because they knew https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection that my parents were Germans and the Dutch kids hated Germans. They had nicknames for them like in France the Bosches and we called them the Moffen. I was always the child of a moff father, which was a German father. The problem was that he was a professor, that he lectured at the University and that he was so ungifted with language that he never learned decent Dutch so that the students finally said, \u201cProfessor Laqueur do us a favor, talk in German because we can't understand you.\u201d So, he lectured in German, but wrote in German, English, whatever they wrote in at the time. I think they all still wrote in German. Nobody wrote in English, in medical text. Dutch, you didn't write because nobody could read it, but they wrote German. They changed it. Science was German."

            "question": "Tell me about your brothers and sisters?",
            "answer": "Brothers and sisters. The oldest sister was a woman, was a girl and she died after Bergen-Belsen. Nobody knows about this. I never mention her in the diary. She was over 40. She was born in 1906 so if the war was from 1943 to '45 she was over 40 or close to 40 and anybody who got typhus died over 40 because of the high consistent fever for 15 to 16 days and whatever. She lived outside of Holland for part of her married life. She was married to a doctor in Czechoslovakia and then came my second brother. My second brother, Peter, studied medicine and biochemistry and also got into endocrinology. He immigrated to South America just before 1940, in 1939 because there was a branch of the factory which made the hormones, Organon, which was part of Hoffman La-Roche. So, there was a combination of pharmaceutical, endocrinology pharmacology on that side. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection My brother, Peter, was an M.D. and Ph.D. and in South America. He emigrated later on after the war in 1946 to New York and switched to psychiatry because of the drugs. The third brother was five years older than I. He did study medicine, but flunked out because he had the feeling, you know, you studied medicine because your father and your brother studied medicine. And he became a businessman, first photography and film in the 1930. Went to the Berlin Olympiad to film. I just saw on PBS the other day and I realized that Hein my brother was there for the Olympiad just to film. He was born in \u201814 so he was 22, 24. I guess. And the younger sister, Lilo, 1s the one who lives in Boston. She was born in 1922. Went to school in Amsterdam. All the other kids went to normal schools. They went to public schools. Nobody went to this Lutheran Calvinistic outfit where I went. None of them was as Christian as I was, because I saw it. I have to pray and I also tried to become a Catholic but that's a different story. I had a Catholic boyfriend, but never Jewish. So, Lilo married in Holland a German refugee who was in international insurance, marine insurance with whom she immigrated in 1947 to New York and she lived in West Westchester and had three children and is today retired in Boston. She's a registered nurse. Again, medicine, there's always medicine somewhere. That's the kids. Now, my mother died in 1959 and my father died in 1967! in a very strange situation. He was with ' Renata misspoke here; her father died in 1947 not 1967. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection his girlfriend in Switzerland and he was somewhere in Zermatt near the very high mountains and the Swiss Post Auto, you know, one of those busses squeezed a woman who was running against the wall and she died. And he, as a physician, was called in and while he was administering help to this woman, he died of a heart attack. He had a bad heart, bad kidneys, bad heart, so this is the story of my father and there were write ups all over the New York Times, all over Europe. Ernst Laqueur died while he was trying to help somebody not to die. A question..."

            "answer": "That\u2019s an interesting question. First let me tell you about the food. The food was always too much and too heavy. Everybody was heavy. I learned. My people in New York told me I want to be -- what do you want to be. I said, \u201cI want to be what I should be.\u201d She said, \u201cYou cut everything you eat in half.\u201d* I never went on a diet. I lost what I had to lose and stayed that way for the rest of my life. Father disciplined because children were brought up not to talk unless they were asked questions. Children were there to be looked at, but not to be heard. We were very well brought up. We also had nannies. We had a nanny, we had a cook, we had whatever and the nanny was, in many ways, more important than the mother. The mother was there when you were sick and when you were in trouble with your father, she would mediate. ?

She was that forceful. She ran the house in many ways and my father was the guy behind the desk, always on the phone, always public relations. I learned public relations from him. Public relations before the word existed. Team work, working with people was my father. My mother was an individualist and totally you do what you feel like as long as you don't run into trouble with the law, and that's it."

I never talked about that because to me it's so natural that I always knew he had girlfriends, but I also knew that the girl friends were not sexual and this is something which I never understood. Girlfriends were achievements. They were either just -- I hope this doesn't go anywhere because this is purely personal -- they were either very beautiful or very famous or both or they needed him because he could provide whatever they wanted. It wasn\u2019t persecution. It was a very complex relationship because I think sexually he didn't function. I found that out by talking to one of them. I mean, I was the one who became very...and there was another thing. I had tremendous https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection problems as a teenager and as a young woman because my father was afraid of temperament. Afraid of passion, afraid of sexual involvement and he warned me, he said you're dark. I was dark. Today I'm gray. You look like a gypsy and you look aggressive. I didn't even know what he was talking about but I understood much later that this was his fear. He loved me and he said, \u201cYou will never need to do anything except get married.\u201d I think I started at the ripe old age between 40 and 51 to prove that I could do other things but get married. But when you ask me, \u201cDid they love each other?\u201d They may have been in love for a very short time, but again to give you the 19th century, when he married my mother, who was, of course, a virgin when he married her in 1905, he said, \u201cIf you don't have a son or a daughter in a year, it's over.\u201d So, in other words, he wanted to propagate and I don't know -- I don't know whether these stories are true but this is what I remember in my family and there are other things that I remember which are not showing love. You're so long together, you stick it out."

For instance, he never forgave me that I went back to Germany. He never forgave me that I wrote the dissertation and that I kind of published our background in the sense of, from my grandparents already tried to escape. \u201cAnd now you https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection describe this whole business again, what it was to be a German, now you get involved in the whole Hitler aftermath.\u201d That became very difficult because I thought, \u201cHow narrow minded can you be. You know damn well it's not my problem.\u201d I am delighted that I survived and I had the guts to write a diary. Then somebody else picked it up and published it. I gave it to a publisher because it was there in Holland, it was nothing. It was typed, but I never did anything with it. I have actually never done anything until now.

Even when I came to New York and I wanted to study I talked Columbia and NYU into giving me a year off so I got instead of 128 points I only had to do whatever and I said no science. I'm never going to go anything with science. I regret it today because I ended up in medicine at the age of 60, but anyway. I liked going to school. I liked to learn and I like kids and I like to be with people. I have no problems. I had a very good childhood. I was strong, tough and I loved to just play. No, beef at all.

I think in my Gymnasium class, I graduated in '38, there was definitely a color line against the people from the colonies, Javanese, what you call the Katjang and there was Anti-Semitism and Anti-Catholicism. There was a lot of anti- stuff. Protestant versus Catholics reminds of Ireland and Holland. You have a very strong division line where the river, the Rhine, and the--anything below is Catholic and anything above is Protestant.

I said, \u201cThat's it. Who wants to go to Spain.\u201d This biased we were. Because the 80 years war never stopped in Holland. That's why I understand the Irish so well."

            "answer": "Anti-Semitism in the sense that they thought Jews were people who--Wall Street--didn't exist for us, but who were were either bankers or, usurers, medieval thing, or they were selling oranges on the street or, what is it? Voddeman. Old clothes.* So, Jews were either bankers... They were neither lawyers or doctors. Not like in New York or in America. But there were these kind of medieval restrictive kind of thoughts and yet Holland is the place after all with Erasmus and the philosophy and the Jewish philosophers. So, it's a weird place to grow up. Very advanced and very restricted. Advanced in the sense that there were sea farers and everything with the sea and broadening the horizon and going all over the world and being Dutch meant that you traveled and at the same time being very narrow minded. Sitting behind a tiny little window and looking into the street.

            "answer": "No, I didn't identify in the sense except for a feeling of gratefulness and thank God I'm in Holland. To me feeling that anything would happen in Holland didn't occur to me. That didn't occur until we got the Wehrmacht, the orders from the occupational army to fill in forms that you had Jewish grandparents and I remember my wild resentment to my father. I said, \u201cDon't be such a goddamn Prussian, don't fill in anything.\u201d Ifhe wouldn't have filled it in we would have been all okay. Because--That's why I kept saying Prussian prejudice and Prussian education. There's another problem that also comes out in the book Schreiben KZ in the introduction, because my German editors insisted that I give my story about my father and he said, \"If you don't give it we have it in the Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitung Archives.\" So I said, \u201cOkay, here it is\u2019. He is born in 1880. He is a German. He 1s a medical professional. He is a teacher at the universities, various universities. The war breaks out in 1914. He is a German. He volunteers into the army as a medical officer. Imagine growing up in Holland and having a father who was a volunteer in the German army. Okay, number one, he is then, because he is a Pharmacologist he is being sent to Belgium. In Belgium the have a Gas Schule, a Gas School in Berlin where they experiment with poisonous gas for the war. From '14 to '18 Laqueur is in the gas schule. He only does research. He has no idea what the research is for, but he does research as a Pharmacologist. He's being sent to Belgium as an occupation army, you know, from '14 to '18. He ends up with a death sentence in Belgium because they say, \u201cIf you ever come back we'll kill you.\u201d So, for the https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection rest of his life, when we were children, he travels to Switzerland where we have a chalet in the summer. He travels on the Belgium French side, we travel in the third railroad car with my mother on the German side\u201d. These are the things they knew in Germany and my friend and editor Martina in Frankfurt said, \u201cRenata, if you don't tell us these stories we have them anyway because the Germans knew about this.\u201d I think it's only funny, but of course I don't blame my father. If you were an American and if ...we have never been occupied in America, but if the occupational-- yes we have been occupiers. We have occupied Germany. We have occupied whatever. So, if you then do something because your government tells you to do this or that, do you or don't you? But there are other things which made me nervous about this interview because my own bad conscience comes in, I hated to be my father's daughter in Holland. I never forget the last talk I had with my father in 1947 before he went to Switzerland and he was a sick man, he had cardio and kidney problems and I said, \u201c\u201cWhy did you go into the army?\u201d Why this or that and he simply had no other explanation but, \u201cThis is my duty.\u201d Again the Prussian.

But they left him until the end of the war. Of course there were stories about it that he sold his children to the concentration camp because he could stay home. Nonsense. It had nothing to do with him. We were arrested because we were Jewish. We had a \"J\" and I had done some illegal stuff, and a...and stuff, documents. It's a very complicated story. Anyway I ended up in prison in Amsterdam and then a Dutch concentration camp which was worse than anything else. Then being shipped to Westerbork and then my father, with his good connections in the Hague and with Berlin, got me out of Westerbork and I came back out. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Then Paul and I said to my father, \u201cNow it's time that we go underground, because I don't want to be shipped ever again to Westerbork.\u201d The transportations were going to the East. We didn't know what happened there, but I didn't want to be shipped. He said, \u201cYou can't do this. You just stay where you are. I will try to salvage whatever I can.\u201d He bought us Ecuadorian passports. We got Venezuelan passports. We got immigration stuff to go to Palestine. We had everything, every paper in the world. Then we got picked up because with the Germans there was always one word, Bis auf Wieteres, until further notice. So, in other words, if you had an exemption that could explode from one hour to the next, and our so called Stempel, stamp had expired and we were shipped to a so called preference camp which was Bergen-Belsen.

            "answer": "That also has to do with the war. I met Paul in May '40 when we were overrun by the Germans. I meet him bicycling with a member of a family that I knew and I meet him and we fall in love. It's May, June 1940. He's my first man and being well brought up you marry the first https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection man. We have a love affair and then I tell my father that I slept with him and he almost killed me for that. I said, \u201cDon't worry, we'll get married.\u201d He said, \u201cYou shouldn't get married because you will get divorced right after.\u201d He was right, but he said, \u201cDo you want to marry?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I want to marry because otherwise we can't live together.\u201d Because there were certain orders from the Germans that you couldn't live in this city and in that city you had to live together. They were making restrictions on where you lived and what you did and so on. It was the ghetto mentality already. So, Paul and I got married and the two fathers, Father Goldschmidt, Paul Goldschmidt, his ancestry was German but he had been three or four generations in Holland and Father Goldschmidt and Father Laqueur got together and said, \u201cThose kids are going to get divorced as soon as the war is over. What do we do about our money?\u201d So, they said that each kid whatever they brought into the marriage would go back into their own family, and boy did that happen. But this is really very personal. When Paul and I got divorced in the 1950s, after I met my second husband -- this is a story I have to tell you, but it's purely personal. Anyway, to get to the money first, it got divided very nicely except that Paul said, \u201cI can never pay you for saving my life.\u201d I said, \u201cYou don't pay me. That\u2019s a natural. I either saved your life or I let you rot.\u201d So, whatever it was we got very amicably divorced. I gave him some share of my father\u2019s LaRoche Organon stuff and he gave me some other stuff, but these are civilized marriages. \u00b0 \u00b0 Renata Laqueur has added an addendum to her interview release form in regards to the words: \u201cLaRoche Organon.\u201d She does not permit these words to be used in any publication or production, including literary, print, audio, audio-visual, computer-based or any other medium now known or which may be created in the future. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection We are still friends. The story of how I met Paul and how I met my second husband. Paul had been a speech therapist. He had dyslexia and that way got into speech trouble and interested in psychology and psychiatry but he had never made the Gymnasium so he could never study medicine. 1950, after the war, there were stories, there were children and also no children and all kinds of things. In 1950 the first international speech therapy congress convention 1s in Amsterdam and Paul says to me, \u201cDo you want to work for that? Do something because you're good with people and good with money and all that.\u201d And I said, \u201cI will be the treasurer.\u201d I'm the treasurer, the general secretary of that international convention comes from New York. He is Deso A. Weiss, M.D. He has been Paul's teacher when he was a kid studying in Vienna, because he came from Austria, Vienna, Prague, whatever. Paul knew him and admired him as his teacher and his professor. He was 18 years older than me so he was also 13 years older than Paul. He said, \u201cDon't ever start anything with him because one of these days I'm going to America and I don't want my wife to have a relationship with my professor.\u201d You only have to say, \u201cDon\u2019t start,\u2019 and Renata starts. A week after I meet this guy, ten days, I said to Paul, \"Paul, you're absolutely right.\" He doesn't know it yet, but I\u2019m going to get this guy. I'm going to marry him.\u201d He was in a bad marriage, no children. I knew about that. It had nothing to do with anything. I achieved that after four years. He was my second husband. He was the great love of my life. That\u2019s Paul, Deso, and Renata. Everything was very friendly, very whatever. How did I https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection meet Paul, we were young. We had the first sex and he liked my family. He said it was the craziest family he ever married into. I liked his too, but they were different. They were very formal, very -- totally different background. Totally business people, very rich. Not showy but very established and we were so bohemian. I've been talking for an hour. You said you wanted to give me a break after half an hour. How much more do we have to do?"

I think nobody really reacted wrong because I didn't know anybody who was in the pro- Hitler. And don't forget that it is a very free and open society and democratic which is over run by a tyrant so that they were all against him. And whether I was singled out, they were singled out if they were Catholic or Communist or homosexual or whatever. There were so many people singled out. It wasn't just Jews. You were a victim because, you were what do you call it? Occupied. Occupied means they sit on top of you and you have restrictions. Almost everybody had restrictions. The Jews had different restrictions than other people. There was constant curfew. There was black out. It just occurs to me that the atmosphere between 1940, I was only there from 1940 to 1943 was one of constant interference with people's lives. You couldn't just go to school and learn, you had to learn what they said was okay. You couldn't just sit in a street car because maybe there was a Wehrmacht, or a general or whatever. Maybe there was a razzia\u2019 on the street and they were rounding up people to go to work camps or Jews to go to whatever. \u2019 Razzia: a roundup (Italian). https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection There was always something going on which had to do with the occupation. I cannot differentiate occupation from personal persecution because I didn't suffer really any personal persecution, never. I was very lucky. I wasn't dragged by my hair. I wasn't tortured. I wasn't threatened except once during the first interrogation in the prison. That was no fun, but they said, \u201cIf you don't tell us where you have those papers from,\u201d I had false papers, I\u00ae said, \u201cWe're going to stick you in the water until you talk.\u201d I said, \u201c Then I can't talk.\u201d I mean to give you examples. I have had situations where personal chutzpah has saved my life. One of them is I think in the diary. I walked in Bergen Belsen on a very hot July afternoon. We came back from work and I was working in the kitchen. I was working in the kitchen because not only could I eat, but I could steal for Paul and there was a can of pork meat. As a Jew you don't like pork meat but when you're hungry who cares. And I take the pork meat, the can and I turned it inside into my bra and I had work overalls and I walk through the gate where the SS is to count us, you know ,when we come back and I had no idea that there was a fat stain from here to there over my left bosom and the SS man says, \u201cWas ist los? What's the matter with you? Ihnen geht wohl die Milch ab? You lose your milk?\u201d I said yes, \u201cThat's what it is, can I please go quickly back to the barrack and wash myself because this is awful.\u201d At the same time I had under my hair which was long and I had a net under it, a half of pound of margarine or butter. So, if they would have caught me -- I mean I was lucky. But you see, when the guy says, \u201cWe stick you in the water until you talk,\u201d I said, \u201cThen I can't talk.\u201d I yelled right back and he also. I mean, I was lucky. But these are personal things and I was terribly afraid of torture, terribly afraid of pain, terribly afraid of it. But these are always things you hear or dream about and are scared -- still I\u2019m terrified of certain things.

This is what I remember and they said, \u201cWe have a warrant for your arrest.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat for?\u201d They said \u201cYou'll find out when we take you to our jail.\u201d So, I told myself, \u201cDutch jail, that's not too bad. That's not Gestapo.\u201d Dutch jail was under the Gestapo. I found out why there were Germans. And then they more or less -- I don't remember the thing because I've repressed this whole thing so much. They confronted me with the fact that they had my papers and of course I was going to a concentration camp, if not worse, you know, whatever they threatened and I ended up in jail and I ended up in jail with -- a Dutch jail -- with about six women in a one person cell. I only remember the smell, the closeness, and the fear. And I don't know how many days but the whole thing lasted about ten days and then I was shipped to a Dutch concentration camp in the South of Holland and I had a stamp on my 1.d. card, which was not a regular...which says S, which means Straf Fall, so I was a punishment case. This is how I was delivered into Vught and Vught would transmit me to Westerbork and Westerbork would transport me eventually to the east. We didn't know anything. This was 1943. I was, I think, four weeks in Vught."

You could get packages. There was music. There was theater.

            "question": "So, that must have been a very difficult situation in the camp?",
            "answer": "Yes, but we didn't know what they were leaving for. They were leaving very often, very optimistic because they were going to work. There were no transports yet of old people, sick people. No, nothing. This was also, if I remember it well, I have to be careful now because I'm beginning to wonder whether I know it from what I read or what I really went through. To my mind, \u2018til July 1943, there were no transportation yet of the people from mental institutions or the old people or -- there were always Straf transports, which is punishment and we wondered what happened to those people. Because we didn't know whether these guys were put to work let's say in the \"mines\" in Mauthausen. We knew that Mauthausen was very bad. We knew about that. We knew about the mines. We knew about the chemical factories in Germany. We knew a little about Poland. We knew mainly about Germany. Don't forget concentration camps were in Germany. Something which I also found out with the dissertation, no real, what do you call it, annihilation, last solution with gas was in Germany. They're all in Poland. Not in Austria, not in Germany. They were built east of where I was born, in Silesia. I always wonder why. Did they really think it would make the difference. They would get points. It's interesting. Anyway, where were we? The five months. Somewhere if I can improvise, there was nothing quite as bad as the fear of being arrested. Once you were arrested, you were rolling with the punches. Because what you imagine is all from my experiences 1s almost worse, you can't imagine things which happened later on. I didn't know I would live among the dead and the sick and the hungry. I didn't know what hunger was. I didn't know https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection what dehumanization was. I didn't know.

And I don't know if they went to Birkenau or Auschwitz or wherever they went. Of course I made friends. But again this 1s all like a dark hole. I don't remember names. I don't remember faces. I only know of certain circumstances. I think the whole thing about the camps to me is everything I wrote in Bergen-Belsen are facts. Everything I did before and after are part of a mechanism where I somewhere struggled to stay above it, not get involved again. Talking about friends, talking about family, talking about pain or illness, about whatever, but I can tell you one thing, it all came back. Under anesthesia and when I had cancer and I was at Sloan-Kettering, 1992, https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection they find colon cancer, invasion of the lymph nodes, chemotherapy, the works at Sloan- Kettering. I'm again dreaming and fighting being strapped, being tethered to a certain thing - my fight with the chemotherapist that I had to be once a week at Sloan-Kettering for a year. After five months they stopped it because I had too many side effects. But I tell you, this is something that goes so deep that I fight anytime when I need anesthesia whatever, even at the dentist. Since the war, I will not go under unless they absolutely hit me. Because I'm out of control. I need control to survive. And that goes very deep because if you ask me about friends, love, decency, everything stops because I went through so much which I didn't like what I did. Among other things I ate Paul's bread, Paul's ration. The guy was six foot three and I'm just a little person in comparison and I ate his bread and I did things which are not -- it's sheer survival. One thing I never done and I'm very proud of it, I've never done any prostitution. I had occasion, but I didn't do it. Not because of moral thing, because I told myself that's stupid. Because you do it with one you have to do , it with a couple of other people. So, I have no moral convictions and I came out totally an amoral person. It went so far that Paul said in 1945 when we were back home, that he said, \u201cYou've got to see a psychiatrist because you are totally demoralized. You don't know anymore what is right or wrong. You pick up anything you like because you think they owe it to you. Whether it's an ashtray or a cigarette or a piece of meat or a piece of whatever, you steal, you organize. You have no values. You have no respect for anything.\u201d I went into therapy. It took about six months and then he said to me, \"Renata, you can do it yourself.\" I said, \u201cWho's paying whom anyway?\u201d But whatever, I learned. I learned because if you live in a normal life where not everything is https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection topsy turvy you better adjust because otherwise you can't survive. So, I survived the other way. But I'm very bitter. I'm very bitter about things and especially when people complain and when people say, \u201cOh, but if Hitler wouldn't have been there and if this and this and this wouldn't have happened and if I wouldn't have come to America and maybe I should have done this...\u201d I say, \"It's all up to you. Don't blame anybody. You came through anything. The only people you have to live with eventually is you. If you can look into the mirror in the morning and say it's okay, I'm neither criminal nor an addict nor a this or a that, it's fine.\u201d But what you do under I would say the ultimate circumstance of either being dead or alive, I have no judgment and no prejudice about that. I can understand that. I'm always afraid of torture in the sense that if I've been I would do anything and I wouldn't blame anybody who has betrayed a secret or an organization or anything. Do you understand what I'm talking about? What I'm so worried about is I'm put in a position where I have to make a real decision what will happen to somebody else. Let's say a situation where you know that your husband or your child or your father or your mother or your friend is being tortured or beaten and that you could save them but you know damn well you can't save them because they beat them anyway and they will kill you too. Joan, I don't like this digging into the past. People have very often said to me, \u201c Renata, why are you doing this? Why are you going to Germany. Why do you go now to the Holocaust Museum and give them an interview? Haven't you been through enough? Why do you have to do it at all?\u201d I said, \u201cGod knows somebody else can learn something.\u201d If you ask me one question, I'm asking you as if I were you. Would you do anything different than what I did. I would say \u201cYes.\u201d I would not have https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection stayed in Holland. I would have accepted an invitation in 1939 to go to Berkeley. I had a friend who wanted me to go to Berkeley and who knows? But otherwise, I might not write another diary although I still write diaries today. I can't do anything unless I write it down. I really am like the person who says I haven't lived anything until I have written it down. Because then you objectify. You're kind of above it, not any more in it. I never write in Bergen-Belsen in order to sit 52 years later in Washington and talk about things because I didn't think it would ever be read by anybody, not even by me. It was my survival mechanism if I write about it, I objectify. I rise above it because other people were drawing or reciting poetry or thinking about food or thinking about the past. This is where we are different from animals, I think. We have a brain."

Yes, of course there were guards and there was barbed wire but very far away. It wasn't right -- the guards were not all over the place like in Bergen-Belsen or in the concentration camp inVught. It was kind of a family interment camp. I think why I remember so little is that what came afterwards left its mark much more. And don't forget, physically what I have been through since Westerbork, typhus, encephalitis, you name it I've had it. The cancer hasn't helped, especially the chemotherapy, but that's over now. I see my surgeon Friday. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection"

They are the Dutch police and they say, \u201cWe have a warrant for your arrest. You're going to jail.\u201d Now, it was right near the central part of Amsterdam. I said what can I take? He said you can take anything you want to for a few days.

This is...It was the worst thing the people could do to you and I remember that in one of the camps where the women had long hair and they took away the comb which would hold up -- at that time everything was walled, remember, and they took it away. They took the bras away and they took the combs away because they knew that the women would suffer from that. Leave it to women. So anyway, I don't know why I took my lipstick. I don't know why I took perfume, but it was something that would remind me of the civilized world. Let me give you another example. When I had a test in English at NYU Professor Edel the James scholar, gave us a question, \u201cWhat would you take if you were on an uninhabited island and if you know you would never come back, which book?\u201d Most people had either the Bible or Hamlet or whatever. What did I have? Madame Bovary. So, Edel said , \u201cwhy?\u201d I said, \u201cThe food, the clothes, the ambiance, the discussions, the love, the whole thing. It's all so bourgeois and that I would miss. So, why does anybody take whatever it is that's very personal? Reaching back in order to stay on a certain level. I don't think today I would take the toilet water, but I don't know. I think I would take a thermometer."

And when you come into the camp there are these barracks which are dark, between dark green and brown and nothing but sand and mud and it started raining of course. It always rains. The first impression was freedom is trees and a camp is mud and a barrack. And of course guards and dogs. That's the first impression. That was very different from Westerbork. An interesting thing, they put me in 1985 on the so called train Rampe\u2019\u00ae, you know, the platform and filmed there and asked me, \u201cWhat do you remember of this?\u201d And there were Canadians from the NATO at that time and we were eating ice cream and I said I don't remember eating ice cream at the entrance where the trains came in.

But this feeling of it doesn't make any sense. Here I am in '43 I'm 23 years old at that point, and I'm only beginning to live and I'm somehow cut off from anything which I had hoped for and envisioned. This reminds me a little bit of Anne Frank. And Frank had these moments too in which she said, \"It doesn't make any sense.\" You have actually again we come to my favorite word \"choice.\" There are no choices. The only choices I have at that point in Bergen-Belsen 1s to roll with the punches and try to come out. I didn't know how bad it would get but the whole thing doesn't make any sense.

I say somewhere in the diary, I say I think around the 15th of June, I said, \"There's another one who keeps talking about the concentration camp.

He couldn't walk fast enough. He was trailing behind so I lost him. I told myself, I must have thought, \u201cGood riddance,\u201d and at the same time, \u201cGod now what.\u201d When we got to the train, I got somehow in the train. I was with the psychiatrist and his son. The son's a psychiatrist who, I'll give you the address now, who survived, and I said, \"Where's Paul.\u201d He said, \u201cPaul is over there. Try to get him into the train somewhere.\u201d So Paul got into a carriage, three or four carriages behind mine. And somehow I used every connection, every possibility I had to get him into my carriage. And in my carriage he was lying on the floor near the door and near the toilet and I was still sitting and he was lying there and he couldn't move. He couldn't cough. He couldn't swallow. He was dying. And I told myself, \u201cYou better do something.\u201d https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection And I began to do things. I began to find water. I began to find whatever I could find outside the carriage, a raw potato, this or that. Once we got bread and so on. And I began to organize with that psychiatrist\u2019s son, Louis M. Tas. We went and we went into the fields and you read the story about when we go into the mine fields and we try to get beets and carrots and potatoes and whatever and we go into German houses and we bring food back and I spoon fed Paul back into life. Then we get into the Russian liberation camp, the hospital and then I get typhus. And just...Just in that time Paul begins to sit up and he begins to spoon feed me sugar, tea because I have had this incredible high fever and encephalitis. I had these tremendous headaches and he feeds me and I have fed him and this becomes a relationship which has to stop because we basically hate each other. We hate each other. We have survived something we didn't want. He is at that time -- I'm 24 and he's going on 29 and I want so many different things from him. He wants to get back to his \"speech therapy\" and maybe finally get into medical school if he can ever get a diploma. I want to go and have food and fun and Paris...., Paris for becoming a fashion designer. It never occurred to me to do anything else. I had doodled in Bergen-Belsen. The doodles are in the diary by the way and they\u2019re in an exposition in Bergen-Belsen. But anyway, we are growing apart like this because we are totally different. He gets depressed again. I get--I have to get my morals again. We grow apart and we try to stay together by having a family. So, I have one miscarriage after another. Finally we have a child. The child is eight and half months pregnant and it chokes itself inside my belly. It's born dead. That's the end of the marriage. That is 1947 in the fall. He has his girlfriend and I have my boyfriends and we finally decide in '50 when Deso has arrived in '50, he said, \u201cThat's the man you should have married.\u201d \u00b03 RL: \u201cThe child is eight and a half months into my pregnancy.\u201d https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection And we remained friends. The interesting thing is he always...he didn't want children. He said, \u201cI don't want children in this depressing world. What the hell. Maybe we adopt, maybe we should have somebody else's child, an orphan from the war or whatever.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, if we have a child, it's our child.\u201d He said, \u201cI don't want any children.\u201d He marries the second time. He has four children."

            "question": "Do you know his children?",
            "answer": "Not only do I know his children, I know his wife. I became very good friends with her. She was a young Dutch, half nobility, half whatever, totally Dutch. And she was the one whom I asked before I went to America in 1952 I said Helene you have been living with Paul...And we divorced in '50, and in '52 I finally immigrated to Canada. I couldn't go to America because I was born in Germany and the German quota was full and I couldn't get out. So, I went to Canada on my Dutch passport. I went to Helene, and I said, \u201cWhy don't you marry Paul finally. I am leaving.\u201d She said, \u201cI won't marry a Jew.\u201d I said, \u201cYou won't what?\u201d I said, \u201cYou've been living with the guy. He has been baptized. Already his father is this.\u201d She said, \u201cI won't marry him because my family wouldn't stand for it.\u201d I said, \u201cScrew you. I can't do that. You can't live with a guy and fall in love with him and not marry him.\u201d She married him and she had four children with him. Finally she got breast cancer. She died. But they were divorced already. He found a friend in Germany where he had moved because he could easier find work in Germany in his field than in Holland. A long story, nothing to do with me. And the interesting thing is that Paul always said, \u201cOne of the best things which ever happened to me is not that you saved my life but that we met and it was wonderful.\u201d https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection That's nice. That is nice. \u201cYou saved my life, of course it's wonderful.\u201d But he is so depressed that he sometimes feels, \u201cWhat's life?\u201d I don't know. Last question, what do you want to know besides this? You must be dead tired. These are all stories of other people and how they relate, this is not necessarily a Holocaust story because it has nothing to do with the horror of Auschwitz and Birkenau. If you're being shoved into the gas, it's much, much worse I think than being starved and diseased. I don't know. I think because this is the final victimization because even if you are dying of hunger, even though you're dying of disease, you still have a certain control. If you're being pushed into a shower and it turns out to poison you...This is my fear of the anesthesia also. Anything which is done to me where I can't be in control."

An unbelievable amount of dying percentage wise because people were dying of disease and starvation, but that's a different death than by being pushed into -- I don't know. To me it's much more horrible. Because it's so phony, it's so typical German. You tell them they're going to have a shower. You tell them, \u201cYou're going to be disinfected.\u201d You're being killed. In Bergen-Belsen they didn't tell you that we're not going to kill you. They said we don't give a shit whether you die.

Renata meant to say here: \u201cJuly 16, 1996 and I am reading here https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection about after the war. Will we ever be able to convey what these camp years have meant for us when we talk with someone who has not actually lived through a similar experience himself. What it is like to see from behind barbed wire, tall, green fir trees and new vegetable crops growing along the camp road, what the constant pressure and coercion by SS guards and their perennial check ups really mean. How you try all the time to convince yourself that it does not touch you. All this shouting, cursing and kicking that you notice that you're growing older and that you're used to slipping through your fingers in these long years of waiting for the end of oppression. What the months mean when you count them in hours, days and weeks. And in which the only bright spots are sleep, warm soup, and sometimes a ray of sun on the way back to the barracks after another endless roll call in the damp chill of the big center Appell fields. Good moments also, the thoughts and dreams about before. Homesick and more homesick and whether it's the Frenchwomen who sing about \u201cParee, Paree,\u201d or the Italians in their brightly patched Mediterranean get ups or the Greek, Spanish Jews from Salonika. They all think of and yearn for only one single thing: home, going home after the war. And what is home? Will we be able to find our way back from the concentration camp universe into a world in which most of us have no longer any other possessions than the memories of before the war and in which we will live among people to whom our years of imprisonment will only mean --\"Oh, there's another one of those who only complain about lost things and tell horror stories.\" This is true. Now, if you put this while you're there how much have you written yourself out of the situation. I climbed above it, out of it and was neither in the past or in the future but I was me. They couldn't take it away and I think this is not only me, this is where I feel this camp diaries are crucial to show what human beings could do with their brain. Write themselves above, out, my Bergen-Belsen diary entry, made on Thursday, June 15, 1944.\u201d https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and through it."
