You never said your own name, but you had a fake name, just in case, to be on the safe side. So Bonzo 1s that little dog, look like a bulldog, you know? Feisty, and very determined, and you don\u2019t get rid of that dog very easy."

            "answer": "Yeah, we had -- we had servants. Of course, all Indonesian, and they were watching us, and they -- they cleaned the house, they were cooking, and doing the laundry, and the laundry was done in the river, and that was slammed on the -- on the rocks. And then a little bit further was someone brushing the teeth. That was life in Indonesia. We always had protection, we always had people with a gun, just in case, because it was always kind of difficult times. And well, for the rest, it was -- it was very protective. You could not go out, for instance, to the pussar by yourself. The pussar 1s like a department place, where you buy st-stuff from outside, because you could get on the back a knife. So why would you provoke that? There\u2019s off -- obviously we have a -- an -- an -- a white skin, while the population is brown skinned, so -- but mostly they had respect. After all, we -- we were a colony, and if we had to complain, it was not very, very difficult to put a person in -- 1n jail. And in those days no lawyers to defend. If -- if you got a complain, no questions asked, there you go. That was the way it happened."

            "question": "And what was it like when you went back to -- where your parent -- well, where your family originally was from -- from the Netherlands?",
            "answer": "Yeah, yeah, to the Netherlands -- see, my father was born in Amsterdam, so his parents were in Holland, and my mother\u2019s parents were still in Indonesia. And well, we just lived in -- in the street, I can remember that, was a -- a -- a house over -- over the entrance of a garage, so I remember it was always cold, because the wind always goes through that -- that entrance. Why they picked that house, I never could understand that. And the school was close by, we could walk. In the Netherlands, you don\u2019t have that system as here, that the school buses, you just go on the bike, or you pick a school close to your house, that\u2019s how it was there. And it was always raining. Holland is always damp-y, and -- you get used to that, too, th-the raincoat was way until the ankles. And you had beautiful skin, because always wet, you know, always pinky. And you just take things the way it happens, no complain. You don\u2019t know anything better. But I do realize that my mother was relieved because my mother was not accustomed to the Indonesian climate. See, over there, you have six -- six months that it is pouring rain, and six months is it so dry that we had red earth in the ears, and in the nose, and on -- because of the dust. So that was what we called the dry season. And then the wet season was -- if it was always pouring rain, no, if it was raining, if you would stand in -- on the street, and the rain would fall, on this side you were wet, on this side you was dry. I never forget that, and it was always six o\u2019clock."

            "question": "So you actually have a lot memories of Indonesia?",
            "answer": "Oh, definitely. I had my own monkey. I had my own parrot, white with a little tuft. And that parrot was talking, and the monkey was always hugging me, loving me to pieces. I miss that, because here you\u2019re not allowed to have a monkey. But it is companionship, and you feel kind of- you know, you have something that belongs, and that you protect. Cause the natives, of course, they protected you, but they had no interest in you as a person. They only had interest in themselves, to stay safe. We played tennis, and we -- we swam a lot. I remember you -- you went in your pajamas to the movies, that that\u2019s the custom, you know? Nobody\u2019s looking around like she\u2019s crazy, it is just the way that -- that you lived, that way."

            "answer": "In the Netherlands? Oh yeah, but see that was not changed that much. I was the last time in 84, and everything was changed. And that\u2019s why after that, I f -- I told my sister, I have no inclinations to go back, because it is so changed, I don\u2019t re-remember that is my country. It\u2019s all highway, modern buildings, the roads are ap -- you know here the -- the Beltway? In Holland 1s it much worse. Because you have not been prepared. Holland is as -- as small as New Jersey. Everything has to be one way, because the streets are so narrow. In those days -- the houses were built in 12 -- 1200, and then in 16-1700, was mo-more built. So if you go to Amsterdam, or The Hague, the streets you can only walk in. A car would not even move, because it is so shuclocked, you couldn\u2019t make a turn, it was blocked. Y-You don\u2019t even need a traffic sign, because it\u2019s not necessary."

            "num": 15,
            "question": "So where do people leave their cars?",
            "answer": "Well, you have parking space, if you can find one, but it could be two blocks away -- as long as you have your car parked. And that is why we didn\u2019t have a car, we had bikes. I was always on the bike, cause that\u2019s the easy. And you -- you kept your bike in the house, because they were stealing like heck. Now we had the Germans, for instance, we -- we were, for instance, on one end of the street, blocked by trucks, two or three, full of soldiers, and on the other side of the street the same way, so you could not get out, period. And then they were doing rusias. A rusia means that this house to house search, for either a radio, a fur coat, a bike, anything that they could use. And if you would listen to the BBC for news, then you would get down on your knees in front of your front door, ping, out."

            "question": "Oh, you mean if -- if you were discovered listening to the news?",
            "answer": "That\u2019s right. Now, my father -- my whole family is like r-rebels, you know, we -- we do things that you\u2019re not supposed to, but we do it, because we are not told by any big mouth shot, what we can and cannot do. So, my father was always listening. So when we had that search, when the -- I -- I stretch my hand this way on the -- at the door, so they could not pass, and I always had my uniform on, because you have to learn a weakness of a person -- I studied that. So I found out the Germans were always scared for illness, for anything that is contagious. So I told them point blank -- I\u2019m a big liar -- with straight poker face, sorry, but I have a diphtheria patient in the back. Of course not true. So what? And then my father would yell from upstairs, \u201cWho is there?\u201d I said, \u201cDad, this is rotmoff.\u201d That\u2019s Dutch for rotten Jerry. Oh, my father dashed to the - the radio, turn it off, house quiet. So, the Germans didn\u2019t know what I was saying, but they had enough, and get out, they didn\u2019t want to get sick. So that was the way it happened in my house. Now, I don\u2019t know, next door neighbors, because you was very cautious that you didn\u2019t say too much."

            "answer": "Oh yeah, well we are very military. My father graduated in Breedah, say as similar as here, West Point. My younger son graduated from West Point. My older son is from VMI. So we always teased each other. The West Point son said, \u201cYou -- you got to tell sir to me.\u201d Now he\u2019s nine years younger than my older son, so my older son, \u201cYou can go to you know where.\u201d They always were joking, but we were brought up very strict, and my father was a banker, so I learned finances quick. In -- in 1929, with the depression, I got a -- an income of a dime on Sundays, and I had to write everything down on a little book, the expenses, and the income, and if it was not balanced, I would not get my salary."

And if you visit them, they know, \u201cOh yeah, General Von Sweetin.\u201d My mother had a brother who was a captain in the Dutch army. My father was in Hoosar, and that means you have your own horse, and you are in the cavalry. And another brother, who was shot by the Germans in the airport, was a captain in the army, and he was not in the underground, he was in the regular army, but he tried to stop a German airplane, and when he was shooting, while the airplane was landing, they shot him instead, so --"

Now, we have a museum in Brombake, and we have -- that is the Von Sweetin museum, and we have a museum in Leeuwarden, that is the Von Cammingha museum. And we had a castle on the island of Leeuwarden, but that was burned down, and then we had some other castle. You just flow away with castles -- close to Leeuwarden, and I have a booklet there, that 1s now the place of a well known Dutch soccer club -- soccer team. So I got that -- my son went to Holland, and he was very impressed with that, and he was visiting them, and telling them that my mother was here, but I never contacted them, because I was so busy. I still have to do that, though. So they have a team there, on the ground of the -- the castle."

A student nurse. And my sister was born in \u201935, so she was like five to 10 years old during that period, so she was at school. But we were eating in the -- in the living room, I remember that, no central heat in those days, because it was just not existing. The Germans stole anything, everything what was stolable. So we had an -- a stove that was heated by coal, and it smelled horrible, so we had always the window open. And we cooked like tulip bulbs, and -- I have a list of -- of items that we -- we had in those days, because th-th-the stores were just empty. There was no food. And that was on purpose, to let us die out. Simple, you know. You just don\u2019t feed the person, so they have to -- to die. So you saw people walking around as a skeleton, because if you have no family that takes care, and you are by yourself, the only way to get stuff is go to the farm, and exchange like linens, or clothing, and then you got your food, so that\u2019s what we did on the bicycle."

Six girls, all very intelligent, and -- and all playing a musical instrument. I was drawn to that family so -- so much, because they had such a nice attitude, and they were so full of faith, like nothing could happen. They were -- they were not afraid at all. But I warned them, since I was already in that time, informed. I started in 1933 to smell something. I mean, you -- you didn\u2019t have a TV in those days, but if you went to the movies, there was news before the movie started, and I saw the -- the inclination of lots of legs, and lots of parading, big mouth speeches, you know, so I was already in -- in my heart feeling that\u2019s no good. Now, Holland was always neutral, in World War One was -- we were neutral still. We didn\u2019t expect them to get in -- against our rule that we were neutral, and we stayed that way. We made that very clear. The heck with us, that\u2019s their attitude. So our queen was warned on time, Queen Julianna and her kids went to Canada. I have pictures of those, too. My next door neighbor, Rost Von Tunningham, you will not believe that. One brother was with the queen, was always picked up with a horse and buggy, had his uniform with that big type of hat, like an admiral wears in those days. And the other brother was an NSB member. National Sas -- Socialist Bund. So that were two brothers in one family clashing. So was very important that you could trust each other. So I had his name on the list of people that would have been cckk. See, everything in Holland was --"

That 1s just me. I was born with that. And I could have been even psychiatr -- what do you call it, someone that looks 1n the future, because I get always in the mail, people in that field. Now, I\u2019m not stupid, if they say I do a free reading, and then at the end you get a form to fill out, 20 dollars, I send that form nicely back without the 20 dollars, because in the beginning they said it was free.

Some of it 1s instinct, but you mentioned that your family is -- is a family full of very strong characters also. So, let\u2019s go back still to the time before the Germans have come. When you start seeing some news about the Germans, what are people saying? Whe-When are you starting to get very worried, or -- or how is that if you could just sort of explain that progression.",
            "answer": "Okay. In the first place, I was a Girl Scout, in -- in -- in that time was girl -- Girl\u2019s Guide. Course that\u2019s in Holland different. In 1937, I visited the boy\u2019s jamboree. That was in -- in Hilversum. I noticed there were no Germans, so I talked with the American. She w -- in those days, in Holland, you get English, you get German, you get French, if you\u2019re 11 years old. So I had contact with the American soldiers -- Boy Scouts, because I was impressed about their camps, their -- their tents, very efficient. Their equipment, like they had the water thing hanging, and that\u2019s what they got fresh water from. Their whole attitude appealed to me. And then, I was a member of a hockey club. That is field hockey. That is British inclined. Then, of course, I was told you cannot do anything in the uniform, because that 1s -- that\u2019s poor British. So I alr -- already felt there is something fishy going on. Why is this forbidden, why is that forbidden? And it was not even war yet. And if you talk to a Dutch, forbidden means resent. You already start to. In Holland you don\u2019t need a lawyer. If you have a handshake because you agree, that is the promise that you make, and you stick to that. You can trust a Dutch word. You cannot trust a German word. It\u2019s full of lies, it\u2019s full of promises because they want to mellow you. And we are not that way. We are very cautious. So when I saw that shelters were built, when I was told you cannot have lights -- bulbs, like this bright light, forget it. It had to be covered with blue, so the light would go straight down, it would never go outside your window. Now, everybody was taped -- had taped their windows, because ev -- we were bombed. See, if -- then the windows would not break, or it would just hang on the tape. So there were all kind of insinuations. Try to get tires for your bike, because rubber would not be available. It happened. Our bikes were having wooden wheels instead. The word hoarding, here in America, that\u2019s a bad word. I hoard. I hoard strange things, because you never know if you need it to use next time. And that\u2019s one part that they say, you know, in here. But that was happening in those days. You take things in the house, in case. End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B"

This is tape one, side B. So you -- y-you were accumulating really, evidence that something was going wrong.",
            "answer": "We not only got very good information with the BBC, because of course, they had spies all over, already, in that time. But a -- as certain attitudes, like the next door neighbor with the NSB organization, who were against our government, and if you are very much for the queen, and you are in the military, and you take the oath of defending your country, you just don\u2019t take that, you fight back. Not necessarily with a weapon, but you can fight back with sabotage. We sabotaged plenty. So when it was the time for the Germans to go in Holland, they pretended that it was necessary, because they had to in-invade Great Britain. And we just broke the dikes, so the water was -- was all over the bolus. You know, the Netherlands is much lower on the sea level than this country 1s, So we were used that the water would flow down, and you just cope with the fact that you cannot grow anything any more, and everything run -- drowns. But the point was that the German heavy equipment could not go through, see? So the Germans were forced to go over in the air. It was wall to wall airplanes. And they came with -- what do you call that in -- in English. In -- in German is -- it\u2019s falsesharem. Parachutes, parachutes. So, 1t was a nice target to -- to -- from the ground up, to kill those parachutes when they were coming down. I always felt sorry, because those people were their own age, like me. And why would you kill an -- a young boy that is forced to do something he doesn\u2019t want to do? Because, I talked with them. We -- we had the -- you know, that we were on the beach, and I would sneak up on -- on the one guy, he had lots of hair, all black hair. And we -- we made a bet -- the girls around me, you don\u2019t dare. So I sneak behind, and I did like this over his hair. And then he would go, \u201cOh, what are you doing here?\u201d In German, huh. I said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m just -- you know, I\u2019m having a bet, and I won.\u201d Now you can see what a crazy kid I was. So we had talks, and then they -- he said, well, don\u2019t fear us, because we are just in the army, and if we don\u2019t do it, what we are supposed to do, we get killed in our -- our own country. So I found out a lot from them. Besides, I had a girlfriend -- that was after the war, who had a castle in Germany, and she said, \u201cWhen I was on my own grounds, going a certain direction, there was an -- a guard telling me to go back in my castle, because there was something fa -- fishy 1n that area.\u201d\u201d Where the smell came from? Concentration camp. So they had concentration camps all over, and the German population was not supposed to know about it. So, in -- in a way, I -- I always said, I feel like I hate the Germans. I cannot say that, because in every country -- now here, with the politics, you have Republicans, and you have Democrats, also divided. It\u2019s incredible. So it is in every country that way. But you had to be careful, because how did you know?"

            "answer": "No. At that time you had no chance. You was -- see, you need a permit. Everything is done by the government. The government could not be trusted either, was very divided. The queen had to leave. Many people of the government had to escape. So, the government that ti -- that time, was already corrupt. You need a passport, you need a visa, you need permission, you need a sponsor. That all hinders you. So we sp -- we were sponsored after the war, because we could prove that he could come. But if I would dow -- put down on my application, Nazi, or member of that, do you think United States was crazy enough to -- to let me in? See? So -- and we had no intentions. We -- we were ready to fight for what we had to fight. You mean -- I -- I would have been a -- a coward if I would have tried to get out. My job was to protect the people, like the Jews, like the gays, like -- what do you call those people? Gypsies. The Germans had the particular type of person that they did not like, and they were persecuted. So our job was to -- to get coupons so that we could buy food. To get the -- the word Jew off their chest. The -- the word Jew was printed on a star, and that was -- was sewed on -- on any -- any clothing. So if you went on the street, you have to wear that. What we did was take it off, give them another piece of cloth, hide them. They were not allowed in the street any more. Now, yesterday was Kristallnacht. I never forget that either, because any store that belonged to a Jew was smashed in with rocks, with stone that they picked up from the street, because in Holland, every street is done with stones, you don\u2019t see concrete that much. And because my family is pretty religious, my -- my father\u2019s sister belonged to the Haranhurtus. Haranhurtus is a sect that 1s very religious, and -- and has a strong faith, and 1s very optimistic, and helps you. A person with a mental problem, for instance, would feel a lot better if you was in connection with the Haranhurta, because that\u2019s -- that was the way they were living. And so we knew a -- a watchmaker, I never forget that either. Now, my aunt lived in Utrecht, a separate city, and that poor family was stoned, and -- and the window was all busted, and people were helping themselves. All those watches were -- were in -- in the store, or clocks, whatever, they just dragged it out. The man was just robbed death. Just because he was a Jew. So I was very res-resentful, and I tell you, when the war was finished, we let them pay. We let the Germans pay before they went back to -- to the German, to their own country. We let them walk, we didn\u2019t provide any transportation. Now, that is about a three hour walk. And we had the girls who had been dating, put on the table, on the street. We threw them with rotten eggs, rotten tomatoes, and we shaved their hair off completely, to show everybody that girl is a trait -- betrayed -- for a threat. No, we were very mean.

My father belonged to the RNVB, that is here, triple A, similar. So he helped motorists 1n trouble, and stuff like that, and my father was a secretary. Now, I\u2019m 80 now, but I don\u2019t look 80. My father at that time, if you were 16 until 50 I think it was, you was not allowed on the street, you would be picked up and transported to Westerbork. Westerbork was a city close to the German border. You would get stripped from your clothing, and they would give you another ID, and you was then transported to a factory in Germany. To heck with that. So, we -- we got food every day to my brother. My father went once to his office, and it was very foggy that day, and a German shouted in his ear, \u201c\u201cToomshta shoengain.\u201d So my father woke up like, \u201cAre you crazy, I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d So he ran -- we all good runners by the way -- around the shelter in -- in that fog, and he was shot at. He heard, you know, the soldier shooting at him. My father made it at home, and he said, \u201c\u201cGet me under the -- under the floor.\u201d So we did that. Of course, no-nobody came at the door, because they didn\u2019t know, in that fog, where he was anyway. But that was the last. We learned our lesson. So I found that out later -- course I was in - in the hospital that -- that time, and in those days you didn\u2019t tell each other those things, because you would not worry, or make a person worry, because I would not have stayed in the hospital, I would have stayed home to protect.

But since my father was listening to the BBC, and I was involved with scouting, and other things, I mean, you just -- you just had to learn what was going around you, otherwise you could not function. I mean, I was a student nurse, in a way, but in that hospital were plenty people also in the underground. Now, for instance, one day I had the TBC patients. They need fresh air, so they were in the yard. So that ward was -- was empty, and I got this guy running to me, \u201cHide me, hide me.\u201d A Dutch person. I says, \u201cGo on, go on in the bed, don\u2019t move.\u201d Then the German comes right behind him. \u201cDid you see anyone?\u201d Again, I stood like this. I said, \u201cDo you want to get TBC? I didn\u2019t see anyone.\u201d Go eyeball to eyeball. In German. So he understood what he had to deal with. So he -- he looked with respect all of a sudden. First he looked like ch, another woman, like most men do anyway. But I had no intention to let him in. My intention was put my foot out, and then he would stumble over it, and I would jumped on his back, and he would not be alive out that door. That was my intention. So we were pretare -- prepared. So then he -- he ran to the other end of the hall, because he couldn\u2019t get any -- and this guy said, \u201cIs it okay?\u201d I said, \u201cKeep mouth shut, I will tell you.\u201d So I had to find out first if everything was okay, and then we had the cellar, and we put him in that cellar. But the point was, in that time, we did not know the director of that hospital, if he could be trusted. So everything was very risky, and you had to be very careful. But I thought, well, if he goes in that -- in that basement with other people, then th-the -- the principal should be okay. Because he could find that out, if he was the -- the good type of principal."

So they play baseball, and -- and whatever, and I picked up the balls and didn\u2019t return it to them. And then they would yell bloody murder, like saying words I better not repeat -- repeat in there. And one day I had enough of it, and I know karate, I did all -- all kinds of things in my life, all kinds of courses. So, I wrapped my legs around the guys hip, very tight, couldn\u2019t shake me off, and mur -- you see my nails? That is really like a cat. So five nails on this side of his back, five nails on this side of his back. He had no shirt on. The blood was coming out. \u201cOw.\u201d You should have heard him. He could not sleep for five days on his back. And that was the time they didn\u2019t play ball either. Was finished. They still are not looking at me. They are not looking at me, they are scared to death. Now they are now 25, in the meantime, and whatever age, but no, y-you got to show respect. In -- in -- in Holland, also, I was followed by a guy in the dunes once, and I knew there was something in his eyes that I did not like. So, I went around that shelter, and I ran, ran, ran, and I outran him. I have third -- third class medal in racing with eight other high schools from The Hague. And I have that someplace, too. So I -- I was good 1n -- in -- in track and field. I was team leader in my hockey team, and they were also all in the underground. But see, you don\u2019t talk about that. In those days, you played hockey. And if a guy would ask you for a date, I would not accept, just to be on the safe side. I did date, though. I mean, I was not that -- you know. But it was amazing that the guys I liked were all killed. They -- they went over to Belgium, and France, over the mountains, the Pyrenee to France -- to -- to Spain, and they never reached England. And I found that out, too. But, you know, that -- that is the way things happen. I mean, I was careful, I could have been killed sev- several times. Th-There was a V -- V2 for instance, that is a kind of a small type of missile, two streets from my house. Now, you can imagine that you have that here. Some failed, went back where they came from. One shell landed in the roof of my house, right through my bedroom, and I was hiding under the bed, because I was told the mattress will put -- be your protection. So I crawl out, and there it is, big shell, right through the roof. So we could not repair that at the time, because there was nobody to do it. We had to move. The rain was just pouring through. Oh, and then the day that -- that we had the invasion, I was on vacation, and five o\u2019clock in the morning - I never forget that either -- a huge plane goes really diving in the street, between the trees, not even the tops of the trees, but half of the trees, over the street, and -- and -- and -- and bombing the -- the barracks that were on the end of that street. Now, they had horses. We all came out in pajamas and stuff. I saw horses heads, legs, tail. Soldiers without a head were still walking, in a daze, of course, and then they dropped. I-It was so terrible to look at it, I can never forget that. So that was five o\u2019clock in the morning, and that was a holiday, like we have here.

That was their big thing. So, we did anything to get their -- not to steal. So we hide it. In the stores, no food. We had food, but they didn\u2019t see it. We had restaurants. On the window, in German, \u201cDeutsch nicht schwahan.\u201d That means, German not spoken. So they could go the restaurant, they would not get coffee, they would ge -- not get a lunch. They would drop dead with us looking at them with pleasure. I saw once, one of those Germans on the floor, kicked down by a bunch of men. Now, he was literally pummeled against his head, on top of his chest. He could not survive. But that is the Dutch way. If you do that to me, you get 10 times worse. So that spreads around. The Germans did not do too much, what you call killing, because they got it back 10 times worse."

I saw in -- in -- I was once that -- that -- that was another place that I was in the staff of a -- a house for older people, that was close to Arnhem, and of course, you -- you could not use the bike, you had to go with -- with the train. But I was always tempted, but of course, you had to be careful. They were kicking, on the station, little kids, big, big German guy, six foot, with boots, rifle. They would use their -- the butt of the rifle to kick it\u2019s -- in -- in those cattle wagons, for the Jews. And oh, I tell you, my hands were itching to get on the back of that German, and scratch his eyes out. But, there were too many. So you got to be not stupid. Go back in the -- in the -- in the -- 1n the train, and go the way you have to go. But that is what I, after the war, told the Germans, \u201cYou are bastards. I have no respect for you for what you did. And don\u2019t tell me it didn\u2019t happen, either.\u201d I was here a tour guide. I did a course, I was in the bus with the Germans in the front of the bus, and the Dutch 1n the back of the bus. So in Dutch, I told the Dutch, I said, \u201cHi, I speak Dutch.\u201d The German said to me, \u201cYou speak German?\u201d I ignored him. I looked over them. And that\u2019s what I said in Dutch, to the people on the back, and they were clapping. Good luck, Louise, we listen to you. Don\u2019t pay attention. Now that was in the American bus. I shorted them. That is my revenge, in a nice way. But I couldn\u2019t help myself, I had to do it that way."

As a Girl Scout, it is international, so you meet Swedish, you meet -- in those days, were no Russian, either, but I met from all countries, and I corresponded with every country. I had to correspond it in Korea, in -- in Thailand, cause I\u2019m interested in how their culture is. I -- I -- I talked with Muslim, in the airport where I was working, I met a Muslim on his little carpet, in front of my door, I had to step over him. And I told him, how come that you have to pray five times a day, and how can you work? It doesn\u2019t make sense to me, but that\u2019s their religion. So I\u2019m curious, and I\u2019m joking. I always see something funny behind something that is not supposed to be funny. But that is the way it happened. I met Lord and Lady Bayton Powell. They were the founders of the girl boy -- th-the Boy Scouts, and they are British. So that was in Addelboaden, in Switzerland, when I was finished with high school, and my father treated me, he -- he paid for the trip. And I went with A-Ake Larous, that is Swiss and French Girl S -- Girl Scout, Girl Guides. Little kids 12 years old. Di di di di, di di di di, di di di di, in French, you know. And then you was put in little pup tents, like the military, but you could not put your finger against th-the -- the cloth, because the rain -- and it was always raining, would make drips, you know, it would drip. So, of course, they did that, to find out it if that was true. And then I was -- I always had a fear for heights, so I went always like a dog, over the mountain -- the Mont Blan, for instance. I went on my fours, and they were always laughing at me. There goes doggie Lukie. But you learn. And the Alps were beautiful. It was nothing -- and it was always fog, because it is high. So you had always clouds around, and I al-al-al-always wanted to grab in the cloud, to see if my -- my hand would be wet. So you can tell I had crazy ideas. But we -- we had lots of fun. Oh boy, did we have fun, and the food was delicious. It was Swiss food. But there was no German. They were not allowed. So, in those days, \u201833 - \u201834 - \u201835 - \u201836 - \u201937, you could feel the whole atmosphere, wherever you went."

Now, I always wanted to be a student in psychiatrist, or whatever, but I\u2019m -- I\u2019m always intrigued to find out what makes you do the things what you do? And don\u2019t you have any regret? Do you have a conscience? What do you expect after this, from what you do? I had free talks with them. So I never had been arrested, or told you go with me.

That\u2019s what I learned, Oxford English, because the teacher came from Oxford. So he talked like that, too. And the French was like Parisian French. So you go to Paris, I have been in Paris, and they don\u2019t understand you. That\u2019s the funny part. Par-Pardon moi? Pardon moi? They say in French. What do I say funny, is that Russian? So then they turned around like I\u2019m an idiot. But that was the way it goes, and then we talked mostly about things that happen in that time. So about what you eat. In those days, the word sex never came up. That is what I thought later, that is funny. In this country it\u2019s nothing but sex. Every day you hear about that, or you see it on TV. Over there you had no time to think about that, because there was no way, if the boys are hiding, the men are in offices, where do you get that stuff? And obviously, the Dutch are not lesbian.

Because this is not always that you get luck. They -- they sometimes just walk away from you, because a German in Holland, after all, was very weird.

You have to believe first. And if right is right, and wrong is wrong, that\u2019s just it. You don\u2019t ask questions, you live with that. And that\u2019s why my f -- my father\u2019s family was also very strong, and were with this religion, or whatev -- but we stuck to that, and it gives you inner strength. And I have never had fear. I tell you, I have no fear for biting dogs. I had once -- I was nine years old, and my father visited a friend, and he had a dog in a -- 1n a -- in a cage, and in Dutch, beware of dog. So, my father was there, and I looked around, right inside. And the dog was not doing anything. So I was there, my arms around the dog\u2019s head, and I kissed the dog. I was so -- so happy with that dog. So my father was finished, he look for me, and the owner of the dog got a fit. He said to me, \u201cDon\u2019t you read that sign?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, I read it. So what?\u201d Your -- I was nine years old, already so -- and the dog did nothing, absolute nothing. So my father said to that man -- maybe it was my father\u2019s friend, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t make such a fuss about it. She 1s good with him. She is -- she is always good with animals.\u201d And I had once a dog that attacked me, and I had my fist -- now, you always have your thumb inside, not outside, but inside, and I put my fist in his mouth. Not, then the teeth cannot reach each other, so he was stuck. And then I grabbed him with the back, and I lifted him up, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t try it again, buddy.\u201d So I took my hand out. Boy, did he go fast. He was scared. Because I did that, nobody else had done it. So that -- that is the way I am. If -- if you -- if you make me scared, I'll let you know I am not scared, for whatever reason you tried. End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B"

            "question": "This is a continuation of an interview with Louise Segaar, it\u2019s November 10\", in the year 2000. We\u2019re at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. I -- I\u2019m -- maybe I\u2019m backtracking a little bit, but I wonder if you can tell me a little bit more about the role faith did play in your family, h -- when you were growing up, when you were younger, how did you learn about it from your mother and father?",
            "answer": "Attitude. If they -- if they tell us not to do certain bad things, you listen. And their example is a fact. If -- if you beat a person, you know it\u2019s bad, but there must be a reason for doing that. So why would you do it in the first place, unless you are provoked, or attacked, or whatever reason. But that\u2019s the only way you are allowed to do that, because the Bible says, love thy neighbor. It\u2019s so simple. But people don\u2019t follow that up. And that\u2019s why you get all that mess in the world. Why -- why would I be mad at the Chinese person, because the Chinese government is doing this and that and that? That poor Chinese person doesn\u2019t know a thing about the government, and the government tells that person, you shall only have one child, you shall only have two childs -- children. For what? Because the government is influencing. And I had the -- the Indonesian government, I had the Dutch government, I had the German government. Nobody tells me what I can or cannot do, if they don\u2019t set their own sample. I never go to church, either. I have been to church. One time I had a lady, her dress was way here so that you could see her things. Big hat with animal skin type of thing. Then my minister, he went around his wife\u2019s back fooling around. So when I was working in National airport, he comes one day to my desk. \u201cLouise, do you remember me?\u201d I says, \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d He says, \u201cYou know what happened?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cMy -- my oldest boy got a car accident and died.\u201d So I grabbed his hand, I said, \u201cIs that punishment what you did to your wife is now back to your son?\u201d And he looked at me like, \u201cDid you know what I did then?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, I know everything,\u201d I said, \u201cbut keep mouth shut.\u201d He was very impressed. Ha-Ha-Had a gorgeous wife, Barbara. So, no -- nobody 1s perfect, but you cannot feel superior either, because you don\u2019t have the right to be. But if a person is suppressed, I fight for that person. And I don\u2019t have to ask anybody permission. If -- if you get hit on the -- on the street, I help. I go out, and -- and get myself the dirty, with blood, or whatever. You feel that it\u2019s necessary, unless someone else is stabbing you back, and say, \u201cShe killed him.\u201d Then I fight. Because that happens a lot in this country."

You get a swimming badge, you get this badge, you get that badge, oh, my arm was full of badges. So that 1s a kind of giving a bone to a dog that does a trick. That\u2019s the way I feel it. But the leader was very good in that, because she was, as a Red Cross person, aware that not everybody was capable. You -- you have people, they are not strong, you have people they are playing a coward, doesn\u2019t admit it. But that\u2019s the way they are.

We had no coffins any more, for instance. Coffins were out of the question, because there was no wood. So we wrapped dead body in a cloth or paper, and -- and then it was -- if you know. Yeah, in my ward were many, many who -- who died, and was very emotional, but what can you do, you know, you\u2019re not God."

But, because of his looks -- he looked younger than the age of a person that was sent to work in a German factory. He just -- I think he grew his ber -- beard, or whatever he did, in order to go to work without the second experience of being picked up. Because he -- he kept going to the office, to do his job, but he was not done being picked up again. Or maybe he got such a shock that he grow older, I don\u2019t know, but that -- that was happening in those days, so you didn\u2019t see man between 16, and I think it was either 45, or 55. So you saw only real old men, and men of my age, you -- you saw after the -- the dark fell in, and then you dared to go out, because I still dated somehow. And -- and of course, those boys on the hockey field, they dared to go out and play hockey, even they had the chance to go out to the factory in Germany. But, see y-you got bolder by the day. Do you think that you -- you -- you -- you thought that the -- the Germans could do all those things, yo-you just thought they were -- they were mentally sick and said those things, but you didn\u2019t obey them, you laughed in their face. Yeah, you can laugh now, but that\u2019s how I lost a lot of boyfriends. I remember I was in love with a -- with a guy, and he always tried to bring me home. And then all of a sudden, I went back to play hockey, and he was not there. So someone said yeah -- what was his name again? I forgot. But he was the guy that went via Belgium, and France, and the Pyrenee, and -- and Spain, to England, and then he got caught in -- in that time, but I have never found out how he got caught. That was just one of those news that you picked up, and you knew that was the guy that you liked so much. So it was -- 1t was very tragic. That\u2019s why it was difficult to have your emotions pointed at something, because it never lasted. And -- and you had no control about anything. If you tried to, you -- you had to change with a grudge, but so what, it changes, and there is nothing you can do about it. That is just the end of that period. So I think I grew faster for my age than any person here in the United States ever will, because of all the pain there, that you endured, and I was too strong to admit it.

But the government did not like the idea that we were living, so we had a notice of 14 days to scram, get out. And I was just married, so all my wedding presents I could not pack, was too many. You -- you only had the opportunity to pack what you could carry, so that was all behind, so they had a ball, perhaps with that stuff. The house was empty. We were just literally refugees. So then you come to the -- to the Netherlands, and you have no home, so you are supposed to live with your in-laws, and that -- I just explained my father-in-law was, with the Japs hanging -- oh, that was hell. So we tried as soon as we could manage, to immigrate. But, you stay on -- on -- on a list. You need to find your own sponsor, no help with that. So we kept looking in newspapers for immigration, and we found a sponsor. Then you need money in order to pay for the trip. We had that. I -- I -- I worked underground, too. I was not allowed to work, but I did.

So, if they were picked up, I think their uniforms were stripped off first, and they looked like a normal person again. That 1s what happened. So, if you meet a person, then you have no suspicion that -- that is not a Dutch person, but he might be a German. Because he doesn\u2019t talk, you don\u2019t know. Because Germans and -- and -- and -- and Dutch people look very much the same. You look Dutch too. No, really. I mean, that\u2019s the way it is. They\u2019re all blonde, and they have the same expressions, rosy cheeks, and even the way they walk is the same."

I hate that, you know, people complaining because the weather is lousy, or whatever. Don\u2019t complain. Go as a volunteer, and help there. That\u2019s my answer. And w -- that -- that is what I hope that the government finally will change, and do that, too, because there 1s a -- a need so badly, and -- and there is a need for -- for peace between those Arabs. I said to an Arab once, because I still talk with all -- all kinds of religions, \u201cWhy is it that- that women are treated so lousy in your country? They -- they have a veil, they cannot be seen.\u201d I said, \u201cIf I was in your country, the heck with you.

And then he was so -- so feeling bad, he drank, drank, drank, so he was loaded, he -- he -- he couldn\u2019t talk any more, so I remember I took him under the armpit, and like a sled, I got him outside the door, in the street, and then he woke up because of the cold. And the other boyfriend, the lieutenant, yelled at me, what are you doing with that bum? I said, \u201cWell, he needs fresh air.\u201d See, I -- I was the type, I didn\u2019t care less if he was a sergeant, or a private, or a lieutenant, because I\u2019m a baroness, I have a title.

She i -- she is from a famous Danish -- of course, we know all -- all -- like in England, who is duke, and who 1s lord, and whatever. My uncle was with the House of Lords, so y-you know you brought up in that, and you don't know any better. So, she was a baroness -- what\u2019s that again, and -- and she poked me. She said, \u201cDo you talk like that all the time?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the way I am.\u201d Because she was brought up very stiff, you know, don\u2019t talk, don\u2019t talk. But her husband was American. And so he said, \u201cYeah, I can understand.\u201d What -- whatever happens in the court is not always, you know. Well, they think it 1s, but it doesn\u2019t make sense. What\u2019s the point, you go to court, and renounce your own title? It\u2019s so stupid, because you cannot do anything with it. It doesn\u2019t cost any money. It doesn\u2019t hurt anybody. It\u2019s just a name."
