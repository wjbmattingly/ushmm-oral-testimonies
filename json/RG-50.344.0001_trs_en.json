And we knew that we probably would be discharged after we returned back home. We didn\u2122t know how soon that would be, because we had another chore to do.

Some of them were fortunate enough to have straw on their beds -- in their bunks. Just lying there, just with their wide eyes, because they were so emaciated. And they were suffering from many diseases and we were told we really couldn\u2122t touch them and they were not to touch us, because of all the diseases they had. And our main thing to do -- we couldn\u2122t give them a ny food, we started with sulfa drugs, sulfaphisol, because that was the antibiotic of that time. And when I tell you they had to take six or 10 pills at a time, it wasn\u2122t easy for them. And I remember several days later, after they removed the dead, you would see all the pills left in there, under the straw, in their beds that they just couldn\u2122t take."
