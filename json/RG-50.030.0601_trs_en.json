            "answer": "Well, there was my father and my mother and my older brothe r who was five years older. And then a stepbrother, Paul, who was much order, 17 years older, who really didn't live with us, but he was part of the family. And my father was much older than my mother. My father was 18 years older than my mother, and so he always seemed more like my grandfather to me. And my mother wa s 35 when I was born, so compared to how I felt at 35 or see other people being 35 now, she seemed much olde r, too. And we lived in an apartment right in the middle of the city. And so my father was a lawyer, an attorney, and he had his office -- I think we were on the fourth floor or sixth floor -- I'm not sure \u0152 of this building. And he had an office on the mezzanine of that same floor, so he would always come home for lunch at 1: 00 o'clock, around the time that I came home from school. And that was our main meal at that time. And in those days, children did not go out of the apartment by themselves. There was al ways somebody with me, a Fr\u00e4ulein type. And I was taken everywhere, to the park and ice skating. My father took me ice skating. And there was no such thing as really playing in the neighborhood on the street. But we did take summer vacations, le ngthy summer vacations to either a different part of Austria or to the beach in northern Italy. And so then I think we were able to play freely. But during the year, we were pretty constricted. My brothe r and I were not too close. The ideas in those days made a lot of difference. And he was an ardent boy scout and he thought all of my interests were silly and superficial. But whenever I was sick -- and I seemed to have been sick a good deal in those days with colds and flu and so forth - he would play games and especially chess with me. And I just recently picked it up again. So that's been fun. And so I went to elementary school. And I don't remember much about it except for a gym teacher who was very -- who looked more like a snowman or a snowwoman. She was built that way. And I never liked gym. So I think that was four grades or five grades. And then I went to another school, a private school. I believe it was a private school called Luithlen, L-U-I-T-H-L-E-N. And somehow, even though Jewish children were not allowed to go to school after awhile when Hitler came, I think I remained in school there somehow until I could leave."

                " So the schools that you attended, were they -- were there Jewish and non-Jewish children? ",
                " Yes. Definitely. Yes. Yeah. And then in this middle school we had religion classes, and they were done with release time. In other words, the Protestant children would go one place for instruction and the Catholic children to another and the Jewish children to another. And that's when I began to go to synagogue a little bit. My parents really didn't go. They would go to their parents or my father's parents in Czechoslovakia occasionally over the -- the Yom Kippur, over the holidays. But otherwise, no, there wasn't much celebration of holidays. And in fact, we had a Christmas tree for many years until I made my mother buy a menorah when I was old enough to go to synagogue. And then when I was a tween or an early teenager, we would go to children's services, the young people's services at the main synagogue in Vienn",
                " But I must have went -- I think I went mostly for the boys who also attended and then we could all go skating afterwards. So I didn't take a ll that very seriously at that time. My earliest memory of there being something wrong politically or worrying about what's going to happen to Jewish people was I think in 1934 when I remember going on vacation by car with my parents to a place called Bad Gastein, a resort-type thing. And we got there the evening, at night when it was dark. And the village was in the valley, and we came down from the mountain or hill or something. And all the windows in the town, in the village, were lit up and there were candles in the window. And apparently a chance llor from Austria, and his name was Dollfuss, had died. I don't know whether he died or was killed. But he was known to be very sympathetic to Hitler. And so it was eerie that he was so mourned or so celebrated. And I guess those lights are something I'll never forget. And also because my father was older he would always worry about whether he'd die before my mother and so forth. And he worried a great deal. My mother was a worrywart, too. And I've become a worrywart as well. And I married one. I married one, too. But my father was always worried about the times or money or clients or whatever. And he was very serious. He was quite an intellectual person. He was always reading. So there was really very little game playing in our house except occasionally my brother and I. And the only sport was ice skating. And then I went to gymnastic classes as a little girl next door. And swimming, I think. So somehow when Hitler came to Austria and was practically invited into Austria, somehow it wasn't a surprise because we had always lived with that kind of fear. So I don't know what else I can tell you. I had a few good friends, but the friends I had went to the same school, but they lived other places. So it wasn't like you could get together after school. You had to make a play date or something. A little older than a play date. And one friend, Francie, did come to New York and I did see her once or twice in New York. Oh, and anothe r friend, Eva Schiffer. She was a real intellectual. My father adored her. And she lived around th e corner. And my grades were always compared to hers. And I think she's a retired professor at Amherst or Andover now, and we are out of touch, although we were back in touch in New York . And then one friend went to South America, to Ar gentina, and we completely lost touch. And a boy I liked whet to Uruguay. So everybody was spread out. There was no cohesiveness. And I think even now I envy some of my friends who grew up in one town and had their high school crowd and go to reunions and all these memori es. So I don't have that. So I don't know what else should I tell you. "

And we had non-Jewish help, Fr\u00e4uleins and so forth, a housekeeper. But I didn't experience anything from them. And of course, they had to leave as soon as H itler came. Other people in my life, my gym teacher, my aunt was my piano teacher. And they were all Jewish. But we talked about it. And my father would talk about the things that Hitler did. And we would -- this is before concentration camps, but we were aw are of the Nuremburg laws and of what happens, and you know, and how you have to -- how you can't work any more and you can't have any non-Jewish help. My father ha d to get rid of his secretary. He had one secretary who was with him for 30 years or something. But personally, I can't say I experienced it. My main experience was years later when I visited Vienna the first time, I think, in '69. Do you want to hear that story? Yeah?"

And so we were seated with this man who was a bit older than I am, maybe 10, 15 years older than I was at the time. Started talking somehow. And I spoke a little broken German. And he said, \"Oh, how come your German is so good?\" or something. And I said, \"Well, I'm glad you think it's good.\" I sa id, \"I used to live here.\" And he said, \"Oh?\" And I said, \"Well, I left in 1939. I had to leave when Hitler came to Austri",
                "\" And so he said, \"Oh,\" and then he fell silent. Oh, and he had been some kind of movie producer or something. Anyway, he became silent and fi ve minutes later he got up. And it felt very chilly. The Austrians were never overly friendly, and they were more Nazis than the Germans were, I think. So again, it was not surprising, but at the same time it was extremely uncomfortable. And just such a tiny little incident th at I'll never forget. So I think if I had experienced more incidents and more graphic incidents, I would have remembered. But I just did not happen to be with people. "

And then real fear settled in because we then -- well, it was after Kristallnacht. And I guess I heard about Kristallnacht later. I didn't see any of those terrible things happening on the street. But then we began to be really afraid. The person in power was the superintendent of the apartment building. And it was a question of whether he was going to be our friend or foe. And everything depended on him. And so I think we were all in fear that he would say yes, such and such, the Grosses living there, Jewish, and go take them. But fortunately that never happened.

And he married a Jewi sh woman, one whose sister and brother-inlaw actually emigrated to Palestine, to Israel then. But they left. His biological mother was related to a very prominent Czech shoe manufacturer.

People say when you get old your long-term memory is ve ry good, but for me my short- or my long-term isn't very good. And so I remember that anxiety and those guards walking through and being very relieved afterwards. And so then we got to the Hague of Holland and got onto their boat, ship.

And my father was too old to take the law exam. So I'm not sure. I think there was some help for refugees. I think they lived on that and my mother's earnings. Not much."

I remember my foster mother saying, when I was about 16, she said -- she asked me whether I wouldn't want to convert. And I said -- she said, \"Because then you wouldn't have any trouble and then all your problems were because you were Jewish. If there weren't any Jewish people, there wouldn't be any problems.\" It was something naive like that. It wasn't anti Semitic. It was naive, I think. And I was very hurt and angry about that. And I remember that being the first and, I think, the only time I must admit that I fasted on Yom Kippur, just to prove that I wa s Jewish. Not that they ever knew about it or cared, but I felt better for doing that. And I think I had to prove to myself. But basically it was that I think they had led a rather insulated life and didn't understand."

And since my foster mother made me take typing and shorthand, when I graduated high school, I got a job, a secretarial job there. And I made quite a few friends. And when those gu ys left to go to London to go to the Grosvenor House, I went with. And I more or less said good-bye to them at that time. And that was probably in the spring of '44. I think I was in London maybe six months. I got an apartment. So I said good-bye at that time. And then my husband and I went back one time many years later. And my foster fa ther had died. And she was living in a nursing home and had pretty advanced Alzhei mer's so that she didn't recognize me. But she eventually did. My husband, he wa s very good with her, and he was able to somehow refresh her memory. Either that or she pretended. And also when I came to this country, one of the first things I did was he r daughter and husband lived in Alexandria here. And I went down to see them and meet them, and we corresponded.

And they were friends of my parents. And so when he heard that I was coming he said he would get me a job. And he immediately got me a s ecretarial job at this company on 6th Avenue, Rockefeller Cent er. And he said, \"Well, of course you'll go to college. \"Because there had never been any talk of -- when you graduate high school 16 and there is no money, you don't talk about going to college. I don't think I ever thought further than a day ahead of what I was going to do or what I was goi ng to be or anything. It was all survival. So he got me this job and he said, \"Of course you'll go to college.\" I said, \"Oh, I will?\" And he referred me to the Office for International Education. And I could have one of two scholarships, one to the University of Miami in Ohio and one at the University of Michigan. Somehow I picked the University of Michigan and had a roomand-board scholarship at a Jewish sorority and an academic scholarship. So a year later I -- oh, and I had to take a couple of courses to catch up in American history, which of course I needed, and intermediate algebra, of which I was very weak. And so I came to Ann Arbor. The person I admired most there is my mother, that she was able to let me go again and said she wanted to do this, that she wanted me to do this. Because I think if she had been, \"Oh, poor me, you're leaving me\" kind of thing, I pr obably wouldn't have gone. So that was good. And so that was another adjustment. It's been one after the other. And then I had this room-and-board scholarship at this Jewish sorority. So I was not a member, not that I ever wanted to be in a so rority. But nevertheless, I had a room of my own. And I made a couple of go od friends there. But nevertheless, I was, again, on the outside, even though everybody was Jewish."

I don't know how I knew this, but I did know. And the adviser had said -- at that time, they didn't have an undergraduate social work school, which they do now. And so I said I want ed to major in sociology. And he said the sociology depart ment is so bad, don't do that. Major in English. So what did I know? So I majored in English lit. And eventually much later I went back to graduate school and did what I really wanted to. So I met him. And he graduated a year before I did. And he was from Flint, Michigan . It's a good town to be from. And so we got married during my last year of school and we had an apartment in Ann Arbor. He would kind of commute back and forth. And then I moved to Flint, which I didn't want to do. Originally he said we would live in De nver because he had such a good time there in the Army. But then when he was home for that year, his parents had a bakery and his name was well-known. He realized that it was much easier to be in your own practice when your name is known as not. And so we st ayed there. And that was a very different family. It was an eastern Polish family, and they spoke Yiddish. They weren't Polish, but they were from there. They were first-generation, his parents were. And for them, I wasn't Jewish enough, for my mother-in-law. I wasn't Jewish enough. I didn't have enough money -- or any money. But we got over that hump. My father-in-law was a very nice man. My mother-in-law was a very ni ce woman, too, but very determined. So anyway, it was a good town to raise our kids."
