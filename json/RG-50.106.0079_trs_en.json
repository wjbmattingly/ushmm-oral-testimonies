            "answer": "Oh, my mother, you know, came up to comfort me and my grandfather ran out to comfort me. And what was interesting was, in 1983, when we visited the home for the first time, the people are \u0152 who are living in there are descendants from my grandfather\u2122s apprentice. And, it was the son of the apprentice who was running the store then and shortly now \u0152 s hortly, he \u0152 he had, before we came, he had turned the business over to his son, w ho unfortunately though, had a heart attack and died very rec \u0152 just recently, shortly before we came. But back in 1983, when we came in, the Interview with Kurt Pauly November 18 , 1997 8appre \u0152 th-the \u0152 my father \u0152 grandfather\u2122s apprentice was still alive. He was an o \u0152 very old man, but unfortunately his memory was gone. But the \u0152 his \u0152 his son still remembered my grandfather. And he remembered that my grandfather, after we had left, my \u0152 the people, the older people \u0152 I don\u2122t remember exac tly when, but some time shortly after we left, they were \u0152 the Jewish people were sent to what was then the Jewish old age home in Aachen. They were all collected, and they were c \u0152 there. And he says he can remember my grandfather coming to the house because they didn\u2122t get ve \u0152 enough food to eat. He would come to the house there and ask them if he could eat with them, becaus e they were not getting enough food. And that was pros \u0152 as I recall was about 1940 - \u212241. And then after awhile, this man said, your grandfather just didn\u2122t come any more, so we didn\u2122t know what happened, except they had heard that the Jews had been taken away. And as it turned out, the records now show that they\u2122d been taken to Theresienstadt. I also can remember going to school shortly be fore we left. The school year in \u0152 in Germany starts right after Easter. And we left Germany in early summer. So I had to go to school briefly, and I can rememb er that my father was concerned about me and my going to school. I had to take a tram to get to school. And he rode behind the tram on a bicycle every day to just observe that nothing would occur. And then would meet the tram sometime on the way back, when I came back from school.

So that \u0152 it just worked out that way because when we went \u0152 the agents \u0152 had we not been able to adopt through the agency, we probably would have tried some other means, but it all worked out very well. So \u0152 and \u0152 so th en after we adopted my daughter \u0152 well, first of all, the agency required that you have a separate room for each of the children, that was one of the conditions. We only had a thr \u0152 two bedroom apartment, and my son was already in the second bedroom. So we \u0152 we told the agency we would get a sec \u0152 a third \u0152 another bedroom for the \u0152 for \u0152 for my daughter eventually, so we looked for a house. So on \u0152 on the condition that we would, you know, provide a second bedroom for the \u0152 my daughter, they placed my daughter with us on \u0152 she was still in the \u0152 we were still in the apartment.

So we \u0152 in the \u0152 in the meantime, she had moved out of her \u0152 th e apartment in the house that we lived in, and taken an apartment in a \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 in a building that was built for senior citizen resident, as a senior citizen residence. She was very happy there. It was not too far from us. But while she was there she began to develop signs of dementia. And at the suggestion of her doctors and based on our own observations we decided that she probably should go into a \u0152 some kind of a home. And after looking around very long and hard, we found a place in upstate New York, in New Rochelle . There was a very good Jewish philanthropic home there, which is still there. And we decided of all the places we saw, this was the most approp \u0152 the best and most appropriate, and they accepted my mother. And this was in 1974, and two \u0152 oh, maybe two weeks after they had accepted my mother, the company said oh, by the way, we\u2122re moving the headquarters to Bethesda, Maryland . Now we knew that Interview with Kurt Pauly November 18 , 1997 46they were considering moving, but it \u0152 but the actual knowledge that the move was going to take place occurred just as my mother had been accepted in this home. So we said, well, can\u2122t put my mother there, we\u2122ll have to try to place her down here. We decided to move down here, that was [indecipherable] company [indecipherable] . As it turned out, we couldn\u2122t place my mother in a home here. We tried some alternatives for her, but it did not work out and we went back to the home in New Rochelle and said, would they accept my mother? We couldn\u2122t place her in the Hebrew home here. They had \u0152 they wouldn\u2122t accept her, they didn\u2122t have the facilities, she was an out-of-stater, so forth and so on.

We decided to do that and sh e lived there for about four years before she died. And we went up there roughly al most once a month. One of us would go, either I would go or Jill would go, on a \u0152 usually on a Sunday to see my mother. And of course, her condition deteriorated, so after awhile she really didn\u2122t even Interview with Kurt Pauly November 18 , 1997 47know us any more, which is typical for that condition. But \u0152 so we took someone to help, we hired someone to help, you know, take \u0152 supplement the care that she was getting in the home.

She was one of the people [indecipherable] sort of a distant member of the family, that came when \u0152 during her illness, and she spent some time with her. But we never quite knew what the relationship was, so we mentioned it to them and subs equently they deg \u0152 dug in to the genealogy and they found out what the connection was, that Annie Frank and I had the same greatgreat-grandparents on her father\u2122s side, which was, you know, her mother\u2122s \u0152 well, Interview with Kurt Pauly November 18 , 1997 65her mother\u2122s side.

So they were interested to hear from us about our experiences. And we did it on a sort of a question and answer basis, rather than just sort of lecture to the students. We s \u0152 we did it on the basis of answering their questions, which wy \u0152 th-the \u0152 the ch ildren got very much involved, we were really surprised at how involved the children got in this question and answer period. They really seemed to show considerable interest in what happened, and \u0152 but wa \u0152 what it meant to be Jewish and what \u0152 a little bit about the Jewish religion, and what had happened to the Jews in Germany during the period of \u0152 of the Nazi regime."

He\u2122s an engineer, he speaks English very well, comes to this country frequently on busine ss. And we\u2122ve been running this through him.

On one side, of course, it\u2122s very sad and not happy to go to a place where those thing that we know happened, and some of them which we experienced ourselves happened, that \u0152 so that\u2122s the sad side of it. On the other hand, it was good to see where our families lived, and also to meet people who showed some sincere interest and understanding of what occurred, and really wanted to know what happened, and what our feelings were. Now obviously the people we me t in these circumstances, are people who have \u0152 well we \u0152 shall we say a positive attitude toward what occurred in the Holocaust. I mean \u0152 so in the \u0152 in the sense that they know what happened, and feel that they want to try to make good in some sense, to the limited extent that they can, the terrible \u0152 make goods \u0152 you know, the \u0152 it\u2122s \u0152 from the terrible things that occurred. So it\u2122s very good to meet those kind of people now. Obviously we know that there\u2122s still anti-Semitism in Germany, and that there are still people running around in Germany who were perhaps di rectly involved in some of the atrocities that occurred in the Holocaust. So, you know, and so that gives you kind of a terrible feeling when you\u2122re just walking down the street and you see someone of an age that you know went through the period as an adult; period of the Holocaust, period from \u212233 through \u212245; and you wonder, you know, Interview with Kurt Pauly November 18 , 1997 72you have this \u0152 this \u0152 this nagging feeling about, you know, who are these people? You know, were they perpetrator, were they di \u0152 were they directly involved? And that\u2122s a very, very difficult emotion to deal with. But on the other hand, I guess it\u2122s \u0152 in a way it\u2122s a good thing to face up to th at, and to know that both of these sides of Germany still exist, and the hope we have is for this younger gener \u0152 these younger generation to really understand and that \u0152 what happened, and therefor try to make sure it doesn\u2122t happen again."

I mean, my father was a soldier in the first World War. And the Jews of Germany were as patriotic Germans as the Jews of America are patriotic Americans. I mean, they felt German.

That was an interesting experience once I had in the museum when I was at the elevators. A young group came \u0152 some young people came through, oh, young teenagers, maybe again, 12, 13.
