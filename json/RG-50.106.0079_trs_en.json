They were all collected, and they were c \u2014 there. And he says he can remember my grandfather coming to the house because they didn\u2019t get ve \u2014 enough food to eat. He would come to the house there and ask them if he could eat with them, because they were not getting enough food. And that was pros \u2014 as I recall was about 1940 - \u201941. And then after awhile, this man said, your grandfather just didn\u2019t come any more, so we didn\u2019t know what happened, except they had heard that the Jews had been taken away. And as it turned out, the records now show that they\u2019d been taken to Theresienstadt. I also can remember going to school shortly before we left. The school year in \u2014 in Germany starts right after Easter. And we left Germany in early summer. So I had to go to school briefly, and I can remember that my father was concerned about me and my going to school. I had to take a tram to get to school. And he rode behind the tram on a bicycle every day to just observe that nothing would occur. And then would meet the tram sometime on the way back, when I came back from school.

But basically they\u2019re a historical society, that\u2019s what they\u2019re interested in, they\u2019re interested in the history of \u2014 of this part of Aachen, Eilendorf, that they \u2014 their family \u2014 where they live, and where their families have lived for generations as well.

But they were very interested in what had happened to these \u2014 their former \u2014 the former residents, the Jewish residents of this little town of Eilendorf, which was now incorporated into Aachen, cause the \u2014 so they had done all this genealogical research on my mother\u2019s family. And one other interesting aspect, by the way of that, I just mention in passing; my mother had always said that she was related to Annie Frank\u2019s family, and we never quite knew how. So we had mentioned this to them. And the facts \u2014 my mother told the story that when Annie Frank\u2019s grandmother, maternal grandmother and \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, yes \u2014 of \u2014 paternal grandmother, was very ill. She was one of the people [indecipherable] sort of a distant member of the family, that came when \u2014 during her illness, and she spent some time with her. But we never quite knew what the relationship was, so we mentioned it to them and subsequently they deg \u2014 dug into the genealogy and they found out what the connection was, that Annie Frank and I had the same great- great-grandparents on her father\u2019s side, which was, you know, her mother\u2019s \u2014 well, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So it\u2019s very good to meet those kind of people now. Obviously we know that there\u2019s still anti-Semitism in Germany, and that there are still people running around in Germany who were perhaps directly involved in some of the atrocities that occurred in the Holocaust.

But I do think we are also \u2014 but we \u2014 I think we\u2019re somehow different emotionally than people who haven\u2019t had any \u2014 the experience even we\u2019ve had."

I th \u2014 don\u2019t kn \u2014 you know, there\u2019ve been \u2014 there\u2019s been a lot written about people who were in Europe and \u2014 and survived the Holocaust in Europe, or \u2014 and what happened to them, people who were in the camps, or hidden, or so forth. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been much written about people who got out of Europe, but had the experiences that our parents had, and what \u2014 what that meant for them, because here were people who were just, you know, ripped out of their environment, and ripped out of everything that they were used to, and were thrown into another world, other countries, and had to adjust, you know, to \u2014 try to establish a whole new life for themselves. Now, obviously their experiences were not as horrible as the people who were involved in the camps, but they certainly, I know, are \u2014 both of our families suffered a great deal as a result of that as well. It\u2019s a different kind of suffering and it\u2019s a different kind of experience."

            "answer": "Yeah. Now, their children, again, now they\u2019re gonna be another \u2014 further removed from it, and now it really becomes ancient history, in a way. And that\u2019s why I think the museum is very important, because it brings that history to these people, to these young people, and to the people who had no experience with the Holocaust, and says oh hey, wait a minute, here it is, and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s more immediate than just reading about it, or hearing about it, sort of on the background noise, and hopefully it brings it up as a more \u2014 as a \u2014 as a more real experience, that it really did happen, and it happened fairly recently, and it happened to people that are still alive today. That was an interesting experience once I had in the museum when I was at the elevators. A young group came \u2014 some young people came through, oh, young teenagers, maybe again, 12, 13. And one of the boys came up to me while we were waiting \u2014 while they were waiting for the elevator, and he says, is th \u2014 is there anybody still alive who \u2014 who experienced this? So to him this was already, you know, really, you know, ancient history. So what I told him I had \u2014 had an exper \u2014 you know, that I had lived through that, I guess it was sort of like, you know, meeting Julius Caesar or something, I don\u2019t know. But \u2014 so that \u2014 our whole experience wa \u2014 you know. Now, we don\u2019t want to make the Holocaust, you know, sort of a religion of life now because I think that\u2019s a ne \u2014 that\u2019s very negative.
