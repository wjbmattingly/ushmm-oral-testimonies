And what was interesting was, in 1983, when we visited the home for the first time, the people are \u2014 who are living in there are descendants from my grandfather\u2019s apprentice. And, it was the son of the apprentice who was running the store then and shortly now \u2014 shortly, he \u2014 he had, before we came, he had turned the business over to his son, who unfortunately though, had a heart attack and died very rec \u2014 just recently, shortly before we came. But back in 1983, when we came in, the Interview with Kurt Pauly \u00b0 November 18, 1997 appre \u2014 th-the \u2014 my father \u2014 grandfather\u2019s apprentice was still alive. He was an 0 \u2014 very old man, but unfortunately his memory was gone. But the \u2014 his \u2014 his son still remembered my grandfather. And he remembered that my grandfather, after we had left, my \u2014 the people, the older people \u2014 I don\u2019t remember exactly when, but some time shortly after we left, they were \u2014 the Jewish people were sent to what was then the Jewish old age home in Aachen. They were all collected, and they were c \u2014 there. And he says he can remember my grandfather coming to the house because they didn\u2019t get ve \u2014 enough food to eat. He would come to the house there and ask them if he could eat with them, because they were not getting enough food. And that was pros \u2014 as I recall was about 1940 - \u201941. And then after awhile, this man said, your grandfather just didn\u2019t come any more, so we didn\u2019t know what happened, except they had heard that the Jews had been taken away. And as it turned out, the records now show that they\u2019d been taken to Theresienstadt. I also can remember going to school shortly before we left. The school year in \u2014 in Germany starts right after Easter. And we left Germany in early summer. So I had to go to school briefly, and I can remember that my father was concerned about me and my going to school. I had to take a tram to get to school. And he rode behind the tram on a bicycle every day to just observe that nothing would occur. And then would meet the tram sometime on the way back, when I came back from school.

So that \u2014 it just worked out that way because when we went \u2014 the agents \u2014 had we not been able to adopt through the agency, we probably would have tried some other means, but it all worked out very well. So \u2014 and \u2014 so then after we adopted my daughter \u2014 well, first of all, the agency required that you have a separate room for each of the children, that was one of the conditions. We only had a thr \u2014 two bedroom apartment, and my son was already in the second bedroom. So we \u2014 we told the agency we would get a sec \u2014 a third \u2014 another bedroom for the \u2014 for \u2014 for my daughter eventually, so we looked for a house. So on \u2014 on the condition that we would, you know, provide a second bedroom for the \u2014 my daughter, they placed my daughter with us on \u2014 she was still in the \u2014 we were still in the apartment. But what we did was we made a room out of a dinette area, temporarily, for my daughter. And somewhere after that we \u2014 we did move into a house, and then we had a bedroom for each child. And meanwhile I was working, and I worked for five years for a public accounting firm, Touche, and \u2014 whose name changed several times while I was working for them. But by th \u2014 when I left they were called Touche Interview with Kurt Pauly * November 18, 1997 Ross.

So we \u2014 1n the \u2014 in the meantime, she had moved out of her \u2014 the apartment in the house that we lived in, and taken an apartment in a \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in a building that was built for senior citizen resident, as a senior citizen residence. She was very happy there. It was not too far from us. But while she was there she began to develop signs of dementia. And at the suggestion of her doctors and based on our own observations we decided that she probably should go into a \u2014 some kind of a home. And after looking around very long and hard, we found a place in upstate New York, in New Rochelle. There was a very good Jewish philanthropic home there, which is still there. And we decided of all the places we saw, this was the most approp \u2014 the best and most appropriate, and they accepted my mother. And this was in 1974, and two \u2014 oh, maybe two weeks after they had accepted my mother, the company said oh, by the way, we\u2019re moving the headquarters to Bethesda, Maryland. Now we knew that Interview with Kurt Pauly \u201c\u00b0 November 18, 1997 they were considering moving, but it \u2014 but the actual knowledge that the move was going to take place occurred just as my mother had been accepted in this home. So we said, well, can\u2019t put my mother there, we\u2019ll have to try to place her down here. We decided to move down here, that was [indecipherable] company [indecipherable]. As it turned out, we couldn\u2019t place my mother in a home here. We tried some alternatives for her, but it did not work out and we went back to the home in New Rochelle and said, would they accept my mother? We couldn\u2019t place her in the Hebrew home here. They had \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t accept her, they didn\u2019t have the facilities, she was an out-of-stater, so forth and so on. And they said well, if she\u2019s in no worse condition that she was when we accepted her, we\u2019ll take her. And of course, she was in worse condition.

I fl\u2014 we flew \u2014 I flew up with her, and she had a great day, and they said fine, she\u2019s no worse than she was then, and they took her in.

We decided to do that and she lived there for about four years before she died. And we went up there roughly almost once a month. One of us would go, either I would go or Jill would go, on a \u2014 usually on a Sunday to see my mother. And of course, her condition deteriorated, so after awhile she really didn\u2019t even Interview with Kurt Pauly \" November 18, 1997 know us any more, which 1s typical for that condition. But \u2014 so we took someone to help, we hired someone to help, you know, take \u2014 supplement the care that she was getting in the home.

Just a few months ago I had a very interesting experience. A woman came in who spoke \u2014 didn\u2019t speak too much English, she was German, a German teacher. And so she had come up to one of the other volunteers who knew that I spoke German, so she brought this woman over. So we spoke, and she said she was a teacher and she was here on some conference and she wanted to see the Holocaust Museum. And afterwards, she came up to me and she s \u2014 was very emotional about what she had seen. And she said now, she said, I\u2019m really happy that I\u2019ve seen this, because now no one in Germany can tell me that they didn\u2019t know what was going on during the war. She said, and I have to pass this along to my grandchildren and my children. She said, I want them to know, make sure that they know what happened. So occasionally you get those kind of reactions. Or people who are just Interview with Kurt Pauly \u201d November 18, 1997 very emotional about what they\u2019ve seen for some reason. Either just because the whole exhibit is that way, or they\u2019ve had some experience in their lives that attaches them to the Holocaust in some way.

And they had arranged for us to meet this group. I call them the \u2014 call them the historical society, but their actual name would \u2014 closer is the Heimatverein, which sort of a \u2014 a home \u2014 a hometown club. But basically they\u2019re a historical society, that\u2019s what they\u2019re interested in, they\u2019re interested in the history of \u2014 of this part of Aachen, Eilendorf, that they \u2014 their family \u2014 where they live, and where their families have lived for generations as well. And when we came they wanted us to \u2014 to meet with them, and to tell us what they knew about the Jews that had lived in Eilendorf, and Interview with Kurt Pauly \u201c November 18, 1997 also to see what \u2014 what our experiences had been after we left. So they \u2014 so we not only got the usual tours, but we actually met with people, including my former ne \u2014 nanny, and some other people who had lived there for \u2014 during the time when my parents were still there, although most of the people were much too young to have been anything but children, or even some of them were, of course, obviously not even born til after the war. But they were very interested in what had happened to these \u2014 their former \u2014 the former residents, the Jewish residents of this little town of Eilendorf, which was now incorporated into Aachen, cause the \u2014 so they had done all this genealogical research on my mother\u2019s family. And one other interesting aspect, by the way of that, I just mention in passing; my mother had always said that she was related to Annie Frank\u2019s family, and we never quite knew how. So we had mentioned this to them. And the facts \u2014 my mother told the story that when Annie Frank\u2019s grandmother, maternal grandmother and \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, yes \u2014 of \u2014 paternal grandmother, was very ill. She was one of the people [indecipherable] sort of a distant member of the family, that came when \u2014 during her illness, and she spent some time with her. But we never quite knew what the relationship was, so we mentioned it to them and subsequently they deg \u2014 dug into the genealogy and they found out what the connection was, that Annie Frank and I had the same great- great-grandparents on her father\u2019s side, which was, you know, her mother\u2019s \u2014 well, Interview with Kurt Pauly \u00b0\u00b0 November 18, 1997 her mother\u2019s side. I\u2019m sorry, not her father\u2019s side, her mother\u2019s side. So we had the same great-great-grandparents, that\u2019s where the relationship came in. Which was very interesting to hear. And my mother always said that I had played with her and her sister at some time, but I don\u2019t have any memories of that."

But it was \u2014 it \u2014 it was a sort of bittersweet thing. Obviously, it was wonderful seeing her again, and hearing her stories. On the other hand, some of the things sh-she told us, were very unhappy things, about, you know, what my \u2014 what had began \u2014 sort of experiences my parents had [phone ringing] after the Nazis came in and \u2014 and the time we were leaving, and what she knew about the family, what had happened to my cousins and so forth.

All these people are buried there, at Interview with Kurt Pauly \"\u00b0 November 18, 1997 this little cemetery in Eilendorf, and it\u2019s still there, those stones are still standing. So that was a bit of a \u2014 a \u2014 that sort of gives you an \u2014 at a time now, you know, you ve heard these stories, but to actually see it, actually see where these people are buried, and to see that, give you a sort of a more immediate \u2014 more immediacy to \u2014 to all the things that you heard. It gives it a mo \u2014 a newer reality, so to speak. It was interesting, we also \u2014 we also spoke there to one of the school groups there, they had asked us to do \u2014 whether we would do that, speak to a group of children. That occurred both in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in Cologne when my wife went back there last year, and this year when we were in Aachen.

On one side, of course, it\u2019s very sad and not happy to go to a place where those thing that we know happened, and some of them which we experienced ourselves happened, that \u2014 so that\u2019s the sad side of it. On the other hand, it was good to see where our families lived, and also to meet people who showed some sincere interest and understanding of what occurred, and really wanted to know what happened, and what our feelings were. Now obviously the people we met in these circumstances, are people who have \u2014 well we \u2014 shall we say a positive attitude toward what occurred in the Holocaust. I mean \u2014 so in the \u2014 in the sense that they know what happened, and feel that they want to try to make good in some sense, to the limited extent that they can, the terrible \u2014 make goods \u2014 you know, the \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 from the terrible things that occurred. So it\u2019s very good to meet those kind of people now. Obviously we know that there\u2019s still anti-Semitism in Germany, and that there are still people running around in Germany who were perhaps directly involved in some of the atrocities that occurred in the Holocaust. So, you know, and so that gives you kind of a terrible feeling when you\u2019re just walking down the street and you see someone of an age that you know went through the period as an adult; period of the Holocaust, period from \u201933 through \u00b045; and you wonder, you know, Interview with Kurt Pauly \" November 18, 1997 you have this \u2014 this \u2014 this nagging feeling about, you know, who are these people? You know, were they perpetrator, were they di \u2014 were they directly involved? And that\u2019s a very, very difficult emotion to deal with. But on the other hand, I guess it\u2019s \u2014 ina way it\u2019s a good thing to face up to that, and to know that both of these sides of Germany still exist, and the hope we have 1s for this younger gener \u2014 these younger generation to really understand and that \u2014 what happened, and therefor try to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again."

I just \u2014 you ju \u2014 they \u2014 I mean, I guess you can never quite feel as certain about what\u2019s going to happen, and that it\u2019ll be that \u2014 or that something like that occurred in the Holocaust can\u2019t happen again, or can\u2019t happen to Jews again, or can\u2019t happen in this country again, as people who didn\u2019t have that experience.

That was an interesting experience once I had in the museum when I was at the elevators. A young group came \u2014 some young people came through, oh, young teenagers, maybe again, 12, 13.
