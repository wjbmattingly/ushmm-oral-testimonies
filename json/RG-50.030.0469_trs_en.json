Even I liked him like [indecipherable] boy, and so -- so I went once in his room, and I saw there a letter lying on the table, I was looking at it. And there was a little picture, little picture of a girl, and it was signed like, eira Dieter, e1ra Dieter, yeah. I didn\u2019t ask anybody. I always had the nature not to ask, I don\u2019t ask people anything. When they s -- you say something to me, you say [indecipherable]. So I was -- and I remembered this name Dieter, yes, and I knew that was from Bratislava, because he went, this cousin, to visit. That\u2019s it. And went to [indecipherable] in the lager, and there -- you see, when people cannot fight enemies, yeah, Americans with the Canadians, with Mexicans and so they turn against groups, yeah. So was in lager also. The first day, the girls started. Oh you western girls, be ashamed, all you eastern girls, yes. I was from west Slovakia, or east Slovakia -- my direction is always [indecipherable] -- east Slovakia, Bratislava was from west Slovakia. So -- and once, in 1942, we were in Birkenau right aw -- right away, yes, was maybe in -- in -- no, I don\u2019t ri -- in winter after we came there. We were standing the whole Sunday outside, was cold, very cold. We are standing there. And that time I think we didn\u2019t have more these uniforms, we were somehow in civil dresses, and we had the line. [indecipherable]. There was a group of girls and they played around and talked and so, and they were from the other part of Slovakia, and they asked me where I am from. I said from this part of slo -- said, oh, you are the same like we are. You are -- you don\u2019t belong there [indecipherable]. I was very honored, yes. Bigger group. So and there was a girl and they played around with her joking, and said -- oh, somebody said, oh my Dieter. Dieter, yeah. And I ask her, \u2018Are you Dieter Rishter?\u201d She said, \u201cYes, I am Dieter Rishter.\u201d So -- because he told me her name is Dieter Rishter. So I said, my uncle is whoever. She said, oh, I remember him very well. And then I stayed with them, and she said, come with me, come with me, we will be together. Because we could move our bunks, yes, and in this barrack where we were, there were beds, everybody had one bed, not this bunk. [indecipherable]. But two -- two girls slept together because these beds were -- come, come with me, we will be together. She has a -- she had the older sister there. So then I stayed with her, and we became very, very good friends. We worked together, we were in the same commando and we were together. But she became sick. And when we had our biggest, biggest selection, 1943, so she had swollen legs. We were sitting in the sauna the whole night on benches and so, so she had up her legs and I was massaging her legs, she was very, very sick. I took care of her. And then in the -- the whole night we were sitting there in the sauna, and during the morning we had to line up, and it was a selection, and that was the biggest, biggest selection, because always when the lager was full, 1t wasn\u2019t place where to sleep, then they made the selection. Between that time we went back to the other barrack, we had- we slept on these bunks and so -- and so it was a big selection, very big, first they took one, then five left, and so on and so on and so. So I asked myself someday, how come that they never selected me, that they never pointed on me. So I came to the conclusion, maybe it\u2019s true, because I never looked at them. [indecipherable] like this. I was straight, and I never looked up there. I says, and maybe they pointed and I didn\u2019t see. But I think [indecipherable] maybe [indecipherable]. Anyhow, so I put Dieter in front of me, Dieter do -- she spoke German, you go in front of me, and I will follow you on the selection, because I was so sure that I will make it, that time. So she pointed like that, and she went, and I was praying, oh my God, help me, Dieter should pass by. [indecipherable]. So -- and she went, she passed. They didn\u2019t take her to the gas chamber, she passed by. I was so happy, thanks God. Dieter went through sick. And then we had to line up again and then they send us to barracks, to different barracks, here, here, we stopped, SO, SO, So -- So I lost her, no. She went somewhere else. And the next day in the morning, I don\u2019t remember if we didn\u2019t go to work or so, or maybe early morning, I went from one barrack to the other one to call her name. Dieter Rishter, Dieter Rishter. No answer. So I went to the next barrack, and to next barrack. And somebody said, \u201cDieter Rishter died.\u201d She survived the selection, but she died, sick and exhausted. So what happened? She went down from the [indecipherable] from the bank [indecipherable] she had to go down. She went down, she fell down. And she wasn\u2019t [indecipherable] they took her to the -- through to -- to the other [indecipherable] and I lost Dieter. I cannot still forget her, such a nice girl. So -- and before -- excuse me -- before her, her sister died, before her, you know."

She said, don\u2019t bother with them, because it could happen that they will take you also with them. So we were standing, looking at them, and didn\u2019t say even anything. It was very sad, very sad to see so many people. And they had to leave their belongings, they had to leave the families because the SS said line up, line up. They were their prisoners also in these uniforms. They had to help with the belongings, their suitcases. But they ran all over among them, among the newcomers and they said -- they suggested, mothers with children, give over the children to the grandmothers. Men, you say that you are younger. Boys, when you are told, you say that you are older. When they ask you about your profession, you say that you have a trade in -- not in German I don\u2019t know [indecipherable] they could understand each other. And the SS, they yelled los, los, and line up. So suddenly in five minutes they didn\u2019t have their belongings, they didn\u2019t have their families. Some mothers, they give over to their grandmothers, some kept them. They had to line up again, men to me -- with men, women with women. Women- mothers hold the children, and then came the doctor, and selected with one finger. He didn\u2019t bother too much, he didn\u2019t think too much. And so they came with a little wand, they took the sick ones first, yes, and then they took them. They didn\u2019t know what happened to them. It was so sudden that they didn\u2019t know what happened to them. And they were carried away. And some of them then came to the lager, but not right away, not right away, they took them some [indecipherable] place and then they came into. And in a short time you saw the flames. So that 5 was very often a st -- we were so close, the crematory wasn\u2019t far from the entrance. So often was there a strong smell of burned flesh and burned bones, very often, more often than not, from the burning people. Was very sad. They came, they came, it was time and they came and came. Never stopped. Was time and for weeks nobody came, maybe for a month, I don\u2019t know, don\u2019t remember. It was really when the Hungarian came, very often."
