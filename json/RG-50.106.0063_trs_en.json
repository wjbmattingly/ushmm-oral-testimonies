            "answer": "No. My parents are not French. My mother came from Siberia -- she was born in Siberia, lived in China; came in France in 1918 or \u212220 to study medi cine in Paris. My father was born in Chernivtsi, which was Ro mania, used to be Austria and he spoke German as his first language. He came to Pa ris also to study medicine and they met in medical school, and got married, and they came in the village, where I was born, in 1935. Interview with Arlette de Long 4 They chose -- they chose that village becau se once they graduated from medical school, they had no money between them selves at all. So, they se arched for a place that would have no physicians, and I don\u2122t know why it was in the north, exactly what was the process, but they found this village in which there were no doctors within about 30 kilometers, or just -- or maybe less than that, 15. So, they rented a house, settled down, and never told anybody that they were Jews. It was 1935 and they must -- they -- they had a good feeling for what was happening, they were really -- had much forethought, and in fact I think this is what saved our lives, because even though in the village I\u2122m sure people knew we were Jewish, because we were this foreign family; Waldmann was the name, Waldmann (vald-man), however they spok e with an accent. My grandparents had come from China to live with us in 1937. So, we suddenly were a very odd family in that village. There were no Jews at all anyplace in this area. But the fact that he was never officially announced that -- when I was a child -- when I was born on -- I have papers. I don\u2122t know if it happened in that (?sho-let-ry?) or not, but I have papers that I\u2122ve been baptised. I think the only person who knew the truth was the priest in the village, who did not speak. No one spoke. No -- no one told the Germans that we were Jews, or no one made a concerted effort to get us out."

They died -- his father died during the war, and his mother just a month after I was born, and my father never, never, never Interview with Arlette de Long 5 spoke about that. I asked a few questions, but I have no idea who they were, what their life was like. My grandparents; I don\u2122t kno w if they were religious or not. My grandfather died when I was eight and my grandmother died wh en I was here in America, I forget, 40, and she looked old. If there was a tradition, I don\u2122t know. What happened is when I was 10 I moved to the subu rbs of Paris; my parents followed a year later. I spent a year with my grandmother there. When my father came, he joined a synagogue in -- in the town where we were, the suburbs of Paris, called Le Raincy, and it was -- of course in France we did not have reform, so it was a traditional synagogue with the woman going upstairs, and then we started going to that. I had no -- really no understanding much. I wasn\u2122t told very much about the religion, I don\u2122t think. Believing in God or not, I felt was more sort of my business. It wasn\u2122t a family thing, and when I was 13-14 I stopped believing anyway, and for me it was more complicated, becau se I had gone to church when I was little in the village, and so...."

The reason was -- later on I was told that there were bombs. And now, this was not in our village. At some time during th e war, and I don\u2122t know when exactly, although Interview with Arlette de Long 6 I think I was pretty young. I must have been about two and a half years old, or three, my mother -- my father joined the army, the French army, as a volunteer. My mother and grandparents left the village, we had a car, and we went down to (?cam-pare?), or someplace in Normandy. I\u2122m not absolutely sure what the purpose of the trip was. My father later said that my grandparents want, and my mother wanted to leave France. Was it because -- was my mother trying to leave, you know, just go away? The story is unclear. The marriage was bad, so it might ha ve been. Anyway, a pparently my father discovered them. It\u2122s all very unbelievable. I don\u2122t know what the truth is. They will not tell me what the story is. But after a while we came back to our house in the village and my father -- well, the army, the French army, surrendered very quickly. So -- but maybe it was -- I must have been -- it was -- must have been in the beginning of the war, because there was no French army very soon after. So, this is my first memory. After that I don\u2122t have any for a long time. I remembered the village, you know, my life in the village. I remember -- I remember really (?bar-is-son?)."

There was no -- there was no chocolate, for instance, or very little sugar and my -- my parents best friend at the time, and my best friend too, owned a store, a grocery store, and I remember I used to go there every day and looking at the chocolate that was displayed, and the candies and wanting some, but everything was rationed, so I c ouldn\u2122t have them, and so, that was really memory for me. There were no explanation, of course. I remember wooden shoes, shoes with wooden soles that were heavy. I remember one time an American or British soldier on a parachute came down, and I think he died, and the villagers got his parachute, which was stained with blood, I think I saw it, but my mother had taken th e - the thread of the parachute and had -- and knitted a jacket for me, sweater, which I absolutely hated, maybe because it had that connotations. Also, it was slippery, it was white, and I remember hating it. I don\u2122t ever remember wearing it, though. I must have."

I think we had it during the war already. But we had a brick house, and the -- we didn\u2122t have a bathroom -- bathroom that I know. I me an, I used to take baths outside in a tub of water, and the house was joined to -- to another house, there were two of them, and in the house next door to us there was an old, old lady who lived there with a -- who had a Interview with Arlette de Long 8 beautiful garden full of flowers. The Germans took that house, took that part of the house, made her move, and we stayed in our part. We had a garden too, but not so many flowers, we had strawberries and potatoes and things. The two yards were contiguous so that I used to -- the soldiers were there -- when they were in the yard, I used to go there too. I remember my mother saying not -- never to eat any of their candies, if they gave me some, because they could be poisoned. I don\u2122t know if I knew, but I knew -- I have a feeling that I knew there was a secret. I don\u2122t think I knew we were Jews, especially. It\u2122s like I had a feeling maybe they were bad, but I was too young to understand, really, whether they were bad or not. It was confus ing. The soldiers were not difficult towards -- I mean, they didn\u2122t harm th e -- the population. They lived with us, they occupied the village, but to a child they looked like different people, but the people, they were not especially frightened, I don\u2122t think."

They fall -- fell on the village not too far from us. Because they had V8s, they had bunkers, the Germans, and they were sending the V8 to Germany from that place.

On a personal level, it was interesting and more complicated, because much later on, about 10 years ago, I was -- at first I had believed, that\u2122s what my mother had told me that no one knew in the village. It was a very well-kept secret and that\u2122s why we never had any troubles. I spoke with a man whose -- whose wife was my father\u2122s mistress, and this was common knowledge in the village, everybody knew, and he certainly would have had incentive to get rid of him, and he didn\u2122t.

I liked living in the village.

I have absolute no me mories at all. It\u2122s all erased.

At night I would put it away. And that was it. That was the end of the war, and then the woman next -- across the street from us, she was a spinster. Apparently, she had been sleeping with a soldier -- with some soldiers , which -- it makes me laugh, because when I was a child I thought of her as so ancient. You know, it was like a 90-year-old woman; maybe she was 30 or 40, who knows, but she felt very injured, and so, it was -- it was kind of comical to think of her sleeping with everybody.

I do have a sense of guilt, that\u2122s one of the reasons I didn\u2122t really want to tell the story because I feel, what do I have to tell, you know, so many people have suffered so terribly, as I know from the group here and children survivors.
