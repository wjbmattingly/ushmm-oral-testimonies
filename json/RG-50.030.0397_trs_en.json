            "question": "Can you tell us a little bit about the town that you born in, and that you grew up in?",
            "answer": "Yes. There were 31,000 Jews living in Bendezi n. Of course there\u2122s not a trace of them today in that town. Life was very interesting and fam ilies were extremely close. My grandfather lived across the street from our home. Life was not ab undant in riche -- riches, but somehow we -- we felt that we are destined to play an important role in the life of humankind, that we have given the world the 10 commandments, not in order to achieve power, but to set moral examples. To set standards of how to deal, how men should deal with God, how men sh ould deal with -- with man. I went, as a youngster to a re ligious, Zionist school. I stayed there for about four years and then my parents transferred me into a secular [indecipherable] school. I remember Friday -- Fridays very well. My mother wil -- getting up very early, going to buy [indecipherable] chicken. And there was excitement of a Friday. Saturday morning I used to go with my grandfather, and sometimes with my father to pray. The town on Saturday was completely engulfed in silence. You see only Jewish people marching to the sy nagogue, quietly. The prayers were -- were [indecipherable] and you felt some sacredness in th e air. I loved those Fridays and I loved those Saturdays. Furthermore, I remember that Jews from its -- Jews from surrounding towns were coming to our town in order to buy chicken, fish and bring them into th e shochet, the ritual slaughterer. They were -- they were buying all -- always for the whole week and then came the next Friday again. I was extremely happy in sc hool, learning about Zionism, learning about -- about Jewish religion, and developing an extremel y fond love for the Jewish people. The city -- the cultural life in the city was on a very high level. There was a Jewish theater, there was a Jewish newspaper. There was a voluntary symphony orchestra. There was a -- was a big library. 3 And there were sports clubs, and we always were trying to participate in the sport events. The community, however, was divided. There were pe ople who belonged to a very radical Zionist movement, the Zhabotinsky movement. And there were again [indecipherable] especially where some of my friends belonged to a socialist Zionist movement. And in the middle there was the mean, mean Zionist. People who did not try to define themselves as -- as right wingers or left wingers. The Orthodox community was also divided. There were strictly Orthodox groups, and then there were groups that did not only believe that prayer is the answer to our problems, but forming or creating, or returning to our ancient homeland is extremely im portant. My two sisters belonged to that general Zionist organization, and I, as a young man, felt that perhaps the Zortinsky movement, the movement that was teachi ng us to go and move to it -- to Israel and fight, I felt at that time that this is the only solu tion. In my town, I did not feel any anti-Semitism when I grew up, because there were not too ma ny Gentiles in town, and there was no contact whatsoever between the Jewish community and the Christian community. We lived separate -- separate lives, not mingling with each other. I remember my teachers were -- who I liked very, very much, they really cared. I remember my uncles, merchants and [indecipherable], aunts that - more pious than their husbands. School frie nds who were bookworms, and others who really didn\u2122t care. But the discussions among all those groups were very heated. We really believed in our cause, and tried to convince those others to join us. We did not have any luck. They were also convinced in their just cause. There was a communist movement in town. Their aim was to move to Soviet Union, create a state there. I remember the name of the state that they were trying to -- to establish, they call it Bi ro Bijam. Someplace in Siberia. I did not meet any of them after the war, and I don\u2122t believe that some of them survived in the Soviet Union."

I was resentful of it. 6 And I strongly believed that only power will force the English people to let us come in.

            "question": "Did you imagine yourself perhaps, getting sm uggled in there and becoming a -- a military --",
            "answer": "Ye -- yes, yes. I know that some of my frie nds who still live in Israel came in 1936 or 1937 as illegal immigrants, being brought into Israel in a very clandestine way. I\u2122m asking myself why didn\u2122t I go. It\u2122s a very painful question. Perhaps even though I felt that this is the only way, and to feel that way, you have to have courage. Could be that I did not have the courage to go along with, being 17 or 18 years old and start a life on my own. My fam ily was a very close family, and I never developed a feeling that I can be alone. And that prevented me from making that fateful decision. In hindsight of course, I would have been much better off, and perhaps that bothers me, and perhaps convince my two sisters af ter I will be there, that they should do the same thing. It bothers me. On the other hand I have doubts that my sisters would leave our parents alone. They were not young any more, and I am not sure that they would have accept this idea of going to Israel, and abandoning -- I\u2122m using that word because this is the way they felt probably, abandoning our parents. My two sisters, if we can go to a different topic, joined me in Krak\u00f3w when I went to the university in 19 - nine -- 1936. In 1937 they joined me. I was transferring to the business academy. I went to the university only to be able to get into medical school. But the quota was very low and I didn't ma ke it. I transferred to the business academy and my si -- two sisters came to Krak\u00f3w to study. But at the same time, I\u2122m not proud of myself, I\u2122m proud of my youngest sister. We made a deal, a ll three of us, that every Friday one of us would go and spend the -- the weekend of the Shabbat with our parents. My youngest sister never failed to go. I had sometimes a -- an event th at I wanted to attend in Krak\u00f3w, sports event 7 or cultural event. On Friday morning I was turn ing to my youngest sister and tell Rushka, I am not going. It is my turn but I am not going, you be tter go. And she always went there. She never left my parents alone."

            "answer": "My father was a merchant. My moth -- mother was a housewife, like in every Jewish family at that time, maybe even every Christian famil y. We had our store and building that my father built in 1929. We lived on the first floor and ther e were three floors above us. Was a very, very capable man, even though he grew up without his parents. He was a self taught individual who cared very much about the family. I was very close to him. My father, even though he had very little schooling, became in that city of 31,000 Je ws, the vice president of [indecipherable] you can call it today the federation, or whatever you want to. That was very unusual because every two years were elections. This was not an appointed position, you had to win the election to -- to -- to be part of it. He won every election as long as -- as much as I remember. He had a very wonderful way of dealing with people, and my father became the [indecipherable] a representative of a big, big ma nufacturing firm in L\u00f3dz, and if people that are buying anything that were produced by that -- that manufacturing outfit, they had to come to us. And I also remember the recession. My father just finished building the house and all of a sudden it became very, very difficult to accept the fact that people are not paying their bills. And please understand that in most of the businesses, people were buying and mi -- and signing a note. And my father [indecipherable] those notes in the bank, all of a sudden he confronted the fact that they\u2122re not paying their notes, and he has to -- he has to redeem those notes. It was a very difficult time 8 because he locked himself in one of the rooms, and did not want to listen to anybody. But as I told you, my father grew up as an orphan, and he ha d the -- he had three brothers and two sisters. The older brother raised the family, and was a very wise man but lived in a different city, about 15 or 20 kilometers from u -- from Bendezin. And he came and stayed with my father for a long time and convince him that not everything is lost , and you should get in touch with this -- with that manufacturer in L\u00f3dz and s ee if they will help him. And that what happened. They came and they bailed out my father, w ho later on, of course, became ag ain a very, very successful businessman. And those were times that were rea lly threatening. We -- we felt that perhaps we have to -- we have to leave school, and that was to me, to my sisters, unacceptable. But thank God for my uncle, and that -- that manufacturing company in -- in ro -- in -- in L\u00f3dz that saved us and our family."

The people couldn\u2122t afford to stay home, they came and lived in those two age -- two old age homes, supported by the community. We had also a very beautiful home for orphans, there were a lot of orphans. My mother spent most of her time volunteering in those old age ho mes, and in the orphan home. And she derived a lot of satisfaction from that. On top of it, from time to time I used to see her in the store, helping my father. And -- I was thinking of cooking, but it is not correct because we had a maid that was with us for many, many years. And she -- my two sisters and I, when we\u2122re youngsters, were more afraid of her than of my mother. She was a strict disciplinarian. We were afraid but we liked her very much because we probably realized that she is trying to do her best to -- to make us avoid getting in trouble. She was a Polish woman, and came during the war asking my parents to move. I as -- I tried many, many times to rememb er why my parents rejected the idea. I wish they would have accepted the idea. But there must have been some reason why they rejected the 10 idea. After the war, I met a nei ghbor of ours who survived in hiding, the age of my parents. They told me, they were convinced that on the same street, my parents are hi ding with that lady that worked for us. But it is a mystery to me why th ey rejected to go into hiding. And sometimes I feel -- I don\u2122t know if I\u2122m justified feeling that way, that they did not want to leave us alone, we were youngsters still. And sometimes I do believe, especially my father, who could not -- who could not perceive that people are going to be killed. He somehow looked at the German nation with admiration for their accomplishments, and he couldn\u2122t visualize, probably -- and I am guessing just -- that those people who he is holding in high esteem, who gave us Beethoven and Bach and Dieter and Schiller and Mendelssohn, are capable of committing such crimes, such heinous crimes. And he felt the war will end an d on the [indecipherable] but I\u2122m guessing, just. But he -- if he will go into hiding and we be di scovered, he\u2122ll be shot. Am I sure about it? No, I\u2122m not. But I was thinking many times about it, and those thoughts crossed my mind. I wish they would have listened to her. She was a wonderful woman, but it\u2122s water over the dam.

But at the same time I do remember that there was a fee ling among a lot of people that he is talking about it only in order to gain power, and to exercise power. But pe rhaps it\u2122s empty talk. And still we were frightened. Now of course, on the first of September 1939, when they came to town, we immediately realized that it is not just talk. There were two events the first two days of -- after they came to town that I will never forget. One we re a family by the name of Schlesinger, father and two sons, running to the synagogue to rescue the Torah scrolls -- from the burning synagogue, the Germans put fire on -- on it -- burne d the synagogue. They were able to run in and bring out two Torahs. When they emerged fr om the burning synagogue, the Nazis shot them on the spot. That was one event that of course frightened us. The second, han -- in hindsight, it was a policy probably, to frighten the people. On the second or third, or fourth day, and I don\u2122t remember any more, they came to -- to -- they entered homes and took out some leaders. And I don\u2122t remember -- remember today how many, but mu st have been at least five or six, and hanged them in the middle of the market. For noth ing. For the fact that they were Jewish. That frightened us quite a bit, quite a bit. The people were really na\u00efve in \u212239. They lived during the 12 first World War, and they felt it\u2122s going to be a static war. And what my parents did is to move part of the business to a town by the name of Jarolsitsa aroun d 30 or 40 kilometers from my town, believing that the war will not -- that the Germans will not come as far, and they will survive and return. Of course, it turned out to be an illusion, and my sisters and I were -- were in the -- together with my parents in that town, that all of a sudden you realize that the ger -- Germans are moving very fast. And the young peopl e were trying to hitchhike and go east after learning that the Soviet Union have entered the war, and occupying east of Poland. We strongly believed that we can survive there. I was one of them, and my sisters did not join me. Again, I was thinking why, why did it happen. And then I reme mber -- I -- I remembered that -- that in all those seven or eight or nine days that it took me to hitchhike to eastern Poland to the city of Lvov, I don\u2122t remember seeing on the roads -- th e roads were crowded -- too many young ladies, too many young women walking and trying to hitchhike and -- to the eastern part of Poland. Why? I don\u2122t have really a good answer. I don\u2122t know why, but those were the facts."

In the first few days I stayed home, but I went with my parents to the city of Jarolsitsa, where as I told you before I was hitchhiking to the -- to eastern -- to eastern Poland. But after being in Lvov, and I don\u2122t remember, three or four months, my father sent a mi -- a mis -- an emissary to tell me that I should return home, that things have calmed down and life is almost normal. My faith in the wisdom of my father was absolutely boundless. I went back. I had a difficult trip. I was on the floor -- i-in the city of [indecipherable] that were only about 10 miles from my town, on the floor of the railroad sta tion. They run -- came running in, trying to find Jews and drag them out. I was on -- I was somehow lying between two or three Gentiles and they missed me. Within the next day or two days later, I came to town. As I told you, my father was a -- was the vice-president of [indecipherable] and he were very close to a -- to young people that 14 were in town form -- they formed a kibbutz that th ey were together trying to emigrate to Israel, waiting for certificates to Israel. And they were -- they were involved in -- in -- in producing -- in -- in -- in planting, I\u2122m sorry, not producing, pl anting food, potatoes and tomatoes. And that was very important and my father, on behalf of the Judenrat, this is the way they called that federation that I mentioned before, was supervisi ng that kibbutz. I was -- my father brought me in and I stayed for awhile, also helping. And then something very unusual happened. I got hold of a book with certain laws that the German observe, and I notice th at there is a law saying that people who work in defense industries -- and we had three enterprises working for German defense industry in town, they\u2122re entitled to additional meat. They call them sverarbeiter, people who work hard. I took advantage of the law. I we nt to the authorities and I was successful to convince them that those people over there are entitled to more meat. And I used to get every week meat designated for them. There was a saus age factory in town [indecipherable] in the nearer -- neighbor town -- neighboring town, Sosnowiec, where we worked hard and produced sausages. Of course it was much easier to distri bute sausages and to cut meat for [indecipherable] and this is where I worked from 1940 or \u212241, unt il deportation of the -- in sep -- August of 1939 -- 1943."

            "answer": "As a matter of fact it did not. Life all of a sudden became semi-normal. The Germans putting men, they called them the [indecipherable] who was now [indecipherable] together with my father. Not giving anything to us, not -- being guided by my father. And we -- life became seminormal. We were walking the stre ets. I am not sure that I reme mber if our youth group met. I had doubts about -- I have doubts about it. But people worked, as I told you in those defense factories, and the illusion that we will surv ive the war became much stronger. That was 1940 - \u212241. And furthermore, young people were -- were taken away by the Germans to Germany to work there. And here the -- the image of the man who was in charge of all those communities, all those Jewish communities, a man by the name of Merin, M-e-r-i-n -- perhaps was a visionary. Perhaps in this -- that feeling came to me onl y after the war, because during war I was very unhappy with the fact that he is cooperating with the Germans. But he understood that people who work are being sent to Germany to help in their defense industry, may have a much better chance than others. Even though I remember disc ussions in our groups at that time, quoting a very fa -- very, very famous saying of the philo -- Jewish philosopher Maimonides, that if the enemy comes, and he is asking to hand him o -- ha nd them over one person that they are going to kill, the community should never accept it. Yes, we should all -- all of us should go. But Merin felt -- felt differently. He felt on the contrary that this cooperation with the Germans and imbu -- imbued young people -- not imbued them, but forc ing young people to -- to accept the fact that they are going to be deported, and they are going to be working in Germany, was perhaps a very good idea. Most of them, most of them surviv ed the war. [indecipherable] the war, we young 17 people couldn\u2122t accept his decisions of cooperation with the enemy. On the other hand, again in hindsight, they had -- if he would not have, the Germans would have taken over everything and massacred us, like they did later on when they invaded the Soviet Union in June of 1942. They came to towns and just took out people and kille d them, massacred. And maybe we avoided that fate. Maybe. But of course, that he will found th at he has a good relationship with the Gestapo, and he can do many things. But again, misleadin g people. He couldn\u2122t -- yes, he could get somebody out of a transport to Germany, but he wa s really fulfilling their wishes. If he had not have done it, would there be other people in town who would have taken over the function? Perhaps. I don\u2122t condemn him any more like I us ed to during the war, and immediately after the end of the war. He fulfilled a certain function in the life of the Jewish people in Bendezin, Sosnowiec and [indecipherable]"

And there\u2122s a very interesting change of minds among people who arrived in Auschwitz and were my friends or acquaintanc es. Maybe after the war I understood it. People who were in my town who I knew were very pious people, very pious people. [indecipherable] starting to challenge God, mocking. Maybe mocking is a too strong word.

I think that the atheists 24 became more believing, blaming themselves for cr eating that situation and forcing the wrath of God. And the other group, the religious group couldn\u2122t understand that God is not interfering. They learned in Jewish history that God interfered in many inst ances in Egypt or -- or Persia, whatever. Why is He all of a sudden becoming invi sible. Why is he not interfering? Seeing small children that are innocent being thrown into the fi re. If I am innocent -- if I am guilty, fine. But how can you permit small children being th-thrown into the fire?

Even though there were no publicity, nobody really was trying to inform the western world at that time what is happening. But the fact that we were incorporated into Germany must have been a factor, that we were living to the ghetto only at the end of \u212242, and perhaps even ni -- perhaps -- perhaps not in \u212242, but in \u212243.

But again, I remember people who were -- who were terribly disposed to Merin, saying that he is avoiding it, that he is trying to avoid, the he is trying to convince them not to -- not to deport us into a ghetto. Did he have so much power? I doubt it very, very much. I doubt it very, very much. Bu t people -- some people believed in his good relationship with the Gestapo and that we can avoid it. But the decisions were not of local Gestapo people or even district Gestapo people. Decisions were made in Berlin. They get -- they got the -- got the letter, or whatev er. Building has to be a ghetto by the first of June or whatever it is. And they were just fulfilling the wishes of the main authorities in Berlin. So I have doubt that he could influence local authorities to postpone it. They would have been probably put into jail or killed, you know, there was no ob -- not obeying. Not obeying a decision made in Berlin would have cost them their lives. So I have great doubts that Merin was able to postpone our being deported into the ghettos."

And he came back and he was telling everybody that -- what happened, and that we are going to be all of us shipped to Birkenau and that we will not survive. That was a warning that came very late, must have been \u212243, maybe June or July of \u212243. But what could we have done? We were dealing -- or li ving in a country with a populati on who are very hostile to us. When I say the population, I am referring perhaps to about, I don\u2122t know, I will guess 85 - 90 percent of the people very hostile to us. They were taking some money, promising to -- to sell out -- bring out guns, never happened. They were denouncing us, pointing out to Germans if they saw somebody who looked like Jewish and was tryi ng to -- to go to -- to another town without that yellow band. They -- they had a way of recognizing Jews, and denouncing them. So what could we have done in June, July of 1943? Very little Very, very little. 31"

And there were rumors and whispering around that the Germans are going to liquidate the ghetto. My family -- I saw my father on that day, very early in the morning, and he said to me, \ufb01I\u2122m going into the hiding with entire family. Maybe you should stay outside. Maybe you\u2122ll be able to warn us, or protect us.\ufb02 And I stayed outside. The Germans su rrounded the ghetto early in the 42 morning, shooting and shouting and creating in [indecipherable] fear in everyone. I was taken to the railroad station with the first transport, the first train, so I did not see too much in town after I left, must have been 10 - 11 o\u2122clock in the morning when they were taking me to the s -- to -- to the train station. I arrived in Auschwitz the same day. And when the train stopped, I saw an unusual scenes. Dogs barking and jumping, SS men shouting and shooting, and one SS man standing in the middle, he looked to me like a very high officer. And people are being asking to jump out of the train. It was complete chaos. Mothers looking for children, and we looking for our fathers. It was complete chaos. Cha-Chaos designed by it -- wha -- by th -- what -- chaos -- designed chaos is what I wanted to say. I jumped out of the train too, and I was brought before that SS officer, like everyone. And I saw that he is -- he is directing people to the right and to the left, to the right, women with children, older pe ople. To the left, young people. At that point I realize that what is going to happen to those older people and children is immediate death. And I\u2122ll never forget that. There were inmates that were coordinating everything. A [indecipherable] inmate walked over to us and we said to him, \ufb01Where are those older people going?\ufb02 He pointed out to the chimney and said, \ufb01You see? See that smoke coming out from both chimneys? Those - in that smoke your parents will be in, and the children and older people.\ufb02 I couldn\u2122t believe it, even though I knew. But I couldn\u2122t believe that this is happening in such a way, so fast. Why didn\u2122t I believe it? I don\u2122t know. I don\u2122t know. Of course, two or three years later, when I realized that they did not mislead us, that this is what\u2122s happened. I was [indecipherable] to a barrack with people from my town, but before coming to the barrack they brought us to a place where we were tattooed, taking away everything and giving us those concentration camp uniforms.

And I stayed in that part of the camp either two or three weeks. Then we were brought into another part of the camp. And in the morning -- in that first camp we did not work at all. In the morning they were dri -- you were driven outside and standing there for sometimes two, sometimes three hours before they led us in to our units to work. I was assigned to a unit where we were trying to clear weed s on the river, the Vistula River. It was so difficult. We were standing in the water, hungry. And in the evening we returned, waiting for that piece of bread and soup. And I made at that point that -- a deci sion that I\u2122m going only to eat the soup and keep the piece of bread for next day. That was of help. I worked, and I don\u2122t remember again, several weeks, or maybe only two weeks. And luck started to play an important role in my life. The Germans established a group of tailors all -- es tablished tailors who were -- who were mending uniforms, correcting uniforms and -- I mean, fixi ng uniforms. And sometimes bringing in certain items that they took away from su rvivors, like shirts and shoes and if they were in good shape, or they needed a little mending we did it. And truc ks were coming once a week or twice a week and carted away those -- that good stuff. I suppose they -- I suppose or I am almost sure that they took it to Germany because -- because consumer goods were not available, not too much was available. People could not, during the war, go out and buy new shoes or -- or had difficulties replacing the worn jackets or shirts. And a cousin of mine was a tailor before the war. He was able to bring me in into that group. So I was re lieved from being on the outside -- outdo -- being outdoors and being under a roof all day long.

And I was again -- that must have been already in \u212244, either February or March \u212244. I was distressed, but I know that they are going to assign me to another commando. Walking in Birkenau, all of a sudden, a man turns around to me and saying to me, \ufb01Are you Herman St rochlitz\u2122 son?\ufb02 I said yes. \ufb01I was a friend of your father.

But again I was under roof, and what was more important was the fact that I had smuggled out a pair of shoes and give it to the people who work in the kitchen and they, in turn, gave me a piece of bread. And that was extremely important. I was in that commando for a long time. But again, luck, what happened? One day a Pole came in, and -- who was bleeding, his feet -- didn\u2122t have any shoes at all, and asked the kapo to give him a pair of shoes. The kapo threw him out. You know, it\u2122s intere sting that those kapos were very eager to hit or to abuse people who in their eyes are weak. Let me finish th is guy. I was able to throw out a pair of shoes. The door was open because he threw him out, and he was sitting not far from the door, I was able to throw out a pair of shoes. Those shoes were my salvation, and I\u2122ll tell you what happened. What happened was that I was shipped or deported to -- first to Stutthof , the camp in northern -- north -- north -- north Germany, where we stay ed, my friend and I with whom I survived Auschwitz [indecipherable], and with whom I wa s very close, stayed in Stutthof, and I don\u2122t remember if a week or two weeks. It\u2122s always a mystery to me why they moved us around back and forth. They shipped us to another camp, Hifli ngen. We also stayed there for a short period of time, and in Hiflingen, the head of the SS walked on the end, we were standing still, he looked at me and pulled me out and say, \ufb01You are staying in the barracks, you don\u2122t have to go to work. I will tell you what you are going to do. If people come in and say to you they are sick, if you have anything to give them, give them, but if not, tell them we have nothing to give them.\ufb02 He brought a -- a bottle of aspirins after a day or two. That was -- that\u2122s the o-on thing -- the only thing that I had was that one bottle of aspirins. But again, I was protected because I was inside. Maybe the work inside is better than under roof. After awhile we were shipped, my friend and I, to another camp [indecipherable]. We were shipped to that camp, and we were assigned to a commando, it 46 was already probably February, or January or February 1945. It was in s -- in the south of Germany. The weather was miserable, absolutely miserable. Snow and ra in and cold. We were assigned to a commando that was going on ever y day and time to divide rocks, you know? Why they needed it, a mystery to me. We were all da y long standing and hitting rocks, hitting rocks. After one or two days, my friend was a little older than I was, and very wise. He was able, in Auschwitz -- yes, in Birkenau to take with him a razor. We hardly made it back, we couldn\u2122t walk, we hardly made it back to camp. And he said to me, \ufb01Sig, there\u2122s no way we will survive one day, what is the difference? Let\u2122s finish it tonight.\ufb02 I walked in, I saw the doc -- the man that I gave the pair of shoes."

He started to shout to her and the first question she said to him is, \ufb01Is Sigmund here?\ufb02 He said yes. She said to him, \ufb01Look, I am the schreibe rin in -- in camp. That means I have to report every day in the morning how many people died during the night and how many are still alive. 48 But I have access to food because of it.\ufb02 Th is -- you know, they don\u2122t know, the Germans if during the night 200 people died or 50 people died. They have a little [indecipherable]. \ufb01I will arrange that he has to come because we need here certain materials that only the men\u2122s camp have, and he will come with some -- some -- with a big glass, or something like -- big -- some container.\ufb02 Oh, that\u2122s better. \ufb01And I will give you -- give him food.\ufb02 And that what happened. And I was going to her every two days or three days and she give us food. And what is even equally important, she became my wife. I said eq ually important, that\u2122s more important. Have to correct myself. Much more important."

What kind of strategy can you have? What -- what can you do? You are at the whim of people who are -- whose aim is only to kill you. How can you prevent it? You have nothing to -- to defend yourself. You cannot run out because you are -- you have the electric wires, an d it\u2122s powerless, with SS men all over, they will shoot you immediately. Even though, I have to be on record that one of my school friends was able to run away from Auschwitz , but he\u2122s -- I believe is not the only survivor among the two or three survivors who were able to run away from Birkenau Auschwitz. I can tell you that he lived 54 in Israel, and he passed away. We were trying -- every time I came to Israel, all my school friends invited me in. We were spending an even ing together reminiscing. We were trying for a year or two to convince him to tell us how he survived. We couldn\u2122t get it. One day -- one evening, I turned around to him -- I was very clos e to him before the war. I said, \ufb01Shumek, you have to tell us. Just for history\u2122s sake, you have to tell us.\ufb02 He was thinking for a moment and he said okay. I can tell you he was talking for a couple hours. You could cut the air, it was such a silence in the room. And he told us that he had a friend who was working outside the wires, and who hid some clothes for him in a hole, and he described him -- where the hole is. And he will -- he will try to get him into that commando to be outside, and then somehow during the day, watching, he should disappear. And he disappeared. And, you know, most of the people that tried to run away were hanged the next day. We didn\u2122t -- and we were forced to watch the hanging, of course. Within a day, two or three, four, they didn 't bring him back, I said to myself and to my friend, he escaped. And he told us how he escaped, and what he did. After two days being in that -- in that hole -- but he took with him some food, being two days and two nights in that hole, he realized on the third day that the search is off. In the middle of the night he slowly crawled all out and went to town. And he saw a light in one of the homes. He entered. He entered and the woman became very scared. He reassured her, an d she kept him for another two or three days. And then he said to her, I have some friends -- again, the woman became his wife later, who are - who look like Aryans not Jews, who are working in Warsaw on false papers. Take me first to Bendezin. We will sit together, we will look like a -- a son, a mother driving, you know, you look -- nobody will pay any attention to us. A nd he was successful. She brought him to Bendezin. In Bendezin he had a friend, a Pole, with whom he was very close. Very unusual to be close, but he was close with him. You -- he came from a very fine family. As a matter of fact, the 55 family lived in our -- in our house on the second floor. And the son was in town, and they decided, you have to bring him to Warsaw to be -- to -- they will infor -- in Warsaw they will find for him false papers, and he will survive, togeth er with his sisters. With the Pole\u2122s sisters. Now, we will survive together with -- with a -- a -- a family that he knew very well, that -- that he knew -- he knew that they are in Warsaw and where they are in Warsaw. That Pole was very smartly shrewd. He took with him on the train, so me bottles of liquor. And they were sitting in the train and trying to pretend that they are drinking. SS man came in and he became friend of them, let\u2122s have a drink. They all became drunk and they didn\u2122t realize anything, they were drunk, completely drunk. And they came to Warsaw with him, a nd found the -- his friends, and they prepared false papers for him, and he was working in a cinema. He didn't look [indecipherable], but here is again something that is unexplainable. In the Warsaw ghetto he was rounded up with other Poles and taken to a place. He wound up place on the floor. An SS man walks in, and looks around and turns round to him, \ufb01You were the one who run away from Auschwitz.\ufb02 He knew that this is the end. At that moment, and artill ery shell is exploding in front of -- of the place, and everybody is running away in the [indecipherable]. Was he smart? No, was luck."

She took that cane and she lifted it, and was standing straight -- all of a sudden she let it down, and she started to shout, clean it up, give him 15. So next day in the morni ng we are walking again into that camp, she is 57 standing at the gate, and -- with SS man, and the SS man is calling my number out. I said to Romek, that\u2122s it. The SS man and -- together wi th her brought me into the kitchen. And she turned around to me and said, \ufb01You are going to work here with me.\ufb02 I stay ed in the kitchen with her.

In an hour or two -- hours later a single tank rolled into the camp. And we heard -- and this was so reassuring, y-y-yo -- you are free. We are here liberating you. I saw it, and I think that perhaps I was not sure that this is true, but in another tr -- \u201another English tank rolled in and I saw them distributing chocolate to people. That was a terrible mistake, pe ople were dying like flies, taking two pieces of chocolate, they couldn\u2122t -- thei r stomachs couldn\u2122t take it, they were dying like 67 flies.

That feeling of happiness, after awhile, and I cannot pinpoint it to two weeks or four weeks or six weeks, completely faded away. All of a sudden, most of us es -- I, an-and I would say most of us felt that we cannot return to our homes. We have no fa milies, but all those liberators will go back to United Kingdom, the United States, and -- a nd live a normal life, but we are alone.

Very strong, depressing feeling. And that lasted for awh ile. But then, after that Rosensaft organized of com -- organized th-the -- all surv ivors, we became more active. That feeling was replaced by a belief that we will manage. It was interesting also that most of the survivors, and of course including me, were trying to get married, to create life again. That was a -- a crucial point in our liberation, to prove to the world that we are going to bring life agai n. And that we will be able to find a place, someplace, where we will be able to restore life. And that what happened really. Those who were more courageous than I went to liv e in Israel. The rest of us went to the United States.

And they transferred us -- they transferred us to where -- about three miles from the old ba rracks and two German m ilitary barracks. They were, of course, completely different. We had the very nice room, there were restrooms around. And I lived, of course, with my friend in that ro om, and Rose lived with her sister in another building not far from that building. I saw her every day, almost every day. End of Tape Eight 70 Beginning Tape Nine ",
                " Probably at the end of 1940 -- to Rose -- or not to Rose, in December of 1945. December of 1945, I\u2122m sorry. We have one daughter, and we ha ve adopted three children. One child was the child of Rose\u2122s sister, that she was able after th e parents were taken to Auschwitz, Rose was able to bring her to a Polish family and she survived with that Polish family. After the war, we brought her back bi -- brought her back to Bergen-Belsen and she lived with us for awhile. But there was a little problem. She was so grateful to that Christian family that she was looking at us as people who are trying to take away her re ligion. And it was very, very difficult. But in 1949, Rose and I went to Israel. I had some family in Israel from before the war, and Rose had a larger family, two uncles, and she of course went with us. And here a dramatic change took place. All of a sudden she fell in love with the people in Israel and she didn't want to return. She wanted to live her life there. And she lives there, she\u2122s married, she has four children, we have how many? Four, five [inaudible] -- we have nine grandchildren there. No, we have four grandchildren and -- and how many did I say? "

I love my grandchildren, and I love my great-grandchildren very much. They come to the States and stay with me, and we have a marvelous time with them. Then, in 1966, something happened. Rose had a cousin in Buenos Aires in Argentina, and they, husband and wife were involved in a terrible automobile accident and got killed. A school friend of mine who lived in Buenos Aires called me up and told me the story and he said, you have to come, because those are two children and nobody knows what to 71 do with them. I will take care of. I went. I spen t several weeks in Argentina. I had difficulties communicating with them, but I was able to get some visas for them to come to the United States. They were tourist visas. They came to the United States and they stayed with me for awhile, and even though when I came to Buenos Aires their friends were trying to tell them -- their school friends that I came maybe to take ad vantage of them. After they came to the States and lived with me for a few weeks, I remember ta king them to the airport because they had to go back to Argentina for me to get permanent visas. They were so afraid that maybe I will not get those permanent visas, they were holding my ha nd in the airport and I reassured them. And after -- and I don\u2122t remember any more, maybe two or three months later, I got the visas and they came to live with us. I love them very dearly. I don\u2122t make any distinct ion between my daughter and the rest of them. And they made me proud of them. One is a professo r -- assistant professor in Boston. He was first at BU, and now he\u2122s in a different college. And one is a physician in -- in New Britain, who became the chief of neurology in the hospital. And the o -- his brother, extremely capable young man, who is -- wrote his story in a very moving way, and who gave us three grandchildren and the -- the younger son gave us also three grandchildren, they come very often, but really not often enough and we spend time t ogether.
