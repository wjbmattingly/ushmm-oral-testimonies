The \u2014 the older SSs left, and we were surrounded only by the lagerfuehrer, who was from Czechoslovakia, a girl, a Jewish girl. So we really don\u2019t know anything much about it.

            "question": "When you heard that you were free, that you were liberated, what did that mean to you?",
            "answer": "We were in a small town. Because we were on the front line, we were given the ammunition for the soldiers. So we were in a farm, in a \u2014 in a stable full of hay, that we slept in. And when they came in and said we got liberated, everybody start running. This is the way it started. That was January 21\u201c, winter, cold, and we were Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak : October 22, 1997 shivering in a barn. The first thing people went, and they were looking for food. Everybody grabbed what they find in the farm. They tried to get the milk from the cow, because the farmers just had left when we got there. The first thing that we did was we \u2014 by the time we realized that there is no more food left, I grabbed a little pig running in the stable. I took a fork, one that 1\u2014 cleaning the stables, and we punched into the pig, and with everything in it, we made a fi \u2014 bonfire and we sat down, about 10 - 12 girls with potatoes and that\u2019s what was our first meal. Everybody was first laughing. I took my belt and I tie it around the pig after I caught him, and I start to make a bonfire. So, got the heat, to warm up a little, and maybe about an hour later, we all start eating on the pig. That was our first meal. And then we started up walking. We had no facilities, no cars, no bicycles, nothing. Whatever we had \u2014 we took our clothes that we had on us, nothing else, and we start going towards the city. And when we got to the city, we asked the people how we go down south. Got liberated in Estonia. And from there we walked, we start walking. We walked from January to March. This is the way we got home, were no transportation. Because we were offered a couple of rides from the Russians. We were 10 girls, we are still in touch. One of them \u2014 two of them passed away since then. Eight is still \u2014 we still talking occasionally together. One is in Canada, couple of them are in Brooklyn, couple of them in Israel I just visited. And we are in Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak \u00b0 October 22, 1997 touch. The 10 of us made a group, and like a chain, we jumped from one [indecipherable] to another one, because there were no bridges. And this was the way we crossed the rivers. We went into houses, and whatever we found, we ate. In certain houses, there was hot food on the stove, and I told them, don\u2019t eat, cause if it\u2019s hot, there must be poison in it. So we ate raw potatoes. We were sleeping during the day, and we were running at night, because we were afraid of the Russians. They picked us up once with a car, one girl went up the car and he start the motor running. So as soon as we see that they start rolling, we pulled her down from the truck. And I said, no more lifts, we have to walk. And there was no trains, everything was banned. Nothing was going. So the only way we were able to go was by foot. And wherever got dark, we start running. During the day, we were sleeping wherever we found a place, in a barn, in a house. Everything was opened. You could go in any house, there was no people around there, until we got to Poland. And then already there we ask in Polish, that\u2019s all that we knew was, [speaks Polish here|"

That\u2019s what we know Polish from the Polish girls that we were in lager together. And they said there is no station. So we kept on Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak \u00b0 October 22, 1997 walking, and we walked til March. Purim, just before Purim, we arrived to Budapest. And there already, we were home, because we spoke the language. We were able to speak Hungarian, and we asked the first thing if there\u2019s a Jewish agency. And we were dir \u2014 were directed because Russian ha \u2014 occupied the territory, and they told us that there is a communist government there, and we should go to the office."

            "question": "Did you get any assistance from the Russians along the way, after liberation?",
            "answer": "No. We were afraid to take anything. When we saw them on one side of the street, we run on the other side of the street, because we were afraid from them. They didn\u2019t have a very good name to people. Even after the liberation they raped a lot of people; we heard about it. And when we tried to take a ride and a girl went in the truck, after then, whenever we see them \u2014 see \u2014 seen them on one side of the street, we run on the other side of the street. So there was no help, or we didn\u2019t have any help until we got to Hungary, which was two months that we left from one house to another one running. Then, in Hungary there already, when we got to Hungary they already called our [indecipherable] and explained them, because there was a couple of people who were in the army, and a lot of people who were in jail because they were communists. So \u2014 Jewish people. There were a lot of them that they jailed them because they were communists. So when the communist Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak \u2018 October 22, 1997 government came over in Europe, they had big positions. So one called the other one to let him know that the Jewish people are coming back. We were, by the way, the first group to arrive in Hungary from the concentration camp. And the greeting was, the dead people are coming back from the other world."

To that extent that the \u2014 from Budapest, they took us by train home, and the first thing that they \u2014 I got home at Decs(ph) they put us in the hospital, and the first thing they\u2019d give us was a bathtub full of ice, cause we were frostbitten. And that\u2019s the \u2014 we were skinny, very \u2014 skeletons. Really, whe \u2014 if you look on us, they would say really that the dead people are coming from the other world. And we were in the hospital maybe about two weeks. There they checked us and they gave us medication, and they gave us little by little food, til towards the end, after two weeks, they discharge us from the hospital.

But when they met, my brother was married already, because he didn\u2019t come straight home. She was a third cousin, and also a friend that we were together in the same camp.

Nine were together all the way from \u2014 starting from the ghetto, and once my sister we met in Stutthof, where she was in a different \u2014 from a different area one. And a girl that was with us found her sister in the other camp. So they changed their dresses at night, and they came to the fences. She came to us, and the other sister went to her, being that we were three, so my sister should be together, we changed places with the other girl. And this is the way we were together from September til January, til they liberated us. Because we were first \u2014 from Auschwitz they took us to ri \u2014 Kaiserwald, and then there were Riga, and from Riga to Stutthof. Then at Stutthof we met our other sister. Cause always whenever you ge \u2014 went to a new camp, we ask, 1s there anybody from the area. And when they told us who it was, we got to speak through the fence. And through the wire fence, we picked \u2014 raised the fence so they changed clothes, and the numbers, and this way we got together."

            "question": "What efforts did you make to try and find members of your family, and friends?",
            "answer": "Well, the first effort we made is we went home to our town and waited to see. So we got home in March, and April was \u2014 went back to our town, and we start looking around. The house was broke \u2014 was vacant, nothing in it, no windows, no doors, Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak \" October 22, 1997 everything was empty, nothing in the \u2014 in the stables, everything was gone. And we start looking around to see if anybody else came home. Then we settled in the city, where the hospital was not far, and we\u2019re waiting to see who else is coming. So the \u2014all the effort that we had at that point was waiting to see, after the liberation from other camps to see who\u2019s coming. And we waited about two or three months, then they start to come, one by one. A lot of people came from \u2014 to our town, from our town and from the city. From the ghetto there must have been about 8,000 - 8,500 maybe, maybe 400 people came back all total. But we waited and we asked questions; where would \u2014 where they were, whom they seen, and if anybody else is coming, and if they met anybody. So we were home that [indecipherable] my sister came home with us, and she found her husband, who was an invalid who was in the army. But he got liberated before, and he was home. So they met after the war, right away, as soon as she came to the hospital, he came right away, and they were together. But we were waiting to see who else will come. And from March, almost another year we stayed home, and we were waiting to see. Then got a letter towards the end, from my brother, who w-was in Austria, who said he\u2019s waiting to see who else 1s coming because there was a big DP camp right there, and they had a list of most of the people who got liberated. But if nobody else is coming home, he suggests we should travel to him, or he\u2019s not coming back. He will go either to Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak \" October 22, 1997 Israel or to South America, because \u2014 or to America, because we had family all over. Before the war, my father was here. But for my mother\u2019s family, we had a large group here. My grandfather\u2019s sisters and brothers were here, and their family. So we knew the names, but we did not have no idea the addresses, we didn\u2019t remember any more. So we had written, and the papers, they had papers that they were sending overseas to see who was left from the family. So we waited til around March. There was a group of Polish people who were entertainers, and they came to our town for Purim in 1946. And after their \u2014 the show, that they were putting up a show in the theater, they were saying, the reason we are entertaining, and we\u2019re going around the country is to let you know that the Russian people are taking prisoners for work. And when they\u2019re taking them, fortunately, the Jewish people, they\u2019 ll be the first one to go again. So I advise anybody who could just leave, the sooner the better. So that was Purim. So the next day we packed, and we start running. So we went towards my brother. We figure my brother was in Austria, and it\u2019s crossing the border, so see what\u2019s gonna happen, we\u2019ll meet him, we\u2019ll see what decision gonna make after. So we packed, and we took a couple of bottles of whiskey, knowing that the Russians, if they are on guard, if we give them a bottle of whiskey, we\u2019ll be able to cross borders. Money, we didn\u2019t have. Whatever we were able to put on our back, we put, and we left. We left, a group about 40. We met Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak : October 22, 1997 from Decs(ph), we went to the border, which was a couple hours by train. And then there was a Jewish organization that was working to the borders. From there they picked up the people to cross them to the border, because there were a lot of people who were trying to bring them to Israel. And we were ready to go anyplace, to Israel, to the State, just out of the communist group. So the first thing they took us, we crossed the border, and we walked about 40 - 50 miles, at night too. We paid off the Russians with whiskey and went through 40 in a group, with three or four people who knew the way, they were the leaders. And from there the first thing we went to, went to \u2014 arrived to the English zone. I think 1t was Innsbruck, or whatever name it was, I don\u2019t remember exactly. And the first thing when we went into the DP camp, they give us injections and they give us a meal and they put us up, and we were waiting to see who else is coming. And there was a lot of groups already. Every days new and new people used to arrive."

And th \u2014 by the kitchen there was a big board that Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak ie October 22, 1997 everybody was \u2014 was able to write down for who they are looking and for what par \u2014 from where they coming, and anybody what group they are looking. At that point I put a sign that I am looking for the Weinstein(ph) family from America, if anybody knows where they are located. And I was there only maybe two or three weeks. My brother was in the American zone. He was in Bad Gastein, which was a one night ride by train from where I was. So he send over \u2014 a couple came from Bad Gastein, my brother paid them, and another person. It was a husband and wife group, and they came with Austrian clothes. And my brother wrote me a letter that somebody will visit me, cause he couldn\u2019t talk on the telephone. And she came over with a letter from my brother to the camp, and she says, my brother sent for me. And I got dressed in Austrian clothing, and I was the wife for her husband, and a friend of mine that I knew, he was supposed to be the husband for her. We changed. From one couple, they made two couples. Like he\u2019s Austrian and I\u2019m his wife, and she was Austrian and my friend was the husband. And he says, just sit in the train and you don\u2019t say nothing. And if anybody comes asking questions, make believe you\u2019re sleeping and I will be dudi \u2014 doing the talking. So we took a train in the afternoon, and we went a couple hours. Then we had to stop because there was no train further that day. And we shared a hotel room that we all slept, the four of us on \u2014 on the floor in a hotel room, because there was no room. And then the next day Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak \" October 22, 1997 we got dressed and we went with another train, and we arrived to Bad Gastein. That place already my brother was there, he was married with his wife. And that was in a hotel. The \u2014 is \u2014 was a \u2014 that was already American zone, and it was [indecipherable] from the American organization. They had a store that people used to go and pick out the clothes. There was old clothes, but cleaned, and you registered there and you get food. But being I was a outsider, I came in illegal, I couldn\u2019t register. So I had a job in the kitchen that I peeled potatoes and carrots, just to have my food. And at night I didn\u2019t have where to sleep, so my brother had the room with his wife, and with two other fellows. So we slept five in one room. My brother had one bed with his wife, and the two boys have \u2014 had one bed. And then whoever came from our group, we were in the alley, sleeping in the room. And we were working in the kitchen. This is the way we lived there until a month and a half, then they got a job for us, legally, they legalized that [indecipherable] are there. And then they start registration for people underage to go to the United States."

Because we didn\u2019t go to school here, so Yeshiva University, when they graduate over a hundred students in a class, and they only took two or three students from ea \u2014 to each school in law school, so I was in the bottom of the list, because we didn\u2019t go to no schools in here, in the state or colleges. So that\u2019s where they ended up, in very good schools. They got a fairly good education, I hope.

They were hardworking people, they really were depending on American fund that they were getting, and they were living different life, very hard life. Like the people who come from Europe, when they started here life wa-was difficult, for them it was 10 times harder. They had to live like in DP camps after they were in Israel, and after Israel was declared a state, because they had no facilities there. And they worked really very hard. Today it\u2019s a very beautiful country. They work less than here. They have a more normal life as far as social life, and they traveling a lot. They are not settled as much as the American people are settled. They take life in day by day because all the time something happens in there.
