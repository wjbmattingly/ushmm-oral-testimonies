            "question": "When you heard that you we re free, that you were liberated, what did that mean to you?",
            "answer": "We were in a small town. Because we were on the front line, we were given the ammunition for the soldiers. So we were in a farm, in a \u0152 in a stable full of hay, that we slept in. And when they came in and said we got liberated, everybody start running. This is the way it started. That was January 21st, winter, cold, and we were Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak October 22, 1997 4shivering in a barn. The first thing peopl e went, and they were looking for food. Everybody grabbed what they find in the farm. They tried to get the milk from the cow, because the farmers just had left when we got there. The first thing that we did was we \u0152 by the time we realized that there is no more food left, I grabbed a little pig running in the stable. I took a fork, one that i \u0152 cleaning the stables, and we punched into the pig, and with everything in it, we made a fi \u0152 bonfire and we sat down, about 10 - 12 girls with potatoes and that\u2122s what was our first meal. Everybody was first laughing. I took my belt and I tie it around the pig after I caught him, and I start to make a bonfire. So, got the heat, to warm up a little, and maybe about an hour later, we all start eating on the pig. That was our first meal. And then we started up walking. We had no facilities, no cars, no bicycles, nothing. Whatever we had \u0152 we took our clothes that we had on us, nothing else, and we start going towards the city. And when we got to the city, we asked the people how we go down south. Got liberated in Estonia. And from there we walked, we start walking. We walked from January to March. This is the way we got home, were no transportation. Because we were offered a couple of rides from the Russians. We were 10 girls, we are still in touch. One of them \u0152 two of them passed away since then. Eight is still \u0152 we still talking occasionally together. One is in Canada, couple of them are in Brooklyn, couple of them in Israel I just visited. And we are in Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak October 22, 1997 5touch. The 10 of us made a group, a nd like a chain, we jumped from one [indecipherable] to another one, because there were no bridges. And this was the way we crossed the rivers. We went into houses, and whatever we found, we ate. In certain houses, there was hot food on the stov e, and I told them, don\u2122t eat, cause if it\u2122s hot, there must be poison in it. So we ate raw potatoes. We were sleeping during the day, and we were running at night, b ecause we were afraid of the Russians. They picked us up once with a car, one gi rl went up the car and he start the motor running. So as soon as we see that they start rolling, we pulled her down from the truck. And I said, no more lifts, we ha ve to walk. And there was no trains, everything was banned. Nothing was going. So the only way we were able to go was by foot. And wherever got dark, we st art running. During the day, we were sleeping wherever we found a place, in a barn, in a house. Everything was opened. You could go in any house, there was no people around there, until we got to Poland . And then already there we ask in Polish, that\u2122s all that we knew was, [speaks Polish here]"

So we kept on Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak October 22, 1997 6walking, and we walked til March. Purim, just before Purim, we arrived to Budapest. And there already, we were home, because we spoke the language. We were able to speak Hungarian, and we asked the first thing if there\u2122s a Jewish agency. And we were dir \u0152 were directed because Russian ha \u0152 occupied the territory, and they told us that there is a communist government there, and we should go to the office."

            "answer": "No. We were afraid to take anything. When we saw them on one side of the street, we run on the other side of the street, because we were afraid from them. They didn\u2122t have a very good name to peop le. Even after the liberation they raped a lot of people; we heard about it. And when we tried to take a ride and a girl went in the truck, after then, whenever we see them \u0152 see \u0152 seen them on one side of the street, we run on the other side of the street. So there was no help, or we didn\u2122t have any help until we got to Hungary , which was two months that we left from one house to another one running. Then, in Hungary there already, when we got to Hungary they already called our [indecipherable] and explained them, because there was a couple of people who were in the army, and a lot of people who were in jail because they were communists. So \u0152 Jewish people. There were a lot of them that they jailed them because they were communists. So when the communist Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak October 22, 1997 7government came over in Europe , they had big positions. So one called the other one to let him know that the Jewish people are coming back. We were, by the way, the first group to arrive in Hungary from the concentration camp. And the greeting was, the dead people are coming back from the other world."

There they checked us and they gave us medication, and they gave us little by little food, til towards the end, after two weeks, they discharge us from the hospital.

Nine were together all the way from \u0152 starting from the ghetto, and once my sister we met in Stutthof, where she was in a different \u0152 from a different area one. And a girl that was with us found her sister in the other camp. So they changed their dresses at night, and they came to the fences. She came to us, and the other sister went to her, being that we were three, so my sister should be together, we changed places with the ot her girl.

Cause always whenever you ge \u0152 went to a new camp, we ask, is there anybody from the area. And when they told us who it was, we got to speak through the fence. And through the wire fence, we picked \u0152 raised the fence so they changed clothes, and the numbers, and this way we got together."

            "question": "What efforts did you make to try and find members of your family, and friends?",
            "answer": "Well, the first effort we made is we went home to our town and waited to see. So we got home in March, and April was \u0152 went back to our town, and we start looking around. The house was broke \u0152 was vacant, nothing in it, no windows, no doors, Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak October 22, 1997 11everything was empty, nothing in the \u0152 in the stables, everything was gone. And we start looking around to see if anybody else came home. Then we settled in the city, where the hospital was not far, and we\u2122re waiting to see who else is coming. So the \u0152 all the effort that we had at that point was waiting to see, after the liberation from other camps to see who\u2122s coming. And we waited about two or three months, then they start to come, one by one. A lot of people came from \u0152 to our town, from our town and from the city. From the ghetto there must have been about 8,000 - 8,500 maybe, maybe 400 people came back all total. But we waited and we asked questions; where would \u0152 where they were, whom they seen, and if anybody else is coming, and if they met anybody. So we were home that [indecipherable] my sister came home with us, and she found her husba nd, who was an invalid who was in the army. But he got liberated before, and he was home. So they met after the war, right away, as soon as she came to the hospita l, he came right away, and they were together. But we were waiting to see who else will come. And from March, almost another year we stayed home, and we were waiting to see. Then got a letter towards the end, from my brother, who w-was in Austria , who said he\u2122s waiting to see who else is coming because there was a big DP camp right there, and they had a list of most of the people who got liberated. But if nobody else is coming home, he suggests we should travel to him, or he \u2122s not coming back. He will go either to Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak October 22, 1997 12Israel or to South America, because \u0152 or to America, because we had family all over. Before the war, my father was here. But for my mother\u2122s family, we had a large group here. My grandfather\u2122s sisters and brothers were he re, and their family. So we knew the names, but we did not have no idea the addresses, we didn\u2122t remember any more. So we had written, and the papers, they had papers that they were sending overseas to see who was left from the family. So we waited til around March. There was a group of Polish people who were entertainers, and they came to our town for Purim in 1946. And after their \u0152 the show, th at they were putting up a show in the theater, they were saying, the reason we are entertaining, and we\u2122re going around the country is to let you know that the Russian people are taking prisoners for work. And when they\u2122re taking them, fortunately, the Jewish people, they\u2122ll be the first one to go again. So I advise anybody who could just leave, the sooner the better. So that was Purim. So the next day we packed, and we start running. So we went towards my brother. We figure my brother was in Austria, and it\u2122s crossing the border, so see what\u2122s gonna happen, we\u2122ll meet him, we\u2122ll see what decision gonna make after. So we packed, and we took a couple of bottles of whiskey, knowing that the Russians, if they are on guard, if we give them a bottle of whiskey, we\u2122ll be able to cross borders. Money, we didn\u2122t have. Whatever we were able to put on our back, we put, and we left. We left, a group about 40. We met Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak October 22, 1997 13from Decs(ph), we went to the border, which was a couple hours by train. And then there was a Jewish organization that was working to the borders . From there they picked up the people to cross them to the border, because there were a lot of people who were trying to bring them to Israel. And we were ready to go anyplace, to Israel, to the State, just out of the communist group. So the first thing they took us, we crossed the border, and we walked about 40 - 50 miles, at night too. We paid off the Russians with whiskey and went throu gh 40 in a group, with three or four people who knew the way, they were the leaders. And from there the first thing we went to, went to \u0152 arrived to the English zone. I think it was Innsbruck , or whatever name it was, I don\u2122t remember exactly. And the first thing when we went into the DP camp, they give us injections and th ey give us a meal and they put us up, and we were waiting to see who else is coming. And there was a lot of groups already. Every days new and new people used to arrive."

And th \u0152 by th e kitchen there was a big board that Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak October 22, 1997 16everybody was \u0152 was able to write down for who they are looking and for what par \u0152 from where they coming, and anybody what group they are looking. At that point I put a sign that I am looking for the Weinstein(ph) family from America, if anybody knows where they are located. And I was there only maybe two or three weeks. My brother was in th e American zone. He was in Bad Gastein, which was a one night ride by train from where I was. So he send over \u0152 a couple came from Bad Gastein, my brother paid them, and another person. It was a husband and wife group, and they came with Austrian clothes. And my brot her wrote me a letter that somebody will visit me, cause he couldn\u2122t talk on the telephone. And she came over with a letter from my brother to the camp, and she says, my brother sent for me. And I got dressed in Austrian clothing, and I was the wife for her husband, and a friend of mine that I knew, he was supposed to be the husband for her. We changed.

Sunday \u0152 during the week Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak October 22, 1997 43we worked and went to school. Saturday and Sunday we used to go to the city shopping or meet our friends.

But if you want to go to that school , I have to work in order to pay for you Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak October 22, 1997 44they should take you into school.

So Sunday night I bathe him and I prepared the clothes and I said, so what is the situation for tomorrow? He said, well, I decided that while I go to school, you work. But once I st op, then you sh ould become shomer Shabbos . So I said, you got a deal. So I kept my promise. But we were working, Saturday was the busiest day for both of us.

And even wh en they went to s \u0152 to Yeshiva University High School, where I took Steven and I put him on [indecipherable] , I went to the rabbi there for an interview, and the rabbi said, and I\u2122m sure you are shomer Shabbos .

They didn\u2122t reduce the price, so I had to work in order to pay it. And they continued yeshiva, but they \u0152 Jerry was even \u0152 when he finished high school and Yeshiva University, he applied to NYU and they called him for an interview. And being that they called him for an interview in Shabbat, he refused to go to that school because they called him for a interview in Shabbat. I said, Jerry, they don\u2122t have to know that you are Orthodox. He said, but can they see I\u2122m in Yeshiva University? Would I be in Yeshiva University if I wouldn\u2122t be Orthodox? So I told him, Jerry, there are many people Interview with Bella Simon Pasternak October 22, 1997 45in Yeshiva University and they\u2122re not Orthodox, they travel in Shabbat. All you have to do is write them a note or call them up and say you want another interview. But he didn\u2122t want to go any more . And for that reason he went to Yeshiva College.
