The 10 of us made a group, and like a chain, we jumped from one [indecipherable] to another one, because there were no bridges. And this was the way we crossed the rivers. We went into houses, and whatever we found, we ate. In certain houses, there was hot food on the stove, and I told them, don\u2019t eat, cause if it\u2019s hot, there must be poison in it. So we ate raw potatoes. We were sleeping during the day, and we were running at night, because we were afraid of the Russians. They picked us up once with a car, one girl went up the car and he start the motor running. So as soon as we see that they start rolling, we pulled her down from the truck. And I said, no more lifts, we have to walk. And there was no trains, everything was banned. Nothing was going. So the only way we were able to go was by foot. And wherever got dark, we start running.

And after their \u2014 the show, that they were putting up a show in the theater, they were saying, the reason we are entertaining, and we\u2019re going around the country is to let you know that the Russian people are taking prisoners for work. And when they\u2019re taking them, fortunately, the Jewish people, they\u2019 ll be the first one to go again. So I advise anybody who could just leave, the sooner the better. So that was Purim.

From there they picked up the people to cross them to the border, because there were a lot of people who were trying to bring them to Israel. And we were ready to go anyplace, to Israel, to the State, just out of the communist group. So the first thing they took us, we crossed the border, and we walked about 40 - 50 miles, at night too.

But Shabbas they didn\u2019t work, but they went shopping, we went to the movies. No work around the house or anything. They used to play cards in Shabbas, but it wasn\u2019t Orthodox. They were more Conservative than Orthodox. And it was sort of a \u2014 for me too, I mean, Saturday used to go to the city, meet my friends.

Saturday and Sunday we used to go to the city shopping or meet our friends. And when I met my husband, we weren\u2019t thinking about [indecipherable]. But then in 1948, when the Arnold Constable estate got sold in Westchester for a yeshiva, that time there was a big article in that \u201cNew York Times.\u201d Arnold Constable estate sold for yeshiva. It was an estate of 27 or 28 acres, beautiful, by the water. It\u2019s a castle, a beautiful place. Everybody from the city came to see it. So I \u2014 we took a ride with friends and neighbors, we took a ride to see the s \u2014 the new school. At that point I wasn\u2019t even married, didn\u2019t even think about it, so I said to myself, it is just gorgeous. If I\u2019ll ever have children, I would like to send them there. And this is the way it started out that I send them to the yeshiva. I didn\u2019t have no other dreams of making them religious, or anything else. Despite that, I came from a very, very Orthodox family. And then when they were born, I send them to school. And Jerry went to school when the \u2014 got ready to go to school \u2014 when Jerry went to school, the first week he came home, he says, Mommy, you know what I learned? I said, if you\u2019 ll tell me, P\u2019Il know. He said, you\u2019re not supposed to work on Shabbat, not you and not Daddy. Saturday is a day of rest. I said to him, Jerry, they are right and you are right. But you have a choice; if you go to a public school, I could stay home and you don\u2019t have \u2014 I don\u2019t have to work.

So I said to him, got time to decide, it\u2019s Friday. Monday you let me know, do you want to go to school, or do you want to go to public school? So Sunday night I bathe him and I prepared the clothes and I said, so what is the situation for tomorrow? He said, well, I decided that while I go to school, you work. But once I stop, then you should become shomer Shabbos. So I said, you got a deal. So I kept my promise. But we were working, Saturday was the busiest day for both of us. My husband came from work and I took the car and I went to work. And even when they went to s \u2014 to Yeshiva University High School, where I took Steven and I put him on [indecipherable], I went to the rabbi there for an interview, and the rabbi said, and I\u2019m sure you are shomer Shabbos. My husband wouldn\u2019t say a word. I said, sorry. I said, the prices you charge, I have to work in order to pay it. I don\u2019t have nobody to pay it for me. They didn\u2019t reduce the price, so I had to work in order to pay it. And they continued yeshiva, but they \u2014 Jerry was even \u2014 when he finished high school and Yeshiva University, he applied to NYU and they called him for an interview. And being that they called him for an interview in Shabbat, he refused to go to that school because they called him for a interview in Shabbat. I said, Jerry, they don\u2019t have to know that you are Orthodox. He said, but can they see I\u2019m in Yeshiva University? Would I be in Yeshiva University if I wouldn\u2019t be Orthodox?

And despite that they were very good students, not because they were my children, they couldn\u2019t get into Columbia or to a school in the vicinity. So Jerry went to California, Alvin went to Saint Louis, and Steven went to Boston. Because we didn\u2019t go to school here, so Yeshiva University, when they graduate over a hundred students in a class, and they only took two or three students from ea \u2014 to each school in law school, so I was in the bottom of the list, because we didn\u2019t go to no schools in here, in the state or colleges.

They had to live like in DP camps after they were in Israel, and after Israel was declared a state, because they had no facilities there. And they worked really very hard. Today it\u2019s a very beautiful country. They work less than here. They have a more normal life as far as social life, and they traveling a lot. They are not settled as much as the American people are settled. They take life in day by day because all the time something happens in there.
