It really was. Learning to live under certain conditions and the way you had to eat sometimes and training was even dangerous at night. When it rained and poured in Texas, then our tent blew over, our pop-up tent blew away, and we didn't know what Interview with Martin Gaudian 62 would happen. We got soaked, you know. Wake up in the morning and they served you some oatmeal and it's raining and, I'll tell you, it was -- and then you had to crawl under the wire fence during the machine gun shooting over you."

And most of the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Martin Gaudian 64 days are just a blank, but that first day and that other day when I saw that other thing, the wire enclosure, those things stuck. And then the girls at the river, you know, because the first ttme I saw any humans other than us. But I think there were only about 20 of us, that was It."

But my guess -- yeah, but someday if I ever find out where I was, I'll have to write you and tell you. I've got the maps at home yet, so I'll try Interview with Martin Gaudian 65 to spot it.
