And we didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t proceed to -- to ask any question, because you know, we were like prisoners in our own city, in our own country. And we were closed in in these ghettos, but absolutely a change. Our neighbors -- our neighbors looked away from us, because when I lived in the ghetto, we had a lody non-Jewish neighbors, they were Christians, who stayed in the ghetto, they didn\u2019t had to move out, stayed in the ghetto and before we were friendly neighbors, we said hello, hi, this, that and right when the Germans Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection came, and the -- and the import of this venom came, right away they changed their attitude.

And that\u2019s what I -- I -- I can think of this -- of this -- actually of this -- of this m -- of this minute. We had a lot of friends that - see a girl who worked for us -- I remember she used to be working, she was a -- some maid, was working, but she\u2019s a orphan.

She liked my mother because she gave her a dowry and she married her off to a very nice guy and sh-she didn\u2019t had nobody.

We were standing down there and he listened attentively and then he went again walking and at that time, you know, my mother was standing in the window and looking and expecting us. If she didn\u2019t got a heart attack at that time, it was a miracle. We opened the little hole, we went in. My mother -- I didn\u2019t hevywith to knock at the door, my mother opened the door, very quietly and as long as these footsteps of the German -- of the Ukrainian policemens, he couldn\u2019t hear the -- the opening or the closing of the -- of the doors. That\u2019s how we went in and we brought our food, whatever -- whatever we could acquire during the day. On the outside we were free, on the inside we have to put again our -- our -- our rags that we are -- that we are branded for something.

And their orders us se -- ordered us in like -- like in -- in -- in five our -- us -- our part of the city was predominantly Jewish, all of the Jews, the rest of the Jews from these small, were crowded. Like I -- I had, for example, I don\u2019t know if I said it in the tape, for example in my -- in the house where we lived, I don\u2019t know, 12, 14 people were in there. They slept on the floor, slept any place we could sleep. And remember, at night, we used to be frightened to death because we had a curfew, at seven or eight. What the curfew for the Jews, nobody was allowed to go out, anybody was being caught outside strolling around, he would be shot. And it\u2019s no less punishment was than that. But at night we used to -- we -- we lived not far our house, was not far from the gate. Actually when you enter the gate in the beginning. So some -- at night, when we used to hear some trucks would be come in to the ghetto and we didn\u2019t know if this is they\u2019re coming to grab some people -- to grab them from the ghetto, or te -- or to -- they are people -- actually Christians who are coming back from work. And we- we heard already the truck passing by the house and going away on the -- on -- on whatever he went, we were quiet down. And in this manner we had to live more than a year. It was an eternity."

Because a few times -- but three times before to make the real acts -- aktion, the real killing. There were like a preparatory -- like for instance, all of a sudden there, they said all the Jews from the ghetto must come to an appeal and it was on Yaki -- on Yom Kippur day. And all the Jews came, they came to the marketplace or whatever, they ask us to come to a certain -- to acertain place and then they ask everybody to go back home. Do you understand? They wanted us to prepare, if the real thing will come, we should know the difference -- we shouldn\u2019t know the difference, we should just come voluntarily, because they ask us to come. I think twice was an appeal like this and I remember my great uncle and it was Yom Kippur and he wore his shawl, he was praying to God and he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going. If they wanted, they come to get me,\u201d but this is what -- just a false appeal."

And this morning, in the morning, my mother came up, she said, \u201cI want you to go into hiding.\u201d I resisted it and I said, \u201cWhat will be with everybody, will be with me.\u201d She said, \u201cNo, maybe let\u2019s try, maybe one of us will survive.\u201d And I remember running with a whole bunch of people -- people with -- women with kids in their arms.

Again my mother resisted and where did I went into hiding, I went to my uncle\u2019s house, who was right by the fence, if you jump over the fence, you were already on the outside, on the free -- on the free world, or whatever, the free side.

And in that barn, they built a double wall and again, a little opening on the side, they opened this opening and the people walked in and when I walked in they let me in, there were about 12 people already down there. And I always say, because it stands out in my mind horrible, this grandmother, this beautiful old lady was sitting down there, with her cherch if I remember, a fine woman. She was asking us questions, what are we sitting in here, why don\u2019t you go out? She did -- was in a raid easily, who knows?

They said, \u201cIf we must go, we\u2019ll burn everything, you know, let\u2019s go all in fire.\u201d And I remember we were sitting behind the wall, we heard some people running right behind in the little alleys, right behind -- by n -- by us. Running back, running forth. Nothing materialize. They got, you know, the German find out about this sheme and more reinforcement came. From the fire department some reinforcement also, with the barrels of water and things. Nothing came of it. In this hold, she had -- that\u2019s was the grandmother, her granddaughter, her son and her son\u2019s wife was down there, plus other people in this hiding place. In the morning, he was -- it was a Mr. Loudier was his name. Mr. Loudier was a very respectable, res -- respected businessman. He was also in the lumber business, but in another town.

He come running back and he was white to his face and he said, \u201cEverybody must come out from hiding. Anybody who will be caught hiding will be shot on the spot.\u201d I heard this and I decided to meet up with my family, but the verdict was the same for the people who stayed behind, for the people who went, the verdict was the same.

And I thought that\u2019s the end of humanity. And I remember this doctor, who was a dentist of mine, who I used to go with my pitten there to her during -- before the war. She was already one a refugee, escape from Warsaw, someplace in Mugrafa, I don\u2019t know. And her husband was a doctor. And they have a little boy and while we there in this enclosure, they -- they throw her in like a piece of rag, like a piece of garbage they throw her in -- into our midst down there, in through the gate.

Now anybody wants to die right away, one I leave for myself and the rest --\u201d And people stood in line. And this is something not to be forgotten. And -- and there is another incident in the ghetto, there was Dr. Coen, because he was in Sarnee. Very fine doctor and a nice family, they had one daughter. And he lived for years and years, as long as I remember -- not like the other one, the other dentist who came, the -- the war, they were down there, local people who lived down there for years and years, is. And when he saw what\u2019s happening, the night when we had to come to this place, the gathering place, he decided to take with his family, his own life. And he had a little food, whatever he prepared, he made a little party, like for themselves and they inject-injected some needles and they die. What -- what --when those Germans and the things ran into the house, they find them all dead. And we were told about it because in the morning right away, we knew what they did. Some of our friends, they said they tried to escape, their name was Korobotchka. You know it\u2019s funny, sometimes I remember the names, gots -- gets into my head and sometimes I just Korobotchka and there was this -- they were also such a fine people. There was a husband and wife, there were already growing children. She was wearing a fur coat and trying to escape from the ghetto. And on the -- on the fence, they caught her in the sh -- they killed her right on the fence, him and her. And they were hanging half here and half there. And we knew right away what\u2019s happening. My friend\u2019s father -- we had our toilet outside -- my friend\u2019s father had to go into the bathroom at night. And he went in and one of the police noticed him 1s moving -- a moving object and he gave him straight to his stomach, a bullet. And they brought him on a stretcher into the gh -- into down there -- to the camp. And he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do nothing,\u201d like he would defend himself. \u201cI just went to the toilet.\u201d They asks a few people to take him- take him across and they killed him right there and then. People who were in the hospital and it\u2019s sa -- in the hospital, they all brought them on horse and buggy down there and to come across the hill and they took him down there. They said they had a undressing place. After I came -- after the war, after it\u2019s -- everything was done -- after I came, I find out all about they made a -- like a tree from -- from a -- like a -- a tree -- like a -- a round -- a tree -- a round thing with one entrance. And in the inside they ask all the people to undress. Some people didn\u2019t wanted to undress. Undressed -- I imagine they wanted still to save the -- the - the clothes from the people to save for themself. To save or to give away or to whatever they wanted to do. So some people decided no, kill us with our clothes. But this was a undressing place. Was made out of brick, actually. Like a -- like a -- a -- a round -- a tute -- a round thing and one entrance.

Because my aunt was sitting down there on the ground with her kid, my cousin was standing next to her with some more people and they were standing, I don\u2019t think my -- my -- my aunt could understand what I was talking to her.

            "answer": "My sister was with me, yes, but we heard that Shimone escaped and he was from a village, he knew the village people and he was something -- some -- some -- I wanted to meet him because he knew our family. Why, I cannot explain, but I knew our family -- I knew he knew the village people and I thought maybe he\u2019Il be some kind of protector and I was right in some ways. So one evening we decided we are going at night, dark at night we decided we are going to that village. And this was like 10 kilometers from that destination. And I start going by a little creek, a little creek I went. At night it was dark, dark at night and at night you don\u2019t d -- I hear the barking of the -- of the -- of the -- the dogs all around me and they are -- they\u2019re on -- then there, you know, like farmhouses. A farmhouse surrounded with the -- with the field -- what they -- what they harvest, potatoes and all those things. And each farmhouse had around, you know -- doe each separated from the other, like in here, too, separate farms. And I heard the dogs sunna -- in -- in -- at night. I -- we went around in circle, twice. And I saw it, now we have to take the creek. The creek will take us out someplace. And my sister and myself started walking by the creek and I heard, at night, in the dark night, I heard some people washing their hands on the other side. Washing their hands and I almost woke -- start blabling out, \u201c\u201cWho are you?\u201d And then I said, \u201cLet me be quiet -- let me -- let me think. Let me hear more words, what they are saying.\u201d They were thieves, coming from the other village, who were tilling out honey from the hives, tilling out honey and some other stuff they were -- they were, you know, they were stealing from the village people, but actually, my family lived down there -- and they were coming back home. I don\u2019t know -- and one said to the other one, after washing their hands, \u201cLet\u2019s get up and let\u2019s go because it\u2019s daybreak, is going to be and somebody will see us.\u201d I don\u2019t know if I would talk to them, maybe they would let us go because we were almost on the same level like with them, they were -- we were criminal. You understand, they knew that we wouldn\u2019t talk against them. I don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s the chance I didn\u2019t wanted to take. They washed their hands, they took this -- the -- the -- the -- grabbed their things and they went back where they -- where their homes were, before daybreak."

You -- the creek took us out to this -- to this highway, a little highway, it\u2019s not a highway like we -- anything here -- to this highway and we knew this will take me to Karasin. During the day we -- I remember we went in -- into the woods, we hide ourselves for some pe -- people who are coming or going somep -- they shouldn\u2019t spotted us. And at night we proceeded. It took us two days til we arrived in Karasin. And I remember the first house we walked in, the woman cried when she saw us. She said, \u201cOh my God.\u201d My feet were bloody, you know from -- from the scratching in the field with -- I was running around and it was already August, late August. And -- and she was crying actually, the woman. She gave us some -- some shoes from leek, like in the Roman times. What we make the shoes from leek, she gave us some shoes from leek to me and my sister and she showed me how to wear them. You put -- you put string in them and you wear them like -- in the Roman time, like the sandals, but this is -- the Romans was fancier, but this was very primitive. But you wear them in the winter, with some rags and then you put us -- those shoes and she taught us how to -- this is my first experience too, at that time. So --"

And I remember going into that village and asked right away Shimone, ou said, \u201cOy, Shimone is in the woods someplace.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhere in the woods, the woods are big, where in the woods?\u201d \u201cSomeplace.\u201d So I slapped over to this woman, who actually taught me how to wear the leek shoes and she said, \u201cGo across this swamp and down there into -- in the woods, you\u2019ll find him someplace.\u201d And in the swamp, you have to know what you\u2019re doing, if not you can sink down there in a -- in a quicks -- in -- in a quicksand? In quick -- quicks -- you know, it\u2019s not sand, but that\u2019s the -- the swamp actually grabs you in. You have to know what you are doing, you have to go just by the path, not to stroll right, not to stroll left. And she told us, the woman told us. We went -- it took us about three kilometers, we went into the woods and when we came right in the outskirts of the woods, with all like teepee. Teepeetel, like the Indians. From straw, but in our -- 1n our country was made from straw. And we saw right away and then there were barns. We saw them -- there\u2019s shepherd guys, must be shepherd guys. Because there were bottles, there were the teepeetel, the teepee from -- from straw. And I walked in with my sister and I said, \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d 1t was daytime. I saw and I -- and I felt the ashes and they were warm. \u201cWay,\u201d I say, \u201cthere are people here.\u201d I gots -- you know it was -- made me feel good. You know, it was -- 1t was -- 1t was in the woods. And I said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s some people in here.\u201d So I, \u201cLet\u2019s wait.\u201d But let\u2019s wait, we were hungry and we had nothing to drink, nothing to eat. I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to a village man and maybe he\u2019 Il give us some food.\u201d And we strolled away a little bit farther and there was a guy who had his farm right in -- deep in the woods. And he was putting up a stack of hay, him and his two sons, with -- with -- with some, you know, with some tools. We went up and I said to my sister, \u201cYou stay.\u201d You know, we were af-afraid of the -- of the light, we were. You know, I said, \u201cYou stay here in case something happen, I want you to know. I\u2019ll go in, I'll talk to them.\u201d I came up not -- not too close, I came within a distance, also I should be able to ran if they will have some bad intention against me. And I start asking him if there 1s Shimone Picov. He said, \u201cOh yeah, he\u2019s someplace in the woods, with a lody more Jews,\u201d he said. I said, \u201cWe are hungry and I would like you to give us some food.\u201d And he start giving me a lecturing, why don\u2019t I go back to the city, why don\u2019t I give myself up to the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Germans? I got so -- I got so upset. You know as -- as young as I was, I understood and I looked at this specimen of a human being and I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t came here for advice, I\u2019m hungry and I want some food, if you can help us with that.\u201d I said, \u201cIf you bore to church, if you do something,\u201d I said, \u201cyou don\u2019t know about your tomorrow.\u201d And I said it to him. And he -- \u201cTI -- I'll send you some food,\u201d but we didn\u2019t trust him. I said, \u201cWho knows, maybe he\u2019ll come out with a gun, he\u2019Il try to sh -- to kill us both.\u201d We stayed in -- within a distance and there a guy came out, a guy who was a forester -- was watching over the forest. And he was friendly to us, he brought us the food, he gave us and we ate and at night we came back to this teepeetel. Why\u2019d we came back -- so I still had very, very, very carefully - before I went in I said, \u201cSimma,\u201d to my sister, \u201clet me listen who are the ke -- who are the guys and who are the --\u201d I looked in through the -- through down there a little hole -- peephole -- and I see there are two shepherd guys laying and down there a guy with a sweater with a little boy laying next to him. And I said, \u201cThis must be a Jewish man. Also escaped like we did. But if,\u201d I said, \u201cif he\u2019s Jewish he\u2019ll say something, avort from his sleep or something.\u201d We were listening -- we\u2019re standing there for hours and then actually it happened. He said something to the little boy and I right away I ran in and I got him by surprise and I said to him -- and I knew the family -- I knew the family, they also were used to -- friends of my parents. I said, \u201cWhere is Shimone Picov?\u201d And I told him who I was. He said, \u201cOh, Shimone Picov, he doesn\u2019t want kids, he doesn\u2019t want nobody else, we are a big group and it\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m going. You take us to Shimone Picov, and Shimone Picov will say we should not come, we should be away, we\u2019ll go.\u201d But in meantime I wanted to go and see Shimone Picov. He wanted to get out of the w -- you know, the dealvy task, but I insisted and I went alone -- and I went and I said, \u201cI\u2019ll go and Pll find him anyway.\u201d So he said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He took me with my sister, we came to this camp, there were about 30 -- 30 Jews o-or something, 30 or maybe 35, I don\u2019t know. Also escaped the same -- the same day of the same -- from different part of the -- of the -- of the - of the country. And they wind up down there in -- in this -- in the woods. Where is Shimone? Shimone is going out, he\u2019s like scouting out. And he\u2019s trying to get a -- a gun. At night Shimone came, he had already a gun and I came up to him with my sister and I said, \u201cI\u2019m the daughter of so and so.\u201d Tears are rolling from my -- from his eyes and he said, \u201cThey are like my children and they are going to stay here.\u201d And he was -- when he said it was -- it was the law. He was the leader of the group. He used to take us and then he used to watch over us. Let\u2019s say he would stay two days in this destination, he would take us to another -- to another destination. We should not sit in the same place, we should not be surrounded by some enemy and be s -- and be massacred. And while I was down there, I used to go to the village and work for the people in the fields and get some potatoes and bring some potatoes in the -- 1n the -- in the -- in the woods. And I was no obstacle, the opposite, I was a help. So I went to the village, I used to work and at night I used to bring him potatoes and he will feed -- give to some food to some other people. And one day -- and this 1s -- I -- amashamont -- one day arrived down there a teacher, supposedly. From the city of Sarnee, where I came from. The teacher came and he announced down there to the -- to the -- to the head of the village, that he -- he was sent by the government to organize a school. Do you imagine the killing was going on, the war was -- was -- was going on and all of a sudden the Germans are preoccupied to open a school in this particular village? The news penetrated to us, we find out very fast and we knew that something is fishy about tt. We have to watch this stranger, what his intentions and what he\u2019s going to do. Within a few days he was asking all kind of questions and everyb -- and everything was -- was brought to our -- to our attention, because the -- the guy who -- the man -- the village man where he s- stayed with them, he was a friend of ours. And he went back to the -- to Sarnee, it was like 15 kilometers from that place on. And came back -- at that time it was unheard, because the Germans would have killed him, because they would think that he 1s a -- a spy for the -- for the -- for the partisans and all of a sudden he\u2019s going free there and back. And we knew right away that the Germans are send -- send him in to -- to find out if there are some Jews there or some partisans and what the movement and what\u2019s going on down there. And we knew we have to get rid of this -- this -- the German. Picov was instrumental. At night he walked in with another guy and they got rid of him. And he couldn\u2019t go no more there and back. Then --"

They would come and they would -- they would make a parking ou -- a nothing out of the village. They would massacre with no hesitation at all, the Germans. You understand? So there was no buts and no doubts. But this was not enough for me, I wanted to join up a big group and I wanted actually to go and fight. And while I was down there in the woods, my sister was a shepherd girl, down there working and I was looking for somebody and all of a sudden, they say a big group of partisans are passing by and I went for curiosity to see, I said maybe, you know, maybe. They di -- just don\u2019t take you in just because you -- you say -- you are there. You know, you have to want it, they question you, they ask you. And while we are standing down there, a big group of partisan on horses, with guns, with machine guns. With this they are coming -- coming -- I liked it -- I said, \u201cOh this is -- this is something great -- this 1s something to fight with.\u201d And right away there is this officer, I saw he\u2019s a officer, because people were wearing noth-noth- not uniform, they were partisans, they were all a potpourri, with all kind of clothes, civilian clothes, not civilian clothes, anybody -- whatever you had, they had it. But this -- this -- this command -- this officer had a -- had a uniform. And we saw by his -- by his coming across to us, that he is some kind of ranking officer. So he came up to us and I was standing there with another girl and we exchanged some niceties and I said to him -- I was the brave one, I said, \u201cI wanted to go in and fight with you.\u201d I said, \u201cWould you fight?\u201d I said, \u201cOh, yes. You'll teach me, I'll fight.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m not in authority tell you yes and no.\u201d He went back to his general -- and he was actually the -- next to the general, the commissar they call him. Politic-Political advisor at that time. Commissar -- it was a political advisor. He went to the general, he came back and he said, \u201cIf you wanted to come, if you\u2019 ll fight.\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cNow or never.\u201d I decided right there and then I\u2019m going. But I had to let words to my sister. That\u2019s how I went. I said to some of the peasants, I wasn\u2019t sure they\u2019 ll tell her or not tell her, she\u2019ll think that\u2019s it, that\u2019s the end of me. Anyway, I went with some -- a few more Jewish girls, we went and we -- we stationed by 10 kilometers from that destination where I started, where it was like my home state on there. Where it started it, it was like 10 or maybe 50, I don\u2019t know exactly, but this is the distance. Down there we stopped, in that village, for at night and I was assigned to a group. I went right away to my commanding officer, I told him that I left a sister. And I told him she doesn\u2019t know where I am and she -- she\u2019 Il think that I am already killed. \u201cWhat is your advice?\u201d I ask him, \u201cWhat do you s -- what do you think?\u201d He says to me -- he thought for awhile and he says to me, \u201cYou know what? Maybe we can solve the problem. I\u2019Il give you my horse.\u201d Something -- he liked something about me -- a very fine man. \u201cIll give you my adjutant. Go back to your sister and tell her that you are in a fighting unit now.\u201d I went back with this adjutant and he was sumpalese attatar -- attatar. And he told me some stories that was fascinating to me at that time. We exchanged slice, the -- we exchanged jokes and these and I told him about my life. And it was such a camaraderie right away. And -- and he said, there\u2019s four barriers, you know, he said_ that they were -- they were, you know, sculpcatters or something, four barriers, [indecipherable] on their back, you know, he said -- and it was So -- you know, it was funny. And we came to the destination where my sister was, to the house where actually I lived in the deep woods, I walked up -- I got off now -- he gave me his horse, he showed me the first time -- showed me how to mount the horse and that\u2019s was my first encounter. I mounted the horse, I went with him and we proceeded til we came to the -- the house. I walked up to the vil -- to the woman -- to the -- to the housekeeper -- to the -- to the hostess of the house where my sister and I lived. My sister was someplace with the cattles, sh -- as a shepherd girl. I walked up to her and [indecipherable] \u201cShe\u2019s the only one,\u201d I said to her. \u201cNow you are responsible for her, I\u2019m going to fight. Now you\u2019re responsible. If something will happen to her, remember, I\u20191l come for revenge.\u201d I didn\u2019t have to say nothing more. I said, \u201cIll burn your house with no hesitation and Ill take your life.\u201d And -- and it was straight to the point. She knew it exactly because she knew it. And they were anyway on our side -- on our side. I left there and I came back to my -- to my unit."

The -- the -- because we have straw in our country, that\u2019s straw on the -- on the -- on the -- on the thing. So right away they put it in, they -- they throw in some bullets, it starts a fire.

            "answer": "You know, it\u2019s funny, no, you know, I didn\u2019t. You know what struck me very much, though? When I gave my ammunition back and I came up to Dubnow, was a city, Dubnow and I came right away, I asked some Jewish people alive, so they used to point it out, this house, that house. And I came to one house and I -- we were like a novelty, I and I have a friend of mine. A novelty when we told them we were partisans, we were fighting, we were healthy looking. And they came out, they were all, you know, white face, they were hiding, they were doing whatever, I don\u2019t remember, even. And there was some kind of rabbi, all was hut in there amongst them who survived. And I told him -- he asked me, I said, \u201cMy parents.\u201d And he said kaddish and that\u2019s what struck me, right then and then, you understand? Because I was busy constantly, with fighting, with doing the things I was doing. But that\u2019s -- that\u2019s when it struck me really hard. And I -- and I saw the reality of the whole thing. And that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- I -- I -- and another thing. When I came -- we erected -- the survivors -- there survived a few survivors from my town. We decided to erect on the place where they murdered the -- the -- the thousand and thousands of people, we decided to put on there a monument. When I came down there after the place, because I escaped from that enclosure -- we cut the barbed wire, we ran out. The rest of the people were taken over the hills, were taken a kilometer or two in the woods and down there -- ditches were prepared and they did it -- what they did in every other place. The same thing, I understand. I was not there because I wouldn\u2019t be here. And so -- so when I came down there and we came down there and we were standing down there, over the place actually, you know, where my parents, my little sister, my little brother maybe down there lay. You know I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t put a tear out of my eyes. I stood down there like a -- like a stone. I -- in -- and it made me angry, you understand? It made me mad like hell. Because something 1s in -- I feel the pain and here I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t express it outside. Then of course, you know, little by little, the start pouring out -- out of me. But it was very sad. Very sad and very unjust, what I was looking the unjustnessty. Th-The terrible thing was down -- my family was a beautiful family. We were not rich materially, but my father was, I think, you know -- I look at the pictures sometimes, the kids say he looks like Prince Philips. I says, \u201cHe was a prince in his own right.\u201d He was a -- he was a great man. He was a good man. He was helping his fellow citizen, he was helping his fellow -- whatever he could. He was in the forest, if somebody needed some wood for the house to build, he used help him out. Because the -- he knew their -- their struggle. You understand, he knew their strugg -- and he was good by heart. Our son 1s just like it -- like -- like his grandfather. So this is -- this 1s all the -- the things what -- what has struck me very, very badly. If you didn\u2019t have time to grieve, where do you -- how -- how do you? We were all the same, we used to talk and we used to reminisce and we used to tell how and what and that\u2019s about that. We -- we -- had no- to go to psychiatrist or to do those things, we just in our own heads, in our own thing, we made -- and at least we accomplished something. When I saw -- when I saw the crushing of their army -- the big superman, they were not supermen. Hitler taught them mean they are supermen. Of course they were supermen against women and children. Against women and children, was supermen. Because they had the guns, we were not prepared for them. But they were not supermen after they start getting a beating. The partisan gave them from one side and then the army, they retreat and under Stalingrad. I think that was the beginning of the defeat. In the winters in Russia. And he -- he paid a price. It\u2019s not enough, the way I see it, but that\u2019s -- at least."

The Gabriel tart are the deep waters already, Africa and there -- down there in the -- on the horn. When we came down there, right away I got like somebody would -- there I got right away sick. I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t even go near the -- the -- the dining room, that\u2019s how darn sick I was. And I thought, \u201cGod almighty, I will never see here, I went through all these things, the war and everything, Ill never see.\u201d I was so sick to my stomach. When they told me the Statue of Liberty, I came out -- crawl out from down there, from the -- my cabin and I 1 looked and it was a sight to see, I remember. I remember it in the early morning, the Statue of Liberty, with the thing and it was -- 1t was very fine. Then we came to the harbor of New York. There was a cousin of ours, were waiting for us. I expected my aunt to come from Washington, she didn\u2019t, but she gave some words to my -- our cousin in New York and she sent her son and he -- and he was waiting for us -- for our arrival. Then we -- when we came, he greeted us, so it was -- 1t was a little bit -- it w -- you know, very -- it was pleasant for us. And -- and I remember on a Sunday we arrived on the harbor and -- and New York. And then another one, she was a distant relative of some kind and she was married and she came also to greet us. And something I didn\u2019t had a good feeling about her, I don\u2019t know exactly, but something about. Whatever -- she was standing, I don\u2019t know, something I didn\u2019t had a good feeling about her. And maybe I thought she did the -- looked down, I don\u2019t know, something -- I didn\u2019t had a good feeling about her. And then he took us to his house, this Dave, who came to -- to greet us on the thing. And when we came out from that - from the harbor, I didn\u2019t like it. I said, \u201cThis is America? This is the United States?\u201d Everything -- you know Sunday, it was deserted and those big factories down there, right down there in the -- it was something -- I did not, it made a funny impression on me. Something -- I expected in my head the United States to be something, something. And here I see this empty and the big, big, huge, huge buildings. And then he took us to his house and when I walked in, it was like in the movies I see. It was as -- a small, little apart -- a nice apartment. It was a two story, with -- with the steps going up and it was -- and I said to Leon, \u201cLookit, it\u2019s like in the movies we saw, American movies, it\u2019s like in the movies.\u201d And there was a television and -- and I remember and also this has struck me very funny at 2 that time. It was a Milton Berle show at that time, very, very, very, very popular, everybody was watching, it was such an excitement like who knows what was going on. And I came the first night -- instead of talking to us, she left us and she went to watch Milton Berle and - and I felt so funny about it, because I said, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t happen this -- in Europe, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d But this is, you know, maybe it was no harm was done. You understand, but I was so touched by every little thing that I -- I -- I -- I just felt 1t\u2019s, you know, it was not right. But this was the first impression about the United States. And they had their daughter- and then I walked in and a -- and upstairs they had her bedroom and she had so many shoes and I ask her, \u201cWhy do you have so many shoes?\u201d It was everything something new for me, something different, than I\u2019m used to down there. But anyway it was -- it was okay. I was a little bit angry at my aunt, she didn\u2019t come, but she was not a rich woman herself, she was a hard working woman. So then -- and then when we came to the -- to Washington, I could understand. She couldn\u2019t leave at that time her husband or whatever. So we stayed. I had a little bit also f-feelings about my cousins because maybe I expected from them more than they could give me. You know, I was -- I was wounded, like a wounded animal and here -- you understand, a little compassion, a little understanding, a little asking about their family. It\u2019s not you and us. It\u2019s not, yet -- it\u2019s the same."

Then it was a house in Germany, a Jewish family, the aroma even of the food you can smell and the singing of the classical music. A -- a regular house, a middle -- middle class, or maybe -- I 1 don\u2019t know what kind of, but they\u2019re Jewish, nice home and then it used to be the resistant and then the family Voss, who saved a lot the Jewish children in Holland, I think, Mrs. Voss comes. I -- I think she comes from Holland. She made a tunnel and I think they saved some- | -- | met her. She came -- she be -- was honored in Washington. Her husband and her. So there were the Voss family, the story about them and then used to be a la -- a little like library with the Anne Frank\u2019s books, with all the books and these and the kids used to go all this way and there was a book with they write their names and after they listen to whatever the eyewitness was. They used to come back and write their impression or their feelings or whatever they wanted. And I had a lot of nice -- nice little notes for me, you know. It\u2019s still someplace in the museum, must be. And -- and I used to explain to them and after we used to give them tiles. And on the tiles we used to ask them after I told them my little story, you know, in the children\u2019s version, I could not go in in this and I told them, you have the Hitler and your orders, explain to them he was a bad man and all the thing explained in their own - in their own level, for them to understand. And then we used to give them those tiles, they used to paint on the tiles and then they put it down, whatever their feelings in their heart. And the best tiles are now in -- on the wall in Washington. Down there where you go down on the -- on the left hand after a whole wall. This is the tiles where I used to go down there and work with the kids. Now they minimized this one, \u201cRemember the Children\u2019, they made it Daniel\u2019s story -- out of it. So this is the Dantel\u2019s story, next -- you know, coming after \u201cRemember the Children\u2019."
