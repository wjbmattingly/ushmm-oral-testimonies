            "answer": "[indecipherable] friction amongst, you know, we\u2019re different -- different completely. It\u2019s like rivalry sometimes, but, you know, deep down there, we do. You know, we went through the war. There were times where she almost gave up and I dragged her out, I pulled her out from a mess. But deep down there -- but there is some rivalry, something she would tell me and she doesn\u2019t mean it, and then I overlook things, I don\u2019t pay attention to her. Or maybe I would criticize her more than I should and I shouldn\u2019t. Then later I find out. But on deep down there, of course. She\u2019s now in Washington, so she -- my son, she\u2019s like second mother, you know and she\u2019s single now. She was married, divorced and she didn\u2019t want it, to be married any more. So we see each other when I come to Washington. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It was very hurtful and I looked at the United Nation and we went away from the -- from the television, it was like a circus on there. Like everybody would gang up on this little country and it\u2019s people, who went through such a horrible time. And mostly a lot of people are composed from people like me, survivors. And why again?

            "answer": "Compromise is, yes. If -- if they are logical, compromise is yes. But what are we talking? It\u2019s a little country, you understand? The logic\u2019ll fit. Let\u2019s say we are talking about iron prayer. The -- if we talk about, you know, I\u2019m not going 1n politics, I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m an American, but this is a small country, surrounded all by the enemies. And they wanted peace. But let looks the other side, you have to be objective and look at it. And they, you know, like -- this is a little bit, you know, not frightened -- Israel will be here forever. It\u2019s here to stay. But it is a concern, yeah. It\u2019s a wonderful little country and it\u2019s democracy in the Middle East and it\u2019s the only democracy and they\u2019re our friends. And you know, I would talk about -- I always show a map, take a look on that teensy weensy Israel and thanks God for they\u2019re round me and they are strong. And my -- my thing, you see, during my second World War, the experience, the way it were, if he would have been stopped, if Hitler would have been stopped after he crossed Austria, the Anschluss and then you see? The appetite came, in the Anschluss and then he started harassing Czechoslovakia. I remember we had a friend, a Czechoslovakian friend, she cried. I remember I stood next to my mother, she cried with tears, poor thing, she was adorable lady. They had a -- a wursht store, you know, from salamis? And they were such a neat people, grade -- we used to come down there and buy for our grocery. And when they -- when they -- when they invaded Czechoslovakia, she cried with tears in her eyes. And you see what happened? They gave him a free hand and what happened? So if he would have been stopped, he wouldn\u2019t have the guts to do it -- what he did to a lot of people. And then he started harassing and we know it from history, what the next step was. So that\u2019s the way I see. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.
