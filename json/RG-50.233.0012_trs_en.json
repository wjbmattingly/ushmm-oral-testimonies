I went to high school and what is the teacher that taught me high school English? In New Jersey. Prepared me for high school diploma. I didn\u2122t have much fr om Germany. Prepared me very well because I had no problems I didn\u2122t have money enough to -- so I dropped out. We couldn\u2122t pay, we dropped out because we couldn\u2122t pay. The college suggest that we move to New York State so that I could go to City College. That\u2122s right in 1948. So we were forced to move to New York.
