And just happens so that the one on top when I came out, the one on top was a white flowered very long, of a woman\u2122s, an adult\u2122s dress, thin, real thin, summer one. It was June but in Auschwitz it was bitter cold. And I had to put it on. And when can I tell you, and they had, they had latrines outside and it was only some boards across. You had to sit on that. But there was no paper, no nothing and the German soldiers were standing behind you with guns. And so when we came out, I picked up that dress and it was lucky for me Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10, 2014 20 because after that whenever I went to the latrines, and I needed to use paper which we didn\u2122t have, I tore off a piece of the bottom of my dress and I used this.

We had to march for quite a while. Oh, and because it was so cold, my mother tore off no she had, no. she had a scarf and she put it on my head which made me look older. And that is why I even survived, because I was not as tiny and young as my sisters. This 11 year old and I was 13. I wasn\u2122t much bigger or, or older looking."

And I\u2122m going to tell you, you heard of Mengele. Well Mengele would come to make selections to take the skinny people, the sick looking ones. And he pulled them out of the line and put them inside the barrack Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10, 2014 21 until the search was finished. And that night a bus or truck came and they loaded those sick looking people on and took them to the gas chamber. And killed them because they had no use for sick people. Only what they figu red is 18 to 35 people who could eventually go and work in their factories. Now while I was, it\u2122s very important to me. While I was in Auschwitz, we were, Blanca and I were very close. And because she was already a nurse back in Hungary before they took her away young, they had, they put her in the infirmary to help the German nurse. One day the SS came when they had the selection, when Mengele put a young woman inside the barrack that happened to have been Blanca\u2122s best girlfriend from home. They put h er in and Blanca knew what was coming. That night they would take her away and kill. So she tried to get her out of there. And they had only little window like very narrow little bitty window on top, up high. You could not get in or out and so she found a box and I don\u2122t know how because I can\u2122t recall any place that\u2122s possibly could have found one. So she stood on the box, reached in and tried to pull her girlfriend out the window so she doesn\u2122t get killed. But they noticed it. They saw it and they put her in with her which means she would be killed. The nurse from the infirmary walked into the barrack and said to her, Blanca what are you doing here. Get back to work.

And so they would send me to the other barracks, to the women in charge or they would send me to the SS women who were guarding us. Or last of all they would send me to the gate, to the entrance, yeah to the gate to the SS soldiers with messages. I was always afraid to go there because I never knew what to expect, what\u2122s going to happen. And but, there was one woman I wish I could find her. There was one older SS woman.

But and they used to put me outside the front of the barrack to watch if anybody was coming and if they did I had to run back and tell them and then they would put the fire out . So this time Bruner came. And I was watching. And I had no time to run back. She wanted to go back with me. So she went way back and she saw the fire in the little tiny stove. She said who did that. I said I don\u2122t know. The window was open and she said who was jumping out the window. I said I don\u2122t know. And she said was it someone who had hair or was, or did not.

And she knew that anybody who lit the fire who was in the back there it was the women who were in charge. And she loved the fact that I was so wonderful that I did not tell the truth because that woman would have had trouble. So I said it was no hair and she was sort of smiling and walked out. And then this I have to tell you in a, before the rest of the story comes. But she loved me. And because I was such a, an innocent little child. And after at the end when they were diss olving Auschwitz, they sent all these women to factories and she came in and said williste kleine mit de blauer algen [ph], where is the little one with the blue eyes. And they said she went on a transport. Ah, that was, she was happy because she wanted to take me out of there. Out of Auschwitz. So there were wonderful people too who could do as little or as much as po ssible to help you."

Gail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Agnes Hoffman. This is track number two and you were talking about now being in this house with a little bit of water. Agnes Hoffman: Yes, yes, yes. It was amazing. There was a bathroom. You could go to the bathroom and not outside. In the latrine. Because while we were in Auschwitz, they woke us up Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10, 2014 26 at three in the morning to go to the latrine. And then back to sleep on the floor. So it was wonderful. Clean and we would sit on the bunk beds in the evening and we would talk about what we would eat when we got free. And we would only be able to think in association what we had. Bread, coffee, and soup. That\u2122s what, we never could remember any other food except to compare with what we had to eat. We got up very, very early in the morning. The stars were still shining. And we would march through the city, through the town, whatever, to the factory. And \u0152"

They, but after a while they taught them and a few of them were tough on us. But there was a family who had a little girl and as we were marching, the little girl ran out and gave me. She was looking. They knew I was a young child. She ran out and gave me some food and then ran back home, out. If they would have caught them they would have been punished. But they did not care. And they did that. It was fantastic. And she would come every so often and bring me somethi ng. In the factory, where I was working, you had to have very delicate hands with, you had to straighten out tiny little wires which was part of an airplane part. And they were sort of twisted and you had to straighten them out. And that\u2122s what I was doing. Other, some people were blowing bulbs and heat with hot, with heat and they had tough work. But most of us were just doing parts of this for the airplane parts. But they were standing behind us, the German and they made us work faster and faster. An d we were -- and then we worked til late at night. And then they, we went back and they took us back home. Home. And the next day, we were there the longest time in Weisswasser. But it was better than Auschwitz. When we started, we heard that there were airplanes coming and bomb these German factories and things. And they had us go outside and lie on the ground, on, and just be there while the bombs were coming. And we said thank God, maybe the bombs will hit them and we can get out of here. We were praying for that. But nothing happened. Then after some few months, we never knew what day it was or date or anything, then they moved us to another factory, Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10, 2014 27 Horneborg and if I tell you how one or the other was, I wouldn\u2122t know which one was which. So we were, I can say that one of the factories that we went to had, it was in a salt mine. Inside, that\u2122s where the factory was. And that\u2122s where we had to go. And it was hard to walk on the salt and all and that was a horrible place for us. So Auschwitz, Weisswasser, Port \u0152 oh Portar , Portwesfall was one before Hone, then Horneborg, port, no Horneborg, Portal , Bendorf [ph] was the worst. And when we got there, people, everybody was full, who were there, they were full of, a man is looking in here. What is he saying? Please, named us. You tell me. Ok. Bendorf was the worst place. It was filthy. The people were full of lice. And it was just horrible. You couldn\u2122t go to the bathroom. You could not have -- wash your hands or anything. It was just a horrible, filthy, dirty place. And we were there for a while. And from the, Port of Bendorf, then they sent us to Hamburg. And then they had a bestial SS who beat us a lot. And it was a scary horrible place where we just didn\u2122t know what was going to happen to us. He beat us. He just abused, abusive person, yeah SS."

We \u0152 it was hard to really grasp that after one whole year we were free. And, but then they took all the people who were sick and to the hospital and that was one of them was me. And I also had an infection on my finger that was very, very, very bad. And they did surgery on it. You know, they took care of it and they fixed it. And then they x rayed and all the things. I was coughing. They found that I had a spot on my lung. I don\u2122t know here in America what you would call it but it was on one spot that was like it was a sign of lung trouble.

You know when they put us in the wagon and pushed the wagon into the woods, when they opened it, I don\u2122t know if I mentioned, 54 people were dead in my wagon and I was one of the six that was still breathing. So when I came to Sweden , they had to put me together. They had to nurse me back to life. And I was in the hospital for a while. And after that they fed me and got me healthy and didn\u2122t let me Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10, 2014 34 out until I was ok. And the re we were very close again with all our friends because we were in the same wagon. And they had a lot of visitors coming. First of all they had people from every paper in the world, overseas and Sweden and everywhere. My uncle in Australia saw this story and saw that I was alive. It was amazing. And so it took quite a while before they let me out of the hospital. I have some pictures, very little but I\u2122ll show it to you afterwards. And they put us in \u0152 they had us in the school yard and people were coming. We were locked, closed off from the public because we were sick, but when we were at the fence and the Swedish people came on the other side of the fence and they kept throwing things over to us. And because I was a small child, they threw a small suitcase, this little one. That was the most precious thing in my life. That was the only belonging that I had. And there was a young man, Leonard, fantastic. He was a gymnast and terrific. I don\u2122t know. He was 20 maybe or 20, whatever. And he would come every day to the -- and one day he took his sister with Ann Marie and then she would come every day with him. And they said when you get out, will you please come and live with us. I said I\u2122ll tell you when we get out of here, they are going to take us to a school. But after I get out of the school, I will come to you. I would love to. And when I came back ten years ago to Sweden, the newspapers came out because they came out the first time when I was there.

And we had a little bit of money, not much. And we were excited. We wanted one. So we went up to the guy, the cart and we said two please. And he opened the top and gave us and opened up the buns, hot dog. And that\u2122s and when we saw it we were shocked. We never had seen that. We wanted ice cream. So we gave him the money and got the hot dog. So we were ashamed of having it because in Hungary when you went to the market people were selling sausage, hot dogs. And that was not nice thing to do. You know. I know in Budapest and in big cities they would sell those things but we didn\u2122t know. Its children. And so what we did was I put the hot dogs inside the suitcase and I was going to throw it away when we got to a place.

I called next day. I called lost and found and they said can you describe it. I said yes, a small suitcase. And he said what was inside of it. And I said a cold dog. Oh no he didn\u2122t ask then. So we went to pick it up next day and that\u2122s when he asked what was inside. And when I \u0152 I was so embarrassed, opened it up and there was the hot dog.

It was unheard of, unbelievable. So but before that I had my first job there. I\u2122m telling you about the fun one. Before they were making marzipan in big kettle and all I had to do is stir the big kettle with the marzipan. But after that I got that good job and it was fantastic. And we had this is \u0152 we had lots, in Helsingborg in that boarding school, we had lots and lots, the last place, lots of visitors. And they were like I said actors. They were pianists, they were \u0152 to entertain us and things. They had a Hungarian ballet dancer who had a place. You know she had a school to teach ballet. And she would come to the boarding school to check to see who would be good to bring to her school. It\u2122s so funny. And of course I\u2122m dancing with the movements and because my father used to teach me to dance. And I did Latin and tango and fox, everything, but here when the music was on, I was gyrating with my Latin movements. She says no, that won\u2122t do. No ballerina. So that was very funny. And then we, yes and then we had a pianist. A young man that was very good looking. And all the girls were surrounded him, with him. And I did not. I was a child still but I was still, I didn\u2122t. And so that was Yalmar , Yalmar. And that was the one time that I saw him. Then many, many years later, I mean towards the last year in Sweden, I was in, at a party and whom do I see but Yalmar. Then he started to take me out. And he had asked me to marry him. And I wanted to go to America. I said no but I \u0152 here I was a young woman before I was \u0152 oh thank you, thank you. Before I was a child and now I was a young woman that he asked me to marry him. H e wanted me to stay in Sweden and I just turned him down and I said when I come to America, if I don\u2122t like it I\u2122ll write to you of course. That did not happen but it was exciting to be considered a human being after that. So then Ann Marie said \u0152 oh we joined, they joined. They were in a sports club where the sports club had a base in, close to a wood. They had a building and the families could come with children or the young people to come and for weekends. And they had all kinds of outdoor sports and all so Ann Marie said to me, the vacation is coming. And we, the other girl , Bisa from the building, other friend and her, we\u2122re going to the sports club\u2122s headquarters, the ten. Are you going? I said no. B ecause I read a magazine that the Swedish peace organization will pay for any young people, anywhere in the world to come to outside of Stockholm to a farmer that will give you a job for six weeks and give you and pay you for the work. And you had to sleep and live in tents. I said that\u2122s where I\u2122m going because they want to Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10, 2014 39 prove that young people, all kinds of people in the world can live together in peace. And I said that\u2122s where I\u2122m going. So when I went there they came out to visit us from the UN. And the Swedish organization. They said we are going to Switzerland to a UN world conference for three weeks. Would you like to go with us? We will cover all your expenses. And that was because I could speak all the languages and the Swedes at that time hardly knew English. They did. So I said yes, I would love to go and then in the mean, I said I\u2122d love to go. As I said we\u2122re going in six cars and with the statesmen and their wives. But then in the camp where I was in the tents, this young woman stopped by one night and said you know I was hitchhiking here and a man, 65 year old man, had given me a ride. And he asked me if I would want to be a governess for his 11 year old child, son. And he lived in a mansion and he was a president of the biggest steel factory. And she said I would have loved to but I told him that I\u2122m getting married so I can\u2122t. But Agnes, judging you, the way that you speak languages, you are acting perfect for a job like that and I recommend you to the man. So she wrote to him and he invited me to his mansion to see if I would like it. So when I got there, the chauffeur met me and then they drove into the front of the mansion. It was like a dream. And he, after a while, after he talked to me for a while. He said I\u2122d love for you to come and take the job. I said I would love to but I can\u2122t because I am going to Switzerland to a UN world conference for three weeks. And he said I will wait. You come back and after that you come here. So I did and I took the job of a dream. The mansion was absolutely breath taking. He had all the servants, all the workers but he wanted someone who could always be a family member so when he went. He travel ed a lot for business and he wanted someone who was close to the boy, not just the servants. So I said ok. I\u2122ll be back, yeah when I came and I took the job. My friends were dukes, baronesses and barons, all and every weekend he had lots of guests. He had this was his second marriage for the 11 year old boy and a six year old girl who was with her mother. But he had grown son who was running the ir plant in South America. He had a daughter who was in New York in a theater. She was a designer, stage designe r. They were grown people. They were and so it was fantastic that he had chosen me to be able to meet all those famous people. They were all kinds of, and locally. And there was an engineer\u2122s hotel there. That he was associated with too. And every time he got an invitation to any big affair there, they sent me an invitation too. Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10, 2014 40"
