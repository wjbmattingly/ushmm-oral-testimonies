We went in and the shower, when we came out, we were naked and then you had to pick up any of the outfits on top of the pile. Take one and put it on. And just happens so that the one on top when I came out, the one on top was a white flowered very long, of a woman\u2019s, an adult\u2019s dress, thin, real thin, summer one. It was June but in Auschwitz it was bitter cold. And I had to put it on. And when can I tell you, and they had, they had latrines outside and it was only some boards across. You had to sit on that. But there was no paper, no nothing and the German soldiers were standing behind you with guns. And so when we came out, I picked up that dress and it was lucky for me https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10, 2014 20 because after that whenever I went to the latrines, and I needed to use paper which we didn\u2019t have, I tore off a piece of the bottom of my dress and I used this. And then after a while the dress almost fit me. So when we came out they got us ready to go on wherever. We didn\u2019t know where and that\u2019s when they took us to Auschwitz. We had to march for quite a while. Oh, and because it was so cold, my mother tore off no she had, no. she had a scarf and she put it on my head which made me look older. And that is why I even survived, because I was not as tiny and young as my sisters. This 11 year old and I was 13. I wasn\u2019t much bigger or, or older looking."

And I\u2019m going to tell you, you heard of Mengele. Well Mengele would come to make selections to take the skinny people, the sick looking ones. And he pulled them out of the line and put them inside the barrack https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10, 2014 21 until the search was finished. And that night a bus or truck came and they loaded those sick looking people on and took them to the gas chamber. And killed them because they had no use for sick people. Only what they figured is 18 to 35 people who could eventually go and work in their factories. Now while I was, it\u2019s very important to me. While I was in Auschwitz, we were, Blanca and I were very close. And because she was already a nurse back in Hungary before they took her away young, they had, they put her in the infirmary to help the German nurse. One day the SS came when they had the selection, when Mengele put a young woman inside the barrack that happened to have been Blanca\u2019s best girlfriend from home. They put her in and Blanca knew what was coming. That night they would take her away and kill. So she tried to get her out of there. And they had only little window like very narrow little bitty window on top, up high. You could not get in or out and so she found a box and I don\u2019t know how because I can\u2019t recall any place that\u2019s possibly could have found one. So she stood on the box, reached in and tried to pull her girlfriend out the window so she doesn\u2019t get killed. But they noticed it. They saw it and they put her in with her which means she would be killed. The nurse from the infirmary walked into the barrack and said to her, Blanca what are you doing here. Get back to work. She saved her life. That was most, most fantastic thing. So after a while \u2014"

They pulled it out of the grass and put it in the soup pot. That\u2019s what they cooked. That was all. So I could not even drink that. At night time they had, they cut the loaf of bread in small pieces. They gave you a slice of bread and you had either a piece of cheese which is one little slice and that was Clodiglee was the name of it, which was smelly cheese but it was very good cheese. Either the cheese or a piece, a little piece of margarine or a spoonful of jello, jelly, a spoonful. So one slice of bread with something on top. And \u2014"

When they came they were in charge of the barrack. And they had one little room at the end of the barrack. It was one long, long empty, dirty room. And they had a small room back there and they had a little stove there that https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10, 2014 23 these women had kept warm. They were not allowed to, these Polish women but they did because they had men come in from transports. Polish men were meeting the transports from Hungary. And do all the dirty work or what they had to do. And they would occasionally come and give these Polish or Czechoslovak women something that they would steal from the train. So they lit the stove and they could heat something. And now that was only for them. And they had another tiny little room very small with a bed. And they slept there. They had cover. These men had supplied them once and for all. And they didn\u2019t come, they couldn\u2019t come to visit. They came to do some work.

A messenger girl and they would send me oh and they gave me luckily, they gave me a jacket, a gray and blue striped jacket to wear and https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10, 2014 24 when it was bitter cold we had to stand outside for hours in wet and cold and I would have that on and it helped me. And so they would send me to the other barracks, to the women in charge or they would send me to the SS women who were guarding us. Or last of all they would send me to the gate, to the entrance, yeah to the gate to the SS soldiers with messages. I was always afraid to go there because I never knew what to expect, what\u2019s going to happen. And but, there was one woman I wish I could find her. There was one older SS woman. Her name was Bruner and she was tough. But she, they all loved me because I was a child and I was a miracle child to be there with the women. So the people, these block guards or whatever in the barrack, the women that were in charge, they were not allowed to light the fire in the little stove. But and they used to put me outside the front of the barrack to watch if anybody was coming and if they did I had to run back and tell them and then they would put the fire out. So this time Bruner came. And I was watching. And I had no time to run back. She wanted to go back with me. So she went way back and she saw the fire in the little tiny stove. She said who did that. I said I don\u2019t know. The window was open and she said who was jumping out the window. I said I don\u2019t know. And she said was it someone who had hair or was, or did not. And I would not tell because those women had their hair. They didn\u2019t cut their hair and so she said was it a woman with or without the hair. I said just bare, no hair. And she knew that anybody who lit the fire who was in the back there it was the women who were in charge. And she loved the fact that I was so wonderful that I did not tell the truth because that woman would have had trouble. So I said it was no hair and she was sort of smiling and walked out. And then this I have to tell you in a, before the rest of the story comes. But she loved me. And because I was such a, an innocent little child. And after at the end when they were dissolving Auschwitz, they sent all these women to factories and she came in and said williste kleine mit de blauer algen [ph], where is the little one with the blue eyes. And they said she went on a transport. Ah, that was, she was happy because she wanted to take me out of there. Out of Auschwitz. So there were wonderful people too who could do as little or as much as possible to help you."

They were going to sneak away from there. But that was impossible. But she was very sweet and sweet to me always. And she said I'll tell you something. Don\u2019t go just with any transport. I will tell you what is the best and that\u2019s the one that you should go with. So but first the transports came and they were looking at the dainty fingers and somehow blue eyes are good eyes, blue eyes. And they picked me to go to that factory. And they also picked Blanca to go to that factory. It was such a thrill that we still were together. So she got me to change wherever I was, she got me out to go with that transport.

Because while we were in Auschwitz, they woke us up https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10, 2014 26 at three in the morning to go to the latrine. And then back to sleep on the floor. So it was wonderful. Clean and we would sit on the bunk beds in the evening and we would talk about what we would eat when we got free. And we would only be able to think 1n association what we had. Bread, coffee, and soup. That\u2019s what, we never could remember any other food except to compare with what we had to eat.

They, but after a while they taught them and a few of them were tough on us. But there was a family who had a little girl and as we were marching, the little girl ran out and gave me. She was looking. They knew I was a young child. She ran out and gave me some food and then ran back home, out. If they would have caught them they would have been punished. But they did not care. And they did that. It was fantastic. And she would come every so often and bring me something. In the factory, where I was working, you had to have very delicate hands with, you had to straighten out tiny little wires which was part of an airplane part. And they were sort of twisted and you had to straighten them out. And that\u2019s what I was doing. Other, some people were blowing bulbs and heat with hot, with heat and they had tough work. But most of us were just doing parts of this for the airplane parts. But they were standing behind us, the German and they made us work faster and faster. And we were -- and then we worked til late at night. And then they, we went back and they took us back home. Home. And the next day, we were there the longest time in Weisswasser. But it was better than Auschwitz. When we started, we heard that there were airplanes coming and bomb these German factories and things. And they had us go outside and lie on the ground, on, and just be there while the bombs were coming. And we said thank God, maybe the bombs will hit them and we can get out of here. We were praying for that. But nothing happened. Then after some few months, we never knew what day it was or date or anything, then they moved us to another factory, https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10, 2014 27 Horneborg and if I tell you how one or the other was, I wouldn\u2019t know which one was which. So we were, I can say that one of the factories that we went to had, it was in a salt mine. Inside, that\u2019s where the factory was. And that\u2019s where we had to go. And it was hard to walk on the salt and all and that was a horrible place for us. So Auschwitz, Weisswasser, Port \u2014 oh Portar, Portwesfall was one before Hone, then Horneborg, port, no Horneborg, Portal, Bendorf [ph] was the worst. And when we got there, people, everybody was full, who were there, they were full of, a man is looking in here. What is he saying? Please, named us. You tell me. Ok. Bendorf was the worst place. It was filthy. The people were full of lice. And it was just horrible. You couldn\u2019t go to the bathroom. You could not have -- wash your hands or anything. It was just a horrible, filthy, dirty place. And we were there for a while. And from the, Port of Bendorf, then they sent us to Hamburg. And then they had a bestial SS who beat us a lot. And it was a scary horrible place where we just didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to us. He beat us. He just abused, abusive person, yeah SS."

The next day they put us on a ferry boat and took us across to Sweden, because Sweden went to Germany and asked them for, at the end of the war, and asked them to give, they should give them 5000 survivors. They wanted to take the Red Cross, wanted to take them to Sweden. And they did. That\u2019s why we went to Denmark and Sweden. So then we arrived in Sweden. Next day. And they took us to another big school. And again they had fixed up all the bunk beds and all the \u2014 they had us, they fed us wonderful foods again, all we wanted. And it was unreal. We \u2014 it was hard to really grasp that after one whole year we were free. And, but then they took all the people who were sick and to the hospital and that was one of them was me. And I also had an infection on my finger that was very, very, very bad. And they did surgery on it. You know, they took care of it and they fixed it. And then they x rayed and all the things. I was coughing. They found that I had a spot on my lung. I don\u2019t know here in America what you would call it but it was on one spot that was like it was a sign of lung trouble. And oh and in that wagon. You know when they put us in the wagon and pushed the wagon into the woods, when they opened it, I don\u2019t know if I mentioned, 54 people were dead in my wagon and I was one of the six that was still breathing. So when I came to Sweden, they had to put me together. They had to nurse me back to life. And I was in the hospital for a while. And after that they fed me and got me healthy and didn\u2019t let me https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10, 2014 34 out until I was ok. And there we were very close again with all our friends because we were in the same wagon. And they had a lot of visitors coming. First of all they had people from every paper in the world, overseas and Sweden and everywhere. My uncle in Australia saw this story and saw that I was alive. It was amazing. And so it took quite a while before they let me out of the hospital. I have some pictures, very little but Pll show it to you afterwards. And they put us in \u2014 they had us in the school yard and people were coming. We were locked, closed off from the public because we were sick, but when we were at the fence and the Swedish people came on the other side of the fence and they kept throwing things over to us. And because I was a small child, they threw a small suitcase, this little one. That was the most precious thing in my life. That was the only belonging that I had. And there was a young man, Leonard, fantastic. He was a gymnast and terrific. I don\u2019t know. He was 20 maybe or 20, whatever. And he would come every day to the -- and one day he took his sister with Ann Marie and then she would come every day with him. And they said when you get out, will you please come and live with us. I said I\u2019ll tell you when we get out of here, they are going to take us to a school. But after I get out of the school, I will come to you. I would love to. And when I came back ten years ago to Sweden, the newspapers came out because they came out the first time when I was there. They came out and they asked Leonard, how come that you got friendly with her, a child. He said that\u2019s because she was so sweet. She looked so sweet that I had to, a sweet, a child that I had to take care of her. You know have and Ann Marie, his sister, he wanted her to come and live with us. And their mother had died, long time before, but their father, Fabro Gustav, Uncle Gustav was the sweetest man in the whole wide world and he loved me like he loves his own children. And he pampered me. He was so \u2014 I lived with them for quite a while."

            "answer": "Yes, yes. Yes. Well they told us how to take the train and take the bus to the other school. By that time we knew what was around. So we got on the bus and we went to the school but I had \u2014 oh I had my little suitcase with me. And when we were in Stockholm, in the street we saw a lady munching on an ice cream cone. And we had a little bit of money, not much. And we were excited. We wanted one. So we went up to the guy, the cart and we said two please. And he opened the top and gave us and opened up the buns, hot dog. And that\u2019s and when we saw it we were shocked. We never had seen that. We wanted ice cream. So we gave him the money and got the hot dog. So we were ashamed of having it because in Hungary when you went to the market people were selling sausage, hot dogs. And that was not nice thing to do. You know. I know in Budapest and 1n big cities they would sell those things but we didn\u2019t know. Its children. And so what we did was I put the hot dogs inside the suitcase and I was going to throw it away when we got to a place. So we went to the school and then we came, when the end of the day, we came back. We were standing at the bus stop waiting. And the bus came, had to rush to get on it. And I forgot the suitcase on, in the street outside the bus. So then oh my god, once I was on the bus, took off, I said I left my suitcase and so I asked the driver and he said you can call lost and found. And I didn\u2019t even know what it was or the name. I called next day. I called lost and found and they said can you describe it. I said yes, a small suitcase. And he said what was inside of it. And I said a cold dog. Oh no he didn\u2019t ask then. So we went to pick it up next day and that\u2019s when he asked what was inside. And when I \u2014 I was so embarrassed, opened it up and there was the hot dog. And he laughed so hard and gave me the little suitcase. And I had a fantastic life for a year with Ann Marie and Leonard. They were brother and sister to me. And then the newspapers came out to Ann Marie\u2019s, to their house. And they wrote the article. Oh but I forgot to say is that when we got back, the first thing they did to us before we even stepped into any clean place, they disinfected us. Cleaned us. No lice, no, no nothing so we were clean already. And but Ann Marie was working for a company but she was only a few maybe, six, seven years older. Maybe she was 23 or 25 but she was like a mother to me. And Leonard was like a brother who spoiled me and he was a gymnast and when he went on a trip https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10, 2014 37 overseas with the gym, national gymnasts. He came back and he brought me a little ring from some other Middle Eastern country. I haven\u2019t got it. Somebody got it from me."

It was unheard of, unbelievable. So but before that I had my first job there. I\u2019m telling you about the fun one. Before they were making marzipan in big kettle and all I had to do is stir the big kettle with the marzipan. But after that I got that good job and it was fantastic. And we had this is \u2014 we had lots, in Helsingborg in that boarding school, we had lots and lots, the last place, lots of visitors. And they were like I said actors. They were pianists, they were \u2014 to entertain us and things. They had a Hungarian ballet dancer who had a place. You know she had a school to teach ballet. And she would come to the boarding school to check to see who would be good to bring to her school. It\u2019s so funny. And of course I\u2019m dancing with the movements and because my father used to teach me to dance. And I did Latin and tango and fox, everything, but here when the music was on, I was gyrating with my Latin movements. She says no, that won\u2019t do. No ballerina. So that was very funny. And then we, yes and then we had a pianist. A young man that was very good looking. And all the girls were surrounded him, with him. And I did not. I was a child still but I was still, I didn\u2019t. And so that was Yalmar, Yalmar. And that was the one time that I saw him. Then many, many years later, I mean towards the last year in Sweden, I was in, at a party and whom do I see but Yalmar. Then he started to take me out. And he had asked me to marry him. And I wanted to go to America. I said no but I \u2014 here I was a young woman before I was \u2014 oh thank you, thank you. Before I was a child and now I was a young woman that he asked me to marry him. He wanted me to stay in Sweden and I just turned him down and I said when I come to America, if I don\u2019t like it Pll write to you of course. That did not happen but it was exciting to be considered a human being after that. So then Ann Marie said \u2014 oh we joined, they joined. They were in a sports club where the sports club had a base in, close to a wood. They had a building and the families could come with children or the young people to come and for weekends. And they had all kinds of outdoor sports and all so Ann Marie said to me, the vacation is coming. And we, the other girl , Bisa from the building, other friend and her, we\u2019re going to the sports club\u2019s headquarters, the ten. Are you going? I said no. Because I read a magazine that the Swedish peace organization will pay for any young people, anywhere in the world to come to outside of Stockholm to a farmer that will give you a job for six weeks and give you and pay you for the work. And you had to sleep and live in tents. I said that\u2019s where I\u2019m going because they want to https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10, 2014 39 prove that young people, all kinds of people in the world can live together in peace. And I said that\u2019s where I\u2019m going. So when I went there they came out to visit us from the UN. And the Swedish organization. They said we are going to Switzerland to a UN world conference for three weeks. Would you like to go with us? We will cover all your expenses. And that was because I could speak all the languages and the Swedes at that time hardly knew English. They did. So I said yes, I would love to go and then in the mean, I said I'd love to go. As I said we\u2019re going in six cars and with the statesmen and their wives. But then in the camp where I was in the tents, this young woman stopped by one night and said you know I was hitchhiking here and a man, 65 year old man, had given me a ride. And he asked me if I would want to be a governess for his 11 year old child, son. And he lived in a mansion and he was a president of the biggest steel factory. And she said I would have loved to but I told him that I\u2019m getting married so I can\u2019t. But Agnes, judging you, the way that you speak languages, you are acting perfect for a job like that and I recommend you to the man. So she wrote to him and he invited me to his mansion to see if I would like it. So when I got there, the chauffeur met me and then they drove into the front of the mansion. It was like a dream. And he, after a while, after he talked to me for a while. He said I\u2019d love for you to come and take the job. I said I would love to but I can\u2019t because I am going to Switzerland to a UN world conference for three weeks. And he said I will wait. You come back and after that you come here. So I did and I took the job of a dream. The mansion was absolutely breath taking. He had all the servants, all the workers but he wanted someone who could always be a family member so when he went. He traveled a lot for business and he wanted someone who was close to the boy, not just the servants. So I said ok. Pll be back, yeah when I came and I took the job. My friends were dukes, baronesses and barons, all and every weekend he had lots of guests. He had this was his second marriage for the 11 year old boy and a six year old girl who was with her mother. But he had grown son who was running their plant in South America. He had a daughter who was in New York in a theater. She was a designer, stage designer. They were grown people. They were and so it was fantastic that he had chosen me to be able to meet all those famous people. They were all kinds of, and locally. And there was an engineer\u2019s hotel there. That he was associated with too. And every time he got an invitation to any big affair there, they sent me an invitation too. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Agnes Hoffman January 10, 2014 40"
