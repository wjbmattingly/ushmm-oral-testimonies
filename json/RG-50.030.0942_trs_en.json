Anyway, they came as \u2014 as slaves, originally, became tutors to the emperors. Followed the emperors to Ravenna when the western empire went there, and when the empire fell, around 500, moved nearby, to a town of Lugo, where they set up shop as bankers, moneylenders, and as rabbis of the Italian rite. Because we are Italkim; we are not Sephardic, we are not Ashkenazim, we are people who were there before the diaspora, and in Italy, and in Israel \u2014 there\u2019s a synagogue in Israel which is the Italian one. Obvious rite. And that was what our tradition was on both sides. And so these people, who had all sorts of ups and downs, ultimately lent enough money to the pope so that he gave them permission to practice their trade in Bologna. And I think the popes meant by trade, banking, money-lending. These people said, but we are teachers of law, because they were rabbis of the Italian rite.

My father\u2019s family, the Calabresi, were, according to their tradition, which isn\u2019t as proven as the other, were traders in Rome in Republican time. That is even earlier. Now, it is a fact that the largest number of people in Rome who were not Romans, at the time of the Roman Republic, before Julius Caesar, before the empire and so on, were Jews, who were traders. There were about 15 \u2014 2500. Different figures, but a significant number of people who were Jews trading. And the story, in that side of the family is that they stayed there, and when \u2014 and settled somewhere south of Rome, where we don\u2019t know. In 1496, everything from Rome south was Interview with Guido Calabresi \u201d July 27, 2017 Spanish territory, and Jews were expelled in 1492 from Spain, 1496 from Spanish territory, Portugal and Spanish territory. Two people went from somewhere south of Rome, to Ferrara. And there is a document which says two people came from Le Calabria. Today Calabria is just the toe. But in Ferrara, at the time, they called everything from Rome south, Le Calabria. And said where two people came, bought lands \u2014 because Ferrara was very open to Jews. I\u2019ll show you some pictures [indecipherable]. And because they came from Le Calabria and there were two of them, we called them Calabrese, which means people from Calabria. Calabrese with an e, meaning person, is quite a common name in the south. Calabresi with an iis unusual. It isn\u2019t always just descendants of these two, but a lot are descendants of these two, and with an i, it often is Jewish.

So my grandfather tried to see if these two were related. Then my father was born, and he lost interest. Anyway, they came to Ferrara, joined the Italian synagogue. There were in Ferrara a German, a Spanish, and an Italian, and they joined the Italian. But it wasn\u2019t because they were angry with the Spanish. If you look at the ruins of the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Guido Calabresi \" July 27, 2017 Spanish synagogue, you see signs of donations by Calabresi because they treated us so well, when we were in their territory. So it \u2014 they were Italkim, who had to be Sephardic when this was Spanish territory, got to Ferrara, found an Italian synagogue and joined up in it, which gives some evidence that maybe the story that they went back, is true. They married into another very, very old and very wealthy family of Ferrara, Minerbi, who are also \u2014 again, the family is all over.

But it was not a religious matter, at all. But people in Italy who were religious, were all Orthodox. Now, for a woman who thought herself liberated, to be Orthodox at that time \u2014 we\u2019re talking 1920s and so on, 30s, that didn\u2019t fit. And so \u2014"

But the most interesting part of them are the motives of the people who saved them, in many instances risking their lives to save them. And the people who saved them ranged from the poorest peasants, who didn\u2019t even know them, to, in some instances, to the wealthiest grandees, everything in between. People did things in Italy, which they did nowhere else. Now, I don\u2019t mean to say there weren\u2019t some people who were terrible and did other things. I\u2019m just telling the story of my family, and every single blood relative of mine was saved. The family of Montini, who became pop \u2014 Pope Paul the sixth, saved one branch. They did it, why? And that\u2019s the interesting thing of this book, what were the motives? Sometimes it was sheer humanity, sometimes it was friendship, because we were friends. Sometimes it was gratitude, because we had done things for them. Sometimes it was fame. Respect for fame. Interview with Guido Calabresi \u201c\u00b0 July 27, 2017 Sometimes motives unknown. But every one of \u2014 I told you of the fascist, great scholar and so on, who walks into the Vatican, and \u2014 which was not open to [indecipherable] Jews. But he walks in, perfectly fine, continues his studies there. His double first cousin, my great-uncle, who had been president of a Bocconi University of Milan, economist Gustavo Del Vecchio, great economist, kicked out by the fascists, because he was anti-fascist. And he, with his sister, who had a house on Lake Como, gets in a boat, and goes to Switzerland. Switzerland is not open, any more than the Vatican is. He gets off. The Swiss guard is ready to send him back, he takes out a letter from Einaudi, who later becomes president of Italy, and who was his great pal, who was teaching at Zurich, inviting him to teach at Zurich. The Swiss guards salute, send for a limousine, and he gets taken there. Exactly the same thing as the other one, as his double cousin. This guy, anti-fascist, after the war he comes back, becomes a cabinet minister in a postwar government. When one is up, the other is down. Analogous thing of how they were saved. Funny."

And he had read some articles of my father\u2019s as a cardiologist, and so knew who he was. And he said to him, I must give you a real surgical question.

Ultimately they were recognized in their fields, but they had a very, very hard time. And I sometimes thought we were outsiders and felt like this, because they were having a hard time. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true, and my example of that is Hanna Gray, who became president \u2014 provost at Yale, president of Chicago. Was a couple of years ahead of me, at this same school. Oh, by the way, this English headmistress was delighted that she had people who were Italian Jewish, and so on, because she was somebody who wanted that, and so on.

And he wasn\u2019t Jewish, so Yale was perfectly willing to have him an-and it was a great, great story, and so the chair was here, and the \u2014 and so I said to Hanna, I expect your experience was very different from ours, because you came, and your father was a full professor already, with his chair and that, so on, and \u2014 and she looked at me, and she said, you\u2019re absolutely wrong. And she described her feelings, and her family\u2019s feelings of being outsiders, 1n exactly the same way. Because it was that just this sense of there you were somebody, here you are nobody. And this is \u2014 it\u2019s odd. Bob Dahl, the great political scientist, wrote a book called \u201cWho Governs?\u201d in which one of the things that he does, is talk about who are the social elite, the political elite, the financial elite, the academic elite in a town.

Political elite, at some point the town of Woodbridge wants to ask me to run as a \u2014 for selectman. Democrats don\u2019t win, but there is minority representation, you have to have a certain number of things. I\u2019m not particularly interested, I\u2019m saying I\u2019m in Europe on sabbatical, but if you put my name down, they need a name. There are Italian Americans living in Woodbridge who always vote republic, because the Irish are democratic. They know an Italian name, vote for it. Why didn\u2019t the democrats do that before? Because if you do that, all the Yale people, and the Jewish psychiatrists and so on, wouldn\u2019t vote for that one. For me, of course, they all vote. So, easy, I somehow get elected and spend some years doing that. Financial elite, they\u2019re looking for somebody, two parts of a bank are fighting with each other. They\u2019 ve never had an Italian on the bank. Compromise, let\u2019s not fight, let\u2019s put somebody who\u2019s totally an outsider on the bank.

My mother instead, whose field in Italy was philosophy of art [indecipherable] is her dissertation, so decides to go to graduate school at Yale. She starts out teaching at what is now Southern Connecticut, it was Teacher\u2019s College at the time, to earn some money while we\u2019re here. She gets fired in 1941, when America goes in the war, because suddenly people decide \u2014 realize that you\u2019re supposed to be a citizen to teach in a state college. And everybody\u2019s desperate, but there\u2019s nothing to be done about it. And anyway, she goes and she teaches \u2014 she decides that she\u2019s gonna get a degree in French, because a French \u2014 German-French department, Henri Peyre, was a brilliant, interesting scholar, and she\u2019d always been interested in linguistics and literature. So she gets a doctorate in French. And \u2014 and that becomes her field. The head of the French department wants her appointed to the Yale College faculty. It is said, and I can\u2019t prove it, that 1t goes all the way to the corporation, which says no. We have no women teachers \u2014 no women students in the college, how can we have women teachers? Logic on logic. So she goes and teaches at Connecticut College in New London, then Connecticut College for Women. Interesting story about marriage and things.

Three Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Guido Calabresi m July 27, 2017 things. Teach, write and look after my family. Because I wasn\u2019t in a research university, I could only do two at a time, and she taught and looked after her family. When she retired \u2014 actually, after the war, she \u2014 Yale is still closed to her, she moves from Connecticut College, to Albertus Magnus, a Catholic college here, because it\u2019s right nearby, and it\u2019s not as fancy. We don\u2019t need it as a backup any more, but she continues to teach. When she retires, she starts to write, and she writes \u2014 well, a book that she wrote in French. We found a letter from the head of the Ecole de France when she died suddenly in Italy, saying from now on Reynaud(ph) scholarship begins with you, so she was able to do that. But I asked her why they didn\u2019t both leave and go to a research university. And I said, is it because in those days, women followed men? And Papa was here, and he wanted to stay here. And she laughed and she said, oh no. What happened was that when this happened, your father was furious, and wanted to leave."
