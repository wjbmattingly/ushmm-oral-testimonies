Anyway, they came as \u0152 as slaves, originally, became tutors to the emperors. Followed the emperors to Ravenna when the western empire went there, and when the empire fell, around 500, moved nearby, to a town of Lugo , where they set up shop as bankers, moneylenders, and as rabbis of the Italian rite . Because we are Italkim; we are not Sephardic, we are not Ashkenazim, we are people who were there before the diaspora, and in Italy, and in Israel \u0152 there\u2122s a synagogue in Israel which is the Italian one. Obvious rite. And that was what our tradition was on both sides. And so these people, who had all sorts of ups and downs, ultimately lent enough money to the pope so that he gave them permission to practice their trade in Bologna . And I think the popes meant by trade, banking, money -lending. These people said, but we are teachers of law, because they were rabbis of the Italian rite. And so, I don\u2122t know if it\u2122s true, but somehow \u0152 but the \u0152 the legend is that the way we got into law teaching was because of this.

My father\u2122s family, the Calabresi , were, according to their tradition, which isn\u2122t as proven as the other, were traders in Rome in Republican time. That is even earlier. Now, it is a fact that the largest number of people in Rome who were not Romans, at the time of the Roman Republic, before Julius Caesar , before the empire and so on, were Jews, who were traders. There were about 15 \u0152 2500. Different figures, but a significant number of people who were Jews trading. And the story, in that side of the family is that they stayed there, and when \u0152 and settled somewhere south of Rome , where we don\u2122t know. In 1496, everything from Rome south was Interview with Guido Calabresi July 27, 2017 9 Spanish territory, and Jews were expelled in 1492 from Spain , 1496 from Spanish territory, Portugal and Spanish territory. Two people went from somewhere south of Rome , to Ferrara . And there is a document which says two people came from Le Calabria . Today Calabria is just the toe. But in Ferrara , at the time, they called everything from Rome south, Le Calabria . And said where two people came, bought lands \u0152 because Ferrara was very open to Jews. I\u2122ll show you some pictures [indecipherable] . And because they came from Le Calabria and there were two of them, we called them Calabrese , which means p eople from Calabria . Calabrese with an e, meaning person, is quite a common name in the south. Calabresi with an i is unusual. It isn\u2122t always just descendants of these two, but a lot are descendants of these two, and with an i, it often is Jewish. With and e \u0152 not always, but often is \u0152 with an e, almost never."

So my grandfather tried to see if these two were related. Then my father was born, and he lost interest. Anyway, they came to Ferrara , joined the Italian synagogue. There were in Ferrara a German, a Spanish, and an Italian, and they joined the Italian. But it wasn\u2122t because they were angry with the Spanish. If you look at the ruins of the Interview with Guido Calabresi July 27, 2017 10 Spanish synagogue, you see signs of donations by Calabresi because they treated us so well, when we were in their territory. So it \u0152 they were Italkim, who had to be Sephardic when this was Spanish territory, got to Ferrara , found an Italian synagogue and joined up in it, which gives some evidence that maybe the story that they went back, is true. They married into another very, very old and very wealthy family of Ferrara , Minerbi , who are also \u0152 again, the family is all over. One of them, Sergio Minerbi is in Israel and was the ambassador of Israel to the unite \u0152 to Europe , and \u0152 and at one point to the Vatican, which he didn\u2122t much like.

My father\u2122s first cousin and best friend, was the patron of Bassani , the man who wrote the book from which the movie was taken.

And at other times you have names which are clearly Jewish, Ekakoh (ph), Solomone (ph), Interview with Guido Calabresi July 27, 2017 15 Abramo (ph), and so on. So that I think \u0152 and I think it is clearly the case, that at many times, in the history of these families, some married Catholics, some assimilated, some came back.

He was a not a believer in any way, though he wanted, and we\u2122ll talk about that, to be buried in the Jewish cemetery in Ferrara , and he \u0152 it\u2122s a complicated business. But he would, I think, have been extremely upset if my mother had done what many, many people in her family, and in all sorts of other families did, was to convert because of the racial laws. Because he would have thought \u0152 he thought that was cowardly. Or, done for financial reasons, which it was done. I\u2122m not one to judge; many people did that, and so on. My mother converted, I\u2122m quite sure, for a very odd reason. She was a highly intellectual woman, PhD in Italy , PhD here. In some ways, a feminist. And not in a modern way, but a woman who \u0152 and at some point, she decided she believed in God. And Interview with Guido Calabresi July 27, 2017 19 the problem was that all these ancient Italian Jewish families, pretty much all of them, were non-practicing, nonbelievers. I mean, you know, we were Jewish because that was the great tradition. It was almost a snobbery. It was something we were very, very keen on, and are still very, very keen on. But it was not a religious matter, at all. But people in Italy who were religious, were all Orthodox. Now, for a woman who thought herself liberated, to be Orthodox at that time \u0152 we\u2122re talking 1920s and so on, 30s, that didn\u2122t fit. And so \u0152"

My father said, I was 21 years old. If somebody had told me that if I went and didn\u2122t applaud I\u2122d get into trouble, I probably would have stayed home. Or I might even have gone and applauded. But here I didn\u2122t applaud, and now somebody told me I had to applaud. I couldn\u2122t do it. So I didn\u2122t applaud the next time, and when we left, we got picked up and beaten up. And I said, what happened then? He said, we went to wash. And I said, why? He said, we didn\u2122t want to go home, people lived at home, and they [indecipherable] the university, and show ourselves bloody, to scare our \u0152 our parents would have been frightened.

He became a little bit \u0152 but we washed there, and the fascists thought that we did, and so they picked us up again and beat us up again and tossed us into jail.

And the people who saved them ranged from the poorest peasants, who didn\u2122t even know them, to, in some instances, to the wealthiest grandees, everything in between. People did things in Italy, which they did nowhere else. Now, I don\u2122t mean to say there weren\u2122t some people who were terrible and did other things. I\u2122m just telling the story of my family, and every single blood relative of mine was saved. The family of Montini , who became pop \u0152 Pope Paul the sixth, saved one branch. They did it, why? And that\u2122s the interesting thing of this book, what were the motives? Sometimes it was sheer humanity, sometimes it was friendship, because we were friends. Sometimes it was gratitude, because we had done things for them. Sometimes it was fame. Respect for fame. Interview with Guido Calabresi July 27, 2017 68 Sometimes motives unknown. But every one of \u0152 I told you of the fascist, great scholar and so on, who walks into the Vatican, and \u0152 which was not open to [indecipherable] Jews. But he walks in, perfectly fine, continues his studies there. His double first cousin, my great-uncle, who had been president of a Bocconi University of Milan, economist Gustavo Del Vecchio , great economist, kicked out by the fascists, because he was anti-fascist. And he, with his sister, who had a house on Lake Como , gets in a boat, and goes to Switzerland . Switzerland is not open, any more than the Vatican is. He gets off. The Swiss guard is ready to send him back, he takes out a letter from Einaudi , who later becomes president of Italy, and who was his great pal, who was teaching at Zurich , inviting him to teach at Zurich . The Swiss guards salute, send for a limousine, and he gets taken there. Exactly the same thing as the other one, as his double cousin. This guy, anti-fascist, after the war he comes back, becomes a cabinet minister in a postwar government. When one is up, the other is down. Analogous thing of how they were saved. Funny."

It was during the day, everybody was out working, so there weren\u2122t any real casualties, but the village is destroyed. My grandmother says, so I did what any decent person would do, I invited the village into the villa. And she said, every family got a room, and we set it all up, and I taught all the women to work. She did wonderful needlepoint. And I taught the men to play poker. She was of a generation before bridge, it was what card playing people would do. We had a wonderful time, she said, and she describes this wonderful thing, with the whole village living in the villa all together. This almost 90 year old, tiny little person, just teaching. She was always a teacher, and doing Interview with Guido Calabresi July 27, 2017 71 these other things. And then she said, the Germans arrived. They had heard that there was an old Jewish lady there. So they came to get me. And the village men came out with pitchforks, hatchets, you know, and said to the German captain, over our dead bodies. They had been taken in. And the German captain looks at it, and realizes that, of course, he could mow them down, but he\u2122s probably lose some men, and it would be \u0152 and thinks, here\u2122s an almost 90 year old person, she\u2122s gonna die anyway.

And one of the reasons I want to write this, is because what happened in Italy \u0152 and again, now some people, including some c-cousin of mine, are writing about the people in Italy who did betray, who did behave badly. But more people were saved in Italy, than in any other country, with a possible exception of Denmark . And in Denmark it was the official policy of the king, and people just followed it wonderfully, and people were saved. In Italy, what was interesting about it was that it was against the policy of the government, and yet people behaved in ways which saved people. Now, a fair number of people were taken. About 10,000 people were taken in Rome , right after Italy surrendered, Interview with Guido Calabresi July 27, 2017 76 because the Roman Jewish community was \u0152 there was an old community around the old Italian temple, of people who were relatively poor, and still living there, as against all these assimilated people all over. They too didn\u2122t think that anything was going to happen. And the Germans moved in, and took any number of them, a few days, right after. And it\u2122s that that gave the signal, and everybody else went hid, afterwards. So it immediately, a fair number. So if you look a fair number of people were taken. After that, very, very few people were taken, because Italians hid people. Why? That\u2122s part of the story of this book. I mean, sometimes, just hum anity. Sometimes \u0152 and you know, sometimes the churches hid people. The cardinal archbishop of Florence was maybe the only man to vote against Pius the 12th [inde cipherable] . He was much loved by people, and they tell the story, which I repeat in the book, but it isn\u2122t my story, but \u0152 but he told all the monasteries and nunneries to hide people. And that some people were being hidden in a nunnery, which had been a closed nunnery, and there were men who were being hidden, and \u0152 and young men and young nuns, and inevitably people started making love, and the Mother Superior is said, according to the story, that is very popular with Florentines, goes to the cardinal and says, terrible sins are being committed here, we cannot have this going on. And the cardinal says, Mother, what do you think is Interview with Guido Calabresi July 27, 2017 77 worse? What is happening there, or to turn people out to be killed?

My mother, instead, spoke English with an English accent, French was her second language, English her third language, because she had had an English governess. Have you any autumn apples? When she came, it was how she spoke. But he found the language exam funnily easy, because of that. The other exams, what he worried about most was surgery. He had been an academic, so that most other things to do with medicine, even if they weren\u2122t his field, he would know. And as he said, he turned lucky in that, because the guy who was the examiner in surgery, was one of the first people to do color \u0152 cardiovascular surgery, to think about that. And he had read some articles of my father\u2122s as a cardiologist, and so knew who he was. And he said to him, I must give you a real surgical question. It was an appendectomy, which even my father could handle. And then he said, now let\u2122s talk about interesting things, the future of cardiovascular surgery. So he passed that. And so he passed, flying colors, before the end of December, so that in January, when we came to New Haven , he had his New York license."

I mean, we had a \u0152 my parents had a very, very hard time making it here. Ultimately they did. Ultimately my father became a full professor. Ultimately they were recognized in their fields, but they had a very, very hard time. And I sometimes thought we were outsiders and felt like this, because they were having a hard time. I don\u2122t think that\u2122s true, and my example of that is Hanna Gray , who became president \u0152 provost at Yale , president of Chicago . Was a couple of years ahead of me, at this same school. Oh, by the way, this English headmistress was delighted that she had people who were Italian Jewish, and so on, because she was somebody who wanted that, and so on. When Hanna was provost, and we were friends, because of \u0152 they were at dinner \u0152 lunch at our house once, and I said \u0152 we Interview with Guido Calabresi July 27, 2017 118 were talking about the experience coming, and I said, but of course, it was very different for you, because her mother was Jewish, her father was a great German historian, whose chair at Heidelberg was paid for by the Rockefeller , had been given by the Rockefeller in 1930s. Because his wife was Jewish, they decided to leave, and Rockefeller found \u0152 whether it was the Rockefellers or a foundation, said to American universities, whichever one of you wants [indecipherable] Hajo Holborn was his name, we will give the chair \u0152 move the chair there. And he wasn\u2122t Jewish, so Yale was perfectly willing to have him an-and it was a great, great story, and so the chair was here, and the \u0152 and so I said to Hanna , I expect your experience was very different from ours, because you came, and your father was a full professor already, with his chair and that, so on, and \u0152 and she looked at me, and she said, you\u2122re absolutely wrong. And she described her feelings, and her family\u2122s feelings of being outsiders, in exactly the same way. Because it was that just this sense of there you were somebody, here you are nobody. And this is \u0152 it\u2122s odd. Bob Dahl , the great political scientist, wrote a book called \ufb01 Who Governs ?\ufb02 in which one of the things that he does, is talk about who are the social elite, the political elite, the financial elite, the academic elite in a town. And in New Haven , he defines these in good political scientist terms [indecipherable] . Financial elite, anybody who is on the board of directors of any one of different companies. Interview with Guido Calabresi July 27, 2017 119 Political elite, anybody who is [indecipherable] certain positions , selectman , or whatever, or selectmen in towns and \u0152 and things of that sort. Fine \u0152 social elite, anybody who goes to what used to be the debutante ball in New Haven , a big dance. And academic elite, anybody who\u2122s full professor. Finds only one person who is all four. Me. The outsider. Nice irony. Why all four? Well, academic elite, easy. Political elite, at some point the town of Woodbridge wants to ask me to run as a \u0152 for selectman. Democrats don\u2122t win, but there is minority representation, you have to have a certain number of things. I\u2122m not particularly interested, I\u2122m saying I\u2122m in Europe on sabbatical, but if you put my name down, they need a name. There are Italian Americans living in Woodbridge who always vote republic, because the Irish are democratic. They know an Italian name, vote for it. Why didn\u2122t the democrats do that before? Because if you do that, all the Yale people, and the Jewish psychiatrists and so on, wouldn\u2122t vote for that one. For me, of course, they all vote. So, easy, I somehow get elected and spend some years doing that. Financial elite, they\u2122re looking for somebody, two parts of a bank are fighting with each other. They\u2122ve never had an Italian on the bank. Compromise, let\u2122s not fight, let\u2122s put somebody who\u2122s totally an outsider on the bank. So I end up being a bank director, because I was a full professor, young and Italian, ever looking for a bank. And social elite, yeah. All the people who get asked by girls who are coming Interview with Guido Calabresi July 27, 2017 120 out, to be their escorts, then get asked to this dance. And since my friends in school were the ones who were \u0152 so \u0152 and yet I\u2122m an outsider in all of them."

And everybody\u2122s desperate, but there\u2122s nothing to be done about it.

I say to my mother years later, when my mother says, you know, I\u2122d wanted to do two things in my life. Three Interview with Guido Calabresi July 27, 2017 129 things. Teach, write and look after my family. Because I wasn\u2122t in a research university, I could only do two at a time, and she taught and looked after her family. When she retired \u0152 actually, after the war, she \u0152 Yale is still closed to her, she moves from Connecticut College, to Albertus Magnus , a Catholic college here, because it\u2122s right nearby, and it\u2122s not as fancy. We don\u2122t need it as a backup any more, but she continues to teach. When she retires, she starts to write, and she writes \u0152 well, a book that she wrote in French. We found a letter from the head of the \u00c9cole de France when she died suddenly in Italy, saying from now on Reynaud (ph) scholarship begins with you, so she was able to do that. But I asked her why they didn\u2122t both leave and go to a research university. And I said, is it because in those days, women followed men? And Papa was here, and he wanted to stay here. And she laughed and she said, oh no. What happened was that when this happened, your father was furious, and wanted to leave."
