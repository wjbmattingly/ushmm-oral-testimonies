Even before I went into the Army, we had gotten rumors of that, things like that happening, but nobody was really sure, you know. There was no everything was kept quiet. So when we got into Germany, of course, it was a matter of just getting through and fighting and going through these battles.

What I saw was on my left, was a mass of dead bodies piled about eight feet high, and stretching out maybe 30 or 40 yards. The bodies had been soaked kerosene, ready to be burnt, but I guess we arrived too soon for them to do it. On my right, there were several people that were lying there, and some of them were crawling. Some weighed 80 pounds. Some looked half dead to me. One of them was crawling towards me, and I said something in Yiddish. I can't remember for sure, but \"Vus Kenneth Tuin Zick Sehelthen, (ph)\" and one of them came up and tried to kiss my feet. The feeling of helplessness and not believing was very prevalent. The gentile soldiers who were with me were almost in tears and shaking their heads. And I remember one of the survivors coming up and telling me that the Polish SS had run out the back of the camp, and they were getting away. And then later, one of the our soldiers, who had gone back there, said that two of them had been caught by some of the inmates and killed. The scene that I described to you has never left my memory. And when I hear some of these groups that are now prevalent in the United States, around the world, that say that this never happened, this really prevailed on me to tell what I saw, because I will never forget it. We left this area soon after. I guess we had another assignment. And it was a long time ago, 50 years or so. I don't remember what that assignment was between you and me. But that scene that I saw at the entrance will never be forgotten, and I felt that I had to describe it."

And so that was really probably the exact date that Buchenwald was liberated. Because the fact that the SS troops that were still there, and they had tried to, you know, get rid of that evidence, so it was not more than one or two days difference."

I think we came from Spain, and then to Poland, and so I remember stories about, you know, great, great, great grandfather being Rabbis and so on. So I've always felt Jewish. I don't think it had any affect on it. But it sure opened my eyes about what had been going on, and why, and why this happened was a big question; why it was allowed to happen. Because I think now as we read books and go back into history that many people knew what was going on, and nothing not enough was done to save these people."

That was it. So I don't know what happened in Dachau, for example, or others. Just what I saw in Buchenwald. One thing I do remember is that upon entrance into Buchenwald, not only was it the visual horror, but we had that terrible odor of dead bodies and kerosene, and it was it was an odor that made us all nauseous.

He happened to be a jeweler who came to our house to show a small, little charm bracelet that we were trying thinking of getting for our twoyear old daughter at the time. Now, this was over 30 years ago. But when he had heard that I went into the camp and was a liberator, he said you know, I was a survivor of Buchenwald, too. And the only way I survived was I finally cut off some toes in order to get to a hospital. And he was very emotional. We hugged, and he cried. And he said you, you saved us.
