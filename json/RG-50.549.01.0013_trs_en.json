            "answer": "Well the liberation, the Normandy landing was of course June 6, 1944, but where we were, in southeastern France, we were not liberated until the middle, August 15th, because we were liberated by Navy coming in from the Mediterranean. And that period between Normandy landing and that time that we were actually liberated was a very difficult one because the German troops were being pushed back by the troops in Normandy and they went on a rampage and burning towns and taking hostages, so actually, that period, that interim period between the two liberations, exact, almost the most dangerous one for us. We had originally found out about the Normandy landing on the BBC, but then the, when we actually liberated, in August, we just found Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 2 [Date not labeled] Page 2 out somehow, | don't really exactly know how we found out, but we, the troops came, the French troops and told us that we were free."

But then at this point, | need, we needed help. | did not have any clothes, all the clothes that | had, | had outgrown. And somehow, a social worker from the organization called OZSOE, which in French is called Organization enfant and it's a Jewish agency to help children and they got some clothes to me and they also arranged for me to attend a high school in a nearby town of Antsee(ph) and since it was too far for me to commute, they arranged to board me with a Jewish family in town, so | stayed with the family and went to the College Technique and Moderne and it would have been about sixth grade.

            "answer": "No, no, they remained up on the mountaintop and | was all by myself and then sometimes I'd come home on the weekend. But! was very unhappy in school and in boarding with strangers because | had actually never been separated from my parents. And! was homesick and | was crying all the time and it just wasn't working out. So we finally, my father had gone ahead and finally found us one room, just very, very primitive and we went back to Paris and when we left the priest, though, | had kind of made a vow to myself that someday | wanted the world to know what he had done forus. And that wish didn't get fulfilled until 1987, when I, | found out about the and recommended him and finally got the designation of the the nations and a medal which was posthumously awarded, because he died in 1959, but in that way | felt that he had gotten the recognition that he deserved, but at the point, you know, in 1945, | didn't know, | just knew that | wanted people to know, but | didn't know anything about, didn't exist then. So we went back to Paris and we found that circumstances were really very bad because even though the war was over, everything was devastated, there was no coal to heat apartments with. There was very little food and so our circumstances didn't appreciably improve when we went back to Paris. We were not sure what to do at this point, but my parents gave me a choice, because they felt that | was still so young, just barely 14 and 15 and | had my whole life in front of me Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 4 [Date not labeled] Page 4 and | should decide whether we should remain in France or whether we should go to the United States. And | had this very romantic idea, the United States, by that time | had seen a couple of war movies and | just, you know, | had thought everything American was just wonderful so | said, \"| want to go the United States.\" And so we had to put our name on a list and they had a quota and we had to wait until our name reached the top the list and that took two years. So we actually didn't get to leave until 1948. In the meantime we were in Paris and | became ill because you know, lack of nourishment and you know, being run down from the war and | contracted pleurisy and | was very ill for three months. There were no, of course no antibiotics in those days and | was, there was not much help available and it just took me forever to recover from that illness and | had to stay in bed for three months and then when it was over | found out | had lost the ability to walk, | was so weak my legs just wouldn't, wouldn't cooperate and my parents had to support me and | had to learn to walk all over again."

And so, by some miracle, | got over this very dangerous illness and then my father had found a job working for some movie company because before the war he worked for MGM and Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 9) [Date not labeled] Page 5 he was writing subtitles, German subtitles for American movies. And somehow, | don't know exactly who was involved, but he had gotten a contract for one year and we were actually able to go to the French Riviera and live there for a year in a villa. And well he did whatever it was that he was supposed to do and that probably was one of the happiest years of my life, because we were living in a gorgeous place and my health improved and that was a very good time for me. And we had met another couple who had been in Auschwitz and they still had the numbers tattoo and they had met there and they were just a few years older, so they were friends that remained when we came to New York. And then after a year we went back to Paris and went through another year there and | didn't do much of anything cause couldn't figure out quite, you Know, we were going to leave anyway, there was no point in my doing anything else."

But as young as | was, all these years you know and even in Vienna was a very little girl, | had an awareness of the existence of God and | don't know how because nobody told me because my parents had a tendency to kind of downplay it and say oh well, you know, it's all myth.

            "question": "So at this time, when you were still in France, you still didn't have any real religion?",
            "answer": "No, nothing, | didn't, you know, | mean here we were supposedly Jewish but my parents had been so assimilated into the dominant culture in Austria that they considered themselves Austrian and not really Jewish at all. Asa matter of fact they were almost anti-Jewish because they had formally left the Jewish religion, you know, you can do that and it was just because they were, you know, my father considered Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 7 [Date not labeled] Page 7 himself to be an intellectual and they just did not believe in anything. And so | didn't know anything about the religion of my ancestors. My grandparents weren't that observant, although probably more than my parents were, but each generation was more observant and that was the irony, that we were persecuted for a faith that we really didn't believe in. But the Nazis didn't make such distinctions. | didn't know anything about Judaism, | didn't know anything about Christianity, | didn't know anything about anything. So, you know, we were told that our name had reached the top of the quota and we had, we have to have a sponsor on this country. Somebody who, in America, somebody who would make sure that you didn't go on welfare when you came here and so. And my uncle and aunt on, my mother's brother and his wife had managed to escape the war and go to America and my uncle was a doctor and he was doing quite well, they were settled and so they said they would sponsor us and so we were able to leave and we had to go by boat and it took nine days to get over there and | remember that we were all deathly ill, | didn't eat anything for nine days, | was terribly seasick and we finally, finally landed in New York on my, in 1948, May, 1948, | was just about 17 and a half at the time and my uncle and aunt were there at the port to meet us and my aunt's first words to us were, \"| didn't really want you to come.\" Because she was that kind of person, she very much, you know her, she did because her husband said, \"Well this my sister and her family, we have to.\" But we were always, as far as they were concerned, the poor relations and she didn't have much respect for us and she didn't want us to come. So this is how we were greeted after Holocaust and all we went through and not only Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 8 [Date not labeled] Page 8 that but they had a lovely home in Queens, New York, but they didn't put us, they didn't take us there, they took us to a shelter run by the Hius(ph), which was the Hebrew Immigrant Society, downtown New York and so we spent our first night in the new country in a shelter with hundreds of other people on cots. It was not a very good first impression. And then, somehow, my father found us a place to live, just a, you know, a room somewhere and that's how we started. But my aunt was so afraid that, you know, we'd wind up costing her money that she got my mother and me a job in a factory and it was a real sweatshop downtown. It was some friend of hers was owning a factory and, it was a bead factory and we were made to string beads all day long, you know, that kind of thing. It was just horrible and it was very hot. It was May and it was very hot. So this, we were just kind of, is this America? We had this glorified picture and it just didn't turn out at all the way we thought it would be. And my mother and | didn't last very long in the factory. We were fired because we didn't work fast enough. And so we lasted only about two, three days and that was the end of that and then we found a place to live, it was, what in those days they call a railroad apartment, on the very edge of Spanish Harlem, on 98th, East 98th Street. And they were just, you know, one room going to another and it was very primitive, we didn't have any furniture and we went, remember we went to Goodwill Industries and got, just a few pieced of furniture and my father had a really hard time getting work. You know, he was in his 50's and he spoke English somewhat but you know, when you first come here and you're immigrant, nobody's going to hire you and he had to, for a first, | don't know how long, but he, he washed Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 9 [Date not labeled] Page 9 dishes, he did all those things, you know, just to get some money so we could survive. And the other thing was, you know, as far as | was concerned, | did not speak English. And English is now my third language because | had to learn French first, when we came to France. And so | didn't speak a word of English and yet | knew that it was very important for me to learn if | was ever going to get some work. And! wound up really supporting the family, but | guess | have a, you know, it's easy for me to learn languages and | did learn pretty quickly. So it wasn't that big a problem for me to, to learn a language. And then things got kind of bad because my mother became very ill. She was only in her 50's and she had a stroke, which left her permanently disabled. She had contracted TB during World War 1. And then from that she got a rheumatic heart, so her heart was not very good and she was just a tiny little woman, she was five feet and the most she ever weighed in her life was 90 pounds. And she had the stroke and so she was almost unable to, one side was paralyzed and she had trouble walking, so she was more or less homebound after that."

And she was never one to feel sorry for herself, she always, you know, managed to ___ herself and you know, keep herself neat. And she had interests, she read, she listened to the radio and she had a lot of friends, so she was very remarkable that way. But her life was just taken away from her basically, at that point. So really my father was still having a lot of problems getting work and it was up to me to support the family. And soon as | learned English, then | started, you know, getting, looking at the classifieds in the paper and | don't know why, to this day | don't know why, but | answered an ad for somebody who wanted a bookkeeper and I'd never done any bookkeeping and math was my worst subject. But | went and it was a company called Home Craftsman in downtown New York. It was a magazine for hobbyists, people who like to putter around, do jigsaws at home and do all those things. And for some inexplicable reason | was hired, but after a few days they realized that | was not a bookkeeper. And the boss said to me, | don't know what you did, you know, in your and of course | had fudged, it was a matter of survival. | didn't like having to do that but it was a matter of survival. | had to pretend that | had experience because | had Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 11 [Date not labeled] Page 11 to start somewhere. And somehow, | don't know if he felt sorry for me or what but they realized that, you know, | had not quite told the truth, but they kept me and they made me into a mail clerk and so for five years | opened mail, because they had a mail order business and I, and | just separated the orders in neat piles and count the money and the checks at the end of the day.

And there were certain places in New York where you couldn't live, because they didn't rent to Jews. And certain resorts where you couldn't go, that were not, that were, so | thought, \"Oh, you know, here | thought we left all this behind\" and a, so a strange thing happened at this point, | was really almost ashamed of having a Jewish background and so | didn't tell anybody. | told them | was French but | didn't tell them about my background of being a survivor or anything like that Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 12 [Date not labeled] Page 12 because the Germans had done such a good job of propagandizing and making you feel like you were the scum of that earth, that so, it is so insidious that after a while, you're being told, you know, over these years, you're scum, you're scum, you wind up believing. | said, \"Well maybe | am inferior, maybe I'm not good as anybody else.\" And so | just determined | wasn't going to tell people and you know.

So | worked at this job for five years and then when | felt confident enough, you know, with the English language and everything, | decided | was going to look for something better and | got a job with Kodak, corporation. | don't exactly remember what it was, but it was a step up in salary. | had started, I'd started at, the Home Craftsman and | remember it was 37 dollars a week | was making there.

People who had been my friends, my classmates outside of school and then suddenly they started calling me names, dirty Jew and they'd spit when | walked by and you know, to me a seven year old, was so hard to understand why kids would be that way, from one day to the next. Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 15 [Date not labeled] Page 15 Just because their parents were Nazi sympathizers and they told them, you know, you don't want to have anything to do with Jews.

And | remember that this was a terrible thing for my father, the day we got the news, the letter, he just walked out by himself into the woods and he stayed there for many hours because he felt he had to be alone with his thoughts and it was just, it was just a terrible, terrible experience.

They had, this was just before Thanksgiving, they had a dance and | met him there. And that was in November of 1958. And his story was just so totally different from mine, | mean, we, we had come really, literally from the ends of the world, opposite ends of the world and met. It was very, very strange. He had, his name was William. Bill, we called him Bill and he had been raised in the Philippine Islands, he was actually born in San Francisco but he was raised in the Philippines because his father was an officer in the army there. He was a lieutenant colonel in the Philippine Scouts, he was in charge of native troops there in the Philippines, you know and this the time of MacArthur and so on, Eisenhower ; And so my husband had a sister who was a year older, his mother and father all lived in the Philippines and he lived there until Pearl Harbor, he was about 17 at the time. And then when, at Pearl Harbor the family was evacuated back to the States, mother had a, was originally from Kansas, she was from Wichita and so my husband, my Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 21 [Date not labeled] Page 21 future husband and his sister and mother came back to the United States while his father remained in the Philippines and then later the family got word that he had been made prisoner of war of the Japanese and he wound up dying in Japanese prison of war camp.

And then when they went back to Wichita he, he joined the service, he went in first in the Army Air Corps and then in the Marines, he kept enlisting, just so that, you know, he just wanted to do something for his country and he wanted to get away from this, you know, memory of this father, you know, he didn't want to deal with it. And then somehow he wound up in, in New York City where, where we met. But his family were as WASP as you can get. His father had traced an ancestor who had actually come over on the Mayflower. They were, you know, Episcopalian, Republicans and very anti-Semitic, because of one incident in the camp, one Jewish officer they'd had some fight with and they decide all Jewish people were bad, so he had come from this environment but then, he inherited some money from when his mother died in 50's, in Wichita and he was able to travel around the world, literally around the world and he was able to broaden his mind and to meet all different cultures and, and then he just shed all those prejudices that he had when he was younger so by the time he met me, you know, he didn't have any prejudice and he went to the Unitarian place because he thought, well he was very liberal, by that time he'd become liberal in his politics and soon. This is the place to be. But you know, | was afraid to tell him about my background because here was a man that | really cared about and | was afraid again that if he'd found out | was Jewish he Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 22 [Date not labeled] Page 22 would drop me like a hot potato, so | didn't say anything.

So | was coming out of depression and, but then, you know, my legs had swelled up terribly when | was in hospital, he had never caught it. And so when they thought | could take it, they told me that | had a deep venous thrombosis, which is a blood clot in my leg and they were so afraid it was going to go to my lung, so | had to be, remain the hospital although the depression was waning and | would have been able, but | was immobilized for another three weeks and given blood clot dissolvers and, and then, if that wasn't enough, then the doctor came to me one day and then kept taking blood and | thought, why are they taking so much blood and the doctor said | had a hemolytic anemia and | didn't know what that was, but two of my uncles on my mother's side had died of leukemia when they were in their 30's and | was absolutely sure that's what | had and they weren't telling me the truth. So | said, \"Is it leukemia?\" No, but they said it's a disease that causes the destruction of red blood cells, there was no, it was either acquired or inherited and there was no cure. So| thought, fine, you know, this is great. Got a blood clot, | got a fatal disease, this is just what | needed, you know. And so at this point | said, okay, is the first time | think | said, \"All right, | am not in control,\" and | talked to God, really and | said, \"I'm put myself in your hands and do what you will, |, you know | mainly, | give up, it's your turn.\" And so they kept taking blood and then one day they came in they were shaking their heads, they said, we can't understand it, because your blood pictures is returning to normal. Your red cells are increasing and we don't know why. They just couldn't understand. And after a week | got well enough to leave and they Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 45 [Date not labeled] Page 45 wanted me to come back and have blood tests, you know, to make sure, because they, they thought oh, this is a fluke and | came back a month later and there was no evidence of the disease, it was gone. And meanwhile, | had to have follow up for the blood clot, you know, here in Lawrence, but that was, that was okay, and eventually that was kind of all right and then they wanted me to have follow up therapy, psycho-therapy for the depression and | went a couple times and | thought, \"| don't need this, I'm fine.\" You know?

So it was a very, very difficult time and | had to you know, cope with the whole thing, cause he was totally, | had to take over all the finances, all the managing the household. He had been driving when we first came here and then | realized that he couldn't drive any more, it was too dangerous. But | didn't drive because we never had to have a car in New York City and so at age 56, | had to take driving lessons and passed and got my license and started driving, which was, you know, it took a lot of courage for me to do this because | was really scared, but something strange happened when | left the Med Center in 1986. First of all | decided, | don't Know what happened actually, something happened there, but all my priorities changed. All the things that had seemed so important to me before, you know, exterior things, appearance, whatever, what people thought of me, this didn't matter any more, it was a total reversal of priorities. All | thought was what really mattered now was to make my life count for something, cause | didn't know at that point, you know, how much time | had left, but | decided that | would conquer my inner demons my own way and | would be successful at it. And so | wrote some rules for myself and | even pasted it on the mirror in my bedroom and it said, whatever these difficult tasks that | had to do, I'll say, | can do it, | must do it, | will do it. And this helped me enormously when | had to take driving lessons, | was scared stiff and | had to pass the test, but | did that. Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 47 [Date not labeled] Page 47 Then, when we first, when | first came out of the hospital in '86 in Lawrence, | suddenly found that | had acquired a fear of going, agoraphobia, fear of going outside because probably because | had been cooped up in hospitals for so long and | had this absolute fear of going outside and, even you know, just in front of the house and if my husband was still driving at that time and we'd go to a supermarket and | would cling to him and | would beg him not to leave me because | would be absolutely panic stricken, so this was this lingering thing, but it was a new thing which | never had before, which | had to conquer. So | decided that | wasn't going to be, you know, home bound and because of this and so | decided | would go down, because we lived on the third floor, | would go downstairs and | would set a goal, | would walk as far as the street and then boy if | could do that, that was fine. Then the next day | set a goal that was a little farther. And so little by little, over a period of some weeks, | got to the point where | could walk to a supermarket, which was about a half a mile each way, to my house and when | could do that, then | Knew I'd gotten over my phobia and | would be fine, but..."

And it was, | guess in a way, | had to take over the finance as | said and | guess in a way it was a good thing because when he died, | was just totally, you know, at a lost, know what to do, | mean | had prepared myself psychologically for this event, cause the doctor had told me at one point he had six months to live because his liver's going and exactly six months later he was dead.

And so over the years | built up a, you know, a membership and it's been going since, oh 1987, we have two classes that meet regularly at the, French classes. | had German classes on and off, but they didn't take off as well as the French classes, but all told | had about 15 people Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 49 [Date not labeled] Page 49 and they'll be University, retired University professors from all, people really from all walks of life, but it's been, this has been my salvation, to, to have this and to get back into teaching again, which is what | really liked best of all, of all the jobs I've had."

And my husband went for awhile, but not very long, he got tired of that and he wouldn't go and | went by myself. Made some friends there and slowly | started telling them about my background again, you know, during the Holocaust and | was a little leery because, in the midwest, you know, | always, you had this feeling, misconception that people are narrow minded and you know, you know, | was still afraid of rejection and discrimination but | found that people were so interested because in New York, Holocaust survivors are a dime a dozen, but here really, they don't have this access and | found out that they were very interested. And so this encouraged me and so at the fellowship on Sunday, they have programs on Sunday mornings, they have outside speakers and speakers from their own group and so they encouraged me to give atalk. And this is the very first time that | talked publicly about what happened. Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 50 [Date not labeled] Page 50 And it was a great success and of course | was very nervous, I've never done, and there's another thing that | had. | had of course, terrible stage fright all my life, even just on the, in very small groups, if | had to get up in a group of four people and make a brief announcement, | was just, my knee turned to jelly and so | thought, oh, you know, how can | face all these people? And then again, | put this thing to work and | said, | have to do it and I'm going to conquer this and | made up my mind | wasn't going to be afraid and then | wasn't. And from the first talk after that, | could go up there and it wouldn't matter whether there were 500 people, 100, | was not scared any more. And some people heard me, local teachers and they ask me to speak to their students and so | built up a reputation, it was all word of mouth and at times | myself went out and contacted different groups, primarily church groups and other organizations and little by little, you know, | acquired a reputation as a Holocaust speaker and now I've been doing this since basically 1987 and to date I've kept a log but | haven't really added it up but at last count, which was last year, I'd given over 130 talks. And now | concentrate primarily on children from grades six to 12 and I'm, you know, a registered speaker with the, our local school system, | go to all the secondary schools and | also get calls from vicinities outside of Lawrence, you know, in the state of Kansas. And | have, | have written the book that | had written during the war, which is translated into English, | had given to every, copies to every secondary school in Lawrence, so that the kids can access it in the public library as well.

            "answer": "This is about, it's called Childhood Memoirs of World War 2, and as | said, it's from a diary | kept as a child when | was 14 and eventually translated to English so that my husband and my friend here could read it. And | have found that, of course I've gotten other invitations from civic groups, church groups, just a variety of groups and I've always been amazed how great the desire for knowledge is, cause people really know very little about what happened during that period. And how warmly | am received and | have hundreds and hundreds of letters from school children, handwritten little notes to say how much they appreciated my talking and it's been my raison d'\u00e9tre. \\It's been a catharsis for me and | have, you know, my speech totally memorized, never refer to notes, | have visuals, | collect things out of the paper, anything having to do with the Holocaust and | keep adding to that. And so | feel that, you know, because before | was ashamed to speak and now I'm, I'm kind of, you know, making up for that and | always tell people when | give the talks that there are some reasons why | do this, because sometimes people say, you know, \"Why do you do this?\" And why you put, they think it's really difficult for me and emotional and | said, \"Well, in the beginning it was, but after awhile you manage to get a certain distance, emotional distance from your subject, because if | were emotionally, you know, involved, every time | give a talk, | couldn't do it. And so I've had to learn to disassociate myself as though it were really not my story, it's the only way I, | can do Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 52 [Date not labeled] Page 52 it. And | found out that's a coping mechanism that you learn instinctively during the war is you kind of put away things that you don't want to deal with and that's a self- preservation thing. So | tell them there are three reasons why | give this talk, is, one is to keep alive the memory of the six million victims of Hitler, including my grandparents. And two is to counter the, the revisionist lies of people who would say that, you know, there was no Holocaust, oh it was exaggerated, it wasn't as bad and then third is so it wouldn't ever happen again and in the end | ask the kids, | said, \"| need your help in keeping the story alive, because we are called the last witnesses and my fear is that once, once we're gone, my generation, there won't be anyone left to keep the story alive, so I'm counting on you.\" And, and you know, I've gotten these darling little letters, they said, \"Don't worry Mrs. Edmands, we won't ever forget you, what you said,\" and you know, it was very, very, very gratifying and I've never encountered any hostility, I've talked to all different kinds of groups and they've always been most friendly, there's never any hostile comments or anything like that. But the one wonderful experience | had, well one good experience was in 1990, when Father Longiree(ph), the priest who had really hidden us and saved our lives had been awarded the Medal of the Just, from Yahdvashem(ph) and then organizers in his hometown of Antsee(ph), which is the town closest to where his parish was, decided to have a commemorative ceremony for him and from some other priests who had helped people like us. And | was invited to the ceremonies, which were held in 1990, in May 1990 and | stayed with my friend there and it was just a wonderful, wonderful ceremony, they had dignitaries from Yahdvashem(ph), from Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 53 [Date not labeled] Page 53 Israel they had the Grand Rabbi of the region, they had priests and ministers and people from the French government and some 600 invited guests and | was able to again tell, talk, tell these people, in French this time, about the priest and what he had done for us and then since he had died, his medal was awarded to him posthumously and it was given to me and | asked that the medal be put in a glass case and put in his former church so that everybody would, would see it. So this was one of the high points. And then | found out about other priests and their heroic deeds and all the wonderful things they had done, so | came back with a whole collection of stories of just, you know, sheer heroism and what | was pointing out is, the heroes during World War 2 were not the generals, you know, and who won the war, like MacArthur and so on, because that was their job. It was the little people, the little people were the true heroes. And you, you met, you know, instances of altruism which you would never think possible. People risking their lives and their families lives to help strangers. At the risk of their own lives, see. So that was, that was just a unique experience. Then a year later, in 1991, | found out that there was a new organization formed called, for people who had been hidden as children during World War 2. Now there already have been organizations for Holocaust survivors and they've had regular meetings but they're mostly for people who had been in the camps. And we were a breed apart, and you know, and somebody finally recognized that, because and we were sort of a little bit disparaged by the people who'd been in camps, they say, \"Oh well, you know, you didn't go through what we did.\" And that's true. But, on the other hand, we had a very unique problems as Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 54 [Date not labeled] Page 54 children being hidden, having to live day after day with the terror of being discovered, being separated from your loved ones. It was situation all by itself and it deserved some recognition. So the Hidden Children was formed. They had the first international reunion of Hidden Children in New York City at the Marriott Hotel in 1991, three day and they had workshops and sessions. And they had originally expected some 500 people and 1600 showed up. From all, literally all parts of . People came from Australia, Poland, you know, Germany, Great Britain, just all over the world. And in addition to the former hidden children, they also had rescuers who came and for some, some were very, very elderly, some were on crutches or in wheelchairs and for some it was their very first reunion with the, the children that they had rescued, so it was very emotional. And | had, you know, | wanted to go, but | had mixed feelings about it. | thought | knew all there was to know about the Holocaust, | said, oh well, you Know. And |, | was afraid in a way, stirring up all those memories, cause | said okay | talk about it, that's fine, but emotionally I'm detached, why stir up this? But in the end, | went and | was so glad | did. Because the minute | walked in there, | suddenly, you know, here, | who had never been raised Jewish and now all these people, all Jewish and that was such a bond, there's just immediate bond. You felt that all these people, after just a few hours, that they were your brothers and sisters. It was the most wonderful feeling. A lot of them were my age, some were older. The age ranged from 50's to you know, /O0's and 80's. First woman | met there was a woman, | mean she was a prototype of an Aryan, she was blonde hair, blue eyes, porcelain skin, Jewish, had Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 95 [Date not labeled] Page 55 been abandoned, not really abandoned, but left by her mother in Poland when she was two years old. Her mother had dropped her on doorstep of a convent to save her and her mother didn't make it and she was raised by gentiles. And so she and | met and she was very, she still had a lot of bitterness towards, you know, the Germans and cause she had then somehow found, an uncle found her and she'd found her true roots and she moved to Arizona, married a Jewish man, now she's very active. But she was very, she had a lot of bitterness about, you know, German people and, and really not knowing that much about her background cause she was so young. But you know, there were just million stories there and we had some very inspirational speakers, we had Elie Wiesel(ph) and Serge Klaufeld(ph), the famous French Nazi hunter there. And then we had workshops, workshops and we had a list of things we could choose, for instance, the issue of guilt. People who felt guilty, as | did and then there were workshops for people who didn't know who they were, whether they were Christian or Jewish because they had been raised by Christians and they had this kind of schizophrenic attitude to weather. So | went to several of workshops and | was listening to the people talking and then | thought, this can't be, they're telling my story. And in so many instances the stories they told were so similar to mine, they were rescued by a priest, you know . [mean it was almost like they'd taken pages out of my book, | could not believe this, it was, it was spooky, you know, it was really spooky."

            "answer": "| moved into my house three years ago and it was the very first time that | had ever owned a house, we had always lived in apartments and it was a lifelong dream to own something that was really mine and to have a little garden and to grow stuff. | feel blessed in so many ways, cause |, | can truly say, | don't have, you know, that much money, | have a small pension to live on, but | can pay my mortgage and | can pay my bills and | feel blessed because | have everything now that | have ever wanted. | have peace of mind and | don't really have any worries, | take care of myself. My husband died in 1993 as | said and that was, that was a hard blow, but it wasn't unexpected because he had been so ill and he was just absolutely determined to kill himself. He had, he did have a death wish, which for reasons that, you know, | will never know and he was just absolutely determined to do away with himself. And, and | figure, well he finally got his wish and then, but | realized that life had to go one and so going on with my life and buying the house was, was the first step and | had already quite a circle of friends too, my volunteer work and to other organizations, so | just really kept doing what, what | was doing before, only now | Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 62 [Date not labeled] Page 62 didn't feel guilty about it for being away from home. And during the school year as | said, | give talks and | still volunteer at the public library and otherwise | keep busy. There's always housework to be done, garden work. | go, | take walks, | read a lot, I'm trying to learn more about history, especially during the pre-Nazi period to find out what happened, that what were the circumstances that led to the rise of Nazis in Germany. | have a lot of, lot of different interests, I've interest in linguistics and history, geology, so many different things, that I'll probably never be able in a lifetime to satisfy them all, but I'm fortunate that | have a nice library and it keeps me busy. And | try, you know, | take some trips. And, oh, one of the main things that | wanted to relate is | had a very unusual experience last year in October. | had, during the war, after we left Paris, in 1940 or so, we wound up in a little village in southern France, called Kalvisol(ph) and there we stayed for a year when my father was in the labor camp there and then, this was at the time, the free zone, the rest of France being occupied by Germany. And then when the Germans broke their pact with France to, to leave part of France free and occupied the southern zone, my father's life was again in danger. And so due to a local partisan pastor, who was also the town doctor, we were able to get away cause he had made a certificate saying my father had a dangerous illness and couldn't be moved and he also arranged for my family to get fake ID's that enabled us, with fake names that enabled us to finally leave this village and the rest is recorded, you know, what followed after that is recorded in the original video | made for the Holocaust Museum in Washington. But we had never, none of us had ever gone back, except for my father, he made a trip Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 63 [Date not labeled] Page 63 back to that little village and among other places, somewhere in the, you know, | don't know, 60's or so, I'm not sure, early 70's, but he went on his own. And he did see this pastor and his wife and then this pastor died at age 90 in 1974. So |, for my part, had lost all contact with the village. And then a strange thing happened, | had given a copy of my book to the people in the town of Antsee(ph). The Archbishop wanted a copy because you know, it was about a priest and so on and then the organizers of the commemorative ceremony for the priest, with whom | had become very good friends and we'd been corresponding and they had come and visit us here, SO we were really good friends by then. And they had lent my book to a friend of theirs who was a priest and of course, he knew Father Longiree(ph), but then, when he came to the chapter that dealt with the one year that we spent in southern France, the name of the town, Kavisol(ph) rang a bell. He said, \"Oh, | know that town, | know somebody who lives there.\" And you know, it was such a coincidence because of all the places in France it could have been, this particular one he knew. And it was just a tiny hamlet. And what happened, this man named Marcel Coulier(ph), was a young man during the war and he was hiding from, he didn't want, all young Frenchmen have to do forced labor in Germany and those who didn't want to do that went underground. And this priest that helped this young man hide, and they had stayed in contact and then many, many years later, you know this man had moved to Paris, gotten married and then in his retirement he came back to the town of Kalvisol(ph) and where he was living. And so this priest copied my chapter that dealt with our lives in southern France and send it to his friends, hey look you know, this Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 64 [Date not labeled] Page 64 talks about your town. And of course then, oh this is just extraordinary cause this friend shared it with, he had made some very good friends in the village and he shared it with all them. And they were just so thrilled, because not only here's somebody had written about their village, so long ago and they said everything was accurate, the names, everything was accurate in every detail. And of course they didn't know that their pastor had done all this cause he wasn't one to, to brag about it. So they were terribly excited and they got in contact with me and we started correspondence and we talked on the phone and it just so happened that just at the time when they discovered my existence in America, they were planning a ceremony for the pastor because there was a new part of town that was street that needed a name and so they decided to name the street after this pastor, so everything was in place and then they found out about me and what this pastor had done, which they didn't even know, you know. They just named the street because he was a good man and as doctor he had brought many of them to life, so they want to honor him, but they had no idea what he done during the war. So then of course they wanted me to come to the ceremony and there was just too short notice, you Know, amount. | said | can't, you know, | just can't pick up and go in April, in the middle of my busiest time. So | said, well | tell you what, they said, \"Well could you write something and we could read?\" So | said I'd do that. So | wrote a little soeech in French and mailed it to them and it was read at the ceremony and they had other dignitaries and of course they told the whole story. The newspaper picked it up and it was such a big deal and they send me the articles and it was almost comical because it said, Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 65 [Date not labeled] Page 65 \"Jewish girl, former resident of Kavisol(ph),\" you know, \"found living in America.\" So you know, | was like, ha, it was so funny, it was the biggest thing that ever happened to them, in that of the village, maybe. And so, and | was in contact basically with this one man who had been the organizer of the family and there were three families that were friends besides Marcel Coulier(ph) and his wife and then two other couples and they were, they had form an organization as the friends of Dr. Bonet(ph), which is the name of this pastor priest. So all my correspondence was with them and we just became really good friends and then | started remembering names of people I'd gone to school with. And | wrote it to them and he said, \"Yeah that's true and they remember you.\" You know, things started coming back. And then those darling people made a video tape, not only of the ceremony, where | could just watch myself where they, while they read the speech I'd written, but they made a videotape of the town and sort of going around and saying, this is school you went to and this is that abandoned house you lived in, it's always just wonderful. But then of course they kept putting the pressure on me, they wanted to meet me and | had to promise them that | would come, you know and visit them. And the following year | finally decided okay, it's now or nothing, you know. And | mean, they were so nice, you know, in letters so cordial, but | didn't know them. You know, you go to a strange place, you don't know anybody, | felt a little bit, but | said, \"This is something | have to do.\". Because | felt that | had honored the priest but there was still a page that had to be written in this book. It's closure, you know. So then | turned out that my friends in Antsee(ph), knew this other couple, the Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 66 [Date not labeled] Page 66 Couliers(ph), they had become friends and so my friend in Antsee(ph) said, \"If you come, come stay with us and then we will take you by car to this village.\" Cause otherwise | said, you know, \"How am | going to get there, it's like in the middle of nowhere.\" And so that's what | wound up doing and originally | just was planning when | planned my trip, | planned, you know, two or three days because | said, \"I don't Know these people.\" | didn't even know where | was going to stay. And then when | wrote my dates, they said, \"Oh, this will never do, this'll never do, you're going to have to stay with us for a week at least, cause we have all these plans.\" And you know, you have, so | had to change all my flights, everything. Finally went to Antsee(ph) and then they drove me there. | come there and the three family met me and | mean, | mean, | felt like a rock star. | mean, it was just the most wonderful welcome and it turned out that of the three couples, | Knew the husband and wife cause I'd gone to school with them. And then of course they called in the media, they had a reporter from a local paper come and interview me and they had more articles in the paper and | mean, this was big deal and they took me around and the next day to the village to show me all the places where I'd grown up and they were so thrilled, | mean they took more pleasure and maybe even more than | did, but it was weird for me to see it, abandoned house where my family had lived. And you know, it all looked really, basically, | mean it was upgraded, but you know, all these memories keep coming back, but they were not bad memories, you know, even though they were bad times, but it was just so good and to see the people that were so wonderful. And then they had, when | first and | stayed with one of the couples Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 67 [Date not labeled] Page 67 and my goodness, | had a whole, practically a whole house to myself, my own quarters, they were pretty well off, you Know it was wonderful. And then the first day | was there he pulled out a long list of things and complete, complete schedule, itinerary. Every day, every hour planned, what they were going to do with me. And they had realized that when | lived there during the war, you know, | didn't have time, | mean there was no time to go sightseeing and there are a lot of beautiful things, so they determined they're going to take me to the seashore, they're going to take me to the mountain, surrounding towns, you know, the whole bit. So in one week we were constantly on the way, we got in the van in the morning, came home at night and just went all around the countryside and | saw all these things | just had heard about and they were just, | mean of course, | was totally their guest, never pay a cent for anything and | got charming gifts, | couldn't go to a gift shop they want to buy me everything in the store. It was, it was so wonderful and then they had organized two ceremonies, one was at the little, little village where my father had been in the labor camp. There was an official reception at City Hall, | was received by the mayor, speeches, you know, the whole bit. And then there was another ceremonies, very similar one, in that little village itself. Again with the mayor, the City Council, the whole bit, you know, the people coming up to me and | got a medal. And | gota plaque and flowers and oh! And | kept saying to them, | don't know why they're doing all this, | didn't do anything to deserve this, all | did was live there for a year. And they said, \"Oh, but you don't understand.\" And then you know, sort of talking to people later, it came to me that it was more about them than it was about me. It Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 68 [Date not labeled] Page 68 made them feel good. It showed them that there had been good people in their town, because you see, anyone of them, they knew we were living there, anyone of them could have denounced us and nobody talked, which is remarkable. Nobody talked. And | guess that made them feel good and it made them and some of them were too young to even remember the war and they learned something and they actually met somebody, you know, who had lived among them and it was just a great experience for them and forme. So it was just probably the most, the best experience of my life."

People had hope. We, we, | think everybody felt that all things were possible and this, you know, after all | have to realize | grew up, so to speak, you know, my late teens and early 20's is during the 50's and that is the period which is now idealized almost in movies and so on, you know, where people could still have Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 76 [Date not labeled] Page 76 their own home and live better than their parents did, it was...[end of side 1 of tape 3]...the political picture was just totally different because the economy was on the upswing and you know, take myself as just an example. As little education | had and little training in business, | was always able to get a job, which would never be the case now, you know, | was never, never without a job and we had anything in those days, you know, we had, what | consider leaders, people that were figures, you know, Roosevelt. Roosevelt was so loved in France, | remember right after the war, | was in the school in Antsee(ph) and teacher came in, tears streaming down her face and said, \"Children | just have terrible news, President Roosevelt died.\" And here we were in this little town in France and everybody burst out crying, that's how loved he was. Even Truman, you know, there, there, there are leaders that we felt had basic integrity and which is, you know, today I'm becoming more apolitical, but | have to say this, that wnen we came to New York in '48, we immediately, you know, we got our first papers and then we had to wait five years to be American citizens and we really, you know, first opportunity, we became citizens and | remember we had this mass ceremony in Yankee Stadium and it was just a wonderful experience, we felt so proud to be Americans and the first time | was able to vote, | voted and | registered democrat and I've been really a lifelong democrat. | worked on Adlai Stevenson's campaign, but it was | couldn't vote then cause | wasn't citizen. But as | got involved early on, | was married to somebody who was really very liberal, hated the war in Vietnam, hated direction our country was going and | think | absorbed some of that. And today really, I'm, I'm awfully proud to be an American, | even Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 77 [Date not labeled] Page 77 wrote a letter to the editor which was published, saying that |, I'm distressed at the seeming decline in patriotism, it used to be on the Fourth of July everybody would have a flag out. Now you know, you can go to entire neighborhoods, not ever see a single flag and | always, you know, to me it's such a wonderful privilege to be able to put my flag out on a holiday. And another one is people, you know, don't bother to vote, there's a certain amount of apathy and for me, it is, after having lived under a dictatorship for so long, it's a great privilege for me to be able to participate in the democratic process. And | also have a great debt of gratitude to the, to the heroic Americans who died, fought and died so that people like me could be free. I'll never forget that, | have had the privilege of meeting some World War 2 veterans, some who were in Normandy and | was able to thank them personally, you know, for what they did for me. And |, I, I've always loved, unabashedly, you know, it's just | love America, | love America with all my heart and soul because | felt that it gave us a chance to start our lives afresh and it welcomed us when no other country would really do so. And, you know, | can never forget this and so when | do give talks in schools, | tell the kids how important their American citizenship is and why they should always cherish it, protect it and defend it.

You have no idea, it's still, you know, America has a lot of faults, but it's still, | think, the greatest country in the world and when you have lived, you know, under those terrible dictatorships, you really get to appreciate it, you Know and you have to, you know, this is it, for better or for worse and we could, | don't think that any, any presidential Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Eva Edmands 78 [Date not labeled] Page 78 candidates today, running in '96 are especially inspirational and | think politics have taken a very negative turn, very nasty turn and | do feel turn off, I'll probably still vote, but I, at this time, | don't know who for, but I'm, I'm discouraged at the, at the direction the country's going with the decline in the family structures, the rising crime, the, and just, the senselessness of some, you know, crimes that are committed, just for the sheer heck of it, it's, I'm not optimistic about the future of this country and at times | think that I'm grateful that we didn't have children, because | would be extremely worried about their future, and not only economically, but drug scene and AIDS and all these things which, you know, we really didn't have to deal with when | was young."
