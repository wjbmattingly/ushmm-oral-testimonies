There were multiple contacts between the two islands \u0152 visits and so on. So I can say I grew up on both islands. We took many trips between them. In Kos, I studied until age 11. Then, until age 17, I went to school in Rhodes, but had to stop in 1938 because of the racial laws."

There were Turkish people, and there were Greek people that had been there for many, many years and genera tions. In Turkey, at the end of the time of the Sultan, when he chased them from Turkey, they sent away all the Greek people as well. So some of them came to the islands and so we\u0160 although we were Greek, we had a lot of Turkish traditions in our daily life \u0152 in our cooking, and even some of the words, to the point that my mother knew some of the Turk ish words but she thought they had always been Greek words \u0152 all Greek words.

When the Italians came, they sent two groups of officers \u0152 Italian m ilitary \u0152 at some point in time. But we never felt anything because the Italians always behaved ve ry well toward us. I said before that we were not supposed to go to school when the racial laws started, but the Italians were very apologetic to us. They told us that those were the rules that they had received and unfortunately they had to apply them at some point in time. Not at the be ginning, but at some point they were obliged to. And also some of the Jews belonged to clubs \u0152 you know, an Italian circle of clubs, and we were excluded from them at that time also. But the It alians were again apologetic about that. They said they were obliged to do it because of some rules they ha d received from the mainland. Generally, we had normal life even after racial laws."

And the Italian behavior stayed the same. It\u2122s only after the attempt on Hitler\u2122s life, that things got tougher because of the Germans. That was on July 20, 1944."

            "question": "I think I forgot my question. I think I understand that it wasn\u2122t a drastic change of lifestyle when the racial laws were implemented. Howe ver, I\u2122m wondering if you and your family, or others in the Jewish community were talking about this and very concerned about this.",
            "answer": "We had news, in some of the Italian newspa pers, but since it was so far away, we thought, you know, we were not concerned. We were very isolated in the islands and even the attitude of the Italian officers was very relaxed, so we wouldn\u2122t think that somethi ng was really happening to us. That\u2122s why we were not as concerned. The situation worsened when Badoglio, who was marshal in the Ita lian army, and the king, Vittorio Emmanuel the Third, when they asked for the armistice with the Allies. And at that time, things got a little tougher. At that time, when the Germans saw that the Italia ns were asking for the armistice and they got it, they felt they were betrayed by the Italians. At that point in time, they sent some troops to the islands. It was only nine months before our eventual deportation that at so me point in time the Germans, after seeing what the Italians did, sent more tr oops to the islands. But the local population was not aware of anything, and even the Germans that were on the island were acting very normal and polite with all the population. We did not know, but in the meantime, they had taken all the information on Jewish families. They took all the addresses and knew who was living where and they already had all the information on Jews. They were not showing anything, but they had already started. German troops came to Rhodes on September 8, 1943. At some point, after the armistice, the Germans had their headquarters in Rhodes. And at that point, they called all the Italian officers and told them, \ufb01Your king a nd the Marshal Badoglio have asked for armistice, so what are you going to do?\ufb02 And at that point, the Germans told the Italian officers that they were German prisoners. But the officers stayed on the island. They were not supposed to leave the island, but they were not put as a military officer in prison, they were just free to stay on the island at that time. Therefore, the Jews were registered, but we knew nothing about what was going on in Europe. At the moment of the armistice, when the British saw that the Italians were joining the Allies, they tried to land in Kos. But the Germans ha d sent some boats from Rhodes to bomb them. And then the British tried to land in Rhodes, but they couldn\u2122t succeed, so they had to retreat. And so we stayed. And the Jewish population and the rest of the population stayed in Kos. The Italians didn\u2122t say anything and maybe didn\u2122t know anything about the plans of the Germans, but at some point, the Germans that were on the is lands of course, told the population of Kos that if they wanted to leave, they could leave. This was because we were going to run out of food because the island was kind of isolated. It was surrounded by the British submarines, and we had difficulty finding food. So they had asked the population of Kos if any of us wanted to leave the island and go to Turkey."

And then, unfortunately, I feel bad about the ignorance, but we had no more radios, but more than that\u0160 that was not an excuse, but more than that it\u2122s because we saw the Italians around us who were not concerned, so we didn\u2122t know why we would be concerned."

Then we boarded a boat, one from Kos, two from Rhodes, to Piraeus (Peirai\u00e9fs), where we arrived nine days later on August 2, 1944. It was very hot.

It took nine days to go to Piraeus. There were some Allied forces in the area. Also when we left Kos, the Germans had said that nobody could be in the streets, and everybody had to be inside because they didn\u2122t want the people to see the deportation happening. So when we left, the city was totally empt y in the streets and we thought it looked like a desolated city. And when we arrived in Athens, the Germans had told the population the same thing, so everybody was inside , and nobody was supposed to be in the streets to see people arriving."

            "answer": "It was very hard. It was a bad situation. We had already started in the boat. Some of the people were on the deck, but a lot of them were in the boat\u2122s hold and had no water or food. Even on deck, there was not much to eat, and it was also the month of July and it was pretty warm. So it was hard conditions. When we came out of the boat, the Germans had some vans to transport us, and they brought us a few kilometers away from the port to a military barrack that had been abandoned. It was in Chaidari and we stayed there for two days with no water. We felt as abandoned as beasts. The next day, the first day we were there, there was no water, so it was very hard. And then the next day they said we had to go out in the c ourtyard because they had to inspect us and our luggage. After we went in the courtyard, they looked through our luggage and our personal things, and they took whatever they wanted to take, and at that point in time we had to get on trucks. My mother and aunts were already on the truck, but my father and I were not. Then an SS German with his whip started to beat my fa ther, but we didn\u2122t know what he wanted because none of us spoke German. That was very hard, having no knowledge of the German language. Basically, the German wanted my father\u2122s shoes a nd so finally we understood. He wanted to take the shoes and bring them somewhere else, but we didn\u2122t know where. And that\u2122s when my father started crying. I had never seen my father cry be fore all the harassment he went though. I stated in my book that \ufb01Olympian Nazis needed Jewish shoes for their Aryan feet.\ufb02 The trucks arrived at the station and the train made up of cattle wagons (cars) was there. They kept families together. Each wagon had about 60 people in it. We didn\u2122t know the train\u2122s destination. In this wagon, there was a barrel with water, five loaves of bread, a bunch of onions, and some raisins. But the water was put in a barr el that was used for pickles, so the barrel was very salty, and with the movement of the trai n, the water became completely salty, and it was even worse after that. We were very thirsty, and when the train would arrive to a station, I could hear the sound of water. I would try to look out through the small opening high up in the wagon and yell for water, but to no avail. The trip la sted around 15 days. The train went though Greece, Yugoslavia, Austria, Czechoslovokia, and finally Poland to Auschwitz."

            "question": "During the train ride, what were you talking about, with either your family or other people on the train?",
            "answer": "During the time we were in the train, we were not really feeling like talking much, because we were worried and we didn\u2122t know what was going to happen to us. And every two to three days, the Germans would stop the train and open the wagons and they would have people go out to\u0160 to do their\u0160 to go to the bathroom in front of them and they were standing there next to them. And also when they used to open the wagon and people were coming out, sometimes there were some dead people. They would just take them and throw them in the fields. Those older people that had not survived because of no food and no water and they couldn\u2122t hold on, they were just being thrown. And then they would close the wagon again and continue the journey. And also for the bodily needs we had, there was in my wagon, a lady with a kid, and she had a small night pot. So we all were using it and throwing out its contents through the little window on the top area of the wagon. It was terrible. We spent 15 days as beasts, not feeling like human beings. After 15 days we arrived at Auschwitz, an unknown name for us. When we came out of the train the Germans told us not to take our luggage, to leave everything in the wagon. But we thought we wanted to have something to change into, si nce we had been in the train for so long, so we started to put clothing, one piece over another. We piled them onto ourselves. When out of the wagon we saw a big line of German Officers, well dressed and clean, and we wondered, \ufb01Why are they there?\ufb02 Then we started seeing a line, a nd that they were starting to split young people from old ones. I was with my mother and in orde r not to be separated, I put a scarf over my head and started walking like an older person, holding my mother. But one of the German officers saw this, and he lifted my head and saw that I was young. So I was separated from my parents. At that point my mother said, \ufb01If you have to split me from my children, you might as well kill me.\ufb02 My mother and father, other older people, and yo ung children, were in another line and that same night they were gassed and died. I and the other young people were put in another room and for the first time we found water. It was a place to take a shower. They threw us packs of clothes that were not matched in any way. We were al so totally shaved. But after so many days, we finally had water."

            "question": "And was that one of the first realizations you had that as a Jew you were being singled out?",
            "answer": "Maybe before I did not understand. But in Auschwitz, when we were all from Kos, together in the camp, yes, we knew. The language barrier was very hard, because even in the camp, when we received orders, we did not understand them, as we did not know any Germa n. And that was a big tragedy for us, as we didn\u2122t want to do something against the rules. Sometimes we were doing the opposite because of what the guards wanted and that\u2122s why I think language\u2013 People should learn languages, as the world is very big. After the showers and clothing, we had to go to the barracks. There were 30 in six lagers (barracks). There were 300 people in the barrack and three levels of wooden shelves \u0152 or beds \u0152 the majority occupied, so we did not know wh ere to go to spend the night. We did not understand what to do. But somehow, we found a few places. Lights off. It was night and cold, but we were very tired. We were woken at 5 a.m. for the appel, when everybody was counted. We stood in rows of five with few clothes. I was wearing a blue silk skirt and a man\u2122s pajama shirt, with no underwear. The shoes were wet after being immersed in disinfecting liquid. We had to stand for an hour until 6 a.m. Then we we re given coffee, which was just water with color but warm, served in dirty tin cans. It was the same for the 12 noon soup \u0152 warm with some potato peelings and some grains. These were served outside. Then we had nothing to do; we were free in the camp. The latrines were in a big barrack, with a long line of holes. Some women stayed in there for a long time, since it was warmer. But the guards with their long brooms would throw excrement on their heads so they would go out. There wa s a lot of misunderstanding because different people spoke different languages and came from varied cultures. We did not understand each other. To keep warm, women were asked to join others standing against a wall, maybe 20 together, to keep warm. We felt like dogs, stay ing on the floor having nothing to do. The soup came for the evening. The new arrivals might not take it, but the ones who were there for some time would take it for themselves \u0152 it was important to eat. Also, we saw piles of naked women cadavers being transported by women. In the afternoon, there was another appel and counting. There was distribution to each of us of about 200 grams of black bread, 10 grams of margarine, and one slice of sausage. We put the margarine on the bread with our fingers. A deportee from Hungary, called Magda, who was 14 years old and had lost her whole family, was a kapo. On some evenings, she distributed jam. She picked it up with a spoon to throw on our bread, but many times it ended up on the ground and many took it from the floor. People were very upset with her and it seems that she was killed by prisoners at liberation. After we ate, we entered the barracks to go to sleep. In my mind, I had many questions. I was sad, but I knew I must sleep. One day, we were told to go to work. We left the camp in formations surrounded by old soldiers from the Wehrmacht and dogs. We walked. It was cold and foggy. The soldiers asked us to sing Italia n songs \u0152 one song composed by Beniamino Gigli: \ufb01Mamma.\ufb02 We sang and cried. We arrived at a camp and were told to pick up one brick, which we carried out to the camp, and the next day we re turned it to the first place. It was demoralizing work \u0152 no need to think, only to get tired. It was work similar to that of beasts. In the next camp, surrounded by electrified wires, we saw people from Rhodes, me n and relatives. They looked bad \u0152 shaved, and dressed terribly. We gave the same sad impression to them. They worked in mines, salt and coal, all day long. My brother Dave, 25 years old, was there, and a week later developed pneumonia and went to the infirmary. I went there and called him. He came out and said, \ufb01I\u2122m sick.\ufb02 On Friday, we got a bowl of soup for three people with three potatoes, which I saved to take to my brother. I called and calle d, but he did not come. A nurse came out and told me not to think about my brother anymore, and also said, \ufb01You should eat your potato.\ufb02 During the night, a truck had come to take the very sick ones who could not work anymore, and they were killed. Years later, after liberation, when I was in Florence, I had a dream. I saw my brother with a long white shirt and he said, \ufb01You, you\u2122ll live!\ufb02 And I never forgot this. The daily life in Auschwitz, I already mentioned. The stronger ones did not let us pass to get water to wash our faces. We were 2,000 individual s. You had to, in a way, fight for survival.

The difference with the Sephardic Jews was that we were more integrated into the rest of th e culture and population and various religions.

There were four women in the washing rooms and we were washing blankets from dead people or sick people and all the dirty clothes that were from the people who had died, also from diseases, with li ce and with\u0160 We were obliged to wash about 60 blankets a day. I was washing then. And at some point in time, there was an officer that came in with other SS and they had their handke rchiefs on their noses because the smell was unbearable in there. They said, \ufb01Keep washing and working. We are doing an inspection.\ufb02 And this officer, at some point in time, looked at me and asked in French, \ufb01Where are you coming from?\ufb02 So I said, \ufb01I\u2122m coming from Kos and th en from Auschwitz,\ufb02 because that\u2122s where I was coming from at the time. I was then in Lands berg. And the officer asked, \ufb01Where are your parents?\ufb02 And then I said, \ufb01They stayed in\u2013 they stayed in Auschwitz.\ufb02 And then after that he asked if I wanted to work in the kitchen. No, he asked first, \ufb01What were you doing before?\ufb02 And then I said, \ufb01Certainly not that.\ufb02 Then he looked at me and he said, \ufb01I can see from your hands,\ufb02 because I still had good hands at the time. Then he asked if I wanted to work in the kitchen. The kitchen was the best place to work, because th ere was food and it was warm. So I said, \ufb01Oh, yes.\ufb02 Then he left. And that evening he sent a prisoner, a guy from Vienna, who came over and gave me a pack with sugar and salami and so me margarine and bread and he said, \ufb01Don\u2122t say anything. This is the officer se nding you that.\ufb02 And for a few days , every day he sent that with the prisoner and then at some point in time, the kitchen chief (an older political prisoner interned in 1933) came and said, \ufb01You come here. I received orders that you are to work in the kitchen.\ufb02 And later on, I saw the officer. He was a doctor and he was working at the hospital. I tried to smile to him, but he put a finger on his mouth and he kind of made a sign not to say a word about it. And so I worked in the kitchen with my cousins Sara and Notrika and with another lady named Estela Levy. The kitchen was of course the best place to be, bu t also, a few days after I left the laundry to begin working in the kitchen, they closed th e washing rooms because all the women working there died. Some became crazy and the others got typhoid. They all died. So I was really lucky to have survived because I was saved by this officer, which is for me an amazing story. And that was the only contact I had directly. At some point in time, they closed the kitc hen because there were more and more bombings around the camps, because it was get ting to the end of the war. The Nazis were getting more and more scared, and there was hardly anything to eat because they couldn\u2122t get any food for the camps. And they were giving us a piece of bread for 18 people and the bread was usually half molded because it was so old. And so one day they asked us to go out of the camp and to go pick up some potatoes in the fields because \u2013 Ther e was no more food. It was raining steadily."

After that, they threw us another pack of clothes, and with that we went to another train. That day of selection was October 26, 1944, and from there we went into a train and we trav eled for two days. They most likely selected those who could still work in Germany. We arrived in Klaffering station and were divided into two groups: one to Bergen-Belsen and the other to Landsberg. At that point, they told us to pick up coats that had been thrown on the ground. They told us to put the coats on and then start walking. It was night, and it was cold, so we put the coats on and started walking for the whole night. And while we were walking, we were kind of feeling like there was sand on us, but we kept on. We saw the country, you know, with lights and people far away. We saw the dogs and things and we kept on walking all night, and we still had this sensation that we didn\u2122t understand, something that felt like sand on us. Then, when we arrived in Landsberg, all the lights were very bright in front of the camp. And then we saw the officers. They were healthy, and in their uniforms, and clea n, and they were in a line waiting for us. They asked us to throw the coats on the floor, and when we took the coats off, we realized they were full of lice. And our whole bodies were full of lice because basically what they wanted\u0160 They had no way to transport these coats with lice, so they had us carry them over to Landsberg. Tape 3, Side A"

            "answer": "The camps were not too big, like Landsberg, so what they did in Auschwitz, they just chose, did a selection and picked some of the people to work in some of the camps, so some went to Landsberg, others went to others. That\u2122s why they did the sel ection and took randomly, people to go in one or the other. The Germans wanted to get the people out of the camp because the Russians were advancing, and the Nazis didn\u2122t want anyone to see what was going on. And then the plan was just to blow the place up and blow up the crematorium and the gas chambers, but they didn\u2122t have the time before the Russians arrived."

            "answer": "We were sent to pick up pot atoes as it rained heavily, and that was when we said no for the first time. The guards came back with a bucket full of excrement, and threw it at us, saying \ufb01Pig Jews.\ufb02 It was very cold, but we had to go out to wash ourselves off in the rain. Two days later, there was an evacuation, a long ma rch -- not a death march, but a l ong one: three days and three nights, sleeping at night on the ground in the forest. Where were we going? We didn\u2122t know. We arrived at Dachau. It was terrible, filled with leftover people from many camps. Was it the end of the world? There was no food; we went the night without food. Then a walk to Alach, and we were liberated from there. There was inte nse Allied bombing. They were very close and we were ordered to a bunker. In the morning when we came out, no Germans were there. What had happened? Did they leave? On the men\u2122 s side of the camp, there was no movement. We walked through camp. We entered in barracks that had been occupied by German guards. There were beds, food, even a piano. I played from th e Butterfly Opera. Then we heard trucks and thought: they\u2122ve come back. We were trembling but going out we saw Jeeps. The soldiers were not speaking German, and they said \ufb01Hello.\ufb02 Th ey were Americans finding camps and liberating them. Everybody was hugging. The soldiers gave us things: food, chocolate, etc. We stayed there about one month be fore evacuating the camp."

            "answer": "My health status? No, these were refugee camps. We were not sick, just miserable and skinny. The Americans found Nazi women\u2122s uniform s and we wore them. The refugee camps in Modena were full. Trucks were sent for different areas. Finally, a woman from the Red Cross asked: Why are you here? We wanted to know how to get to Rhodes. She told a driver to take us six girls to Bologna. When we arrived only the concierge was there, who was surprised to see six girls in German uniforms. The building was fu ll of furniture left there by Jews when they got away. The community president came and told us that the Palestinian brigade was there. They brought water and food. But something incredible happened \u0152 they mentioned that they had a \ufb01Franco\ufb02 among them. It was my brother, Nissim. He was at the Austrian border and this was something beyond belief. He came to Bologna a nd he stayed one week. He brought me many things. I stayed about a month, and had a good time. I was invited by the Jewish community \u0152 Mrs. Weiss from the joint told me that I should go to Florence, and she found a person for me. It was not easy to go through Italy without being able to go to Rhodes. We six girls found there a girl of 14, who had lost all her family, and we took her under our care. Her name was Alice Starika. I had no contact wi th Africa then, but my fa mily sent some money. In Modena, we had an interesting event. To get soup, we had to first get a number in the hall, and since we appeared in German uniforms, we were asked, \ufb01Who are you?\ufb02 And when we explained, their response was \ufb01How can I be sure what you\u2122re saying is true?\ufb02 So we showed the tattooed number. We ate well and went upstairs to sleep. In Florence, we got help from the UN to pay for the pension and food. We had two rooms for six women: three per room for a year. The Israelis gave us uniforms. Some of the girls ended up going to America. I wanted to go to Kos and see what was left, which ended up being nothing."

When I was in Florence at some point in time, I went to Kos, and I stayed in Kos for three months to try to see if there was something that was still there\u2013 my family. Bu t nothing was there and then in the Treaty of Yalta, the island that had belonged to Italy went to Greece. The nuns who were on the island of Kos had to leave, so the Italian government sent a boat to pick up a ll the Italians that were still on the island, and I embarked on the same boat and we le ft. We went to Rome, so I stayed in Rome with the nuns and then after that I went back to Florence. And then from Florence, I got in touch with the man I eventually married, who was an Ita lian officer in the Italian army whom I had met in Kos many years before and we were\u2013 we kne w each other. He was deported as a military prisoner to Auschwitz, so he had different treatment. I had gotten in touch with his family and asked if they had news about him and found out he was there. He was very surprised I was alive and came out of the camp. And then we got married and went to Africa."

And also when I had a daug hter, I decided I would continue and write a bit for her, so it would remain for the next generation. Then, I left the book there, half-finished. And a year later, when I went to Brussels, I realized that some of the people in Europe were kind of talking about the concentration camps and the gas chambers\u2013 Some politicians in France were talking about it like a minor detail of histor y \u0152 as if it was not that important. And then some professors were even saying things like that in university in France, so I got very revolted about that. And I decided somebody, like many othe rs, should put it down on paper. When the commemoration of the liberation of the 50 year s of the deportation came, it was 1994. In 1994, I said I would also finish my book \u0160 as a memory \u0160 to all the people that I knew that had died.
