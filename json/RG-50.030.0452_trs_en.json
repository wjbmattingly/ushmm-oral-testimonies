Her parents, four brothers, and she moved to the nearby island of Kos, where they\nwere active in the Jewish community. Jews, Greek Orthodox, and Catholics lived in harmony.\nGerman troops arrived on Rhodes and Kos in September 1943, and soon began strictly enforcing\nracial laws. Suddenly, in July 1944, all Jews in Rhodes (about 2,000) and Kos (about 500) were\ndeported. \u201cWe had no idea what was happening,\u201d she says. They sailed nine days to Piraeus\n(Peirai\u00e9fs), and stayed two days without water in Chaidari, where SS men beat her father for his\nshoes. Then, they rode in cattle cars \u201cfor 15 days as beasts\u201d to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Lucia\u2019s\nparents were gassed immediately, and her youngest brother, 25, was killed later. One of her\nbrothers had moved to Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), and one had emigrated to Palestine before the war.\nLucia says she was the only survivor from Kos, among 150 survivors out of the 2,500 deportees.\nLucia was put in Birkenau. She discusses her tattoo, the crematoria, inhumane treatment,\ngrueling work, and starvation rations. In October 1944, as the Russians advanced, the Germans\ncleared out Auschwitz. She and her cousins underwent another selection. Lucia had stolen a beet\nand rouged their cheeks to look healthier. They were given lice-infested coats, and marched to\nLandsberg. At Landsberg, Lucia worked in the laundry where she caught the eye of a German\nofficer. He sent her extra food and had her transferred to the kitchen, where the conditions were\nbetter. Only a few days after she left the laundry, all its workers died from typhoid.\nLandsberg was evacuated as Allied Forces approached. Lucia was marched for three days to\nDachau and then to Alach, which Americans liberated in April 1944. The survivors moved\namong various refugee camps before arriving in Bologna, where Lucia found her older brother\nwith the Palestinian Army. After a month, Lucia went to Florence, and then returned to Kos to\nsearch for Jewish survivors, but found no one. After three months, she returned to Florence,\nwhere she was reunited with, and later married, a former Italian officer she\u2019d known in Kos. He\n\nThis is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

The couple moved to the former Belgian\nCongo, and stayed in Africa for 27 years.

There were multiple contacts between the two islands \u2014 visits and so on. So I can say I grew up on both islands. We took many trips between them. In Kos, I studied until age 11. Then, until age 17, I went to school in Rhodes, but had to stop in 1938 because of the racial laws. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

He was doing import/export commerce between the islands, especially between Kos and the other smaller island that belonged to the Duc de Canais (ph.; nothing similar found on Internet). In order to transport the merchandise, he had his own boat, and he was also going to Turkey to get some merchandise, since Kos 1s very close to the border of Turkey."

There were Turkish people, and there were Greek people that had been there for many, many years and generations. In Turkey, at the end of the time of the Sultan, when he chased them from Turkey, they sent away all the Greek people as well. So some of them came to the islands and so we\u2014 although we were Greek, we had a lot of Turkish traditions in our daily life \u2014 in our cooking, and even some of the words, to the point that my mother knew some of the Turkish words but she thought they had always been Greek words \u2014 all Greek words. But one year, she went to Turkey and discovered they were Turkish words."

            "answer": "We had excellent relationships. The two oldest brothers went to Rhodesia in 1937. The other brother, Nissim, went to Palestine at the time of the racial laws. He volunteered in the Palestinian Brigade (British Army), and fought in Africa and then in Italy."

            "answer": "No, we did not hear. We were pretty ignorant. We never felt anything. When the Italians came, they sent two groups of officers \u2014 Italian military \u2014 at some point in time. But we never felt anything because the Italians always behaved very well toward us. I said before that we were not supposed to go to school when the racial laws started, but the Italians were very apologetic to us. They told us that those were the rules that they had received and unfortunately they had to apply them at some point in time. Not at the beginning, but at some point they were obliged to. And also some of the Jews belonged to clubs \u2014 you know, an Italian circle of clubs, and we were excluded from them at that time also. But the Italians were again apologetic about that. They said they were obliged to do it because of some rules they had received from the mainland. Generally, we had normal life even after racial laws."

And the Italian behavior stayed the same. It\u2019s only after the attempt on Hitler\u2019s life, that things got tougher because of the Germans. That was on July 20, 1944."

            "question": "I think I forgot my question. I think I understand that it wasn\u2019t a drastic change of lifestyle when the racial laws were implemented. However, I\u2019m wondering if you and your family, or others in the Jewish community were talking about this and very concerned about this.",
            "answer": "We had news, in some of the Italian newspapers, but since it was so far away, we thought, you know, we were not concerned. We were very isolated in the islands and even the attitude of the Italian officers was very relaxed, so we wouldn\u2019t think that something was really happening to us. That\u2019s why we were not as concerned. The situation worsened when Badoglio, who was marshal in the Italian army, and the king, Vittorio Emmanuel the Third, when they asked for the armistice with the Allies. And at that time, things got a little tougher.  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  At that time, when the Germans saw that the Italians were asking for the armistice and they got it, they felt they were betrayed by the Italians. At that point in time, they sent some troops to the islands. It was only nine months before our eventual deportation that at some point in time the Germans, after seeing what the Italians did, sent more troops to the islands. But the local population was not aware of anything, and even the Germans that were on the island were acting very normal and polite with all the population. We did not know, but in the meantime, they had taken all the information on Jewish families. They took all the addresses and knew who was living where and they already had all the information on Jews. They were not showing anything, but they had already started. German troops came to Rhodes on September 8, 1943. At some point, after the armistice, the Germans had their headquarters in Rhodes. And at that point, they called all the Italian officers and told them, \u201cYour king and the Marshal Badoglio have asked for armistice, so what are you going to do?\u201d And at that point, the Germans told the Italian officers that they were German prisoners. But the officers stayed on the island. They were not supposed to leave the island, but they were not put as a military officer in prison, they were just free to stay on the island at that time. Therefore, the Jews were registered, but we knew nothing about what was going on in Europe. At the moment of the armistice, when the British saw that the Italians were joining the Allies, they tried to land in Kos. But the Germans had sent some boats from Rhodes to bomb them. And then the British tried to land in Rhodes, but they couldn\u2019t succeed, so they had to retreat. And so we stayed. And the Jewish population and the rest of the population stayed in Kos. The Italians didn\u2019t say anything and maybe didn\u2019t know anything about the plans of the Germans, but at some point, the Germans that were on the islands of course, told the population of Kos that if they wanted to leave, they could leave. This was because we were going to run out of food because the island was kind of isolated. It was surrounded by the British submarines, and we had difficulty finding food. So they had asked the population of Kos if any of us wanted to leave the island and go to Turkey."

And then, unfortunately, I feel bad about the ignorance, but we had no more radios, but more than that\u2014 that was not an excuse, but more than that it\u2019s because we saw the Italians around us who were not concerned, so we didn\u2019t know why we would be concerned."

And it was only after the Hitler coup (assassination attempt) that the Germans had to carry out some of the orders they received and round up the people.

So we had our way of doing things, and we were not having any life together with the Germans. Plus, the Italians were still there. In Europe, it was different. The deportation for us was very hard because we had no idea. We had never felt anything before that day. And the difference in Europe, where they had to hide, where they were feeling things growing bit by bit... we had no feeling of that kind on the island, so it was even stronger for us \u2014 the shock \u2014 because suddenly everybody was rounded up and we had to be deported and we were wondering why and where\u2014 where we were going. Because we had never felt anything of the war until then, except for the racial laws, but we had attributed that to the war."

When the British left the area, then the Germans arrived mid-September. We didn\u2019t feel it much, but after the deportation, my mother found out from the Mother Superior knew that the Italians had been trying to defend the king\u2019s idea and kind of do a resistance against the Germans. And at that point in time, the Germans took some of the Italians prisoner. But I only found out after the deportation (?), the Mother Superior told me when I went back to the island, that the Germans had taken some Italian officers prisoner, and they had asked one officer to dig a kind of a hole in the ground, and they shot 300 of them.

We were about 500 people, about 30 families.

So when we left, the city was totally empty in the streets and we thought it looked like a desolated city.

            "answer": "It was very hard. It was a bad situation. We had already started in the boat. Some of the people were on the deck, but a lot of them were in the boat\u2019s hold and had no water or food. Even on deck, there was not much to eat, and it was also the month of July and it was pretty warm. So it was hard conditions.  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  When we came out of the boat, the Germans had some vans to transport us, and they brought us a few kilometers away from the port to a military barrack that had been abandoned. It was in Chaidari and we stayed there for two days with no water. We felt as abandoned as beasts. The next day, the first day we were there, there was no water, so it was very hard. And then the next day they said we had to go out in the courtyard because they had to inspect us and our luggage. After we went in the courtyard, they looked through our luggage and our personal things, and they took whatever they wanted to take, and at that point in time we had to get on trucks. My mother and aunts were already on the truck, but my father and I were not. Then an SS German with his whip started to beat my father, but we didn\u2019t know what he wanted because none of us spoke German. That was very hard, having no knowledge of the German language. Basically, the German wanted my father\u2019s shoes and so finally we understood. He wanted to take the shoes and bring them somewhere else, but we didn\u2019t know where. And that\u2019s when my father started crying. I had never seen my father cry before all the harassment he went though. I stated in my book that \u201cOlympian Nazis needed Jewish shoes for their Aryan feet.\u201d The trucks arrived at the station and the train made up of cattle wagons (cars) was there. They kept families together. Each wagon had about 60 people in it. We didn\u2019t know the train\u2019s destination. In this wagon, there was a barrel with water, five loaves of bread, a bunch of onions, and some raisins. But the water was put in a barrel that was used for pickles, so the barrel was very salty, and with the movement of the train, the water became completely salty, and it was even worse after that. We were very thirsty, and when the train would arrive to a station, I could hear the sound of water. I would try to look out through the small opening high up in the wagon and yell for water, but to no avail. The trip lasted around 15 days. The train went though Greece, Yugoslavia, Austria, Czechoslovokia, and finally Poland to Auschwitz."

And every two to three days, the Germans would stop the train and open the wagons and they would have people go out to\u2014 to do their\u2014 to go to the bathroom in front of them and they were standing there next to them. And also when they used to open the wagon and people were coming out, sometimes there were some dead people. They would just take them and throw them in the fields. Those older people that had not survived because of no food and no water and they couldn\u2019t hold on, they were just being thrown. And then they would close the wagon again and continue the journey. And also for the bodily needs we had, there was in my wagon, a lady with a kid, and she had a small night pot. So we all were using it and throwing out its contents through the little window on the top area of the wagon. It was terrible. We spent 15 days as beasts, not feeling like human beings.

It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  After 15 days we arrived at Auschwitz, an unknown name for us. When we came out of the train the Germans told us not to take our luggage, to leave everything in the wagon. But we thought we wanted to have something to change into, since we had been in the train for so long, so we started to put clothing, one piece over another. We piled them onto ourselves. When out of the wagon we saw a big line of German Officers, well dressed and clean, and we wondered, \u201cWhy are they there?\u201d Then we started seeing a line, and that they were starting to split young people from old ones. I was with my mother and in order not to be separated, I put a scarf over my head and started walking like an older person, holding my mother. But one of the German officers saw this, and he lifted my head and saw that I was young. So I was separated from my parents. At that point my mother said, \u201cIf you have to split me from my children, you might as well kill me.\u201d My mother and father, other older people, and young children, were in another line and that same night they were gassed and died. I and the other young people were put in another room and for the first time we found water. It was a place to take a shower. They threw us packs of clothes that were not matched in any way. We were also totally shaved. But after so many days, we finally had water."

The language barrier was very hard, because even in the camp, when we received orders, we did not understand them, as we did not know any German. And that was a big tragedy for us, as we didn\u2019t want to do something against the rules. Sometimes we were doing the opposite because of what the guards wanted and that\u2019s why I think language... People should learn languages, as the world is very big. After the showers and clothing, we had to go to the barracks. There were 30 in six lagers (barracks). There were 300 people in the barrack and three levels of wooden shelves \u2014 or beds \u2014  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We did not understand what to do. But somehow, we found a few places. Lights off. It was night and cold, but we were very tired. We were woken at 5 a.m. for the appel, when everybody was counted. We stood in rows of five with few clothes. I was wearing a blue silk skirt and a man\u2019s pajama shirt, with no underwear. The shoes were wet after being immersed in disinfecting liquid. We had to stand for an hour until 6 a.m. Then we were given coffee, which was just water with color but warm, served in dirty tin cans. It was the same for the 12 noon soup \u2014 warm with some potato peelings and some grains. These were served outside. Then we had nothing to do; we were free in the camp. The latrines were in a big barrack, with a long line of holes. Some women stayed in there for a long time, since it was warmer. But the guards with their long brooms would throw excrement on their heads so they would go out. There was a lot of misunderstanding because different people spoke different languages and came from varied cultures. We did not understand each other. To keep warm, women were asked to join others standing against a wall, maybe 20 together, to keep warm. We felt like dogs, staying on the floor having nothing to do. The soup came for the evening. The new arrivals might not take it, but the ones who were there for some time would take it for themselves \u2014 it was important to eat. Also, we saw piles of naked women cadavers being transported by women. In the afternoon, there was another appel and counting. There was distribution to each of us of about 200 grams of black bread, 10 grams of margarine, and one slice of sausage. We put the margarine on the bread with our fingers. A deportee from Hungary, called Magda, who was 14 years old and had lost her whole family, was a kapo. On some evenings, she distributed jam. She picked it up with a spoon to throw on our bread, but many times it ended up on the ground and many took it from the floor. People were very upset with her and it seems that she was killed by prisoners at liberation. After we ate, we entered the barracks to go to sleep. In my mind, I had many questions. I was sad, but I knew I must sleep. One day, we were told to go to work. We left the camp in formations surrounded by old soldiers from the Wehrmacht and dogs. We walked. It was cold and foggy. The soldiers asked us to sing Italian songs \u2014 one song composed by Beniamino Gigli: \u201cMamma.\u201d We sang and cried. We arrived at a camp and were told to pick up one brick, which we carried out to the camp, and the next day we returned it to the first place. It was demoralizing work \u2014 no need to think, only to get tired. It was work similar to that of beasts. In the next camp, surrounded by electrified wires, we saw people from Rhodes, men and relatives. They looked bad \u2014 shaved, and dressed terribly. We gave the same sad impression to them. They worked in mines, salt and coal, all day long. My brother Dave, 25 years old, was there, and a week later developed pneumonia and went to the infirmary. I went there and called him. He came out and said, \u201cI\u2019m sick.\u201d On Friday, we got a bowl of soup for three people with three potatoes, which I saved to take to my brother. I called and called, but he did not come.

Years later, after liberation, when I was in Florence, I had a dream. I saw my brother with a long white shirt and he said, \u201cYou, you\u2019ll live!\u201d And I never forgot this. The daily life in Auschwitz, I already mentioned. The stronger ones did not let us pass to get water to wash our faces. We were 2,000 individuals. You had to, in a way, fight for survival.

The difference with the Sephardic Jews was that we were more integrated into the rest of the culture and population and various religions.

            "answer": "The work that was given to men was a lot harder and more difficult. They were going to mines and they would carry two great stones, so they had a much harder life in the camp and also, of the survivors that came out of our group, most are women. There are maybe only five or six men of the 150 that survived."

            "answer": "An extraordinary thing happened to me when I was in Landsberg, Germany. I was working at the time in the washing rooms. There were four women in the washing rooms and we were washing blankets from dead people or sick people and all the dirty clothes that were from the people who had died, also from diseases, with lice and with\u2014 We were obliged to wash about 60 blankets a day. I was washing then. And at some point in time, there was an officer that came in with other SS and they had their handkerchiefs on their noses because the smell was unbearable in there. They said, \u201cKeep washing and working. We are doing an inspection.\u201d And this officer, at some point in time, looked at me and asked in French, \u201cWhere are you coming from?\u201d So I said, \u201cI\u2019m coming from Kos and then from Auschwitz,\u201d because that\u2019s where I was coming from at the time. I was then in Landsberg. And the officer asked, \u201c\u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d And then I said, \u201cThey stayed in... they stayed in Auschwitz.\u201d And then after that he asked if I wanted to work in the kitchen. No, he asked first, \u201c\u201cWhat were you doing before?\u201d And then I said, \u201cCertainly not that.\u201d Then he looked at me and he said, \u201cI can see from your hands,\u201d because I still had good hands at the time. Then he asked if I wanted to work in the kitchen. The kitchen was the best place to work, because there was food and it was warm. So I said, \u201cOh, yes.\u201d Then he left. And that evening he sent a prisoner, a guy from Vienna, who came over and gave me a pack with sugar and salami and some margarine and bread and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything. This is the officer sending you that.\u201d And for a few days, every day he sent that with the prisoner and then at some point in time, the kitchen chief (an older political prisoner interned in 1933) came and said, \u201cYou come here. I received orders that you are to work in the kitchen.\u201d And later on, I saw the officer. He was a doctor and he was working at the hospital. I tried to smile to him, but he put a finger on his mouth and he kind of made a sign not to say a word about it. And so I worked in the kitchen with my cousins Sara and Notrika and with another lady named Estela Levy. The kitchen was of course the best place to be, but also, a few days after I left the laundry to begin working in the kitchen, they closed the washing rooms because all the women working there died. Some became crazy and the others got typhoid. They all died. So I was really lucky  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And that was the only contact I had directly. At some point in time, they closed the kitchen because there were more and more bombings around the camps, because it was getting to the end of the war. The Nazis were getting more and more scared, and there was hardly anything to eat because they couldn\u2019t get any food for the camps. And they were giving us a piece of bread for 18 people and the bread was usually half- molded because it was so old. And so one day they asked us to go out of the camp and to go pick up some potatoes in the fields because ... There was no more food. It was raining steadily."

            "question": "When did you leave Auschwitz for Landsberg and how did that come about, going from one to the other?",
            "answer": "At some point in time, they called us from the camp where we were and we had to go out and we had to be in line without clothes. And we had to pass in front of a medical team. Among them was Mengele. So we were very scared because there was another selection happening there. And a woman that was in front of me, one girl that I knew, who had been burned when she was a little kid by oil in the kitchen and she had a scar around the neck. She was a beautiful woman, but she had just that one thing. And they didn\u2019t know \u2014 the Germans \u2014 if it was an infection or something, so they put her on the side where the people were to be killed, because they thought it was a disease. My cousins and I were still around the kitchen at the time and I had taken a beet and I had looked for them in the block, but in the bock there was nobody anymore. I got very scared, so I ran and I saw them in line and I said, \u201cPut the beet on your cheek, so you will look good, because we are passing in front of the doctor.\u201d So that\u2019s what they did, and actually it was good for them because they looked so healthy, suddenly. After that, they threw us another pack of clothes, and with that we went to another train. That day of selection was October 26, 1944, and from there we went into a train and we traveled for two days. They most likely selected those who could still work in Germany. We arrived in Klaffering station and were divided into two groups: one to Bergen-Belsen and the other to Landsberg. At that point, they told us to pick up coats that had been thrown on the ground. They told us to put the coats on and then start walking. It was night, and it was cold, so we put the coats on and started walking for the whole night. And while we were walking, we were kind of feeling like there was sand on us, but we kept on. We saw the country, you know, with lights and people far away. We saw the dogs and things and we kept on walking all night, and we still had this sensation that we didn\u2019t understand, something that felt like sand on us. Then, when we arrived in Landsberg, all the lights were very bright in front of the camp. And then we saw the officers. They were healthy, and in their uniforms, and clean, and they were in a line waiting for us. They asked us to throw the coats on the floor, and when we took the coats off, we realized they were full of lice. And our whole bodies were full of lice because basically what they wanted\u2014 They had no way to transport these coats with lice, so they had us carry them over to Landsberg.

That\u2019s why they did the selection and took randomly, people to go in one or the other. The Germans wanted to get the people out of the camp because the Russians were advancing, and the Nazis didn\u2019t want anyone to see what was going on. And then the plan was just to blow the place up and blow up the crematorium and the gas chambers, but they didn\u2019t have the time before the Russians arrived."

There was intense Allied bombing. They were very close and we were ordered to a bunker. In the morning when we came out, no Germans were there. What had happened? Did they leave? On the men\u2019s side of the camp, there was no movement. We walked through camp. We entered in barracks that had been occupied by German guards. There were beds, food, even a piano. I played from the Butterfly Opera. Then we heard trucks and thought: they\u2019ve come back. We were trembling but going out we saw Jeeps. The soldiers were not speaking German, and they said \u201cHello.\u201d They were Americans finding camps and liberating them. Everybody was hugging.

The refugee camps in Modena were full. Trucks were sent for different areas. Finally, a woman from the Red Cross asked: Why are you here? We wanted to know how to get to Rhodes. She told a driver to take us six girls to Bologna. When we arrived only the concierge was there, who was surprised to see six girls in German uniforms. The building was full of furniture left there by Jews when they got away. The community president came and told us that the Palestinian brigade was there. They brought water and food. But something incredible happened \u2014 they mentioned that they had a \u201cFranco\u201d among them. It was my brother, Nissim. He was at the Austrian border and this was something beyond belief. He came to Bologna and he stayed one week. He brought me many things. I stayed about a month, and had a good time. I was invited by the Jewish community \u2014 Mrs. Weiss from the joint told me that I should go to Florence, and she found a person for me. It was not easy to go through Italy without being able to go to Rhodes. We six girls found there a girl of 14, who had lost all her family, and we took her under our care. Her name was Alice Starika. I had no contact with Africa then, but my family sent some money. In Modena, we had an interesting event. To get soup, we had to first get a number in the hall, and since we appeared in German uniforms, we were asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d And when we  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We ate well and went upstairs to sleep. In Florence, we got help from the UN to pay for the pension and food. We had two rooms for six women: three per room for a year. The Israelis gave us uniforms. Some of the girls ended up going to America. I wanted to go to Kos and see what was left, which ended up being nothing."

But nothing was there and then in the Treaty of Yalta, the island that had belonged to Italy went to Greece. The nuns who were on the island of Kos had to leave, so the Italian government sent a boat to pick up all the Italians that were still on the island, and I embarked on the same boat and we left. We went to Rome, so I stayed in Rome with the nuns and then after that I went back to Florence. And then from Florence, I got in touch with the man I eventually married, who was an Italian officer in the Italian army whom I had met in Kos many years before and we were... we knew each other. He was deported as a military prisoner to Auschwitz, so he had different treatment. I had gotten in touch with his family and asked if they had news about him and found out he was there. He was very surprised I was alive and came out of the camp. And then we got married and went to Africa."

These people had some links with Belgium because they were doing business with Belgium, since it was a Belgian colony. They had some offices there. So in 1960, most of the people that worked there, of this Jewish community and others, sent their families to Belgium, and that\u2019s why some of them stayed there and never left after that. I only went to Brazzaville during that time \u2014 the independence \u2014 but later we came back to Leopoldville and we stayed until 1974.

And also when I had a daughter, I decided I would continue and write a bit for her, so it would remain for the next generation. Then, I left the book there, half-finished. And a year later, when I went to Brussels, I realized that some of the people in Europe were kind of talking about the concentration camps and the gas chambers... Some politicians in France were talking about it like a minor detail of history \u2014 as if 1t was not that important. And then some professors were even saying things like that in university in France, so I got very revolted about that. And I decided somebody, like many others, should put it down on paper. When the commemoration of the liberation of the 50 years of the deportation came, it was 1994. In 1994, I said I would also finish my book \u2014 as a memory \u2014 to all the people that I knew that had died.
