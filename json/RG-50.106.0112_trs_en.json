This interview is part of the museum\u2122s project to interview Holocaust survivors and witnesses who are also volunteers with the museum. This is a follow-up interview that will focus on Jacob Wiener\u2122s post-Holocaust experiences. In preparation for th is interview I listened to the interview conducted with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, and we did two of them, a video on June 30 th of 1994, and an audio that wa s received by the museum on February first of 1996. And you also di d an interview with the Survivors of Shoah Visual History foundation on October 17 th, 1996, and I reviewed part of that also. I will not ask you to repeat everything you said in that interview, instead I will use this interview as an opportunity to follow up on those interviews and focus on your post-Holocaust experiences. This is tape number one, side A. I want to thank you for doing the interview with us today. Can you tell me what is your name, and what was your name at birth?",
            "answer": "Presently my name is Jacob Gerd, g-e-r-d Wiener, w-i-e-n-e-r. And formerly my name was Kopel(ph) Gerd Zwienizki, z-w-i-e-n-i-z-k-i ."

And just like a herring, where you cut off th e top and the bottom, the tail and the [indecipherable] so I cut off the z and the icki and it remains wien.

And from the contents of the letters I knew that it was going worse \u0152 from worse to worse \u0152 from bad to worse, because they wrote this person is not here any more, he went on vacation. What they meant by this of course was went to concentration camp. After awhile I don\u2122t hear from the peop le at all, letters came back censored, Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25, 1998 5or no letters came back. This went on every year. Every year I wrote a little article for myself about hoping that the war would end. We went out to the different organizations and \u0152 to find out if the war could be ended, but there wasn\u2122t much response in that respect, and so it went on til the end of the war. In 1945 the war ended, and many demonstrations were held and people ta lked about this and they [indecipherable] and they heard about this from other people."

It\u2122s \u0152 the only time when they wrote the things on the first page was during Kristallnacht. And afterwards they didn\u2122t write it on front of the pages. I read the paper, of course, and while I read the paper, I also learned English more , and \u0152 and I can only say th is, you see, that when the war started I was registered in class 4-D, which was clergy going to school, because I went to the Yeshiva and they were exempt from actually joining the war, even though I tried to join the war and \u0152 but the only thing was at that time, either buy war bonds, or I even tried to join the war by being an air raid warden, but after awhile they told me, you cannot be an air raid warden, I was considered an enemy Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25, 1998 6alien, despite the fact that I was Jewish in the United States, and I always had to get permission even to travel, let\u2122s say from Baltimore to Yonkers, where I had a little shop, in Yonkers."

After the war, about 1945, 1940 si \u0152 1946, I left the Yeshiva in Baltimore, the [indecipherable] Yeshiva Rabbinical college, I left them. I got semicha there and I talked about this, they tried to help Jews in Europe, they send out packages to them, they send out packages and then I tried to find people from my birthplace to whom I could talk and who maybe knew more about what happened at my particular place wh ere I was born. And I found people, I found people in New York. There was some people in New York by the name of Greenburg (ph). I talked to them what had happened in Germany. I also talked about other people, I went to orga nizations, like \u0152 had a big demonstration in Madison Square Garden. They had the em \u0152 demonstr ations all over, and bringing people e \u0152 over, and many people came over afterwards, but they had not actually been in the Nazi concentration camps per se, they had, during the war they had gone from Germany, Russia, Poland and so forth to Shanghai or into other places. And they came over. And then [indecipherable] and other people came over. Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25, 1998 7"

            "question": "I have a couple questions about what you just said. You said you left the Yeshiva, you got semicha there. Can you explain what that means?",
            "answer": "Semicha means like ordination to be a rabbi. At that time, the rabbi at the Yeshiva was Rabbi Ruderman, who had come from Lithuania just before the war. In fact, his wife was born in K\u00f6nigsberg, was east Prussia, part of Germany. And it \u0152 and it was not \u0152 there were not too ma ny people \u0152 during the war, of course, the number of students at the yeshiva increased and after the war it went down. At the end of the war, especially, I tried to become a United States citizen. Already during the war I tried to become a United States citizen. In 1943 was the first time I made an appeal to become an American citizen. Now at that time, the immigration policy was that you had to have first papers, a nd after first papers you have to wait five years and you can make an application to become a citizen. So, when I made my first application 1943, I was asked to come before a board in Baltimore, five different organizations, the navy, the \u0152 the war , the defense and so forth. And it was \u0152 it was rejected because at that tim e the war was \u0152 looked very bad because the Nazis had been stopped at Stalingrad and it was very bad, so they didn\u2122t want anyone to become a citizen unless they actually went to war. And later on I made the application, think around 1950, though it might be earlier, with the FBI to go for translations. So they said, if you want to make translation, we have to send you to Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25, 1998 8Germany, I didn't want to go to Germany, so I stayed here. But they helped me also in \u0152 to get my second papers, and I got them in, as I said before, in 1951."

And they were living there and the \u0152 her father was a merchant, he had \u0152 they had a business, and \u0152 and of course like all people at that time, tried to leave Germany after the Kristallnacht, which I consider the beginning of the end. Everyone knew that it would not change any more a nd they had to leave. Before that time, we also had tried to come out of Germany, but I don\u2122t want to talk before that time, but only say that they finally, in 1939, that\u2122s before the war, she came out with the Kindertransport, children\u2122s transport to England. And their parents also came out, because they had some relatives in England. I had also tried to come out with the transport, but just on the date when I received the permission to come to England, they stopped it. Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25, 1998 9"

            "answer": "It was a big crowd in Madison Square Garden. They made many [indecipherable] meetings. But, as I understand it now, you see, and as I read in the newspaper and so forth, there were alwa ys requests of people to come to the United States. They \u0152 at \u0152 at that time, in order to come to the United States , [indecipherable] you needed a \u0152 what\u2122s called a certificate \u0152 zertifickat. And there were only a certain number of zertifikats available per year for people from Germany, because a number of zertifikats had been set in nine [indecipherable] that time, and at that time the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 I mean, the type of population in America was different than it was in 1940 and 1950. So, many people got certificates but they were only dated for two or three years later. And who wanted to wait two or three years? We didn\u2122t want to wait two or three years. We didn\u2122t have an American certificate, even though I know from my reco rds, and my mother, that she had \u0152 my father had applied to go to the United States already in the 20\u2122s, but my mother didn\u2122t want to go becaus e she had all her family in \u0152 in Germany.

            "question": "I\u2122d like you as an eyewitness, to tell me what was going on in that protest at madis \u0152 Madison Square Garden. If you could describe the scene and what was said, and \u0152 and the feelings that the people had.",
            "answer": "I don\u2122t know any more exactly what went on there. I can only tell you it was a very big meeting. You see, the Madison Square Garden has a very big place and it was filled up to capacity. And there were many people who spoke about it, what happened in \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 in Germany, and what could be done and they wanted to \u0152 they wanted to influence the American government to do something about it. In that respect, I mean a little bit to the side, when I was in the yeshiva, there was a young man, he was young at that time, who ca me every week, every Thursday to the yeshiva and from there he went on to Washington to discuss with cabinet ministers to let Jews out. And his name was Michael Trist(ph), and the person he talked to that was discussing, Moshe Sherer, which recently passed away, became the president of the Agudath(ph) [indecipherable] organization. But every week they came out. And some of the yeshivas and some of other organizations made it, but it was a very tough time because the United States was interested \u0152 and it is not against the United States, the United States was interested to win the war. If we win the war, then everything will change. So we cannot bomb the trains to the concentration camps. And they heard the person, Jacob Rosenheim, I have his Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25, 1998 11book here, and I heard him speak many times , who le \u0152 sent letters, and I have the copies of the letters which he sent to Roosevelt and other people to do this. Only one person was successful to a certain extent, a limited extent and it was Ruth Gruber, I don\u2122t know if you heard of he r, who arranged with Secretary Ickes and Morgenstern(ph) and so forth, they arranged that thousand \u0152 that they permit a thousand Jews to go to Oswego, one of my family, and we also went to Oswego. In \u0152 that\u2122s in the \u0152 Oswego is near Lake Erie, I think, it\u2122s in the state of New York. So they did very many things, so the people came over and they were protesting and they were writing and they were talking to in-influential people. But it was not the mood at that time. It was just \u0152 in fact, th ey never felt that anything bad happened to the Jews, and it could be changed, until Kristallnacht. I think by Kristallnacht it changed, because that was the first time that Roosevelt called his ambassador from Berlin away and talked to him about what happened."

            "answer": "You must know that everything which was done by the Nazis was done secretly. And that\u2122s why people still denied if afterwards. And that\u2122s also why many people didn\u2122t know about it until very much \u0152 because, as I mentioned before, in the beginning we did \u0152 we did re ceive some correspondence, but afterwards we didn\u2122t receive correspondence. Everything went \u0152 I don\u2122t know how it came over here [indecipherable] channels, small radios, because they had no television here. It came out slowly after the war, it came out, even so set \u0152 so far that last year when I was in Germany, I heard certain things which I didn't even know happened during the war.

Same thing was when they killed my mother also, they said, we followed orders. But they did not have their own mind, they just said they followed orders.

And they even \u0152 many pe ople died because they tried to go there by force to Israel, to Palestine at that time.

We had \u0152 and my father\u2122s family was living in Montreal, and at that convention we had a meeting and at that meeting there was a great British journalist, I think Lady jo \u0152 James, I don\u2122t remember her name.

There should always be one \u0152 besides, then they asked the question, Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25, 1998 18what can we do in order to make peace he re? Well, there were all different answers and one person, this Lady James gave a very interesting answer, she said, we should build a wall, like they have the China wall \u0152 Chinese wall between China and the other things. They had another wall [indecipherable] Berlin wall. So we make a \u0152 at that time they were all interested in making peace by building walls. So they had the intention, this lady says, you make a wall between the Israelis and the Arabs. Of course it never happened, but that was the psychology and the \u0152 the ideas of the people at that time, you see that they might think \u0152 that they think by making walls, you can make peace. Just like during the war, you see, when the French made the Maginot line, they thought with a wall they can [indecipherable] the peace and the Nazis just walk around. And that was an interesting idea she had. Then of course there were the other wars [indecipherable] but when the \u0152 the Six Day War, you know, when they suddenly saw that the Jews were winning and there was a euphoria and they went in the streets with big bed sheets and you collected money, everything was okay, but unfor tunately, this a mistake for the Jewish people, they did not see what they could have done at th at time, if they had done it at that time, we wouldn\u2122t have trouble now. For instan ce, at that time the whole west thing, everything was okay. At that tim e they started to call it the West Bank. Before they didn\u2122t call it even the West Bank. It was Transjordania , it [indecipherable] Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25, 1998 19Jordania was \u0152 was separated between the east, the west and th-the whole thing about West Bank and East Bank and who knows what? These terms wouldn\u2122t came up there \u0152 the other words which were going on between Israel, there was always a trouble \u0152 they were always afraid the Jews would win. And they did win in some [indecipherable] at that time when the [indecipherable] and they captured all of the Sinai peninsula and they even had Arafat surrounded.

The 1960\u2122s were very turbulent in the United States and I would like some insight from you on how you re acted to some of what was going on around you. Specifically, let\u2122s start with the Civil Rights movement. Do you have any thoughts on that?",
            "answer": "I never felt any animosity, so to say, to anyone who was not Jewish or any other kind of color, because even in school in Germany , I had a black person, at that time they were called Negroes, in my class, and he came from a former German colony in east Africa. So I \u0152 I always tried to reconcile people and to try to \u0152 to understand other people\u2122s views. Now when this happ ened with the Civil Rights movement, of course when I was working in the department of Social Services in New York, we had also many people who were different colors, Orientals and other people of Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25, 1998 22different colors and I was always very good with them, and never had any problems. So, besides this, I remember when they had this march to Selma there was one Jewish person who was killed, Schwerner(ph). And Schwerner(ph), we knew his father, who had a wig fam \u0152 a \u0152 a business of making wigs, sheitel, in German. And so we knew about this, you see.

No, not that way. A-And try to have and try to see what it was.

It doesn\u2122t necessarily mean we \u0152 we \u0152 we have to leave our religion or our whatever we believe in, but we also acknowledge what others believe in, we don\u2122t fight them because of they\u2122re \u0152 they are different in certain respects."

But that was the \u0152 and age \u0152 I mean, the 60\u2122s were some kind of \u0152 it was a rebellion, it was rebellion of the youth. And I saw it myself because there was it \u0152 in my department, when the commissioner gave a talk, a group of peop le came, stopped him from talking and sat in front of him \u0152 sat in front of him, you se e, so that he couldn't talk any more, and talked against him.

You start with knowing yourself and then you will either \u0152 you cannot be everything, everybody [indecipherable].

But you have to know what you want to be. Because you cannot talk to other people if you don\u2122t have a point of Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25, 1998 26view of your own. So it \u0152 when I wrote the children and I was many asked to talk about what it means to grow up in Germany, and I was many times asked, what do you think about things which are going on in this world, I say, we cannot have all the answers, and I studied psychology, we cannot meet on the \u0152 always have all the answers, but we have to know one thing, that we have to have one point of view and sometimes we don\u2122t know the an \u0152 we don\u2122t always know the answer, you see. But then we have to have a belief, a faith [indecipherable] I have the faith in God, and finally he will make the final decision. I don\u2122t know, we make \u0152 made decisions and it would not happen that way. We had \u0152 we \u0152 we always thought, you see, that if we make this kind of treaty, we\u2122ll have peace.

That\u2122s why I told the children, you have to learn something about yourself and you have to go to school, you have to \u0152 education is the most important, now we all know it in America too, education is the more important. It\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s more important than learning about war Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25, 1998 27[indecipherable] education, because if you have n\u2122t educated you don\u2122t know how to \u0152 what kind of decision to make and wh ere to go.

And I found this out in three respects. Number one I found it out when I was working with child abuse, what was [indecipherable], that the children of \u0152 who were a bused didn\u2122t like to talk to their child \u0152 to their parents because they didn \u2122t want to make them feel ashamed or responsible.

Number two, I found out we had some relatives in Russia and my \u0152 my Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25, 1998 31brother once went to Russia and he spoke to them. And then some grandchildren of ours, from my \u0152 my \u0152 my uncle\u2122s grandc hildren came and they wanted to know about Communism and things like this. The children didn\u2122t talk about Communism to their parents, the \u0152 on why and what, but the grandchildren did. Then I also have this here \u0152 this \u0152 I worked with AAA, alcoholic anonymous, so the children don\u2122t want to talk about it to their parents, because they don\u2122t want to picture their parents as alcoholics. But the grandchildren want to get into [indecipherable]. And the same is also true with the Holocaust expe rience, that most of the time you see, the children don\u2122t want to hear about it.

            "answer": "All right. We moved to Silver Spring in 1988. When I came here I had a job already right away with the Montgomery county to give a course on the search for Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25, 1998 32identity by the famous Victor Frankl . It\u2122s an omo \u0152 i-it\u2122s called \u0152 Victor Frankl. And then I also tried \u0152 I \u0152 at that time the museum was just forming, it had an office on L or M street in Washington, D.C. and I was going there and talking to Miss Morgenstern and additional people of the museum, I was talking to them about this. But they were not organized yet, so I just let it go. Then I \u0152 I didn\u2122t want to take a job there, I just wanted to see if anything could be done. I was talking to them to \u0152 to the one in charge of the library. And then I started to become a regular volunteer when it opened up in 1993. Even before that I was already a volunteer. And in the first year I was also on the volunteer advisory board. One time I \u0152 I was a little bit \u0152 for a little while I was chairman, but then [indecipherable] two years, then you have to go out and I didn\u2122t want to \u0152 because you can only stay at wa \u0152 at \u0152 on the advisory board for two years, then you have to interrupt one or two years, but I didn\u2122t want to do it any more, no time. So what happened is now I\u2122m doing three things at the museum. Number one a visitor representative, which means on the floor doing all the different things wh ich should be done, which are necessary on the floor, about information and passes, elevators, all kinds of things. Number two, I\u2122m with the Fannie Mae organization [indecipherable] about taking groups, leading groups around, you ng childrens in their teens, junior and high school children.

And speakers\u2122 bureau, they have different person now, John Minnick. I went and I talked to the \u0152 different things. I also talk \u0152 I was asked by other organizations, by the Catholic University and by Fort Meade talked i-in York, Pennsylvania, in White Port, Virginia. [indecipherable] remember what the difference is, and talked [indecipherable] you see, I just talked there. But I only talked for a few minutes, let\u2122s say for 20 minutes, 30 minutes the most, 20 minutes and then they ask questions. But as we see, I showed them th e list and when I talked at this school, the high school, I was surprised that after the school was finished, after school was finished, people came and they stayed and they asked more questions. That\u2122s what I\u2122m doing now and I also \u0152 I also brought to their attention that it was 60 years now after the Holocaust and to do something about it, they didn\u2122t want to do anything in the beginning, but now it seems to be [indecipherable] doing something about it, you see. So I just got to all the different people [indecipherable] will also give a luncheon and I think it\u2122s a luncheon [indecipherable] the museum in January next year, about certain experiences in [indecipherable] Kristallnacht.

The only thing is like \u0152 like you say in social work [indecipherable] you see, the most important thing of a person is be able to listen, listen, you see. And so I try to listen to the other people, I don\u2122t always talk [indecipherable] . But I mean, in general it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s the attention, it-it-it\u2122s mainly to listen to other people, to understand what they mean by that, and if not you ask them. And it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s the most im portant, I think, and people should ask questions. You cannot always have the an swers because there are more questions than answers. [indecipherable] it\u2122s more question than answer. But it also says [indecipherable] the Bible says, and too in the Talmud that you don\u2122t ask questions, you \u0152 you ca nnot learn. So you see, you have to ask the questions and when you see something, you ask the questio n, why is this happening, why is this not happening. And not to be so bland and disregard what\u2122s going on around you, that don\u2122t have anything to do with you. You cannot live in this world, I tell them many times, as one person. You can only live with \u0152 you must have other people to live. What would you do if you would be only one person? Who is going to bake? Who is going to [indecipherable] Who is going to \u0152 to bring you from one place to Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25, 1998 35another, transportation and so forth. So we need all our other people too. Everyone has a job in this world, and we must all wo rk together. And we must all believe that we are not the final [indecipherable] and we\u2122ll be judged eventually."

I \u0152 because they needed someone to speak German to them, so they called me over, so I spoke to them. So inter \u0152 and was very interesting. This one person, she was a student in history, and the other one was in \u0152 working in the German embassy in Tunis. It just so happened that they wrote me, they knew that I would be in Germany , they telephoned me from Tunis to Bremen and they excused themselves as they could not come. See, I don\u2122t like to start conve r \u0152 correspondence with others, you see, but they wrote me. So that was one instan ce and they wanted to see me and they wrote me, by the name \u0152 the name of Schroeder , that I think they are related to the president \u0152 president of wer \u0152 Germany. So [indecipherable] works in the embassy. So then I had, another time I ha d the woman coming over and she said she was very depressed and she said, we were living in the zargabeit(ph), the Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25, 1998 36Zweibr\u00fccken and it\u2122s between border, French bo rder. And at that time in 1936 \u0152 \u212236? Yeah. They had the plevisute (ph) whether they want to come to Germany or not. So they decided to come to Germany because Hitler made so much propaganda there. But she said, we were always good friends with Jews. My fath \u0152 my \u0152 my father used to deal with Jews and my \u0152 and we always had good relationship. And then afterwards, when we joined Germany, then they called over my husband \u0152 her husband and they asked him what did he do with the Jews, you see? Why do you still keep contact with the Jews. I didn\u2122t understand exactly what she said, if he committed suicide or what he did. But anyhow, after she came back from the \u0152 going through the museum, she came back to me and she said to me, I don\u2122t want to see all this. In other words, she said, I don\u2122t want to remember all this because it gives bad memories back to me. So people come over sometimes and they tell you certain things. There are many other things, but you hear any other things. You sometimes see people who you haven\u2122t seen for years.

            "answer": "It \u0152 it took a long time to \u0152 people here in the United States and all over really found interest in the Holocaust. In the beginning no one wa nted to talk about it. And I know the people who come from Germany [indecipherable] don\u2122t want to \u0152 to buy German goods, and things of this so rt. After the years go by, people can look a little bit more in unbiased [indecipherable] peace and rest about what happened with us, and people want to know more about their past in hitl \u0152 in Hitler\u2122s time. You see, everyone had one ha d to rate \u0152 write a \u0152 what is called a family tree. And in the United States I think it came about when Haley wrote his book on roots and people want to know who\u2122s really my forefather, who are really my people before me. And I think this had some influence here that people want to know more about it and the children want to know more about their family. It could be an \u0152 and they learn a little bit about it in school, more th an before. It\u2122s unfortunate that in Maryland it\u2122s not compulsory to teach the Holo caust.

And that\u2122s why very im portant, you see that people like [indecipherable] we talk about the Holocaust, you see, we try to learn about it, we like to make Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25, 1998 39people aware about what happened and wh at can happen if the Holocaust and especially the second ge-generation, they sh ould know about that [indecipherable] they doing a good job.

            "question": "This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Jacob Wiener. This is tape number two, side A. And I had been asking you about the resurg ence of interest in the Holocaust, and I wonder if you think that the \u0152 the Holocaus t Museum itself has had some role in the resurgence of interest. If the Holocaust Museum itself had some role in the resurgence [inaudible]",
            "answer": "Okay, you also asked me about how I feel about certain things. I already told the Holocaust Museum there are certain things which I don\u2122t feel are correct. For instance, certain people, you see, certain people who had the experience and so forth, should be used to do some research in certain areas and \u0152 and I found that \u0152 that the Holocaust Museum is more interested in certain f acts, not \u0152 they would hear more about the emotions from other people, you see [indecipherable] . Of course, when you have emotions, you may not always be neutral, but there is no person in this world who is a neutral, you cannot be neutral in th \u0152 in \u0152 in th \u0152 in your mind [indecipherable] where it says you can be neutral in facts, you see. So for instance, Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25, 1998 40I [indecipherable] to them that they are \u0152 they\u2122re preparing people who have studied from books and every book has a certain bias. Because you can have 10 books and you have 10 certain points of view in 10 certain books. You cannot be full of bias. Of course, the survivor, or someone [indecipherable] also has certain biases, because what he went through. But his personal bias is \u0152 is actually what he learned during the Holocaust, I mean what the experience in the Holocaust, what I experienced or others experien ced during the Holocaust, so [indecipherable] so therefore I say, if you\u2122d send someone out to visit concentration camps for instant, you know, many survivors don\u2122t like to do this, because they want \u0152 don\u2122t want to have a second experience. But the people who go there with a professional degree and book knowledge, they may not know which questions to ask, proper questions. And that\u2122s why I said to them many times that \u0152 that I feel you should at least send one person also from the \u0152 from those Ho locaust people, you see, the sur \u0152 survivors and they should bring out their \u0152 their emotions, wha \u0152 how they feel about it. I feel about certain things, you see, feeling is not [indecipherable]. And that\u2122s one thing. And then \u0152 then, like I, you see, I don\u2122t feel too comfortable in maybe saying everything which is there, but you cannot always \u0152 you don\u2122t know who the other person is, how the other person would take it, if I tell them from my own inner heart, you see, how I feel about it. So I don\u2122t honestly know that, you see, Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25, 1998 41but I don\u2122t want to insult the person on \u0152 and things like this. But \u0152 but let\u2122s say when I lead the groups around, you see, I te ll them how I feel about it. And I tell the other people who I \u0152 how I feel about it. And I don\u2122t always know if this is the right way to say or not. You should always sa y your \u0152 your feelings. If you have very strong feelings about it, like I had about \u0152 as I mentioned to you before, about people can come out and they say they don\u2122t believe in God any more, you see, now I have the strong feelings about this. But \u0152 and na \u0152 once happened when I \u0152 when someone has invited me in New York, psychologist, a friend of mine, he asked me to talk about what happened during Kristallnacht. I couldn\u2122t say it, because it \u0152 I was \u0152 it was too much for me, I couldn\u2122t say it. I do cry. I couldn\u2122t say it. So there are certain times, in certain instances which made the greater impression on you. Makes a great impression. I didn't vi \u0152 didn\u2122t want to talk about the Holocaust, what happened to me, but after awhile I said to myself, the world must know, you see, like the book says. And, so therefore I said I would [indecipherable] about it, and so not everyone may like it, but that\u2122s what it is. I hope only that we gonna have this hatred any more and this kind of terrorism, and this kind of anti-Semitism, because I experienced anti-Semitism very early in class, in \u0152 in school."
