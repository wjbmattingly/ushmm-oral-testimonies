I remember this moment we was called and the whole ghetto was burning. And the smell was so terrible and besides this we know we left there many good people. I was very close with the Jewish people in ghetto because branch what my father was -- knitting, me. And in knitting line was many Jewish factorie s and many Jewish hokseller (?) what we was connected automatically because it was the busin ess and many Jewish people, X number, very fair playing business men. Some was bad and some was good and we was very upset after we saw the Warsaw burning. And before the Wars aw burning my father and me, we took three families from ghetto and we found location, not me , my father mostly --was very good person, very good Christian, and took the Christianity for daily not only during Sunday. In other words took everything what think is right did. This mo ment because we received, father and me, we received special privilege going to ghetto buying something what we need for supplying our machinery. People were crying please, good people couple good family you know was connected to us and before the war Jewish uprising my father found th ree places where the people can hire. One of the places was the Swedish Embassy in Warsaw and there was housekeeper, Polish family, and was very devoted Chri stian. And this people said to my father if you have no choice and you are like help the Jewish people we can hire the people. (Female voice in the background said \ufb01hide\u2122). And my father took some ve ry big risk because only one country on Europe during the war German sugges t if somebody hire Jewish be killed on spot, what happened thousand, thousand times. And still my father took the chance and took the family, Malamed family, Benyamin Malamed and Irena Malamed with two young sons took from ghetto with the housewives what we ha ve and transferred to the Warsaw Swedish Embassy. These people lived th ere without the big risk. Af ter moment where German and Jewish agent start one action where German sugg est and propose if Jewish family, Jewish men like be transfer to America or to other count ry and against the German who was captured by Aryans and pay some money, th at is possible. And this idea was created by agent, Jewish fellow, son of the famous Fabricant in Lodz and this fellow organized with the SS Gestapo some place in Warsaw close to our factory {Duga} Hotel Polski and sent all over the information we transfer Jewish people against the German people in the hands of the Aryans and each person must pay some hundred dollars in gold. And my family, Mr. Malamed believed this and one day said, I am going to Hote l Polski and I be glad to be transferred to America and from America some German be transferred here who was in hands of American army or some other army, prisoner of war. A nd this my friends go there to Hotel Polski and from this moment we lose the track. After couple weeks we know these people went to some concentration camp on the west and later there we learned that that was Bergen-Belsen because Polish underground look which transport come back and probably some search was done by Polish underground army and we know the people go west and later there we know was in Bergen concentration camp. After the war 1946 I took couple of days off from duty in American army and I went to Bergen-Belsen, lo ok for my friends. And I was too late. Two weeks before I arrived there Malamed family went to Israel."

We know him from Lodz and was in Warsaw ghetto and we took these people, not really we because I not was there, my father created different situation asked some Polish policeman who took the people and bring to the place here supposed to be mean to Hungarian Embassy. I wa s couple time there visit. This was not nice place because was in basement, second baseme nt below the ground level because this was building years, years ago belonged to very famous Polish aristocracy. And this was below, second floor below the ground because was wine cel lar and this people was there for x number of months. I visit there. The people receive each couple days special food there and this time you must be very careful buy big amount of food because people think you are single why you buy so much, if it was possible to buy. And this building was not occupied by nobody because was partly destroyed. And still my father friend was each day there and watched after the building. The same talking you know, go to the pe ople and bring him something. And was very famous situation in Warsaw where maybe you know from the other sources, in Warsaw was SS very brutal man Kutschera, General Kutschera and this animal killed people each day by own hand and was escorted each day by twenty, thirty chairmen with guns and gun prepared to shoot if somebody attacked the SS man Kutschera and main office Kutschera was three buildings from the place where our people was hire in th e basement and we was thinking and the people was thinking this is the best place, close to the SS. And every week was all right. Only one day Polish underground tried to kill Kutschera because he was a very bad man who killed thousand people and sent to death. On the corner Chopina where the Embassy was and the Polish underground took the action. Kutschera was kille d. Many other German was killed and that was good for Polish underground. And was not good for the people who was in the basement because from this moment all blocks was put with the wire around and nobody could go in and out from the building where was hire the Jewish two family. Was Mr. like I said before and second family was only one person Mr. Epstein. And was start problem supply the food for the people in the basement. And we never go there because later there start Warsaw uprising and the people living in the basement lose the co ntact. We know from ot her people later after Warsaw uprising the people survived all Warsaw uprising and go to scourge (?) because after Warsaw collapsed the Germans took all people out from Warsaw and go to checkpoint in Geraldof or near the border of Warsaw and sele ct. And because these people was very, very weak and white color the German SS recognize the people was Jewish and Warsaw uprising mean the march from Warsaw was only family La ndau, son and mother and father. The other, Mr. Epstein, was probably like some people think was killed by Landau family."

That\u2122s story I heard after I come back to Poland from American army and I talked to people who survived the Warsaw uprising. That was three family, nice people who we tried help.

And we supposed to go to someplace we don\u2122t know yet at this time. And I talked to one Austrian fellow with Austrian insignia in German army because I speak German. I asked him listen, what we can do, we must go from here, and my mother is sick. And the fellow said, maybe I can help you and said, you can go out if you pay some money in gold. And we have the gold with us because nobody said (?). And I give for each person twenty gold dollars. And was everything prepared. We must go through physician and select like sick people. And one hour after I talk to this fellow some start \ufb01boom\ufb02 there and SS st art screaming, shrying and make noise, everybody out. Why? Because from Red Cross International, Red Cross from Sweden and Switzerland, people supposed to see how German treat the people after Warsaw uprising. And we was pressed going up to the doctor, we was lying to the doctor, and we was take out, kick and push and put in the cars, cow cars, how do you call the transport?"

            "answer": "With water was not so good. With water I was sick after it. All transport I was very sick to the stomach. And I was thinking I die, because why I st ay in the transport. I was like usual very stupid family man. I was thinking family that is something what is not breakable. Because was two young sister, my mother and my father. I was thinking I am the most powerful young fellow and I have not other obligation, I must help my family. Special I was taught by my father and mother. My father and mother was f our years in World War First in working camp in Germany and said to us, because we was family we survived. And going to Germany with my family I was thinking the same. I am the youngest fellow, powerful. I supposed to help and I help because I know my character. A nd happened was not working place only was concentration dead camp where we was there and selected, women Theresienstadt and men stay in Flossenburg. And after the w hole transport we go from Warsaw by this car. If I have not obligation to my family I go hundred times escape because was not so bad. During night I can jump because was open. I can do this. And I cannot jump and go and lift my mother who was fifty years old and my father and two young gi rls. And that was the reason I landed in concentration camp. After we arrived on Flossen burg I was thinking I die. After we stopped in one place before Flossenburg, Weiden I asked the fellow who was on the train, give me hot water a little bit because I am very sick. I sp eak German and the fellow said fine, I give you. And give me the steam, after one minute there wa s water from the steam. And I drink maybe one a little this and that\u2122s what probably helped me. And from this moment the locomotive was changed and to this transport the locomotive wa s connected with SS people. Because SS people only go to concentration camp with the transport."

            "question": "So before then these were German army?",
            "answer": "German railroad men. Railroad men was like ar my during the war. And we went there to concentration camp, Flossenburg and there was so nice sign \ufb01Arbeit Macht Frei\ufb02 mean during the work you can be free. And there was the selection, women on one side, men on the other. And start the problem like you know all concentration camp has. Each day something new, each day people were killed. People was pushed from the stone, steinbruk from hundred twenty feet high. On the top, you know, somebody push you to the bottom. People from the first moment was selection who is engineer on one side, who is physician on other side, and these people who was high educated was killed first, not by bullet, by walking up to knee in the water, very bad condition. And people who work a ll time hard and has hard life was prepared to this. The intelligent people was not prepare d. Each day was somebody from our group to die, die. And was so many diseases and was terrib le. From our transport, I remember somebody took the numbers, over three and a half thousand people come back only one hundred eighty three people back. Between the bad people was two friendly American boys who supplied to Warsaw through the air ammunition and guns wa s shot by German and landed close to our house Mirdova and went with us together to concentration camp Flossenburg and if you go to Flossenburg what I visit couple years ago are ho w many Polish people died there, was mostly died Polish, Russian, very small Jewish and two Americans. They died in Flossenburg. Help Polish people. And till concentration camp terri ble, was very bad, and our camp was governed by criminals, not only SS criminals, and German criminals. We political because from Warsaw operation was political. We were called political prisoners. We was with the red triangle and P. The other German prisoner, the bandits, was with green. Other color, some Jewish was blacks (?) star. And I tell you one thing, in concentr ation camp I never think people the prisoner was very friendly each other and never, never I sa w or (?) you re Polish or you are Jewish or you are, for example, French. Was not so, people think was very bad atmosphere. We never had bad experience, for example, with French, Jewish, Russian, the same. We was prisoner. We experienced the same problem and that\u2122s the st ory in concentration camp. Many things I can point out to you about the concentration camp because it was a very brutal moment and depressed. How many times you go do something somebody push you, the SS or kapo. Kapo mostly was in our concentration camp was German prisoners, sadist. And some was Jewish too. And I cannot say the prisoner was something one agai nst the other. In my camp was like I said before, General Kenaus was killed and all generals, Italian generals who was against Hitler and Mussolini this time, the group called General (??) people, generals, age 60-70 was treated very, very badly by not only German, by the prisoners , I don\u2122t know why, the people must have died there. Because was something this time I di d not understand. In my eye one general was not killed and was very, very bad wounded by one criminals and took a chair and punch the chair on the head. And each day was terrible. And pr oblem was the Appel. It was the Appel and somebody was missing because died already and where is the body, for example, because on Appel we must count the body and live people. That sometimes takes two hours, three hours before every numbers come together. I hope I can tell you more. Many friends from my town, from this group, 3,000, died, because there wa s not enough eat, was not enough medicine. I was very lucky, I got some in hospital. And my father, special, helped many Polish people give some medicine, maybe not help too much and sti ll help some. After war was end some Russian people, in this concentration camp was 5,000 Russi an army officers, and this people was stoned one guy (??) who was very brutal, beat my father once very badly, and this Russian (?) took the gun because American army give us the gun. Shoot if you think so somebody is, give it to him. Shoot him. Nobody from Polish group shoot no body. The Russian a good many, many, many."

We eat, some people has not food, not enough food or not good food and these people die fast. That wa s the reason. And besides this reason was my mother was, I feel, during my sitting in concen tration camp, each evening I prayed to the God, if somebody must die, better me because I am al one, not my mother, not my sisters, not my father because my father has obligations to family , my mother obligation to sisters. All time I pray. After I come back from camp, my mother said each day I prayed to God the same. Let take me, I am the oldest woman and save th e children. Probably something helped us."
