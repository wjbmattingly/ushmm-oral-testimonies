So he was trying to warn us about something like that. So we stayed in. Then the next day we did go out and walked around and saw the destruction. And then that morning my uncle was arrested and sent to -- Ben Bruner, that was my uncle, he was arrested and sent to a concentration camp. He later got out because my Aunt Esther bribed one of the Gestapo people to get him out so he could come to America with us."

But my Aunt Esther, younger than my mother, she was the motivating factor. She said to my mother, pack the suitcases, pack the boxes, we\u2019re leaving. And my father came along with us, even though he felt that it would not be so bad. There were people in my family who left earlier. My Uncle Beryl was in Detroit already and of course grand-uncle Jassie was in Detroit. But he had gone much earlier, for economic reason. Beryl went because he realized things were getting bad."

And so I felt as long as she felt it was an adventure, I was going to go along. And she made it easy for my brother and myself. We didn\u2019t worry.

            "answer": "Well, they got the affidavit from Uncle Jassie in Detroit. The -- the hard part was that my grandparents wouldn\u2019t come. And so they left them in Hamburg, Germany, and my two aunts and my mother, they had to say goodbye to their mother and father, and that was very difficult. And my mother really never got over it, I don\u2019t think Ceeta ever got over it either. They went to Poland, and we have letters from Poland where they\u2019re living in an apartment and letters that we sent and packages that we sent were opened up and -- by the censors and money and food was taken out, so that they would get a little bit of what we had sent, but not very much. And that happened through 1940 -- \u00b039 - \u201940 - \u201941, then \u201942 we had no more correspondence, they died."

And she gave him our money and for every 14 marks that we gave him, she met him in Belgium, he gave us back a dolla -- a mark. So we had little money as we left Belgium, and there were people who got off at Belgium and I remember waving goodbye to friends and then we never saw them again, and then we continued to Cuba."

            "answer": "Yes, we said goodbye to our friends who lived in the apartment house. And of course my close relatives, very fortunately were able to come with us. Uncle Ben, who was in the concentration camp, my Aunt Esther bribed a Gestapo and they let him out. Her story is that Hitler was willing for Jews to leave if they could get out somehow, and we -- she went ahead and got the papers and we -- as we said, a -- a vacation to Cuba, but our intention was never to stay in Cuba, to come to America."

It seemed like a very large ship, and we ate at a dining room table like you would, I don\u2019t know like a cruise liner, but to me it was a large ship and we had room to run around on the deck and my brother and I played on the deck. Oh well, my Aunt Ceeta, the younger of the three sisters that were coming over, because it was such a rough voyage her baby could not keep any food down and died on the ship. And I remember this, he was buried at sea, and my Aunt Ceeta never got over that. That was a trauma that stayed with her all her life."

            "answer": "Well, they were worried about what life would be like, they would talk about the language. My mother and my aunts started studying English, since that was our destination, in Germany. So they were studying even onboard, when they would sit out on the deck. They had their English-German dictionary and they would try to converse with each other in English. And then of course there was the problem of learning Spanish, which I don\u2019t think they studied until they got over to Cuba. So a lot of the time they were talking about how we would make a living -- how they would make a living and how they would get along with the language. That was the main topic of conversation."

I learned more when I came to the United States. Played with my cousins because we were all very close together. My father and my uncle were brothers and my mother and my aunt were sisters. So two mothers, two women married to two brothers -- two sisters married two brothers, so my relationship with my cousins were double, very close, almost like brothers and sister. I was the only girl, everybody else was a boy, so I had a very close relationship with Aunt Esther because she always wanted a girl."

I started studying English with my mother and my aunt there in Cuba. They would sit in the park while we played, and studied. And of course then I started learning English.

And we were in this country, in America, must have been at the beginning of 19 -- at least the middle of 1941, cause we moved to Miami, and then my father and my mother moved to Saint Louis for six months. They thought they could earn -- he could earn a better living up there. But that only lasted six months, then we moved back. But we have letters from my grandparents and my aunt who stayed in Poland addressed to us in 1941 in America, to -- in Saint Louis."

Not a concentration camp, but a camp to hold us until we could get settled in the country, and treated us very nicely. There was food morning, noon and night and they treated us to something that was their delicacy, but we didn\u2019t like it, was fried bananas. And we stayed there a few days and my Uncle Jassie, the one who signed the papers, he was living in Detroit, and I understand now he sent money to us every month, to mine -- all three families, so that we could survive in Cuba. The story I got from my father was that he immediately went to work, which he did, and earned money so that we could be supported. But he had help. But he did go to work, went to work on a bicycle in Cuba. Carried around the package that he was selling from door to door."

Then we moved to Miami Beach and we each lived in separate apartments 1n separate apartment houses and that worked out. And there again my father and my uncle did the same thing, they went out to -- well, they had connections already in the wholesale houses, bought -- then they bought a car, each of them had a car so they could drive around the greater Miami area, cause they went back to business in Miami, just a ride across the causeway. And I started going to school in South Beach elementary school and things got easier for me because I had learned the language. There was no anti-Semitism in Miami Beach because a lot of the people were Jewish. And there we did join a synagogue, Beth Jacob synagogue and I went to Hebrew school. And there we were able to live the Orthodox life that we had in Marktberg, Germany. Going to synagogue on Saturday and my brother even led the children\u2019s service. He had learned the Hebrew well enough that he could do that. And we made friends in school, and the school was close -- the South Beach elementary school, the school was close enough to the apartment, we would just walk back and forth and see our friends in school and then play with them after school."

And at that time I was able to communicate with them so that I wasn\u2019t -- I must have still spoken with an accent, but it didn\u2019t seem to affect the relationship I had with them, we were just friends.

Later on [indecipherable] when I was in eighth grade I helped my parents -- I knew the language by then so well that I helped my parents study for the citizenship, and -- I went over the questions with them, which was hard for my father. My mother could do it. Questions, you know, about American history. But then, of course, I was learning -- at that point I was learning about American history, and one of the teachers even asked me to write a report on my experiences. So I did, and I read it to the class, and then on the intercom. An-And that way the children knew, because they wanted them to know what was going on over in Europe. But the children themselves weren\u2019t that concerned about it. They were interested in surviving themselves."

I think by then the war had ended, so that I was reliving some of the history that people had gone through that these children and -- and these teachers didn\u2019t have -- really weren't involved in very much. I mean, luckily they were able to go on with their own life. Course there were young men who were dying over there, but most of the people just went on with their life in -- 1n Miami Beach. There was no big concern except war bonds and some rationing, things like that were going on. And in Miami Beach the soldiers were being trained for the American army, so we would hear them marching through the streets of Miami Beach. That was during the war. So I must have written the composition towards the end of the war, 1945. And we did invite soldiers over to have Passover with us. So we were able to do that, to share whatever we -- my father made, with other people."
