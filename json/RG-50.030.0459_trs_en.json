And instead of avoiding me, he struck me on -- on my -- on my back, because he wa-want -- he wanted me to go out of his way. This was the Gypsy, later he died, very probably.

And -- And then the -- the SS, it was -- the contact with the SS was not direct. The contact was every day, the so-called appelle, you know re -- what it is -- what it was. And -- And so, if -- if one person was missing, they had to start again, to count again, but it took hours, and you can imagine then, it happened to me, that th-the food was so horrible that I became a very gr-great diarrhea, and I couldn\u2019t go out, because we had to stay there, and I -- I -- I had no solution, so it went.

I -- What I don\u2019t understand, the logic of the whole thing, because if somebody was missing, it was not sure, and there never was one -- plus one, only minus one, and -- and they had to find out where it -- where he was.

And I think that this is the comment, and the exposition of this whole thing, too smooth, too delicate for this -- for this horror, which has been represented by the shoes. So therefore, I | think that what +eu-we are doing -- what you are doing, I am doing now, is finally, this is hopeless, and th-th -- it 1s not -- because I cannot tell you -- you -- you ask what was it like. The question is -- has been made in such a way that I understand that you will -- you cannot imagine what it was. In -- In no -- I -- I -- I know -- I know no human being capable of imagining such a horror. So this is -- this is not a -- this is not a normal level, you know. So this experience is not transferable. I made this experience, and now I -- it belongs to me, and -- and I -- it is one of my -- my greatest experiences of -- of -- of -- of life. But I cannot transfer it -- it -- it -- is the -- is the film of shi -- of Schindler, cannot | be a -- a realistic film, because you cannot find 200-two hundred actors, and to -- to lock them, and let them lose the weight. So this -- you can\u2019t -- you cannot do it. So if you can\u2019t, the pictures you will see will be wrong, and will not correspond to the -- to the reality. So this is not feasible. Only if somebody organized a ki -- a camp, and you went into the camp, but I d -- I don\u2019t wish you to go there, so these a -- it\u2019s an initial contradiction in the thing, and -- and I think that what we can, we have to do to -- not to live with every day, but to think of it, to do -- to know that this is not a normal museum, this is a museum of the death, and -- and this -- the whole story is the story of the death, and the death is -- the death -- death is horrible, it\u2019s horrible to die with 15 or fi -- 16. It\u2019s horrible to die, to -- I -- I knew a lady whose child, I don\u2019t know, three or four weeks old, Interview with George Kadar 63 April 24, 2000 have been -- have -- have -- have been taken away and killed, and not the lady. And the lady came back from the camp during this -- during her entire life, hi -- she lived with this -- with this dead baby. So, this is -- So this kind of atris -- of atrocities, if I tell you, and you -- you -- you write it down, somebody read it -- reads it, but it\u2019s still a piece of paper. So this is not imaginable, you -- you are -- you are asking concrete questions, and this is okay, but as I am not -- you -- you see that I was not able to ex -- to -- to -- to speak of the ambiance of the selected, because -- because it is -- it is -- it is horrible. Imagine 200 people in a -- in America, waiting on the electric chair together. What will they say? Who would cry, who would shout? So, but this is -- this is -- it cannot happen."

I met him once in the air -- the | air -- at the airport, and I told him who I was, that I was also in a concentration camp, etcetera, and I see -- and I ask him, what do you think, w-wouldn\u2019t it be better to -- to try to share this experience with other people having the same conditions, or similar conditions?

I think this is -- this must be the message of | everybody having survived this -- findecipherable}this horrible period of ya -- of -- of human history.
