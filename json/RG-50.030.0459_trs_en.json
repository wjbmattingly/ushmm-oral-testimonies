I remember of a scene [indecipherable] I -- I went Interview with George Kadar 47 April 24, 2000 somewhere, between two barracks, and behind me, a Gypsy with a baton. And instead of avoiding me, he struck me on -- on my -- on my back, because he wa-want -- he wanted me to go out of his way. This was the Gypsy, later he died, very probably. Then came the Polish kapos , an absolutely horrible, horrible part of humanity. They had the right, for instance, to -- apparently, because they did it, to exchange people selected for the -- for the gas, because they knew somebody, or -- in the meantime, I profited somewhere of f this attitude. And -- And then the -- the SS, it was -- the contact with the SS was not direct. The contact was every day, the so-called appelle , you know re -- what it is -- what it was. And -- And so, if -- if one person was missing, they had to start again, to count again, but it took hours, and you can imagine then, it happened to me, that th-the food was so horrible that I became a very gr-great diarrhea, and I couldn\u2122t go out, because we had to stay there, and I -- I -- I had no solution, so it went. And very bad sign, flies were coming -- is wa -- by the way, flies were the only animals we saw, plus the SS dogs, but there was no butterfly, nothing, no birds, just flies. And -- And so i-i-i-it was a extreme -- extremely bad, the appelle , and the -- but this has been ordered by the SS. I -- What I don\u2122t understand, the logic of the whole thing, because if somebody was missing, it was not sure, and there never was one -- plus one, only minus one, and -- and they had to find out where it -- where he was. So it -- it took time. The Jewish commanders, or the sous-commanders [indecipherable] were also quite bad because -- because they -- they -- they regularly stole the midare -- the -- the food. You know, I had a couple of times, contact with Mengele , because he came several times to select. And the selections, Interview with George Kadar 48 April 24, 2000 which, if you know what it was, first the -- the cynism , because the first selection took place on September 15 th, which was Rosh Hashanah . The second for Yom Kippur , so they -- they apparently knew the Jewish calendar. And then I -- I think that nobody spoke of the smiling side of Mengele . Mengele could smile, and he selected the deaths smiling, with rapture, a little bit. And if somebody didn\u2122t obey, then he became very angry. But he -- But otherwise, he was smiling, and -- to make this job. You know, there is something very perverse in the whole thing. For instance if the -- the Gauleiter gaulighter , or I don\u2122t know, the commander -- not commander, was something like that, commander -- I -- I -- I don\u2122t know [indecipherable] the military, or [indecipherable] the man who -- Frank , a very, very famous and a horrible man of Hitler, who was the commander of Poland, after having finished his job, he went home to play Bach on the piano, because this is German culture. I could tell you something else, which is perhaps not a direct answer [indecipherable] but the -- to understand this mentality, a -- a -- excuse me, but I -- I think I -- I will say it, if you don\u2122t want it, leave it out.

Go to my mother, the house is big, and you can -- you can take a rest -- at night.\ufb02 And we did this several times. In 1977, when our si thi-third boy was born, I -- I examined the boy, of Formatted: Font: Bold Formatted: Font: Bold Interview with George Kadar 49 April 24, 2000 course, as a good father, and I considered that his ears were a little bit different of the other ears of the family.

I think this is -- this must be the message of everybody having survived this -- [indecipherable] this horrible period of ya -- of -- of human history.
