When I first received Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection the letter from the United States Holocaust Museum about your visit to me, I -- I really, seriously began thinking about my life after liberation. And it seemed a good time, too. This is -- in the Jewish calendar, this is what we call the Assera siamata shuva, the 10 days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, where we are supposed to think about our lives and what we have done and have we done it correctly, have we any regrets? Would you like to do it any differently? And it seemed a very appropriate time to -- to -- to go through my 75 -- 75 and a half years on this earth and thank you for giving me that opportunity."

            "answer": "Sure. Pll be happy to do that. My maiden name was Schild, that\u2019s spelled S-c-h-1-I-d. My father\u2019s name was Siegfried Schild, good German name and he came from a very small town on the Mian river, by the name of Hessdorf. And he was a butcher and in those days, families had to marry off their sons and daughters for a purpose, so since he was a butcher, a -- my grandparents looked for an opportunity for him to marry into a butcher shop. It was as simple as that. That\u2019s the way it was 1n the olden days. And there was this Paula Yoksburger in Anspach, who was one of five daughters and her parents, my grandparents, Sophie and Gabriel Yoksburger were very hard up to marry off their five daughters without money. You see, in those days you needed to have money to marry off a daughter. And finally, they knew of this young man in Hessdorf who was looking for a -- what they called a shiduch, a -- a match between himself and someone who was somewheres in the butcher business. And it worked out fine, even though my mother was two years older and I\u2019m sure there was no great love, but it was a marriage in those days that was called very appropriate and very good and it -- 1t was fine."

And, as a matter of fact, he died very soon after his daughter\u2019s sa -- his -- his daughter Paula was married to this young butcher boy from Hessdorf and it -- it worked out just wonderfully. He died and the son-in-law stepped into the butcher shop in Anspach and there was my mother and father and soon after -- a year after the marriage there was one daughter, my sister Freidel and two and a half years after that, I arrived, Gerda. And the only regret my father had up to his dying day, that he didn\u2019t have a son. In Anspach, it would have been necessary to hand the butcher shop over to a son. But as it turned out, that reason fell completely away and I guess he got over not having a son. He -- he -- he was okay with his two daughters."

            "question": "Do you know anything more about your family in Anspach, how long they had been there and had been butchers?",
            "answer": "Yes, I did a little research on my family at one time. The Schild family -- the ones that lived in Hessdorf, my father\u2019s side of the family, apparently came out of Spain in the 17th or 18th century with that wave of emigration that -- that -- that was triggered by the e-emancipation in Spain. And apparently that\u2019s where my family comes from, because my Jewish na -- my Hebrew name is Sprinza, which 1s Esperanza for -- for a young girl. And apparently I had a grandmother or a great-grandmother or some female ancestor -- ancestress I would say, a female ancestor, who -- who was a Spaniard. And apparently that\u2019s what happened on my father\u2019s side. On my mother\u2019s side, the story is that we came- that they came from a very small town called Yoksburg and as you probably know, in - in the 18th century, the -- the Jews finally got last names. Up to then it was Moshe the butcher or Jakob -- Yakob the shoemaker, they didn\u2019t have names. And apparently, when they -- when the time came, when the decree was passed down that the Jews had to have names, many of them took the name of their town -- of the town they lived in. So that\u2019s why you have so many Berlinner and Hamburger and -- and of small tow -- Frankfurter or Kissinger. These are all people that came from particular towns and that\u2019s how my grandparents were named Yoksburger, because they had lived in a small town called Yoksburg, which is very close to Anspach. You must understand that, in opposition to America, where the Jews are all clustered and -- and congregated in large cities, this was not the case in Europe. In Europe, Poland, Germany and all the many countries of Europe, the Jewish communities -- the strong Jewish communities were in the small towns, because there the people left them in peace. There was always anti-Semitism, but in small towns, very frequently they were able to buy themselves the protection of the -- of the lord. They were called Markgraffen or whoever owned these little towns and by being servile to these feudal lords and being useful to them, they were able to get the protection and they settled in those small towns and they remained very Orthodox, many of them. There was nothing else, it was Orthodoxy or nothing."

            "question": "-- a strong community by the time that you are aware of it as -- as [indecipherable]",
            "answer": "Yes. Yes, I would. We had the -- we had a rabbi who was a -- a leader in -- 1n -- in the- in the ge -- in the European German commu -- Jewish community. His name was Eli Munck. He wrote several seminal books on -- on the pr -- the prayers, the world of prayer for instance and the call of the Torah. He was just a very great light in -- in Jewish intelligencia. And I -- Id like to say this, which many people forget. Th-Th-Th-The German rabbis were able to become so great and to devote themselves to writing because they were not hired by the community. Here, a rabbi is beholden to his board of directors and to his president and to the wives, in order to keep his job and he has very little time to- to -- to be independent, to think stuff on his own. But in Europe -- in Germany particularly, religion was a state -- spa -- state sponsored affair. Each one of us had to pay a religion tax and the Jewish religion tax went to pay the rabbis and upkeep the synagogues and the other -- the Christian religion tax went their way. So the rabbis were very free and we were very fortunate to have just two fantastic rabbis in a row. When I was very young, our rabbi was Pinhusk Horn, which was also a name that stands forever in -- in -- in Jewish history of Germany. And then we had this wonderful Eli Munck, who devoted himself to writing and to bringing up the youngsters, because he knew that the future of Judaism was in the youngsters. I -- I\u2019d like to say one other thing that only occurred to me very recently. Th-The rabbis in Germany did not urge the Jews to leave and I remember my parents holding that somewhat against Rabbi Munck. Why didn\u2019t he say, \u201cGo find yourself another place to go to.\u201d He never did. And it only occurred to me very recently that this was for the obvious reason that the rabbis were state employed, you see? Do you understand what I\u2019m saying? They couldn\u2019t say that or they -- or Hitler would have knocked them off in a minute. The rabbis were completely dominated by the state. And -- and the outgrowth of that thought is thank God for the separation of state and church in this country. So you -- you live a long time before these things really dawn on you. You know, we adored this rabbi and we believed everything he said and we did everything he said. But he didn\u2019t tell us to leave, you see? Think about that. Is -- it\u2019s really -- it\u2019s a revelation when that thought came to me. He himself left with his family, after awhile and saved himself and his many children, but he didn\u2019t tell us to leave."

He left and went to Paris afterwards and founded a -- a fine, deeply religious Jewish community in Paris, Ru cardet. And I\u2019m still very friendly with many of his children. Now, how did it affect me? I adored the man, you see? In -- in -- in Germany, the rabbi was somewhere between your father and God, equi-distance. And I particularly liked the Munck family. I was like a child in their house myself. And it didn\u2019t change my feelings toward him. Also, one of the reasons it didn\u2019t change my feelings toward him was when I was liberated -- and now I\u2019m jumping ahead several years -- when I was liberated to Switzerland and ended up in Montrou -- Seulemontre at Laisavont, I found out very soon that Eli Munck and his whole family had fled from Paris and had established themselves in Geneva. And once I knew that, I got in touch with him and he with me. And he was the first person I saw again, of my for-former life. You can\u2019t argue with feelings, you see? I loved the man and here I saw him again, after all I had gone through and I credited him in a way with my res- religiosity. He gave me that strong belief in God and he guided me through my younger years. My parents were busy and making a living and were very simple people, no education. And he -- he gave me a lot. I -- I didn\u2019t change my feelings toward him, I have to say. It should have, but 1-it didn\u2019t."

In the 70\u2019s -- in the 19 six -- late 60\u2019s or early 70\u2019s, he and his wife retired and came over here for the same reason we came to Minneapolis. They had children in -- living in New York and they came over to retire in New York. We were still living in Maine at the time and my -- my great admiration and love for him and his wife, went so far as to make a new friendship between them and my husband and myself. And we visited them several times in New York and he came up to Maine and stayed with us for awhile. And I have several letters by him and pictures of him. He was a smallish man, very trim, very neat. Little beard and dark, alert eyes and he had a little French sing-song accent in his voice, because he was actually born in Paris, but I don\u2019t remember how come. And his wife was a jolly, roundish, lovely woman, always smiling, always happy a-and I -- I just like them both."

            "answer": "No -- well, he was -- I -- I have to tell you a very funny story. When we came to Switzerland -- and I like to talk about that at some more length later on, but just now, in connection with my great friendship with Eli Munck, when I was liberated to Switzerland, we -- that whole transport, were again put into a lager -- into a concentration lager, it was nothing like what I just came out of, it was the grand hotel in mont -- in -- in Seulemontre, in Laisavont. I might have a picture of it, it was a gorgeous hotel that was emptied out for us, so that we -- these 12 hun -- it wasn\u2019t the whole group, it was maybe 300 people, could be put up in great comfort with this gorgeous view of Lake Geneva below us and Montplant on the other sides and -- and all the mountains around us, so don\u2019t think it was a -- a concentration camp, but it was a concentrating lager so that we could be controlled. We couldn\u2019t roam around. We had to check in and check out, we had guards on the doors. We had to always be in -- tell them where we went. And so, I wanted to visit my beloved Rabbi Munck in Geneva. And somehow -- I don\u2019t know how, I got myself a ticket to -- to go there on the -- on the train. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s very -- it\u2019s a very short distance, as you know. It\u2019s just a -- a little bit around on the lake of Geneva. And I asked for permission to -- to go and the permission was denied. And you know what I did? I left secretly, on my own, to see my beloved rabbi. And you know what happened? Two Swiss policemen caught me on the train station in Montrou as I was just about to step onto that train and took me back and put me into what was like a -- a little solitary confinement. Again, in great luxury, but it was a locked door and a locked window and I had my food passed in and out. This because I needed so badly to see the rabbi and his family. Can you believe it?"

I thought -- I thought this was more important than -- I c -- I couldn\u2019t even understand why they didn\u2019t grant me the -- so then, to follow up on the story, I -- the rabbi heard about it, because I had told them to meet me at the train, so I had to somehow tell them that I was now imprisoned at the Grand Hotel in -- in Laisavont, so they came to see me. And I don\u2019t believe that they let me out. I think we talked through the window. I -- I don\u2019t have a recollection of actually seeing them, but we saw each other and -- and it was just wonderful. So then afterwards, when things loosened up a little -- this was very soon after I got there and in a way I really don\u2019t blame them. We weren\u2019t allowed to roam Switzerland at will, so here was my -- my petition was denied, but then after awhile -- this was in February, or say March, then in April, at Paisa -- Passover time, they allowed me to join the Munck family for Paisa. The things that I remember now, after all these years. And the funny thing 1s, tho-those Munck children, who were then -- well, the oldest daughter is six years younger than I am, so I was 20 -- I was 23 when I got out of -- was I? I think I was 20 f -- 23 or four when I got out of Theresienstadt. So she was six years younger and she remembers this very well. I\u2019m still in great contact with them. She is now |-lady -- the Lady Acobowitz. She 1s now the -- the wife of the Chief Rabbi of -- the former Chief Rabbi of England -- of Great Britain.

            "answer": "Good question, good question and it\u2019s a question that is to date unresolved, but Ill -- Pll try to go back. I ca -- I come from a very basic Orthodox family. No great learning, but just simple, basic belief that God wrote the Torah and whatever is in the Torah, because God wrote it, you obey it. You don\u2019t ask why, you don\u2019t argue, you don\u2019t go into discussions, you just do it. This actually helped me, because I so basically and -- and organically believed all this. You see, you say your night prayers every night, you get rid of all the bad things that happened during the day and you only focus on -- on -- on asking for the good things, for the health of your parents and your grandparents and your sister and your teachers and your rabbi. And this helped me a great deal because unquestioningly, I believed that right through the Holocaust. I remember having the first qualms about it, when I actually learned that my mother and sister had been killed so cruelly. My mother, this religious person who gave me all that wonderful belief, how could she have been killed? And my sister, who believed just as I did? And I -- I remember changing places, actually, with God. I -- my belief was always I had to account for the things I did wrong and all of a sudden it occurred to me, what about the things God did wrong? Doesn\u2019t He have a responsibility to me too, that He killed my mother and my sister and my aunts and uncles and cousins. All my friends, everybody I had with the all -- sole exception of my father. And you know, you are -- you were so ingrained with that fear of coming up to heaven when you die and you have to give an account of yourself and it occurred to me very suddenly, God will have to give an account to me, too. And from then on, my faith reverted itself. I remember that very clearly, because it was a great struggle. My father remained completely religious. I asked him once what he thought of his wife and daughter being slaughtered like -- li -- like -- like the 6,000,000 were and everybody knows now -- we didn\u2019t know at the time and we didn\u2019t want to know. But once we knew how they died, I asked him once, \u201cDoesn\u2019t that impair your faith a little bit?\u201d He said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s the way God wanted it. God did it. God gave them life and God took it away.\u201d I guess it\u2019s one way of looking at it. We never ask why we are born, so we really have no reason to ask why he takes life away from us. But anyway, what was your question? How it impair -- so now my -- I\u2019m still Orthodox. I still observe all the things that I learned in my youth. Number one, because I never wanted to disappoint my father. Number two, because I married a very religious man and number three, it -- 1t gives meaning to my life, you know? You observe the holidays, it\u2019s great, the family gathers around the Yuntive table and -- and you go to synagogue. But that basicness that I have mentioned before, that -- that organic feeling, that\u2019s gone. Now I observe the religion for -- for other reasons. Because I -- I have to do something. I have to believe in something. And also, one of the great reasons that I -- I still -- that I haven\u2019t changed my ways at all is that actually God was very good to me. Look at my life. I have a great husband, I have four very, very nice children. I have four very nice in-law children. I have 11 grandkids. Not one of them is retarded or has crooked teeth or -- or cross-eyed or club feet. They\u2019re all great people. So how can I not be grateful? How can I Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection - how can I be so arrogant as to say, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe any more.\u201d I di -- I didn\u2019t deserve it. I didn\u2019t deserve this 50 years of sunshine in my life. So I live with the -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B"

            "answer": "Yes, I -- I\u2019d like very much to talk about that. Let me just go back a little bit. After I left my parents home, at the age of just barely 18, just after my 18th birthday, in 1941 and- in 1940 -- and went to Berlin to train as a nurse, I did -- I -- I joined the Jewish hospital in Berlin, asking immediately to be put onto the kosher side. At that point there was still a small table of kosher people and actually, I was able to eat kosher throughout those years that I was in -- in the Jewish hospital in Berlin. I don\u2019t think I observed the Sabbath quite the way I -- I should have, but I surely didn\u2019t go out and -- and gallivant around. I may have worked, but I didn\u2019t do anything else. And then when I got to Theresienstadt -- and this 1s all still radiating from my childhood, you see, unquestioningly what ga -- God does, is the right thing. And then I got to Theresienstadt and then of course the food became a big problem.

And in Theresienstadt, I did continue my -- my nightly prayers. That became a habit, it made me feel good. I could fall asleep easily and I felt it was just very necessary to pray for my people. I knew they weren\u2019t sitting on beds of roses. And I didn\u2019t know where my father was and how he was faring and of course I always prayed that I would see everybody again. And I -- I think that answers your question."

Up to then, you know how it 1s, 1f you don\u2019t see them die, they are not dead. Oh yes, 6,000,000 were killed, but not my mother and not my sister.

I guess it was when my father remarried. I guess then I finally gave up. But for a- for a long time you -- you just -- you just don\u2019t want to believe that. I -- I\u2019d like to say something about death as such. Th-The -- my mother, of course, as I have said in my previous interview, was killed in Riga and most probably in -- in the woods in front of the firing squads. And it was a long, long, long, many years before I could say that without breaking down. And I\u2019m not even sure I can do it now. And my sister -- it\u2019s not very clear to me whether she was killed in -- in Auschwitz or also in front of a firing squad, but again, after I knew all that, I was still hoping maybe they died already in the -- in the trains, so that they wouldn\u2019t have to -- to do that horrible end. But I wanted to say something about my father\u2019s death. My father died in 1986, only 12 years ago, at the age of 92. And I, at that time was about 65 years old, is that correct? Or 63? Anyway, I was a- certainly a very middle aged woman. And until then, I had not seen a relative of mine die of a natural death. And you know, it was almost a jubilation that I was able to see someone die naturally. That I -- I -- that I could sit Shiva, that I could all the things that one does for the dead. And I -- I -- I remember almost a feeling of joy. Of -- of -- of -- of fulfillment. It was very strange."

            "answer": "Well, I was in very good shape. Number one, I was young. And number two, I had worked myself up into a nurse\u2019s position 1n -- into a supervisory nurse\u2019s position in the children home. And that meant I got S ration -- r-ration -- special ration. I had no longer to go with my little food pot to -- to the window where they dished out a little ladle of soup and the next one pushed right after me and I had to leave. The soup was now brought to the children\u2019s home and we had enough of that. Also, at that point -- I\u2019m sure I spoke of that in my earlier recollections, I -- I had a young man who -- who liked me very much. It didn\u2019t amount to anything because you know, we had curfew, we couldn\u2019t get together, but he -- he just adored me. He was the brother of one of the women whose baby was in the nursing home. So he came and he -- he worked in the co -- into -- in the concentration camp\u2019s bakery. And he, from time to time, brought me and my f -- and the woman I lived with, Eva, my girlfriend Eva, bread. And of course that was a lifesaver. It really, really was. And also -- you see, the Swiss people -- the -- I\u2019m sorry, the Czech people that were in Theresienstadt were allowed to get packages and from time to time, the Czech women that we -- we lived with in that basement of ours, below the children\u2019s home, would grudgingly share their apples or their little bits of f-food that they had, with us. There was a great divide between the Czech prisoners and us, but once in awhile they s -- they had pity on us. So I was in pretty good condition and I was picked because I was in good condition. We all -- y-you know the story how I was saved. It was 1200 Jews, each one of them had to appear before the Commandant Ram and we were picked for our looks, you see. If we were dehydrated and emaciated, out. So I was number seven -- s -- I was number 1174 and Eva was 1173 and we looked good, so we left. And on the train to Theresienstadt, we got all those delicacies that we didn\u2019t even know what they were. Who had [indecipherable] -- who had ever seen a banana before? Who knew what a sardine looked like? So we gorged ourselves before we even got to Switzerland and in Switzerland -- I do need to say something about the feeling that is still so vivid with me, of freedom. Wh-What actually is freedom? Freedom at that point was air that smelled good. Air that you could take in and breathe. And people who were smiling. People on the -- on the station that looked up and smiled at you. People who didn\u2019t wear stars and had nice clothes and stockings on. And mainly, freedom was people in uniform that didn\u2019t hit you. People in uniform that spoke courteously to you. And freedom was beautiful landscape and -- and -- and -- and looking out the window and not being shouted at or shot at. And -- and freedom was just a -- a great relief. And also freedom was not to have -- Ill say it in -- not in the negative, but in the positive, freedom was to have lights at night, to have a ci -- a -- a city lit up, you see? I had lived 12 years and six of tho -- 12 years in Nazi regime and six of those in war and every night you were taken to prison if you had a little light shining through. And here was this Switzerland with all the lights blazing. I couldn\u2019t get over it the first night. Why aren\u2019t they tel -- why aren\u2019t they blacking out their -- it was -- don\u2019t you forget, it was still war. I got to Switzerland in February -- 12th, I believe. And the war didn\u2019t end and they had all their lights on. That\u2019s freedom."

I don\u2019t recall that particular -- I think it was when I looked out the window and saw the people smiling and that was all -- what I have said there in such verbiosity was all just one little moment in my life. We got into Switzerland, th-the SS came thr -- it wasn\u2019t the SS any more, it was the -- the Red Cross people came through, told us to rip off the star and put up -- put on lipstick and we opened up the windows. And then the Swiss p -- the Swiss gendarmes in their uniforms came through. I think that was the moment. And they called us nice, with names and smiled and -- and asked what we wanted and we looked -- I remember that, looking out the window, so we would le -- Eva and I -- Eva and I were inseparable at that point and Pll have something to say about that in a moment. But I remember we let down the window and looked out and we smelled that air and -- of course, I\u2019m repeating myself, but that was -- I think that was the moment. I -- I wanted to just say something about Eva and I being so inseparable and it ties in with the questions about religion that you asked before. Eva was not religious and she opted -- wh-when we got to Sengale and we had a list of -- of so -- so-called concentration hotels that we could request and she wanted to go to Les Auvants, there were others who off -- other ki -- hotels or places that offered kosher food, which I would have chosen. But she wanted so much to go to Les Auvants and I did not want to lose her, that I went to Les Auvants with her. And I remember that I- that I didn\u2019t eat the meat then any more, because I was so close to my old rabbi again. But anyway, I didn\u2019t stay in Les Auvants very long and -- and then I went to an old friend of mine from -- from the city of Kissingin, that I found in Lucerne. And there again, you see, Kissinger 1s named because he came from that city of Kissingin, where I had a close friend. And when this friend of mine from -- formerly from Kissingin whose name was -- was Truda Lustig at the time, but who had married a Swiss guy by the name of Erelinger. When she heard that I was in that Les Auvants transport, she immediately requested that I come to her home and there I was completely rehabilitated to Kashrut and Shomair Shabbat and the whole bit.

Because we were frightened, we thought the SS were reaching -- we -- we had been living in fear for 12 years. In fear for our possessions and our lives and our people. Fear doesn\u2019t go away the minute you open a window and smell freedom. So, yes, I would say we did. But I -- I -- let\u2019s be sure that I say something about that fear that had repercussions to this very day. I'll -- Pll -- I'll say it later, you had some other questions, didn\u2019t you? Perhaps I\u2019d better say it now, because 1-it does fit into the fear business. When we got to Les Auvants, after he had told us to remember him kindly, I forgot that. Consciously I forgot it, but very obviously, sub-consciously I didn\u2019t, because when we got to Les Auvants, one of the first things I needed to do, was to write down things from the past 12 years. I don\u2019t know what the other people did, but I si-simply had this -- this - this need to get rid of all this. You see, here -- here I came out of Theresienstadt into this luxury hotel with all the food I wanted, with that view in front of me and I needed a transition. And so I asked for a typewriter and -- and some paper, which I got and I stayed in my room for several days and just catharsis. And -- and then I met -- how I met Dr. Clay, I do not remember. I think I met him through Eli Munck. I met -- I met a man by the name of Dr. Clay, who was an official with the Swedish embassy -- embassy, I believe. He -- he was high up. And when he heard that I had written things down, he wanted it. And I let him have a copy of everything I wrote, with the condition that he not use my name. I still have his letter -- I can show it to you, where he answers me that he will of course honor my request. He would like to publish what I wrote, but he will not name me, Gerda Schild, by name. Now, in the 19 -- late 1980\u2019s or even 90\u2019s, I read a book -- I forgot the name of the author, we can look it up, by the title \u201cStella\u201d, a famous book where a -- a Berlin -- a survivor of the Holocaust who stayed in Berlin, one of the hidden Jews, writes about Berlin. And I read this book with such intensity, because I was there. He talks about street corners where I lived and places where I was. And I come across a section in the book that was my voice. I -- I could -- I could tell, 1t was -- I said that. It was the story of when the nurses came to -- were taken to the Kasalen to help these people a-at the Fabric transport. And here I am reading, and I said to my husband, \u201cThis is my story.\u201d And I go quick and I see -- I see where he got this from, he -- it\u2019s a very well documented book. I forgot his name, I can look it up. And he -- he documents my story, anonymous nurse from Berlin and I -- I look and see where he got it from and by God, he got it out of the publication of Dr. Clay from Geneva. I wrote to him and I documented -- I wrote him a copy of that letter where Dr. Clay said he will publish it, but without a name and I was really hoping to hear from, but he never answered. He never answered and that was, of course, at least six or seven years ago. But, you see, that\u2019s how the ripple of fear goes to -- to 1990. Here I realized -- and this document of Dr. Clay, I see by his notes -- by his footnotes, is in the librar -- in th -- in the library -- in the national library of Paris, the French National Library of Paris. Isn\u2019t that some story? I had goosebumps when I read that. But the interesting thing is that I kept the Clay letter, that I know that is my story without my name."

He lived in Nuremberg and he came to Anspach all the time to -- to -- so to say, visit his relatives, but he really came to visit me. And we had, you know, one of those very innocent, very naive romances. Even so -- oh, I was very young then, I was maybe 15 or 16 and he wasn\u2019t much older. And the only way that I was allowed to at all go out with him was that my parents said to themselves, \u201cWell, he\u2019ll marry her eventually.\u201d Oh, that was the whole shooting match. He liked me enough to really wanted to marry me and he came -- must I tell you all this? On the day of my engagement to my husband, he came to the door with roses and a little package. Very obviously he was going to ask me that day to marry him. So he was more serious than I. But at that point I had already given my hand and heart to Rudy Haas.

But no, he did everything he could also, to get me over. And we saw each other again in -- just -- just during the Passover holidays of 1946. I arrived by ship and he, being a very religious man, did not come to pick me up. He stayed in that place where he -- he went to Boston, I arrived in Boston. And he had been settled in New York. And he had asked someone -- I guess from the -- from the Joint or something to pick me up. He did not consecrate the holiday to drive to pick me up. I -- I didn\u2019t question that at the time.

I was real-really not that badly off after I heard how everybody else had suffered. I wanted to say something about living with my friend in Lucerne and that goes to the point I have made before, that the Holocaust governs my whole life. So in Lucerne, in 1945, when I was rescued and my friend took me in, I took care of her two little kids so that she could go to work. I was like an au pair, you know? And that was a very happy time, it was a vibrant, Jewish, religious family. And Rosh Hashanah came and always the -- the husband brought home stray people from the synagogue to have holidays with -- with the family. And, you know, I helped in the kitchen, I was st -- you know, I was busy with the whole affairs and I didn\u2019t pay too much attention whom he brought home. He brought home some American soldiers that year, 1945, to celebrate the Rosh Hashanah holiday with him. Now I am going to 1985, AO years later and I\u2019m -- I\u2019m teaching elder hostel at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine and I -- I am teaching the Holocaust, upon the request of elder hostel. And I have my -- I tal -- taught that for 10 years. It was a very successful course and I -- I have very good memories of telling people what the Holocaust was all about. Not just what I\u2019d gone through, but the -- the historical background, I -- I started with anti-Semitism in Germany and --and how Hitler at all got to power and -- and somehow, within that two week course, naturally, I legitimized myself and said that I was there, too, and how I had been saved and went to Switzerland and how I had stayed with this Erelinger family. And in one of my courses, one white haired man gets up and he says to me, \u201cYou state you were very religious at the time and you went to America and you married a physician, didn\u2019t you?\u201d And I was completely taken aback and I said, \u201c\u201cWho are you?\u201d And he was one of the soldiers that Erelinger brought home. And I had corresponded with him, I had a little bit of a romance with this handsome soldier, he took me out and you know. And I had rome -- I had co-corresponded with him and I had told him, \u201cSorry, I got to stop this now, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m getting married next week to this young doctor.\u201d So he recognized me from what I told him."

I had only known buildings where you walk in and you\u2019re in the living room and dining room and the kitchen and out the door into the garden and upstairs were the bedrooms. Well, this was an apartment building where a whole city lived. You walked in and you had to take the elevator up to the sixth floor and then you were confronted by long, dark, usually smelly corridors and from the corridor, on each side, doors entered. And little did I know that every single door was a whole apartment in itself. I\u2019d never seen a construction at -- like that. In fact I -- I tried to explain it to one of my friends 1n letters and they couldn\u2019t picture it at all, either. So anyway, we went through a door, number 6B, I think. And there, al-all of a sudden, it opened up into a re-regular apartment. But you just couldn\u2019t tell that from that dark corridor.

And so they transferred all their pettiness and all their parochialism and all their pedestrianism to this beautiful city and they just lived within that gorgeous city, still in their old, little hometown of -- of maybe 2,000 people.

First of all, at that point, 1t was not so accepted to go to the psychiatrist, so we -- we went to a psychiatrist in the next town, Portland and I think my husband drove me down each time. I think so. And he a-asked about the -- the past and the Holocaust, something about the Holocaust and my life. And he also noticed that I had a guilt complex. And then he told me that I was perfectly normal and that people who go through very great traumatic experiences and come out alive, whereas other people die, as for instance in the plane crash or any natural disaster, do end up with a guilt complex and he thought that was quite normal. And once I knew that, I could deal with it. I didn\u2019t go many times. He was very good and very kind and -- and I could deal with it. Interesting enough, though, I -- I got over it and I adjusted okay, but three of my four children ended up going to a psychiatrist or a psychologist in -- in their formative years.

I know for instance that -- w-we never talked about the Holocaust and we never talked German, but once the children knew that I had been in a concentration camp and -- and I\u2019I1 tell you in a minute how they found that out, then I began to realize that they were reading under their covers at night with flashlights, books about the Holocaust, but they didn\u2019t dare to ask me, so they visualized that I went through the worst of what they were reading and I think that was the cause of their -- of their m-maladjustment. And how did they find out? Because after I went to college, at age 49 and then to grad school and became a librarian -- that was in \u201874, early -- maybe even before then -- then I became a book reviewer for the Library Journal and for some of the Jewish magazines.

            "answer": "Yes, I will, but first I want to say this, my -- my children, in a way, by osmosis almost, surmised what was going on and yet, they didn\u2019t really understand. I -- I\u2019m sure I spoke about this when I was interviewed the first time, but 1t seems important enough now maybe just to touch on it once more without going into too much detail. When I was -- when I was asked to be a member of the state Board of Education in Maine, I accepted, of course, greedily and then I -- a phone call came -- or rather a notice came that my confirmation hearing was on -- on a certain date in September and I looked at my calendar, it was the second day of Rosh Hashanah and I didn\u2019t travel then. So, I talked to my husband and he said, \u201cWell, you have to call up and tell them you can\u2019t come and probably they\u2019ll pick someone else.\u201d So I called up and it was the Senator Katz who was on the phone, who was the chairman and of course, obviously he was also Jewish and he was such a nice guy, I became very close friends with him later. And I said to him, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t travel on the second day of Rosh Hashanah. I can\u2019t come.\u201d And he was quiet for a minute and then he said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m Jewish too, I never even knew there was a second day of Rosh Hashanah.\u201d And so we talked about that for awhile and then he said, \u201cWell, then we\u2019ll postpone the hearing for a week -- for a --\u201d I don\u2019t know how long. And I was just flabbergasted that this senator from Maine ju -- postponed a hearing for me, who was persecuted for being Jewish. And I talked about that werbar in front of the kids. And my daughter Heddy, the one who\u2019s living here now, said -- still ringing in my ears and she said to me -- she was then about, oh, maybe 14 or 15. She said, \u201cWhy -- why do you think that\u2019s so -- so -- so noteworthy? Naturally, if you can\u2019t come because of religious reasons, they have to postpone the date for you.\u201d You know, and I -- then I was even more flabbergasted, that my own kid didn\u2019t understand what -- what it means to- not to live in a democracy. I -- I -- I don\u2019t know if you understand the bigness of that thing. It was such a revelation to me, such an epiphany. And -- and then -- then I probably explained to her at that point that not everybody grows up in a democracy and has democracy in their bloods -- in their bloodstreams, with their mother\u2019s milk. Well, in that case, it wasn\u2019t the case but -- but obviously she was American enough not to understand that this -- a senate does not have to postpone a hearing for a Jewish woman. So then I wrote my book. And the book just came out of me, because I thought, \u201cIf my own kids don\u2019t know it, other kids don\u2019t know it either.\u201d And I -- I wrote my book then. I- it was the first one, it\u2019s in the preface. The whole preface, that\u2019s why I wrote the book, for my kids and for other kids, who grow up blithely and -- a-and then, of course, as I was writing and researching and talking about it and speaking, then the kids know everything. The kids also didn\u2019t want to know all that much. The grandchildren want to know more then the kids now. But the grandchildren already don\u2019t understand it any more. They don\u2019t understand it any -- \u201cWhat did Hitler look like? Did he come and kill your mother hi-himself?\u201d You know, things like that. \u201cWhat are you going to say to him when you meet him in heaven?\u201d There, at least I had an answer. I\u2019m not going to meet Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection him in heaven. I ain\u2019t going there, where he is. So, anyway. Yes, now I want to tell you about my oldest son. Somehow I -- I always felt -- or at least I rationalized -- for lack of any other rationalization, that I was saved so that I could have children and -- and somehow continue the -- the -- the re -- the depleted Jewish people. So, I quickly had my four kids and -- and I\u2019m sure that feeling translated itself in -- imbued itself into my kids. They too should have kids and grandkids and the Jewish race should -- should keep going in spite of Hitler. Hitler did not win. He did not eradicate us all. We, the survivors are starting again. And after my son was married for many years and didn\u2019t have children, he confessed to me once that this is a -- a very big problem for him because he fee -- he feels he has let me down, that he has not continue -- that I was saved and he -- he is not continuing this. And of course, I was flabbergasted to hear that and I assured him that he has not let -- now, mind you, he\u2019s a psychologist himself, he doesn\u2019t have to go to a psychologist, he is one. So he and I talked at length and he understood then that -- that he did not let me down and I never felt let down by him. On the contrary, I -- I\u2019m just extremely proud of all my kids and especially of him. And then, shortly after that he -- he adopted a little girl and she\u2019s now five and she\u2019s -- 10 months ago he adopted a little boy and now he feels whole. He has two children, that name will continue, the children have both come here to our synagogue to be -- to go to the Mikvah to become Jewish and of course the boy had his circumcision here and I ha -- my son, honestly, he\u2019s a different person since then. His head is up high and his chest is out and -- and he and I are -- are very close again. So -- Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection"

            "question": "Can you tell us the names of your four children?",
            "answer": "Oh yes, of course I can, my whole pride and joy. With the children, I felt I had paid my dues, at least to God and to the Jewish community. And then the other dues I paid, I want to tell you after I tell you the children\u2019s name. So I\u2019m looking at this picture here, which was taken at the brit of my oldest son\u2019s little boy. And it\u2019s in front of the Kineset Isel synagogue, with the name clearly visible. So there\u2019s my husband and I and in the center iv my -- 1s my son Leonard. Now mind you, all my kids are named after the parents we lost. So Leonard -- which is a burden, actually. The kids say it is a burden. Leonard is named after my husband\u2019s father, Leonard. And next to him is my daughter Heddy, who is named after my husband\u2019s mother, Hedwick. And on his other side is my son David, who is named after a distant grandfather and here is my daughter Pauli, who is named after my mother, Paula. And then, these are their -- their mates and then in front you have the next generation and of course their names are picked out of a hat and in fact, it is very interesting. You know, Hitler had -- one of the many laws that he made against the Jews was that the Jews had to have what he thought was degrading names like Sarah and Jacob and Moses and Daniel. Those were names that only Jews should have. And the interesting fact is that all my grandchildren have Jewish and Hebrew names, not because Hitler decreed it, because those names are beautiful and they like them. The only one that doesn\u2019t have a Jewish name, actually, is the two adopted kids. But it\u2019s no problem. So there\u2019s Rachel and there is Tally and Ari. And not on the picture are Sarah and Jonathan and Benjamin and Raphael. And the two kids of my old -- of my youngest son\u2019s, which Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection weren\u2019t born then -- oh yes they were -- is Jacob and Evan. Isn\u2019t that a great -- nice picture of my family and -- and I\u2019m very proud of them. So I have fulfilled my duty there and then -- and then I want to just mention a little bit that I have also fulfilled my duty to- to this country, because after all, I owe it quite a debt. Quite a debt. And in that way I\u2019m very glad that I moved to small town, but that was very se -- very secondary, only after I lived there for many years in -- in Lewiston, Maine, population maybe 60 -- maybe 50,000. Only after I lived there for a long time, did I realize that the population, the general American population knows very little about Judaism and almost nothing about the Holocaust. And so I -- I really found a fulfilling role for myself. By that time I was a - a librarian at Bates College in Lewiston and when we first moved there, in 1947, Bates College had only one Jewish professor and did not acknowledge the needs of the Jewish students. Holidays, no time off. Kosher food never was heard of. Jewish subjects were never taught and so the Jewish population and also th-the non-Jewish population knew nothing. And I was able to change that. I -- I got myself some grants from the -- of course then the times were different, too. This was in the 1970\u2019s, 1980\u2019s, I got myself some sizable grants from the Maine Human -- Council of the Humanities and with the blessing and -- and the encouragement of the Bates College president, I -- I conducted several Jewish oriented conferences. And they really went over big. This was for the whole state of Maine, we had a tremendous budgets, we -- the first conference I did was a month long. Just informational conference on Judaism and we moved from city to city, with people and -- and videos and we talked and we an -- mostly we answered questions and Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection many people in the hinterlands of Maine confessed that they had never seen a Jew before. So I -- I really felt proud about that. And then the next thing we did -- I was able to get a Jewish library -- a Rabbinic library for Bates College. The -- the -- the husband of the -- of the woman that had oppressed me so, the rabbi of -- of Lewiston died and -- and by then of course I was on -- on even terms with her and I was able to -- to coax her into donating his whole Rabbinic library in toto to Bates College. And it\u2019s known now as the Rabbi David Berund Rabbinic Library of Bates College. And I\u2019m proud to say that I did it. And I catalogued it -- took me several years. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a nice -- nice legacy. And then we did s -- then again I got f-funding for several Jewish events -- Jewish music. And that was all within that library, I got money for that and I was able to do a David Berund event annually. And once I did a music -- Jewish music and the other time we did Jewish films and next time we did Yiddish. And I got good speakers and we always had standing room only. It was fabulous, it was like they needed to hear about Judaism. Not only the Jews, but the non-Jews as well. The students, the professors, the townspeople, the out of townspeople. Was fabulous. And out of that -- when I realized the need, out of that, I -- then we did Holocaust conferences, especially with teachers. And again I felt this - this void. This -- this -- this -- this magnetic need that I had and then we finally got together and we had a little bit of money left from the last conference- oh, I don\u2019t know, maybe a thousand dollars and of course we were obliged to return it to the -- to the main Humanities Council, but we asked and got permission to keep it as seed money to found the Holocaust Human Rights Center of Maine. And we were just sailing through that. It was like they just waited for us. The Maine State Library sponsored us, we had our meetings there, they did all our cataloguing, all our mailing, all our newsletter, our videota -- I did a complete video and oral history tape of all the survivors in my -- Maine is such a small state, all we had was 25 survivors and maybe less than a dozen t -- much less than a dozen liberators. And we -- we -- we interviewed them all. We also interviewed non-Jewish people. Our criterion for survivor simply was anyone whose life has been dramatically changed because of Hitler. And that included a lot of non-Jewish, too. We had a lay -- a layer of -- a s -- of a small town in Poland who wouldn\u2019t go along with him and had to leave, with his whole family. And we had a former Nazi woman who then completely turned around and married a Jewish soldier and came over to Maine and became completely de-Nazified and -- and talked about -- and she wrote a book called, \u201cPoison in my Roots.\u201d She talked about h-h-how she couldn\u2019t help being a Nazi, there was nothing else. If she wasn\u2019t a Nazi, she was going to be shot, as simple as that. And she explained that to us. So I -- I really am feeling so -- so pleased. We got funding from people we -- we didn\u2019t even approach. People came to us with -- with thousands of dollars. It was just fabulous. Today we are a functioning, vibrant, rich, busy center."

            "answer": "I -- [just want to continue on some of the things we did in Maine. After we founded the Holocaust center, we had an annual reception for survivors and liberators at the Blaine House, the State House in Augusta, Maine, with the governor presiding and somebody giving a speech and the Mrs. governor passing around the famous cookies and things like that. And it was always something I -- I personally felt somewhat responsible for, so I always walked around and greeted everybody and made sure they felt welcomed and made su -- and I -- I knew most of them, anyway. And they knew me, too and -- and one year, I saw a man standing aside and I didn\u2019t know him and I couldn\u2019t place him, he didn\u2019t look old enough to be a survivor. He looked at least 10 years younger than I. And he certainly didn\u2019t look like a liberator. The liberators by then, all had a certain look. They were a little bit on the heavy side, gray hair -- you know, salt of the earth kind of people. And he didn\u2019t look like that, he looked quite elegant and quite aloof and I Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection thought, \u201cWho is he?\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, no -- no time is lost in finding out.\u201d And I marched right up to him, after all, I acted a little bit like the -- like the hostess in that\u2019s -- in that context and I said, \u201cI\u2019m Gerda Haas. Welcome to our reception. May I ask who you are? Are you one of our survivors or one of our liberators?\u201d And he -- he clicked his heels you know and gave me a salute. He was in civilian clothes, of course, just with a military insignia on his lapel. And he said, \u201cI am Colonel Retired Manfred Kelman, US Regiment --\u201d and I think he named it, which I have forgotten by then. And I was taken aback and I said, \u201cSo you are one of our liberators?\u201d He said, \u201cNo. I am a survivor. I was in Theresienstadt.\u201d And I was completely baffled. He didn\u2019t look old enough and he didn\u2019t look Jewish and he didn\u2019t look like a survivor. Neither did he act like one. So he and I huddled a little bit, because I couldn\u2019t spend too much time, but we made a date and we met later for coffee. And the fellow tells me he was a Mishling. He was brought up by a Jewish father and an -- and an Aryan SS mother. And he was 14 years old when the Nazis finally yanked him out of his house. Up to now his mother could keep him and kept her eye on him and he was a little bit protected. Also, as he told me later, he had a miserable childhood. He was neither Jewish nor Aryan. So anyway, by the age of 14, he was sent to Theresienstadt and there he was again miserable, because he wasn\u2019t a Jew and he had to wear the star all of a sudden and he had no friends. There was nobody 14 years old in Theresienstadt. And so finally at the -- at the end of the war, his mother sent an -- an -- a still functioning army car to pick him up out of Theresienstadt. But by gosh, the guy was in Theresienstadt just like me, a prisoner of the Nazis, with his star on his left hand side. And of course we became close friends. I just couldn\u2019t get over it. And as soon as he -- that finished it for him. As soon as he could, he took -- his father died in concentration camp and he took his mother out and came to America. And of course he was a youngster, so he got his education, enrolled into the army, rose to the level of Colonel, went back to fight the Nazis and retired to Maine because it was a nice state to retire in. How do you like that story? That\u2019s -- I should -- I should write that as a novel -- as a short story. I\u2019ve told it many times and it\u2019s just flabbergasting. So that\u2019s again the envelope of -- of -- of the Holocaust, of my life. And he was the nicest, nicest fellow."

I -- I think I have to say I was a little bit on the outside, by choice and by the rejection of my peers. And -- and I think I made my own little world. I mean, to begin with that I went back to college Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection at the age of 49. The people thought I was nuts. Here I was, married to a successful physician, why should I go to college like a little girl? And sure enough, I was the age of my professors. And that was kind of funny at times. But I went to college and then when I was done, I went to work. And in -- in 1971 that was not so common in a small town for a -- for the wife of a professional to do. So again, out of choice, I didn\u2019t have time for them and they rejected me because I went a different path. So, I had some close friends, but looking back, they were all Europeans. No, I won\u2019t say that, I have a couple that were Americans. But, pre-predominantly, my friends in -- in Maine were Europeans. And then I got so embroiled in the -- in all the activities that I have just described to you and then I got completely snowed under with the Holocaust center. And they -- they didn\u2019t take part in that at all. They did come through when I did Jewish music and Jewish this and Jewish that. That, they supported me in, but with the Holocaust they didn\u2019t support me all that much. And so I was on my own and I -- I was happy. I -- I was satisfied. I was different. That\u2019s very funny, I -- I am thinking of -- I -- I had a girlfriend who was also European and we chatted a little bit and our children were in the next room playing. They were small, maybe eight. And I hear one of them say, \u201cMy mother doesn\u2019t have an accent, your mother does.\u201d And I hear my daughter reply, \u201cNo, my mother doesn\u2019t have an accent, your mother has an accent.\u201d So I was different and yet I wasn\u2019t, you know? So, to answer your question, you know, it hurt at times when I wasn\u2019t invited or -- or I knew they were talking about me, or -- but you see, also I was very happily married. I -- I really- you know, what did I need? I had my kids, I had my husband, I still had my father at Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about this collection the time. And also, I did not get along with him as well as I should have. And I had my stepmother. I had them and they were -- and they were a responsibility as they became older, you see? So I -- I -- I was okay. I have no qualms. And then I became interested in other things and I wanted to build a nice life and -- and I -- I think I Americanized myself.

And that -- that is one of the laws of the -- of the Nazi party, the Jews have to be killed. But then practicality took over and they figured as long as we can squeeze a little labor out of them, let\u2019s work around that basic law and make a second law. And this law -- and I have it here, in -- in Xerox copy, th-the Wannsee Conference Law of 1942 states that when the people come to concentration camp, anyone under 18 is to be killed on arrival and anyone over 45 1s to be killed on arrival. And so they were. So that narrow gap, between 18 and 45 was allowed to sort of kill themselves. Die of natural causes, namely starvation and -- and h-hard labor and beatings and infections and finally then of course also, the gas chamber. So this should not be forgotten. So after we, who are now in our 70\u2019s, are gone, there are very few true survivors left, because of that ominous law of killing people under 18. When I tell that to students, that -- they really sit up and -- and take notice. It was really beastly. It was really beastly."

            "answer": "You're hitting all the right spots and some of them are sore. Yes, that was an ingrained instinct, not only because of the Nazis, but you know, we grew up obeying. We grew up obeying our parents and our grandparents and our teachers and our rabbis. And our -- our elders. That\u2019s how we were brought up. That was the Jewish way and of course the German way also. And then Hitler came upon the scene and suddenly we had to obey for very different reasons and -- and really k -- knuckle down and obey, or we were killed. There was no question about it. They came with their sticks and their dogs. And to this day I -- I\u2019m so uncomfortable around dogs and I think it\u2019s because of that. They always had their dogs with them. And we had to give up all our animals, you see, so that there\u2019d be no interaction with dogs or cats or anything, because they always had their dogs on their side. So here they came, a-an -- and we didn\u2019t even question obedience. We didn\u2019t even question it and I\u2019m ashamed to say it today. When they made us the -- the -- the -- the instigators of our own death, we obeyed. Why didn\u2019t we just lay down and die instead of -- instead of obeying them and ha -- aiding them? We were going to be killed anyway. You know that -- I don\u2019t think that occurred to us. We obeyed and that was all there was to it. That\u2019s the way -- you didn\u2019t know you could disobey. I -- we didn\u2019t know there was civil disobedience. That\u2019s an American institution. We didn\u2019t know that. So we obeyed. Now, to come to this -- to the present, how did I deal with it over here? I have to really think. Yeah, we were shocked at the time when the 60\u2019s came and -- and the ki -- and our own kids were sitting s-sit-outs or sit-ins? Sit ins. I was shocked. That didn\u2019t occur to us. And we didn\u2019t al-allow our kids to disobey very much either. It really was ingrained. I guess 1n a way it still is. I guess in a way it has never quite left. I remember -- I remember very well that I was married for 19 years and I finally one day stood up to my husband. And it\u2019s a strong memory. I thought, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m married 19 years and this is the first time I\u2019m speaking back to him.\u201d I-It -- you just didn\u2019t. But, of course the circumstances were different. Nobody yells at me now or orders me to do things. I do it because I want to. So I think some of that is still with me. I -- I think it is. And the obedience to God, that really never quite left me either. That is the best I can explain it. But, of course I\u2019m very much my own person now. I hope. I am. I don\u2019t know if that answers your question, but it\u2019s about all I can do. But you know, there is a certain freedom in obedience also. I\u2019m free to -- to do as I wish, e1-either to go along with what\u2019s expected of me, or not to. And that\u2019s very nice too, so if I go along, it\u2019s because I want to."

            "answer": "Yes, I went back at least twice to my town, Anspach, that beautiful, baroque town with the beautiful cobblestones and the [indecipherable] and the castle and the churches and everything. See how pretty it is, with stained glass windows and these gorgeous roofs all covered with that tile. And I -- I -- I -- I used to like my hometown, I w -- I was a v -- a very happy girl there, before Hitler and I used to love it. I remember so many little things. M-My grandmother once took me to the -- to the Hoffgarden, which is like a arboretum, at night when I was very little, because there was a Queen of the Night that was opening up at night and she wanted me to see that and I never forgot it. It had such an aroma to it and at -- it -- I could see the petals opening, I was just a young girl and it was dark and there were these white petals opening up and throwing their -- their perfume at me. I never forgot it. So there were many reasons why I liked my hometown a lot. But I went back and I -- I -- I was most unhappy there. I felt so -- I felt as if I had an itchy skirt -- shirt on me. As if I wanted to scratch myself all the time and get out of there. And Anspach was notoriously anti-Semitic and it was very interesting. I -- I had -- I wanted to see the synagogue, which is a -- a beautiful, historical building. It was built by the same architect that built the castle for the margraff there. At that point the Jews were in -- in good standing with the margraff and they asked for a synagogue and he -- that was in 1745 -- 300 -- 500 -- 400 years ago and he gave them his own architect and helped Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 1 them build this beautiful synagogue, here it is. See, this is the castle and the synagogue has the same high windows, that I\u2019Il show you in a minute, if I can find it. So, I was very anxious to go back and I had to ask for the key to the synagogue at the -- at the city hall, because now it\u2019s closed. There are no Jews living there, so it\u2019s just a memorial. And I went to the city hall and I asked for the -- for the key and they told me that -- I asked in -- in German, you know, I didn\u2019t want them to know who I am. And -- and I asked and they said I had to wait a few minutes, the fellow th-that -- who I had corresponded with that I was coming, Mr. Lung, will be here in a minute, he\u2019s out celebrating his birthday. And I had noticed that on the letters that he had written to me, telling me I had to come and get the key myself, he never used his first name, he always said his title, whatever it was, Raths -- something Lung and there was no first name. And so I waited a few minutes and he came back from his birthday party and I could figure out from the date that where we are now and hi -- this was his 50th birthday party, that he was born right smack in the Hitler regime. And when he came in, you know, the whole office exploded, \u201cOh, g- glerkil -- glerklishan kiportstak, Adolf.\u201d So you see, the whole city was so anti -- so pro- Hitler that they named their little kids Adolf. And that\u2019s why he never used his -- his name, he was ashamed of -- he could change it actually, he\u2019s sitting right there in city hall. It\u2019s not hard for him to change. But you know, you\u2019re -- you\u2019re fine tuned. You pick up things that other people would -- that then I would never have picked up. He didn\u2019t use his name and he was born just -- just 1933 and his parents named him Adolf in -- in -- in adoration of their fuehrer, you see? So -- so everything contributed to my being very Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection uncomfortable there. And he gave me the key and I went through the synagogue and of course as soon as I had opened up that very beautiful synagogue, other people came, pushing in and of course he didn\u2019t allow that, so he cut my visit short and you know, everything was just against me and I da -- I wa -- I wasn\u2019t happy there."

You see, we had to leave Anspach and had to move in with some relatives in a big city. My sister was already then in Frankfort, at the Jewish hospital as a nurse and I was in Berlin as a Jewish nurse. So we were all separated and in order to save postage, which was -- was a big deal in those days, we would write to my mother, to Munich and then she would include our letters into hers.

So here she writes, on N-November the ninth, on a Sunday, in 1941 -- yeah, I was wrong, was the September date, I -- I blacked out there for awhile. September was her birthday and she wrote to him at that time -- and I think it\u2019s in here, too, that she got as a birthday present what everybody else got too, September 19th of 1941 and that was the star. And whether my father caught on or not, I don\u2019t know, but she couldn\u2019t outright say that. But I -- I understood it when I reread her letter. So I got my dates wrong. On November the ninth, she was beginning to be de-deported and she says, \u201cMy dear Siegfried, it is difficult to me to wr -- for me to write to you today, because I have to give you sad news.

I know you will be upset, but I beg you, dear Siegfried, don\u2019t grieve and don\u2019t be pessimistic. I am calm and I\u2019m not excited. The children feared Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection deporta-deportation already for a long time and have been worried about me all this time. Tomorrow I must call them and talk to them. I only hope that they will be spared. I beg you, dear Siegfried, don\u2019t be upset and don\u2019t be sad and most of all, do not blame yourself. If anyone deserves to be blamed, it is I, because it was I who urged you to leave without us. We human beings are a thing of naught. I see it clearer now than ever before. All our planning, our hopes and toil comes to nothing when God decides differently. I think now, if only I had done this or that, but it\u2019s no use. It\u2019s all destined by God. Here I am, making a farewell speech, but as yet I hope that I can write to you where I\u2019m going. I haven\u2019t heard anything from mother in Redensberg or from Berta in Aidid. I hope they will be spared. I will write to you a second letter today before I must go. Lovingly, Paula.\u201d Yeah, that was the ninth of November, 1941. And she wrote that same day, another letter. \u201cMy dear Siegfried, to continue, I have a letter to send you from the children also; it\u2019s a week old. I had hoped so much that Freidel would be able to come for a few days before I would be deported, but really, I didn\u2019t believe that I would actually be called up. And now it\u2019s a reality, as I told you in the first letter. I am in the first evacuation from Munich. I don\u2019t imagine it as all too black and I\u2019m not upset and of course Ill write to you from there as soon as possible, but don\u2019t be concerned if it takes long. And I repeat, dear Siegfried, don\u2019t worry about me and don\u2019t reproach yourself. Fate 1s stronger than we are. If it\u2019s God will that we will be reunited, He can arrange that from there, just as it is His will that I could not get to you from here. I\u2019ve packed already, have taken all my warm clothes along. Frau Kaufman, the old lady who lives with me is Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection also in the transport and many of my old friends. Together our lot will be easier to pare -- bear. Now my dear Siegfried, I have just talked with the children. Freidel wants to come with me and Gerda too. I don\u2019t know if they can get travel permission and at any rate, they should stay and keep in contact with you. Farewell.\u201d On the 11th she was deported to Ausch -- to Riga.

And you know, I got only one criticism in that whole time on the first book and it was from a Polish man -- a Pole, not a Jew, who objected to my stating in the book that the Poles were the most anti-Semitic nation in -- in Europe and he pointed out to me in that letter, which of course I saved, that the Poles had done a lot for the Jews back in the olden days, which 1s correct. The kings of Pole -- Poland took the Jews in and let them prosper there and indeed they prospered in Poland. The Jewish community of Poland was outstanding. But during Hitler time, I remain with my -- with my statement that Poland was the most violently anti-Semitic country in Europe. But all the other letters, except for that one, were -- were with me -- were with me. Some were eye openers, that they didn\u2019t know what was going on. Some said, \u201cYeah, I was there too and you described it just right.\u201d Others thanked me for opening up and others complimented me for being able to do it. And that was, of course, in \u201883, after my first book came out. Now I wrote a second book and that came out in \u201893 and I wrote that for a younger audience and you know, the interesting thing 1s, I did not get the response that I got the first time. I don\u2019t know why. It may have to do with the editor\u2019s broadcasting it less, publish it -- publicizing it less. But I give the book to Bat Mitzvah and Bas Mitzvah -- and Bar Mitzvah kids and kids that I think would understand. They are 12 and 13 years old and they should know. And I gave it recently to one of my little -- little 13 year -- 12 year old friends who had a -- a -- a Bat Mitzvah. She lives actually right across the street from me and she writes me, \u201cDear Dr. and Mrs. Rudolf Haas, thank you very much for celebrating this special occasion with me. Your gift was wonderful. I finished the book with a completely different attitude toward the Holocaust. I was often afraid to read Holocaust books, because I feared they would give me nightmares. Reading the stories of all these people made me realize how many good people there were. I also need to remember that the Holocaust was a reality and it wasn\u2019t a nightmare. Thank you for everything you have done for me. Sincerely, Sophie Rappaport.\u201d And that was now -- that\u2019s a young girl, that -- the third generation after me. It still lives and they still want to know."
