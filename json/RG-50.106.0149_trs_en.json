I hate that, because we were so hungry we Interview with Tol\u00e9 Madna April 18, 2002 43even ate tulip bul-bulbs in -- in the -- in the last part of the war, because there was no other food. And they didn\u2122t taste bad. Tast e il -- they\u2122re kind of sweet, but I say s -- tell it to one of the people I met here, yeah , they were talking about growing tulips. I said, oh yeah, you grow the tulips. We ate them. But, of course the -- I told you before that in -- especially in these times, the end of April, beginning of May, the war comes back to you and the ar -- yeah, the memories. I think the war was -- yeah, a mi -- a major experience in my life. And I never want to -- to have that again in my life. If -- I was in the army myself and it was -- I had to go again in the army in \u212262 just for a -- a few weeks, and then the ticu -- Cuba crisis came, so we were very [indecipherable] but luckily it didn\u2122t -- it worked out well. But I think the experience -- you have to te ll younger people about it because I always say, when you never had a toothache, yo u don\u2122t know -- you can\u2122t talk about a toothache. And if you never experience war or hunger, you can\u2122t just -- can\u2122t talk about it. But you can tell them the story that way that they kind of feel it, you know? Because there were a lot of young people said, can\u2122t you forget that? I remember in -- though, a nice German musician was in the band I was playing in and he ca -- explained this -- the way to Germany, we had a gig in Germany, you know, in the -- understand the word gig? Because it\u2122s an kind of music -- musician expression. And he said, oh it\u2122s very close. I said, I know it was close, they were pretty soon here, you know. And Interview with Tol\u00e9 Madna April 18, 2002 44then he said, can\u2122t you forget about it? I said, not my generation. You have to wait. So."

So you have a good contact Interview with Tol\u00e9 Madna April 18, 2002 49and I -- I told him, you spoiled us so much I -- I don\u2122t think that I ever can go back to a normal life again. It\u2122s hardly possible to pay anything and no, it was really an experience and I think we are even closer now than we w-were before. Also with Joel we have a good understanding and th ey are very lovely people. So it -- I hesitated to come to Washington, and -- but I am glad I did. I didn\u2122t think that I would ever go to America again after my visit in Boston and Miami, because not too many things, and I met those -- and we met some congressmen yes-yesterday and they say hello to you and they say nice things and -- and I always had the feeling that they didn\u2122t know we we re there, you know. But we met other, nice people, real nice people that talked to us and -- and listened to us, so -- but I met the other kind of American, that is -- say, you have a nice day, but without meaning. T-Too many of them and that makes me -- well, also the things I don\u2122t agree with. Like I -- I didn\u2122t agree with Vietnam. I didn't agree with a lot of things. The -- the power and th-the -- be friendly but still that superior feeling they try to express. Also the music. We met at an -- I remember that the delegation from Miami that visited our school because we have connection with the University of Miami, the music department. They thought, well it\u2122s always nice to have connection in Holland, you know, Europe . But they thought they were much better, and it wasn\u2122t so. They were, really when they heard our students, [indecipherable] oh, how is this possible? So that Interview with Tol\u00e9 Madna April 18, 2002 50gave me some anti feelings, but I know for sure that it\u2122s the system sometimes I hate, but I met so -- so many nice people, t oo. Musicians. I met a lot of American musicians, played with a lot of American musicians, also famous guys, and they were very friendly. And when I met them sometimes seven years, they knew exactly who you were, huh? So it\u2122s people, and not a nation. But I hope everything will go well. And Israel has a difficult period now. I hope everything -- because in Holland they are changing also, little bit. It\u2122s a-a bout 50 percent a-against and 50 percent -- because we have also a lot of Moslems in Holland. But I think -- my opinion is that Israel has to fight back because they are surrounded by enemies. And I\u2122m still for Israel and maybe not for Sharon, sure for Peres. And th-they are not really united. Th-They think different. They want peace, too. And maybe there are Palestinians that want peace, too. But I don\u2122t want to go in politics. I think I have -- we have to bring the luggage down, eh?"
