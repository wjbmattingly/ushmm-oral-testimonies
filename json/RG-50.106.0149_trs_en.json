And on the other side the street, the Germans soldiers were on bicycles, heavily armed, because th-the allies said you have to take care of the situation til we come, but don\u2019t do anything. So it was very funny to see this English soldier, we were all around him, and see these German soldiers at the o-other side of street. And then it Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Tole Madna _ April 18, 2002 was over, it was over. And nobody thought about hunger any more.

            "answer": "I remember one incident, I was working in Germany for the first time in 1953, in Cologne. And I remember I ate in the intermission. And we had a -- a -- the tough job. We started nine o\u2019clock in the evening, until five o\u2019clock in the morning, for 23 marks. That wa -- wa-wasn\u2019t bad money in those days. And I remember that I woked up to see the night, because it was summer. I went in with daylight and come out with daylight. So I went up to see the night. But I remember while eating in the intermission, there were two waiters talking about Hitler. And that -- hm, I -- I think he will come back. And I got so angry, and then I said, and then we will definitely kill him. And they become so afraid, because in those days, if I would have told the English authorities about them, they would get in trouble. So they quieted down and be-be-became like slaves, they acted like slaves, you know. Didn\u2019t dare to say anything whe-when I was in the neighborhood, but I remember that made me very angry to hear that. And Cologne was bombed heavily, it was ruins. I worked in Dusseldorf, too. But I kind of like Germany. It\u2019s a beautiful country. We always make the joke, it\u2019s a pity there are so many Germans here. But you know, I -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019ve been teaching germ -- Germans since 1985 at the conservatory and a lot of them Interview with Tole Madna * April 18, 2002 became my good friends. And I know you can\u2019t blame them. But still I -- I told about my attitude in the war, and I told them about the two sisters, Eva and Leah, of Alfred and told them about Alfred and they always feel very uncomfortable th -- when you talk about it. I said, I don\u2019t blame you, I blame that system. But --"

I even told a German student of mine who was raising his voice -- not against me but to somebody else, and said, I hate it when people raise their voice, and especially when they\u2019re German.

Do you think that has made you a different person than if you hadn\u2019t experienced those times?",
            "answer": "Oh, I\u2019m sure. One thing 1s, for instance, I hate to spoil food and to take too much on the plate so that there\u2019s something left. I hate that, because we were so hungry we Interview with Tole Madna \u201c April 18, 2002 even ate tulip bul-bulbs in -- in the -- in the last part of the war, because there was no other food. And they didn\u2019t taste bad. Taste il -- they\u2019re kind of sweet, but I say s -- tell it to one of the people I met here, yeah, they were talking about growing tulips. I said, oh yeah, you grow the tulips. We ate them. But, of course the -- I told you before that in -- especially in these times, the end of April, beginning of May, the war comes back to you and the ar -- yeah, the memories. I think the war was -- yeah, a mi -- a major experience in my life. And I never want to -- to have that again in my life. If -- I was in the army myself and it was -- I had to go again in the army in \u201962 just for a -- a few weeks, and then the ticu -- Cuba crisis came, so we were very [indecipherable] but luckily it didn\u2019t -- it worked out well. But I think the experience -- you have to tell younger people about it because I always say, when you never had a toothache, you don\u2019t know -- you can\u2019t talk about a toothache. And if you never experience war or hunger, you can\u2019t just -- can\u2019t talk about it. But you can tell them the story that way that they kind of feel it, you know? Because there were a lot of young people said, can\u2019t you forget that? I remember in -- though, a nice German musician was in the band I was playing in and he ca -- explained this -- the way to Germany, we had a gig in Germany, you know, in the -- understand the word gig? Because it\u2019s an kind of music -- musician expression. And he said, oh it\u2019s very close. I said, I know it was close, they were pretty soon here, you know. And Interview with Tole Madna \u201c April 18, 2002 then he said, can\u2019t you forget about it? I said, not my generation. You have to wait. So."

It\u2019s hardly possible to pay anything and no, it was really an experience and I think we are even closer now than we w-were before.

But we met other, nice people, real nice people that talked to us and -- and listened to us, so -- but I met the other kind of American, that is -- say, you have a nice day, but without meaning. T-Too many of them and that makes me -- well, also the things I don\u2019t agree with. Like I -- I didn\u2019t agree with Vietnam. [| didn't agree with a lot of things. The -- the power and th-the -- be friendly but still that superior feeling they try to express. Also the music. We met at an -- I remember that the delegation from Miami that visited our school because we have connection with the University of Miami, the music department. They thought, well it\u2019s always nice to have connection in Holland, you know, Europe. But they thought they were much better, and it wasn\u2019t so. They were, really when they heard our students, [indecipherable] oh, how is this possible? So that Interview with Tole Madna ~ April 18, 2002 gave me some anti feelings, but I know for sure that it\u2019s the system sometimes I hate, but I met so -- so many nice people, too. Musicians. I met a lot of American musicians, played with a lot of American musicians, also famous guys, and they were very friendly. And when I met them sometimes seven years, they knew exactly who you were, huh? So it\u2019s people, and not a nation. But I hope everything will go well. And Israel has a difficult period now. I hope everything -- because in Holland they are changing also, little bit. It\u2019s a-about 50 percent a-against and 50 percent -- because we have also a lot of Moslems in Holland. But I think -- my opinion is that Israel has to fight back because they are surrounded by enemies. And I\u2019m still for Israel and maybe not for Sharon, sure for Peres. And th-they are not really united. Th-They think different. They want peace, too. And maybe there are Palestinians that want peace, too. But I don\u2019t want to go in politics. I think I have -- we have to bring the luggage down, eh?"
