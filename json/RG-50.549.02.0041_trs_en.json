The Red Cross wanted to take me to a hospital and I insisted, I said, \ufb01No, I am dying, I want to go home.\ufb02 So I -- An old taxi cab, converted into somewhat of an ambulance took me home and I told the driver, \ufb01Go and ask for my father. Don\u2122t shock my mother, because I haven\u2122t seen her for some time.\ufb02 And -- So, later on, I heard he went up, asked for my father, wasn\u2122t there, then he told my mother that he had something for her, and my mother thought that it was a suitcase that my father had sent from France. And he had finally said, \ufb01Look, why don\u2122t you go with me?\ufb02 So I -- my mother walked down. It was snowing, and she looked into the car and she was a little confused because she didn\u2122t recognize me. And so then I told her, \ufb01Mother,\ufb02 and finally, after she looked three tim es, says, \ufb01Walter?\ufb02 And that is when she called a neighbor to have to carry me in, and I remember the neighbor touched my legs and they were inflamed and extremely painful. So, eventually, they got me in and someone in the train had given me an apple, that caused me to have a little diarrhea, so I asked them to take me to the bathroom. And shortly ther eafter, the bell rang, it was my father and my mother yelled, \ufb01Paul, Walter is here.\ufb02 So he came and he saw me and then he just couldn\u2122t control himself and cr ied for a long time.

And one of them knew me because I was a star swimmer, and they told my father, \ufb01Nevermind, we\u2122re going to say that -- that he was not here.\ufb02 So they left and then we accommodate -- accommodate ourself in the basement. Maybe a day, maybe two, maybe three days later, my father, upon my mother\u2122s suggestion, tried to find a doctor who assured my parents that there was no hope. So a priest was called, who gave me the last sacraments, and -- but obviously I didn\u2122t die. And then when the Americans marched in, I think it was April the 12th, my father went to see the commanding o fficer, told him about me and they came with the military ambulance, and took me to a German hospital which was occupied by an American medica -- medical company, and I was with them, ooh, for quite some time."

I was a German and that was enough for him, he being Jewish. After that -- No, I think -- Well, of course, when I traveled in France, at that time it was near impossible to tell somebody, I am German, they would have liquidated you. So I traveled through Fran ce as a Frenchman. I have participated in conversations like, these Goddamn Germans, these horrible, these this and this and so on and so forth. So, except -- until when I came to South America, which is about as proGerman as you can get, in any part of South America, and quite anti-Semitic.

And one day the American doctor told me that my USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041 6 heart would not support so much gain of weight and that I had to get up and I thought that was a bad joke.

            "answer": "Situation in Germany was rather unbearable, Black Market, one German would denounce another German for being a member of the Nazi party, for having done this or that. The entire country was destroyed, D\u00fcssel dorf 75 percent. There didn\u2122t seem to be a future. Money did not exist, it was bartering. Coffee, cigarettes, butter were the main items for bartering. My parents had lost my brother, who had fallen to his death in the Alps. My mother continuously cried. So it was a period of depression and even though at USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041 7 that time it was an impossibility to leave, you couldn\u2122t leave -- you couldn\u2122t go in the street after 10 o\u2122clock. But somehow I flirte d with the idea of going to America. And anybody with whom I would have shared the id ea would have declared me insane. I went to see a teacher of mine, an old teacher who -- I understand that he had an estate, or his family had an estate in Amer ica. And I didn\u2122t know that much about the difference of South America and North America, to me America was America. I went to see him, and I remember he asked me, \ufb01Whe re do you want to go, eventually?\ufb02 \ufb01Well,\ufb02 I said, \ufb01America.\ufb02 \ufb01What part of America?\ufb02 And I said North America just to give him an answer. He said, \ufb01Well, I\u2122m very sorry, but my family has an estate in -- close to Buenos Aires, in Argentina.\ufb02 Then I went to see my father, and I told him that -- that I was going to try to leave. Said, \ufb01You know that\u2122s impossible.\ufb02 Well, I said, \ufb01I\u2122m going to try.\ufb02 And he said that, \ufb01If I didn\u2122t know you, I would say you are crazy, but -- but there\u2122s no need for me to say anything. All I say that whatever person you meet, just expect them to be no good and if they are good, you\u2122re going to ha ve a very pleasant surprise.\ufb02 That was his advice. I had previously tried -- well, let me explain that many Germans in large cities, knowing that the cities were to be or were being bombed, took certain items of value and shipped them to relatives in rural areas, which happened to be the Russian zone. My parents had shipped a suitcase to some friends . And going to the Russian zone was quite an adventure and I went to the Russian zone se veral times. And that itself is quite a story."

And I wondered whether he could help me, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041 9 whether there was a train going across. He told me about a cargo train and well, I hid in that cargo train and went to Belgium. I went to see an old farmer. Matter of fact, I visited the farmer\u2122s son last year.

So, I took him under my arm and took him to his ship, whic h was the Silver Ocean, a Swedish ship, and oh, it must have been three in the morning, and when I woke up, we were on the ocean. He looked at me and said, \ufb01Who are you?\ufb02 And I told him, he said, \ufb01Well, if you helped me to come aboard the ship, I ought to help you.\ufb02 And he gave me a seaman\u2122s book, which is kind of an ID card fo r sailors, and with a seaman\u2122s book, you can actually work on almost any ship that needs help, but I lost the seaman\u2122s book eventually.

I had someone who helped me. The way it goes when you stow aw ay from a European port, you try to stay USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041 12 hidden for at least two days, until you\u2122re far away from the British Isle, because if not, speed boats will pick you up and bring you back.

The beds generally have curtai ns so the light doesn\u2122t bother you so much and he drew the curtains and he saw me there. And they convinced him not to report me to the captain. By they, I mean the few guys who knew about me.

Well there is a -- there\u2122s a small ladder going down if you have to repair the propeller, and there\u2122s some old, big ropes lying there. And I was there, well, I guess a day and a night.

So I says Slavan inga, he says, \ufb01You\u2122re not French.\ufb02 And so I told him that actually I was from Alsace-Lorraine and I also spoke German, and he kind of accepted that and he told me what to do and I became a coal trimmer. A coal trimmer is one that shovels coal and shoves it to the firemen, who in turn put the coal into the fire. So I worked together with a -- with a black guy from Curaao, his name was Lovey. And I had a shift from four to eight in the morning and four to eight in the evening. I began to do drawings, co pies of photographs and I became rather popular on the ship and the captain called me one day and told me that we were going to first go to Vit\u00f3ria in Brazil and that he asked me to be quiet, that he would not turn me over to the authorities. I had told him that I had an uncle in Utawai who was waiting for me, and that came because I had met some guys on an Argentine ship. One of them had told me that his family lived in Montevideo, that I was welcome. Then he gave me an address in Montevideo. The other one gave me an address in Buenos Aires where I could stay.

So in Vegas, they said goodbye to me, but they gave me a few dollars and said, \ufb01Why don\u2122t you take the Greyhound bus?\ufb02 I took the Greyhound bus, and arrived in Los Angeles and checked into the hotel across the Greyhound station.

Shortly before that time, I have to explain; Peruvian parents, parents of polio children used to go to Warm Springs, Georgia with their children. But eventually, they thought, why not bring a doctor down here? We give him a car and a chauffeur, it\u2122s cheaper and we don\u2122t lose that much time.

And he invited me to come to Warm Springs, Georgia. I thought, I get a diploma that I can hang on the wall and -- and then I know what I\u2122m doing, and take it from there. So, I was aske d to establish contact with horse loving people and I made the same mistake that everybody else makes, and that is everybody believes that Texas is the horsey-est state in the nation.
