            "question": "Okay. And going back just a little bit, when the Red Cross took you to your mother -- to your home, is that right? Do you remember any particular impact that the Red Cross had on your rescue? A lot of people have memories about the Red Cross and their work.",
            "answer": "Well, it was not actually the Red Cross. The Red Cross wanted to take me to a hospital and I insisted, I said, \u201cNo, I am dying, I want to go home.\u201d So I -- An old taxi cab, converted into somewhat of an ambulance took me home and I told the driver, \u201c\u201cGo and ask for my father. Don\u2019t shock my mother, because I haven\u2019t seen her for some time.\u201d And -- So, later on, I heard he went up, asked for my father, wasn\u2019t there, then he told my mother that he had something for her, and my mother thought that it was a suitcase that my father had sent from France. And he had finally said, \u201cLook, why don\u2019t you go with me?\u201d So I -- my mother walked down. It was snowing, and she looked into the car and she was a little confused because she didn\u2019t recognize me. And so then I told her, \u201cMother,\u201d and finally, after she looked three times, says, \u201cWalter?\u201d And that is when she called a neighbor to have to carry me in, and I remember the neighbor touched my legs and they were inflamed and extremely painful. So, eventually, they got me in and someone in the train had given me an apple, that caused me to have a little diarrhea, so I asked them to take me to the bathroom. And shortly thereafter, the bell rang, 1t was my father and my mother yelled, \u201cPaul, Walter is here.\u201d So he came and he saw me and then he just couldn\u2019t control himself and cried for a long time. Then they sh --"

            "answer": "No. Maybe three days later, two policemen came looking for me, and my father said, \u201cYes, he is here.\u201d And he brought them in and he uncovered me, said, \u201cDo you want to take him like that?\u201d And I think I weighed about 78 pounds. And one of them knew me because I was a star swimmer, and they told my father, \u201cNevermind, we\u2019re going to say that -- that he was not here.\u201d So they left and then we accommodate -- accommodate ourself in the basement. Maybe a day, maybe two, maybe three days later, my father, upon my mother\u2019s suggestion, tried to find a doctor who assured my parents that there was no hope. So a priest was called, who gave me the last sacraments, and -- but obviously I didn\u2019t die. And then when the Americans marched in, I think it was April the 12\", my father went to see the commanding officer, told him about me and they came with the military ambulance, and took me to a German hospital which was occupied by an American medica -- medical company, and I was with them, ooh, for quite some time."

            "answer": "Oh well, once with Major Hermann. We didn\u2019t -- It didn\u2019t mean enough to him that I had suffered and that I was not, in quote, a Nazi. I was a German and that was enough for him, he being Jewish. After that -- No, I think -- Well, of course, when I traveled in France, at that time it was near impossible to tell somebody, I am German, they would have liquidated you. So I traveled through France as a Frenchman. I have participated in conversations like, these Goddamn Germans, these horrible, these this and this and so on and so forth. So, except -- until when I came to South America, which is about as pro- German as you can get, in any part of South America, and quite anti-Semitic. So as a German, no, except for the -- the -- the time immediately after the war in other European countries, where I didn\u2019t dare say that I was German, other than that no, I had -- there were no repercussions because of my heritage, no."

            "answer": "Yeah, my parents came from time to time and I remember that I gained, oh sometimes as much as a pound and a half a day. And one day the American doctor told me that my heart would not support so much gain of weight and that I had to get up and I thought that was a bad joke. But I remember h-he telling me that I had to jump on one leg 13 times and then on the other one, where little by little, I went -- some GIs drove me around in a wheelchair and I would do sketches of the GIs. And then, maybe it was two or three months later, I walked with this cane and I was released and I was then with my parents. And Americans, shortly thereafter, were replaced by the British."

            "answer": "No, not in the hospital, as occupation troop. The -- The -- si -- The American military zone -- part of the American military zone became British. They -- They re-divided geographic areas, where the Americans stayed in Frankfurt, Heidelberg and so on and the British used another part of Germany and of course the Russians took all of East Germany."

            "num": 16,
            "question": "You had quite a -- a rich life since, which is why I wanted to start here, and I also had a question, although I understand that you were a person who loved adventure, I wondered how long you stayed at home, and why did you go?",
            "answer": "Situation in Germany was rather unbearable, Black Market, one German would denounce another German for being a member of the Nazi party, for having done this or that. The entire country was destroyed, Dusseldorf 75 percent. There didn\u2019t seem to be a future. Money did not exist, it was bartering. Coffee, cigarettes, butter were the main items for bartering. My parents had lost my brother, who had fallen to his death in the Alps. My mother continuously cried. So it was a period of depression and even though at that time it was an impossibility to leave, you couldn\u2019t leave -- you couldn\u2019t go in the street after 10 o\u2019clock. But somehow I flirted with the idea of going to America. And anybody with whom I would have shared the idea would have declared me insane. I went to see a teacher of mine, an old teacher who -- I understand that he had an estate, or his family had an estate in America. And I didn\u2019t know that much about the difference of South America and North America, to me America was America. I went to see him, and I remember he asked me, \u201cWhere do you want to go, eventually?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cAmerica.\u201d \u201cWhat part of America?\u201d And I said North America just to give him an answer. He said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m very sorry, but my family has an estate 1n -- close to Buenos Aires, in Argentina.\u201d Then I went to see my father, and I told him that -- that I was going to try to leave. Said, \u201cYou know that\u2019s impossible.\u201d Well, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to try.\u201d And he said that, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know you, I would say you are crazy, but -- but there\u2019s no need for me to say anything. All I say that whatever person you meet, just expect them to be no good and if they are good, you\u2019re going to have a very pleasant surprise.\u201d That was his advice. I had previously tried -- well, let me explain that many Germans in large cities, knowing that the cities were to be or were being bombed, took certain items of value and shipped them to relatives in rural areas, which happened to be the Russian zone. My parents had shipped a suitcase to some friends. And going to the Russian zone was quite an adventure and I went to the Russian zone several times. And that itself is quite a story."

So I stow away to Achen, which 1s right on the border, and there I -- I had some cigarettes with me that I gave to a railroad employee, and I asked him -- I spoke to him with a French accent and I told him that I had been in Germany as a French prisoner of war and that I\u2019d fallen in love with a German girl and I\u2019d come to see her and I needed to go back. And I wondered whether he could help me, whether there was a train going across. He told me about a cargo train and well, I hid in that cargo train and went to Belgium. I went to see an old farmer. Matter of fact, I visited the farmer\u2019s son last year. And he told me, \u201cDon\u2019t come up, they\u2019re looking for Germans all over the place, so --"

Hitler took it back, and after Hitler lost, they returned to Belgium. So those areas, like Alsace-Lorraine, they all speak German and they\u2019re probably more German than Belgian, or Germ -- [indecipherable] so anyway, he gave me some sandwich, an apple, and told me that I should wait for the milk truck. It took me to Liege. Well, at -- at noon time, I was in -- in Brussels and I stayed a few days in Brussels, visiting with a friend of my father. Then I went to France and eventually I became a sailor. That went on until December of \u201948, when I stow awayed on a -- on a Dutch freighter and went to South America."

And in port cities, there\u2019s always danger of being attacked. So, I took him under my arm and took him to his ship, which was the Silver Ocean, a Swedish ship, and oh, it must have been three in the morning, and when I woke up, we were on the ocean. He looked at me and said, \u201cWho are you?\u201d And I told him, he said, \u201cWell, if you helped me to come aboard the ship, I ought to help you.\u201d And he gave me a seaman\u2019s book, which is kind of an ID card for sailors, and with a seaman\u2019s book, you can actually work on almost any ship that needs help, but I lost the seaman\u2019s book eventually. Anyway, with him I went to Casablanca. I went back to continental Europe and I was trying to stow away on an Argentine ship, but the captain kind of smelled --"

La Rochelle to Lavre, and I went eventually -- went to Rotterdam, Amsterdam and eventually I came back to Anverb and I received at the post office, letter from my father, who said that, \u201cDear Walter, there -- you will not be able to leave Europe for America. Your mother has baked special cookies for Christmas and I ask you to come home and be with us for Christmas.\u201d And I wrote back, \u201cIf I don\u2019t get a ship until next week, Pll be home.\u201d And that\u2019s what I would have done, but on December the 16\"\", I was on the Parkhaven and stow awayed on the Parkhaven. I had someone who helped me. The way it goes when you stow away from a European port, you try to stay Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection hidden for at least two days, until you\u2019re far away from the British Isle, because if not, speed boats will pick you up and bring you back.

She still hoped that I would be back soon. And so, on this ship, I think the second day, the chief steward came and discovered me. The beds generally have curtains so the light doesn\u2019t bother you so much and he drew the curtains and he saw me there. And they convinced him not to report me to the captain. By they, I mean the few guys who knew about me. And so he said, \u201cWell, can\u2019t leave him here, you have to find another hiding place.\u201d So they put me to the most horrible place of all places, and that 1s where the propeller of the ship is. Well there 1s a -- there\u2019s a small ladder going down if you have to repair the propeller, and there\u2019s some old, big ropes lying there. And I was there, well, I guess a day and a night. And boy, you could always feel the water comes almost to your feet and then goes back down and it\u2019s solid black. I mean, a -- a -- a dungeon is nothing in comparison."

So I says Slavaninga, he says, \u201cYou\u2019re not French.\u201d And so I told him that actually I was from Alsace-Lorraine and I also spoke German, and he kind of accepted that and he told me what to do and I became a coal trimmer. A coal trimmer is one that shovels coal and shoves it to the firemen, who in turn put the coal into the fire. So I worked together with a -- with a black guy from Curacao, his name was Lovey. And I had a shift from four to eight in the morning and four to eight in the evening. I began to do drawings, copies of photographs and I became rather popular on the ship and the captain called me one day and told me that we were going to first go to Vitoria in Brazil and that he asked me to be quiet, that he would not turn me over to the authorities.

So they\u2019re very much desired and in demand and some of them become outstanding citizens, some of them enter politics, some of them become statesmen. So, as a whole, German immigration, even in Texas here, I mean, people go out of their way to say, \u201cOh, my grand-grandfather was German.\u201d It doesn\u2019t make a damn bit of difference to me, but they show you that -- they will not go out of their way to say that their great-grandfather was Polish, but if he was German, they will let you know.

And I finally became furious and I said, \u201cYou know, I dreamed of this country many, many times. Of the liberal way, of democracy. When I came to this country, nobody ever stopped me and told me that if you hit a deer, you have to report. There\u2019s no sign or anything for that. So, if you want to put me in jail, fine.\u201d There was a captain or lieutenant, so he said, \u201cLet him go.\u201d So I was on my way again, came to Salt Lake City, delivered the car and they looked at the fender.

So I -- \u201cCan I rent your room for a day or two?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d And I slept, I slept beautifully and the next day I went to restaurant.

I talked to them, they said, \u201cWell, how about you pay your way and you do the driving?\u201d I said, \u201cFine.\u201d We drove from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas. At some service station, the soldier boys had flirted with two ladies, I think it was mother and daughter and had invited them to have a good time in Vegas. So in Vegas, they said goodbye to me, but they gave me a few dollars and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take the Greyhound bus?\u201d I took the Greyhound bus, and arrived in Los Angeles and checked into the hotel across the Greyhound station. And from there I tried to reach John Carroll, no luck, until finally the operator told me, \u201cNo more telephone calls, you have to make a deposit first.\u201d I left a suitcase, took bus and went up to the San Fernando Valley and eventually, oh, the first person I met was John Derek, who died not too long ago, Bo Derek\u2019s husband, with whom I rode horses later on.

And many people in Peru believed, like people all over the world, I assume, that polio was contagious. And parents of polio affected children knew that water was very good, called hydrotherapy, or water therapy, and they wanted me to take care of their children. But the others, when they heard that I was going to deal with polio children, they kind of shied away, being afraid that 1t would be contagious. So, I kind of concentrated with them during lunchtime. From 12 to two, I had nothing but polio affected children. I became extremely successful, economically and in every way and I then dreamed of having -- well, I have to explain, when you go from Lima east, for about -- less than an hour, and you come to an area where the sun shines, while right in Lima, a situation is a little bit like Los Angeles, the mountains push the clouds back, so you have this dampness over Lima. It never rains, but you don\u2019t see much of a blue sky, but you go a little inwards, the sky is blue, the sun shines and wealthy people begin to have beautiful homes there. And in that area, I wanted to build the most elegant swimming school, where people could have a cup of coffee and watch through one-sided glass, see their children and -- and so on. Well, I had a child in my school, that learned to take the first steps. Her father was president and owner of one of the largest bank houses.

So I said, \u201cWell, at least I would like to have the land and maybe then you can help me to finance the rest, any time.\u201d Well, that was a project that I was very much involved with, and a friend of mine, a Swiss architect, helped me to design something which was partly underground. Well, at that time, somebody had inquired about the Peruvian passel horse, which is a very special breed of horses and -- and I was involved a little, I had a few horses myself and I loved them because they\u2019re very elegant, they have a beautiful gait. And the horse association\u2019s secretary called me and they didn\u2019t quite know how to handle this request from the United States and so I kind of took over and eventually the idea developed to take 12 stallions to the United States. Shortly before that time, I have to explain; Peruvian parents, parents of polio children used to go to Warm Springs, Georgia with their children. But eventually, they thought, why not bring a doctor down here? We give him a car and a chauffeur, it\u2019s cheaper and we don\u2019t lose that much time. So, a doctor came from Georgia and I was introduced to him and he was rather complimentary as to the fine work I had done, and I told him that everything I did was based upon common sense, but I had no schooling in water therapy, but I would like very much to pursue some kind of course. And he invited me to come to Warm Springs, Georgia. I thought, I get a diploma that I can hang on the wall and -- and then I know what I\u2019m doing, and take it from there. So, I was asked to establish contact with horse loving people and I made the same mistake that everybody else makes, and that 1s everybody believes that Texas is the horsey-est state in the nation. It\u2019s not, California is, by far. So I wrote to Texas and oh, I ended up with the Good Neighbor commission, the governor and eventually, I don\u2019t remember how, but I ended up with the San Antonio Chamber of Commerce, and I was told that we would escort the governor with our horses, during the Battle of Flowers parade, which is Texas Independence Day."

One of the horses had gone with the hoofs, had stood up with the hoofs, broke the window of the plane. I mean, it was a disaster, but we -- we made it in Houston. We were not able to unload the horses. They went from the plane on a truck and they dusted us and the horses and the quarantine officers were there. It was the biggest mess.

We were not prepared to pay. We -- We prepared to cash.

So I took over, drove to San Antonio, and while he was asleep -- oh, Jack Sellars was there waiting for us and I realized he -- he realized that he had made a mistake, we didn\u2019t have Lipisotter horses, and Jack Sellars kind of disappeared. We were at the coliseum in San Antonio with 12 horse, I said, \u201cUnload the horses, before he wakes up.\u201d And I told him, \u201cGo back and don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll pay sooner or later.\u201d Well, the press came and there I was with 12 stallion and two helpers, so the president of Lone Star Brewing Company, Harry Jerzek, bought three horses, for way below our costs. People always take advantage. That was enough money to send the guys home and I was alone with nine horses. And horses eat more than people do. So that\u2019s the way it started. Harry Jerzek was a very important figure and he introduced me to people here and there and he organized a race, an endurance race from San Antonio [indecipherable] 34 miles on the Fourth of July, 1958. And I had coached a cowboy to go with me, and we rode each a Peruvian horse and we won. And we were to cash 500 dollars, but then we were told, \u201cNo, no, no, no, no. The 500 dollars would have been to anybody who would beat you. Nobody beat you, so there\u2019s no money.\u201d I didn\u2019t understand that too well, but anyway. Then, as we arrived, I tied one horse up and the little lady felt sorry for the horse, because the horse was totally exhausted and I gave him water, which was the worst thing to do. Th-The horse died the next day. So I lost one horse. Well, there I was now with eight horses.

I said, \u201cWell, wait a minute, I\u2019m not Jewish.\u201d \u201cWell, do you mind?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit one way or the other.\u201d But they have me as a Jew there. The m -- The -- The -- The -- The name Meyer, could very easily be Jewish, very easily. It\u2019s an old, Roman name, I mean, it\u2019s a Hebrew name to start with, like Golda Meir, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s called the enlightened one. We talk more about humanity, education and even though Jews do not allow you to make comparison between persecution, systematic killing of Indians in the United States, depression and persecution and killing of Blacks, the history of the British in the world, the history of the French in the world, the history -- I mean, there\u2019s hardly a country in the world that can say we have never done anything wrong. So, the Germans were the only ones who did mass extermination in such a scientific way and it depends a little upon how you want to look at things. Is this -- Is this indicative of the German scientific mind, or is this the ultimate degree of cruelty? I mean, there are many ways of -- of looking at things. Are Germans by nature more cruel than others? No, hell no. I think French are much more sadistic than Germans are, as a whole. I look at the history of the Jews, ha -- how they have been prosecuted. I look at the church, having done nothing whatsoever to help alleviate things. So, I am more a member of the party that accuses the world, rather than pointing the fingers at one or the other. And I\u2019m pretty sure that I\u2019'd find as many sadistic Israelis as I find any -- anywhere in the world. I don\u2019t believe that I\u2019d want to be associated with a typical Marine Sargent."

That was -- And I tried to correct him, said, \u201cSS were not all killers. Some SS were volunteers. Some were recruited into the SS. They had no choice. But not every SS member killed Jews, or killed anybody. So I don\u2019t know whether those in the cemetery were killers or were totally innocent bystanders.\u201d And I encouraged. I wrote him, he never wrote back. I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go with Mr. Reagan and hold your hand and start something new? Start a peace movement.

People prepare themselve and say, \u201cIf I do this, if I get caught, oh my God, what am I going to do?\u201d I let things happen and then I think, \u201cWhat am I going to do now?\u201d So, I don\u2019t know whether optimist 1s -- 1s -- 1s an accurate word to describe me. I think I am rather -- I would rather use the word irresponsible, because in my past, I have been too -- playing with fire too much, and that is an irresponsible act. Oh, I\u2019m going to get away with it, ah, nobody\u2019s going to catch me, or nobody\u2019s going to see me and I have no fear.

You actually mention now that, or that in \u201996 interview, that you are exactly like your father. What do you mean by this?

If he had a been somewhat of a psychologist, he would have said, with a little sugar and a little candy, Walter is going to be a fantastic human being. But he beat me up until I was blue and red, a-and at the age of 12, if you had given me a gun, I would have shot him. When he saw me after the war, from then on he tried so hard to undo and redo and he was the most unselfish man I ever met. And he tried to give me his right arm and his left arm, until one day I told him, \u201cYou cannot buy my love. Just forget all the bullshit. I -- I -- Let me try to forget.\u201d And I came to love him, and I miss him. I wish he would show up some bi -- weekend. Death is a kind of miserable thing, anyway. So, when I say I am very much the way he was in many ways, I\u2019m a rather unselfish person. I never buy things for me. It\u2019s my wife who buys a new shirt or something, I don\u2019t go. I don\u2019t particularly care how I look. I don\u2019t particularly care what I eat. I don\u2019t need any luxury whatsoever. I don\u2019t need a new car, as long as the one I have runs.
