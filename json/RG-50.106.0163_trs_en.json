We lived across the street from the Temple, and there was no separation of church and state, and so when I went to school -- excuse me -- we had religion in the school. And the Catholic kids went on one floor and the Protestant kids went on another and the Jewish kids went upstairs. And I remember I had a teacher and her name was Mrs. Wolfe and she always told us we shouldn\u2122t be afraid of her because her name was Wolfe. ",

            "question": "-- to Vienna. And can you maybe talk a little bit about the previous trip that you just took this fall, this past fall with your family?",
            "answer": "Well, we went back to my husban d\u2122s hometown, which originally was in Germany, but after the second World War was given to Poland , and the name, in German it\u2122s Gleiwitz and it was changed to Gliwice in Poland , and it was under the Russian influence. And through the Holocaust Museum, th is forum found out about the fact that Frank was born in this town and cont acted us, and they erected a memorial to the Jews that had lived in this town. And it was a very, very moving Interview with Marianne Liebermann January 9, 2004 57experience for us. We also went to Berlin and I really wanted to be very unhappy in Berlin and I really wasn\u2122t, because I could u nderstand everything, and we stayed at the Hilton, which is like staying in America i-in -- in a -- another country. And two of my children had been to Germany 20 years ago when the wall was up, and they could not believe the change in East Germany. It -- it was just mind boggling to them. And Berlin is such a modern city and so many new buildings and a lot of hustle and bustle. And in Frank\u2122s hometown also, there\u2122d been a big change over the eight years. As I said, it had been u nder Russian influence, and now it seems to be, you know, a -- a -- a great place to live now. The people that live there were all forced to leave where they lived in the Ukraine and settle in this town. And they\u2122ve made the best of it, and unfortunately th ere\u2122s a lot of pollution there. There had been a coal mine there, which it was closed, but there\u2122d also been industry and all the waste had been dumped into the river. A nd so there is a great deal of pollution, and also they still use coal to heat their homes. So at night there\u2122s like a smog, it makes your eyes itch. And my son, being a doctor, wanted to fi nd out the statistics about lung cancer there, but we -- you know, we -- we weren\u2122t able to -- to find that out. And also, Frank wanted to s-show our children the apartment where we lived because the house is still standing. They changed the name of the street and the house number, but the pe ople at the forum, Andre, said that the people were afraid Interview with Marianne Liebermann January 9, 2004 58to show Frank the apartment because a lot of the Germans who had lived there are now trying to reclaim those apartments. An d so the people somehow connected that with us. So we couldn\u2122t see the apartmen t, but we saw the outside of the building and Frank showed us where he learned how to ride his bicycle and where he went to school, and so on. And the memorial that they erected was a beautiful -- they had commissioned a Polish sculptor to ma ke this memorial. It\u2122s a broken Torah wi -- and with an eternal flame in it, and they weren't able -- the synagogue had been destroyed on Kristallnacht and so the land where the synagogue was was transferred to a Jewish group, but the group is about a hundred miles away from there, and they\u2122re in dire straights and they were in the process of selling the land. So they had to get the permission from the building next door and that\u2122s a cooperative building and they did get the pe rmission of all the people who lived in that building and so the memori al is attached to that -- the wall of that building. And my son-in-law -- one of my son-in-laws passed by there after they had the ceremony, and there was a mother and a little girl. And I don\u2122t know whether they\u2122re speaking German or -- somehow he understood what they said. And I don\u2122t know what the mother said to the little girl, but the little girl said, what\u2122s a synagogue? Which sort of ga ve us the chills, you know?"
