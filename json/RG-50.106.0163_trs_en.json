It was just a very different time. And my mother always did say, cause sh -- I think she wanted to paint it as black as possible, that we were going to live ina basement. And I was such a naive kid that when we got here and we didn\u2019t live in a basement, I said, how come we\u2019re not living in a basement?

Because, let\u2019s face it, who -- who -- it\u2019s not so easy to be responsible for three people. I mean, they never had to help us monetarily, but still.

And my mother and my Interview with Marianne Liebermann * January 9, 2004 dad, too, but more my mother, remained friends with the Simons all the years until they died, the Simons died. And as I said, she was able to bring over a lot of her possessions, you know, crystals and figurines and so on, and I think -- you know, like for Christmas she would send them something like that, or she would bake them a cake, or you know, I mean they -- they really kept in touch. And this Mrs. Simon, Helen Simon was such a wonderful person that when my daughter Joan was born, she sent her a silver spoon for her birthday and for Christmas every year until she had a dozen.

            "answer": "Well, we went back to my husband\u2019s hometown, which originally was in Germany, but after the second World War was given to Poland, and the name, in German it\u2019s Gleiwitz and it was changed to Gliwice in Poland, and it was under the Russian influence. And through the Holocaust Museum, this forum found out about the fact that Frank was born in this town and contacted us, and they erected a memorial to the Jews that had lived in this town. And it was a very, very moving Interview with Marianne Liebermann >\u201d January 9, 2004 experience for us. We also went to Berlin and I really wanted to be very unhappy in Berlin and I really wasn\u2019t, because I could understand everything, and we stayed at the Hilton, which is like staying in America 1-in -- in a -- another country. And two of my children had been to Germany 20 years ago when the wall was up, and they could not believe the change in East Germany. It -- it was just mind boggling to them. And Berlin is such a modern city and so many new buildings and a lot of hustle and bustle. And in Frank\u2019s hometown also, there\u2019d been a big change over the eight years. As I said, 1t had been under Russian influence, and now it seems to be, you know, a -- a -- a great place to live now. The people that live there were all forced to leave where they lived in the Ukraine and settle in this town. And they\u2019ve made the best of it, and unfortunately there\u2019s a lot of pollution there. There had been a coal mine there, which it was closed, but there\u2019d also been industry and all the waste had been dumped into the river. And so there is a great deal of pollution, and also they still use coal to heat their homes. So at night there\u2019s like a smog, it makes your eyes itch. And my son, being a doctor, wanted to find out the statistics about lung cancer there, but we -- you know, we -- we weren\u2019t able to -- to find that out. And also, Frank wanted to s-show our children the apartment where we lived because the house is still standing. They changed the name of the street and the house number, but the people at the forum, Andre, said that the people were afraid Interview with Marianne Liebermann January 9, 2004 to show Frank the apartment because a lot of the Germans who had lived there are now trying to reclaim those apartments. And so the people somehow connected that with us. So we couldn\u2019t see the apartment, but we saw the outside of the building and Frank showed us where he learned how to ride his bicycle and where he went to school, and so on. And the memorial that they erected was a beautiful -- they had commissioned a Polish sculptor to make this memorial. It\u2019s a broken Torah wi -- and with an eternal flame in it, and they weren't able -- the synagogue had been destroyed on Kristallnacht and so the land where the synagogue was was transferred to a Jewish group, but the group is about a hundred miles away from there, and they\u2019re in dire straights and they were in the process of selling the land. So they had to get the permission from the building next door and that\u2019s a cooperative building and they did get the permission of all the people who lived in that building and so the memorial is attached to that -- the wall of that building. And my son-in-law -- one of my son-in-laws passed by there after they had the ceremony, and there was a mother and a little girl. And I don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re speaking German or -- somehow he understood what they said. And I don\u2019t know what the mother said to the little girl, but the little girl said, what\u2019s a synagogue? Which sort of gave us the chills, you know?"
