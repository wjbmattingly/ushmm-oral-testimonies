I am actually the first person who ever went to, above fourth grade or something. I have never known my grandparents, except my maternal grandmother. My paternal grandmother was killed during World War I. And my paternal grandparents both died from an epidemic of cholera. So my father and his four siblings were raised by a grandfather. Even a grandmother was not available. She died too from cholera. So in this situation my parents didn\u2019t go to school except to learn how to read and write and when they were able, I think at age ten or 11, 12 maximum, they had to learn some kind of a profession in order to be able to exist. So my father learned to be a tailor and my mother learned to be a seamstress. They were very wonderful people. My mother was full of pep and optimistic. My father was very intelligent and he sat with an encyclopedia in every single day just to learn and very interested in politics of course."

So of course they -- he was taken away with the intention to use him to make suits for the upper echelon of the military. And he was taken away to a certain military camp which was far away from us.

It\u2019s called Bistrita and across from the stables where somebody who had a business of, kept the horses. This is where the house was. The house you went down into the house, not up into the house. Had two rooms. One room where you cooked, you slept, you sat, you did everything and the other room was for guests. I never knew why, why we never used that. There was never any guests but that\u2019s my grandmother. She was beautiful. I remember the melihki [ph] dishes on the wall like this, on a little shelf. There was no running water and no bathroom. There was a like an outhouse of some sort. I remember being me being maybe three and a half or four and going with a pail. I would say three, four hundred feet where the water spout was. But I didn\u2019t know any better. I was happy that our neighbors loved me or I used to go to a friend that https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Malvy Solomon 6 May 2, 2013 had eight, nine siblings. And play with them and come home full of lice. And, but I was happy. My mother was working every single day. And she \u2014"

            "answer": "As a seamstress. She went to people\u2019s houses for the day to either make dresses or repairs or whatever. And she made sure that we have -- food was impossible to obtain. There was no food, but she somehow she was able to bring the bread or the cornmeal that was the main sustenance, main meal I would say and I wouldn\u2019t eat it of course. I was a very skinny child. And I remember like yesterday. I mean there are some things that\u2019s so imprinted that my mother went to work for the day for a lady who had a toy store. So at the end of the day the lady asked what would you like, money or something from the store? So she said I want the nicest doll that you have. So there she comes home with a doll in one hand and with a bag with two eggs. Two eggs was like gold. And she comes to the house and as I told you, you came down in the house, three steps to go in the house. And I saw that doll and I jumped on her. The eggs fell and they broke and that\u2019s the first doll that I had that closed and opened the eyes. It was -- I had it for years and it was the most fantastic thing. I don\u2019t think I was more than three and a half. Another memory in that particular place, except that the smell coming from the stables and I was so afraid of horses. And is that the Germans by the time they got to where \u2014 that\u2019s why we were lucky we didn\u2019t end up in a concentration camp cause it was close to Russia. They have some other worries and, but they were bombing. They were bombing and throwing \u2014 where do you go? There was no place to shelter from the bombs. So we used to run into an open space with a crater, previously made by another bomb and that\u2019s where we were lying down and I thought it was the greatest entertainment seeing the planes just going this way and that way and so on and so forth. Was very traumatic for me is that I grew up without a father. In 1944, when 45, when the war was over my father came home and I couldn\u2019t understand why do we have a strange man living in our house. And eventually he went back to work. They moved out \u2014"

The school, my mother always wanted the best for me, like any mother. And she sent me, it was a fortune to send me to that particular school. And it was very far away from home. And there was no way to get there except walking. And the schedule was you go in the morning. You come home for lunch. You go back and forth. If I would tell you, that was at least a mile and a half or two. But back then you let your child walk. There weren\u2019t too many cars. There were no street signs or lights or anything of that sort. But I hated going there because what do you teach rich people? You teach them manners, how to eat. You teach them how to waltz and tango and music and things like this. And I didn\u2019t like that at all because I already knew how to read and that was \u2014"

You don\u2019t\u2019 go to 12\u2122 grade but when you reach the tenth grade, you\u2019re done with high school. I remember an incident. I was very competitive and I always wanted to have straight A\u2019s.

What\u2019s a nine and what\u2019s a ten. You know. I had to be the best. So she said no. She said no. I said why don\u2019t you check us out? Let\u2019s see who knows more. So she, she put us in front of the class and started asking us from the whole material of the whole year you know. And I knew I\u2019m good at science because this is what I eventually did. You know I\u2019m never let her go. And that to me, it was beating anti-Semitism. Cause you have to do something. Not to keep your mouth shut. I could have, they could have, I don\u2019t know maybe throw me out from the school or something. You don\u2019t just do things like this, yes. So in the end I got the ten also.

And sure enough I came to the States. What a great time. We went to New York for several days. To the Statue of Liberty and did this and did that. We went to visit his uncle in Rochester. And then we went to a bar mitzvah in Detroit where he had a brother and one of the sons. We went to the bar mitzvah. Good time. And I left. He started bugging me. We should get married and we should get married, we should \u2014 I guess at this age if you\u2019ve known a person and you click you have to take a chance. We got married in October of 1971, in Israel of course we got married. And I came here and I knew it was going to be tough for a physician that comes from overseas. And I brought my parents cause I\u2019m an only child and I didn\u2019t want to leave them there. And we were still living in a small apartment that we \u2014 our first son who was born in 1973 was ten months old, something like this. We all lived in a one bedroom, huge beautiful apartment in Washington, DC, Fourth street cause Chaim worked at the Food and Drug Administration. He used to walk there. And there I have a baby, didn\u2019t \u2014 my English was not so good. I was, it\u2019s medical English that I knew. I didn\u2019t know conversational English. And I watched a lot of tv. I didn\u2019t understand. And then I went and I took a course at Georgetown, intensive course every day, every day, every day for a month and a half. This is all my education in English. And then my parents came and we moved into a tiny house not far from here. It was Lockridge, it\u2019s off University. And Chaim was the only one working. We had another baby and I said time for me. I have my parents. Time for me to return to my profession somehow. And I had the initial exam that I took that allows you to work under supervision, meaning to be again an intern and again a resident and so on and so forth. And I went to the University of Maryland, department of preventive medicine and I interviewed for a residency or an internship first. And they got me in that because I have two small children and I said I cannot spend my days running up and down hospital corridors. I was already 38. Just 39. [had a baby at 39. And I said I have to do something else. So I, what I start, I had my mother to help me so I did an internship at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, preventive medicine. I did a residency there. The residency included a paid master in public health from Johns Hopkins which I adored every minute. To do that. And, but it wasn\u2019t easy. You know you have two children. You have a husband, you have a house. It\u2019s not easy. I stayed with University of Maryland about four and a half years. When I decided that this is not for me. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Malvy Solomon 31 May 2, 2013 Academia 1s not for people that are open and frank and tell the truth like me. This is for people that know how to \u2014 not, it\u2019s just not for me. I\u2019m not this type of person. I come from a different background in which speaking up or telling the truth is the norm, not. And I told Chaim, even if it means never to work again, I can\u2019t do this type of work. Also, I was the lowest on the totem pole there and every project that nobody else wanted and I am the top w --. So I quit. Three months later, it was in 1984 I got a job with the Department of Veterans Affairs. I worked until 2010 and I did a mitzvah on a daily basis. I either helped the veteran or widow or a prisoner of war. I did something good. And there I am. I\u2019m 76 and looking back, would I change things? Probably not. It\u2019s not easy to live on three continents like I did. And you know people said how many languages do you speak? I say this and this and this and that. Oh how exciting. Not to me. I was forced into that. It\u2019s forced for Russian, forced for French. There Iam. I come here. I have to go to Johns Hopkins and write papers and do presentations. And then at the Department of Veterans Affairs, we have to, we had seminars and we had lectures there. Sometimes I didn\u2019t mind which is not for this. But if you make it clear and concise and have a good slides it goes. You know you can do it. And I remember being interviewed for the Shoah project and at the end they asked me so give us a final like a summary of \u2014 and I\u2019Il tell you exactly what I said because this 1s my summary if you want to ask me something else, Pll be happy to answer it. Look at me. I have two wonderful boys. Mention one has a PhD. The other one went to college and is a producer for a show. I have a beautiful house. I traveled all over the world. Ask me where I have not been. I have satisfied my hunger for classical music. Here and in New York. We went to the opera every year for three, four days. We stayed at the Park Hotel, across from Lincoln Center. I have seen Pavarotti and Domingo and everybody. I have been at La Scala in Milan. At the Covent Garden, Paris Opera. I have done everything. And you see this. This is my revenge over war, Nazi, communists and everybody else that against the Jews. If you push and you want, you can do it. And now you can ask me anything else.

We have here, my husband when he came you know in the 50s, he was in, he\u2019s a graduate of Michigan State and he was very specialized in botulism. He\u2019s a microbiologist. So when he came here, he worked. There was a -- he lived in downtown Washington and there was a church that became a synagogue on Fridays and that\u2019s where he met a lot of friends. They formed a group. They were saying -- it\u2019s when I came 42, 43 years ago almost, they were already a group. So it https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Malvy Solomon 33 May 2, 2013 must be 45, 50 years, there was a group. I don\u2019t think I ever fit in the American friendships or groups or, because I\u2019m different. I\u2019m very different because of my background, because of my \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I have different tastes, different opinion, different ideas. But we used to meet every Friday, not every Friday night, once a month either in one house. But then the kids grew up and there were too many so we used to hire here on University Boulevard, a place to have Purim parties and Hanukah parties. All the kids grew up, they\u2019re gone. Many of our group, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and lung cancer. Alzheimer\u2019s so we are unable to have a minyan anymore. So we don\u2019t see each other. And when we finally decide, it\u2019s either this one is sick or that one can\u2019t come. We don\u2019t have the group that we had before. Not that it meant a lot to me because they\u2019re different. My friend, for example, I'll give you an example. One of the group had breast cancer. I didn\u2019t know until she died. And she had a metastasis to the brain and she died. But to me this is not friendship. Tell me and maybe I can help. It\u2019s a different approach here. It\u2019s a different, it\u2019s the era of the telephone when you \u2014 I grew up. IfI have a friend, I come to the door and I get in. I open the refrigerator and it\u2019s not like this. It\u2019s different. I am different. I\u2019m, different background. For example in my society where I grew up, you can ask somebody how much do you make a year? That would be the greatest faux pas here. It would be different. It\u2019s very different. My idea of a friend is very different of what friendship is here. Friendship is here, let\u2019s get together and let\u2019s have dinner. No, that\u2019s not for me. To me a friend is somebody that a friend when I need you. Tell me what\u2019s wrong. Maybe I can do something for you, that\u2019s a friend you know. It has to be in good time and in bad time. Here it\u2019s only the good time. I don\u2019t have any good times now with, that Chaim is sick. Yes, they were very attentive. They called, they came, they asked, they inquired, they this, they that. It\u2019s not the same thing for me. What else do you \u2014"

So one day she tells me, Malvy I read a book. You have to read it. You have to read it. This book is called whatever, whatever. Of course I go and I get the book. So the book is about a family of very rich Iranian Jews who had a jewelry store. Their son was here in the States studying in the state and you know they are Jewish. I forgot to say, what\u2019s more important. They are Jewish. And it started with the shah and with the persecution there and of course, I know cause my son has a very good friend who run away from Iran. They went together to the Jewish Day School and he\u2019s a big doctor now. And https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Malvy Solomon 37 May 2, 2013 the book is about how they decided to run away because they knew they are not going to survive cause they were the shah\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9. They had Picassos and Renoirs in this all, already in Switzerland. They left with a little suitcase and one of their employees, they left the store with all the jewelries and everything so it wouldn\u2019t show that they are running away. They had a limo taking them over the border. They went to Paris and then they came here and so on and so forth. What\u2019s so terrific about \u2014 what\u2019s so incredible about that? You know why did you like the book so much? Oh it\u2019s interesting. Not to me. I went through hell to get out from Romania. I wish I were rich you know. So she was surprised. I said wait until I write a book. That\u2019s going to be interesting but I may be prejudiced. On the other hand I might be prejudiced because you know we were -- we weren\u2019t poor. We just were you know regular people. You know and we didn\u2019t have the fortunes and the Renoirs to tide us over and you know we went with no pennies, no money, no nothing. So maybe, I told her, I think my book would be much more interesting to you than this book. That\u2019s how but people who don\u2019t know. And many people I\u2019m telling you if I\u2014 I told you a lot of things, but sometimes I just tell little bit of snippets of what happened to me.
