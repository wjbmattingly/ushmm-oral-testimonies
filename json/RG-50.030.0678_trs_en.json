My father was practicing and my mother was a psychiatrist and we lived in that same house, same apartment, until we left Berlin, except for, I think, one week after the Kristallnacht where we heard some rumors that the Gestapo was coming and looking for people, so we moved to my grandmother's apartment, which was in West Berlin, in a different area which just temporarily."
