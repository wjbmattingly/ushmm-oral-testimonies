When I was liberated after the war \u2014 you know, I lived in Germany \u2014 ow \u2014 I came to this country in 1950, and I was liberated in 1945, so around five years I lived in Germany.

So we said, oh, as soon as you can, just get out from there, get out from there. Now, I made friends, we were three kids, we were holding like in a group, because sometimes you had to be protected from other people. Because sometimes you had a piece of bread, they \u2014 they could rip it out from your hands even, sometime. No, you can\u2019t blame people, they didn\u2019t have no control.

I wouldn\u2019t pick up something from the garbage that\u2019s \u2014 was ra \u2014 half rotten, something, I wouldn\u2019t pick it up, I would leave it. Some people didn\u2019t care, they \u2014 they took it and \u2014 or \u2014 or not only that, a lot of times people \u2014 the dead bodies, they used to throw them out by the door, and there was people that used to pick them up and bring them to the crematorium.

And they were hundred percent sure that the Jewish people, who in those days, I don\u2019t know, a million and \u2014 tops a million and a half or something like that, and the Arabs were in the hundred millions. There was Egypt, there was Lebanon, Syrian, Jordan. Jordan had a well equipped army with tanks and things. What the Jews, they had a couple of rifles, and things like that.

So says, we paid for it, but the \u2014 France didn't want to give them out. For what re \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the reason exactly why. So anyway, they took out the boats and that\u2019s how France stopped giving them no more \u2014 no \u2014 because they used to sa \u2014 sell them Mirage, the jets.
