So we said, oh, as soon as you can, just get out from there, get out from there. Now, I made friends, we were three kids, we were holding like in a group, because sometimes you had to be protected from other people.

So, when I was reading this Bible, you know, I \u0152 I believe in the Bible, beca \u0152 in the \u0152 in the five co \u0152 in the five books of Moses. And you have the New Testament, we have the Old Testament. So I said, that\u2122s the reason I want to se \u0152 I said, I am going to Israel. But, i-in those days, so the British we re against the \u0152 because they wanted the Arabs, they favored the Arabs. Now, the Jews, if they smuggled in weapons or something, they went \u0152 us ed to go in the kibbutzim, and confiscate the Jewish weapons and sell them to the Arabs or something like this. But th en it came a time that the Jews got a little bit stronger, and they started to fight back the British. I don\u2122t know if you remember it when they bombed the King David hotel, it was the \u0152 the British headquarters in Jerusalem, and a lot of British soldiers died. And they Interview with Sholom Rosenheck May 20, 2009 142started to suffer. You know, first they \u0152 they killed Jews and things, but then the Jews hit back, and they \u0152 they got the bea ting, too.

But before they giving up, they thought that the \u0152 they confiscated weapons from the Jews and gave them to the Arabs, and they took away the weapons from the Jews, but the Jews got weap \u0152 different \u0152 from different places they got weapons. And they were hundred percent sure that the Jewish people, who in those days, I don\u2122t know, a million and \u0152 tops a million and a half or something lik e that, and the Arabs were in the hundred millions. There was Egypt, there was Lebanon, Syrian, Jordan . Jordan had a well equipped army with tanks and things. What the Jews, they had a couple of rifles, and things like that. So anyway, the Jews didn\u2122t have no choice, but they went in le \u0152 illegally, on boats, you know, they came in. This ship, Exodus \u0152 come, I\u2122ll show you something, here."

Now they said oh, Israel attacked Egypt , now we gonna attack Israel. And they came down with the mountains with the tanks. But, going up on the tanks, when th \u0152 Israel was ready also with tanks they had already, because they got shipment. France helped Israel a Interview with Sholom Rosenheck May 20, 2009 147lot, Russians, Czechoslovakian. So they ha d already more weapons, and they caught a lot of Egyptian weapons. That\u2122s where they made. And also, they called those rockets, the rockets, you know, where they \u0152 to shoot up, and wit \u0152 that was the Vietnam war, I think it was that.

So says, we paid for it, but the \u0152 France didn't want to give them out. For what re \u0152 I don\u2122t remember the reason exactly why. So anyway, they took out the boats and that\u2122s how France stopped giving them no more \u0152 no \u0152 because they used to sa \u0152 sell them Mirage, the jets.
