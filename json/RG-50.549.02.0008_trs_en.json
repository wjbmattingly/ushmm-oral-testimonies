It was -- it was winter, snow was on the ground and anybody that fall out of line or couldn\u2019t keep it up, they ju -- they would just kill.

I suspect that I wasn\u2019t there very, very long in the orphanage setting, because the next memories that come up -- and this is where I now start to become a person and I do communicate with people, was when Dr. Kalina, who was one of the administrators of this hospital/orphanage complex, took me into his home. And I -- I -- I suspect that one of the reasons why he did that was because he and his wife were childless and that was a nice experience while it lasted. Subsequently, they did have a daughter born to them, Mimi was her name, the mother\u2019s name was Helena and he was Dr. Kalina. Nown Dr. Kalina. I can\u2019t remember his first name, though.

I knew I had a sister and I knew that somehow I was going to meet her and whenever things got tough, I said to myself, \u201c\u201cThis is -- I\u2019m going to do this for my sister.\u201d Whatever it was, whether it was a small problem or a big problem.

They bought a little goat. This story I don\u2019t think has been told ever. A little goat and I had sort of responsibly for it, it was in a sort of a gardened off or a fenced off area. And it was a very sweet sort of little thing and I fed it. I remember it pulling lettuce from my hands. That\u2019s a very sweet experience. He also -- Dr. Kalina, now that I\u2019m thinking about it -- he was -- he had an -- obviously an important position and he was somewhat well-to-do. He- he had one of the few cars that private citizens owned at the time. It was a green convertible and I guess as a boy I would have -- I would have loved to have driven that thing, but I enjoyed riding in it tremendously. There are other things about that experience with the Kalinas. They allowed me to do things and I especially remember Sundays. I don\u2019t know why I think of it as Sundays, but I\u2019m sure it was a Sunday, they would always give me a couple of coronas -- money -- Czecho -- Czechoslovakian. And they would let me go to -- to the local butcher store and I was able to purchase 10 decagrams of salami, which was the delicacy bar none for me. Once a week I was able to do that -- that little bit of pielites living with the Kalinas also. There were other things I recollect. It\u2019s the first time I think ve ever heard a phonograph. And they had a very fancy phonograph combination bar set, that opened up, the lights went on and there were glasses and played beautiful waltzes, music. These just -- little details, little details.

W-We looked just like the rest of the kids, we didn\u2019t publicly appear -- I mean we did not appear Jewish in any way. We didn\u2019t wear hats or yarmulkes or had long hair or anything like that. My only mark was my number. That branded me a Jew, however. And this other fellow, his name was Sobol, I don\u2019t think he had a number from any camp, but he was Jewish, they knew he was Jewish. Maybe he looked more Jewish than I did, if there\u2019s such a thing. But th-the boys, even the -- at that age, we were like eight, nine, 10, they were -- they were out there to beat us.

So then slowly, in 1985, she let us know, even though we knew -- I knew from records that she had been taken into Poland and she spent some very, very unpleasant, indeterminate num-number of months with a Polish family that -- right now I can almost surely say abused her, in terms of her being a child who was taken into a home to be taken care of. I think she was more like a servant, made to do things. Some of the things that she tells me are -- later on were to -- were to really go back, return to the site of Auschwitz and -- and hunt for the -- for some valuables in terms of gold -- gold teeth or what -- whatever. But not -- not the kind of home that you would expect a child would get. So -- and the stories that she has, I think are locked in her and perhaps one day Pll find out myself, more about it. But then -- then she was rescued from there by -- by a rescue organization -- rescue child organization from United States, that actually made it a point, because they knew that a lot of the Polish families would grab -- grab children and a lot of the Polish had hidden children that really didn\u2019t belong to them, but -- they were Jewish children and this being a Jewish oriented organization, they wanted to extricate the Jewish children from there and they went into a lot of trouble in terms of checking birth records, birth certificates and so on. And when something didn\u2019t quite match up in a family, they would know that they had a Jewish child and they took the Jewish child out. And from there she went to -- when she was taken out, she was taken -- as far as I know, to -- to France, to an orphanage in France."

Mrs. Maun, Edith Maun was a -- was a wonderful woman. She somehow had the understanding of what a boy should be or what a boy would like and there in that home, I first saw candles -- Friday night candles. And from that home I was also, for the first time taking in -- taken into a synagogue. I don\u2019t know if it was Orthodox -- it most probably was, cause Conservative and Reform were not born yet -- I don\u2019t believe were being practiced publicly in the little town of Kosheetza. And I remember being there on holidays, being dressed special. Not being inside the synagogue all that much, but I do remember having a lot of fights with the boys outside in the courtyard, we were throwing the chestnuts at ea -- at each other. But Mrs. Maun, getting back to her, cause I -- I have to just say some things about her that she understood so well. She knew that I wanted to play -- be a boy, be a real boy. And she managed somehow to -- to -- to get a bicycle for me. And it wasn\u2019t a child\u2019s bicycle, was a man\u2019s bicycle and I was smaller than a normal child, even for my age. So, to learn to ride this thing -- I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever seen a child riding a man\u2019s bicycle. The foot goes This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

With her and her other children, I also went ice skating on the river, where -- when it was frozen. And it -- 1t was a river, I knew that, because many times you could see the water flowing underneath, perhaps the ice wasn\u2019t thick enough for us, but we went on it anyway. What I do remember about the ice skates was that you would just screw these things onto your normal regular shoes, because we didn\u2019t have special shoes for skating, we just -- those were our -- our shoes and we just forced them onto our feet and there was a special key and they would just lock onto the shoes and we\u2019d be skating. I don\u2019t think I ever told that story to anyone, but it\u2019s wa -- some of the things I remember from there. Also, somewhere along the line, after this bicycle episode, somebody obtained for me, a very fancy -- they call it a jek -- there\u2019s a kolabeshka, but I think it\u2019s a -- I don\u2019t even know what the English word for it is here. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s some wheels, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a platform, a wheel on the back and the front and then there\u2019s a stand, what do you call that, a -- I\u2019m at a loss, totally at a loss.

So there wasn\u2019t much there, but duf -- I did feel a real family there, because Mr. Maun was a -- he\u2019s a very quiet but very strong man. He was a dental technician, yes.

And also, at the same time, we were somehow connected to the people in -- to my uncle in Germany. And there was sort of talk, letting it known -- be known that I might be going to -- to one of these places, that I'd be leaving them. And I -- there wa -- it was just talk and it didn\u2019t really phase me one way or the other, it was just talk. The -- the first thing that did happen, though as -- as a movement away from the Maun family -- at one point in time, I do remember going with- I\u2019m not quite sure now whether it was both of them or just one of them, the parents -- they were taking me to the -- to the border of Czechoslovakia and Germany, where I was to be met and taken to Germany. But we got to the border and somehow it never happened. We came back. I suspect now, from what I can gather, that at the same time, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection the Slotkin\u2019s somehow came on the scene and they, at this point had Irene, who was my twin sister and I guess it seemed much more sensible to try and unite the two twins into a home or just unite them, rather than keep them apart. So I came back into Czechoslovakia, back -- I mean I went back to Kosheetza with the Maun\u2019s and there we waited until some move was made by the Slotkin\u2019s. And that -- that this happened, it happened -- they had sent a Mr. Enright, who I think on his own right worked for -- for the children, possibly for this organization, but he was specifically sent out to see if he could find me. And he spent quite a few months -- over a year I think, maybe even two years, looking for me until I was located. But there are lots of coincidences that I\u2019d like to mention -- I should mention -- that happened, which made this possible. In -- in 1947, Life Magazine ran an issue which depicted my twin sister Irene as sort of a poster girl from -- from France, with a boy, Charles Karro and somehow th-their publicity was to raise funds for this organization and for the orphanage and for the children\u2019s welfare care. The Slotkins somehow got a hold of Irene, cause they were actively involved in helping war orphans and they were very close friends to Herbert Tenzer also, who lived 1n th -- in the same area that they lived in. And Irene came -- came to them. And that wasn\u2019t a -- quick as I make it sound, she went through a couple of homes, but she ended up with them and she told them that she had a brother somewhere. And so they started to look for me, realizing, I guess the importance -- as I think as a father now -- grandfather, I would do the same thing -- I -- I -- I -- if I knew that I had in possession a child who had a twin, especially from -- from that kind of a background, I would see if I -- if I could do This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection something, especially since they were able to do this. So they started looking for me. Now the Life Magazine that I mentioned before, this Life Magazine was obviously read by more than just the United States, but it -- 1t was read by people in Europe and in Israel, where Dr. Kalina was at the time. He saw the article and he realized that Irene Guttman, who was mentioned, I think, in the article as Guttman, maybe even Renata, I\u2019m not sure now. Renata or Irene, but Guttman was the -- was the name which I was under and the twin story and all that. So he made the connection and he said, \u201cI have this twin, I have the brother. I know where the brother 1s.\u201d So contacts were made and I was located in Kosheetza and then came the -- the red tape of getting me out, getting a -- I -- I look at it now and I laughing, I wa -- that little orphan, took them two years to get me out and even once I got here, I still had to go back once -- back into Germany, but that -- that\u2019s just a side issue of mine. But it took two years of red tape to get me out. I must say that in the time I spent in getting ready for it and the travel and -- and in France and -- I went to school in Switzerland. Went -- had to go to Frankfort and then once I got here, I had -- was returned back to Frankfort again. Was a red tape kind of a thing, I had to appear just for a weekend in Frankfort and then come back. But each one of these is -- is a little story by itself.

That could have been it, possibly because I was a Jewish displaced child and I was oriented to go or my -- the easiest way to get me out was to get me -- get me a visa to the newly created state of Israel.

It wa -- would have been a stopover, but it wasn\u2019t the final destination, so the -- these things didn\u2019t quite match, so they had to make them match. I think that\u2019s what made it so difficult. There are other difficulties too. They weren\u2019t legal, political maneuvers, but I -- I think that\u2019s truly -- the Mauns really cared for me. I mean I -- I think I spent -- I ha -- \u2019'm guessing, but I think I spent at least three years with them. And I think that, in that time frame, I could see me falling in love with a child that I took care of three years, even if the child wasn\u2019t the best child in the world. Which I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t, but I guess I was cute enough, judging from the pictures. I seemed to get along and obviously she showered me -- they showered me with their -- with their caring and I -- I remembered it\u2019s -- obviously there was a good relationship. I mean, so there are other things in play, but I think they realize that -- that my place would be -- I'll be better off in the long run with my sister in America. So, that was one issue. I - | think that the Kalinas, who were in a -- who made the connection and originally took me out of the orphanage also weren\u2019t quite sure whether to send me into this unknown and they had some say, because I was staying with their sister. So, I guess there was a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

As far as I was -- I was ready to go. I had some things which I unfortunately had to leave behind. I was an avid book reader and if I remember correctly, I don\u2019t think there were any libraries in Kosheetza, so whenever I wanted a book, I had to save for it and I had to buy it. So they became my personal possessions and I had quite a few of them and there were a few that -- they were American, or at least you\u2019d recognize them. James Fenimore Cooper, \u201cThe Last of the Mohicans\u201d was one of the books that I had translated -- that was translated into -- into Slovak and I was able to read that, so I was totally familiar with -- with the story. There was one word I -- that comes to mind, which I could never understand in -- in the west, it was greenhorn. The word greenhorn, I -- I just didn\u2019t know what it was. I know it wasn\u2019t a complimentary sort of a thing, but I could never understand it until I came to the States many, many years later, I learned what the true meaning of the word greenhorn was. There were other books that I loved. Jules Verne was my -- one of my favorite authors, science fiction. There\u2019s another man, Carrol May. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s -- hits anybody, but I mentioned it to a few people and apparently it hasn\u2019t, but I read some of his books. \u201cRobinson Crusoe\u201d was also one of my most favorite books."

He -- we -- we were in Paris together. I remember we stayed at the Grand Hotel and now we were sort of closer to the Slotkins, away from the Mauns and I\u2019Il never forget the first ttme they made a telephone connection with the Slotkins, I -- I hid under the bed. I didn\u2019t want to somehow respond or talk, even though I knew about them, I knew who they were. I mean, didn\u2019t know about them, but I knew they were the Slotkins, who -- where my sister was. But I was just totally shaken up by this. I\u2019m not even sure whether I talked to them that one time. But we lived in Switzerland together and -- I mean in -- in Paris together and there he would carry on during the day, doing his thing, whatever he had to do to get clearances for me and whatnot. And he engaged a teacher for me at the time, to teach me -- start teaching me Slovak. And part of the education was to go ahead and see as many foreign movies -- American movies, also English movies, so I would get used to -- I\u2019m sorry, I have to take all that back, not to teach me Slovak, to teach me English. And part of this whole thing was to take me to see English movies. And one of the first movies that I remember was \u201cLassie Come Back.\u201d Elizabeth Taylor, she was a girl at the time, a very beautiful girl, blue eyes, black hair, white skin. And there was this beautiful black horse. No, no, that\u2019s \u201cBlack Beauty\u2019, that\u2019s another one that I saw. But \u201cLassie\u201d was the first one. Also, there were cowboy movies I saw -- if I can try to remember some of those old names. That was way before Hopalong Cassidy came on the scene, it was -- oh, maybe I\u2019ll remember later. But that was part of it, Laurel and Hardy was certainly part of it. Abbott and Costello. These were movies I went to see, just to get This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I don\u2019t know how -- what I really achieved other than I was exposed to it. It seemed that though, that Mr. Enright didn\u2019t have much luck in getting whatever papers were necessary to get me over here right away, so -- there was -- and he couldn\u2019t spend any more time or something like that, so I had to be brought somewhere, put away somewhere -- who to leave we -- me with. So it was decided to send me to -- to Switzerland, to a boarding school. Institute Usher, in Balaban, which was Jewish oriented I\u2019m sure, because the headmaster of the school had a beard and a yarmulke and I do remember Friday night services, now that I think about it and we always stood up to La hoda di lacross kallor, which is one of the prayers that we say in our Friday nights also, but we sit down, where we always stood there. Now I know why I stand. I always stand, for some reason, La hoda di lacross kallor, sa -- sa -- about two pages responsive kind of reading on Friday night. But most people sit down. I always stand. There are a few other people that stand, but now I know where I got it from. They always stood over there. That was Switzerland. And that was a -- that was a really, really wonderful experience. I went skiing there. I do remember going skiing. We would get on to buses, which would take us, even though it was a rainy, cloudy day, would take -- they would -- the buses would take us into the mountains, above the clouds, into bright blue skies and sunshine and we would ski. The school also has other -- lots of good memories. At this point, I had the funds, now I had the backer -- a rich backer in America, my sister and her -- her future adoptive parents.

I remember it was a very specific kind of a marshmallow chocolate covered candy, very delicious. One other thing about the school, which I remember very, very clearly. We lived in a dorm -- in dormitory -- rooms and every morning we went to the showers in another building, while it was still dark and cold sometimes -- very, very cold. So we ran through whatever yard there was in our nightclothes and into these showers, which were somehow automatically regulated. You get into them -- they lasted only so long, the water started from lukewarm to warm and then it slowly start to cool. So you had to do your thing. You had to get soaped up and you had to get clean and still try and enjoy some of the warmth that was left after you\u2019ve done what you had to do. But, that it ran cold and if you were brave enough, you stayed in. And it turned out to be a lot of kids did stay in, most of us did. And it sort of -- it was a very healthy thing to do, because I don\u2019t ever remember being sick. None of them ever got sick and we ran wet -- half wet into our- into our rooms from -- from the bathhouse. I do -- that was something I remember again about my stay in Switzerland. There I learned also -- there they put me on a program to learn Hebrew. So I started writing, copying things in Hebrew, even though I had no idea what I was -- what I was saying, but writing, copying things in Hebrew and trying to pronounce some of the things, Hebrew started then for me."

I had my own room, which was different than the -- what I\u2019ve had before, although I had privacy in -- in the slo -- in the Maun house. They -- they recognize that I needed the privacy. Here I had my own bedroom, my own furniture, my own desk, my own chair. One of the first things that they did was to get me a bicycle. Again bicycle. Pretty important, I guess, to a -- to a 12 year old. And they were giving me everything that they thought I didn\u2019t have -- physically, materially. I think that they -- they both were very intelligent people. They gave me everything they knew how to give me. How -- what -- their best of ability, they gave me whatever they could. Whether they were like real parents -- because this question I ask myself, Pll never know. I\u2019ll never know what it\u2019s like to really have a real parent. What do you owe a real parent? What sort of honor you owe a parent when they\u2019re -- when you know that they\u2019re not yours, really, when you meet them first when you\u2019re 12 years old or when you -- when you know that they\u2019re your real blood?

There were people who wanted to write books about, very famous Jewish author, escapes my -- my memory right now, but he wanted to write a book about us. But they didn\u2019t want to dig up any of the old memories and they totally shielded Irene and myself from anything. So they sign -- signed away some of the rights that we might have had and I think that was a mistake, in a sense, because sooner or later, we would grow up and we did grow up and we do question these things and -- and we feel that we have a responsibility to our past and therefore to the future. And we have a responsibility to our own children and these things should be known. It\u2019s not something to hide, to be ashamed of. It happened. It happened and -- and you have to admit it that it happened and we have to bring it to the forefront if you want to learn something from it.

I -- I don\u2019t think the Jewish community on the whole was ready to even talk about it. They were still in a state of shock. I mean historically speaking, it just happened and -- and they were not ready to talk about it or to discuss it and I think that, in the very beginning, my sister might have even felt ashamed. Incredible as that may seem. I -- I think I felt a little bit of that, too. I did not always expose my number freely. It was always a sign of a Jew and in- the sign of a Jew in Europe was not a good sign, it\u2019s something to -- a low sign, something to be ashamed of. It wasn\u2019t something that you were proud of. Today I -- I\u2019m very proud of it and I feel very lucky that I\u2019m a survivor of this thing. But at that time, it - it was not. So in school, I think the teachers knew about us. I think the community knew about us. But very few really discussed it with us. I think they treated us gently because of it, but I don\u2019t -- nobody ever talked about it, it was not -- 1t was a taboo subject and I think Slotkins most probably made a contribution to that, but they were just like the rest of the people. They would not want to talk about -- this 1s something -- let\u2019s -- let\u2019s -- let\u2019s give them what they missed, let\u2019s shield them, let\u2019s -- let\u2019s forget about it. And I think a lot of parents did this to their children that were linked closely to the Holocaust. I think they did it to their offsprings. Why should they -- why should they suffer, why should they know about this? Just looking back, I -- I don\u2019t think that was exactly the right thing, but it was understandable.

Much more so than some of the others that I\u2019ve met and I\u2019ve met most of them, especially in Israel in 1985, when we had a -- a convention to have a mock trial for Dr. Mengele and I met -- were twins from all over the world and I must say that maybe five percent are what This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

There was a war on that the United States was involved in and th-the draft was still in full swing. And I was seriously seeing a girl. I was, I think 21. 20 - 21, something like that.

If you were the sole caretaker of somebody, your family, whatnot. But none of these things applied to me, so they were going to draft me for two years, send me over somewhere and -- to fight in a war. Now, when I told my family about this and my friends, they all said, \u201cYou? In a war? At this point in your life? What are you -- there\u2019s no way -- no way you can go. There\u2019s no way they\u2019 ll take you if you even -- if you tell them what your background is and that you can\u2019t do it.\u201d But I -- I never- I listened to what they said, but I never took advantage of that -- sort of -- of that situation, 1n -- in the sense that I would use it as an excuse. I didn\u2019t want to go into a war or anything like that, either. To me, at the time, the only thing that was really worth dying for, was maybe the Jewish state.

I didn\u2019t want to go, but I -- I was going to submit to it. So I did the next best thing, I joined a six months -- which for me was the best thing -- I joined a six months active unit and then I was in the reserve for the next seven years, which means going to meetings throughout the year and every summer for two years I had to go to Camp Drum, upstate New York to train and whatnot. So I -- I joined the National Guard and I was inducted into the army at Fort Dix, New Jersey, had my basic training there, went through all the bologna. But, I maintained a strict kosher Jewish front. I had the strength to do that. I wore my yarmulke, I refused any food, I refused to work on Saturdays. But I was a good soldier.

So, he was very proud of me. My Slotkin, he\u2019s a sharpshooter. I was a sharpshooter. But I went strictly by the laws, the -- at the time, in New Jersey, Fort Dix, they had a chaplain, chaplain -- a Lieutenant Colonel Angle, I think was his name. But he had made a set of rules for all the observant Jews. If they want to maintain their observance while they\u2019re in the army, they have to follow the rules to the letter, not deviate, they\u2019ll be no deviation. Everybody had to do exactly the same thing. And it worked.

            "answer": "Well, it -- it -- it was difficult to develop something like this because when my first marriage start to break up, and the kids were still pretty young. After seven years, my -- the oldest was maybe six and down the line of four, sometimes two years apart and then two more years apart. So, when that split took place -- first of all, community looked at divorce differently than it does today. It was a -- almost a taboo kind of a situation, especially in Orthodox circles. And obviously there was going to be a -- there was a -- an actual separation from me and my children. I did spend an awful lot of time with them, though, while we were together and I think that always showed. And one of my stipulations to our separation agreement was that I must -- must have the children on -- on weekends. I mean, not every weekend, but there must be a time, I felt, when -- when the father and his children have to live together like a family. Because visitation for two hours on a Sunday afternoon, I felt was an absolute waste of time. Maybe better not to even have it. Cause it would interfere too much. In the long run with -- kids have parties, kids have this to do. Why do you we have to w-wait until he picks us up to take us to a -- I think life had to be lived together. An evening had to be spent, a -- a bath had to be given. Sa -- you know, you had to live together. So that was part of my sep-separation agreement, that I would have them at least two -- I think it was at least every other weekend and also in the summertime, I would have them for at least a month, full time.

I had so much change, I tried to keep their lifestyle flowing, as it was before, when I was there. In other words, I tried to keep them in the same schools, in the same environment, with the same friends. That was my -- my goal to do and try to keep everything as normal as -- as possible. Even keeled with me and so on. And I don\u2019t really know, even now, to what extent I succeeded. I -- my two -- David and Corrie are married. My oldest son is not married yet. So I always wonder -- 1s he not married because something I did? Did I put some guilt or did he s -- is he suffering from the divorce, or is he suffering from second generation syndromes, which are very popular now, that everybody talks about -- I just wonder. But I -- I have to say that all three of them are totally different individuals, I recognized it early in life. They had different interests. They had to be treated differently, they were little, individual people. And when my oldest son I -- I mean even when he start to -- when he became an adult, which I -- I term roughly after voting age, you know, I gave him more free reign. You can no longer dictate what he\u2019s to do and how to do it. You can advise, I realize that -- which is something I -- I think I learned in a negative way from my father, Meyer Slotkin, which he didn\u2019t really allow me. But I allowed this, that it\u2019s his own -- it\u2019s going to be his life and I wish he would take my advice and this and that, but you know, you can\u2019t -- even today I can\u2019t -- I won\u2019t even get into a real hassle with my son about anything that he really wants to do.

And my -- my -- my Mia, the lo-love of my life, with the love of my life, June. I -- I -- I have to say about June, she is the best woman in the world, my wife of 25 years. She helped me raise those three children. I mean she\u2019s -- it wasn\u2019t a sacrifice to her. She had them with me and we had them in our house. Now here she is, a woman, three children -- my children, they were not her children and I must say she treated them, she treated them as well as she treats Mia -- like in -- I have a source for comparison. She treated them as her own, as much as that was possible under the circumstances, for the weekends that we had and the summers that they spent together. And I say they spent together -- she\u2019s a teacher, so they went out to -- to a resort -- Fire Island, specifically speaking -- and they had a wonderful time. The kids still talk about it. And I went to work most of the week -- I took a lot of time off also. I -- I worked -- actually I did everything in reverse. I worked three days and the rest of the time I spent out there. Right. I worked three days a week and the rest of the time I spent out there with them. We had a wonderful time as a family. We lived there as a family. It was -- it was wonderful. And just brings to mind, my daughter Mia, whenever we show pictures of -- of Fire Island and the -- June and myself and the three kids, she says, \u201cWell, where am I? Where am I?\u201d And we have to tell her that she wasn\u2019t on the scene yet, she wasn\u2019t even born yet. And -- but she -- she knows, she -- they were very close -- my daughter Mia 1s very close with the three kids. They -- they know that they\u2019re brothers and sister. They\u2019re related and they -- they talk constantly, they keep in touch. And that\u2019s one of the things that I -- now that we\u2019re talking about a little bit philosophy, I keep This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They\u2019re all in touch with each -- with each other. And perhaps my son Zebbe was affected by that a little bit in a negative way. Maybe he felt responsible for the two others and somehow he lost something of his own identity in it. But, I really can\u2019t worry about that, because that\u2019s not a healthy thing to do. It\u2019s his life, he had all the options -- he has all the options -- he still does. I mean, he can do whatever he wants, as long as he\u2019s behaving himself now. He ca -- he\u2019s -- he\u2019s a free man, he\u2019s -- he\u2019s a free man. My philosophy basically was to let them do, know that they should depend on each other, stick together as a family. I never tried to push my -- my f - my background into them. I never told them the stories, never force fed them. They -- they were starting to come out and ask. They started asking in 1985, when they first became aware. And my son Zebbe, especially now, he\u2019s -- he\u2019s truly into it. He really is into the -- he\u2019s a photographer also, so he -- he does a lot with that. Somehow he manages to express, he -- he took all the photos that we were able to get from Europe and he arranged them, I have the albums here. And he sort of put meaning to them, I mean he- he -- he\u2019s very meticulous and he tried to s -- you know, put them in chronological order and he -- I think he made an album for Irene, a copy for myself and he -- he\u2019s into - he\u2019s into it.

My father, Meyer Slotkin was best friend with -- with a gentleman called Daniel Meyers, this is down in Lawrence, Long Island, who used to pick us up.

So they introduced us. And so we actually met for the first time, a few hundred yards from where I sit now. And this was 1970, I think. \u201869 - 1970. And our first impressions -- I remember I didn\u2019t want to come into the city, but he said, \u201cOh come, please, we --\u2019\u2019, I said, \u201cLook, I know you want to meet -- you want to make us some kind of a shiddock, you wanted me -- me to meet some girl, or this,\u201d said, \u201cplease, I am not interested, I don\u2019t want it, I\u2019m not ready for any of this.

And I was pretty disturbed, in a negative way, I didn\u2019t want any part of this. I found out later -- many years later, that when June saw me walk through the door, she said to herself, \u201c\u201cThere\u2019s the man I\u2019m going to marry.\u201d So first impressions is what sometimes work and sometimes they don\u2019t work. But they\u2019re a valuable tool for some, I guess. So that\u2019s where I met June. And we started dating very, very slowly. I must admit, she was first much more aggressive than I was. But I saw the value of her -- she\u2019s a wonderful person, just a marvelous person. Then, after a couple of years, I turned to -- I turned to be more aggressive, because she was going away every summer and I started feeling lonely and this and that and so once we made up our minds, we -- I proposed to her.

I -- I have to mention at this point also that at one point in time, the two oldest ones, they actually left their mother\u2019s homes to come to us -- to live with us. And we made provisions here for that. Corrie, my ol -- the youngest, the last one left, didn\u2019t have the strength or didn\u2019t want to -- or didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t leave her mother alone or something. So that never happened. But -- at the -- when the marriage took place, it was still -- feelings were still very raw. There was a lot of animosity and there was -- was a new thing. So, we wanted the kids to come to the wedding, but we couldn\u2019t announce it freely to my ex-wife, because that would not have worked. So -- and the children were so young, that we couldn\u2019t even tell them, the wedding is going to take place at a certain time and we had to have them dressed. So I remember, very distinctly, we --we went to buy them suits. We purchased them at J.C. Penney, I remember that very distinctly, they were the suits -- we tried to guess their sizes and dress and whatnot and that weekend that they came -- we were married on a Sunday -- we told them about this and it was quite a shock for them to realize that we were going to get married, cause -- I mean they knew us as being together, but this is a different ball game. This sort of made it irreversible or whatever. But it -- 1t was hard and I even at the -- at the wedding, I have a few pictures where I see Zebbe sitting alone and some photographer caught me tal -- trying to talk to him, his head down and -- he wasn\u2019t upset about the food, he was upset about what was taking place. So I think it was a hard thing for them, but I think that now they realize how happy we are and they -- they constantly want to come here.

Two years prior to \u201885, there was a convention in Philadelphia, a Holocaust convention, which I never really paid much attention to by -- by Mr. Mead and his wife and they had these annual get-togethers, but it never interest us, because we were protected from it, we were -- we\u2019re just not part of that scene at all.

She was a very forceful lady and she said we -- we -- we owe it to ourselves, we owe it to our children, we owe it to the future, we owe it to mankind period, just to talk a little bit and let them know what -- what happened. Whatever the result of that 1s, 1s -- is up to history to judge, but we owe it to the people. We owe it to ourselves. And being that I and a -- I and -- and my sister and we never talked about it, it- it was just -- seemed like might be very interesting to hear it from somebody else, even though we knew that we were there, 100 percent, because we had some pictures, we had the numbers. We wanted to, I think, make contact with others who were in the same -- same situation. So, we -- we\u2019ve -- we made contact with them, we joined the organization and in 1985, Eva Core made this -- was the head -- head of this mock trial for Dr. Mengele, to which all the twins in the world were invited.

We still did not feel free to talk to the Slotkins. Now, my father had passed away already. He passed away in 81 - \u201882, but my mother was still around. She was still from the old school and even though she now knew that we were public with it, and we appeared on shows and Irene lectures and this and that, she still -- it wasn\u2019t something that was good for Irene to do, because she was totally protected.

And I guess I held back a lot of things, too and I\u2019m only saying this empirically speaking now, because I know how much more information we let out since 1985.

In addition to the media exposure that -- when we were hot, in 1985 and Mengele was on the front page and we were flown out to California once, I remember, to a show -- we were on the Good Morning Show here and this and that, but, you know, this was just few short questions, answering to the people and -- and, you -- you know, you were prepped for this, basically.

And the Bronx High School of Science, that was the last one that I a-attended a class there -- a -- high school students. And there were -- they\u2019re studying the Holocaust and they have a very extensive Holocaust exhibition down in their basement as part of their library. Very, very intense, one of the best. And they -- they really wanted to get into it, because they ju -- there was just no way they could get it from history.
