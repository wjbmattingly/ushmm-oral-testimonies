I'm Gretchen Skidmore, the host of the museum's\npublic program First Person. Thank you all for joining us. This is our 14th year of the program.\nOur First Person today is Martin Weiss whom we shall meet shortly.\nThis 2013 season of First Person is made possible through the\ngenerosity of the Louis Franklin Smith Foundation to whom we are very grateful for again\nsupporting First Person. And today we are honored to have Louis Smith with us who is in the\nfront row. So thanks again.\nFirst Person is a weekly conversation with survivors of the\nHolocaust who share with us their first-hand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust.\nEach guest serves as a volunteer here at this museum. Our program will continue until\nmid-August. The Museum's website, www.ushmm.org, provides information about each of our\nupcoming First Person guests.\nMartin Weiss will share with us his First Person account as a\nHolocaust survivor for about 45 minutes today. If time allows towards the end of the program,\nwe'll have an opportunity to ask him a few questions.\nThe life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades.\nWhat you are about to hear from Martin Weiss is one individual's account of the Holocaust.\nWe have prepared a brief slide presentation to help with his introduction.\nThis is a 1946 portrait of Martin Weiss. Martin was born in\nPolana, Czechoslovakia, in 1929. In 1939, Germany occupied one half of Czechoslovakia and\nHungary the other half. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, conditions in\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nPolana worsened. By 1944 Martin's family was transported to the Munkacs ghetto. In May\nthey were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau killing center where Martin, his father, brother, and\ntwo uncles were selected for forced labor. Later Martin and his father were sent to\nMauthausen concentration camp in Austria.\nHere we see a document recently uncovered in the ITS archive.\nThis document is a Prisoner Registration Card which reflects Martin's transfer from Auschwitz\non May 21, 1944, to Mauthausen, May 28, 1944. His prisoner number is on the upper\nright-hand corner: Ung-Jude or Hungarian Jew. His name is on the upper left-hand corner.\nThere you see it\u2019s circled.\nSO we are very, very pleased today to have the opportunity to\ntalk with Marty who has been a volunteer here at the museum -- we had a debate about this\nearlier -- for about 12 years. We are also really honored today to have his daughter Gail in the\nfront row. He has two children, four grandchildren. And we are today all very much missing\nJoan, his wife of over 50 years who recently passed away.\nSo, Marty, we know that today we are so fortunate to have you\nwith us. We thank you so much for your willingness to do First Person. So I'm going to invite\nyou up to the stage, and we'll have a conversation.\n[Applause]\n| think we have so much to cover today. We wanted to start by\nasking you, Marty, to talk a little bit about your life as a young boy in Czechoslovakia before\nthe war, about what life was like in your town and with your family and your community.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ;\n>> Martin Weiss: | grew up in a part of Czechoslovakia. I'll explain a little bit. It's not\nCzechoslovakia now. You only have the Czech Republic. Before there was Czech, Slovakia,\nand Ruse, they called it. Most of the population was Russian speaking. However, not like\nRussia, like deeper Russia, this was like European Russian; like most of the people there were\nRussian.\nThe reason I'm explaining, then the war came. We were\noccupied by Hungary. So it was Hungary from 1939 to 1945. And then in 1945, actually it was\npart of Russia, under Russia. And now it's Ukraine. So if | lived there all of this time, | would\nhave lived in all of those countries; however, it would be the same place.\nLife, as | remember it when | was growing up, was very nice.\nCzechoslovakia was a democracy. There was -- a few democracies in Europe at the time.\nPoland was a dictatorship. Hungary had a dictatorship of some sense. We felt very, very\nfortunate.\n| remember even when | was in grade school, we knew the\nvalue of democracy. One thing | remember they would teach us about democracy, in third\ngrade we elected a president of the class just to show us how it was done. Those little things\ndon't sound very important, but to us at the time it was very, very -- | remember as a kid, it\nmeant a lot.\nMy father was in business. We also did our own farming. We\nhad a farm. | had older brothers. They did all the work, consequently. As they got older, my\nfather didn't pay them so they went to the city to look for jobs to get paid.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nIn the meantime, | had one older brother left home. | was\ngrowing up, so | was about -- let's see, when the Hungarians came, | was about 10. When |\nwas 11, 12, my older brother and | did most of the farming. We plowed with horses, the old\nway, like you see in the picture. And we did all kinds of work. Also, it was a business. We did\nthat, too.\n>> Gretchen Skidmore: How big was your family?\n>> Martin Weiss: There was nine of us: four boys and five girls. Might as well say it now, we\nwent to camp, actually my two younger sisters and my mother died immediately in Auschwitz,\nas soon as we got there. | had an older sister. She died towards the end of the war, the very\nend of the war. My father was with me. He died where | was in a working camp. And my\nolder brother, he was a very healthy, strong guy. Believe it or not, supposedly he was\nliberated, but he disappeared. We never heard of him. Something happened to him. There\nare rumors what happened to him, that another fellow, inmate, killed him. But | don't Know for\na fact.\nSo basically that's what happened to my family. The rest of\nthem did survive. | had one sister, by the way, that was very smart. She was working on\npapers to go to the United States. In 1939, just about two weeks before the occupation, she\nwas lucky enough she got out. She got the papers. She got out. She went to the United\nStates all by herself. You have to remember we had no money. She didn't have any money. |\ndon't know how she did it. But somehow -- and by the way, other people were waiting for a\nvisa for the United States for five, six years and couldn't get it. Somehow she did it in a very\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nshort time.\nThe reason | mention this, because later on, after the war was\nover, she was instrumental of getting us affidavits for my sister and | and were able to come to\nthe United States rather quickly after the war. | just wanted to cover that.\n>> Gretchen Skidmore: So you and your family felt like you had full rights in your town and in\nyour community. You never had any sense of any differences?\n>> Martin Weiss: No. We felt we were citizens. Period. Nobody pushed us around or\nanything.\n>> Gretchen Skidmore: And how did life change, then, when the occupation, Hungarian,\noccupied your part of Czechoslovakia?\n>> Martin Weiss: Life changed almost immediately. Even 10 years old, we knew right away\nthings were not good. One of the reasons it changed, the whole form of government -- first of\nall, they used to have a mayor was voted by the people. All of a sudden now the mayor was\nappointed by somebody. Usually you had to be sort of a Nazi sympathizer. And then, of\ncourse, came out the laws, confiscated all Jewish-owned businesses. If people had a job, like\nlet's say they were a teacher or whatever, they lost it. My sister was going to school, like\ncollege. She was sent home. She couldn't continue. And so on. So we were affected\nimmediately.\nMy father was old enough, served in World War | under the\nHungarian Empire at the time. He says, well, the Hungarians are anti-Semitic but they're not\nso bad, you could get along with them. Well, it turned out, as time went on, they came out and\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nthey were very, very nasty. What they were doing is copying what the Germans were doing in\nGermany. They were doing it in Hungary. In Germany they passed a law. They also passed\nthe same law.\nAnd this continued -- around 1940, 1941, they had a\nmobilization. All the Jewish men military age, which was from about 20 to 45, were inducted\ninto the Army. Not the Army, because we were politically undesirable. Ok? So they put them\ninto -- they wore civilian clothes. They called it working battalion. What they used them for,\nthey wanted them off the street so they couldn't organize to be an underground or something\nlike that. So they took all of those men, had them under Army jurisdiction. They used them for\ncutting down the forest. They went to work and used them. Like, my two brothers ended up in\nthe Ukraine, on the Russian front.\nAnd over there things were terrible not only for them but even for\nthe Germans, even for the Hungarians. The conditions were not good. But they were under\nvery, very -- how do | put it -- had no rights of any kind. My brothers, they used them for\npicking minefields or burying the dead, doing those kinds of chores. | often wondered: why\ndidn't they escape? They had a chance to escape because they were not locked up. Like ina\nconcentration camp you couldn't, but over there.\nAnd the reason was very simple. They came from a culture, our\nupbringing -- excuse me -- that you can't be responsible for somebody else's death. So what\nthe Hungarians were doing, they copied again from the Germans. If somebody escaped, they\nwould take the company of men, line them up on a field, and just count up to 10 and shoot\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nevery 10th person. So because of that, they didn't escape because they were afraid of being\nresponsible for someone else's death. Excuse me.\nAs time went on, the conditions got worse and worse. It was\nvery, very severe. Oddly enough, like | said, the population were Russian. They didn't like the\nHungarians any more than we did. Politically we were on the same side. We were against\nthem. However, people are very funny at certain times. A certain amount of people -- I'm not\ngoing to say everybody. There were good people. You got along with them, lived alongside of\nthem just like in the United States: the Irish, Spanish, whatever, don't care. And we were\nbasically the same. However, there was always a few that for the slightest little advantage\nthey would go and squeal on you or give you up to the police, something like that.\nThere were people you try to give them help. Believe it or not,\nwe had to be so careful that my mother used to take my two younger sisters to carry a bag of\nsandwiches, like on the other side of town but that nobody should get suspicious. You would\nnever know who would give us up. And the punishment was very severe. So we had to be\nvery, very careful. This was just one of the things of how life went on.\nll jump ahead to 1944. In the meantime, we kept hearing all the\natrocities taking place in Poland and Ukraine. And by the way, we lived, it just so happened,\nonly about 25, 30-kilometers away from the Polish border. So the Russians, at that time they\nhad split Poland in half. Russia had one half of Poland and Germany had the other half. So\nthe Russians were close to us. SO many men would escape to the Russian side to go and\njoin. What happened is, as this was going on, they were very strict in watching what people\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,\nwere doing because they figured somebody was -- how can | put it -- aiding and abetting these\npeople. All somebody had to do was whisper that you did something and you were arrested\nand given the third degree. This is the way life was.\nJumping ahead now, this went on all the way up through 1944.\n1944, like | say, we kept hearing atrocities but, more significantly, kept hearing atrocities that\nwere almost unbelievable. Even though | was very young, | remember my father talking about\nit, to other people. And myself, even though | was young, you understood. How could the\nGermans do that? You have to remember, Germany was in science, medicine, music. They\nwere ahead of the rest of the world. How could they do this? So we heard these stories, very\ndescriptive stories. But we could not quite understand that Germans could do this. Ok? You\nbelieved it, but we could not believe it. | Know it sounds contradictory.\nThen we heard specific stories like from the Warsaw Ghetto, that\nthey were taking people and putting them into the Army truck with a canvas over it and then\nthey would drive around with the truck, put the exhaust into the back of the truck, and drive\naround until the people were gassed to death. We heard those stories. Then we heard of\nmassacres, big massacres. They had a group called Einzatsgruppen. Their job went into\nRussian, Ukraine, Eastern Europe. They were going -- they had what -- that's what they called\na Blitzkrieg. The Russians couldn't stand up to them. They would slice right through it. They\nhad this Einzatsgruppen --\n>> Gretchen Skidmore: The English words for that are mobile killing unit. So there were four\ndifferent units that followed the armed forces.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection P\n>> Martin Weiss: The mobile killing units were literally following like a sweeper, would come to\nsweep up. They would go into every single town and village. It didn't matter, some villages\nbelieve it or not, had like five Jewish families, some had 105 or some had 20,000. They would\njust go and literally, like a sweeper, just sweep up all the people, take them to a field and just\nkill them; like that. This went on for years.\n>> Gretchen Skidmore: Was there an involvement of your neighbor in one of those?\n>> Martin Weiss: Yeah.\n>> Gretchen Skidmore: Can you talk about that?\n>> Martin Weiss: Yeah. | had one neighbor, he was not a nice man even as it was. But we\ndid some business with him because we needed him, again, because we were doing business\nselling stuff to the Army. And we were not allowed to because -- it was politically undesirable.\nSo we used him as a partner. We did all the work, but we shared the profits. Anyway, he\njoined the Army, the Hungarian Army. And he was up in the Ukraine.\nAs | mentioned, the Germans were doing this as the Hungarian\ntroops. And like | say, a lot of people that were there in the working battalions. | had a cousin,\na second cousin actually, he was there and he recognized him. He was there. He was a\nsergeant. He was one of those committing atrocities. They were throwing women and\nchildren into the river. There was a river. And this river had bodies floating every single day,\nhundreds and hundreds of people every day. They threw them in. Sometimes the guards on a\nbridge would have nothing to do, so for fun they would go -- and by the way, they took a lot of\nJews at that time from different areas and they brought them out, fixed them up, but they didn't\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nhave the camps yet. Auschwitz didn't exist yet. That was the earlier part. So they let them\nloose in the Ukraine. And it was a very inhospitable place. It was very cold. Most of the\npeople were very poor. They didn't have any decent shoes or clothing. They didn't have\nany -- they had mostly sheets. They threw something in a pillowcase or sheets. They had\nbuttons on their shoulders. That's all they had with them. The climate in World War II was\nextremely cold. And that part of the world, 30 below zero was not uncommon. It was just very,\nvery cold. And they were cold under those conditions anyway.\nGetting back to this bridge, they would stand there. The stories\nwe got actually from this cousin of mine. They would go and round -- get these people and\ngive them a hard time. They would take the child, tear it out of their mother's arms, and bash\nthe child against the rock. And while the mother was pleading, and only then, would they\nthrow the mother in. So when you hear stories like this, all of a sudden you become a believer.\nBefore we couldn't rationalize it, but now we realize things are really happening.\n>> Gretchen Skidmore: So given those stories that were coming back, did your family -- did\nyou and your family ever think about going into hiding?\n>> Martin Weiss: Yes. We thought of going into hiding, definitely because my father was that\ntype. But problem was we had no place to go. We didn't have the means to do it. Not like in\nthe United States you could go to work, get in a car, get on a train. Over there, first of all, if\nyou had the means, where were you going to go? You couldn't even trust -- like | say, the\npopulation where we lived were against the government, yet we couldn't even trust them. We\ndidn't know whom to trust.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 5\nIn fact, we were thinking of leaving my sisters with some\nneighbors. And the neighbors would have readily taken them. But then we were worried that\none of the other neighbors would point them out to the police and then they would be left alone\nand they would pick them up by themselves. So we had to make choices. So we decided to\nstick together.\nOf course, in spite what we heard -- we never heard of\nAuschwitz, by the way, at all. We heard of massacre. So what happened -- | could go on, but\nI'll just skip.\nIn 1944, finally, we were like most of the Jews from the other\npart, like Poland, Lithuania, all those parts of the world; they took them out to that part and\nkilled them en masse. But our part they left for later. Because at first the Hungarian\ngovernment said we were citizens and they didn't want to give us up, but then, even though\nthey didn't like us and they mistreated us, however they felt that we still belonged there.\nSo about 1944 they made a deal. And when the Germans came to ask for the Jews again, this\ntime they said, oh, you want them? Sure.\nSo the government -- by the way, they had a change in\ngovernment, too. And the government went to work and two months, wasn't the Germans but\nthe Hungarians, picked up 150,000 people, in two months. They shipped them out to\nAuschwitz. Later we found out it was Auschwitz. So out of those, believe it or not, | would\ndare say that 80% of them never came back. That gives you an idea, you know, of what\nhappened.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nSo we were picked up, sent to the ghetto. From there we were\nsent to Auschwitz. Now we were worried because we were put on a train. By the way, there\nwere boxcars. You took a tour. We were going 125, 135 people per box car. This is women\nand children, no facilities no water, nothing. Locked in there. Now, of course, all we had was\nfear. Nothing else. By the time we came to Auschwitz, quite a few people on the cars died\nbecause they were old, they suffocated, or the children were crying, screaming, were hungry.\nWe came to Auschwitz. It was at night, about 12:00. We pulled\ninto camp. Again, | must emphasize we never heard of Auschwitz. We heard of, like | said, all\nthe killings and stuff. So we should have expected anything. We knew we came into Poland\nwe got worried because we heard of all the things that were happening there.\nThey had us disembark. As soon as we disembarked from the\ntrain, there were guys there with uniforms and big sticks, like broomsticks, and just strapping\nus, \u201cSchnell!\u201d \u201cGet off the train.\u201d So we got off. Everybody was holding up because it was like\nbedlam. If there's such a thing as hell, it's the only picture | could think of. This must be it. We\nwere surrounded with flood lights. Like | say, it was at night. And all of a sudden we had\nguards with the rifles, finger on the trigger, Surrounding us.\nUntil this day | don't understand why they needed it. Because,\nnumber one, Auschwitz was surrounded, every section of the camp, barbed wire, electric\nbarbed wire. So you couldn't go anyplace. Besides, we were scared out of our wits. But still\nthey had guards with nasty police dogs, really nasty dogs. Everybody was holding out to their\nchildren and family trying to stick together.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection |\nAs soon as we got off, they separated men from the women.\nAnd then we had to go through -- there was an officer standing with shiny boots, sharp\nuniforms just like you see in the movies. The one thing, they were always sharp looking. As\nyou passed through, would go like this or like this. The left would go to the gas chamber. The\nright would go to work. Very simple. That means that -- | was, believe it or not, actually\nyoungest from my whole town that came back. There were four or five other boys. They were\nactually a year older, technically. Somehow we always felt we were the same age. And the\nonly reason | think | survived, because | was not that big, we knew they were going to ask to\nwork. | put on about two or three jackets so when | passed through, | looked bigger. And |\nthink -- because most of my friends -- not most, all of them cremated in Auschwitz the first\nnight out. But like | say, the other four were about my size, too. We survived. So it just shows\nyou they had lots of people to pick from. They didn't want too young because they wanted you\nto work in hard labor.\nLuckily, hindsight -- oh, they separated us. | went through the\nline and | passed. So | went with my brother and my father, a couple of uncles. We were on\none side. All of a sudden my brother was separated. He was a good, strong, healthy guy.\nThat's the one that never came back. In the meantime, while we were standing there, there\nwas a little space between us and the group of women like from here to that wall over there, a\nvery small space. But it was empty. And | noticed my mother and my younger sisters. So |\nsaid to my mother -- to my father: \u201cYou know something? I'm going to dash across that space\nand join them because I'll be able to get food or whatever.\u201d My sisters were too young to be\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\nable to do that. So my father says ok. So | tried to make a dash across the space. And this\nfellow, one of the fellows with the uniform, the stick | mentioned -- | found out later he was\ncalled a Kapo and he was doing the work, what the Germans asked him to do, to get people\nmoving. He just grabbed a hold of me, like the back of my neck, and threw me back. \"You\ncan't go there!\" Very mean and nasty. | found out he was another prisoner. Said to my father,\n\u201cCan you imagine, another prisoner so nasty?\u201d\nWell, guess what. Next morning | found out what he did. He\nliterally saved my life. Had | gone, | would have stayed in Auschwitz that night. At that rate, |\ndidn't notice, of course, at the time, but the next thing we went into a shower. They took away\nall of our clothes. They shaved everybody's body hair off, all the hair, especially older people.\nWe came out on the other side. They gave us those striped clothes. Now we became real\nAuschwitz prisoners. They marched us up to a barrack, not far, a few hundred yards from\nwhere we were. We came to the barracks. It was like dawn. It was miserably cold. Mind you,\nthis was the end of May, | think. It was cold, miserable, rainy, so much so it went right through\nyou. And those clothes that they gave us were like pajamas literally. They took away our\nshoes. They gave us wooden shoes.\nAnyway, we came to our barracks. Not far away, a few hundred\nyards away, there was a big, big fire under the pine trees. Actually, they have a picture of it up\nin the museum in one of the places. And the flames were like a long flame, like you see in\nArizona, these fires going through. It was similar to that. Buta long strip of fire, the flames\ngoing up. So we were informed by other prisoners, \u201cthose are your families.\u201d The\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,\ncrematoriums -- by the way, we also found out there were crematoriums. We never heard of\nthe word crematorium. It didn't exist. So they had these big chimneys with black smoke. And\nthe funny thing, you could actually smell the flesh burning, the soot was just falling down, the\nashes, just falling down. It was so cold, and this fire, somebody told us, the crematoriums\ncouldn't handle the volume so they were burning them in pits on a daily fashion -- | mean, a\ndaily basis.\nThis went on constantly. And then later on, because I've\nresearched here in the museum, | found out that they were so meticulous about what they did,\nthey even figured out how many bodies they could burn in 24 hours, counted the bodies, the\nflammable fluids they were using. Mind you, they had everything researched and done\nmethodically.\nUntil this day, | could never understand that another nation was\ncapable of doing this. And this is very important to know. One of the reasons, it shows you in\nthis world, just when you think you are safe, modern, better. You have to be very careful it\nshouldn't happen again. And this is a lesson learned.\n>> Gretchen Skidmore: You were there for 10 days?\n>> Martin Weiss: Yeah. A very short time. | could tell you a lot more about it, but for the sake\nof time I'll go ahead.\nAnyway, One day we got orders to go on a transport. They put\nus on a train. We went westward this time. The reason we knew -- otherwise we wouldn't\nhave known, but the reason we knew where we were going is because we came on a deluge\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nand saw Vienna not far off. Even as a kid | recognized it had to be Vienna, from pictures,\nwhatever. We continued on farther. We came alongside this big, huge mountain. The train\nstopped. We disembarked. They had us march up to the top of the mountain. Like | say, a\nbig mountain.\nIn the meantime, we were scared out of our wits. I'll tell you\nwhy. Every single time the train stopped, something happened. You figured, this is where\nthey're going to kill us. We heard so much of the killing. Then your brain works funny ways. |\nremember thinking that way. Then we figured, well, if they wanted to do that they could have\ndone it there. Why would they bring us here? You argue with yourself.\nAnyway, we came out at the top of the mountain, Mauthausen.\nIt turned out Mauthausen was built on a stone quarry. That's very important why | say this. All\nthe walls of Mauthausen were like from Henry V or something, the old castles, the big thick,\nstone walls. They were mining the stone. The prisoners would bring them up. And they would\nbuild this huge fortress of a camp. Mauthausen was also very similar to Auschwitz, very, very\nbig, very big. They didn't gas people like they did in Auschwitz, on that level, but nevertheless\nthey had gas chambers. If they were weak or whatever, they would send them to the gas\nchamber.\nThey also had -- Mauthausen, like | said, it was a huge camp.\nBut they had a lot of sub camps. For a long time, | Knew it even from the Museum, there were\n40 sub camps. It turned out because of more research, they were up to about 80. Up until\nvery recently they told me they had only 40.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection -e\nAnyway, again, | could tell you the story but for the sake of time\nI'm going to move. They shipped us to one of the sub camps. The camp | went to was Melk.\nSome other people went someplace else.\nNow, at that time they had a lot of prisoners from Hungary\nespecially. The Hungarian contingent was, like | say, all done in a very short time. So a lot of\nthe new prisoners of Mauthausen were Hungarian. What happened is, Mauthausen was also\na mixed camp. So far | was talking about Jews, ok? | want you to understand the camps were\nfilled with non-Jews as well as Jews. There were Germans. There were Pols, lots of Polish,\nlots of Ukrainian, Russian POWs. They were not supposed to be there. There were lots of\nGreeks, Italians. Ok? Until this day, | don't know. They may have been Jewish, but | don't\nknow because we couldn't speak to each other. So all the time we were there, we had no\nidea. | don't know if they were Jewish or not. Many of them may have been. Nevertheless,\nthere were a lot from different countries.\nNeedless to say, the guards -- and this is something that | must\nemphasize. It always bothered me. Most of the people that | experienced, whenever | was,\nthey not only did the dirty job, but they were enjoying it. | can't explain it. You could see it on\ntheir faces. You would think most of these people had families, children, or something. And\nsomehow they really enjoyed their work. Ok? And this is something that bothers the heck out\nof me. In fact, I'm going to get you sidetracked a little bit.\nThe Museum does a lot of research. And not long ago they\nfound a film that somebody took -- they were not supposed to from Auschwitz, from the SS.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection g\nThey were doing the work, killing people every day, every day, smelled that stink of burning\nflesh. They would go home, have the fanciest china they obviously took away from the Jews,\nwith nice carafe of wine. They would have a nice dinner. Their children nicely dressed, with\nthe short pants, Wagner playing. The same person would be a loving father, whatever,\nhusband, but he was killing thousands of children that day. Ok? This is something -- | saw\nthat film. | could not believe it. This is how they separated themselves. They didn't look at us\nas people. They didn't call us people. They called us gefangene, which is a special name for\na prisoner.\n>> Gretchen Skidmore: How did that viewpoint that they had, how did that translate to the\nconditions you lived under at Melk? What was it like there?\n>> Martin Weiss: Ok. I'll give you a little illustration. That's a good point. The working camp\nwas very simple. We worked like three shifts. It depends on when you went to work. If you\nwent to work 5:00 in the morning, you came home about 2:00, 3:00, in the afternoon. And you\nworked hard. We worked building tunnels. So it was all hard labor, picks and shovels. We\nhad to dig the tunnels. Unlike today. Used dynamite and stuff to blast, but otherwise we had\nto do shovel the limestone and everything by hand. A conveyor belt would take some of the\nsand out. But we had to mix the cement, you know, concrete, gravel for -- what do you call it --\n>> Gretchen Skidmore: The wall. It was a tunnel, right?\n>> Martin Weiss: It was a tunnel. They had platforms. You had to take the heavy pails, move\nthem up. Shovel the concrete for the next level and so on. It was very hard to do. Then we\nworked with the jackhammers. | was like 15 years old. | was not that big. Plus we didn't eat.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 0\nWe were starving. Sometimes we had to do this. Not like today, aluminum, they had stainless\nsteel so they were very heavy, above your head, and drill for 10 hours. Just picture.\nSo these things -- so people were dying. The death rate, just to\ngive you an example, the camp | was in was 12,000 or so people in the camp. And every\nsingle month they had replaced -- 3,000 people died. They replaced them with 3,000 new\nones that gives you an idea of what the death rate was.\n| read an article about that, too. They had it figured out. They\nwanted to get rid of everybody. But they wanted some labor out of you first. So they had it\nfigured out that an inmate will only last like two, three years, whatever. | don't remember the\nexact time. But it was a very short timeframe of your life that you would succumb. And this is\nthe way they had it figured. Now they're able to get the work out of you, but they would also kill\nyou at the same time.\nAnd as far as food, they would give us in the morning -- this is\nwhen times were good -- a chunk of bread, which was mostly sawdust. | mean literally. Anda\ncup of -- it was like a broth from sugar beads that you use for cattle. So that was like a tea.\nThat was for breakfast. At noon they would bring out to the field, wherever you worked, they\nwould have like garbage can, like kettles, they would bring it out. It was called\nVerarbeitungserzeugnissen. It was a horrible, horrible-tasting, dehydrated vegetables, stew, or\nwhatever you want to call it. It was so horrid. The smell was so offensive. | remember you\ncouldn't even pass the smell to eat it. But guess what? We ate it. Ok?\n| remember, | was smarter than some people. Some people ate\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .,\nthe bread at one time. | would sort of save a piece of it for later in the day. And that was very\nsmart, hindsight.\nBut anyway, this was the good times. We didn't know it was the\ngood times. Because later on it got worst. By the way, conditions, again, were so brutal. And\nevery single thing that they were able to make worse for you they would do. To give\nillustration, we worked with cement; we had cement bags. During the winter, you had to stand\non a platform to wait for a train that was high up on the field. So the wind was blowing right\nthrough you. The clothes were pajamas. They were not even clothes. We could not get close\nto each other. We had to stand at attention. So some men would take those bags and put\nthem under their jacket, under their shirt, even though they were full of cement, and they would\nitch and all of that. But to act like a wind breaker.\nAnd you wouldn't believe it. | remember coming back from the\nmidnight shift, like about 1:00, 2:00 in the morning. Whether going out from the camp or leave\nthe camp, they would count us not once but five, six times each way to make sure nobody was\nmissing. They were very careful about that. Anyway, sometimes the Lager coming down, the\nbig shot, he would come and 1:00, 2:00 in the morning stand at the gate, have the guards\ncheck, random check people that had these bags. And guess what he would do. Give them\n25 lashes. Ok? He wouldn't do it. He would have a special trained group. Somehow they\nwere Spaniards. Don't ask me why. They were the only ones who had a very good life. They\nhad tailor made -- same prisoner uniforms we had, but they were tailor-made, pressed, sharp.\nThey had a nice hat. They looked like they came out of a movie, like out of a picture. They\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nwere trained to do nothing but give these lashes. Well, | don't have to tell you, when they got\nfinished with us, man, believe me, it wasn't [Inaudible] of this world. This is just one of the\nthings -- somehow you ask yourself what kind of people were they? This is what happened.\nAnyway, I'll jump ahead for the sake of time. Next we went to\nthe Russians -- the Russians and the Americans were closing in from all sides. We were\nevacuated back to Mauthausen.\nAnd by the way, in Melk, like | say, it was people of all different\nnationalities, like | say, from every country. Ok? And we were all treated the same basically.\nWe all lived and died the same way. But they took us back to Mauthausen. We came to\nMauthausen. This time they took us -- they came in to the main camp and they separated out\nall the Jews, separate. They put us on the side of the mountain which was like a neglected\narea, thorny bushes and stuff like that you couldn't even find a place to sit down. At that time\nwe were really, really like zombies. It was just plain starved. Then we realized the reason they\nseparated us -- why would they do that? Obviously they want to kill us. They're not going to\nkill everybody, but they're going to kill us. So we were resigned to that. But by that time you\nwere so out of it, that it didn't matter. You knew you were going to die anyway.\nLo and behold, after we were there a short time -- | don't\nremember exactly how long. We got the orders we were going on a march. Later on they\ncoined it the forced march. This happened at almost every camp people were in. Wherever\nthey were, they marched them someplace else and usually westward. Why? Believe it or not,\nthe soldiers were afraid to be captured by the Russians so they moved everybody westward so\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 3\nthey were captured by the Americans or the English.\nAnyway, we went on a forced march. Somebody fell down.\nThey would just shoot them there just like a dog. In fact, on the march, just to give you one\nlittle incident, | remember we were going on a country road. There was a potato on the\nground. This fellow saw the potato. He leaped for it. Another guy saw the same potato. He\njumped for it as well. Well, guess what. They started fighting over the potato. And one of the\nguards -- by the way, they were not SS. These were regular Army. They were supposed to be\nthe good guys. Ok? | hate to see the bad guys. Just took out his rifle and shot the guy right in\nthe face, in the front. I'm not going to give you the details. You see this. Another guy -- we\nwere going on a country road. There was Alpha or something growing. It was just a matter of\njumping off like from here to there. You know, handful of it. The guards saw him. He shot him\nright there because he went out of line.\nWe reached a place called Gunskirchen after a few days. We\ncame to Gunskirchen. And by now we were really -- | say each time really, but, you know, we\nwere really, really -- some of us were barely alive. But as luck would have it -- and it shows\nyou | was lucky, in many ways. As soon as | came to Gunskirchen -- by the way, this was a\nfairly new camp. It was also in a pine forest. There was a lot of water, puddles on the ground.\nWhen | got there, who do -- oh. While | was in Melk, | was with a cousin of mine. The same\nbarrack. When we were evacuated, he went to a different place and | went to a different place.\n| came to this camp, to Gunskirchen, and who do you think | run into but his brother. He was a\nHungarian labor battalion. The Hungarians were losing. They took a lot of those people and\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection va\nbrought them into Austria. They didn't know what to do with them. They didn't want to let them\nloose so they brought them in and put them into this camp. And when | came there, | run into\nthis cousin of mine. He was about 20, 23 years old. He had about two -- a couple of friends\nhis age. They were in fairly good shape yet. They had their own clothes, boots. They were,\ncompared to us, terrific. But because of him, it helped me. All of a sudden | had somebody to\nlean on if you will. It just shows you how God works in mysterious ways. | left his brother, out\nof 13,000 population, | run into him as soon as | got there.\nAnd by the way, the camp had only a few barracks. At night\neverybody had to go -- during the day, we had to stay outside no matter the weather. At night\nyou had to go in the barracks. 5,000 men in a barrack. Can you imagine? Like an Army\nbarrack, 5,000 people. The only way you were able to stand, like sardines pressed, but\nstanding rather than laying. And | was younger than most, so | whittled down, would spend my\nnight just crouched down. So | did better than some people. In the morning, there were a\nbunch of bodies always. You had to take them.\nAnd here things were so bad already; even that bread was not\nbread. The bread was -- when they tried to give you a piece of bread if you were in line earlier,\nthey couldn't cut it. It was a little crumble. The problem is, you held out your hand like this.\nThe problem was, when you looked at it, it was full of mildew, blue and white, big chunks of\nmildew. And guess what? You ate it. And like | say, | can't emphasize how bad things were.\nBy that time, none of us expected to come out alive. You knew they were going to shoot us\nbefore. We just knew they were not going to let us go.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\nSo what happened, there were puddles of water. Some men\nwould inadvertently walk into this puddle. It would be almost like walking blind. They would\nfall down. | remember them reaching out like this for help. You Know something? You didn't\nbother helping them. Not because we were mean or we didn't care, but we figured he's\nalready that far gone, let him die, he'll be out of his misery. We thought we were doing him a\nfavor because they were that far gone.\nAnd back to the shooting part. All of a sudden one day we\nnoticed the guards were gone, but they were not gone. There were some guards, but they\nwere different guards. So we heard the Americans are here, so it seems that one of the\nofficers that was left behind, to watch over us, the captain went to work. He took a couple of\nelders from the camp. He went out to meet the Americans. We found that out later. | didn't\nknow it at the time. When he met the Americans, he told them, look, | have written orders to\nkill everybody but | chose not to. Ok? So you see, our imagination wasn't exactly wrong.\nSo he actually -- then we found out we were liberated. So a lot\nof people were leaving the camp. We heard of the different incidents that happened before\nthat they would make believe you could go and then kill you outside with machine guns. So\nwe decided to stay an extra night. We were afraid to leave. So the next day we finally left the\ncamp.\nFirst thing we were doing is looked for food. | could go into\nmore detail, but I'll jump for the sake of time. We went -- we came to a field. We saw this truck\nin a ditch. It was like in a field. We looked inside the cab. There was a big tub of lard, a big\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\nbasin. And one of the guys -- like | say, they were in good shape. He took his fist, went right\nthrough the glass. All the glass went into the lard. But we wanted the lard because it has\nsomething to do with food. So we went on the grass, scooped out the glass with the lard,\nthrew it away but saved the lard. Then we went to the back of the truck and got really excited.\nWe found a bunch of hides, refined, ready to use. We got really, really excited. Oh, we're\ngoing to take it to a shoemaker. Believe it or not, shoemakers knew how to make shoes from\nscratch. Ok? So we figured we will need shoes. Not going to find shoes. So each of us gota\nbunch of hides. We couldn't carry much, whatever. Whatever we could carry, we rolled them\nup. We kept on -- we saw a farmhouse not far away. So we came to the farmhouse.\nYou have to remember, if there was such a thing as hate -- |\nspeak for myself, but we had hate. After all, the Germans did this to us. We hated. | mean\nthere was no such thing as a good German. Every German was a Nazi and every Nazi was a\nGerman to us at the time. Just that simple. Nothing complicated. And guess what. Instead of\nbehaving like brutes -- and to be honest, | started speaking here, for years | forgot about this\nstory. Now | like to include it. About three, four years after | started speaking | sort of\nremembered it. | came to the farmhouse. And guess what we did. There was a lady in the\nhouse. She was obviously home alone. We knocked on her door. She opened the door a\ncrack. She asked us what we wanted. One of the fellows asks her for flour, eggs, and water.\nShe went back in the kitchen and brought it to the door. We went -- never went in the house.\nNever pushed in. One of the guys mixed it all up. She had a barn. There was one of those\nkettles like you see in the movies the cowboys used to use, heat up water, iron kettle, put\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\nwood underneath, make a fire and heat it up. So we went to the barn, made a fire. We made\nour first meal of dumplings. We had the ingredients. We had the eggs, lard. It was our first\nmeal. After we were really satisfied with ourselves. The first time we had food. | mean really.\nYet we had a certain instinct not to overdo it. One fellow overrate and he died a day or two\nlater, so it just shows you. We were so delicate we could not tolerate any food.\nAfter it was all over, we ate. One of the fellows suggested: you\nknow something? Each one of us should take a couple of the leather hides and give it to the\nlady. And you know? We did exactly that. Nobody questioned it, anything. Took it over and\nsaid thank you and walked away.\nThat bothered me. Why were we so nice? Like | say, for years |\nforgot about that all together. Until this day | could never understand that despite -- we didn't\nfeel like human beings. Take my word for it. Anything we felt like, definitely didn't look or act\nlike a human being, yet we behaved like a human being. This is why | always like to include\nthis towards the end because our upbringing was such that even though we were different,\nfrom different families, that we had a certain value system. Not one of us questions. The\nGermans, why give hides? They were untitled to it; go into the kitchen and ransack the whole\nplace if we wanted. Ok? We didn't do it. We didn't even step into the house. And this is\nsomething | could never, never understand. Yet if somebody would have said here's a gun,\nshoot this guy, he's German, | don't know if | would have done it but | felt like | could. Ok?\nIt just shows you how differently we behaved. In spite of our\npredicament, how we were, we still behaved -- to put it simply, | discovered one thing. We\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\nwere human after all.\nI'll stop right there.\n>> Gretchen Skidmore: So Marty, we have been actually so blessed and so honored to have\nyou tell about your experiences, to tell about your insights today. We are at the end of the\nprogram, although Marty will be around to talk with people and to say hello afterwards.\n| will thank everybody for coming and let you know that he's\ngoing to be outside in the lobby afterwards, also signing some books.\nSo | think, Marty, it would be good if we make sure -- I'll turn\nback to you one last time to see if there's anything that you would like to say to close the\nprogram. It's our tradition at First Person that our First Person has the last word.\n>> Martin Weiss: | haven't thought about this. | would like to close one thing. We have a lot of\nyoung people here. The only thing, when | speak in front of young people, | always tell them\none thing, that each one of them is important. No matter how much somebody belittles you,\ndon't believe it. You have the right the same as somebody else does. We have to always look\nout for our next door; if it's a school, a bully pushes somebody around, you can't allow them to\ndo that. You have to stand up for them. Sooner or later your turn will come. And if we protect\neach other, we have less to worry about it. | think especially for young people that's a good\nthing to Know.\nAnd with all the stink | hear every so often, bullying in school\nand stuff, it's very important to know that a bully will pick whoever is the weakest or next to\nhim. And if you let him do it, he'll just Keep on doing it to somebody else. The same thing with\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection +0\ngrownups; if you're pushed around, if you let yourself be pushed. You should not allow it,\nwhether it's you or for your neighbor. If you protect each other, we have a right to call\nourselves civilized. That's the only thing | could say.\n>> Gretchen Skidmore: Thank you so much, Marty. Thank you.\n[Applause]\n[The presentation ended at 2:00 p.m.]|\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n",
