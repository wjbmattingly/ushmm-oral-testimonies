My name is Bill Benson. | am the host of the museum's public program First\nPerson. Thank you for joining us. We are in our 14th year of First Person. Our First Person\ntoday is Mr. Bob Behr whom we shall meet shortly.\nThis 2013 season of First Person is made possible through the\ngenerosity of the Louis Franklin Smith Foundation to whom we are grateful for again\nsponsoring First Person.\nFirst Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of\nthe Holocaust who share with us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the\nHolocaust. Each of our First Person guests serves as a volunteer here at this museum. Our\nprogram will continue through mid-August. The Museum's website, www.ushmm.org, provides\ninformation about each of our upcoming First Person guests.\nBob Behr will share with us his First Person account of his\nexperience during the Holocaust and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. If we have time\ntowards the end of our program, we'll have an opportunity for you to ask Bob a few questions.\nThe life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about to hear\nfrom Bob is one individual's account of the Holocaust. We have prepared a brief slide\npresentation to help with his introduction.\nBob Behr was born in Germany, which is highlighted on this\nmap, March 1, 1922. He celebrated his 91st birthday this past March. He lived his first 20\nyears Of his life in the city of Berlin, which is circled on this map of Germany. In 1942, Bob was\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\narrested because he was Jewish and sent to Czechoslovakia. He was interned with\nthousands of other Jews in Theresienstadt also called Terezin. The arrow on this map of\nCzechoslovakia points to Theresienstadt.\nLater in 1944, Bob was sent to a satellite camp where he\nworked to rebuild the SS general headquarters destroyed by the allies. By 1945 the red Army\nreached Theresienstadt and Bob was liberated on May 5, 1945.\nToday Bob and his wife, Marie Therese, live in the Washington,\nD.C. area. After serving with the U.S. Army from 1947 to 1952, Bob worked here in\nWashington, D.C. until he went to work for the U.S. Air Force as an intelligence officer, living in\nGermany from 1954 to 1961. Bob continued his civilian career with the Air Force at\nWright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio until his retirement in 1988. After leaving the Air\nForce, Bob, who had earned a Master's degree in modern European history, was a college\nprofessor teaching European history with a special emphasis on World War Il and the\nHolocaust.\nIn 2000, Bob and Marie Therese moved here to be close to their\ndaughter, Deborah, in Rockville, which is just outside of Washington. They have two\ndaughters and four grandchildren. Besides Bob's passion for history, he stays in shape by\nwalking three miles daily.\nBob is a volunteer at the museum's Visitors\u2019 Service. In\naddition, he is frequently called upon to use his fluency in German and French to translate\ndocuments, and mostly he translates documents that had been captured from the Germans.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ;\nYou will find him here on Friday afternoons.\nWith that I'd like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First\nPerson, Mr. Bob Behr.\n[Applause]\n>> Bill Benson: Bob, welcome and thank you so much for your willingness to be with us today\nas our First Person. | had a number of times the opportunity to talk with you. | know that if we\nhad the time, we could spend all afternoon and beyond with as much as you have to share\nwith us. But we have an hour, so we'll try to get through as much of what Bob has to tell us in\nthat time.\nBob, let's begin today with you telling us about your early years,\nwhat those years were like that preceded Kristallnacht or Night of the Broken Glass.\n>> Bob Behr: Well, you can actually break this down into two distinct dates. As all of you\nknow, I'm sure you do, Hitler came to power on the 30th of January 1933. That means | was\nalready 11 years old. So you have a period that before Hitler and then after Hitler came to\npower. And that is, of course, a tremendous amount of difference.\n| was a kid. | grew up -- my first memory of the Holocaust was\nmy father. My father was like the kids today. The kids today, in my house anyway, the TV\ngoes whether anybody watches or not, but it goes. And so my father in those days listened to\nthe radio day in, day out. He was an MD; so when he was not dealing with patients, he\nlistened to the radio.\nWhy | do mention this? Because my first memory of the\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nHolocaust, | heard a guy screaming over the radio about Jewish conspiracy. Jews had caused\nthe loss of World War I. So what do you think when you're a kid and you hear things and don't\nunderstand it? | was always close to my mother. | went to my mother and said, \"Mom, what\nthe hell is the Jewish conspiracy?\" And my mother said, \"Don't worry about it. It's not\nsomething you have to worry about. If your father wants to listen to this, let him. You don't\nworry. We live in a free country. We live in a democracy. You have nothing to worry about.\"\nSo what do you do? \"When you hear this, you don't worry.\" So | didn't.\nAnd then suddenly on one day, ladies and gentlemen, on one\nmiserable, lousy day, the 30th of January 1933, everything changed. Hitler became chancellor\nof Germany. Hitler became the most powerful person in the German republic which was\nheretofore a democracy. And everything else faded. So my life from one day to the next\nchanged. The people who were yelling about Jewish conspiracy, and the Jews are misgivings,\nthose people now were in power, could implement all the threats they had made against Jews.\nNow they could do it.\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, in answer to his question, what was\nit before, it radically changed. | will have a hard time describing to you in the time | have how\nlife changed in the city of Berlin.\nHow many of you have been to Berlin? | want some hands.\nHigh. Quite a few. It's now a beautiful city. It was not a beautiful city then. But it was our\nhome. And suddenly in this city which we used to like and which we grew up in, resented us,\ndisliked us, persecuted us. How did that manifest itself? Signs all over the place. \"Jews not\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nallowed.\" \"Jews not wanted.\" \"Jews not admitted here.\" It was going on and on.\nThe Nazis are masters of propaganda. And the propaganda\nwas raining on the German people, including the city of Berlin. And every day there was\nsomething bad about Jews. | could spend hours with you and give you examples, but\nunfortunately | don't have that much time. Just think about your hometown, wherever you are\nfrom, and the things you like to do: play ball, go to a movie, go to a restaurant. Can't do\nanything anymore. That's the way it was with us.\nMy favorite sport was swimming. | loved to swim. So when you\nswim, you need two things, right? You need a pool and you need water. And what the\nGermans did, they integrated the third element, a pool, water, and a big sign, \"Jews not\nallowed here.\" We don't want Jews in the swimming pool. And so the screws were getting\ntighter and tighter. It became a city in which instead of loving it, we feared it. We were afraid.\nIt dribbled on us every day. | mean, the Nazis were determined to eradicate Jewish life.\nBefore | go to the next question, | want to explain one thing to\nyou. And I'm going to be quite honest. If | hurt your feelings, forgive me. | was born Jewish.\nMy parents were Jewish. But that was a name on a piece of paper only. What we really were,\nmy parents especially -- | never had any brothers and sisters. My mother took one look at me\nwhen | was born and said enough is enough, and we're not going to have another child looking\nlike him. So that was the end of that one.\nIn any case, my parents were German. My father was an officer\nin World War I, decorated with the Iron Cross, First Class, and was enormously proud of it.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nWe were Germans when we were Jewish. Keep this in mind. It hurts you because the very\npeople to whom you want to belong says we don't want you. You can be a Jew, that's fine.\nBut we don't want you.\nIn 1934, in September, the Nazis had a big rally. Remember, in\n1933 they assumed power. A year later they had that rally. They took over our citizenship.\nFrom one moment to the next we were no longer German citizens. We were residents. They\ndidn't kick us out. We were a resident, meaning we were allowed to stay there. But we could\nnot participate in German life anymore. We were not allowed.\nIt goes all across the board. My father was a doctor. He was no\nlonger allowed to treat German patients. He was no longer allowed to collect money from\nSocial Security -- from the insurance companies. It was going on. So you get the idea of what\nlife was like. And what that does, it makes you afraid.\nNow, you can think, how did they know that you were a Jew?\nGood question. First of all, which most of you guys may not know, a German birth certificate\nhas a line item in it which says religion. It was mandatory to be filled out. So the Germans had\niton a silver platter. They knew exactly who were Jewish, who were not. So it became a life\nof anxiety. It became a life of fear.\nI'm being very honest with you. We were afraid because the\npunishment was drastic every time you did something wrong, including crossing the street! Ifa\nGerman crossed the street the wrong way, you got a warning. If we did and they found out\nyou were a Jew, they beat you up for it. Could you do something about it? Not really. You\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\ncould try to get out, which wasn't easy. While President Roosevelt wasn't exactly helpful to get\nout.\nSo | am hoping in the time that | have to give you a picture of an\nidea what life was like from complete freedom to total oppression in everyday life.\n>> Bill Benson: Bob, before we turn to Kristallnacht in November of 1938, you were sent to\nboarding school in Sweden. Tell us a little bit about that. Why?\n>> Bob Behr: Ok. Number one, the bad news. My parents got divorced. | stayed with my\nmother. And my mother was a person who accomplished things which almost hard -- you'll\nsee later on what she did. But right now the question, she found out there was a boarding\nschool in Sweden.\nNow, for those of you who are very good in geography, let me\njust tell you, Sweden was a neutral country, nothing to do with anti-Semitism, a free country. It\nhad good money. It had good people. And what | mean by good money is valuable money.\nMoney is judged by the ability to exchange it into other currency.\nSo my mother found out that there was a boarding school. And\nlo and behold, | told you before that woman was amazing, she accomplished things, she got\nme enrolled. There were about 40 of us, all German-Jewish kids, and we were admitted to the\nschool. Suddenly we were out of Germany. It was 1936, 1937. We were in a free country,\ncould say what we wanted, could do what we wanted, as long as it was within the law. No\nmore Nazis, no more chicanery, no more hatred, nothing.\nSo end of story? No! Because as far as this is concerned, it\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,\nlasted six months. When my mother, six months later, went to the bank and said, \"I need to\nexchange\u2019-- | don't remember, 300 marks into Swedish currency, the clerk says, \u201cNo more.\nWe do not exchange money anymore for tuition purposes. We have other problems and no\nmoney.\u201d\nSo what happened to the school? It closed. Six months later\nwe were called together and told that the school was closed. But, the Director said, \"| got good\nnews for you. We found Swedish families who are willing to take you in.\" There were 40 of us.\n\u201cYou can stay in Sweden. You don't have to go back to Germany. All we need from you is a\nletter from your parents that they have no objections if you stay here.\u201d As far as | know, 38\npeople, parents, happily signed it, affidavit, that their kids could stay in Sweden and two didn't.\nI'll give you about five seconds to think who the second was. But my mother, the energetic,\nwonderful woman, says, \u201cYou're coming home. | don't want you to stay here. | need you to\ncome home.\u201d\nBehind the statement, the long story which | don't want to bother\nyou because I'm from a pretty dysfunctional family -- well, it's true. You may say | am too, but\nyou don't really know that yet. Give me a chance. By the time | am finished, you may say he's\ndysfunctional, too. In any case, | had to come back and that was the end of that Swedish\nadventure.\n>> Bill Benson: November 10, 1938, was the night of what's known as Kristallnacht or Night of\nthe Broken Glass. On that night vicious attacks took place against Jews, their businesses,\ntheir homes, all over Germany. You were 16 at that time. Hundreds of synagogues were\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0\nburned. You were 16. How did that personally affect you and your family?\n>> Bob Behr: Well, in a way, psychologically it did, physically it didn't. | don't Know if you all\nknow the background of Kristallnacht or what happened. | don't have an opportunity to go into\nthe thing. But, | remember that my mother told me she received a phone call from somebody.\n| have no idea who. And that person told my mother don't let your son get out of the house\ntomorrow, which was the night, 8th or 9th of November, 1938. And she didn't. For what we\ndid not experience was any physical harm to come. Was there physical harm? You bet ya\nthere was. Not only did they set the synagogues on fire, they took the Jewish holy scripture\nand threw them on the floor and made the Germans walk across it. | told you before, we were\nnot very Jewish, but that's above and beyond the call of righteousness.\nSo my biological father was arrested. 40,000 Jews were\narrested in Berlin alone, eeny, meeny, miny, moe, up to the concentration camps. All in\nrevenge for the assassination in Paris. So Kristallnacht hurt us very much.\nMy father was in a concentration camp. The only way you could\nget out is from the concentration camp, on a ship, and off someplace, another country. | never\nsaw him again. And that was it. He did get out. | found that out. He made his way to\nAmerica and died here in the time after liberation in 1945. When | finally made it to America,\nwhile | was on the ship, he died. So | literally never saw him again after he was arrested on\nKristallnacht.\nLife after this was terrible. There are things which most people\ndon't even know. After the assassination in Paris, the burning of the synagogues and the\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nlooting, there was additional things. The Germans did two things. Number one, they went to\nthe big insurance companies who had insured the synagogues and the Jewish stores and told\nthese owners of the insurance companies, \u201cYou will pay, you will reimburse the damage,\nbut\u201d -- they added \u2014 \u201cnot to the owner, the Jew. You will give it to the government.\u201d So if there\nwas a 50,000 or 100,000 mark indemnity to be paid, then the Germans took it and the owner\ngot nothing, lost his insurance money in addition.\nFurthermore, and that's where we came in -- we didn't have a\nstore. My father was a doctor. But they levied a fine on us, on the entire Jewish community in\nGermany, of one billion. And, please, that's not a mistake. That's a B, one billion marks which\nthe Jews had to collect and turn over to the government.\nHow many Jews were there? The German population at the\ntime was 65 million people. Jews were 500,000. You do the math. That's not even 10%. But\nthey made us pay. We had to sell my mother's jewelry to even make our quota, to do that. So\nthat gives you a feeling of the German idea of revenge. They took it and we had to hold still\nand take it.\n>> Bill Benson: Bob, you would continue living in Berlin with your mother until 1942 when you\nwere arrested. Tell us a little bit about that time between Kristallnacht, after your mother had\nto sell the jewelry and help pay for the fine and when you were arrested in 1942. During that\nseveral-year window, briefly, what was life like for you then?\n>> Bob Behr: Ok. Remember | told you guys that | came back from Sweden because my\nmother wouldn't sign the letter. And so | came back, and we're now talking about 1937, 19 --\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 5\nearly 1938, before Kristallnacht. The Germans had established a forced labor arrangement.\nThat's not slave labor. | want to be sure. It's not slave labor. Forced labor meant you had to\ngo and work where the Germans want you to work. And you could not, for example, say | don't\nfeel well and so forth.\n| had to go when | came back -- they established a special office\nfor this. For the Berlin Jewish young people and middle-aged people had to go every morning\nand get work assignments. This was our manual labor. It was difficult. For example, | gota\njob carrying coal. They had central heating all over the city, and they had to have coal. So we\nwent on a truck and brought the coal. And then you had to bring it downstairs in the basement\nwhere they had the stove. Or you had to take bricks up on a construction site.\nYou know, ladies and gentlemen, when | look at your faces,\nyou're all too young to remember. But in those days they didn't have all the cranes they have\ntoday. It was manual labor that brought those bricks up there. And that was my job. It was\nvery difficult.\nFurthermore, the office where we had to report to was\napproximately 12 kilometers from where we were. How did you get there? You say street car.\nWe could only allow certain street cars. Never more than two Jews. They wouldn't let us in.\nTo tell you how | got there, that's the way | got there. | went on my bicycle. Rain or shine, |\nbicycled the 12 kilometers down in the morning and the 12 kilometers back. | call myself lucky\nthat | was young enough and strong enough to do all the work which | had to do.\nJust as an aside, after the war, the new government, democratic\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nrepublic, Germany, a rich country, they want to reimburse us for all the suffering we've done.\nThey came up with the enormous and intelligent decision, we're going to give them $5 a day\nfor every day they suffered. | suffered 12 years. Multiply this by 365 days times five marks\nand you think | would get all the money. No. But they taxed that, too. Anyway. So we are not\nthe only ones here who are suffering from taxes. They made us. So that gives you some idea\nhow the time was between our arrests. It was work, work, work.\nLet me just add one thing. We were no longer allowed\nentertainment. We couldn't go to a movie, couldn't go to the theater, couldn't go to the music\nhall, couldn't go dancing. So what do you do? You're 17, 18 years old. You want to live. You\nwant to be young. But you couldn't do it anymore because they wouldn't let you in. So we\nsolved that. We had house parties and well organized. We took our parents and fanned them\nout. Family A, parents go to family B, and the kids from family B come to family A apartment\nand we had house parties. No supervision because we had written off our parents. And I'm\nnot going to give you any details what we did. But | tell you, we compensated a little bit for all\nthe suffering we had there. Well, I'm not going to go into any more details.\n>> Bill Benson: Bob, during that time, what did your mother do?\n>> Bob Behr: My mother didn't do anything. She was a housewife. She never had a job. She\nnever -- she didn't go to the university or do anything. She was just there practically -- my\nmother had one hobby, playing Bridge. And she found four or five people who also loved to\nplay Bridge. They had a little club where they met and played Bridge. But she really was an\nordinary housewife: cleaning, cooking, whatever else belongs, washing and so forth.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection |\n>> Bill Benson: She got remarried somewhere in that time though, didn't she?\n>> Bob Behr: Yeah. Let me see now. That saved our life. In the Bridge playing she was\npopular with another doctor who had the name of Hamburger, the way you eat it but that was\nalso his name. And those two met. | don't know. | wasn't there. | rely on my mother's story.\nHe asked her to marry my mother. And my mother came to me and said, \u201cShould | marry\nhim?\u201d And | said, \u201cYou know, you shouldn't ask me that. | mean, that's a decision you will\nhave to make.\u201d And she said, \u201cWell.\u201d\nAnd then one day he met the three of us. And he repeated his\noffer to marry. And he said something, ladies and gentlemen, that saved my life, otherwise |\nwouldn't be here today. He said, \"Lily, marry me. | ama veteran of World War |. And it's a\ngood possibility that the Nazis will not punish the veterans, the German veterans, of World War\nl.\"\nTo make a long story short, they did marry. And it was true, as\nyou will hear later, that our lives, the life of my father, stepfather, and mother, were saved\nbecause of his service. | hate to speculate what would have happened to us if she had not\nmarried him. | think | wouldn't be sitting here today. You may have had somebody else but\nnot me because we would have been gone to the east and to the gas chambers like they\nstarted in 19471 to kill us.\n>> Bill Benson: At one point during that period you were forced out of your house. You lost\nyour house.\n>> Bob Behr: Yeah. How many of you live in an apartment? | want to see some hands. Ok.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\nYou guys who own a house, just ignore what I'm telling you now, this story. Because we lived\nin an apartment, on the third floor, without an elevator. But that's where we lived for many\nyears.\nIn Berlin -- it's in the western part of Berlin which later on\nbecame the British sector after the war. In 1938, just after Kristallnacht, the Germans passed\nthe law that Jewish renters no longer have protection from being expired or so forth unless\nthey didn't pay the rent. So my mother got a letter. It says, \"Dear Mrs. Behr, the Christian\nresidents of this building have informed us\u201d -- that's the owner -- \"have informed us that they\nno longer wish to live under the same roof as Jews. You are requested to move out as quickly\nas possible but no later than\" -- and gave a date. What do you do with a letter like this? Very\nclever. We tried to ignore it. It will go away. We had paid our rent. We had lived there for\nyears. We liked it. We had never hurt anybody. We had never harmed anybody. So we\nignored it.\nGuess what we did? What we got? We got a second letter. A\nlittle rougher in tone. \"Get the hell out of here, of our building, you Jews. We don't want you\nhere.\" And now they forced us. They forced us. We had to quit. And by that time the Nazis\nhad the law that Jews went someplace else but only with other Jews. Couldn't go to other\nChristian household or apartment building. So that was our thing. We had to move out for no\nother reason that your religion was not acceptable to the Christian people who lived in the\nbuilding.\n>> Bill Benson: Bob, you would continue under those circumstances until July of 1942 when\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,\nyou, your mother, and your stepfather, now, were arrested and you were sent to\nTheresienstadt. Tell us about your arrest and then going to Theresienstadt.\n>> Bob Behr: | would love to tell you about the arrest. Now, just follow me. We start off with a\nlady who my mother knew. | think they went to school together. I'm not even sure. But they\nwere friends, not very close friends, but friends. And that lady came to my mother in July or\nthe end of June 1942 and said to my mother, \"Lily\u201d -- which is my mother's first name \u2014 \u201cI need\nto get out of Germany. | can no longer stand it here. | don't know what's going to happen. |\nam not married. | have no relatives. I'm all alone. | want to get out. Can you help me?\" And\nmy mother, making a long story very short now, my mother knew a priest in the area. If you\never go back to your home and look at a map of Germany, you'll see that Constance is a\nspitting stone from the Swiss border. My mother said, \u201cGo see him. I'll give you his name. |\ncan't help you. You got to work that out yourself. But here is his name and address. Maybe at\nnight he will bring you across the border to Switzerland and you'll be out of Germany and free.\u201d\nSo yes, she got the name. Yes, she met the priest. Yes, he did it. He brought her across the\nborder.\nNow, you think that's a happy end story? Watch. So what does\nthat woman do? She writes a postcard to my mother in Berlin, which, number one is already a\nmistake with the Nazis censoring everything but she writes a postcard and says, \"Lily, guess\nwhere | am? I'm sitting in Bern\u201d -- the capital of Switzerland \u2014 \u201chaving a real cup of coffee,\nenjoying the sunshine.\u201d It was the month of July. And then she writes a P.S., \"Without you, |\nwouldn't be sitting here today.\"\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nNow, | want you to all quickly put your mind, you are now ina\nGestapo office. You censor the mail. You read that postcard. What conclusions do you\ndraw? There's only one, that the woman she is writing the card to is the one who helped her\nget out of Germany, which was punishable. End of story? No. The next day, or two days\nlater, | don't remember that, we were arrested. The Gestapo came, took us in. And that's how\nit started.\nWe were not under the normal evacuation. Because,\nremember, my stepfather was a veteran. So the evacuation to the east, to the gas\nchambers had already started in 1941. We're now talking July of 1942. But we were not sent\nvia -- if it hadn't been for the postcard, | don't know how much longer we could have stayed.\nBut the bottom line is that postcard existed, and the Nazis took appropriate action to arrest us.\nWe were shipped to Theresienstadt rather than sent east and killed.\n>> Bill Benson: Tell us about Theresienstadt, once you got there.\n>> Bob Behr: Ok. Two minutes of background. Those of you who are historians or interested\nin history, there was such a thing as the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy. In 1918, when the\nAustrians lost the war, same as the Germans, the Treaty of Versailles rearranged all of\nEurope. And among other things, this area where Theresienstadt is located became the\nCzech Republic. Before that it was Austria. Austria was gone. The empire. And now the\nCzech owned that. A lot of history involved. | don't want to bore you with it. But in 1939,\nHitler marched into Czechoslovakia and took it over. Czechoslovakia ceased to exist.\nTheresienstadt was a Garrison city under the Czech Republic.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection -e\nSuddenly the Germans moved in. The Czechs had no more Army. So the city, with the\nexception of the civilian dependents who lived there, the city was empty and that they decide\nwe're going to make a concentration camp, build a wall around it. A bus going to Prague two\nor three times a week. You can visit that place. Only about 35, 40 minutes by bus.\nSo the city was empty. And the Germans decided. So they\nwent to the Czech Jews in Prague and say here is your city, you're going to be imprisoned up\nthere. And the Czech ran the camp. The German Jews -- those who they didn't send to the\neast were sent there as well. Mostly old people or special people like ours, veterans.\nNow, let me just give you some idea of the complexity of that\nthing. Very briefly, there were 4,000 dependents living there in little tiny houses, still exist.\nEverything is still there. The Germans kicked those guys out. And now they had an empty\ncity. And in that city where they had 4,000, give or take a few, people living up there which\nwere kicked out, they stuffed 60,000 people. You cannot imagine how miserable life was. It\nwas so overcrowded.\nHow many of you like sometimes in your day or in your weeks a\nmoment of privacy? | want to see your hands. Thank you. That's great. Because that's\nexactly how | felt. Except in Theresienstadt there was no escaping from people. You were\nnever alone! You were never alone. We slept 40 people in one room, no straw, no beds, not\neven a nail on the wall to hang something. It was so overcrowded that people kept dying of\ndiseases.\nMy first job in this miserable place was to carry dead bodies.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection g\nAgain, let me throw out to you that even though | personally didn't have the pleasure to know\nyou, that when you had a death in your family, it was a solemn occasion: a wake, a viewing,\nsomething more appropriate. This was nothing. The people died from diseases, sanitation.\nWe all looked like | don't know what, because the Nazis wanted that we look like something\nfrom daily unrest and so forth.\nSo my first job was to collect dead bodies. | told you. What\ndoes that mean? We had to throw them on a cart. One on the head, one on the shoulders,\none on the feet, shoop, throw them on a cart, preferably naked because the clothing was\nvaluable.\nAnd | will tell you something. After you do this for a while\ninstead of honoring the dead, respecting them, all you care are about how heavy they are and\nhow high you have to throw them. You know what that does to your soul, your equilibrium,\nwhat that does to your mental ability when you become so raw, so disinterested from reality\nthat you don't even think about things like honoring a dead person? Nothing.\nSo life in Theresienstadt was blinded. It did have something\nwhich no other concentration camp had. It had a cultural level. They had musicians up there.\nThey had poets up there. They had artists up there. And the Nazis let them practice before\nthey sent them to the gas chamber. | mean, this is a controversial type camp. The Germans\ncalled it \u201cHitler gave the Jews a city to do what they wanted.\u201d Yeah, that's right. They didn't.\nAnd the other little things, which are not well-known, the city was\nrun by the Czech Jews and run very well. They had a mayor who was a Czech. He was the\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 0\none who was responsible. He was the one who interfaced with the Germans. Why | mention it\nis | have the greatest respect for the Czechs except for one thing. Those guys, being Czechs,\nblamed the German Jews for not having done enough to prevent Hitler coming to power. That,\nof course, in the eternal words of American slang is B.S. because it simply wasn't true. We\ndidn't do anything. We couldn't have done. But the Czechs didn't care. They didn't care.\nThey blamed us for the suffering they did because of Adolph Hitler and the loss of their country\nin March of 1939.\nIn 1943, the Germans realized that they had to empty the camp.\nIt's no longer possible to have these hundreds and hundreds of people in the camp without any\ndecent medical facilities, food, and so forth.\nHow many of you take a shower a day, practically? | want to\nsee those hands. Ok. You're all very clean. Supposing I'm telling you that you cannot take\nany shower anymore, period! How would you feel after a week? I'll give it to you in one word.\nDirty! Believe me. Trust me. You feel dirty. You feel sticky. You feel unhappy with yourself.\nBut that's what they wanted us to be like. That's what they wanted us to be. And we did.\nSo by 1943, they began to empty the camp. They send 1,000\nJews, Czech, German Jews in a cattle car to Auschwitz or Birkenau and killed them. And |\nbecame very worried that my mother and my stepfather would be also -- they called it\nresettlement. Germans are great at finding names. Resettlement sounds innocent enough. |\nmean, this is very simple. You have a big hurricane up here. And then you resettle people\nbecause you have to rebuild the city first. But everybody in the camp knew that resettlement\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .,\nmeant death.\nHow did we know? We had no newspaper, no radio, no nothing.\nHow did the camp know that the word resettlement equates to death? I'll tell you how. Very\nfew German SS people there. Most of the guards who were guarding us were Czech whom\nthe Germans hired to guard the camp. Now, that didn't mean these guys were in love with the\nGermans. But they got something to eat. They got money. They gota job. So they said,\nwhat the hell, I'm going to work for the Germans regardless of how | feel.\nBut the Germans also used those young guards to escort the\ntrains from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz. And, of course, it was Czechs saw the smoke,\nsmelled the air, knew what happens at the ramp when they unloaded the poor people up there\nand made them line up, women here, children here, men over there and so forth. They saw all\nof that. And they didn't take long to figure that out. But they came back to Theresienstadt.\nNot liking the Germans, they told their buddies, the Czech Jews inside, don't you agree to\nresettlement because what that means, here it is. And they told them what they experienced\nwhen they escorted those trains to Auschwitz and smelled the air and saw the fire and so forth.\nSo everybody in the camp knew.\nNow, my own life was this. | was really worried. My mother was\nnot in good health. My stepfather was not in good health. | was wondering what's going to\nhappen. How am | going to protect them? | wasn't so much worried about myself. But | was\nworried about them.\nNow, bear with me. New chapter. The war in 1943 had had\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nreached tremendous portions. Your grandfathers, the Air Force and the British were bombing\nthe hell out of Berlin, day in and day out, at night the British, during the day the Americans.\nThe reason I'm telling you this, because it comes together.\nAmong the buildings they destroyed was the building where the\nSS chief had his headquarters. Shoop, gone. Now, a four-star general got to have a\nheadquarters. You would all agree. My God, the poor guy must have put his head someplace,\nhis troops someplace. So they went to the German Army and said | need a new headquarters.\nWhy am | telling you this? Bear with me. Coming right around\nto it.\nSo, the Germans gave him a piece of land, which is now that\nlittle town of Wulkow which Bill mentioned. And they said this is where | want my\nheadquarters. And the Nazis, who were supposed to build it for him, came to Theresienstadt.\nThey said we need 250 volunteers to go there and build him that headquarters, among them\ncarpenters, plumbers, unskilled labors which | was, and so forth. Then they added a sentence,\nand that's crucial. The sentence is, \"If you volunteer to go there\u201d -- because, among friends\nhere, nobody ever wanted to go to the SS recommended. So nobody volunteered for nothing.\nlf you have good English. So, in any case, they come and said, \"If you will volunteer, we will\nnot,\" quote/unquote, \"resettle your parents, your relatives in the camp.\" And | bought that. |\nsaid if | don't do anything -- so | volunteered.\nAnd now by the end of 1943, | was sent to that area to build that\ncamp. | don't Know how much you want me to talk about that.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 3\n>> Bill Benson: We're starting to get very close to the end. | want to be sure that you tell us a\nlittle bit about that and then, of course, about your liberation and about your parents.\n>> Bob Behr: Ok. Well, I'm going to cut it short. | just want to tell you that in that labor camp\nup there in that sub-camp from Theresienstadt, that, ladies and gentlemen, was the first time\nsince 1933, since January 1933, that | wanted to die. | had always told myself I'm not going to\ngive those SOBs the satisfaction that | will die because | want to live until the world what\nhappened once we're free. But now | gave up.\n| don't have time to go into the hardship of that camp. But it was\nso bad that | got very sick. By 1944, | was very sick. | had something which is a vitamin\ndeficiency disease, which is very ugly because you get big blotches over your body, the\nclothing sticks. You get a high temperature. | said: no more; | can't, time's up. If Igo, | go.\nAnd as | was standing and thinking that, | was one day -- this is\na story. | want you to follow me. | was standing on the barbed wire fence on a Sunday looking\nout. We're now talking about the end of 1944 or it could have been January of 1945. | don't\nremember. And there was another prisoner with me. And what we saw was the following. We\nsaw -- outside the camp was a highway. And on that highway we saw a track of Germans\ngoing from east to west.\nNow, let me explain this to you. All during the war the Germans\nwent from west to east, conquering Poland, Hungary, Russia. Now all of a sudden the same\nGermans went from east to west. | remember asking this guy, \u201cDo you see this?\u201d He said,\n\u201cYeah, of course | see this.\u201d They looked about as miserable outside as we looked miserable\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection va\nin the inside. And | asked him, \"What do you make of this?\" He said, \"It's very simple. The\nGermans are fleeing from the Russians.\" The Russians after Stalingrad, the Battle of\nStalingrad, began to win the war. And by now, by 1943, they had pushed the German Army so\nfar west that the first Russians were entering the easternmost province of Germany which no\nlonger exists. So | figured if the Russians are that close, that the Germans are already fleeing,\nwell, maybe | can hang in a little bit longer. And | did. | survived. And we were returned to\nTheresienstadt. That camp was never finished because the Russian Army came.\nWe were returned. And we arrived there about February of\n1945. My stepfather and my mother were still alive. For once the Nazis had kept their promise\nthat they would not quote/unquote resettle them, and they were alive. And now it was\nFebruary 1945. And on the 5th of May, the Russian Army came and we were free.\n>> Bill Benson: When did you know you were free?\n>> Bob Behr: Well, the guards vanished. The SS guards vanished. They were around all the\ntime. And all of a sudden, shoop. They were never there. They saved themselves where they\nwent. There was sort of a period of no-man's land. The Russians weren't here yet. The\nGermans were already gone. There were only the Czechs who were just as happy that the\nNazis had left. Nobody knew. Who's going to feed us? Who's going to take care of us? |\nmean, the Nazis had everything organized. That organization went to hell in a hand basket\nbecause there wasn't anybody there to enforce it. But it wasn't very long and the Russians\ncame and took over.\nBy the way, those combat troops, the Russians, were very good\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\nto us. They were not raping women and stealing watches. The German word for watches,\nuhr. They would always say, \u201cUhr, uhr, uhr.\u201d They wanted all of our watches. But we didn't\nhave any watches anyway. They later took it when we get to Berlin.\nAnyway, that's how it happened, the liberation.\n>> Bill Benson: Do you remember your sense when you finally said it's over, we're liberated?\n>> Bob Behr: No. Because | don't have any word for that. | cannot other than platitudes to\nsay how happy we were to be free. That is something you need -- there are two moments in\nthis time period. First one was -- it began to sink in that Germany lost the war, the Nazis were\ngone, and we were free. And the second moment of that magnitude is when the ship went\npassed the Statue of Liberty. We cried so hard. We never thought we would experience it.\nAfter 12 years, to be sailing passed the Statue of Liberty into the New York Harbor is a\nmoment you need to experience. Words cannot describe it. | don't care how good you are.\nIt's just not there.\nAnd so it was when we were liberated. Words cannot describe\nit, of things you'd been dreaming about, you were hoping about, you were praying about\nsuddenly are there. | don't have the right words to bring this to you. But I'm sure you\nunderstand.\n>> Bill Benson: Bob, before we close, I'm going to ask you two other things in the little time\nthat we have. One is, with the war over, tell us how your mother and your stepfather were at\nthat point. And then go forward real quickly, you finally pass the Statue of Liberty in\nFebruary 1947. But just a few months later in November you're in the U.S. Army and you're\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\nback in Germany. So tell us about that. That was remarkable.\n>> Bob Behr: What was the first one?\n>> Bill Benson: How your mom and stepfather were.\n>> Bob Behr: They were very weak. Died shortly after the war, both of them. They survived,\ntechnically speaking survived. They went with me to Berlin, which is another story because\nthe Nazis had occupied our apartment. We had to chase the people out. So! got them\nresettled back there. And | went off to America. Well, | wound up in Texas, in Dallas, Texas.\n>> Bill Benson: With $10.\n>> Bob Behr: With $10. Well, let me tell you how | got there. We arrived in New York. We\nwere put up in the hotel. And the next day or two we were interviewed. And what | had done\nin the meantime, the distribution committee, which was a Jewish committee, had surveyed the\nJewish communities all over the United States and said: how many of these refugees can you\ntake? So when my time came to be interviewed, they asked me, \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d\nAdding immediately, \"you cannot stay in New York.\" Yes, sir.\nSo anyway, \u201cWhat options do | have?\u201d And they looked at the\nlist and said, \u201cWell, you can either go to Dallas or you can go to Chicago. Where do you want\nto go?\u201d | didn't have a blasted idea. We were cut off from everything, neither about Chicago\nnor about Dallas. But | figured out: let me see; if | go to Chicago, | got to live with gangsters.\nIf | go to Dallas, | got to live with Cowboys. So that is the lesser of two evils. And guess what?\n| wound up in Dallas, 108-degree heat.\n| don't know how many Texans are here. | don't want to hurt\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\nanybody, too. But you are a caliber of your own.\n[Laughter]\nWhether you came from Europe, and suddenly these guys\u2019 life, 100 miles to a drive-in and\n100 miles back. So think nothing of it. So it was different.\nMy biggest -- first of all, they got me a job. They got me a job in\na ladies leather factory where they made handbags, belts. This is before Velcro. So in those\ndays you had to glue things together. Why am | telling you this? Because in the middle of this\ndamn factory was a kettle with glue which had to be stirred all the time so that the glue\nwouldn't get hard. Guess who did the stirring. So | smelled bad. | hated that job.\nThen | came home and the land lady -- her name was Merrill. I'll\nnever forget that. She could never distinguish the difference between Germany and France\nbecause she kept calling me \"Frenchy.\" So! was Frenchy. | lived there. | said that's really not\nthe life | was hoping for.\nSo her husband, Merrill's husband, worked in the oil fields. They\nonly came home over the weekend. And what did he do? | don't know how to describe it very\nwell. But those houses had a porch around the upper floor. You can go upstairs. That's\nwhere the bedrooms are and so forth. | rented a room up there. One day, shoop. The\nwindow broke. A rifle came pointing at me lying in bed and saying, \u201cYou, SOB, if you don't\nleave my wife alone, I'm going to get even with you.\u201d | had nothing to do with his wife, nothing\nother than she was my landlady and called me Frenchy. So | said the time has come to move.\nSo first of all, after | was finished in that ladies' handbag factory,\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\n| got a job at Walgreens. Everybody here knows of Walgreens. Well, in those days they had\ncounters. And you could have a cup of coffee or breakfast and so forth. The crucial moment\ncame when one of those nice 60-year-old ladies with blue hair came in, sat down at the\ncounter and said -- and | went up there. | said, \"May | help you, ma'am?\" \"Yeah. Give me two\neggs over easy, toast, coffee, and a glass of juice.\" \u201cYes, ma'am.\u201d So | went to the manager.\n\u201cWhat the hell are eggs over easy?\u201d Nobody in Europe ate eggs over easy. They ate them\nsunny side up or they didn't eat any eggs. That was all | knew. So he explained to me what it\nwas and how easy that is. So! served her. She calls me back and says, \"You call that over\neasy?\u201d They were hard as a rock because -- | said that's not for me either. | went to the\nmilitary. | said | got to have a structured life. | got to have something to support my mental\nstate. And | went to the Army. And | said, \u201cTake me. I'm yours.\u201d\n[Laughter]\nAnyway, in those days you didn't have to be a citizen. You\ncould sign a Declaration of Intent, meaning if you signed this, that you would become a citizen\nas soon as you are eligible. And that's called a Declaration of Intent. That was enough for the\nArmy to take me.\n>> Bill Benson: And we're going to close in a moment. You would actually end up back in\nGermany and interrogating former Nazis.\n>> Bob Behr: Yeah.\n>> Bill Benson: As part of the intelligence service. | wish we had the time to spend more time\non everything that Bob has shared with us, that postwar experience in Germany, just very\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection +0\npowerful stuff. We'll just have to have you come back another time when we have Bob with us\nagain.\n>> Bob Behr: Or you can invite me and I'll come to you.\n[Laughter]\n>> Bill Benson: Better yet.\n[Applause]\n>> Bob Behr: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.\n>> Bill Benson: We didn't have time for questions and answers. But Bob is going to stay for a\nlittle while over here. If any of you would like to come and ask him a question, just shake his\nhand, give him a hug, whatever you want to do, please do it.\n>> Bob Behr: Ok.
