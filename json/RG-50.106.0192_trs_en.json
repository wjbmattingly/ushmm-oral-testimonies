            "question": "Karl Marx.",
            "answer": "Karl Marx was based on the fact that his people were called Marcus. And but the Germans made it into Marx and so that\u2019s, so my grandfather was, his family name, last name was Marcus. So that was my connection there. This little town that I mentioned where I was born was actually a center of a lot of Romanian villages who were working the land. And they were raising crops and this town, acted -- there were 400 Jewish people there, mostly merchants who actually brought and bought from other places to give to their customers who were from the villages. So my father had a store with fabrics. In those days there were no ready-made clothes. You had to buy the, by the meter or yard and you went to a tailor and so on or to see what they call it mistress and so my father brought the stuff from other places. And sold a lot of, from silk and so on. Even British cloth that came from England. And also a variety of fabrics that were actually made in Romania itself. A lot of factories that did that. So my father whose story is also of interest, at least to me, he had been during the First World War he was about the age of 14, 15 and had worked in the store of an uncle of his who kind of exploited him so at one point he decided to go on his own. And there was a war and the Romanians fought against the Germans, the First World War. And he decided to go with a wagon and one horse. And he went and bought from the Germans and sold it to the Romanians and bought from the Romanians and sold it to Germans, food basically and so on. And he managed to three or four years to make a lot of money, came back to this town where I was born, Podu Turkului and started a regular store on fabrics and that was his, and he became quite successful, basically the most successful among all the other merchants. And his philosophy was, if I can put that in, was to buy as cheap as possible, meaning and how did you do that. By putting the money on the spot, not on credit. And he sold to all the villagers that came there on credit, because they didn\u2019t have money every time. Only after the crops came in, they had their money to pay. And they came and they were extremely good customers. They never defaulted. They https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham <) August 21, 2011 came and paid and so on. For many years. Even during the Second World War that something happened. This little town \u2014"

She, there were all sorts of, she was very beautiful and so on and she was educated. My father, on the other hand, had only two years of grammar school. But he was extremely good at math. And arithmetic I should say. And when he came to the town, that little town he said I want to marry Clara Marcus and she didn\u2019t want to and so on. And then one of her brothers who was older than she, said you should marry him. He is going to be a success. And not only this. He gave her, because there were my mother\u2019s who were, all the, they were orphans. And then 12 children in that. And two separate mothers. One died and then the father of her married another woman, which happened to have been the sister of the first one. Because that was the Jewish thing. She was not married. And when her sister died, there were already six children. And she gave birth to another six. But not all of them survived. So when this older brother who, by that time, was also very successful, said I\u2019m not going to, there is nobody. The father already died, my grandfather died. So they were kind of, there was no money to give as a dowry so he said, Clara Marcus is not going to go without a dowry. My https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 6 August 21, 2011 father never even asked, or anything like that. So he came and gave her at the time 50,000 of the currency. So in any case it was a very successful there, and they loved each other in, throughout life and so on. And until 1973 when my mother died.

And it was very, very interesting. They didn\u2019t force people to donate and so they got together, said well you should do this and they took care of everybody. Nobody died of hunger or anything like that. There was some problem in the winters and so on. People would go and cut wood for them or all these people. It was a really a civilized in that respect. There weren\u2019t, we had a rabbi for life there. His son because a rabbi and so it was very, very nice and people would meet during the summer, in the evening after all the stores were closed, they would meet and actually would have outside on the sidewalks which they put tables and so on and friends would come and drank something cold and talked and so on.

And the, between the \u2014 not connections, but the relatively speaking they were good friends and so on. And Ill come to a point before the Second World War, in the 30s there was a mayor. Ordinarily the mayor was a Romanian guy. He happened to be very, very good in fact very friendly with my father and he said in the 30s, when Hitler was came to power in Germany. And he kind of was a very intelligent man. He was a lawyer as well. And he said to my father, Isaac. Why don\u2019t you, he knew that we were capable because my father was rich by the Romanians, the standard. Just go to America. Take your family and go to America and he didn\u2019t follow this. Because he said I have all my family, his siblings and so on and so he didn\u2019t want to, his parents were still alive, my grandparents on my father\u2019s side. And the sister and the sister-in-law and so on. So it was a, he didn\u2019t do it. And so we were there when the, but what I wanted to say is that there was a kind of a friendship between the Romanian people at least in this little town. Not everywhere it was, there were some anti Semites as well in Romania. And we know that things happened during the war. But prior to the war for instance, to give you an example of the relationships is that when they said to put the yellow thing on the, to show that you are a Jew. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 8 August 21, 2011 You know you put on your sleeve. The police were supposed to enforce that. But they grew up with the Jews so they never did. So it was you couldn\u2019t tell who is Jewish, who is not. So that was the situation and I went to kindergarten there. And \u2014"

            "num": 17,
            "question": "This was a public school? Or a Jewish school.",
            "answer": "No it was a public school. And they had also a grammar school or public and until the war started, when suddenly in 1940 the war that came. Romania at that time was an ally of the Germans. And too, from the point of view of the Romanians I want to be, to say something that is not bad because they saw France defeated in three weeks. And Romania had just about all their forces. They had cavalry in stacks. And so on. And they said they couldn\u2019t survive. So they were patriot, from patriotism they said we have to go, even the famous or infamous men in power at the time, General Antonescu. He said and he was a patriot himself. That we cannot fight the Germans. In the First World War they did. But then France was not defeated and all the others were attacking the Germans. So because of that in the end, when the war came, the Germans demanded from this general that the ambassador, the German ambassador to Romania that they collect the Jews from the little towns, push them in the other centers so they will be there available for them to take until then. Of course, the Romanians at the time didn\u2019t know that. What was happening. That was quite secret, the Germans, the way they did it. So the order came one day in the little town, this Podu Turkului. That tomorrow you have to leave and go to the larger town which was about 20 miles away. So you can, people had the stores. What to do with the stores and the merchandise. So most people took whatever they could with horses and wagons and so on. And so did my parents, with one exception. My parents, my father decided he couldn\u2019t take all that. It was a large store for fabrics and that\u2019s very voluminous and how to carry this in a horse, in a wagon with two horses or something like that. So we, they took, what my parents took whatever was most valuable and so on. And my father went and actually put all sorts of wooden kind of in the front part of the store and in the back and so on. And it was so effective that later when we come in this story, nobody was able to enter there. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 9 August 21, 2011"

They wanted, if you spoke Romanian then you had a chance to go have a good life and so on. Nobody would bother you. But if you didn\u2019t speak Romanian, kind of immediately you were a Jew. And so they didn\u2019t spoke Yiddish with us. I never, to this day, I don\u2019t know much Yiddish. A few things that, but ordinarily they talked with us in Romanian."

So there is a little bit of skirmish and then they retreated back and they went to another road they thought. Well they were caught. Again. So we heard the sounds of firing and all this. Somehow I found myself outside the house. My parents were there but everybody was worried. Ok what\u2019s going to happen. So I got out of the house and took a walk and what do I see. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 23 August 21, 2011 I see a German soldier on his back dead. He had a face like yellow, dark yellow and blood coming from his head. And I looked at that. Why I didn\u2019t start running or anything like that. And that was one of my experiences seeing and so on. I wasn\u2019t scared. So that was my reaction and then to finish the story about this. They got some prisoners. They didn\u2019t kill them all. They, meaning the Germans. So some were caught and they were put in behind barbed wire in a camp and so on but they weren\u2019t killed so that\u2019s not what the Germans did to the Russians. They killed prisoners. It\u2019s well known. And so that was one of my experiences at the time. And the Russians came, were passing through the city. And now this skirmish 1s finished and so on and some Germans escaped and so on. The Russians army came more in bulk. And once more I was coming, getting out of the house to see where the Russians were coming. There was on the boulevard and so on, they were passing with their tanks and trucks and all that. So I went there and I saw indeed this group of tremendous group of, they were just going. They were shouting now Berlin, to Berlin. So as I was there. This is something that I did. I\u2019m not sure that this is a proud thing to say but I was, I saw some people coming from a building that was a government building. The government at the time, Romanian government had the power to sell tobacco. Nobody could sell tobacco. So everything came to this warehouse that was government. And the tobacco was not cigarettes. Just packages with tobacco that you made the cigarette and so on. And I knew about that. And that was 1944 so I was 13 years old. And I look. I let me go and I saw people coming out in boxes, wooden boxes. And I go inside too. I was just in shorts and so on, in sandals and a cap. Go and I see people taking this and go out with boxes. And then I hear shouting. I was still inside. I hear shouting and then a shot or several shots. To the ceiling. The Russians have come and they, oh tobacco. Oh. They wanted tobacco. They call it tabak. And so the people who were there who were adults. Romanian, probably. I didn\u2019t know anybody there. They got out. They were afraid to be killed. I wasn\u2019t afraid. So I take a box myself. It was heavy. And I couldn\u2019t carry it. I had to roll it. It was a kind of a cube. Not a barrel, no. It\u2019s just a box, a wooden box with the shape of a cube. So I managed to get down the steps there on a side street. The boulevard was here and this was a side, small street and there was nobody there because everybody were in their houses and by that time when they heard the shots there. And I started rolling it. And I brought it home. And my mother, my father said what did you do. And but I was there, with that. That meant money. Why? Because when they opened up and saw there was all these packages of tobacco. And so my brother was two years old and so on, said he is going to https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 24 August 21, 2011 take a bag of this and sell it to the Russians soldiers for rubles. And he did that. And that, with that money we kind of, my father started a business again in this town and managed to recover. That, that\u2019s a family history. Just my brother reminded me just a few weeks ago. We were talking on the phone about that. And it wasn\u2019t ordinarily my parents wouldn\u2019t have told, said to me well this is stealing.

But the Germans used some soap that were some people Jews bought them soap. They didn\u2019t know that this soap is made in Germany from the fat of Jews. It said so on the letters. I forget. Rhine, pure Jewish fat, something like that.

And then on the positive side there were, during the war, there was I said because it was an airport there, military airport, the Germans were in, with their planes, air force and also some Romanian who also were forced basically to fight against American and British and so on. So they came, their pilots and officers and so on and there was no room enough in the hotels or anything to put them. So what did they decide to do. The Romanian side said ok let\u2019s put these pilots to put them in Jewish homes. So we got an officer, who was a pilot, a fighter pilot, a man named Longulescu which means tall. And he was indeed tall and so on and he was a very nice man. He knew we were Jewish. So one room was given to him. And so on. And he came from a part of Romania that had never met Jews. That heard all the stories about Jews killed Christ and Jesus and so on. And suddenly he sees people like him and so on. And he behaved very nicely. He would get, bring us coffee that was something that we didn\u2019t have. And so on. And he was not married or he was, he had somebody a friend later came to stay there with him. But he liked me. I was the youngest so one day he decided to show me, this what he does. He takes me to the airport and puts me in his plane, in the pilot plane. And it was something that, it\u2019s so unusual that to hear some. Of course he knew I was Jewish and so on. And he puts me there and you know the pilots when they want to shoot something, there\u2019s a stick with a button. That, he doesn\u2019t take, he takes off with a full plane. So I was almost ready to push the button. Don\u2019t touch it. So it was lucky and so on."

Nobody did anything there during the war. (coughs) So I became very involved in that and so on. I loved it to be in, so on. And so did my friends there. And we were kind of, and there was a competition between the various organizations at the time but it was ok. So we continued to learn about what is happening and so on. And the idea of leaving Romania was at that point increased among all the Jews. But the situation was still so, after the war, people were not recovering yet. Neither the Romanians nor the Jews and so there was a big problem. So in the meantime we continued.

I think only in the, the next semester started the high school. So I was now going into the fifth grade in the public schools. So it was much better and so on in many ways than before that in a little town, that Podu Turkului and so on. This 1s a real school with Romanian teachers. But there were some French teachers as well. That again was a Jewish guy. And there was a Romanian friends who were very much in touch. Why? Because the Romanians got their independence in 1848. And they realized at the time because they had been under the Turks in the Ottoman Empire. They realized that they were behind in so many ways. So they decided to introduce in the Romanian language French words and for the new in sciences and technology and so on. So to this very day there are actually, that\u2019s the major language that they taught in those days and nowadays as well. Now of course English 1s part of it as well.

They had cities with buildings and so on and 2000 years ago and they were quite civilized. They had everything was written and so on.

I said then I\u2019m not going to go to school. I\u2019m going to stay home if you don\u2019t let me. And they believed me and ultimately I did leave. And the reason they believed me was that I mentioned that earlier that they had kind of believed that I was strong. Even more so than my siblings. And they based that on the fact that when I was about six years old, that uncle of mine that gave the dowry to my mother, he was married and didn\u2019t have children. And he visited at that time we were in Bucharest. That was before the war. My parents moved from the little town Tecuci to Bucharest because my mother said at the time, this is small village here or town. I want my children to grow up and they\u2019 ll go to school in Bucharest and all this. And my father sold his business and we got money and so on. Come to Bucharest and so to another business, but not his expertise. Groceries. And he had some also partners who cheated him and so on. And after a year or two he decided that he goes back to Podu Turkului and that\u2019s where we were during the, before the war started. And so this uncle comes and visit us in Bucharest and he said can I take him with me. You know for a few weeks to live in another town, a big town and so he asked me, you want to come. Yeah, yeah. I want to come. So they let him take me. But they said if he starts crying just bring him back. So I was there six weeks. There was no telephone and so on in the time so they could call. Only letters and I had a good time there. I was only a little boy there and he had a business of lumber business. He bought the places with trees and so on. And he had people cut the trees, they were lumber jacks and so on. And then he would sell the, do something to the wood and sell lumber to \u2014 and there was a big area with all these, and I played there and so on. And they treated me so nicely. Why not? I was there. And so after, I didn\u2019t cry, I didn\u2019t anything so they https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 31 August 21, 2011 knew that I could stand, could do that. So they had believed that I would, if I go I\u2019m going to be ok. And it was organized of course. So I remember in 1946 it was basically July 1946 that we started from Bucharest, this organized from Bucharest, a whole train with Jews that, survivors from Russia, Soviet Russia.

And I didn\u2019t, and I, we, so from this another story starts because we are now on the train. We are on this train were Russian officers and soldiers to protect us. Why? We are going to cross from Romania into Yugoslavia. And they knew there were still places in Yugoslavia, anti-Russians, anti and they were for the Germans there. And somehow they allowed the Jews, the Russians did that for the Jews because they thought ultimately that the Jews were the communists. They go to Palestine so they\u2019Il have a foot in the Middle East. That\u2019s exactly what. So they did that. They had no reason to bring soldiers and so on and officers who were actually nice. And so we crossed into Yugoslavia. We come to Belgrade. Belgrade is on the river Danube. And there we had to cross over a bridge but during the war that bridge has been destroyed by the allies. And so now the train stops. We couldn\u2019t go by train so we are taken over by a shuttle kind of a place, over the, to cross from one side of the Danube to the other side, because there was no other way. So we did and another train waited for us because the Jewish agency organized all this. So they brought us little by little. We had to stop and all this. They brought us, there was food there. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 32 August 21, 2011 They organized huge breads, round breads. They cut pieces and they had very well organized, amazingly. This was 1946 still after the war. Nobody has recovered totally. And they managed to do that. And they brought us to a place where we waited in like a, it was a place where it was a prisoners of war place that they kept Germans, something like that. So we were there and they fed us and we are waiting for a ship. And we were, the place where we went there was called Bakar which is a city on the Mediterranean and they ultimately we stayed there for about two weeks. And one day they said tomorrow we are boarding the ship and what ship was this. Was an American ship that was sunk on the Cherbourg in France, on the coast, sunk by the Germans. And was in the water. The Jewish agency bought it. It was somehow, they lifted it up. They fixed it and moved it. They fixed it and they arranged inside that we could go inside and lie town horizontally because they planned to have 2000, in the end there were 2600, close to 2700 people in that ship. The largest ever ship for in this migration. And so basically I said Mediterranean but we are the Adriatic Sea. That\u2019s they call it this because it\u2019s next to Yugoslavia. It\u2019s part of Yugoslavia. And so we, toward the evening we are told to come on the ship and board it there. And \u2014"

So and we boarded. It was so full but they were very well organized and as we came in, they gave us a package of things, like certain food in a package, very well organized. It was chocolate there and cheese and so on. Things that we haven\u2019t seen in a long time. Most of these people and chocolate. So I make the mistake of eating the chocolate and after all Iam only 15 years old. We didn\u2019t have that. I have no water. And my friends had gotten inside the ship and I was told to be on the deck. And the deck was full. People were sitting on the deck. And so full. They were families with children and so on. And now these people they knew what to expect because they have been in these https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 33 August 21, 2011 situations before. So they had taken also bottles of water that they were giving. I didn\u2019t know anything. And I didn\u2019t have water. So I sit there. So I was thirsty. And so all night I sleep there on the board. On the deck. And comes next day and we started around 4:00 in the morning from there, the ship started. And it\u2019s sunny, very nice and so on. And I, I\u2019m thirsty so I see people there with a lot of bottles. And I asked for a drink throughout that day. None of these people, survivors, Jews from wherever they wouldn\u2019t give to another Jew. So later on in the day, my friends who were down in the, they found me. Said oh, come with us. We have a place here and so on and there is water and all this and so they kind of saved me. But in the meantime, during that day, good I was on this deck. I saw people. There were boats hanging on the sides of the ship. And I saw people going into climbing over there into the, because it was better to be there. So why don\u2019t I do that too. It was crazy but I could have fallen in the water, there was no, I just held myself by, there were some ropes and so on. Some you know metal and so on and I reached up and suddenly a guy on, from the captain\u2019s side says all of you get out of there. Go back on the, from the boats. So they said that I got down and then later on I was found by my friends. So now about the, who is, who were these people who were the crew on this ship? Who was the captain? I didn\u2019t know until much, much later. There was a man there who was about 25 years old, born in Palestine, Jewish of course. He had a little training in ships or something like that and they made him the captain of this boat. Imagine, 2700 people on board and we are the British knew of us and they were waiting for us. And when we entered the territorial waters of Palestine they came with a war ship and told us to stop and so on. And at first they boarded with their marines and so on, with the guns. And they say where is the captain? Where is the captain? Trying to find the captain but."

But of course they were kind of stupid. The crew was already mixed in the 2700 people so they never found them. And they brought us to Palestine, to the port of Haifa and they intended to take us to Cyprus. That was the very first time that they decided to do that. So what they did when they brought us there, there were ships that https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 34 August 21, 2011 they had caught before and arrested the people there, the Jewish immigrants. The British I mean and they had these free boats in the port there in Haifa in the harbor. And they divided us into those little smaller, much smaller ships. Because it was such an accumulation of people there. It was very difficult to keep us. And the Jewish agency still came and brought the food, not the British. They, so they did that and they said they are going to take us to Cyprus. And then the Jewish agency did something. They told the people on the ships these 2700 it\u2019s going to be hunger strike. And there were a lot, because it was such an event. 2700 people on a ship that there were journalists from all over the world there. And they immediately, when they heard about oh there\u2019s a hunger strike. No the British are going to kill these people survivors of the, so they, the British said no. they are allowed to enter. And we are allowed to enter but not into, they put us into a prisoner of war camp and that was Atleet. And we were there. At least I was there for about close to two month because what they did, those families with young children, really small children and so on, they were given like 1500 per month. That was their allowed to enter. So and then came this, when these were no longer there, they took the other group and the younger people like 16, so not adults and so on. So our turn came and I and others who were my age were taken from there. The Jewish agency and then came on buses and picked us up."

The conditions there could have been, well actually the Jewish agency prepared everything. The food, brought in the food. They had local Jews who were dealing with that. Cooking and all this. And they were a lot of dining https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 35 August 21, 2011 halls there and if you come at this time and so on fine. The trouble was for these Jews who were from, people were born right there and what did they do. They stole from the whatever the Jewish agency and they got very bad food. And very little.

And not many people know that because it\u2019s shameful to mention that but it was there. And so after that the Jewish agency changed them and so on. And well it was like a paradise for two weeks.

And they wanted to send to some of us say well you can go to here or here or here and I said I want to go to Hashomer Hatzair. And so did a lot of my other friends there. So otherwise, they wanted to bring us to a religious group. But I didn\u2019t want to go. Simple like that. So finally we had stayed there for several days. And it was a beautiful view of the Gulf of Haifa and so on. Everything was the food was terrific, and the people were nice in those places and so on. And then they took us to a kibbutz in Ein HaShofet. Ein HaShofet is the first American kibbutz in Israel, started in 1937. That\u2019s another story.

We celebrated, tremendous celebration and but before that once I were in the kibbutz in 1946 and 1947 they were already trouble with the Arabs, before even the United Nations decided on this. I have a little story about the days that this happened. But so we were trained. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 3/ August 21, 2011 We started being trained how to use a gun. Rifles, machine guns, what do you call Sten guns, hand grenades, all this. And we learned even how to fight with bamboo sticks. Why? Because the Arabs were attacking with bamboo sticks and we had to, to this day I know how to use that because we had instructors that came from another kibbutz, a young man about 20. And so on. He taught us how to do that and then we had the training there. We are not in the army yet. We were just \u2014 and we were all happy about this. And so we, then came the day of the 1947. I anda friend of mine had a, who had a some cousin, older cousin in a kibbutz, near Jerusalem, Gush Etzion. And I forget the name of the group. So he said he wants to visit there and we had this, a time every year we got a week off. So he said do you want to come with me to that place. Yeah, he had talked with them and so on. That he can bring me. So I and he went there. And we had a very nice time, the three of us, very nicely too. It was a religious kibbutz. But they didn\u2019t bother us with that. So on the day that the United Nations had voted for that, we were on our way home to kibbutz Ein HaShofet. So we came to Jerusalem and we were in a bus that took us to Haifa because kibbutz Ein HaShofet is in that neighborhood. You have to go to Amick Israel to reach that. So we come to Haifa. We had tickets. We had paid for the tickets. We had no other money though. We had been given a little bit of money and so on and we are there. And we are in Haifa and we don\u2019t have money. Can take a bus, there was a bus to Ein HaShofet. But you had to go to the center of town and pay the driver. So what do we decide. We are at this bus station which was down in the, not in the Carmel and said well Shlomo, that\u2019s the name of my friend, why don\u2019t we go on foot. Exit Haifa and we\u2019ll go to Yagur. This is a kibbutz Yagur where we knew that the bus that was going to Ein HaShofet was going to stop there. So we\u2019ll wait for them. Sure, we go. We had this back, bags and so on and we are in shorts and so on. And the equipment was sold for, bought from the British army. And there we start walking and where, how do we start walking. In the bottom of Haifa to exit. And we have to pass through a neighborhood. What kind of neighborhood. All Arabs. And at some point as we go there, there you see them, there were coffee shops with tables outside on the sidewalks and they all sit and smoke and drink coffee. And suddenly from one of them, one guy comes out running and it was kind of toward us. And I say Shlomo, [foreign language phrase \u2014 Hebrew?) And then we hear another shout and another guy comes but he was after that guy. And Shlomo was a bigger guy than I. I was kind of short in those days. I grew up later. And I said Shlomo, let\u2019s go a little faster. He said no I\u2019m tired. Well I said let\u2019s go. But nothing really https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 38 August 21, 2011 happened. So we came out of Haifa and a bus stops in the, toward the exit, stops, came from the Mefratz. And he sees us there, two little youngsters there. He opens the door to the bus and get in. We said we don\u2019t have money, ein kessef [ph]. He said (foreign language sentence \u2014 Hebrew?) You\u2019re stupid. Don\u2019t you know what happened today. It\u2019s this and Arabs are attacking. They are mad. So and he took us to Yagur and let us off there. And then later on a bus came, the kibbutz bus and we ended up in the kibbutz safe.

            "answer": "Well that was. I was still in the kibbutz, right. And we were left and since the army was in, just started and so on, we were about like 17 at the time. But they were not taking people who were in the kibbutz because they needed the food that was, there was no other way just to import and so on. So they didn\u2019t take youngsters like myself at the time. So we were still in the kibbutz. Later on basically in 1949, but for us, this was, I must say this because the feeling that you had in those days when the, one may say oh we were scared right and so on. Something is going to be war. We knew that this 1s going to happen. They didn\u2019t care. We didn\u2019t care one bit about that. What we were, this, after 2000 years we have our state and this experience is something that nothing else in my life can be as that experience. To hear it, we are back after all this and being there. I\u2019m sure many other Jews in outside felt equally but we were there. We were there in the place and so we have been there, as I said for about three years and so on. So in 1949 our group was getting, we are by now 18 and excuse me, at kibbutz Arti which is the organization of Hashomer Hatzair, decided to put us to send this group, instead of leaving us in HaShofet, they decided that they have a place to send us, to a place called Gan Shmuel Al Kibbutz, Gan Shmuel Alomir Hadera. And why because the people there were elderly. They were not even Hashomer Hatzair. So in the past a year or two or three years before that another group came in from Hashomer Hatzair so the kibbutz would survive. But they weren\u2019t enough people. So they decided because it was political as well to have so take this group, Kevrat Udem that was our name, bring us there. And so they decided that. We were all sad and later we found out that the kibbutz was sad as well. And we go there. So in the meantime, this three and a half years we\u2019ve learned all sorts of things to do. We worked, we studied and I worked in the https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 39 August 21, 2011 gardens, the fruit and all this. And became an expert on that. But I learned also mechanical things to do. And we worked. I remember carrying on my back a 200 pound sack of stuff over some, and so on, to put it in a truck. And so on. It was ok. It was we were proud of doing that. We learned how to be on a rope and go up and down on a rope. That was the British army way. That is the best way that ever and I still can do it. So we are proud of all these things. But we come to this kibbutz. We didn\u2019t know where we are going. They were stranger to us and they behaved not like strangers, but like bitter toward us. They put us to do the, also to things that only us to clean the bathrooms and so on. And so and we had a man who is our supervisor, Madrek. We didn\u2019t know that he was really a communist. Amazing. And he is allowed to steal this probably. And at one meeting with him and so on, we started complaining. What are you doing to us? We have mech to ot [ph] meaning we have learned how to do this and you are sending us only to do only that work and so on. And you\u2019re not treating us properly. Because in the kibbutz it wasn\u2019t like that. We, if you learn something that was that. You could do what you learned. So they put us in some old, not buildings, barracks and so on. And crowded and everything was so, when I was one of those complaining And I said that that\u2019s not nice what you are doing. And he said, if you don\u2019t like it you can leave. And at that time, at the same time I said that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do. The next day or two days after I went to Hadera and I enlisted in the army. And but the army said you have to come a week from now. So I, where do I go? I have no place to sit, to stay. I have not one penny in my pocket. So I come back to the kibbutz. I don\u2019t know even how I, how did I come. There were some buses but sometimes you could do hitchhiking and so on. So I came back. And he found out that I was back and he said to me, you cannot eat in the Hadera Ocher, no more. You should get out. But my friends who were still there they came and brought me the food from there and so on. And survived and it was only two of us who did that. I and another member, Zev, Zev and Godol there were two of them. One is small (inaudible) and we enlisted. And then a week later we were taken from Hadera to another place where we trained, real training and so on. And \u2014"

You can continue if you want and then you are a member of the Sva Keva, the regular army. So I stayed because my parents had just arrived. It was like 1950 and I stayed in the army. I went into the air force, not as a pilot or anything like that. They sent me to the adjutant general of the air force which was in Jaffa, ok, Jafo. And I worked on kind of a, what can I call it. An organizer, not the community organizer, but in the time that was, we work on making units of the soldiers. And the air force was interested to have, from the reserves, because there were people in the reserves to actually organize them. We didn\u2019t have, we had planes but we didn\u2019t have airports for instance where you could go in the Negev or other places so the idea was if they want to bring help to our troops somewhere. We need to have that to build an airport and you are very smart in doing. I was designing at the time just young as I was, put together people and so on in this, in making groups and so on. That from the reserve people. The reserves they are until you are 50 years old, you are still in the reserves. So I worked like that. In the meantime, I was allowed, rather the army put together after work, schools. Evening schools to get the group, to finish high school which I started in the kibbutz but that was not, I didn\u2019t have a \u2014 so that actually was the way that within the last two years I went and I got, I went to the exams, external exams. But at the same \u2014 that was exactly like the ones given in the schools at the time. And so on. And the same questions. And I succeeded very well due to my teachers and I, at the end of that, in 1950, was I started, I went to the university.

I was trained in the Hebrew University, particularly mathematics at a level that MIT didn\u2019t have it. And very few of universities, the best universities in the world we had that kind of training. And this man really didn\u2019t. So when I would, he gave me a topic to, and so on, to go into it.

You should sorry. You should go to the US and get your PhD there. So how do I do that? I mean I have no money. My parents don\u2019t have money to send me there or anything like that. So well they had advertised at the time, in 1959 they advertised that they are looking for people in physics. And to apply, universities were applying and how come. Where did they get the money? The money came from the armed services because if you recall the Sputnik, everybody was scared that the Russians have taken over and so on and they really didn\u2019t have enough people in those hard sciences.

I didn\u2019t know that at the time that the Navy, and but it was deltoid problems in the Navy. And I was there for about, but I\u2019m actually before, before that actually I had a benefit of working after I got my PhD, the National Research Council awarded me a three year salary to work at NASA. And actually I have all this stuff here that my documents, ok. I\u2019m not saying. So I worked at NASA in Greenbelt Maryland. And that was very interesting and I actually this was basically before, a little bit before I got my PhD. And I finished my PhD and submitted a thesis to the, at Maryland and I was working at the time at NASA. And among the people on the committee that the final thing you know. You give talk about you show them your PhD and thesis and so on and they ask questions and so on. And there was one guy from the committee that was part of the faculty at Maryland. In the Physics, nuclear physics and he said to some people there. Wait a minute in front of me. This is not physics. That is what you did is mathematics. Why because my advisor was a mathematician, applied mathematician so actually he did work on areas that were connected with physical things. And what I\u2019ve done were I worked for NASA and I worked on things that were, dealt with what are called solar flares from the sun ok. And things that hadn\u2019t been done before except in my work at the time. So as I\u2019m there and he\u2019s talking like that and then my advisor gives a talk to my boss at NASA, Dr. McDonald. And that guy hears about that. Comes immediately from Greenbelt and comes to this meeting and he talks what do you mean mathematics. This man has worked here on this and so on.

            "answer": "OK so but I was still, then at that point I forgot to mention this, the order of the, I was with I worked for NASA and now I had my PhD. So because they liked what I was doing they said ok, you can stay with us for two years. They couldn\u2019t hire. I wasn\u2019t a citizen so they said you can work because the National Research Council will give you a two year, they\u2019|l pay my salary which was not a few dollars, right. It was. And I said ok that\u2019s fine with me and I stayed there two years and I did some more work. And published and all that. And at some point I was really https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 44 August 21, 2011 decided that I really didn\u2019t want to continue because the reason is that I as a physicist when I look at astrophysics as it\u2019s called today like with NASA was involved but we actually were, NASA was involved really in a real problems that had an impact on the, by the so called astrophysics. It was kind of not something realistic. I liked my work to be applied to something. And it wasn\u2019t with the exception of these things that were really important to study those because communications 1s actually affected by solar flares, these things that happened every 11 years or something like that. And it was important for the air force for the military and even for NASA to know what is going to happen in such a case if you send a signal for instance, it can be affected by and really ruin it and that is not something that you want to have when you are in say war or whatever. So I decided I want to go in, to a place that will let me do things that are applicable. And I looked around and one of my friends at school, from the school said oh why don\u2019t you come over here to this company in Rhode Island and Connecticut and so on. He was working for the Navy at the time and said well Raytheon may, and indeed they hire me and I was with them. And I worked on problems and so on. I have even here my, what I did for them. And then that particular one collapsed. Gail Schwartz: this is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Volunteer collection interview with Phillip Abraham. This is track number 3 and you were talking about working for Raytheon in Rhode Island. Phillip Abraham: Right. I worked there and problems that had to do with submarines. How to make sure that the submarine is not sunk by some missile or detected by an adversary. And this means that there 1s sound in the water. It\u2019s not like the sound that we hear in the air. But that can propagate through the ocean thousands of miles. And in the process may hit an object like a submarine. And reflect it. And if there is somebody there waiting with their own sensors they say oh there is something there. And they can determine sometimes what that something is. So I worked on that. And I did, I in my opinion and others I did good work. But this was a little https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 45 August 21, 2011 company part that I was working in on this. And it was actually given money for that research by the office of Naval Research in Washington because it was an important need. So but they didn\u2019t, the company itself didn\u2019t put money into this. And suddenly the money that came from this part of, from the Navy stopped because in other projects they didn\u2019t provide what they were expected to. So they cut them off. And Raytheon decided to close this place. So suddenly all the people who were there are out. They gave me two weeks\u2019 notice and so on. And now I\u2019m without a job. And as I said, this was like it\u2019s like 1968, something like that. And I am without a job and I am married and I have two little babies."

She was at the American University when I was at the University of Maryland and somebody said oh you should meet this and so on and we met and we got married. So we had, we have two children, a daughter and a son. Of course my daughter is close to 44 years old. And my son is just 41, 42, something like that. And so that was, I was in a, and I was at the time, I was living in New London, Connecticut because that\u2019s where Raytheon group was there, that particular group. Even though they are in Rhode Island. So I\u2019m looking and I\u2019m looking and trying to find a job. Finally I visited the University of Connecticut, the physics department and I see something there, maybe on the bulletin board outdoors that they were interested in something like physicists or something. So I knocked on the door and I met somebody named like Paul Clemens, a Jewish guy who got actually born in Australia, but had been in England, got his degree there. And so on. And he was the head of the physics department at University of Connecticut. So he said well you know I, we don\u2019t have a spot on the faculty but I can arrange for you to be here as a research associate. Some salary is better than nothing. So I moved there to basically University of Connecticut is the College Park. Sorry, not College Park. What is it called. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 46 August 21, 2011 Something, it escapes me now. In any case, I moved to that place and with my family and I was there for several years. And they didn\u2019t have a real lot of space for me to become a real \u2014"

            "answer": "Yeah. And on the faculty so I had to make do with a job still with the University of Connecticut but not at that place. But in Hartford they had a kind of a college or a branch up there and I taught there, undergraduates and some graduates. And ultimately I escaped that because there was no hiring. And finally I looked around and my friends who were in Connecticut and they said maybe you want to work for, let\u2019s see what did I do there. I was in Connecticut. There is a place that can hire you in New London that 1s not university. It\u2019s the Navy. And that, and I went for an interview and they hired me and I had to give some talks and so on and they hired me. And I was there for eight years as a member and I became, of course not a temporary but and with pension plan and all that. And then I decided to move elsewhere and something happened also in my family. We got a divorce. So I moved from there to right here in Maryland basically and the Naval Research Laboratory. You probably heard of it. And I arrived there and I was a member of the Naval and so on. And they started doing research on what they were interest and based on the work I\u2019d done before and I stayed there for seven years. And one day they asked me. There was a vacancy, a temporary vacancy at the office of Naval Research in Arlington, Virginia. And somebody that has your background and only for a month or something like that. Would you like to do that? Managing something. I never managed anything except myself and doing my work. But I said well I'll take it and see what, I wasn\u2019t losing my position at NRL. Ok. I come there. So they give me a whole program with money to go and the first thing I do, I interviewed all these people who had already programs from this and so on. And I had to cut immediately a group at Catholic U. That was, but what I found about myself, I found that I never thought of myself capable to do managerial work. But I learned and I became a manager as well, even though I continued to be my interest and I never stopped learning. So I was there for the rest of my profession with them until 2007. So that was, after 32 years of work for the Navy. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 47 August 21, 2011 So in the meantime, that program that I started there that I was given at ONR but I mentioned the fact that I didn\u2019t know that Raytheon paid my salary because they got it from ONR. I never knew that. Suddenly I am at ONR and this 1s life, very. So one day my program, they decided that they don\u2019t want to continue to do it. It was filled with submarines and some stuff like that. But they had been doing so long with submarines, basically since the beginning. If one goes back, the First World War when the submarines appeared and they were continuing in that and sometimes they reached a point where nothing new was done really to do better. So they decided not because I failed or anything like that, that they are not going to put money in that. And so what to do with this guy, me, that I am an expert in that. They said well there is here a group that works in logistics. Gives money to do science and technology logistics. And this right now it\u2019s headed by a captain who is coming, retiring from this job. And we need somebody else. Would you like to take it? Well I'll try. So yes, I tried and yeah in the meantime I had been, become also no longer belonging to NRL. I was belonging to ONR. So I\u2019m entering this. I didn\u2019t know what logistics is. Only some very primitive idea. I looked in a dictionary and so on. And then I looked at what this captain had done and so on. He was a very nice man who, but he was not a scientist at all. And what he did for, what he did was ok. But it wasn\u2019t the science in there. So here I was to try to find out exactly what other people have done who were being paid money and so on. And the first thing that does, I do, interview these people. I went for instance to Catholic U where there was a group there working with a program. And it\u2019s not logistics and I said you know I wrote to my supervisors at ONR that this should be cut off. It was something a million something for three years. And they didn\u2019t quite cut off because Congress intervenes in these things. And the people in Congress have the power and the people upstairs in the ONR, they unfortunately they, instead of saying no. This is not a good place to do so I didn\u2019t suffer from it. But so ultimately I took over this logistics program and it became indeed science and technology with a lot of people that were doing in universities and also industry. And maybe in institutions themselves. So quite a large I had ultimately something, a program with 35 million dollars per year that had to be, and I will go, travel a lot to see what they are doing and going directly to the people who were working on this and they had to give me a, every time what have they done. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 48 August 21, 2011 And so on. And discussing it and I would say go in a different direction and all that. And I was - and people were at least those who I didn\u2019t cut off were happy with me. But the, I selected the people who \u2014 and I had connections. Sometimes I would be asked to come and see what they are doing prior to. And in one case it was something in San Luis Obispo, that\u2019s in California and they have Cal Poly there. California Polytechnic. And they said they have a new method of dealing with certain things. And what they called intelligent agents, artificial intelligence, so called. And they showed me when I arrived there. They had three people with computers and the task that they had was to load with equipment a ship that 1s, can bring these things to the, of the Navy into the ocean and to resupply and so on with all these things or whatever to be. A tank or a truck or any, everything. Now to load something like that, it\u2019s not easy on a ship. A ship is, has all sorts of decks and it has elevators. Can they do this or not? They have cranes. It\u2019s a very complicated story. And they used to put two people to work for one single ship, maybe two weeks or more to decide whether they, how to do it. So with this intelligent agent, just on a computer having all the data about what loads they have to put on the ship, they could do it in half an hour and they proved it to me. And indeed this is one of the most successful things that I, and with not a lot of money. Some other projects cost millions of dollars and didn\u2019t perform as, but this with a quarter of a million dollars they advanced. And nowadays they have a company of about 200 people that work on this. And it\u2019s not only the US Navy and the Marine Corps and the Army but the British are paying to have this program. And it was really something that, and I also suffered from it in one sense. When you are in the Navy you are any government and so on, you defend yourself from anybody else by saying this is no good for us. We\u2019re going to do that. You know we don\u2019t want that. And indeed they refused to use something like that and this is a story, a long story in itself. But so \u2014"

And something that I saying this, I\u2019m saying this and people say you are bragging but it\u2019s true, a thing it\u2019s the truth. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 49 August 21, 2011 Because I started studying and see what is this logistics. What do we do? It\u2019s all these supplies and oh I need water. I bring a tank of water. Is that enough to do with that logistics? No, I have, I realize by studying it really not just for the Navy that it\u2019s much deeper than that. It goes all the way to the people in a mine for coal and all these materials that we do or the people who grow food and so on. Everything is connected. When you hear you know oh we\u2019ll do this or put this, we\u2019ll send shovels to Obama style, ready shovels. Who is making the shovels? Somebody. Well what are they made of and so on. Oh in the mine they bring this. It\u2019s not a circle. You have roots so many roots that to the final object. But even more so even military philosophy and how do deal with the battle and all this. So I wrote about this and so on. And only some people paid attention. And interestingly enough, after 9-11, what do they do? The Navy decides they don\u2019t need logistics. It was the stupidest, absolutely the, something that the public doesn\u2019t know. They cut at ONR they no longer have anything, logistics. It\u2019s to me it\u2019s a sad, very sad thing because many people have died because of that."

Romanian police and army. And it\u2019s very, in fact one of the, my friends in Israel, the wife of a good friend, she was there. And survived and she was hit with a bayonet in the back. And to this very day she is like 77 years old and she still suffers from that. But she survived."

It\u2019s so, when you look out in the sky and you see the stars and all that, and if you are a, those who can actually look through a telescope and see much more than we do, how can you say there was some spirit or somebody who created all this. Can he understand this? Absolutely not. Why it exists. There is a mystery in looking at an ant you. You try to pick it up. It runs away from you. It knows you are there. It\u2019s a mystery. I mean how. I know Darwin said evolution but that\u2019s a mystery too. Big mystery and sometimes even our rabbi at TI, Teferith Israel, sometimes says that his, doesn\u2019t know what to believe.

I would say the American Jews, there are a lot of them who are really not in connection with their history as a nation as a, no they feel themselves Americans and so on. That\u2019s a major thing and I feel that that 1s missing something. While the, those Jews who are born in Israel or who came to Israel they know that\u2019s a different story and indeed some Americans who when they are, became Israelis. But when I see at the synagogue for instance what are they doing many times. They are very active in things that are done in Somalia to people or other places and so on or in the District and so on. They never talk about poor Jews or let\u2019s give to Israel. Yes, there are in the prayer book there is a whole thing about Israel, and so on.

            "answer": "This, it\u2019s interesting. No, both and I feel that I am Israeli and I\u2019ll give you some examples of that. When I came here I was not a citizen. I was a foreign student so to speak. And I was when I became a citizen in 1968, they never asked me, meaning to have you denounced your citizenship, Israeli citizenship. Nobody asked me. And I thought that just by living and I lived by that time eight years here, I\u2019m not a citizen anymore there. And I became a citizen so when I visited there in 1973. I took my children. They were very young at the time. For my parents to see. My mother actually had died so only my father saw them and my relatives there. But when I and they said nobody, when I came back, I visited to Israel, I saw, I had my passport, American passport. Nobody asked me any questions. When I went again later on a few times, nobody they asked. The last time that I was there in 2007, as a matter of fact, that was not the last time, but https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 98 August 21, 2011 that\u2019s when something happened. They looked up when I came to, on the computer, they had my name because the time an Israeli citizen. I had a passport once which I still have a copy of that old passport. And they said you know you won\u2019t be let out from Israel if you either renounce your citizenship or you have a passport, an Israeli passport. So I said well, they said. That, I said ok, Pll get a new passport and I had to go to, and so on and I was lucky because I and Naomi, she was with me at the time, we had a flight back in a few days. And the bureaucracy in Israel is such that it may take you a month and so on. Luckily I have a friend from the kibbutz. We have been friends for the, all these 60 years almost. And he knew somebody in Haifa in the place of the passports, the passports and we went there and they did it on the spot for me. Particularly because they saw I had been, I served in the army and all this. So I said they\u2019re not going to do problems to it, just so I have an Israeli passport. So I\u2019m a dual. I mean it\u2019s legal. One thing happened when, before I finished my work and I retired in 2007, they wanted me to continue to work, not at ONR, but at NRL by being a contractor with a company. They would pay me and so on and work as much as I wanted. And I said ok. But for this, they said you have to fill out this form. And this form asked you, are you a citizen, what, of what country. And I said the United States and they asked do you have any other passport. And I said yes, and they said ok, we can\u2019t give you a, what do you call it, a security clearance and so on and work. I said how is that possible? I had secret clearance and now you\u2019re telling me, and then they came back and said ok, if you give us your Israeli passport and we\u2019|l cut it off into pieces, you can still enter the laboratory NRL. And I said no. I had enough of that. I don\u2019t want people to tell me what to do anymore. So money. They were going to pay me basically a thousand dollars per day. That\u2019s pretty good. I never had that when I worked a regular and so on. But I decided no. There is point where it\u2019s not \u2014so that\u2019s how I feel. I feel for America and Israel at the same time. I. Why, because I feel these two countries are so connected, even they don\u2019t, many people don\u2019t realize, including the Jews. How come? They if you look at the history of the United States and I\u2019ve learned a lot from the history, reading books. I collected books and so on from biographies and all this. And when you read about the founding fathers, what did they depend on? They went to the Old Testament which is the Hebrew Bible right and all this. It\u2019s so, there 1s no other country that has that and believed in that and the two are basically they, one invented this God and so on. The others invented how to behave as a nation. How to do it, liberties of human beings. That\u2019s what\u2019s https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Phillip Abraham 59 August 21, 2011 the connection. There is no other country in the world that has done that. Neither Israel as a nation or the United States as a nation and as a \u2014 it will be a tremendous tragedy if one of these two countries will disappear. And sometimes I feel very strongly about the United States that it goes to in a direction that is, to me is extremely dangerous, becoming something that it shouldn\u2019t become. When I hear about illegal immigrants and this is oh it\u2019s no, these poor people. Well they have their lands. And when you talk about South America, now you can call me a racist or something like that. I feel they have a land, rich lands. Mexico and so on. They have natural resources and so on. They don\u2019t know how to conduct themselves as nations. And in a way I remember in the time that I have been here, arrived in 1960. The Americans were Americans. Really when I look at people they suddenly we see groups of people that don\u2019t look, they look, looking differently. And I\u2019m saying bad ok, differently. Different. And to claim that I even wrote an article, not an article, but a letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal because there was a man who was a, in a consulate from Mexico. And here in the US. And he wrote, oh he doesn\u2019t understand why people are against immigrants from illegal or not. We are giving you the best of us. And I couldn\u2019t stand it. You know because they are giving us the best of themselves. How many scientists are coming here? Illegal. Coming people that don\u2019t have jobs, that they have the worst jobs and they are and they come here and so I felt very strongly about that. And that\u2019s only one, one thing. But there are so many other things that are happening. The freedom of the people in this country is in danger. With the government, what it\u2019s doing, taking over things that it\u2019s not, it\u2019s unconstitutional. That\u2019s how I feel."
