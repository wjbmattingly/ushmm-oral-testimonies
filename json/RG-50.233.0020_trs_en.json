Came back and the generator was stolen. Now the main problem with stol en generator, you cannot replace it. You cannot go out and buy another one. [_______You can\u2122t 11replace anything}. Cannot replace it. So th e only thing I was awaiting is jail for negligence. The war broke out otherwise I would be in jail."

Was 23no Gestapo, that was Wehrmacht. This was a very good job, very good pay in food, mainly food. I had plenty of food for me, had plenty of food for my girlfriend. Goodies like fried food, we could have everything when we were working there. You know, the Germans had plenty of food. On the job, we had all the food but on June 29, they surrounded the ghetto. They blocked up the ghetto; a special kommando came into the city and they announced nobody could go out to work. Nobody could go in or out of the ghetto. {By this time, the ghetto was already sealed. It was surrounded by barbed wires, tightly, with guards. It wasn\u2122t an open ghetto anymore}. It\u2122s no way you can get out. {No way you can get out}. No way you can get out of the ghetto. In the same evening, this was on a Sunday, the special kommando where they came into town, they needed schnapps. They needed liquor and rations, food. So they came to my boss, the officer, his name was Mr. Miller. They came to Miller and they asked him that he should give them, should go a nd give them ration of food. He told them I cannot give you any food unless you gi ve me the eight Je ws. {You release the eight Jews from the ghetto that work in my p_________, I\u2122ll give you the food. Because the Germans were only supervisors; they did the labor}. We did the labor; They didn\u2122t even now how to fill an order. {They had to unload also; it all came in huge quantities}. We had to unload so he told them he is going to take care of this. The next morning about six o\u2122clock in the morning, the head of the kommando came into Miller, the captain of the German and they brought him a special permit to take out the eight Jews . He came to the gate and he told the German and the Jewish police to ask for Aron Dereczyaski and the rest of them. Come out to the gate. The Jewish poli ceman came to my house; he knocked in the middle of the morning. By that time I want you to know that everybody was hiding in hiding places. Already we made hiding places in getting ready when the action comes so we build a hiding place. But I was still on the lookout and they came to my house and asked for me, Aron De reczyaski. They told him, he was smart enough, they told him that Mr. Miller was waiting at the gate. I knew when he mentioned the word Miller I knew that it\u2122s legit, that I can come out and see Mr. Miller. The captain was telling me to get all the people together and in half an hour he\u2122ll be back and we\u2122ll go out to work. All right, he gave us a________; he says don\u2122t worry --. {Nothing will happen to the Jews}. Nothing will happen to the Jews They found the underground organization on the Polish side. The Poles are organizing; they have an underground organization so we are going, the Germans, he said \ufb01we\ufb02 the Germans are co ming to go into the ghetto to check if the Poles are not hiding in the ghetto. That was the excuse. That\u2122s what they told me. But surely enough, we didn\u2122t believe it. {Nobody believed it}. I got all the people. {that worked in different places} in the p_________. We got out five minutes to seven. Seven o\u2122clock, the acti on started; we were only half a block away. We could see on the outside how all the German tanks and trucks and army and ammunition and machine guns are all pointing to the ghettos. Everything was at the end but we still walked to the p________, to the place where I was working. A block or two blocks away, we could hear already the shooting coming into the ghetto. We were just outside before. I think we\u2122re going to cut off here and I\u2122ll finish the story --. 24"

But they realized that maybe they should leave some people arrest and take them someplace so the other ones will start coming out from the hiding places. So the rumor came out that anybody who comes out -- they a nnounce on the loudspeakers that anybody going to come out, they\u2122re going to live. The action is over and this kind of stories. It was getting a little bit more quiet in the ghetto. Some Jews came out and they took them, arrested them an d they took them over to the jail."

I had a choice, to go from Zolkowyski or to Grodno or to Bialystok. In Grodno I knew that Lisa went. Lisa left by herself with her father and brother. They left the place in Sloni m a couple of days, maybe a week before I left. I split up with Lisa because her father and brother survived too.

I\u2122ll tell you the story in Grodno. I arrived in Grodno, I found Lisa, I moved in in the same place that they lived. They had a little space in their r oom with three or four other families. They made room for me; they put a mattress on the floor for me to sleep too. I stayed in Grodno and my only one purpose was, now when I\u2122m in Grodno is how I can get in touch with the underground. There was no other way for me to survive. Already my decision was made ; the only way you can survive. I had no doubt that liquidation is going to come to Gr_____too. So the only way I was looking around is how I can find a contact with the underground. I lived through all the time in the Grodno ghetto. I did not make any contact with the underground. You can imagine how hard it was for a young man having experience, belonging to the underground, looked around, being a stranger in a ghetto. Because some people were aski ng questions, why didn\u2122t other people go to the underground. It\u2122s very hard for me to explain them that here is a young man, has no attachments, no family, trying to find a way how to go to the woods or to the underground. I did not find during my time, I arrived in August of 1942. {Till March \u201a43}. \u201atill March \u212243, I coul d not find any contact to go to the underground. {Shortly after we arrived, they sealed the ghetto and they started the transports to Auschwitz from Grodno}. On November 1, the ghetto was sealed in Grodno, the ghetto was much tighter. You had to have special permits to go outside from the ghetto even to work. I went through all the time in _______ I went through all the liquidations of Grodno till the last liquidation. {Tell them that you are under --} We were always under leave (?). {Besides, I think Aron should tell you that he was on his way to Auschwitz and he jumped out of a train}.

So I was working over there with five other people. I went out to work as a carpenter and being over there, who took me in? a good friend of mine. He was working there so he said Aron you could be a carpenter, why don\u2122t you come out to work in this place. He worked -- I worked with him and over there we got acquainted with the name of this fellow Tadek. Tade k {bartered with him}. Tadek bartered with us. We brought in some different kind of watches from the ghetto and pants and some other clothing what we could put on us and then take it off and barter with him. {He would bring food}. He gi ve us food and we took it back to the ghetto. One time he came in and he told us, he told to my friends, two of my other friends, he says, he don\u2122t look Jewish, I can get you, I can take you to Vilna. {And give you Aryan papers so you can live on and try to survive as Christians} Try to survive as Christians. My two friends accepted it and after a few days, they went to him, to Tadek. Tadek supposed to send a note back. {No, Hershel, one of the people was supposed to send a note with Tadek that they arrived safely}. So one of my friends was supposed to send it, they give us a note that they send with Tadek that they arrived safely and they are safe. Because at that time, you couldn\u2122t trust anybody, you could tell the same Polish fellow. Any Pole could come and take away the money from you and give it to the Germans and get paid for it. The Germans would pay him fo r it. We didn\u2122t know, we weren\u2122t sure what it is. But he came a couple of days later to the place where I was working and he says that Hershel and Ludnik (?) th at was their names, they\u2122re safe, they\u2122re in Vilna and _______in the Vilna ghetto. But he does not have a note. The reason why he doesn\u2122t have a note -- he says it start raining and he had to walk away, go away because the Germans are th ere and he didn\u2122t bring a note. {When the police was around the ghetto and he was worried, frightened}. Worried, frightened and he didn\u2122t bring us a note. This way, he used to come every other day back to our work and we did the same thing. Bothering with him and one morning I didn\u2122t know if I can believe him or not but one morning he came to us on the job where we were working. He said I\u2122m going to take you, I mean the ghetto is surrounded, the ghetto is being liquidated. I\u2122m going to take you, if you want it, don\u2122t go back to the ghetto, I\u2122ll take you to Vilna. By that time I had to make the decision, should I take the chan ce and go with him to Vilna or I mean, I wasn\u2122t sure anyway but it still probably safer than to go back to the ghetto. The ghetto is being liquidated. Anyway I had to make the decision. I made the decision, I\u2122m going back to the ghetto. I did some thinking after that. I went back to the ghetto and Tadek gave me his address. He marked down on my body, spread out in different place on my body. I gave him my -- he gave me his address and any time I have a chance, if I survive or come back to him, he\u2122ll take 37me to Vilna. That\u2122s the way we part ed and I went back to the ghetto, coming back to the ghetto. I was immediately ar rested. Everybody who came in back to the ghetto and they pushed us in a big synagogue. In the synagogue during the day accumulated approximately maybe thre e or four thousand people. I don\u2122t know how much the synagogue could take in. We stayed there all day and all night, all evening. It was probably about six, seven o\u2122clock in the evening. It was six o\u2122clock in the evening; all night more people were already in. The shul, the synagogue was already almost full from people coming from work arresting everybody. They kept us there all day, all night. I was looking for any place to hide. I couldn\u2122t find a hiding place. The next morning, about five o\u2122clock in the morning, the Germans came in. They orde red us to get out from the synagogue and walk to the railroad station. That\u2122s what we did. We followed up, we walked in fours, we walked to the railroad station. I was looking for a place to run away, to hide. I could not find, the guards were too close. Here I am, already at the railroad station, put in a boxcar, locked after a short while, half an hour, an hour, two hours, who knows what the time was. Here I am in the boxcar, all locked up, ready to go to Auschwitz."

I decide with some of my friends, the one I was working with. We tried the hard way. I told him; I say I\u2122m going to jump. Here we have to break through that window. So some way we got pushed th rough, we came close to the window. We stood one shoulder, one on the other\u2122s shoulders, two of us. We know our power, I don\u2122t know where we got it but we pulled out the bars. We broke the bars, we pulled out the bars and I don\u2122t know where we got the power and we jumped out. {They started to jump out, one after the other}. One after the other. I was one that jumped out, the third one. I remember I wasn\u2122t the first one but I jumped out. The train, on a curve. It was slowing down on a curve. I jumped out 38and I fell down. I was unconscious and before long I was arrested, put back on the truck. I was arrested by the German guard, the one that was watching the railroad, the railroad lines, the tracks. Before not long, they arrested me and it was already about eight o\u2122clock in the morning. They brought me back to the synagogue. During all day, that was right in the morning, the synagogue was empty. There was only a few. By that time already they start finding people hiding in the ghetto. Nobody was already out to work. They discovered all different kind of hiding places and they brought them into the synagogue. Before long -- anyway, the first day, I looked ar ound, I did not find Lisa. The second day I had a better chance to look because I was the only from the first ones. I did not find Lisa. Till late in the evening, I looked around where can I hide inside the synagogue. I found a place in the synagogue, had a small little room where there was a kitchen before. Over there was a pile of coal. I saw a young fellow by the name Ruby Lawrence. {Ruvke Lubich}. Well Lubich was _______. {R-u-v-k-e L-u-b-i-c-h}. He was a boy from Grodno and he is making a place to hide under the coal. After a lot of begging, he let me in. There\u2122s a whole story to that too but I\u2122ll make it short. He let me make a place right next to him. By luck, under the coal, we found a big piece of plywood wh at we made a roof. On top of the roof, we found some dead bodies. We put a dead body on top of the roof. At the entrance we found a cooking sheet, where we covered up with coal and then covered people that maybe covered the entrance."

Ruvke did the same thing on a different car, he did the same thing and we nt up on top of the roof. Lisa was left over the last one, she panicked and she ran out. {I panicked as I looked back. 40There were very few cars that I saw and I became terribly frightened that I will not have a chance to climb up to the top to take the ride.
