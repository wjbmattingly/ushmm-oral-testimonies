Already we made hiding places in getting ready when the action comes so we build a hiding place. But I was still on the lookout and they came to my house and asked for me, Aron Dereczyaski. They told him, he was smart enough, they told him that Mr. Miller was waiting at the gate. I knew when he mentioned the word Miller I knew that it\u2019s legit, that I can come out and see Mr. Miller. The captain was telling me to get all the people together and in half an hour he\u2019ll be back and we\u2019ll go out to work. All right, he gave us a ; he says don\u2019t worry --. {Nothing will happen to the Jews}. Nothing will happen to the Jews They found the underground organization on the Polish side. The Poles are organizing; they have an underground organization so we are going, the Germans, he said \u201cwe\u201d the Germans are coming to go into the ghetto to check if the Poles are not hiding in the ghetto. That was the excuse. That\u2019s what they told me. But surely enough, we didn\u2019t believe it. {Nobody believed it}. I got all the people. {that worked in different places} in the p . We got out five minutes to seven. Seven o\u2019clock, the action started; we were only half a block away. We could see on the outside how all the German tanks and trucks and army and ammunition and machine guns are all pointing to the ghettos. Everything was at the end but we still walked to the p , to the place where I was working. A block or two blocks away, we could hear already the shooting coming into the ghetto. We were just outside before. I think we\u2019re going to cut off here and I\u2019Il finish the story --. 23 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

The minute we walked out of the ghetto we could see all the special groups are all surround the ghetto with machine guns pointing at the ghetto like a real armed camp. You could see that like, for me, it was clear that the ghetto 1s being liquidated and it looks like nobody is going to be able to survive. Sure enough, they will not be able (?) to get out with life. We start walking and on the way we were stopped and checked our documents again. The high officer stopped us and checked us -- our permit. He let us go and it happened that Miller knew all the big shots because they all used to come to him for different kind of parties that they made.

I stayed in Grodno and my only one purpose was, now when I\u2019m in Grodno is how I can get in touch with the underground. There was no other way for me to survive.

You can imagine how hard it was for a young man having experience, belonging to the underground, looked around, being a stranger in a ghetto. Because some people were asking questions, why didn\u2019t other people go to the underground. It\u2019s very hard for me to explain them that here is a young man, has no attachments, no family, trying to find a way how to go to the woods or to the underground. I did not find during my time, I arrived in August of 1942. {Till March \u201843}. \u2018till March \u201943, I could not find any contact to go to the underground. {Shortly after we arrived, they sealed the ghetto and they started the transports to Auschwitz from Grodno}.

My two friends accepted it and after a few days, they went to him, to Tadek. Tadek supposed to send a note back. {No, Hershel, one of the people was supposed to send a note with Tadek that they arrived safely}. So one of my friends was supposed to send it, they give us a note that they send with Tadek that they arrived safely and they are safe. Because at that time, you couldn\u2019t trust anybody, you could tell the same Polish fellow. Any Pole could come and take away the money from you and give it to the Germans and get paid for it.

She knew where Tadek, I gave her the address on Tadek. {Before yet, my father and my little brother went with Tadek to Vilna}. Before that they made the contact and they left.

I'll meet you on Tuesday in the public washroom; you come out and I\u2019 Il take you to Vilna.

After a long conversation with Tadek, he decided he\u2019 Il take three. I took Ruvke; he didn\u2019t want to go with me but I talked him in. We survived together so why don\u2019t you come with us. Don\u2019t delay it for another time. so all this here went and Tadek took us to the -- Tadek says for me, Lisa and Ruvke, follow us and we are going to the railroad station. We followed Tadek to the railroad station. Before we came right by the railroad station was a small, an empty lot. {A ditch like, along with the tracks}. Along the tracks. He told us you hide over there and Ill go around and take a look which train is going to Vilna. {Freight train, we\u2019re talking about freight trains. In between the freight are a couple cars, passenger cars that the Wehrmacht traveled}. After he came back, he told us, he pointed this is the train what is going to Vilna but it\u2019s very dangerous with the army going. END OF SIDE A, TAPE II He took out what-you-call-it. He told us that\u2019s the train that\u2019s going to move. He warned us when this train starts moving, you jump between the boxcars, the couplings.

I'll find you there later, on top of the train. The train starts moving. We jump out from the place, from the hiding place. I was the first one. I jumped out, I jumped on the moving train between the boxcars and I climbed up on top of the roof. Ruvke did the same thing on a different car, he did the same thing and went up on top of the roof. Lisa was left over the last one, she panicked and she ran out. {I panicked as I looked back. 39 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We made a human chain, Tadek lies down on the boxcar on top of the roof, we were holding his -- he shouldn\u2019t slip down -- we were holding his legs. He bent down much further and he grabbed one hand and then he grabbed the other hand. Then Ruvke was holding his feet and I came to help Ruvke to help to pull up Lisa. We pulled up Lisa on top of the roof.
