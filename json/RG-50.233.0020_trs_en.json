Was 22 no Gestapo, that was Wehrmacht. This was a very good job, very good pay in food, mainly food. I had plenty of food for me, had plenty of food for my girlfriend. Goodies like fried food, we could have everything when we were working there. You know, the Germans had plenty of food. On the job, we had all the food but on June 29, they surrounded the ghetto. They blocked up the ghetto; a special kommando came into the city and they announced nobody could go out to work. Nobody could go in or out of the ghetto. {By this time, the ghetto was already sealed. It was surrounded by barbed wires, tightly, with guards. It wasn\u2019t an open ghetto anymore}. It\u2019s no way you can get out. {No way you can get out}. No way you can get out of the ghetto. In the same evening, this was on a Sunday, the special kommando where they came into town, they needed schnapps. They needed liquor and rations, food. So they came to my boss, the officer, his name was Mr. Miller. They came to Miller and they asked him that he should give them, should go and give them ration of food. He told them I cannot give you any food unless you give me the eight Jews. {You release the eight Jews from the ghetto that work in my p , Pll give you the food. Because the Germans were only supervisors; they did the labor}. We did the labor; They didn\u2019t even now how to fill an order. {They had to unload also; it all came in huge quantities}. We had to unload so he told them he 1s going to take care of this. The next morning about six o\u2019clock in the morning, the head of the kommando came into Miller, the captain of the German and they brought him a special permit to take out the eight Jews. He came to the gate and he told the German and the Jewish police to ask for Aron Dereczyaski and the rest of them. Come out to the gate. The Jewish policeman came to my house; he knocked in the middle of the morning. By that time I want you to know that everybody was hiding in hiding places. Already we made hiding places in getting ready when the action comes so we build a hiding place. But I was still on the lookout and they came to my house and asked for me, Aron Dereczyaski. They told him, he was smart enough, they told him that Mr. Miller was waiting at the gate. I knew when he mentioned the word Miller I knew that it\u2019s legit, that I can come out and see Mr. Miller. The captain was telling me to get all the people together and in half an hour he\u2019ll be back and we\u2019ll go out to work. All right, he gave us a ; he says don\u2019t worry --. {Nothing will happen to the Jews}. Nothing will happen to the Jews They found the underground organization on the Polish side. The Poles are organizing; they have an underground organization so we are going, the Germans, he said \u201cwe\u201d the Germans are coming to go into the ghetto to check if the Poles are not hiding in the ghetto. That was the excuse. That\u2019s what they told me. But surely enough, we didn\u2019t believe it. {Nobody believed it}. I got all the people. {that worked in different places} in the p . We got out five minutes to seven. Seven o\u2019clock, the action started; we were only half a block away. We could see on the outside how all the German tanks and trucks and army and ammunition and machine guns are all pointing to the ghettos. Everything was at the end but we still walked to the p , to the place where I was working. A block or two blocks away, we could hear already the shooting coming into the ghetto.

In the beginning they could not find anybody inside the ghetto because everybody was hiding so by the middle of the first day, they put the ghetto on fire. They burned two or three ghettos; it was four ghettos so two or three parts they put on fire. It was a resistance in one ghetto, a small resistance when one Jewish fellow came out. He was a friend of mine and he came out with the hand 25 grenades. He threw a hand grenade on the German truck and he killed some Germans. The Germans got real mad so they put the ghetto on fire.

I arrived in Grodno, I found Lisa, I moved in in the same place that they lived. They had a little space in their room with three or four other families. They made room for me; they put a mattress on the floor for me to sleep too. I stayed in Grodno and my only one purpose was, now when I\u2019m in Grodno is how I can get in touch with the underground. There was no other way for me to survive. Already my decision was made; the only way you can survive. I had no doubt that liquidation is going to come to Gr too. So the only way I was looking around is how I can find a contact with the underground. I lived through all the time in the Grodno ghetto. I did not make any contact with the underground. You can imagine how hard it was for a young man having experience, belonging to the underground, looked around, being a stranger in a ghetto. Because some people were asking questions, why didn\u2019t other people go to the underground. It\u2019s very hard for me to explain them that here is a young man, has no attachments, no family, trying to find a way how to go to the woods or to the underground. I did not find during my time, I arrived in August of 1942. {Till March \u201843}. \u2018till March \u201943, I could not find any contact to go to the underground. {Shortly after we arrived, they sealed the ghetto and they started the transports to Auschwitz from Grodno}. On November 1, the ghetto was sealed in Grodno, the ghetto was much tighter. You had to have special permits to go outside from the ghetto even to work. I went through all the time in I went through all the liquidations of Grodno till the last liquidation. {Tell them that you are under --} We were always under leave (?). {Besides, I think Aron should tell you that he was on his way to Auschwitz and he jumped out of a train}.

So I was working over there with five other people. I went out to work as a carpenter and being over there, who took me in? a good friend of mine. He was working there so he said Aron you could be a carpenter, why don\u2019t you come out to work in this place. He worked -- I worked with him and over there we got acquainted with the name of this fellow Tadek. Tadek {bartered with him}. Tadek bartered with us. We brought in some different kind of watches from the ghetto and pants and some other clothing what we could put on us and then take it off and barter with him. {He would bring food}. He give us food and we took it back to the ghetto. One time he came in and he told us, he told to my friends, two of my other friends, he says, he don\u2019t look Jewish, I can get you, I can take you to Vilna. {And give you Aryan papers so you can live on and try to survive as Christians } Try to survive as Christians. My two friends accepted it and after a few days, they went to him, to Tadek. Tadek supposed to send a note back. {No, Hershel, one of the people was supposed to send a note with Tadek that they arrived safely}. So one of my friends was supposed to send it, they give us a note that they send with Tadek that they arrived safely and they are safe. Because at that time, you couldn\u2019t trust anybody, you could tell the same Polish fellow. Any Pole could come and take away the money from you and give it to the Germans and get paid for it. The Germans would pay him for it. We didn\u2019t know, we weren\u2019t sure what it is. But he came a couple of days later to the place where I was working and he says that Hershel and Ludnik (?) that was their names, they\u2019re safe, they\u2019re in Vilna and in the Vilna ghetto. But he does not have a note. The reason why he doesn\u2019t have a note -- he says it start raining and he had to walk away, go away because the Germans are there and he didn\u2019t bring a note. {When the police was around the ghetto and he was worried, frightened}. Worried, frightened and he didn\u2019t bring us a note. This way, he used to come every other day back to our work and we did the same thing. Bothering with him and one morning I didn\u2019t know if I can believe him or not but one morning he came to us on the job where we were working. He said I\u2019m going to take you, I mean the ghetto is surrounded, the ghetto 1s being liquidated. I\u2019m going to take you, if you want it, don\u2019t go back to the ghetto, Pll take you to Vilna. By that time I had to make the decision, should I take the chance and go with him to Vilna or I mean, I wasn\u2019t sure anyway but it still probably safer than to go back to the ghetto. The ghetto is being liquidated. Anyway I had to make the decision. I made the decision, I\u2019m going back to the ghetto. I did some thinking after that. I went back to the ghetto and Tadek gave me his address. He marked down on my body, spread out in different place on my body. I gave him my -- he gave me his address and any time I have a chance, if I survive or come back to him, he\u2019Il take 36 me to Vilna. That\u2019s the way we parted and I went back to the ghetto, coming back to the ghetto. I was immediately arrested. Everybody who came in back to the ghetto and they pushed us in a big synagogue. In the synagogue during the day accumulated approximately maybe three or four thousand people. I don\u2019t know how much the synagogue could take in. We stayed there all day and all night, all evening. It was probably about six, seven o\u2019clock in the evening. It was six o\u2019clock in the evening; all night more people were already in. The shul, the synagogue was already almost full from people coming from work arresting everybody. They kept us there all day, all night. I was looking for any place to hide. I couldn\u2019t find a hiding place. The next morning, about five o\u2019clock in the morning, the Germans came in. They ordered us to get out from the synagogue and walk to the railroad station. That\u2019s what we did. We followed up, we walked in fours, we walked to the railroad station. I was looking for a place to run away, to hide. I could not find, the guards were too close. Here I am, already at the railroad station, put in a boxcar, locked after a short while, half an hour, an hour, two hours, who knows what the time was.

Before not long, they arrested me and it was already about eight o\u2019clock in the morning. They brought me back to the synagogue. During all day, that was right in the morning, the synagogue was empty. There was only a few. By that time already they start finding people hiding in the ghetto. Nobody was already out to work. They discovered all different kind of hiding places and they brought them into the synagogue. Before long -- anyway, the first day, I looked around, I did not find Lisa. The second day I had a better chance to look because I was the only from the first ones. I did not find Lisa. Till late in the evening, I looked around where can I hide inside the synagogue. I found a place in the synagogue, had a small little room where there was a kitchen before. Over there was a pile of coal. I saw a young fellow by the name Ruby Lawrence. {Ruvke Lubich}. Well Lubich was . {R-u-v-k-e L-u-b-1-c-h}. He was a boy from Grodno and he is making a place to hide under the coal. After a lot of begging, he let me in.

He jumped from one roof to the other on the running train, in the cold weather in March, freezing weather, until he found --. {He found me on the outside of a boxcar almost hanging}. He found her hanging on a boxcar. So he came back to us and he told us I found the girl. We have to go and come back to the boxcar where Lisa was hanging. I, too, and Ruvke too, we jumped with him till we came to the boxcar where Lisa is hanging. We made a human chain, Tadek lies down on the boxcar on top of the roof, we were holding his -- he shouldn\u2019t slip down -- we were holding his legs. He bent down much further and he grabbed one hand and then he grabbed the other hand. Then Ruvke was holding his feet and I came to help Ruvke to help to pull up Lisa. We pulled up Lisa on top of the roof. There we survived from Grodno to Vilna was 180 kilometers, sub-zero weather. {I wore mittens and I had a vision that that I would give him the hand and the mitten would slip. He would not hold on to my hand but to the mitten but he was very skilful and I held on with all the strength that I possessed to lift myself -- and youth}. Youth was on our side. This way we went all the way for 180 kilometers till the next morning, it was still dark; we came to Vilna. From Vilna we jumped down, Tadek was first, we followed Tadek. He came and hollered and he says I\u2019m going to find a big group, one that\u2019s going back to the ghetto. {A group of Jews returning from a night shift to the ghetto}. You'll join the Jews when they\u2019re coming. {You'll jump in as you see them; you'll just run in, in the middle. That\u2019s the way it was}. That\u2019s the way it happened. We saw a big group of Jews running from the night shift going back to 40 the ghetto. We joined the other ones and we went in together. I will make it fast. In the ghetto, it was still a lively ghetto, Vilna. I don\u2019t know how many Jews were there at that time but maybe somebody will study, we\u2019ll find exactly. We came there in March, 1943. I looked the hardest ways to find the underground. I was successful, I found members of a Hashomer Hatzair; I joined the F.P.O., FPO-. {From Yiddish, F ,P ,O , | joined and after a few months later till in August they decided -- we went through the whole situation in the ghetto. We decided we\u2019re going to the underground. {The leadership decided to send out after the episode with Edenberg which I am sure we the history over and over again. We\u2019re on the barricades. We went through the whole episode of Edenberg in Vilna}. I joined the underground and then Ruvke joined and then a group of 30. We went out from Vilna, we went to the underground. We went to the forest of Narocz. {N-a-r-o-c-z}. It\u2019s approximately the same thing, 150 kilometers; it took us seven nights to go there. The only reason why we found the place because two young Jewish fellows {that were in the underground already) in their teens, what they left the underground, they came to the ghetto. {Risking their lives to be guides}. To be guides to take out Jews to the underground."

To finish the story, we were liquidated, I mean we were liberated by the Russians and I went to see my hometown Slonim. Nobody was left and from there, from Slonim I went to Beronovich and from Beronovich, I went to Bialystok. {Because you know, as Polish citizens we\u2019re allowed to go back to Poland after Poland was liberated by the Russians, parts of Poland that were liberated by the Russians}.

We already got in touch with the Br through the same thing, through Hashomer Hatzair. We were in touch with the B and we got directions to go from Beronovich to Lublin (?). From Lublin we got documents from the Red Cross that we are Greek refugees returning to Greece.
