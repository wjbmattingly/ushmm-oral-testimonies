We al-also always had, obviously Passover, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur. I remember the Temple. The women sat in a balcony, but it wasn\u2122t closed. There was no curtain. It also had music in terms of the boy\u2122s choir, conducted -- and I still remember him, by Lira Fleischer , who is also the head of the Jewish school, because the public school becam e closed in 1933, before I started, and the Jewish community had four classrooms within th e school, where the instruction took place. The main negative I remember, and this was after 1936, was we had to leave the school grounds -- or not the sc hool grounds, but the classrooms during lunch period. And we more or less had to draw a fine line of being in the schoolyard, between the boys and the girl s which were separated, because there were fights and so forth and it became more and more dangerous to be in the Interview with Fr ank Liebermann September 24, 2003 5schoolyard. Toward 19 37 - \u212238, we were dismissed five minutes earlier so that we could be away from the grounds by the time school was open, so that we could get home safely."

Did you have any fears about this kind of situation? You were very young, of course, but what can you remember about that different treatment that you as a Jewish child got?",
            "answer": "I just realized I had to be careful. I was given quite a bit of independence. I was able to ride my bicycle wherever it was in town. In fact, when the public swimming pools were closed in 1936, at that time I was seven, there was an old rock quarry which had water in it, kind of a small lake, which became the Jewish pool probably about three, four miles out of the city. And friends of mine and I used to regularly bicycle out there and as long as we weren\u2122t in groups, we didn\u2122t feel particularly vulnerable."

            "question": "What about the teachers in your school? Wa-a-a -- were any of them Jewish?",
            "answer": "They were all Jewish. In other words, we had no contact with the regular school teachers. I remember my first gir -- first -- I went through first, second and third grades, and it was strictly -- it was a German curriculum, but we had our own school within the school. Upper Silesia had been protected by a treaty covering Interview with Fr ank Liebermann September 24, 2003 6minorities when parts of the area were given to Poland, and therefore, during the transition minorities were protected, the German minorities were protected in Poland and any other minorities were also protected in Germany. So that the effects of the Nazi government really started in 1936 when Der St\u00fcrmer was at every street corner. Der St\u00fcrmer was the anti-Semitic paper published by Goebbels and they had them behind glass for the public to read, virtually everywhere. I also recall that in beginning of 1936, my parent s insisted that I immediately take swimming lessons and be able to pass a swimming test of 20 minutes, because it may be necessary to take an ocean voyage. When I was afraid of the test at the time, I remember my grandfather went with me and said, I\u2122m not leaving until you do it, because the pool is going to be closed very soon and I want you to be a competent swimmer. And that was bef -- before the summer of \u212236. During the time when the treaty was over, everybody was afraid of riots and there were some broken windows and similar things. My parents had the foresight to take a vacation in Bornholm, which is an island in the n -- nor -- the Baltic Sea, whi -- during these times, and when we returned the atmosphere changed pretty substantially. In other words, the so-called treaty expired and the community caught up with the rest of the country in a few weeks. Interview with Fr ank Liebermann September 24, 2003 7"

I think I have very good nerves and that goes back to those days, I just learned to kind of mind my own business and do whatever I wanted to. I had no real limitations except what I mentioned for school. In 1937, after my mother had taken a trip to Israel in -- actually, I think late \u212235, and determined that a doctor had no chance of making a living in Israel, my parents decided I\u2122d better take English lessons and I remember I had an English teacher and I did this probably about once or twice a week."

I remember among the safer playgrounds was an organization which was the non-zia -- the co-community was pretty much divided between Zionists and non-Zionists. The non-Zionits-nists being called the Schild, or Shield Organization. And there was an old -- there was a mansion pretty close to the middle of town, which served as our playground, and that was a nice place to meet and of course, at that point we only played with Jewish kids. My parents also shared what was called a Schrebergarten, which is a piece of land set aside a little bit at the ed -- kind of at the edge of town, into garden plots, where we had fruit trees and [indecipherable]. It was shared by about 10 families. And that was a place where we could safely congregate and that was actually a private parcel, which was our other playground in summer. In winter the Schild building was a place where we could go inside. The Temple really was just for worshipping. There was no Sunday school, as such."

In other words, I\u2122ll fix it for you, in other words sil -- and I reme mber my mother saying gee, I hope we\u2122ll be able to learn at least one lang -- to speak one language well.

And I know -- and I remember getting a call, a desperate call from my grandpa rents to talk to my mother, that the two brothers had been arrested and I th ink everything was -- and I just took messages, who the operator was, and when they came back, the world changed. So that was -- I said -- they got through to them and from that time on there was a -- first of a -- the primary objective was still, the state boards were in December. And right after the state boards, after he got notice that he passed, which was, I think the end of December, he had arranged to go to Philadelphia. Somebody had been recommended, a professor at Hanneman. He wanted to learn American meth -- methods. That was a fraternity brother. He said, why don\u2122t you go there, and he did that -- he wa -- he was at the pe -- their house, and he was particularly nice.

So it turned out Interview with Fr ank Liebermann September 24, 2003 31that this colleague of his, a fraternity brother, basically wanted to get him out of Cleveland because he shared an office with an ear, nose, throat surgeon. So he made the suggestion that Dayton would be a good spot. And even though it wasn\u2122t well meant, it turned out to be a very, very good recommendation, because it was - there was no -- the reason he went there was that there was no Jewish ear, nose, throat doctor in Dayton , but [indecipherable] he built up a very successful practice, partly with the help of the medical society in vetoing his admission by passing an expos facto law on a Friday night, sometime i -- after he made the application requiring citizenship. Somebody leaked that to the newspaper and the Dayton Herald , to which he was eternally grateful, had a Sunday editorial on freedom of opportunity in the United States . And the following Monday he had 11 new patients. So that was -- what do th ey generally say -- so anyway, the next Monday he had 11 new patients and that really established his practice. And oddly enough, his main practice was not Jewish. In other words, he was fair -- a fairly brusque individual and -- who said what he wanted and didn\u2122t have the be-bedside manners for Jewish pa -- that some Jewish patients preferred. By the way, another side. After the war, he was the recipient of the 75th anniversary award for international HIAS, for his resettlement efforts.

And that was the brother that took us to the ship and my mother\u2122s other -- his twin, and his wife and four year old daughter. My mother also had a younger brother, who was 11 years younger, who was running constantly to Berlin to try to get every embassy for visas. And at the age of something like 19, unfortunately was not successful. We never knew whether it was a question of age or just that they were hitting their heads against a wall. But the next thing we heard that they were t-taken to Theresienstadt, I believe in 1941. And they had been married by Leo Baeck , who was a ra -- the rabbi in Opin before he moved to Berlin. After the war, my mother contacted him when he visited Cincinnati. And he confirmed that they had been sent to Auschwitz in 1944. Interview with Fr ank Liebermann September 24, 2003 34"

Interview with Fr ank Liebermann September 24, 2003 59Philosophically , I think the Likud policy of trying to presser -- of the occupied territories is contrary to Jewish la -- to Jewish law and contrary to Jewish interests, because they\u2122re trying to create a South Africa , where we have -- you can\u2122t be a religious state where some people are more equal than others. And there is merit in -- if you want to have a Jewish state, it ha s to be pretty much limited to the Jewish population and you can\u2122t be Im perialist. Because strictly on basis of the increased birthrate, if they carry it on the way it was done in Lebanon, where it used to be 50-50, and then you had a ruling minority, that is poison for stability.

That\u2122s the reason I\u2122ve been -- i -- the Holocaust really has made me look at history, including by the way, the re-religious history of th e New Testament, or rather the -- the Christian Bible, to be correct. That in making it the national religion of Rome, Constantine basically had to absolve the Romans. And therefore, it was easiest to blame the Jews. And that is not an uncommon way of interpreting history, that it\u2122s always written by the victors, about the people who can\u2122t answer, after the fact. So the study of accurate history is extremely important and history is generally not taught very well, as to what the real issues are. I think that\u2122s the end of my thought."
