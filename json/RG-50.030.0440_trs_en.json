And I have only one, especially which is in my mind, one memory of anti-Semitic and hostile remark of someone and I was I think seven or eight years old. And that was in the house of my, a friend of mine whose father was a priest. It was a Greek, a Greek Orthodox religion was prevailing and he was a Greek Orthodox priest. And 1t was Paysa(ph) time and he asked me, he knew that I was Jewish and asked me very intensively about our habits and whether we ate mussels and did I know that there might be blood in it, etc. And that shocked me then, in much I did not cry or what, and that was my first experience with remark like that. Otherwise we had Christian neighbors and so on, we, we\u2019re just in peace of, with them. It was grade, I mean grade school and then high school we went to a private school and that was mostly, many Jewish colleagues, also some Christians.

In 1936 when I finished high school with my baccalaureate, the dream of my life when I was a little girl, you would have asked me what I am going to become, I would tell you a pediatrician. I had this great election for medicine. And in 1936, there was numerus noolus(ph) which means that I could not get into any medical school. I, resignation, I continued my humanity studies until 1940 when the Russians come in. The other indirect, so that affected me personally very much, the other indirect experience in the family was my sister who had her PhD at that time, still pretty rare, in humanities, in French. And she was very well qualified for being a university professor. She could teach only at the high school level and not in the public school. So that affected both of us. I would, now I can come back to the place which you asked me."

And I worked in factory in the, some secretarial work, I had picked up some Russian and that was enough for my job. And I, I mean this is the experience of the Russian Occupation. From my very personal, I told you that I had this 16 years older sister and she, she\u2019s much more, I was closer, closer to her than to my mother or my father. And she was not married at that time and we spend a lot of time together. And the, the discrepancy between her and me, she was crying for, for the collapse of the old world, of the belle epoch(ph), which she experienced and was very sad and, and worried. I was, and me being very young, there was a lot of curiosity what are the Russians, what is going to happen now? And I had a, quite a good year, from the, let us say from the emotional and, point of view, however, our standard of life went way down because my father is a lawyer, did not earn one penny, only what my, the very poor salary which I earned and my sister also teaching in some school. And so from that point of view but, and how did I experience that? I knew some, I picked up some Russian that I knew also from before something and I felt quite comfortable not, not enthusiastic but not really very bad, not threatened yet."

We were at the same neighbor, rang the bell and told us there are some signs, big signs put up in the street that you should not, but the signs were not a direct, 1t was indirect authority. It said something which you could not understand very well. It was written that you cannot, you shouldn\u2019t have contact with Jews, you should not buy anything from them, you should not sell them anything, etc., etc. And it was not clear. By the way, interesting 1s that the, my, Carl, my betrothed at that time went to work. He worked at the railway station. And he went to work and I was alone with my parents, with my sister and they told us this, this ghetto and we have to be there as soon as possible. And you already, we, we looked out of the window and right on the second or the third floor and we saw people with bundles already leaving the house. What did they, what did the Czernowitz people do, they, I mean, the Romanians. They enclosed a certain part of, of the city and all the Jews who had somebody there walked in and we moved to another, our house was evacuated, our apartment. And we had to move to some, some relatives. Interesting is, that when we, there were some neighbors in the house and they said, \u201cYou know, well look at that, they\u2019re taking us to a ghetto and they\u2019re, they will deport us.\u201d And my father, who I told you was a lawyer, he said, \u201cBut this is against European, the .

We of course prepared and then my husband came and, and all the family together, the whole family, I don\u2019t enumerate all the family. And we lived in house of a cousin who lived in a street which belonged to the ghetto. Our street did not fall into the ghetto. And we were immensely crowded there but we were still together. The family was together. And in, on this, yes, then we stayed there until let us say the, 16\", in this particular house."

Very interesting event, also, I would like to mention that my, my Carl and I, we had everything packed on this cart already, already, yes. In the, I go back. In the, the early morn, morning, I don\u2019t know, six or seven o\u2019clock, some soldiers came and knocked at the said to us, \u201cWe, it\u2019s, it\u2019s your turn. You better pack.\u201d And we packed the things of the whole family on this cart and it was loaded to the top and everybody was looking for only Carl and me because we were the youngest of the family. And we were, they were standing there, some of them, very old and broken, and, and Carl and I were walking the street, back and forth. And a friend of ours came and said, \u201cCarl, you know they\u2019re, they are making lists of specialists, of people who have a certain profession. And these people won\u2019t go.\u201d And Carl went to the, yes, and when we walked, some officers came, Romanian officers came and he accosted, he went to one and told him, \u201cI am an engineer and I hear about lists.\u201d\u201d And he said to him, \u201cStay .\u2019 Not one word, and, and left, this officer. Very kindly he said it and but only one word. And when we arrived, and then came our turn, there were cart by cart standing there in line and when our, it came our, our cart came on the turn of us, at this court, on one side it went to the railway station, on the other side it went back to the city. Carl took some bill out of his pocket and gave it to the soldier who was watching there and he took us to the other direction. And then we went to another relative who lived there but not in the ghetto. And of course, they, then we stayed there."

It was a house in a corner and, and this particular corner they assembled, the Romanian police assembled Jews, Jewish people whom they collected from several houses. One night, they, the rang bell at our, the bell rang, the bell rang at our house, at our apartment, in the middle of the night. It was two o\u2019clock and my husband went to the door and asked, \u201cWho is there?\u201d And they said, and they said, \u201cWe are looking for Kahanni(ph),\u201d which was a neighbor and which was hidden so she, they did not get her. But you can imagine our state of mind until we heard that they\u2019re looking for Kahanni(ph) and not for us. So, but we, that was it. Another time, we looked, we heard some commotion at the window and we looked down. We were always watching from this window and watching what is going on at that corner. And there was several families but my eyes was on one of them because these were some people we knew. And there was a very Orthodox Jew with his long gray beard and this is family and, in a very dignified way, he conversed and communicated with his family and he probably wanted still something from the house and talk to them. And, and I think these people let him still go back to the, it was very close to where he lived, that is how we knew them. And I just witnessed the, how to say, your faith as such without complaining or without whining unlike a neighbor of ours who lived upstairs and who was a very, let us say, simple and simplistic. And this man, we heard him walking back and forth and crying, crying, shouting, in Yiddish, \u201c , What do they do to us and what, what will happen to us?\u201d And he called, he did not stop, all night long we heard him like that and this is a quite a contrasting one, still to tell you that reminded me of something but I forgot right now. Yes. I know what it reminded me of. It 1s nothing to do with the Romanians and nothing, but it 1s to do with the emotions of people, when 1n, in time of crisis.

He was a young man with a big family in Russia, and this uncertainty, he addressed me, but it was just the outcried, outcry, the moment of crisis which remains the same. It, it was just a human outcry. So, this is what happened with this too, that is how I watched. And it was watching and at the same time, watching out for yourself and always being prepared.
