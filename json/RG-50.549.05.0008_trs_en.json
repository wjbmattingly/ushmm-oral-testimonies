Whoever was left from the family. He had two sisters and a brother there. The other brother was already on the front. And they had to run. So I never knew about it. A cousin who came five years ago to America, the painter, he was telling me the whole story. Why and how they had to run. And they went past Odessa and they lived in a small village in a house, he said, what didn\u2019t have floor. It was nothing, just dust on the floor. And they managed to escape, but they had very, very hard times. His parents were alive that time, but the father and the mother, they all died. Actually they say that it was from hunger they died, but I don\u2019t know actually what was the reason they died, because they had very, very hard times. And after that my cousin, who had his mother... no, I\u2019m sorry. The cousin, he has a sister, who is very, very sick. She\u2019s here too, in Boston. And him and the sister and the husband, and she had a daughter the same age as George is and a son, they settled down in Odessa. So, when the doors were opening here that the Russians can come, he didn\u2019t think about it. He was just writing me, \u201cSave my daughter,\u201d who lived in Moscow and had two little children. I told you that story. No?"

            "answer": "She had two little, beautiful daughters and her husband was Jewish. And she was a half-Jew, because her mother wasn\u2019t Jewish. And the mother was a practicing Russian Orthodox, so she, I think she brainwashed her. But she\u2019s supposed to come to America, too. She was on the quota, too. In fact, they are still bothering me that, \u201cWhere is she?\u201d I says, \u201cMany times, I\u2019ve told you that she won\u2019t come, never. Please cross her off because she is taking somebody\u2019s place.\u201d They lived with the husband\u2019s mother, whose husband died, he was injured in the war. I don\u2019t know, I think he lost his leg. He went underground with the Russians. I don\u2019t know that whole story, but I know that they had an apartment in Moscow and the son lived with the mother. He went to school in Moscow and he 1s an engineer. She, he met my cousin in school, who went for engineering, too. Civil engineers. They met there and he knew that she\u2019s half-Jew, but she promised him everything, everything what you want. If they are going to have children they are going to be brought up as Jews. And then she hated Communism, she just couldn\u2019t stand it. I didn\u2019t know why, but when I found out it was too late already. Because she couldn\u2019t go to church. So they came to America. The first Hanukkah, the television came here to our house and took pictures from them, because they were here for the first Hanukkah. So they are here, they were here for six years. Now it was my husband\u2019s, my son\u2019s birthday, November 20\", they came Six years ago."

But the mother had a brother in Brooklyn and the brother wanted them to go to Brooklyn. And I got his name and I spoke to him and I said, \u201cLook, I know that you love your sister, but the children, they would be much, much better off here in Lexington to bring up children.\u201d Finally he gave in and the Federation did it for me. They brought them here. They were waiting for them with a three-bedroom apartment, because the two mothers should come after them. So, they had a three-bedroom apartment. And the television was on the airport, when the first families came. It was a big deal. And Ana was out of her mind that she will have some relatives...  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

            "question": "Galina...?",
            "answer": "Galina Bashikis (ph). Bashikis. My son, by coincidence got him a job with the Gray Construction Company, because she had a student, he had a student in one of the schools, who was his student and then she became a teacher. And he went back with his children there. He goes always, one semester he takes his class to schools and they are... Adopt a School, that\u2019s the name of it. And they are teaching there, but they are just students, not graduate students and he\u2019s observing them before they make their lesson plans and they have to show it to him. And he\u2019s running from class to class. And one day, she came to that school and she said, \u201cDoes anybody know somebody who has connections to a construction company?\u201d And that teacher, he says, \u201cMy fiance,\u201d one of the Grays\u2019 son. He says, \u201cMy fianc\u00e9.\u201d So, from that time on they hired him, and he\u2019s a person who, he didn\u2019t mind what kind of job they gave him. He did very hard job. And he loves the construction. He loves to see. He was in, I don\u2019t know how many buildings he builded. He was already a big shot there. When they got their visa to come to America. And he work day and night for an apartment in Moscow. In the middle of Moscow the apartment was ready and they would be separated from the mother-in-law. And they would have a beautiful apartment there. And the visa was starting to expire, so my cousin said, \u201cIt 1s not worth, what is thousands of thousands dollars that apartment. It doesn\u2019t worth, you have to go.\u201d He was in Odessa, but he helped them. He came to Moscow and helped them to pack and they came. And she was very happy. And when she got to the apartment she couldn\u2019t believe it. You know, they lived in two small rooms there, so many people, four. I mean two children and the couple and the grandmother. And she was very happy. One day... she sent, before she came, she sent a hundred and twenty packages to my name, because she didn\u2019t know where to send it and they were all Russian books. And I said, \u201c\u201cThat woman is crazy. She needs American books. Why is she sending the Russian books?\u201d But all, you know, Dostoevsky, whatever. The children, the big one... the little one didn\u2019t go to school yet, but the big one went to school, to the same school where my husband got the job from the teacher. It was in their neighborhood. And she spoke beautiful English already and she had... when the grandmother came the following year in January, his mother came. She didn\u2019t come, the other one. And she was  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And then I started to see it. I started to invite them for holidays, and she came. She sat at the table five minutes and after five minutes she excused herself and went to the porch to play with the children. I didn\u2019t think about nothing, about it. I says, \u201cIt\u2019s a little strange, but okay if she wants it.\u201d When it come the second year, she said, \u201cI love you, but please don\u2019t invite us for the holidays.\u201d Still I didn\u2019t think it was something wrong there. Then she met a couple, I still don\u2019t know who they are, a Christian couple, who went every week to Cincinnati. And she got very friendly with them. And she went with the two children and the reason was, because she went for his American degree, what he got, no problem. He got his American degree, but when the children are home, he cannot study. And we go there. It\u2019s more things to do there. We take them to the zoo and blah, blah, blah. One day they come home, it was probably a year later and the father is asking them, \u201cHow was the zoo?\u201d And the big one said, \u201cWhat kind of zoo?\u201d He says, \u201cYou didn\u2019t go to the zoo?\u201d She says. \u201cNo, we went to the church.\u201d So he got very upset that she does it behind his back. Very, very upset. And I don\u2019t know whether they knew it... he was married eleven years, but they knew each other five years already from the school. And I don\u2019t know the situation, because the grandmother was there with them. But he was traveling a lot. The company was sending him constantly, because they mostly work outside from Lexington. They build big, big factories, not housing. And he was always sent out. One, two years after they were here, she says, \u201cI want to go home for the summer, to visit my mother.\u201d I says, \u201cIsn\u2019t 1t easier to bring your mother here?\u201d She says, \u201cNo, my mother wouldn\u2019t like it here.\u201d She packed. And she liked me. She was working in the St. Joseph Hospital, though she was an engineer and she went for courses to... computer courses to the community college. But that job, cleaning job, she took at night, that she should be with the children during the day. What was the job? She was calling me on the phone constantly for hours. She says, \u201cI am cleaning the clean stuff, the offices...\u201d and she says, \u201cIt\u2019s... in an hour I am ready.\u201d Perfect. Salary was perfect, everything was perfect. Two years, right two years after in the summer, 1t was August. And sometimes I was taking her, I was driving her to work. They didn\u2019t live close here, but I picked her up. They lived in, it\u2019s Heritage Village, near Henry Clay High School. That\u2019s where all the Russians lived at that time. I\u2019m sorry. I picked her up and I took her to work. And she says, \u201cI want to tell you something, because I love you. But you must swear that you won\u2019t tell it to Mischa.\u201d Mischa, Michael is her husband. I thought, \u201cMy God what it could be that I cannot tell it to him?\u201d So, I says, \u201cOkay, I swear.\u201d And I am driving. I almost made an accident what I heard. She says, \u201cI\u2019m not coming back. I took a ticket, round trip, but I\u2019m not coming back. I don\u2019t want my children to be brought up here. I want them to be brought up as Russians,\u201d and it meant... because she never mentioned Jew. She mentioned Americans and Russians. I says, \u201cYou are talking about Americans as Jews and Russians,\u201d right away I knew, \u201c...as the Russian Orthodox Church?\u201d She says, \u201cNo, no. I don\u2019t mean that.\u201d I says, \u201cYes you mean it. You mean it.\u201d The husband was... I don\u2019t know where. And he came home, and it was the little one\u2019s birthday. And she made a birthday party and I was there. And they\u2019re supposed to leave the following day to New York. And the father, who lived in Boston, was visiting... we have a summer home in the country, in the Catskills and he was with my son there. And he\u2019s supposed to go to the airport, help her to go to the airport in New York. So, I said to myself, I just couldn\u2019t believe it. I says, \u201cWhy are you doing it? How can you look in your husband\u2019s eye and pack?\u201d I don\u2019t know, everything she took, what she could. Six packages, because they took two, two, two, everyone of them and they were little kids. She says, \u201cIf he would be better to me...\u201d I says, \u201cBetter? He lives for you. He\u2019s such a father and working like unbelievable that you should have everything.  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

That was the worst. And she told it in the hospital that if I don\u2019t come back, because my husband is bad to me. So, what shall Ido? I swore. I cannot tell it to Mischa. I called my cousin in the country. I says, \u201cLook, I swore that I don\u2019t tell 1t to Mischa, but I didn\u2019t swear that I\u2019m not telling it to you. Your daughter won\u2019t come back. Please don\u2019t help her to go on that plane. At least the children should be saved and taken away, because she kidnapped them.\u201d She said, \u201cThat\u2019s... it\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d And when she didn\u2019t come back after a month, she went for a month, and I said, I told it to Mischa. She says, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. She\u2019s the most honest woman in the world. If you would tell it to me right at that time, I wouldn\u2019t believe you, that she is doing it to me.\u201d And she did it. She kidnapped the two kids."

            "answer": "To Izzy, his name is Izzy, my cousin who is the painter. He was writing to him and then he went to visit. And he had two sisters, two sisters alive at the time and him, who was the nephew. He was alive. So, after 50 years. He went back twice, because he went alone and then he took his wife one year. And so, I knew everything about him. And I knew that he was a big artist there, but he worked for the state, Communism. They always had work, but they had to do what they told them to do. So, he was a real artist and then he had a little studio separate from the house. And he painted what he wanted, because his dream... he loves Odessa and he wanted to paint Odessa as he knew it once. And he did it. They didn\u2019t know about it, because he did the commercials for everything, for the ships and for operas and everything. His name was everywhere because he did the commercials. So, I knew about him. Now, when my uncle died in 1973, I took over the writing because it was no one else. And I started to write Russian, but it was very hard for me, because I never spoke Russian. But I wrote Russian and I understood Russian. So, with the dictionary, I wrote him Russian. And one day, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t struggle, I speak English.\u201d And from then on, I was sending him English letters. And then he had an exhibition in Moscow and he was narrating it in English. And he sent us the tape. And we couldn\u2019t use the tape here. I had to take it to downtown. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the name of the place. Anyway, where they re-did it. It was a beautiful... I gave it to him when he came. I gave it back to him. I says, \u201cI have you, and I have your paintings, and you should have that tape.\u201d And I read in the Hadassah paper, last month, that his paintings are still... somebody, you know they have articles about the world, travelers and it was from Odessa and they mentioned his name, that his paintings are still there, but he\u2019s not there anymore.

And he was captured and they didn\u2019t know about him, where is he. And one day, when my father was called in and he was captured in Prague and they took him behind the frontier to a pharmacy and there he meets his brother. And he met his brother and they never separated. They didn\u2019t want to go back after the war because there were the biggest pogroms in Kiev and they didn\u2019t want to go back there. And it was an international agreement that they can stay in the countries where they were captured. Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia was one, Austro-Hungarian empire. So, after a while when they were there, they took them to Hungary to a chemical factory, both of them, together. I have, I think there\u2019s a picture there, too, about them in Russia uniforms. They took them to Hungary and under the war my mother was working there in the office, in that place. And that\u2019s how they met and fell in love. And my mother\u2019s family was very, very upset. Nothing against him, it was nothing against him, but they were very worried that he\u2019s a Russian citizen, what\u2019s going to be? From then on, I think it\u2019s there. No?

            "question": "And so they are living nearby one another and they ended up in Czechoslovakia.",
            "answer": "Yes, because they had to, because it was Communism in 1919 in Hungary for a little while only and they said that no matter what, every Russian is a Communist, Jew or non-Jew. And they put \u2014 oh I have a picture here. It\u2019s very interesting. They made a concentration camp. They builded near Russia... near Budapest and they put all the Russians there. My mother was married in 1919, the beginning of 1919. And they put them there. They didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to them. My uncle was there. He wasn\u2019t married. My mother had a cousin, who was a lawyer and he came there one day. It was already May, middle of 1919, because she was pregnant with me. By the way, she got pregnant. She was pregnant with me. And she said, he said, \u201cYou can go out from here only one way, if you sign that you never come back to Hungary.\u201d So, my mother, who was Hungarian, she had to sign that she never comes back to Hungary. It was easy to sign it for my father and my uncle, but they had to sign it. So, where should they go? In 1920, Czechoslovakia it was, the Czech map 1s Czech, Moravia, Slovakia, Carpathan. The Carpathan part, what was Hungary, after the war, the Czechs got it. My mother had a second cousin there and when she heard about it, what happened, she says, \u201cCome to us.\u201d They were well-to-do people. \u201cCome to us.\u201d So, they went there to Czechoslovakia. It was at that time Czechoslovakia in 1920. When it came to me, to give birth, my mother got permission through that lawyer to go home and I was born in my grandmother\u2019s house, but they didn\u2019t have an apartment. They did have... they lived with those relatives, so they left me there with my grandmother and my mother\u2019s sisters. She had three sisters. One of them was married, two were not married and a brother, who was never married. He was a bachelor. Because my grandmother was a widow when she was 34 years old, and she had five children. The son took over and he was working for the family. And that\u2019s why he never got married, until the sisters got married and whatever. He was already 50 years old and he didn\u2019t get married. So we lived there and 22 months after I was born, my mother was again \u2014 she was pregnant. She gave birth to my sister. The same thing happened. She went home with special papers and she was born there in my grandmother\u2019s house. By that time they had already an apartment and they took me together with my little sister back to Czechoslovakia. So."

            "answer": "I remember from kindergarten on. I went right away to Czech school. Kindergarten, elementary school, gymnasium. I wanted to be a pharmacist. And they had two kind of... my father wanted one of us, at least, to be a pharmacist. And we had two kinds of gymnasiums, very strict schools in Czechoslovakia. All the professors were from Prague. And there were two kinds, one where you had to learn Latin, because every prescription was Latin and if you wanted to be a doctor or pharmacist you had to go to that gymnasium. So I went to... both of us went. I don\u2019t even know what she wanted to be, because she was unbelievable smart, much smarter than I was. She was always worried about me, my sister, because it was only 22 months between us. And when I went to first class, I got whooping cough for six months. So I had to repeat the first class, so we were always together. We sat together. Here they don\u2019t let you do it. We were always together and everybody thought that we were... I don\u2019t know. Because we were dressed the same and they thought that we are twins, but we weren\u2019t because it was 22 months between us. But we were together always in school. But she was a worrier always about me. I remember when she woke me up in the morning and let me repeat the lesson plan, lesson, what we had to do, you know. She was always worried about me. I was a good student, but to her it came very easy. To me, I had to work for it. And it was a very, very close family. I just, I cannot, cannot tell you. When they met, my father and mother on the street it was always like, you know, they were married yesterday. Very, very close. My mother was like a friend to us. With everything you could go to my mother and ask everything what you wanted and you got the right answer. I was a very, very naive girl, very naive. And one girl was once telling me that if you kiss somebody you can get pregnant, that kind of a business. So I always went to my mother. I says, \u201cIs it true?\u201d I don\u2019t know what grade was it. But with everything...when I went on a date and I came home, I went to their bedroom, I sat on the bed and I told them everything what happened. That kind of a close family we were. And that\u2019s why I cannot understand today\u2019s generation, because it was so different. When I said to my granddaughter that I went for, for four years I had a boyfriend, a boy friend, friend, nothing happened between us. And for one year, for one year, he didn\u2019t even kiss me, because he said he\u2019s very afraid that if he\u2019s going to kiss me, I\u2019m going to leave him, because of my personality. He was an unbelievable, very, very beautiful boy and he left a very wealthy girl because of me. He loved me very much, but I was so naive that I didn\u2019t think that I love him. But it was a beautiful, wonderful feeling that every week he came. We met twice a week, Saturday and Sunday. Every week he came and his hands were behind his back and he brought me \u2014 because he knew I loved the... what are the little blue flowers?"

His father had a pawn shop. And he had a sister, who was teaching piano. And we never spoke about marriage because he always said, he spoke already English at that time. And one day, in 1938, the Hungarians took back that part of Czechoslovakia. So we were in trouble, but we children didn\u2019t realize it that we are in trouble, only my parents. And it was terrible. And then he said to me, one day when he came home, he says, \u201cCome with me to Israel.\u201d I looked at him.

But they never got married, because he died in... they took him to Russia, that transport labor camp. And he died. And he was the only one who died from his family, because he had a brother who survived in England and his parents and sisters survived there in Uzhgorod where we lived. People were hiding them.

He was in labor camps, but they took them out from that part of Czechoslovakia. They took them out to Russia. In Hungary, they kept them in Hungary in labor camp. But that was part of, you know, that was that time, they took, like over the border and they took them to camps. And when I wrote them that what happened, that I need another name.

And he said that for one day he disappeared in the woods and they thought he is committing suicide because of me. But then he came and they took him and all of them died.

And we wouldn\u2019t, he wouldn\u2019t dare to do nothing, because he said that, \u201cYour personality is requiring such a...\u201d \u2014I cannot say it in English, that word. Respect.

It took me a long, long time to realize that my granddaughter were not seven years with his boyfriend and nothing happened between them. I just... I couldn\u2019t imagine that something could happen... you know\u201d? I trusted her, because I was that way, so I thought, always I thought that Ilona is ours, from our family. And my husband always said to me, \u201cNo matter what, you always can count on Ilona.\u201d He was always telling me that. And if you leave something for the children, he said, \u201cJacob is a boy, he will always make it. Leave more for Ilona.\u201d That\u2019s what he always said. He was mistaken, too."

They was the same age, my father and my mother. And my sister was 19. And my sister could escape, but he says, \u201cNo way, I go where my mother goes.\u201d And I had that guilt feeling that I wanted to commit suicide because of that, too. Because we were so close.

My mother, I remember she made our clothes, everything, she sewed alone by hand. We didn\u2019t have even a machine, a sewing machine. But she tried the best and she tried to brought us up that we were really, everybody who spoke about us... and there are only two people in Brooklyn, who knew my parents from my childhood, only two people, two friends I have, who knew them and how they are talking about them. It\u2019s terrible. One lived in Prague, she got married and then they came to America and her husband was a dermatologist and then he got Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Anyway. So, she, we became, we are still friends, but now telephone friends. We are talking. And she has two very successful children, unbelievable. He\u2019s a dentist. Middle of New York, he has an office. But they came after the Czech revolution that was in the sixties. They came with everything, with furniture, with Steinway piano. They brought everything with them. Oriental carpets. Not as we came, because they didn\u2019t let us take nothing with us when we came. But only two people. And it\u2019s so sad that only two people knew my parents. You know? It\u2019s unbelievable. Of course... no, my cousin, he doesn\u2019t... in Canada, he doesn\u2019t remember. My cousin in Budapest, she remembers my parents. She was younger than my sister. She\u2019s younger than my sister was, but she is remembering my parents. But otherwise, no one remembers my parents. It\u2019s very sad. And I don\u2019t know about my grandchildren. I wrote down everything. They have it on tape and still they are very mixed up when I speak about an aunt, you see, we have somebody by the name of Ilou (ph), what was a sister-in-law of my aunt, but they have the same name. Because that was a second marriage to my uncle\u2019s brother. And the name was the same Ilou and Ilia (ph). But the other one, the older one, she is not mixing it up. She knows the difference, who was Ilika (ph) to us and who is Ilou, she knows. Ilou she knows, she was here too. She\u2019s alive. That was my uncle\u2019s sister-in-law by second marriage, because the first wife died with the four year old little boy. And he always wanted children, so he married a younger woman than him and she couldn\u2019t have never children. But she has a big family in Israel. She has a brother and she has a sister-in-law in Montreal, because her brother died when they came to Canada. When we came here, they went to Canada. And he was a paper (ph) engineer. He wasn\u2019t used to Canadian winter, slippery. And he made a car accident and he got a stroke from it. And he didn\u2019t die, but he got a second stroke and he died. And he was a young man. He was 42, something like that and he left his wife and his young eight years old son in Canada. And the wife had a German nana. She was a real German, wonderful, wonderful person, from her childhood. Because she had very, very wealthy parents, and she had a sister, she died, too. And her parents died, but that woman, she stayed with her all through her life. And she was bringing up her son, too. And then she died in Canada. She never went back. She was from Vienna. Very nice person. I remember her so well. I met her many times when we went to Canada. First they lived in Montreal and they moved to Toronto when the French started that you had to speak French.

There were many, many, even in my class, there were three twins. Can you imagine? There were many twins, girls. And, but they were good friends.

            "answer": "It is a Zionist organization, yes, and it was a youth organization. And in the summer we made excursions, but only for one day, in the mountains together. It was a very nice life in Czechoslovakia. The Czech people are wonderful people and that was the real democracy. What I lived under, Masaryk and Benes (ph), that was a real democracy. And I am laughing when I am talking here about democracy. I says, \u201cDo those people know what\u2019s democracy?\u201d You know, there are castes here and everywhere. And even in the hospital... I worked 27 years in Brooklyn Jewish Hospital. And there were very few people who were really, as you say, mensch people. Like it was a old doctor, he was the head of the Pediatrics. He was the only one who went there in the morning and he shook hands with the elevator guy and something like that. You know? It was... it was entirely different. They speak here about democracy, but they don\u2019t know what it is. I remember that once before, my husband... my father had many jobs before they had, they bought a... I don\u2019t know what year was it. They bought together a drugstore. But drugstore, it means, because they didn\u2019t have their diploma or certificate. And I have my own diploma, Russian diploma. So when he came to America, he worked in New York in a pharmacy, in a German pharmacy, and he was the head of the Herbs department. They sell many, many. But he couldn\u2019t do a prescription. And that was the situation with my father, too, when they went to Czechoslovakia. So they bought a drugstore, but they had everything but prescription drugs. But they didn\u2019t have luncheonettes like here. It was no such a thing. But the trouble was, then they separated and a pharmacist died. And it was a beautiful new pharmacy. And his wife wanted my father to work for her. Okay. He took over and he was substituting outside. He knew pharmacists and when they were for vacation, he was substituting in the pharmacy. He knows, he did everything. And then when he took over that pharmacy and my uncle had the drugstore. And it was a big place and a small place, because everybody knew everybody. So if somebody went to my uncle, they were... they felt bad that they don\u2019t go to my father. That kind of a situation, you know? It was very bad. So on the end, he had to leave that pharmacy and he went back with my uncle, together, because, you know, there were lot of Russian people. They were non-Jews, lots. And they knew all each other. And one, oh, especially one, who let me go to the office. He had a very big position and he let me go to the office and learn the Russian typewriter. That\u2019s how I knew how to type Russian. But it came very, very good after the war, when I worked for the dictionaries. I was the only one who typed Russian in Hungary. So they were all friends, non-Jews and Jews, the Russians. Of course, they were all educated people. I\u2019m not saying that the others were because probably they were anti- Semitic, like, you know. Like it always was anti-Semitism in Russia. But they were very good friends. I never forget it, that one Christmas night, she said, \u201c\u201cYou must come to our church.\u201d It\u2019s very interesting, the Russian Orthodox church.\u201d There, it was interesting.

It was a church where you didn\u2019t have seats, you know? You were all standing and he was like the leader there or whatever. And everybody who came in got three kisses, you know. Three times you kiss. Very friendly, very, very friendly. They were very, very nice people. And then I remember it was a photographer, Kantor (ph) was his name. And I don\u2019t know how he survived, because he was Jewish. And he survived, I don\u2019t know how. They sent him back with the non-Jews. And then my friends from Brooklyn, who knew them too, and they were in California and they met him. He was alive for a long time and he met their sons.

He came and he said, \u201cI am going to adopt the children.\u201d\u201d Under eighteen he could have done it. \u201cAnd just the name will change. They can\u2019t stay with you. Just God forbid something happens that the children should be safe.\u201d\u201d And I remember the day that they called us and they called us in the bedroom, my father and my mother and him. And they explained it to us and we started to cry. We thought that we are going to be taken away from them. And we couldn\u2019t understand it. Why? Why? Why? Though I was 18 years old in 1938. But I just, we just... to take another name, and... they didn\u2019t explain it to us, that what can happen. You know? Though we knew the story. We knew the story, but we didn\u2019t think about it, that my father was never led back to Hungary. Only my mother and us, every summer. He never was let back to Hungary to go back. And suddenly he\u2019s traveling to Hungary, because Hungary is, we are Hungary. And so after big, big discussions, we decided that we won\u2019t do it. We children didn\u2019t want to do it. And that costed my sister\u2019s life. But my sister could be saved, and he didn\u2019t want because... originally when they went to that cousin, she wanted to take my sister away, right away when she saw what\u2019s going to happen, what\u2019s happening.

She went to the camps, too. So probably my sister, if she would take my sister, she wouldn\u2019t be alive anyway.

So she said, \u201cIt\u2019s enough, one person.\u201d She was converted, she was married in a Christian church with popes, papers that she can get married. Her daughter was born already as Christian. And he loved his parents and he loved his mother and after four years he left the girl. The girl wanted to commit suicide. It was a country girl. They had a restaurant there. Because when he was living there with the same business in smaller... it was small town and he had his little farm alone and horse and everything. And he lived alone there. And then he wanted to get rid of her because of his mother and he came to Budapest. And once he came, she came after him, but I never met her. But he was telling me that she came after him because she was so in love with him. So anyway, so that was the story that he fell in love with me. You know? She left... so, then I found out the story I says, \u201cOh, how do I trust him, if that\u2019s the story?\u201d Because he left one, then he wants to marry me. Well, anyway. So we went out and it was already, I finished my cure and it was already war. My uncle was already in America with the last ship and in \u201841 it was already bad. And we went out for a dinner and he brought his friend with him, who was in the same business. And we went to a restaurant and people are looking in the papers for the news. It was no television, radios were, but no televisions. And he took a paper and he\u2019s looking in a paper and I am asking him something and he didn\u2019t hear me. And this way I did with my hand and I turned to his friend. That he saw, that I waved and he took me home that night and I didn\u2019t see him for three weeks. He thought that I did it, that I don\u2019t care about him. He was so sensitive, but I didn\u2019t know that. For three weeks I didn\u2019t see him. The third week, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d I said to his aunt, because we were very close, even we lived very close. And I said it to his cousin that I\u2019m going home. And he says, \u201cWhy, what happened?\u201d I says, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. I didn\u2019t hear from him and that\u2019s it.\u201d He went home to his mother, then his mother was telling me... I met his mother, very nice lady, she was very nice. I met his parents.

Because I remember what my father wrote, that he\u2019s giving his crown of his life to him and he should take care of her, that kind of a style, you know. And we agreed that my engagement will be third of July in my grandmother\u2019s house. Because we don\u2019t have my uncle anymore there and that those relatives were not so close relatives that we should make an engagement. Our family was always, my family, my mother\u2019s family was always the family. It was arranged everything, it was a Sunday and the whole family was together, the sisters and everything. I remember a beautiful table was made and my parents, my sister should come up to the engagement and they never came. That story you know.

And they said, \u201cProbably they are looking for you,\u201d because they knew everything, everything who was not a citizen. Because we weren\u2019t Hungarian citizens. The papers were at the police. That was the police. And they knew that you were four people and they got only three people, so you better go to hiding. So, I couldn\u2019t get married, because he was already in labor camp, too, from 1941 on. But that time he was home still. With the... he was in the Hungarian uniform, he was so gorgeous. He was an officer. And he... we couldn\u2019t get married, because in Hungary we couldn\u2019t get married. Only when we were 24 years old without the father\u2019s consent, at that time. Can you imagine? Today you can get married if you are ten years old, I think. So, he went, short, right after, they stripped him of his uniform and he went to labor camp. And I stayed there with my grandmother and every night, I slept somewhere else. Some other relatives and by his friends, because everything happened during the night, that they were looking for people."

And my, the youngest sister of my mother, IIllie, ona, they found out that they brought up a lot of, a transport from Uzhorod to Budapest and they put them like in a jail.

And my mother told them that I shouldn\u2019t come there, because I look like her and it has no sense that I should be there, because they are going to get out from there. And one day they let out my father with a policeman for money to my cousin\u2019s house, who was in Siberia. He lived very close to that place and he wasn\u2019t home already, just his wife.

And he said, \u201cAre you sure, are you sure?\u201d And worried about me. I says, \u201cI am not sure of nothing, but I hope it will be all right.\u201d And he said, I said, \u201cLook, my aunt knows his aunt and they know the family, so I hope it will be all right.\u201d And he called up from Uzhorod, he called Uzhorod and he called up the senators. They were all Russians. There were many Russians, they were non-Jews in Uzhorod. And he knew everybody. And they told him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, tomorrow you\u2019ll be out.\u201d And we parted and he says, \u201cI hope we see each other tomorrow.\u201d And tomorrow came and my aunt and even my husband, he wasn\u2019t my husband at that time, my aunt and her husband, they all went to the train station, because they said the people are going to go home by train to Uzhorod. Everybody went back, who was non-Jew. The Jews went in separate cars to Kamana Spodovski (ph), where they killed them. And my husband, he had a very, very soft heart, like him. And he couldn\u2019t even, he couldn\u2019t see the scene. Though they went with regular cars, not like with cattle cars, but with police and whatever, soldiers, Hungarian soldiers. He run away. He couldn\u2019t see it. He just saw them from a distance. And I think my sister recognized him. I don\u2019t know. That was that. And then a few weeks, about two weeks later, I got a card from my sister, in my sister\u2019s handwriting, that \u201c\u201cWe are in Kamana Spodovski (ph). We don\u2019t know what are we going to do here. We don\u2019t know if we are going to have where to stay, but we are here.\u201d And it was a Hungarian stamp on it, so it means that a Hungarian soldier brought it back. And what I know from the museum, that\u2019s why I went this Spring to the museum, I told you that. To find out the truth. Because she went first, my daughter-in-law, and asked about it, and met there somebody in the library, who was very nice. And she, he showed her the book and he took out a few pages from the book and he made copies for me. And he sent it to me. He even spoke to me over the phone when my sister, when my daughter-in-law was there. And he said, it wasn\u2019t that time that they killed them. I always thought that they killed them when they left in July. When I was there, I looked at the book, but I couldn\u2019t buy it. It\u2019s such a big book. It was not only about them, because, he said, they said, and it\u2019s here and it\u2019s terrible, that 38 thousand people were killed in one day, because they didn\u2019t know what to do with them. Because they took them to Poland and the Polish people were already in ghettos that time. So they couldn\u2019t help them. Nobody could help them. And the Germans didn\u2019t know what to do with them, so they let them made their own grave, naked, like us in Auschwitz. They took the clothes away, they put them on one line and on the orders. They made a big, big grave and they had to make the grave. And from the other side, the German soldiers were shooting them in the graves and right away, the tanks were running over them. So I wanted that book, but it was no sense, because it was from... I have the pages what I needed. And I see the pictures how they sit there on the end of the, the forest. And the people... and I saw the... I told you about that 12 series what was on television, The Winds of War? You never heard about The Winds of War? Mitchum played in it. It started only four series. It was a beautiful movie. It was a French-Jewish writer, who was in France and his niece was with him. You don\u2019t know that story? It\u2019s Winds of War, is the name. It\u2019s in the public library. After that they made a 12 series, 12 two hours, 12 times, the whole summer and I saw all of it. It was a Hungarian, originally he was Hungarian, an actor. And his father was amongst those people who were taken and that was his idea to make that movie. You see original pictures what the Germans took. Because it starts out like a colored movie and suddenly it\u2019s black and white pictures. And you see the trains what we went in and I couldn\u2019t look. I said, \u201cI see myself somewhere there.\u201d But when I saw, I saw the whole thing, how they killed them. And then I really couldn\u2019t look, because I said, \u201cMy God, I am going to  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

That was the treatment. And that was... I thought it was a heart attack, because it didn\u2019t want to go out. For three weeks it didn\u2019t go down, the pulse. And then I had another thing in 1942, that was terrible too. I had the appendix taken out and I couldn\u2019t have it done under my name. I didn\u2019t go to the hospital. And I went with my mother\u2019s, with my mother\u2019s oldest sister, whose son was in Siberia. And I went under her name to the hospital. It was a private hospital. And the doctor was a private doctor, who, he was a gynecologist. Because I was constantly complaining about pain and pain and pain and pain and he just couldn\u2019t find out what is it. And one day my husband was there visiting. It wasn\u2019t my husband at that time. And I just was like in two, I had such a pain. And his office was in my, my grandmother, where my grandmother lived, in that house was his office. And I went to him and I said, \u201cI tell you the diagnosis. I tell you what I have.\u201d He says, \u201cWhat, what are you talking about?\u201d I said, \u201cThat must be appendix.\u201d And he says, \u201cGod, you are right.\u201d And he took me to a private hospital to Budapest and they started to operate on me. And it was under my aunt\u2019s name. I was Halas (ph). That\u2019s his grandson is Halas, who is in Canada. And I went under that name. And the operation was so long, they didn\u2019t know what happened there, that the doctors are running for more anesthesia. And my aunt is standing there and didn\u2019t know what happened. My appendix was completely, completely curled up with my colons and it was a very, very long operation. And my heart, it was weak. They took me home by ambulance after. But next morning, six o\u2019clock in the morning, the doctor is there. And he lived, that was in Budapest, in the city, the hospital. And we lived in New Pest, so it was a big distant. I says, \u201cI am so sick that you are here?\u201d He says, \u201cNo, no, don\u2019t worry. I just wanted to know how you feel.\u201d Then I found out what was happening and they had to take me home by ambulance. And it was in \u201842. And in \u201844 I have an unusual big cut and that\u2019s how I went to Mengele. So I thought that that will matter when he sees that. But you know what was interesting? That I had a friend, she was a woman, who had a mastectomy and she survived. And Mengele saw it and she survived. So they were very odd things. And she came to Canada and she died in Canada. It was a terrible thing. Her son is an engineer. He and my cousin, in Hungary, they went together to the... they started the engineering college together. Her son and my cousin, who is in Canada, that lady\u2019s son. And they lived in Montreal. And my cousin lived in Montreal at the beginning. He went to McGill (ph) to finish his degree. And we went to visit her, the lady, and she was alive for a few years. And once her son had to go to Paris, to France for business. I don\u2019t know what kind of engineer is he, because mine is a chemical engineer. I don\u2019t know what kind of engineer he... and while he was away, she got the pneumonia and she died. They had to call him home. She lived together with the son and with daughter-in-law. She married a Hungarian girl. He wasn\u2019t Jewish. She was Jewish, the woman. Her husband wasn\u2019t Jewish, so the son wasn\u2019t Jewish. So she married a Hungarian, non-Jewish girl, who was already in Canada at that ttme. And she spoke perfect French and she worked for the telephone company. Very nice person. We went there three times to visit her. And for longest time, they couldn\u2019t... he retired. They couldn\u2019t sell their house. And two years ago they wrote me a letter, \u201cFinally we sold the house and we moved to Kingston.\u201d It\u2019s Canada, but it\u2019s very close to the border. And it\u2019s a beautiful place.

And the girl, she was a, they wanted a child very badly and finally she became pregnant and she was a premature baby. And she was very small, so they didn\u2019t know that she survive.

And I was surprised how he was talking to him over the phone. I says, \u201cMarie,\u201d her name is Anna Maria, \u201ceverybody can hear you.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care. My mother comes first,\u201d and that kind of a thing. So, he kept her alive, really. My husband went to see her every year, and that year when he went, in \u201882, in \u201881, February, he had a heart attack, and he lived 17 months. And in \u201882, June, he says, \u201cI\u2019m going to see my sister.\u201d And I spoke, I knew that three-quarter of his heart was gone. And I spoke to his doctor, I says, \u201cWhat should I do? How shall I tell him that he cannot go?\u201d He says, \u201cYou know what, he can go. He has a doctor there. He will be safe. But he cannot go rowing around nowhere in Europe. He goes to one place and he can go. And June 13\" is his birthday, but I called him many times. But I called him on his birthday. I\u2019m sorry, June 17. He was born, 1913, 17. And I called him and he says, \u201cI feel wonderful. I feel very good,\u201d and I always gave the report to the doctor, because he was from the same hospital were I worked, the doctor. And he says, \u201cYes, he has around him more sick people than he is, so he\u2019s feeling fine.\u201d\u2019 And he came home and every first of July, we went out to the country house. They were there already, here in 1979. And we met there and I spend one week vacation there, because Ilona was born third of July. And we spend her birthday. And my husband came back end of June to spend the week in the country for her birthday. And after that, we supposed to go to Canada, all of us by car. And he said, \u201cYou know what? I came from a big trip. You go with them to Canada.\u201d And she was pregnant with Anna that time. She was pregnant with Anna, Ilona. She knew that he wanted, because he always wanted children and the two died. He always wanted children, so at least George should have more children. So she was pregnant with her, and we went to Canada. He said, \u201cYou go to Canada and I go home.\u201d And he was alone, traveling home. And then I got a call from him in Canada that please bring a present to one of my co-workers. I says, \u201cWhy to her?\u201d She says, \u201cBecause I was sick and she took me to the hospital.\u201d So we packed and we  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I was working and after work I went to the dentist and I had to have a tooth pulled. And he was very upset about that and he came with me. I went by bus. They had private buses, because I went to the city periodontist. And he came to the door and he looked so beautiful. He had brown pants and a yellow shirt on. And he said, \u201cNothing, nothing hurts me,\u201d because he had back trouble, too. He had a spine operation.

So, she was the one who was unbelievably helping me. And then the last year, before the Nazis came in, she didn\u2019t let me go to hiding and she said, \u201cYou are our child, no matter what. You stay with us.\u201d And so for one year I was with them until they took us all. And after, when she survived and I survived and her husband survived, but not her son. And my son was born. To my son she was like a grandmother. So when we left, we left to Vienna and we left them in Hungary, but we knew that they are coming after us, three weeks. Because they had, they were elderly people already and they had visa to Israel and England and we knew that they are going to come. And the time came then we came to America and we left them there. And my son, he was so blaming me and he was so crying. How can I do it, to leave them there? He was nine years old. He was the only relative whom he knew. Like, she took care of him when I had to go to work. Because under the communism we had to work. And she was everything to him. And my heart was going out and I was explaining to him, \u201cWhen we get to America and we become citizens we are going to bring...\u201d and that was the plan, that we are going to bring them over. But she died, unfortunately, from a gall bladder operation. But I think that she had already liver cancer, but they don\u2019t tell me, because nobody dies from a gall bladder operation. It must have gone to the liver and the operation was okay. She was alive for a few days. And one day my uncle and his brother went to visit her. They went every day, but one day when they went, she was dead. I didn\u2019t go, to the funeral. Because we were here in \u201858 and that was in \u00b063 and in \u201859 I got a job in the hospital when I was working and I says, \u201cWe don\u2019t have either the money for the three of us to go,\u201d so we couldn\u2019t go. But it was in the summertime and George was with some of our friends in the country. They were having a bungalow they rented and we went over on the weekends. We went to Poughkeepsie. And he was there and I was afraid to tell him. I was afraid to tell him. And he wrote to his pediatrician in New York, who was the head of the Pediatrics in the hospital where I worked, and asked him to find out from me the truth, because he thinks that something is very wrong. And he showed me the letter and he said, \u201cYou have to tell him.\u201d So, I was very, very upset to tell him. And I found it out, my husband did, he got the letter and he didn\u2019t want to tell me. And we are driving out to the country and when he told me, we made an accident with the car. I was, you know, so upset, we made... and it was an old car and we had the first car. It was a big Pontiac. But somebody ran into us. It wasn\u2019t our fault, and he ran away. The guy ran away. But I was so upset that how I am going to tell him, because it was like the end of the world. He didn\u2019t know no one from the family and he was the kid of the family, because his brother, my uncle\u2019s brother lost his four-years-old child and the second wife never could have children. So he\u2019s named after my, Ilika\u2019s son, he was George, too. And he was everybody\u2019s child, only child. And when I had the other little boy, he was five months old when he died. I named him after the four-years-old, who died. He was Paul, he was Paul, my little one, who died in one day from the croup."

I got in touch with my uncle, here in America. And he wanted us very badly, but it was no way that we... maybe old people got visas already at that time to Israel, but young people didn\u2019t. And we were young people, so it was impossible. And then in \u201849, I had the other boy, so I didn\u2019t even think about it that we should go anyplace, to try. And we didn\u2019t have a bad life until it was really communism. Because I had a maid, sleep-in maid. I didn\u2019t have to work. And in 1948 when it was really communism, I had to let her go, the girl, and I had to go to work. Because everybody had to show what they are living from, because my husband was in private business and he couldn\u2019t show how much he is making. And he made nice money. But I had to go to work."

It was very hard for him to get a job on his profession, but then later on he got a job. He got a job later on, but it was not a state job. It was again private. He went together with somebody and they had... he was actually, he finished business college, but actually what was his business before the war, he was [laughing], I have to always laugh that we eat the oats, because that they gave to horses in Hungary. And he was in that business, feeding, oat feeding, because everything was horses, not cars. The transportation was horses and it was a big business, the animal food for the horses.

I had a beautiful case and it was everything silver in it, because we couldn\u2019t show the money. We couldn\u2019t put it in the bank or something. And then they didn\u2019t bother us. They bother us in one way: that we had a big apartment. Because when my aunt\u2019s apartment was ready, they renovated it, we moved in, in the old apartment and it was a very big one. I mean large rooms, there were three large rooms. And actually the fourth one was a room, too, the foyer, because we had furniture in there. And we had a kitchen and bathroom and we had a room for the maid from the kitchen. And the third room was a very big, it was so big that George when he was little, he could bicycle init. That was his room. And they took away from us that room. You know? And they made an apartment from it, a one-bedroom apartment. And they put in a family, only with one son. A family with one son. It was so big that they made kitchen, bedroom, bathroom... I don\u2019t know, I never went in, what is it. They were our neighbors. But otherwise, we didn\u2019t have trouble.  They took away the business of my uncle. He had 40 pairs of horses and two big trucks. They were the first ones, because they were in... in... how do you call it, that business, when people moved. It\u2019s a moving, not moving, actually it\u2019s not moving. But with the horses, too, they were renting it or whatever, to companies. And very, very big business. 40 pairs. And when it happened, they took my husband and he worked for them. He loved horses, that was his life, the horses, horseback riding actually. He loved it. And so he worked for them. But then they took away the business from them, from my uncle, so he had to... they didn\u2019t work anymore because they were elderly people.

            "answer": "Joseph. And when Elie Wiesel was here about, that\u2019s now four, five... Ilona was a senior, that\u2019s four years ago. Four years ago, he was here in Lexington and he had a wonderful, wonderful speech. It was the Jewish Federation and the UK, they did it together. And it was in UK, in the Memorial Hall. Before that, they had a dinner in the club, but it was 150 dollars a plate, and I didn\u2019t have 150 dollars for a dinner. And people were coming out and they were telling him what a wonderful thing it was just to shake hands with him. And I was very upset that I know that man from my co-worker, who was a very good friend, her father was very good friend, her husband, of Elie Wiesel and I couldn\u2019t see him. I couldn\u2019t talk to him. So when it was everything over, Ana was telling me, \u201cWait, wait, maybe you can see it, go to his dressing room.\u201d So, a gentleman was standing there from UK, they didn\u2019t let nobody to see him. And I went there. It was the rabbi\u2019s wife, that time, Rabbi Slaten\u2019s (ph) wife, and she was talking for me. And she says, \u201cWould you let that lady in only for a few minutes? She is the only survivor here in Lexington and she would like to talk to him, only for a few minutes.\u201d So he says, \u201cYes, I will do it, but she has to wait until the hall is empty, because if people see somebody\u2019s going, they want to go, too.\u201d So, I was waiting, I says, \u201cI gladly wait.\u201d So, I was waiting and he helped me down the steps, because they were wooden steps in the basement. It was the... I couldn\u2019t believe it. He says, \u201cYes, we are hiding people.\u201d [Laughing.] And it was nothing to hold onto and they were wooden steps and he was helping me to go down. And suddenly I came and the door is open and he\u2019s standing there. He was a very, very attractive man. And my heart was beating, that I couldn\u2019t say nothing, so I says, \u201cHello.\u201d He was very friendly. I says, \u201cHello.\u201d He says, \u201cWho are you?\u201d I didn\u2019t say even my name, I was so excited. I says, \u201cI am a Holocaust survivor and I am the only one here.\u201d He says, \u201cIf you are a Holocaust survivor, you must be from Europe.\u201d I says, \u201cYes.\u201d He says, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d I says, \u201cBudapest.\u201d He says, \u201cBudapest?\u201d And he starts to talk to me, Hungarian. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I said, \u201cYou speak still Hungarian?\u201d Because he didn\u2019t, I mean, I don\u2019t know where he learned, because where he was, they were very religious people, his parents. And I think they spoke Yiddish and not Hungarian, but he spoke Hungarian. And he was 15 years old, maybe in school, correct, in school, probably he learned. He spoke wonderful.

I says, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me, you speak Hungarian.\u201d And from then on he spoke Hungarian to me. And he asked me where I know him from. And I mentioned his friend\u2019s name. And he says, \u201cKorman! (ph)\u201d He says, \u201cI saw him last week!\u201d That\u2019s what he\u2019s telling me. I says, \u201cYes, because of you he didn\u2019t want to retire to Florida, because he was often...\u201d he lives in New York, actually, and teaches in Boston. And they had from that part of the town, Sighet (ph), they had an organization. And that my friend\u2019s husband went always there because he loved him. And she then was telling me what went on in that organization and what happened at that organization [laughing] when they were together, so I knew a lot about him. And I was telling it to him. He says, \u201cBecause of you, he didn\u2019t want to move to Florida.\u201d He says, \u201cYou know what? I saw him in Florida.\u201d When he was down in Florida, he saw him. So he was very nice, and then he says, what I am doing, and I told him that I am talking in schools, and he says, \u201cWonderful.\u201d He says, \u201cWhat grade are you starting?\u201d I says, \u201cSixth.\u201d He says, \u201cThat\u2019s the right grade to start, don\u2019t do younger ones.\u201d But I did, because they were begging me. Lexington School for five graders. Ana went to SCAPA, they were four graders. They were begging me, especially in SCAPA, they were very smart kids. And here too, in Lexington School, they are very, very... I spoke twice already there. And now I, the teacher was always asking me whether I know a book for children. I am reading now in a magazine that he, Elie Wiesel, wrote his first children\u2019s book about the Holocaust with pictures. So, I try to get that book and I try to call that teacher in Lexington School, because she 1s very intelligent. She is teaching fifth graders. And they understood it. What kind of letters I got from them, from the fifth... I just cannot believe it, how they understood it and how sorry they are for me. And they cannot believe it, that I lived through that. Fifth graders. So I tell you the truth, that I spoke about 150, 160 times since Iam here. That if I cannot do it, because I will be the most unhappiest person in the world, because I feel the commitment that I have to do it. I still have to do it, because there are many, many people, who don\u2019t know it still and those are adults, mostly adults. The children are starting to know me in schools, because I go back always, because they are different classes, and most of them they know. In the colleges, too. I was all over in every college, Berea, Midway, and the private college, Transylvania, twice, UK three times. Community college. So, they know all ready. But the adults, lot of adults, in churches, they don\u2019t know. So, I will be really... and even if they call me to schools, next graders who didn\u2019t hear me and I cannot do it, I am depressed and I always think about it. That it give me... I cannot explain it, when I talk, I am very enthusiastic and I live it through again. That\u2019s true. And I have to take a tranquilizer, I must take before I go. And I never spoke about my parents, because I couldn\u2019t. I was always crying. And lately I am even showing the pictures of my parents. And if they give me enough time to tell them that story on the end, I am including it, what happened to them and I am showing their pictures. And I was so relieved that I did it. Okay, I didn\u2019t sleep at night, but I was relieved that I did something good for them who died. You know? I took it in my head that they died and they won\u2019t be at peace until the last survivor is going to tell their story. It\u2019s... I cannot explain it, what happened to me, because I never spoke. I never spoke."

And she had a son, an engineer and he didn\u2019t live home and she had three rooms, two bedrooms and a living room. One bedroom was separate and then she had a room in Bolotow (ph), near Lake Bolotow (ph), that she went there. If she rented the apartment she went there, that she shouldn\u2019t be home.

I took the mail, and a letter came from Israel. And when I gave it to her, she right away put it in her pocket. Because she knew that my sister-in-law was converted and married to a non-Jew and she got that apartment and she thought we are not Jewish. She was afraid to say that she is Jewish.

He doesn\u2019t remember it, so I am not telling it to him. And I am not telling it even to the grandchildren. Ana is crazy when she would hear it. She\u2019s watching always what you are ordering. She is... yeah. But he was the president of the synagogue, my uncle, and he was helping many, many Jewish, young boys to go to Israel. That time it was secret. Secretly, they went through Czechoslovakia. So, that way he was religious, but, you know? But we couldn\u2019t show it that we were religious or not religious. But we ate pork. But I got back my religion. I got my belief. I got it back slowly, slowly I got it back. I was always thinking about my mother, how he taught us, she taught us to pray in Czechoslovakia. And when we went to the synagogue like Friday night or something, I was always thinking about it, how we were crying, but every week we had to read one more page. And it was so hard for us, myself and my sister. And I was thinking about them. And as I was thinking about them always, you know, I got back my religion. And especially when I came to America. When I came to America and my uncle was... he wasn\u2019t, he ate everything. I\u2019m not saying that they didn\u2019t cook pork, but he was religious. And I remember him and my father when they were together and Passover, when they were together. And every Saturday they went to the synagogue and then they came to us and they were singing after lunch those songs that you are supposed to. And when I thought about those things it came back to me, you know? It\u2019s very interesting. And now I love to go to the synagogue, and I am so heartbroken. I wasn\u2019t there now three weeks, I think. I am missing it. And I\u2019m missing it. We don\u2019t have a rabbi now. He left. I loved him. It\u2019s interesting that he\u2019s near Cincinnati and Ilona was teaching here Sunday school art for four years. And now he\u2019s teaching in his new... she goes down to the new congregation and she\u2019s teaching, but only twice a month because it\u2019s 40 miles away. So, and it\u2019s, but... she sees him.

The Jews are always the [laughing]... for everywhere and everything they are blaming the Jews. So, it\u2019s no answer. It\u2019s no answer. First the Blacks came and after that the Jews. Some places they... when they are no Blacks, there are no Blacks, then there are the Jews the first who are blamed for everything. Why? Does anybody knows why\u201d? I lived under democracy in Czechoslovakia. It was a real, real democracy. Nobody knows what\u2019s democracy. Only if somebody lived under that time Masaryk and Benes. They always said, \u201cWe cannot be anti-Semitic, never. Because we have the brain, and we are businessmen and we are everything what the Jews are.\u201d So I was thinking about it, that it\u2019s jealousy. It was jealousy from Hitler that they, he took it from... they were supporting him, the Jews in Germany. They made him big. And then when he knew what they are doing and why, then they killed them and he wanted to have it. Why are they anti, I don\u2019t know, anti-Semitic here, I don\u2019t know. I never heard it from no one, but I can imagine that the Southern Baptist are anti-Semitic. I am thinking it only because I was invited [laughing] to every church, every denomination, but never to a Baptist church. So it must be something against the Jews. They won\u2019t say it to your face, but it must be. They know it. They saw me in the paper. They know it. And I was never, never, and I was on every Christian church. What is that?

We worked and we were communist, but we worked. I mean, the wealthy people were very afraid and we were very afraid with my uncle, that they are going to take them. Because they came at night. They knocked on the doors, and taked people on they, on their cars, on their... the Russians, with machine guns. And they took them to villages, and they took them to villages and they left them. There were certain villages where they were designated where they took the wealthy people. And they couldn\u2019t come back to Budapest. But thank God, thank God it never happened. Because that was against... again, it was somebody had to tell them who are the wealthy people. And they were in very good friendship with everybody from the higher-ups there. Because that was a borough, New Pest, where we lived. And like New York has five boroughs, the same thing Budapest has. And so they knew everybody, and they were friends with everybody, and so nobody told on them, so they weren\u2019t taken away. Their business was taken away, but they didn\u2019t. They weren\u2019t taken away. What was done to them, they had to move together, the two families, in one apartment, because it was too big for two people. Gorgeous apartment. House. And they took away they apartment and they had to live together, the sister-in-laws and brother- in-law, two brothers. And they had to rent the upstairs apartment. They decided that they\u2019d take the first floor and the second floor, it was a doctor, a gynecologist with his family. But they didn\u2019t take them out. And from that, that they take out many wealthy people, many wealthy people married non-Jews, but not that non-Jews, but it wasn\u2019t a match. Just only because those people were giving them stay, somewhere to stay. Because it is an example, my cousin, I have a second cousin in Budapest, my mother and her mother were sisters, cousins. I\u2019m sorry, first cousins. And she is the only one who survived from that family, nobody. She had two uncles and the grandmothers were sisters, my grandmother and her grandmother were sisters and that\u2019s how the mothers were first cousins, my mother and her mother. And she was an only child and the only survivor. She survived. Her parents put her in a factory. I didn\u2019t tell you all that? I don\u2019t know. To a factory where they were making like General Electric. They were making light bulbs. It was Tungsraum (ph), it was a very well known company. I think, in fact, now after the war, they are together, Tungsraum and General Electric. Something, I don\u2019t know. But young girls, they worked there. And when they took her parents, she was working there and they slept there and everything. So they worked for the army and when they finished with the work, when the work was finished, they let them go. But they didn\u2019t have where to go, because they were, nobody was there already, we were all gone. And that\u2019s... I think I, somewhere I said that story, that she was hiding. One of her aunts had a maid and she recommended where to go, to a woman, who was non-Jewish and her husband was Jewish and he was in labor camp. And she had a house. And she took in about eight people, Jewish people. It was a doctor, it was my cousins and her boyfriend and I don\u2019t know, about eight people. And she was hiding them. I told that story?  ",

And the tanks were turned towards us. The end was so close to us. Every minute, or when we are standing for bread, the tanks were turned always to shoot us. It was terrible. Then, one day, I don\u2019t know what happened... not one day, they did it many times. But they were very close to us and they were shooting during the night. And we were in the apartment and basements were on the other side of the building, the basements, and we had to run to the other side with the children. I had at that time my cousin\u2019s, who was in Russia, his two daughters. They were with us because they went somewhere for vacation and it happened under the vacation. And they lived far, very far from us. They lived in Buda, what was very far from us and they couldn\u2019t pick up the children. And they stayed with us, two little girls. We had to go to the basement because they were shelling in the backyard. Terrible. I don\u2019t know how many nights we spent in the basement. When it stopped, when they already were in control, I don\u2019t know how long it took them. It took them a long time, and they were in control. Then Austria opened the borders, their borders and people who lived close, they could just walk over to Austria. And thousands and thousands, and mostly the peasants, because they were all farmlands around the border, you know? They went all over to Austria and in Austria they put up camps for them and America was sending money for it. We were far away, we couldn\u2019t go, because we were 400 miles away from the border, in Budapest. So we couldn\u2019t go. That story is in. How did I get out, and the Russians. That\u2019s in."

But he knew I\u2019m alive. He knew, because he knew months ago already when they got the notice. But he was waiting for me. But I wasn\u2019t sure whether he has somebody in between or not, though we got married. We were married in 1944, in February, when we got married. For two weeks we were together and that was that. And I was always, you know, afraid that they are going to take me still. I am married, but we went to a hotel, I remember on the marriage night. It was unbelievable. We went down to eat. It was in the city, a beautiful hotel. And everybody constantly was afraid that they are coming and asking for identification and that kind of a thing. It was horrible. So I said, \u201cLet\u2019s check out. I don\u2019t want to stay here.\u201d We went back. We went back, and we stayed with my grandmother, and then we stayed with Ilika, too, with Ilona.

But that\u2019s from Ilona, so we called her Ilika. And I was Milika, my name was Millie, I mean my nickname is Millie. Nobody knew me as Emilie, only in school, and at work. But otherwise, the whole family and my friends... and then we came to America, I didn\u2019t know that it\u2019s an American name, too. And I never mentioned it. It was always Emilie and that was it. But my friends are still calling me Millie on the phone and my cousin and everybody is calling me. I have a cousin in Canada. My cousin who was eight years in Siberia, seven years, from \u201841 to \u201848. He hasason. And he escaped after \u201856, they sent him, the parents. He went to University at that time already, two years as an engineer. And he was, when he came back he was a communist. He wasn\u2019t a communist, he was in the party and because of that, that he was in Russia and spoke already Russian, he got a very big job in the Ministry. He was... as an engineer. He knew that he never can come to America, because he was in the Communist Party. So when it was finished, the communism, when the... I mean, when they opened the borders, he sent his son alone to Vienna. But he had to go to Israel, because the plan was that the parents are going to come after him to Israel. They knew that he cannot come to America. We weren\u2019t here. And so he went alone to Israel, but the mother had there a lot of friends, his mother, and he stayed with the friends. And he went to the Israeli Army and he was an officer, too. And the parents went after him, they got passport. Parents and two sisters, who were born after he came home, the two sisters. But he escaped with his mother\u2019s mother\u2014grandmother, grandfather and he\u2014they escaped the middle of Budapest. I don\u2019t know whether you heard about Wallenberg, that Swedish man?

And it is very interesting that his father was in the First World War and he got... he was in Siberia, too, his father. And he got a nerve disease, nerves. It was terrible. I remember him very well. That was my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s husband. And he got the same disease in Israel. He was a young man. He was 60, 62 when he died. And he got a job as an engineer, but in a different field. It was a margarine factory where he was in engineering, like making colognes and that kind of, you know? Entirely different. But they were okay.

Because the daughter was always hysterical and even from meetings she called him. He was in a hospital like here, Walter Reed. He was there, a pathologist, under the Communism. So, he had a big job.

Because she had diabetes, diabetes, I don\u2019t know whether it counts for me, that that family had diabetes, but my father\u2019s sister had diabetes in Russia. So it was in the family. I always forgot about it and when they were asking me, \u201cDid anybody have it in the family?\u201d And I always say, \u201cI don\u2019t know, they were killed when they were 45 years old.\u201d And I know my grandmother didn\u2019t have it. I know the other sister didn\u2019t have it. At that time I probably... I didn\u2019t know even that his sister had it, because she was writing, my father, always to his sister. And he translated the letters to us, but I didn\u2019t think about it, you know, that she had it. And now he was telling me, my cousin, that she had even a leg amputated because of diabetes. So it is in my family. But I don\u2019t know whether I got it. I don\u2019t know. Because it was really, I had such a good doctor for 27 years and he never said that\u2019s diabetes. Only my periodontist always said that I have diabetes because of my gums. It was always, he said, \u201cWhat are they talking about, you have diabetes?\u201d And he always said, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t have diabetes, it\u2019s just elevated because of the medications what you are taking.\u201d Here the urologist was arguing with me, that I don\u2019t have... I had urinary tract infection. And he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have diabetes. What are they talking about? Because it\u2019s not in your urine.\u201d Would you believe that? Well, anyway. So then, when we lived in Eger, and we started to know each other. And right away, I got pregnant, a month later I got pregnant. We got very close and he was a very, very good man. Very good. He had such a heart. He was so good. He never said, like George, he never said nothing bad about nobody. And he tried to help people and he was a person like, he worked in a hospital, and he... like nobody, you know... even in New York they don\u2019t care about the Blacks.

You think that I don\u2019t think about them?\u201d I says, \u201cYou go only to the stones. You must realize it, that you go only to the stones.\u201d He says, \u201cYes, but at least I can fix up the letters if they are, you know, not in shape.\u201d They are not buried separate. They are buried with my Uncle Joseph, in the same grave, the two little kids. And then that was that reason, that he has an only sister and she\u2019s very sick. And then when he was very sick, he had a terrible heart attack in \u201881 and in \u201882, 17 months he lived. And in between that he went to Hungary. I said to the doctor, \u201cWhat shall I tell him, that he cannot go?\u201d He says, \u201cNo, he can go, but he cannot go around nowhere else, just to Hungary. And he\u2019ll be all right there because his nephew is a doctor and he will be very safe there.\u201d And I called him every week on the phone. And he said, \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Three- quarters of his heart was gone. \u201cI am fine,\u201d he said. And I always gave the report to the doctor. And he says, \u201cHe\u2019s fine because probably he sees sicker people around him, and then he has the nephew there\u2019. And that was the reason, because when he came back in July, end of June... every July we were in the country for Ilona\u2019s, Ilona was born July 3\u2122 and I left a week vacation for that, and we went to the country house, and he came back before that and he came with us and he was fine. We wanted to go, all of us, to Canada after. It\u2019s not close, but it\u2019s on the same highway to go to Toronto, where it\u2019s close, like a country house. It was a long ride, but still it was... I don\u2019t know about four, 500 hundred miles, through Niagara Falls. We wanted to all of us go, and he said, \u201cYou know what? I came from a long trip now, I go home myself. I drive home myself. And you go with them.\u201d Laura was pregnant with Ana. And he was so happy, because he always wanted a lot of children. He was crazy for children. And George was an only child, because the two others died. And he always, he was very happy. He loved them so much. That\u2019s the last picture from them before he left. That was only Jacob and Ilona. And he... 1t was in April. No. No, because George took him to the airport. It was before he left. He died in \u201882. While we were in Canada, he got sick and he went himself to the hospital. They took him in Intensive Care, Coronary Care, I don\u2019t even know. But I called him when he was already home. And he said, \u201cBring a present to so and so.\u201d I says, \u201cWhy?\u201d He said, \u201cBecause he helped me. I was in the hospital.\u201d So right away I packed and I went back. And in August he died. I wasn\u2019t even around. You know that story? It was terrible. He was so good. And he was so worried about me, because when I was sick, he didn\u2019t get undressed. He was... the whole... because I had two heart attacks, in \u201867 and in \u201870. So, it was always me they were worried about. So, he was always, he didn\u2019t get undressed and he was... unbelievable nurse, you know? He was very, very good. And with the children, everything they... what we had, and every vacation they were always for those two children, because they lived upstairs. They lived in the same house. He loved them. He loved George. He loved them. He was very upset that he\u2019s an artist, because he thought that, he always of the Hungarian artist, and he was always telling them, \u201cYou know how the artists are living? They are going barefoot because they don\u2019t have money for they...\u201d [Laughing.] You know, he was always worried. But when he said that \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I am going to teach.\u201d Then he was very happy, and he was always the first one whom George called. That \u201cT got tenure, I got even...\u201d no, he wasn\u2019t alive when he got full professor, only when he got tenure. He was alive. And he was very happy, and with every exhibition, though he didn\u2019t like his paintings. But he said he loves it, because he went from that kind of a, ultra-modern. But he was supporting him. And that was everything for him, George was everything. That\u2019s why we bought the house there, that he should have a studio. But he always said to him, \u201cIf you want to  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I mean, he didn\u2019t have no one else but us, that was a family, so he wanted a family. So he got married. And he loves his children. He\u2019s a very good father, and he\u2019s very good to me, unbelievable good to me. And nobody can understand it."

            "answer": "His wife cannot understand it. And I, I... because they don\u2019t know what 1s it... we went once to a psychiatrist, because she was very jealous of his love towards me. She cannot, she cannot understand it that somebody can love two people different way. And the psychiatrist explained it to me. She would never understand it, because she never got along with her mother. She loved her father, and the minute her father died, she left home. So, she would never understand it. So, I said to him, \u201cSo Iam here, why I am here? You won\u2019t understand me either.\u201d It was an Italian guy. I said, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand me. What is it to be in the world alone? Two of us, nobody, no family, just two of us. Would you understand that?\u201d So he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that, she didn\u2019t tell that.\u201d\u2019 The trouble was, I walked in, he said... walked in. I was in wheelchair, because I fell on the steps here. 18 steps, and in the wheelchair I was forced to go to the psychiatrist. And he said to me, when I walked in, he says... Laura wasn\u2019t there, we went together and separate. And he says, \u201cHow many times your son called you when you were in New York?\u201d I says, \u201cThat\u2019s the complaint?\u201d I says, \u201cIf you are a good son...\u201d You. That\u2019s how I talked to him, \u201c\u2018and your father would die, and your mother is alone in the world, you wouldn\u2019t call her every night? And I paid the telephone bills.\u201d So, that she was complaining that he\u2019s calling me every night when the father died. And sometimes saying, and it was something, no, between us and Ilona, which I thank God, Iona... he always told me, \u201cYou can always count on Ilona.\u201d He loved Ilona. Jacob was very little. He loved Jacob, but Ilona was six... \u201882 and she was born \u201976, six years old. So Ilona was already a bigger girl. And she always said, \u201cYou always can count on Iona.\u201d And I must tell you, he was always teaching me if he dies, what 1s going to happen and how much I should divulge. I says, \u201cFrank, please don\u2019t talk about that.\u201d He says, \u201cI know I am going to die when I am 69.\u201d I says, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He says, \u201cBecause my uncle came home from hunting, he was fine, too.

And he had a heart attack,\u201d so every night\u2014I didn\u2019t sleep many nights with him\u2014 every night he got shaved, he got dressed, and he was sleeping in that chair. He was always prepared that he has to go to the hospital or something, after the heart attack. It was terrible. And he was always teaching me what to do and how to do it. \u201cAnd I leave you enough,\u201d he said, \u201cthat you can live like a princess if you want to, but if you want to live with your daughter-in- law...\u201d  End of Tape 4, Side B  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

            "question": "Okay, tape number five, side A of an interview with Emilie Szekely. And you told on the other tape about your... how you got out of Hungary. And then you went to Vienna? Can you talk about what you did in Vienna?",
            "answer": "You know how we got out from Hungary? That you know? Okay. In Vienna I worked for International Rescue Committee. Their office was in New York, and it was there a boarding school in the Vienna woods. A Hungarian teacher was in Vienna from New York, who came there, he had his mother and sister in Hungary, and he wanted to help them to come over. And his idea was to make a boarding school for the Hungarian refugee children. Those were all peasants\u2019 children. The parents got... is 1t on the tape once already? No. The peasants who came over and they got a contract in Santo Domingo, I don\u2019t know how many hundreds, that they get land there and they can work there and they get everything. Food and everything. And somehow, somehow, they couldn\u2019t get in touch with nobody, but somehow the International Rescue Committee find out that they didn\u2019t get nothing. They put them on the fields and they didn\u2019t give them nothing. So they managed to bring them back. So, they brought them back to Vienna and the parents, they put to the two camps. And the children, for the children, who were young, school kids, young, elementary school kids, and there were some bigger ones, they made that boarding school. It was a beautiful, beautiful place and it was like a palace in the woods. And he talked them into it, that he will be head of the school. And because they helped them anyway, the International Rescue Committee. This way they can go to school. So we had seven Hungarian teachers there. And the young ones had school there. And the older ones he took to the village, the first time I saw the... the Volkswagen bus. He had a Volkswagen bus. He took them by bus to German schools. And they were looking for a person for the office, one person does everything. And my... Ilona\u2019s sister-in-law, who was already in Vienna\u2014she\u2019s Ilona, too, both of them\u2014she spoke and was always corresponding, that\u2019s what she did, in German, French, English, Hungarian. And she worked for his very, very... her very, very, very, very rich cousin, who... he was so rich that he lived in an apartment in the middle of Vienna with his wife and two children near the opera house where Franz Josef, Franz Josef\u2019s girl friend lived. And unbelievable, unbelievable, the whole first floor with the same furniture. And he was ina business that time that started, I don\u2019t know what kind of electronics they started to make. And he was a big businessman. He was in Hungary, too, but in time he went to Vienna. And he worked in his office, she worked in his office. And she didn\u2019t get enough, she thought that she didn\u2019t get enough pay, then she went to American Embassy, asked for a job. Because she has those, wonderful, wonderful really, she was wonderful typist, too. And they recommended her to that job for International Rescue Committee. Because the International Rescue Committee was in connection with the... they were connected to the embassy, American Embassy. And she got that job. And when she said it to the cousin that she\u2019s leaving because she can get more money, the cousin said, \u201cI give you the same money.\u201d So then she wanted to stay, because she didn\u2019t have to travel. I had to travel by bus out of Vienna and then from the bus I had to walk in the woods. And in the winter it was terrible, big snow and I had to walk to work. But anyway. So, she said, \u201cLook, go there and tell him that you are my relative, and I have to give two weeks notice. I cannot leave right away, I have to give note and I can fill it in for her.\u201d So right away he says, \u201cOkay.\u201d He gives me a petty cash box with money. That was so funny because I wasn\u2019t used to that kind of a thing. And he told me what 1s the job, that I have to do the payroll. I have  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I have to, I don\u2019t know. I had to do the bookkeeping, but I never did. I took it home for my husband, because that was his job. I hated bookkeeping. And I never knew how to do it, but he graduated business school. He was a wonderful bookkeeper, so he did the bookkeeping. He didn\u2019t know. But when it came... he didn\u2019t know that I am taking it home. But when it came that I had to go with the German... not accountant, who was he? Gosh... he was an accountant, yes he was an accountant. And I had to give, where, what office, somewhere I had to go at the end of the year. Because it\u2019s the same thing, taxes. He says, \u201cWhat about?\u201d I couldn\u2019t answer and I told him, \u201cI am not doing it, my husband is doing it.\u201d [Laughing] I told him. He didn\u2019t care about it. But anyway two weeks later when it was two weeks, he says, \u201cWhere is Mrs. Schwartz?\u201d Her name... I says, \u201cShe decided to stay. If you want to keep me, okay. If not, thank you that you kept me.\u201d She says, \u201cYes, I want to keep you.\u201d That\u2019s how I got the job and they paid me in American money. I got the... oh, the Germans didn\u2019t want me. They didn\u2019t want to give me the... you had to have a certification that you can work there. I was no citizen. And they wanted the job. So in the kitchen it was a German woman, who was the everything, you know, she was overlooking and buying and everything. She was a German woman, but I was in the office. And then he got it. He got in touch with the Embassy and whatever and I got it. I still have it, the okay that I can work. And I got paid in American money. It was... I don\u2019t know, to me it seemed very much, because it was... I don\u2019t remember how much I got. But we didn\u2019t live in a camp, we didn\u2019t. We lived in an apartment, we lived together with Ilona and her husband. We had together an apartment. And George went to school and she took care of George. And she took back and forth him to school. And then in summer, George came with me there, when it was summer vacation. And they brought out there... they did everything for those kids. Unbelievable. And they brought a German artist there to teach them art in the summer. And George was, my George was in the group. And the first time he painted a head on a piece of wood. A piece of wood what was cut out from a tree. And he painted it, oil painting. And the guy came to me and he says, \u201cDo you know whom you have here?\u201d I says, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He said, \u201cHe\u2019ll be a great artist.\u201d Can you imagine that? And then in New York, too, in elementary... he came to middle school. He didn\u2019t lose nothing. He was in middle school, and there too the teacher came to the house. And he said, \u201cDo you know...\u201d the same words. I said, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He says, \u201cYou must come to the principal with me.\u201d I went to the principal, and they showed me his work, what is he doing. So, he wanted him to go to an art school in Manhattan, a high school. I don\u2019t know what was the name of it. And we misunderstood it. We thought it was music and art high school. And we took him to music and art high school. And it was, oh God, he was traveling on the subways, and that was, you know, it was so far away. Were you in New York? Yeah? It was near the City University, behind City University, behind Columbia University. And he was traveling for four years, because he had a portfolio and they took him. So he went already to music and art high school. And he was really good. And after that he went to Cooper Union, where they take only 50 kids from 500, he was amongst them. And Cooper Union 1s free, you know, that\u2019s a Foundation. And we just had to pay for the materials, but we didn\u2019t have to pay for his college. 50 took, about 50 from 500 applicants. He was amongst them. So we finished that. He never wanted to go out-of-town college. He was accepted to Penn State University, and I don\u2019t know where else he applied in case he cannot get to Cooper. But he never wanted to leave us. He said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t come to America to be separated.\u201d We were three of us, that\u2019s it. My uncle was still alive, but we were three of us.

And we stayed 17 months. After 17 months they give for 1,000 people, and we were amongst the first ones because the International Rescue Committee took us. I had my uncle and he sent an affidavit, but we didn\u2019t need it because they paid for us and they took us, the International Rescue Committee. And we were the very first ones. The interesting thing was that by that time, maybe half a year before, we had a Baroness, a real Baroness Reitzes (ph) was her name, working as a... over the housekeeping. She didn\u2019t do nothing actually. She lived in the middle of Vienna and she had a beautiful apartment, because we were there. She invited us. And she had a car, she came every, she wanted a job. Her husband was Jewish, and he was killed somewhere in labor camp. And she lived alone. She was a fat woman. And she had... her mother lived here, in New York. But she stayed in Vienna and she lived a big life. She had a big dog, I remember. And she had a housekeeper, but she wanted a job. She wanted a job. And she had a car and when she came, she picked me up every day by car and took me home by car, so it was much easier on me. But the interesting thing was that I never told her that I was in concentration camp. I never told her. I somehow, I don\u2019t know, they didn\u2019t see the number and... I don\u2019t know. I never say, never told even that I was Jewish, to her. He knew probably, he knew, of course he knew. Haber was his name. He was a school teacher in New York. That was his idea. And I don\u2019t know what happened to him, and to the school, too. Of course it\u2019s not there anymore. Habdersdorf (ph) was the name of the village. And she, when we got the okay to come, we had to go to Salzburg, to the Embassy. There was the American Embassy was in Salzburg, yes. And so she took us by car, three of us, to Salzburg. It was a beautiful, beautiful road. Unbelievable scenery. And then when we parted, I told her that Iam Jewish. [Laughing.|] She knew that I was in concentration camp. She didn\u2019t know up to that point and she was very upset that I didn\u2019t tell her before that I was in concentration camp. I never told anybody."

                " I never... I was very uncomfortable in Vienna. When we first, it was May when we got there and beautiful and we had... already it was arranged for us an apartment when we came. My uncle\u2019s brother arranged. And he was a Jewish man, who was saved in Singapore. He went with his son to Singapore. A very interesting man and he lived alone, an elderly man. And he had a pretty nice big apartment. And he had only one room for himself, and he gave two rooms and the kitchen to us. And so we were there and the windows were open. And when I got up in the morning and I heard the German language under the window, I got so crazy. I went crazy. My husband couldn\u2019t get a job. He didn\u2019t speak German. He couldn\u2019t get a job, but they gave him some kind of a... oh, no. When we left I got a letter from the International Rescue Committee that when we arrive we should go to New York, to their main office and show them the letter that I work for them. And we got a counselor there, and we went in and I give him the letter. I didn\u2019t say nowhere, it doesn\u2019t say nowhere that story? I gave him the letter, and he looks at me and says, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it that you don\u2019t remember me.\u201d I says, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, how do you know me?\u2019 She says, \u201cI was in the school there. They came some, observe the school from New York, the International Rescue Committee. Don\u2019t you remember I was there with my wife and I was in one car with you going back to Vienna?\u201d Then I remembered. I didn\u2019t even think about it, you know, that is somebody. So, he was very nice. He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to show me the letter, I know what you did there, but I must tell you, you did there everything. But in America you have to do one thing, and good, not so many things what you did there in the office. I\u2019m going to send you to NCR school.\u201d When I heard bookkeeping, I just didn\u2019t... you know? I didn\u2019t say no, but I didn\u2019t go, when he told me to go to. What happened, I didn\u2019t know that, I got pregnant. And I know it\u2019s that I got pregnant in Salzburg. I remember it, but I didn\u2019t know that I got pregnant. I didn\u2019t know. I had my period every month and I didn\u2019t know that I\u2019m pregnant. And three months later I started to bleed like terribly and I didn\u2019t know that I\u2019m pregnant. And I went to the doctor and he said you are pregnant, but you are going to have a miscarriage, because you have fibroids. So, I didn\u2019t go to International School. And he called me on the phone and he called me when I came back from the hospital. And I says, \u201cI was sick, and that\u2019s what happened. I had a miscarriage,\u201d I told him. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t go.\u201d But when I was better, they kept me, I was in the fourth month, and they kept me there five days. They thought every day the babies, four months. I was dying there. I lost so much blood. But then finally they did it. And they said that \u201cYou have to come back in six weeks and you have to have a hysterectomy.\u201d And six weeks later I went back and they said, \u201cNo you don\u2019t need it. It was so big, everything because you were pregnant. You don\u2019t need a hysterectomy.\u201d So then I went back. When he called me, I said, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t go now.\u201d So he sent me to NCR school. NCR was not the cashier machines, they were NCR machines, the cashier, you know. They had big, big bookkeeping machines, before the computers. Big bars, rechangeable that you could do everything. You could go, big papers with monthly statements and you could go checks. Other side I could put the vendor\u2019s card and put down to whom I am paying. And I went there and I learned it in one week. Oh, he asked whether I can type, I says, \u201cYes, I can type.\u201d So they taught me for the machine in one week and they gave me a job after one week. I didn\u2019t have any experience, but I knew how to do the machine. And they gave me a job in a publishing company in Manhattan, Columbus Square or Circle or what was it. And I had to travel from Brooklyn. I was so sick on the subways that I was more in the doctor\u2019s office than at home. It was terrible. I cannot, even in Hungary what is above the ground I was always standing outside on the air. I couldn\u2019t travel. And that was underground and was going on in New York subways. It was terrible.

And he tried to teach me, because I knew the machine, but I didn\u2019t have experience. I didn\u2019t have the speed, first of all, and if I made a mistake, I didn\u2019t know how to correct it. And he was very, very helpful. But the comptroller... not comptroller, liked me very much, the comptroller, but the bookkeeper, who was from Massachusetts, I didn\u2019t know from my life. I didn\u2019t know where is Massachusetts [laughing], and he was so proud of it, that he 1s from Massachusetts. He was amisery. And he was a Jew. And he made my life, he got back the checks from the bank, what I was typing. And he found mistakes. He was so miserable and he said to me, \u201cYou just came. You are a refugee, and you right away have to sit in an office?\u201d Can you imagine? A Jew. I was very miserable. It was 60 dollars a week, what was a nice pay at that time. And they gave me even commissions. I don\u2019t know what was it, from sale or something. I was there for three months and I was constantly looking for another job. And one day from New York Times, I see a job, Brooklyn Jewish Hospital is looking for an NCR operator. They were on strike because they were already... the half, not the office, but the kitchen and the... I don\u2019t know, cleaning people, they were in the Union. And they had a strike. The office, too, because nobody could, they had a black man working years on that machine, and he left because he got a better job under the strike. And they didn\u2019t have no one for three months. They had young girls, but they left. Young people don\u2019t want to sit and work. You had to sit at the machine. So, when I saw that, it was in walking distance from us, the hospital, and I had to pass by, every morning, my uncle\u2019s pharmacy. So he came always earlier to open that he should see me in the morning when I go to work or when I go home, because it was in a walking distance. And I never thought that I stay there. And the comptroller wasn\u2019t... was out of town or I don\u2019t know where. He wasn\u2019t there when I got the job. So the personnel, she gave me the job. And I was working, it was a big office and we had two machines like there, accounts payable and receivable. The receivable was another woman working. And the comptroller came back and he called me to the office and he greeted me and he was very, very nice to me. And he said, \u201cI must tell you one thing, if you do the job by Christmas...\u201d they were behind three months with bills. Well I saw those bins with bills. \u201cIf you do it by Christmas, the job is yours.\u201d So I started to do it and I started to be very fast on the machine, very fast. And I did it day before Christmas. So, but women there, they were Jewish women, they were very jealous. One of them, first of all I never spoke about concentration camp. Never. It was mixed, they were non-Jews and Jews there, and I never spoke to them about it. And one woman, a Jewish woman, she said to me, \u201cWhy did you come to America?\u201d This way. I says, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He says, \u201cWhy, the communism is not enough good?\u201d I says, \u201cMaybe it is good for you because you have a house, every child of you has a car and you have a nice job. You could change place with me,\u201d I said. [Laughing] Can you imagine that? She was a Leftist. And she didn\u2019t work on a machine, but she worked in the office. That time it was everything together, the billing. We had a big, big office and machine and no machine. The machines were in the back. And then there was another woman, who was like that man there, who was controlling me and she was miserable, too. If I made a mistake, she was miserable. And I was crying, and I went to the Comptroller and I says, \u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d She says, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d And I told him what\u2019s happening. He says, \u201cYou come to me, you don\u2019t go to them. If you don\u2019t know something you come to me.\u201d It was aman. And from then on, I was all right. I had trouble because I had to answer the telephone. I was payable and the vendors were calling me. So, in the beginning I had big trouble. I spoke English, but I spoke English, not Yankee. Because I learned English from an  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We had private lessons. And my sister was very, very smart. And we were reading Anna Karenina in English and... I told you, no? That story. So we learned English. And we didn\u2019t understand each other on the phone, you know? [Laughing.] So in the beginning I had problems, but then it was okay. Even the Americans came to me, how do you spell that, how do you spell this? You know? That was the end. But I never thought that I stay there 27 years. I stayed there 27 years. I went through many comptrollers. [Laughing.| He left, but he was a long time there. But he left. And then one day the Personnel Director comes in, closes the door and he says, \u201cAttention, please.\u201d Everybody looks up, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d He says, \u201cI must announce it, that from yesterday on, everybody is in the Union.\u201d So I didn\u2019t know what does it mean and why is it good or bad, just in the Union. Fine. I don\u2019t care where we are. And it was an unbelievable advantage. I was the highest paid because of the machines. So, if somebody got three dollars pay and raise, I got five dollars raise. From 60 dollars in one year, because I started with 60 back there in the other place, I went up to 125 dollars because of the Union. And thank God, because of the Union, I have a pension today from the Union, and I have free medication. My medication bills are 4,000 dollars a year, because they are sending me the company\u2019s and that\u2019s another pension, 4,000 dollars. And I am getting pension. And because... oh, that\u2019s the story. Before I... a year before I left, it was another strike. And I didn\u2019t go to work, because I was afraid. You know? Crossing the picket lines. But I never picketed, never. I was in the country for a month, it was a month strike. And I was in touch with them. I called always Personnel. Personnel was begging me, \u201cPlease come back.\u201d Because by that time we had only one machine, it was no more receivable because they gave it out to computers. So, I was the only machine and the only person who knew the machine. They were typing checks, the people who were non-Union. And it was horrible, horrible, they were behind, and terrible. And he was begging me, \u201cPlease come back. Come back, don\u2019t worry, nobody is picketing anymore.\u201d And they were in the country and one day he calls me and he says, \u201cCome back. We are going to send you a Black girl down for you if you are afraid. We are watching you when you when you are coming. And please come back.\u201d And they went to the country and they dropped me off and they are watching it whether I go in. It was no picketing. It was no picket line anymore. And I went in and then everybody was shocked, because nobody knew that I am not in the Union. I couldn\u2019t have, I couldn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know. It was... they just didn\u2019t believe it that I am, you know, in the Union, in the Union, the people. Because that was a job what was a confidential job, with the payroll and everything. So they didn\u2019t believe it that I am in the Union. So, what happened, the person... End of Tape 5, Side A This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

                " ... you get out from the Union. They didn\u2019t know that I am close to retirement. That I wanted to retire. I didn\u2019t know either. If you get out from a union and you get the hospital pension and you get medication from the hospital, doctors from the hospital and they give you 25,000 a year. I said, \u201cHow do I do that?\u201d He says, \u201cI\u2019m going to send a telegram,\u201d because the Union was threatening us, that if we are still on strike they are not going to cover us medically. Because they had very good medical coverage. Every doctor wanted you if you were in the Union. I says, \u201cI cannot live without medical coverage.\u201d She says, \u201cOkay so I\u2019m going to tell them that you cannot be without coverage and you are out from the Union.\u201d So, for one year, I went out from the Union. Then after a year, I wanted to retire. I worked one year more than 65, 66 I was when I left. And I says, \u201cCan you put me back to the Union?\u201d Because they would have to give me a pension from the hospital if I am not in the Union. So the personnel, the secretary, his secretary, arranged it that they paid me for one year dues, for one year everything, because they paid for medical for us, the Union. And they paid for pension. I paid the bills, hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Union. I was paying them. And they said that it was a mistake and they got me back to the Union. Can you imagine? It was such a luck because I wouldn\u2019t have the Union. I wouldn\u2019t have the pension because they say to me... I\u2019m talking to some people from the hospital, \u201cIt\u2019s terrible, it\u2019s almost bankrupt.\u201d We were bankrupt after ten years, we went to Chapter 11. I went to, through with them, voided thousands and thousands of checks and everything after ten years. And they had to merge with another hospital. It was St. Joseph... St. John\u2019s. Here is St. Joseph\u2019s. St. John\u2019s Hospital. And then we got more, we were the main hospital. We got more employees. It was 3,000 people. And we paid everything. We paid they bills, too, for medication, for the pharmacy tech, everything. It was everything through us. So it was a very big job. But I had a separate room because the machine was very noisy. And I was alone in the room, so that was very good. And they always wanted me to be a manager and I didn\u2019t want to because I knew that I am out of the Union if I am a manager. I says, \u201cI do the job. I am not a manager.\u201d So, I was lucky.  "

They didn\u2019t let me go through because they said that I have something on my lungs. It turned out that I had pneumonia in the camp and I didn\u2019t know about it and it showed.

I don\u2019t know how many hundreds of people, and so uncomfortable, and we were sitting in the last row, near the toilet. And they were only two seats, so we always changed. One sits with George and then the other one was sitting alone, you know? But we were sitting in the same row, but between us the aisle. Very uncomfortable, very. I think we were 24 hours in the air.

And from that I got so sick, that the whole journey to New York, it was just unbelievable. I was so sick. But I was pregnant and I didn\u2019t know, maybe that\u2019s why I was sick from the food. So when we arrived, it was that time Kennedy Airport... no, La Guardia, \u2019m sorry. La Guardia, not Kennedy Airport. And we saw my uncle and my aunt up there waiting for us and waving. And we saw the first Black man in our lives. They had a postman, who delivered the mail and he had a car. And my uncle, he came always... he had like here in pharmacies they have a counter where you have food, too. It was so strange to me, because there is no such a thing in Europe in pharmacies. Pharmacy is pharmacy. And he was telling him that if he has a free day, that he is going to pay him take him to the airport and wait for us. So he was a fat man and it was the first time in my life that I saw a black man. And he was taking us home to my uncle. They lived not very far from the pharmacy. Though the house was theirs, the pharmacy was one day apartments. They lived in a separate apartment. And he had a partner because his diploma... I have still his Russian diploma, was not certificated, so he had an American partner. Very nice people. They lived in the house, in the upstairs in the house. They were very good friends. They didn\u2019t have children, and they didn\u2019t have children. They were very good friends. He was a very nice man. And so we were three days in our uncle\u2019s house. It was only, what they had, the living room is a big, big. Bedroom they had, and a living room, a kitchen. It was a private, private house. I don\u2019t know, bathroom, nothing else. They had two in the house, two apartments in the house, the landlord and them. And they rented for us, in that kind of a house, but in another street, an apartment, upstairs. But it was small. It was just a bedroom and a little living room and at the end of the living room was the kitchen, a small kitchen with a small frigidaire. So, that was our first apartment. And that was our street where George went to middle school."

They had five o\u2019clock teas. And of course, the end was always the Holocaust, talking about the Holocaust, because almost all of them were in Holocaust, you know, there. So, I felt very well. I felt... yeah. The last six months when I left, when I was alone there, my husband died, I was there four more years alone and then they... ... \u201cGeorge, when are you coming?\u201d I met a woman, who was my age exactly and he worked... I told you that too? He worked, she worked in Manhattan in the jewelry section. She was an American. And she didn\u2019t live very far from us. And I went every week, I went to the theater. I said it? I told that story? But we had private buses and they went certain hours, because I didn\u2019t want to go by train. And I didn\u2019t drive to Manhattan. She was going to the same beauty parlor as me and she was sitting near me. And one day I hear that she\u2019s talking about it that she was in Alaska and whatever, but still I didn\u2019t talk to her. Maybe I am not friendly. I am not talking to people whom I don\u2019t know, but I overheard everything. But she noticed... yeah, I go to the bus and I am waiting on the bus. And she lived in that street where the bus stop was and she went to Manhattan, too. And she said to me, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d It\u2019s first time she spoke to me. I said, \u201cI am going to the theater.\u201d She says, \u201cAlone?\u201d I says, \u201cYes, my husband died and I\u2019m going alone.\u201d She said, \u201cMy God, would you get me a ticket, too? For next performance?\u201d I says, \u201cWhy not?\u201d She said, \u201cBecause I am alone, too. My husband died.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhere do I leave the ticket?\u201d She said, leave it with my beautician when you go the beauty parlor. And I left the ticket, and from then on we became good friends. And every week we went together, but not by bus. I was driving. I know how to drive, but she didn\u2019t have a car. She knew where to go, but I knew how. And we went by car. And there was the parking under the theater and it paid. Because it was $3.50 a trip, you know, it\u2019s seven dollars, fourteen from ten dollars, parking under the theater. And after that we went always to Marriott Hotel, up, they had a wonderful, wonderful, like Viennese Bakery, a garden restaurant, where they had coffee and cake.

When I went to the city I was wearing always high heels. Because in the office I was wearing always high heels. And that was the custom. We couldn\u2019t understand.

We didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t have blacks. We didn\u2019t. Oh, I\u2019m sorry. I saw the first black man in the English Army. I saw a soldier. And it wasn\u2019t even... I don\u2019t know whether he was in the English army. It\u2019s interesting, they were taking us by jeep to Nuremberg from Bergen-Belsen. And another jeep came and they were throwing to us from their jeep, oranges. And it was a black soldier. That was the first one. Not the first one. Yes, that was the first one.

My daughter was just taught in Tates Creek High that she shouldn\u2019t believe it. That they shouldn\u2019t believe it, it was a Holocaust. It was made up by the Jews.\u201d I thought I faint. I says, \u201cWhat?\u201d She says, \u201cYes, she was just taught. And I very surprised to see you. I never saw a survivor.\u201d Then a woman came here\u2014I came here the first time alone when we didn\u2019t move in yet and they had blinds made in the family room\u2014and she was from McAlpins. And I\u2019m sitting in the chair and she sits near me, this way, and she noticed the number. And she jumps up and she starts to scream. I says, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d She says, \u201cI never saw somebody, I never saw nobody, who came back from there. Let me have a, let me, can I make a prayer for you?\u201d And she kneels down and she starts to pray like I would come, you know, from somewhere, an alien. It was unbelievable experience. But after that when it happened, that she said they were teaching it. She was teaching in Nicholasville, Laura, at that time. And I told her, I says, \u201cWhere did you bring me? That\u2019s what they teach here? I never heard it in my life.\u201d And she was very upset, and she spoke to the high school teacher there and she said, \u201cHow about if she would come to school?\u201d I says, \u201cI cannot talk. I never spoke in my life.\u201d She says, \u201cHow about if I come to your house?\u201d She said. So she came, and I spoke to the microphone for two hours. And from that moment on, she [phone rings] ...She came from the high school. I spoke two hours in the microphone. And it was no stop.

It was a regular high school, but I spoke at the high school there, when there were women who were pregnant and they were going to school. That was another high school, but that was regular high school. I don\u2019t know what was the name, in Nicholasville, Jessamine County. And they were, it was a man teacher, who was very, very nice. He was a history teacher. But it was a... they sat like around the wall in circle they put the chairs. And on that side, on the left side, 1t was a circle with about ten boys, who were shaved, their heads and they didn\u2019t look at me. Because at that time I was beginner speaker and I started to speak and I asked them who believes in the Holocaust, that the Holocaust is true, they should put their hands up. They didn\u2019t. And the whole time I was talking and they didn\u2019t look at me. So when I finished, and I was pretty nervous, that was my first speech. But it was good because the teacher was absolutely wonderful. And he was embracing me and \u201cThank God for you, that you are here,\u201d and that kind of a thing. And I says, \u201cAnd do you know whom you have here?\u201d He says, \u201cUnfortunately, yes.\u201d So, that was a bad experience for me, you know, that there are skinheads there. It was in Nicholasville. But then I spoke many, many times in Nicholasville middle school, and when Laura was teaching, that was middle school. And that high school. I don\u2019t know what was the name of that high school. They were all girls, women, I mean, and one of them came to me.  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Then it was non-stop, one school after the other. Then it was in Paris, Kentucky. In Paris, Kentucky it was a professor in education. That was George\u2019s department, education, I mean he was in Art and Education, two appointments. A very nice, very nice professor. And he had student teachers in Paris, Kentucky, and he took me to Paris, Kentucky. And some, they took videos there that day, but it was a very big wind and the windows were open. They didn\u2019t have air conditioners. And the videos didn\u2019t came out. Well, so he took me the second time and he took with him a professional videotaper from U.K. And I didn\u2019t know nothing, who else is there, but I saw that they are women there and they are taking pictures, too, from me. And they are writing. I had no idea that the paper is there. He called The Herald. And that was the first time when I was in The Herald-Leader. And when I was in The Herald Leader, it was no stop. People were calling me. Schools were calling me, and I can tell you that I spoke in every school in Lexington, not once, because I spoke 160 times already. Because usually I, they put together six, seven, eight grades usually in the auditort1um. And if the next bunch of kids comes, they call me back again. And in every high school I spoke, too. In every high school. I spoke twice in Dunbar. In... what is that station? Bryan Station, Bryan Station, they were very nice there. I spoke in Lafayette. Now I have to go again. Because I spoke when Ilona was there and still the teacher is there and now Anna has the teacher. And she, he was asking whether your grandmother still does it. And Henry Clay, I spoke at Henry Clay. Twice I spoke already at the Community College. Three times at U.K. I spoke in the nurse\u2019s department, Psychiatric Nurses\u2019 department.

I cannot go steps up again, and up and down. And they made a half bathroom there, I made. I had to pay half for it, the time that I am up there. And that\u2019s only half bathroom. If I want to take a bath, I have to go downstairs. It\u2019s no more comfortable for me. It came to a point that it\u2019s no more comfortable."

            "answer": "No, no. The people are so far away from it. Even then, when it happened, I think, they were so far away from it, that it\u2019s only me that I am afraid that 1t can happen and what can happen. It\u2019s only me who went through. They are laughing when I am saying it, that I am afraid from everything. I am afraid of my shadow, you know, that kind of a situation. But no. When we went to Hungary and they were asking us, \u201cHow could you live there? This is a jungle there, in New York.\u201d You know? They have a very bad opinion of what\u2019s happening in New York. It\u2019s happening here, too. This is much smaller and what\u2019s happening here, when you open the television, they start the killing. Okay, it\u2019s a family killing or whatever but it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s happening here, too. And it\u2019s always worse for the people who don\u2019t live in a place. You know, it seems much worse. I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t afraid in New York where I lived. Once I was very afraid, when I sold my house and I sold it to a Chinese guy, who, they knew that they have to give back Hong Kong, and they were coming. And he said that he wants it for his family. Baloney. He made a business from it. He made from a two-family house, four families. For money, he\u2019s getting rent. Unbelievable. From the basement he made two apartments and two apartments what we had upstairs. I went to see it when... there\u2019s no garage. From the garage he made an apartment. It\u2019s unbelievable. And he wanted to get out from it, the last minute. But he had 25 thousand dollar, 25 put down? How much? I don\u2019t know how many thousands he had to put down when we made the agreement. It was in the lawyers, collateral, you know. And he wanted to, if he doesn\u2019t get the mortgage what he wants, that he can get out from it, but he got the mortgage what he wanted. The lawyer find out he got the mortgage what he wanted. But he wanted a cheaper mortgage and he wanted to get out. But then he would lose that money. I think it was 25. I don\u2019t remember. Anyway. And I was getting phone calls and it was a strange, strange accent, that I am going to come and kill you. So then I said, \u201cMy God, I want to get out as early as can from here.\u201d You know? I think they were those people, those Chinese, I don\u2019t know. Then I was very afraid. Though in the beginning I was very afraid, we were robbed. So I slept, not in our house, we lived in an apartment and we were one apartment, second apartment, we were robbed. But that\u2019s why we bought the house, we went out from that neighborhood. But otherwise, otherwise I didn\u2019t have that fear. I didn\u2019t go on the subways, I was driving. And it was very dangerous already, in the hospital, too. So it was a parking lot across the street where I paid parking. And I just ran to the building. It was very dangerous. I got out at the last minute really, because if you walked in the hospital itself, in the lobby, and you had a necklace on or something, people from outside came and they took it off. So it was a very dangerous place. And it is very interesting that every hospital in New York, it is in a bad place now. It is very interesting. Even Flowers (ph), Fifth Avenue, my God, my husband was operated, spine operation and I went to visit him with George. Behind it there were big buildings and we had to get off the subway. And they were throwing bottles against us. That was the best hospital, the name Flower, Fifth Avenue. Can you imagine? That was years ago. Stay in Harlem, or no. So, we came here. What I was seeing today on the television show, it\u2019s really scary, about five black guys, who are thieves. And that show is from New York, and how they are stealing cars and how they are just bumping into people\u2019s cars. And then innocent women, they get out, what happened. And they get out too, behind them and they grab their necks, put them in the other car behind them and they take that car because it\u2019s a better car than theirs. There were five of them. Can you imagine that? I don\u2019t know how they can say it on the television this way. And there was a detective there, too. And they were saying it, how they are show it how they are doing it and they are selling it. And she said, \u201cHow much you get for that car?\u201d She says, \u201cWe sell it for  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And if it\u2019s a Mercedes, a nice, new one, sometimes 5,000 dollars.\u201d This is, this is, now again a more dangerous life since I came. They were stealing cars, of course they were stealing cars, but that way I didn\u2019t hear it, never, when I was living there. So it\u2019s now 13 years."

And she, nobody was her friend, only I. [Laughing.] But she lives here a long, long time, and her mother was Russian. And she was born in Canada. And she\u2019s telling me that this neighborhood, when she... they builded the house. They didn\u2019t allow Jews in this neighborhood. That was what she was telling me. And then I had a remark. Somebody came, I don\u2019t know who was it, those guys who are, you know, trying to convert you. I don\u2019t know which religion was it. And I said, \u201cI am not interested. I am Jewish.\u201d And he said, \u201cWhat is it, everybody is Jewish in this neighborhood?\u201d I says, \u201cNo, minority.\u201d They are all Baptist here, in this neighborhood. But now there are a few Jewish families. But she said that they weren\u2019t allowed here in this neighborhood, Jews. I didn\u2019t, as I said, I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know about it. And she, she was unbelievable, they didn\u2019t want to take her nowhere between them, because she was marrying to a Chinese. He is a genius. He is now 70, I don\u2019t know, something. He got tenure. He was with IBM originally. And then he was teaching at UK. And now he is teaching in Frankfort in state university. And at age 70 they gave him tenure. He is such a genius. But he is Chinese. And she has two Chinese, he has two daughters, a daughter and a son, both of them are doctors. And they were really suffering in this neighborhood, she said, because they were Chinese kids. She was always telling me what they went through. So, it\u2019s any difference, Chinese or Jew? If they don\u2019t, if it\u2019s not their own, then they don\u2019t like you. I don\u2019t know. We are friends. With this building now.

And we didn\u2019t go to each other\u2019s houses, but when we spoke we were very nice. And her daughter, Jenna\u2019s daughter, when she got married in Louisville all the neighbors got together, five of us and we went all to the wedding, to her daughter\u2019s wedding, because she didn\u2019t have any family here. She doesn\u2019t have any family here. And because I am Jewish and she is married to a Chinese [laughing] so we are very good friends. We are going together, she helps me enormously. She is a very good person. Now she was, she was nurse, actually. She went for nursing in Case Western, in Cleveland. She met him there somewhere, I don\u2019t know, in Ohio. She... really, she felt it at UK. She was in the Nursing department and she was the head of the private nurses at that time they had. And she had to give the patients the nurses. And she is absolutely, you know, she didn\u2019t know about discrimination. And she gave once a black nurse to a white person. She was fired. And then when she was fired from there she started to tutor. She is very good in math. And she tutored all the kids from this neighborhood. She knows everybody because she was a tutor. And from that, because it was not enough what her husband made, they send the two children to medical school.

It\u2019s only a few words about the Second World War, the Holocaust. And I don\u2019t know whether it ever will be. And they are very grateful and gracious. And really they do everything for me.
