            "question": "Galina\u2013?",
            "answer": "Galina Bashikis (ph). Bashikis. My son, by coincidence got him a job with the Gray Construction Company, because she had a student, he had a student in one of the schools, who was his student and then she became a teacher. And he went back with his children there. He goes always, one semester he takes his class to schools and they are\u2013 Adopt a School, that\u2122s the name of it. And they are teaching there, but they are just students, not graduate students and he\u2122s observing them before they make their lesson plans and they have to show it to him. And he\u2122s running from class to class. And one day, she came to that school and she said, \ufb01Does anybody know somebody who has connections to a construc tion company?\ufb02 And that teacher, he says, \ufb01My fianc\u00e9,\ufb02 one of the Grays\u2122 son. He says, \ufb01My fianc\u00e9.\ufb02 So, from that time on they hired him, and he\u2122s a person who, he didn\u2122t mind what ki nd of job they gave him. He did very hard job. And he loves the construction. He loves to see. He was in, I don\u2122t know how many buildings he builded. He was already a big shot there. When they got their visa to come to America. And he work day and night for an apartment in Moscow. In the middle of Moscow the apartment was ready and they would be separated from the mother-in-law. And they would have a beautiful apartment there. And the visa wa s starting to expire, so my cousin said, \ufb01It is not worth, what is thousands of thousands dollars that apartment. It doesn\u2122t worth, you have to go.\ufb02 He was in Odessa, but he helped them. He came to Moscow and helped them to pack and they came. And she was very happy. And when sh e got to the apartment she couldn\u2122t believe it. You know, they lived in two sma ll rooms there, so many people, four. I mean two children and the couple and the grandmother. And she was very happy. One day\u2013 she sent, before she came, she sent a hundred and twenty packages to my name, because she didn\u2122t know where to send it and they were all Russian books. And I said, \ufb01That woman is crazy. She needs American books. Why is she sending the Russian books?\ufb02 But all, you know, Dostoevsky, whatever. The children, the big one\u2013 the little one didn\u2122t go to school yet, but the big one went to school, to the same school where my husband got the job from the teacher. It was in their neighborhood. And she spoke beautiful English already and she had\u2013 when the grandmother came the following year in January, his mother came. She didn\u2122t come, the other one. And she was 4 helping her and she was translating and answering the telephone. And then I started to see it. I started to invite them for holidays, and she came. She sat at the table five minutes and after five minutes she excused herself and went to the porch to play with the children. I didn\u2122t think about nothing, about it. I says, \ufb01It\u2122s a little strange, but okay if she wants it.\ufb02 When it come the second year, she said, \ufb01I love you, but please don\u2122t invite us for the holidays.\ufb02 Still I didn\u2122t think it was something wrong there. Then she met a couple, I still don\u2122t know who they are, a Christian couple, who went every week to Cincinnati. And she got very friendly with them. And she went with the two children and the re ason was, because she went for his American degree, what he got, no problem. He got his American degree, but when the children are home, he cannot study. And we go there. It\u2122s more things to do there. We take them to the zoo and blah, blah, blah. One day they come home, it was probably a year later and the father is asking them, \ufb01How was the zoo?\ufb02 And the big one said, \ufb01What kind of z oo?\ufb02 He says, \ufb01You didn\u2122t go to the zoo?\ufb02 She says. \ufb01No, we went to the church.\ufb02 So he got very upset that she does it behind his back. Very, very upset. And I don\u2122t know whether they knew it\u2013 he was married eleven years, but they knew each other five years already from the scho ol. And I don\u2122t know the situation, because the grandmother was there with them. But he was traveling a lot. The company was sending him constantly, because they mostly work outside fr om Lexington. They build big, big factories, not housing. And he was always sent out. One, two years after they were here, she says, \ufb01I want to go home for the summer, to visit my mother.\ufb02 I sa ys, \ufb01Isn\u2122t it easier to bring your mother here?\ufb02 She says, \ufb01No, my mother wouldn\u2122 t like it here.\ufb02 She packed. And she liked me. She was working in the St. Joseph Hospital, though she was an engineer and she went for courses to\u2013 computer courses to the community college. Bu t that job, cleaning job, she took at night, that she should be with the children during the day. What was the job? She was calling me on the phone constantly for hours. She says, \ufb01I am cleaning the clean stuff, the offices\u2013\ufb02 and she says, \ufb01It\u2122s\u2013 in an hour I am ready.\ufb02 Perfect. Salary was perfect, everything was perfect. Two years, right two years after in the summer, it was A ugust. And sometimes I was taking her, I was driving her to work. They didn\u2122t live close here, but I picked her up. They lived in, it\u2122s Heritage Village, near Henry Clay High School. That\u2122s wh ere all the Russians lived at that time. I\u2122m sorry. I picked her up and I took her to work. And she says, \ufb01I want to tell you something, because I love you. But you must swear that you won\u2122t tell it to Mischa.\ufb02 Mischa, Michael is her husband. I thought, \ufb01My God what it could be that I cannot tell it to him?\ufb02 So, I says, \ufb01Okay, I swear.\ufb02 And I am driving. I almost made an accident what I heard. She says, \ufb01I\u2122m not coming back. I took a ticket, r ound trip, but I\u2122m not coming back. I don\u2122t want my children to be brought up here. I want them to be brought up as Russians,\ufb02 and it meant\u2013 because she never mentioned Jew. She mentioned Americans and Russians. I says, \ufb01You are talking about Americans as Jews and Russians,\ufb02 right away I knew, \ufb01\u2013as the Russian Orthodox Church?\ufb02 She says, \ufb01No, no. I don\u2122t mean that.\ufb02 I says, \ufb01Yes you mean it. You mean it.\ufb02 The husband was\u2013 I don\u2122t know where. And he came home, a nd it was the little one\u2122s birthday. And she made a birthday party and I was there. And th ey\u2122re supposed to leave the following day to New York. And the father, who lived in Boston, wa s visiting\u2013 we have a summer home in the country, in the Catskills and he was with my son there. And he\u2122s supposed to go to the airport, help her to go to the airport in New York. So, I said to myself, I just c ouldn\u2122t believe it. I says, \ufb01Why are you doing it? How can you look in your husband\u2122s eye and pack?\ufb02 I don\u2122t know, everything she took, what she could. Six packages, because they took two, two, two, everyone of them and they were little kids. She says, \ufb01If he would be better to me\u2013\ufb02 I says, \ufb01Better? He lives for you. He\u2122s such a father and working like unbelievable that you should have everything. 5 And you say better?\ufb02 Better was that he didn\u2122t let them go to church. That was the worst. And she told it in the hospital that if I don\u2122t come back, because my husband is bad to me. So, what shall I do? I swore. I cannot te ll it to Mischa. I called my cous in in the country. I says, \ufb01Look, I swore that I don\u2122t tell it to Mischa, but I didn\u2122t swear that I\u2122m not telling it to you. Your daughter won\u2122t come back. Please don\u2122t help he r to go on that plane. At least the children should be saved and taken away, because she kidnapped them.\ufb02 She said, \ufb01That\u2122s\u2013 it\u2122s impossible. It\u2122s impossible.\ufb02 And when she di dn\u2122t come back after a month, she went for a month, and I said, I told it to Mischa. She says, \ufb01I don\u2122t believe you. She\u2122s the most honest woman in the world. If you would tell it to me right at that time, I wouldn\u2122t believe you, that she is doing it to me.\ufb02 And she did it. She kidnapped the two kids."

And so, I knew everything about him. And I knew th at he was a big artist there, but he worked for the state, Communism. They al ways had work, but they had to do what they told them to do. So, he was a real artist and then he had a little studio separate from the house. And he painted what he wanted, because his dream\u2013 he loves Odessa and he wanted to paint Odessa as he knew it once. And he did it. They didn\u2122t know about it, because he did the commercials for everything, for the ships and for operas and everything. His name was everywhere because he did the commercials. So, I knew about him. Now, when my uncle died in 1973, I took over the writing because it was no one else. And I started to write Russian, but it was very hard for me, because I never spoke Russian.

And one day, when my father was called in and he was captured in Prague and they took him behind the frontier to a pharmacy and there he meets his brother. And he met his brot her and they never separated. They didn\u2122t want to go back after the war because there were the bi ggest pogroms in Kiev and they didn\u2122t want to go back there. And it was an international agreement that they can stay in the countries where they were captured. Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia was one, Austro-Hungarian empire. So, after a while when they were there, they took them to Hungary to a chemical factory, both of them, together. I have, I think there\u2122s a picture there, too, about them in Russia uniforms. They took them to Hungary and under the war my mother was working there in the office, in that place. And that\u2122s how they met and fell in love. And my mother\u2122s family was very, very upset.

And they put \u0152 oh I have a picture here. It\u2122s very interesting. They made a concentration camp. They builded near Russia\u2013 near Budapest and they put all the Russians there. My mother was married in 1919, the beginning of 1919. And they put them th ere. They didn\u2122t know what\u2122s going to happen to them. My uncle was there. He wasn \u2122t married. My mother had a cousin, who was a lawyer and he came there one day. It was already May, middle of 1919, because she was pregnant with me. By the way, she got pregnant. She was pregnant with me. And she said, he said, \ufb01You can go out from here only one way, if you sign that you never come back to Hungary.\ufb02 So, my mother, who was Hungarian, sh e had to sign that she never comes back to Hungary. It was easy to sign it for my father a nd my uncle, but they had to sign it. So, where should they go? In 1920, Czechoslovakia it was, the Czech map is Czech, Moravia, Slovakia, Carpathan. The Carpathan part, what was Hungary, after the war, the Czechs got it. My mother had a second cousin there and when she heard about it, what happened, she says, \ufb01Come to us.\ufb02 They were well-to-do people. \ufb01Come to us.\ufb02 So, they went there to Czechoslovakia. It was at that time Czechoslovakia in 1920. When it came to me, to give birth, my mother got permission through that lawyer to go home and I was born in my grandmother\u2122s house, but they didn\u2122t have an apartment. They did have\u2013 they lived with th ose relatives, so they left me there with my grandmother and my mother\u2122s sisters. She had th ree sisters. One of them was married, two were not married and a brother, who was never married. He was a bachelor. Because my grandmother was a widow when she was 34 years old, and she had five children. The son took over and he was working for the family. And th at\u2122s why he never got married, until the sisters got married and whatever. He was already 50 year s old and he didn\u2122t get married. So we lived there and 22 months after I was born, my mother was again \u0152 she was pregnant. She gave birth to my sister. The same thing happened. She went home with special papers and she was born there in my grandmother\u2122s house. By that time they had already an apartment and they took me together with my little sister back to Czechoslovakia. So."

And the big one, Ilona. That\u2122s a real Hungarian name. She\u2122s named after my mother\u2122s youngest sister, who saved my life. That\u2122s in there, I think. So, Ilona is named af ter her.

He was an unbelievable, very, very beautiful boy and he left a very wealthy girl because of me. He love d me very much, but I was so na\u00efve that I didn\u2122t think that I love him.

It\u2122s terrible. One lived in Prague, she got married and then they came to America and her husband was a dermatologi st and then he got Alzheimer\u2122s disease. Anyway. So, she, we became, we are still friends, but now telephone friends. We are talking. And she has two very successful children, unbelievable. He\u2122s a dentist. Middle of New York, he has an office.

She has a brother and she has a sister-in-law in Montreal, because her brother died when they came to Canada. When we came here, they went to Canada. And he was a paper (ph) engineer. He wasn\u2122t used to Canadian winter, slippery. And he made a car accident and he got a stroke from it. And he didn\u2122t die, but he got a second stroke and he died. And he was a young man. He was 42, something like that and he left his wife and his young eight years old son in Canada. And the wife had a German nana. She was a real German, wonderful, wonderful person, from her childhood. Because she had very, very wealthy pare nts, and she had a sister, she died, too. And her parents died, but that woman, she stayed with her all through her life. And she was bringing up her son, too. And then she died in Canada. She never went back. She was from Vienna. Very nice person. I remember her so well. I met her many times when we went to Canada. First they lived in Montreal and they moved to Toront o when the French started that you had to speak French. He\u2122s an engineer, too, my cousin."

And, but they were good friends. And then we had Hungarian friends, Jewish girls friends. We had. We had quite a lot. And we got together, before I went out with the boy. We got together always, every week at somebody\u2122s house. During the week it was strictly studying. And we went to movies and as I said\u2013 then we belonged to a Jewish organization, Kadima (ph) , that\u2122s actually, they have it in Israel now, too, Kadima."

            "answer": "It is a Zionist organization, yes, and it was a youth organization. And in the summer we made excursions, but only for one day, in the mountai ns together. It was a very nice life in Czechoslovakia. The Czech people are wonderful people and that was the real democracy. What I lived under, Masaryk and Benes (ph) , that was a real democracy. And I am laughing when I am talking here about democracy. I sa ys, \ufb01Do those people know what\u2122s democracy?\ufb02 You know, there are castes here and everywhere. And even in the hospital\u2013 I worked 27 years in Brooklyn Jewish Hospital. And there were very few people who were really, as you say, mensch people. Like it was a old doctor, he was the head of the Pediatrics. He was the only one who went there in the morning and he shook hands with the elevator guy and something like that. You know? It was\u2013 it was entirel y different. They speak here about democracy, but they don\u2122t know what it is. I remember that once before, my husband\u2013 my father had many jobs before they had, they bought a\u2013 I don\u2122t know what year was it. They bought together a drugstore. But drugstore, it means, because they didn\u2122t have th eir diploma or certificate. And I have my own diploma, Russian diploma. So when he came to America, he worked in New York in a pharmacy, in a German pharmacy, and he was the head of the Herbs department. They sell many, many. But he couldn\u2122t do a prescription. And that was the situation with my father, too, when they went to Czechoslovakia. So they bought a drugstore, but they had everything but prescription drugs. But they didn\u2122t have luncheonettes like here. It was no such a thing. But the trouble was, then they separated and a pharmacist died. And it was a beautiful new pharmacy. And his wife wanted my father to work for he r. Okay. He took over and he was substituting outside. He knew pharmacists and when they were for vacation, he was substituting in the pharmacy. He knows, he did everything. And th en when he took over that pharmacy and my uncle had the drugstore. And it was a big pl ace and a small place, because everybody knew everybody. So if somebody went to my uncle, they were\u2013 they felt bad that they don\u2122t go to my father. That kind of a situation, you know? It was very bad. So on the end, he had to leave that pharmacy and he went back with my uncle, together, because, you know, there were lot of Russian people. They were non-Jews, lots. And they knew all each other. And one, oh, especially one, who let me go to the office. He had a very big position and he let me go to the office and learn the Russian typewriter. That\u2122s how I knew how to type Russian. But it came very, very good after the war, when I worked for the dictionaries. I was the only one who typed Russian in Hungary. So they were all friends, non-Jews and Jews, the Russians. Of course, they were all educated people. I\u2122m not saying that th e others were because probably they were antiSemitic, like, you know. Like it always was anti -Semitism in Russia. But they were very good friends. I never forget it, that one Christmas night, she said, \ufb01Y ou must come to our church.\ufb02 It\u2122s very interesting, the Russian Orthodox church.\ufb02 There, it was interesting. No, I don\u2122t want to hear about it, what happened with her. And it\u2122s different, I see it on the television. That it is 18 entirely different in Moscow what it was there. It was a church where you didn\u2122t have seats, you know? You were all standing and he was like th e leader there or whatever. And everybody who came in got three kisses, you know. Three times you kiss. Very friendly, very, very friendly. They were very, very nice people. And then I remember it was a photographer, Kantor (ph) was his name. And I don\u2122t know how he survived, because he was Jewish. And he survived, I don\u2122t know how. They sent him back with the non-Jews. And then my friends from Brooklyn, who knew them too, and they were in California and they met him. He was alive for a long time and he met their sons. So that kind of, you know , friends we had there, in Uzhorod."

My cousin, who was in Siberia for many years. He lived in Budapest, and one day he came to Uzhor od and he knew about the situation, that they were worried what is going to happen, because they were thrown out from Hungary. He came and he said, \ufb01I am going to adopt the children.\ufb02 Under eighteen he could have done it. \ufb01And just the name will change. They can\u2122t stay w ith you. Just God forbid something happens that the children should be safe.\ufb02 And I remember the day that they called us and they called us in the bedroom, my father and my mo ther and him. And they explai ned it to us and we started to cry. We thought that we are going to be taken aw ay from them. And we couldn\u2122t understand it. Why? Why? Why? Though I was 18 years old in 1938. But I just, we just\u2013 to take another name, and\u2013 they didn\u2122t explai n it to us, that what can happen. You know? Though we knew the story. We knew the story, but we didn\u2122t think about it, that my father was never led back to Hungary. Only my mother and us, every summer. He never was let back to Hungary to go back. And suddenly he\u2122s traveling to Hungary, because Hungary is, we are Hungary. And so after big, big discussions, we decided that we won\u2122t do it. We children didn\u2122t want to do it. And that costed my sister\u2122s life. But my sister could be saved, and he didn\u2122t want because\u2013 originally when they went to that cousin, she wanted to take my sister away, right away when she saw what\u2122s going to happen, what\u2122s happening.

She went to the camps, too. So probabl y my sister, if she would take my sister, she wouldn\u2122t be alive anyway. But she says \ufb01No. Whatever is going to happen, it\u2122s going to happen.\ufb02 But nobody knew, nobody believed it that some thing is going to happen. So, that\u2122s it."

And my, the youngest sister of my mother, Illie, Ilona , they found out that they brought up a lot of, a transport from Uzhorod to Budapest and they put them like in a jail.

And one day they let out my father with a policeman for money to my cousin\u2122s house, who wa s in Siberia. He lived very close to that place and he wasn\u2122t home already, just his wife. And nobody was in the apartment and the police brought my father there and he left, the po lice. And he says, \ufb01I come back\u2013\ufb02 this and that time.

And 23 he was just constantly questioning me. \ufb01Are you sure that that\u2122s whom you want to marry?\ufb02 Because he knew about that I went out with that boy for four years. And he said, \ufb01Are you sure, are you sure?\ufb02 And worried about me. I says, \ufb01I am not sure of nothing, but I hope it will be all right.\ufb02 And he said, I said, \ufb01Look, my aunt knows his aunt and they know the family, so I hope it will be all right.\ufb02 And he called up from Uzhorod, he called Uzhorod and he called up the senators. They were all Russians. There were many Russians, they we re non-Jews in Uzhorod. And he knew everybody. And they told him, \ufb01D on\u2122t worry, tomorrow you\u2122ll be out.\ufb02 And we parted and he says, \ufb01I hope we see each other tomorrow.\ufb02 And tomorrow came and my aunt and even my husband, he wasn\u2122t my husband at that tim e, my aunt and her husband, they all went to the train station, because they said the peopl e are going to go home by train to Uzhorod. Everybody went back, who was non-Jew. The Jews went in separate cars to Kamana Spodovski (ph) , where they killed them. And my husband, he had a very, very soft heart, like him. And he couldn\u2122t even, he couldn\u2122t see the scene. Though they went with regular cars, not like with cattle cars, but with police and whatever, soldiers, Hungarian soldiers. He run away. He couldn\u2122t see it. He just saw them from a distance. And I th ink my sister recognized him. I don\u2122t know. That was that. And then a few weeks, about two week s later, I got a card from my sister, in my sister\u2122s handwriting, that \ufb01W e are in Kamana Spodovski (ph) . We don\u2122t know what are we going to do here. We don\u2122t know if we are going to have where to stay, but we are here.\ufb02 And it was a Hungarian stamp on it, so it means that a Hungarian soldier brought it back. And what I know from the museum, that\u2122s why I went this Spring to the museum, I told you that. To find out the truth. Because she went first, my da ughter-in-law, and asked about it, and met there somebody in the library, who was very nice. A nd she, he showed her the book and he took out a few pages from the book and he made copies for me. And he sent it to me. He even spoke to me over the phone when my sister, wh en my daughter-in-law was there. And he said, it wasn\u2122t that time that they killed them. I always thought that they killed them when they left in July. When I was there, I looked at the book, but I couldn\u2122t buy it. It\u2122s such a big book. It was not only about them, because, he said, they said, and it\u2122s here and it\u2122s terrible, that 38 thousand people were killed in one day, because they didn\u2122t know what to do with them. Because they took them to Poland and the Polish people were already in ghettos that time. So they couldn\u2122t help them. Nobody could help them. And the Germans didn\u2122t know what to do with them, so they let them made their own grave, naked, like us in Auschwitz. They took the clothes away, they put them on one line and on the orders. They made a big, bi g grave and they had to make the grave. And from the other side, the German soldiers were shooting them in the graves and right away, the tanks were running over them. So I wanted that book, but it was no sense, because it was from\u2013 I have the pages what I needed. And I se e the pictures how they sit there on the end of the, the forest. And the people\u2013 and I saw the\u2013 I told you about that 12 series what was on television, The Winds of War? You never heard about The Winds of War? Mitchum played in it. It started only four series. It was a beautiful movie. It was a French-Jewish writer, who was in France and his niece was with him. You don\u2122t know that story? It\u2122s Winds of War, is the name. It\u2122s in the public library. After that they made a 12 series, 12 two hours, 12 times, the whole summer and I saw all of it. It was a H ungarian, originally he was Hungarian, an actor. And his father was amongst those people who were taken and that was his idea to make that movie. You see original pictures what the Ge rmans took. Because it starts out like a colored movie and suddenly it\u2122s black and white pictures. And you see the tr ains what we went in and I couldn\u2122t look. I said, \ufb01I see myself somewhere there.\ufb02 But when I saw, I saw the whole thing, how they killed them. And then I really co uldn\u2122t look, because I said, \ufb01My God, I am going to 24 recognize either my sister or somebody I\u2122m going r ecognize.\ufb02 I couldn\u2122t look at it. Everything is in it, from the beginning to the end, with Auschwitz, everything. Twelve series and it is in the public library, everybody can borrow it."

And when I stayed with my grandmother, and I stayed there overnight, we we re always in the basement, because they were bombing us. Terrible bombing, the Americans. They were going after the Germans, so they were bombing us. In the morning we got up and we didn\u2122t see nothing. It\u2122s very interesting that in that neighborhood it was nothing bombed, but my grandmother\u2122s sister\u2122s house. Only one 25 house was completely bombed and that\u2122s\u2013 and ever ybody is gone from that family. Only there is the girl, who is in Hungary. That was that grandmother, that was that\u2013 her grandmother. Only that house was bombed, to the ground, nothing else. And she was the only one survivor from the whole family. And she was holding ont o me, me, me, me. She wasn\u2122t married. And she survived, because her parents, when they saw what\u2122s happening, they put her in a factory, like GE. They made electric, but they worked for the army, and people who worked for the army, they didn\u2122t take them to the camps. They kept them in the factory until they finished the work. In six months they were finished, then th ey throw them out to the streets. So then she standing there, nobody, no parents and nobody, so what is she going to do? So she met her aunt\u2122s maid. She was a very nice person and she knew somebody, a lady, whose husband was in\u2013 she was not Jewish and her husband was Jewish and he was in labor camp. He died, he never came back. And that lady lived in a separa te home. She had a house and she took in a few Jewish people who didn\u2122t have where to go, who came out from the factory. And it was a doctor amongst them. And my niece, my cousin was amongst them, whom she took in. And she was hiding them. And then the neighbors went and told on her, that she is buying too much food and she\u2122s alone, that it\u2122s something going on there. And that was found, that she pulled away the beds and all of them who were there, about eigh t people, they made a bi g, big hole in the ground and they slept every night, under the bed, in the ground.

It was frightening, because I never knew that somebody can grab me. And I was afraid to go during the day through the streets, and it was a terrible life, terrible. And I was very, very depressed. And they worked on me very hard, really, that I shouldn\u2122t commit suicide, because it was terrible. Then he didn\u2122t write to me, I don\u2122t know for how long. My fianc\u00e9. So I didn\u2122t know what was going to happen. His parents were alive still and they lived in Eger, because they took away already the farm. So they lived with the daughter. She had a very big house. A part of the house belonged to my husband, because that was an inherited house. She inherited it. She went, can you imagine that she went to a convent to school, because that was the best school there. And she was the only Jewish girl. At that time she was Jewish. And when she was 18 years old and she came out, she met that guy. She had a lot of Jewish doctors, who wanted to marry he r. She met that guy, who was a gorgeous guy and he had three kinds of doctorate, and he had a big, big job with the states. And he fell in love with her. And they were the biggest anti-Semites. Hi s father\u2013 I told you that? His father left a will, though his granddaughter was born already Christian, that his granddaughter cannot come to his funeral. That kind of a man she married. A nd she was going to the Catholic Church and everything. And they lived together there. The parents had a separate part of the house and they lived together. But when everything was happening, he didn\u2122t save the parents. He saved his wife and the daughter, but he didn\u2122t save the parents, because he, himself, was an anti-Semite. I know. I know, because he made once a remark, that I couldn\u2122t believe it. They had my stuff, 26 because I left it by Christian friends. A lot of personal things. And when my husband was transferred to Budapest, I told him where the stuff is and he took it away and sent it to the sister. So whatever is saved, first they saved it, our friends, but then my sister-in-law saved it. So she had everything what was my dowry, my jewelr y and everything. So, he didn\u2122t want it, you know, it was his. He didn\u2122t want to give it back to me. And they said they don\u2122t have it. And one day they weren\u2122t home and I go to the clos et and I pulled out everything what was mine. That was the story. So it was terrible, terrible, really terrible. And I know that he made antiSemitic remarks in front of me. And I know that he was an anti-Semite."

And that tube was put 30 on my chest, on my heart and the water was circula ting in it. That was the treatment. And that was\u2013 I thought it was a heart attack, because it di dn\u2122t want to go out. For three weeks it didn\u2122t go down, the pulse. And then I had another thing in 1942, that was terrible too. I had the appendix taken out and I couldn\u2122t have it done under my name. I didn\u2122t go to the hospital. And I went with my mother\u2122s, with my mother\u2122s oldest sister, whose son was in Siberia. And I went under her name to the hospital. It was a privat e hospital. And the doctor was a private doctor, who, he was a gynecologist. Because I was constantly complaining about pain and pain and pain and pain and he just couldn\u2122t find out what is it. And one day my husband was there visiting. It wasn\u2122t my husband at that time. And I just wa s like in two, I had such a pain. And his office was in my, my grandmother, where my grandmot her lived, in that house was his office. And I went to him and I said, \ufb01I tell you the diagnosis. I tell you what I have.\ufb02 He says, \ufb01What, what are you talking about?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01That must be appendix.\ufb02 And he says, \ufb01God, you are right.\ufb02 And he took me to a private hosp ital to Budapest and they started to operate on me. And it was under my aunt\u2122s name. I was Halas (ph) . That\u2122s his grandson is Halas, who is in Canada. And I went under that name. And the operation was so long, they didn\u2122t know what happened there, that the doctors are running for more anesthesia. And my aunt is sta nding there and didn\u2122t know what happened. My appendix was completely, completely curled up with my colons and it was a very, very long operation. And my heart, it was weak. They took me home by ambulance after. But next morning, six o\u2122clock in the morning, the doctor is there. And he lived, that was in Budapest, in the city, the hospital. And we lived in New Pest, so it was a big distant. I says, \ufb01I am so sick that you are here?\ufb02 He says, \ufb01N o, no, don\u2122t worry. I just wanted to know how you feel.\ufb02 Then I found out what was happening and they had to take me home by ambulance. And it was in \u201a42. And in \u201a44 I have an unusual big cut and that\u2122s how I went to Mengele. So I thought that that will matter when he sees that. But you know what was interesting? That I had a friend, she was a woman, who had a mastectomy and she survived. And Mengele saw it and she survived. So they were very odd things. And she came to Canada and she died in Canada. It was a terrible thing. Her son is an engineer. He and my cousin, in Hungary, they went together to the\u2013 they started the engineering colle ge together. Her son and my cousin, who is in Canada, that lady\u2122s son. And they lived in Montreal. And my cousin lived in Montreal at the beginning. He went to McGill (ph) to finish his degree. And we went to visit her, the lady, and she was alive for a few years. And once her son had to go to Paris, to France for business. I don\u2122t know what kind of engineer is he, because mi ne is a chemical engineer. I don\u2122t know what kind of engineer he\u2013 and while he was away, she got the pneumonia and she died. They had to call him home. She lived togeth er with the son and with daughter-in-law. She married a Hungarian girl. He wasn\u2122t Jewish. She was Je wish, the woman. Her husband wasn\u2122t Jewish, so the son wasn\u2122t Jewish. So she married a Hungari an, non-Jewish girl, who was already in Canada at that time. And she spoke perfect French a nd she worked for the telephone company. Very nice person. We went there three times to visit her. And for longest time, they couldn\u2122t\u2013 he retired. They couldn\u2122t sell their house. And two years ago they wrote me a letter, \ufb01Finally we sold the house and we moved to Kingston.\ufb02 It\u2122s Canada, but it\u2122s very close to the border. And it\u2122s a beautiful place. And they live there. They have two children. And he said, \ufb01My son married a French woman with a daughter.\ufb02 Th e son. A French woman, who has a daughter. And the girl, she was a, they wanted a child very badly and finally she became pregnant and she was a premature baby. And she was very small, so they didn\u2122t know that she survive. She survived and she went to college and then she became the hostess on the Canadian Cruise Line, for\u2013 I don\u2122t know how long she did it. They were always\u2013 every Christmas they write me and 31 I write them. That\u2122s how I know about them. But when they lived in Montreal, they went, many times, my cousin and they were friends. But si nce that time, I know only from Christmas cards what is happening to them. And what\u2122s interesting, my cousin\u2122s son went to McGill, too. And they live in Toronto. But they stayed there and he went to McGill. And he finished psychiatry. And he wants to\u2013 I don\u2122t know how they are doing it, it\u2122s not a bad idea\u2013 be a lawyer and a psych, psychologist, psychologist and a lawyer. So, he\u2122s going to law school in Kingston, where they live now. You know. The father\u2122s friends. He\u2122s going to Kingston, to law school. It\u2122s interesting. I don\u2122t know whether they see each other. I don\u2122t know what he was writing me about it. I have to call them Sunday, I don\u2122t kno w. I call Sundays only because it is cheaper."

And he was tel ling me, \ufb01If not me, she would be dead ten years ago.\ufb02 I think she had cancer of the liver, because on the end they had to operate on her.

She called him from every meeting and everywhere, \ufb01Come right away beca use mother has fever,\ufb02 and right away the injection. Unbelievable. She was a very good daughter.

And in \u201a82, June, he says, \ufb01I\u2122m going to see my sister.\ufb02 And I spoke, I knew that three-qu arter of his heart was gone. And I spoke to his doctor, I says, \ufb01What should I do? How shall I te ll him that he cannot go ?\ufb02 He says, \ufb01You know what, he can go. He has a doctor there. He will be safe. But he cannot go rowing around nowhere in Europe. He goes to one place and he can go. And June 13 th is his birthday, but I called him many times. But I called hi m on his birthday. I\u2122m sorry, June 17 th. He was born, 1913, 17.

They were there already, here in 1979. And we met there and I spend one week vacation there, because Ilona was born third of July. And we spend her birthday. And my husband came back end of June to spend the week in the country for her birthday. And after that, we supposed to go to Canada, all of us by car. And he said, \ufb01You know what? I came from a big trip. You go with them to Canada.\ufb02 And she was pregnant with Anna that time. She was pregnant with Anna, Ilona. She knew that he wanted, because he always wanted children and the two died. He always wanted children, so at least George should have more child ren. So she was pregnant with her, and we went to Canada. He said, \ufb01You go to Canada and I go home.\ufb02 A nd he was alone, traveling home. And then I got a call from him in Canada that please bring a pres ent to one of my co-workers. I says, \ufb01Why to her?\ufb02 She says, \ufb01Because I was sick and she took me to the hospital.\ufb02 So we packed and we 34 came right back.

I was working and after work I went to the dentist and I had to have a tooth pulled. And he was very upset about that and he came with me. I went by bus. They had private buses, because I went to the city periodontist. And he came to the door and he looked so beautiful. He had brown pants and a yellow shirt on. And he said , \ufb01Nothing, nothing hurts me,\ufb02 because he had back trouble, too. He had a spine operation. He said, \ufb01Nothing, nothing hurts me.\ufb02 And you know, you don\u2122t think if it\u2122s about your own, that the last day when you live, nothing will hurt you. And that\u2122s true.

But the closest was to me alwa ys Ilona, because when they took my mother and 36 they killed them in, my parent s in 1941. So, she was the one who was unbelievably helping me. And then the last year, before the Nazis came in, she didn\u2122t let me go to hiding and she said, \ufb01You are our child, no matter what. You stay with us.\ufb02 And so for one year I was with them until they took us all. And after, when she survived and I survived and her husband survived, but not her son. And my son was born. To my son she was like a grandmother. So when we left, we left to Vienna and we left them in Hungar y, but we knew that they are coming after us, three weeks. Because they had, they were elderly people already and they ha d visa to Israel and England and we knew that they are going to come . And the time came then we came to America and we left them there. And my son, he was so blaming me and he was so crying. How can I do it, to leave them there? He wa s nine years old. He was the only relative whom he knew. Like, she took care of him when I had to go to work. Because under the communism we had to work. And she was everything to him. And my hear t was going out and I was explaining to him, \ufb01When we get to America and we become citizens we are going to bring\u2013\ufb02 and that was the plan, that we are going to bring them over. But she died, unfortunately, from a gall bladder operation. But I think that she had already liver cancer, but they don\u2122t tell me, because nobody dies from a gall bladder operation. It must ha ve gone to the liver and the operation was okay. She was alive for a few days. And one day my un cle and his brother went to visit her. They went every day, but one day when they went, she was dead. I didn\u2122t go, to the funeral. Because we were here in \u201a58 and that was in \u201a63 and in \u201a59 I got a job in the hospital when I was working and I says, \ufb01We don\u2122t have either the money for th e three of us to go,\ufb02 so we couldn\u2122t go. But it was in the summertime and George was with some of our friends in the country. They were having a bungalow they rented and we went over on the weekends. We went to Poughkeepsie. And he was there and I was afraid to tell him. I was afraid to tell him. And he wrote to his pediatrician in New York, who was the head of the Pediatrics in the hospital where I worked, and asked him to find out from me the truth, because he thinks that something is very wrong. And he showed me the letter and he said, \ufb01You have to tell him.\ufb02 So, I was very, very upset to tell him. And I found it out, my husband did, he got the letter and he didn\u2122t want to tell me. And we are driving out to the country and when he told me, we made an accident with the car. I was, you know, so upset, we made\u2013 and it was an old car and we had the first car. It was a big Pontiac. But somebody ran into us. It wasn\u2122t our fault, and he ran away. The guy ran away. But I was so upset that how I am going to tell him, because it was like the end of the world. He didn\u2122t know no one from the family and he was the kid of the family, because his brother, my uncle\u2122s brother lost his four-years-old child and the second wife never could have children. So he\u2122s named after my, Ilika\u2122s son, he was George, too. And he was everybody\u2122s child, only child. And when I had the other little boy, he was five months old when he died. I named him after the four-years-old, who died. He was Paul, he was Paul, my little one, who died in one day from the croup."

How many people, one day they were killed, because they were not only from Czechoslova kia, that part where we lived, but they were from Romania, what belonged once to Hungary, where Elie Wiesel comes from. They were people from there, too. And they were there, too. So they were, I think, 38,000 in one day they killed. Because they took them to Poland firs t, no, I know from them.

Before that, they had a dinner in the club, but it was 150 dollars a plate, and I didn\u2122t have 150 dollars for a dinner. And people were coming out and they were telling him what a wonderful thing it was just to shake hands with him. And I was very upset that I know that man from my co-worker, who was a very good friend, her father was very good friend, her husband, of Elie Wiesel and I couldn\u2122t see him. I couldn\u2122t talk to him. So when it was everything over, Ana was telling me, \ufb01Wait, wa it, maybe you can see it, go to his dressing room.\ufb02 So, a gentleman was sta nding there from UK, they didn\u2122t let nobody to see him.

She is the only survivor here in Lexington and she would like to talk to him, only for a few minutes.\ufb02 So he says, \ufb01Yes, I will do it, but she has to wait until the hall is empty, because if people see somebody\u2122s going, they want to go, too.\ufb02 So, I was waiting, I says, \ufb01I gladly wait.\ufb02 So, I was waiting and he helped me down the steps, because they were wooden st eps in the basement.

I couldn\u2122t believe it. I said, \ufb01You speak still Hungarian?\ufb02 Because he didn\u2122t, I mean, I don\u2122t know where he learned, because where he was, they were very religious people, his parents. And I think they spoke Yiddish and not Hungarian, but he spoke Hungarian. And he was 15 years old, maybe in school, correct, in school, probably he learned. He spoke wonderful. And he says, \ufb01No, I can, because I have no 43 one to talk to.\ufb02 His wife is French. I says, \ufb01Don\u2122t tell me, you speak Hungarian.\ufb02 And from then on he spoke Hungarian to me.

And they had from that part of the town, Sighet (ph) , they had an organization. And that my friend\u2122s husband went always there because he loved him. And she then was telling me what went on in that organization and what happened at that organization [laughing] when they were together, so I knew a lot about him. And I was telling it to him.

A nd here too, in Lexington School, they are very, very\u2013 I spoke twice already there. And now I, the teacher was always asking me whether I know a book for children. I am reading now in a magazine that he, Elie Wiesel, wrote his first children\u2122s book about the Holocaust with pict ures. So, I try to get that book and I try to call that teacher in Lexington School, because she is very intelligent. She is teaching fifth graders. And they understood it. What kind of letters I got from them, from the fifth\u2013 I just cannot believe it, how they understood it and how sorry they are for me. And they cannot believe it, that I lived through that. Fifth graders. So I tell you the truth, that I spoke about 150, 160 times since I am here. That if I cannot do it, because I will be the most unhappiest person in the world, because I feel the commitment that I ha ve to do it. I still have to do it, because there are many, many people, who don\u2122t know it still and those are adults, mostly adults. The children are starting to know me in schools, because I go back always, because they are different classes, and most of them they know. In the colleges, too. I was all over in every college, Berea, Midway, and the private colle ge, Transylvania, twice, UK three times. Community college. So, they know all ready. But the adults, lot of adults, in churches, they don\u2122t know. So, I will be really\u2013 and even if th ey call me to schools, next graders who didn\u2122t hear me and I cannot do it, I am depressed and I always think about it. That it give me\u2013 I cannot explain it, when I talk, I am very enthusiastic and I live it through again. That\u2122s true. And I have to take a tranquilizer, I must take before I go. And I never spoke about my parents, because I couldn\u2122t. I was always crying. And la tely I am even showing the pictures of my parents. And if they give me enough time to te ll them that story on the end, I am including it, what happened to them and I am showing their pict ures. And I was so relieved that I did it. Okay, I didn\u2122t sleep at night, but I was relieved that I did something good for them who died. You know? I took it in my head that they died a nd they won\u2122t be at peace until the last survivor is going to tell their story. It\u2122s\u2013 I cannot explain it, what happened to me, because I never spoke. I never spoke."

A very beautiful place. And he took us for an apartment, a rental, close to them. And it was a woman, whose husband was a school principal, but they were divorced. And she had a son, an engineer and he didn\u2122t live home and she had three rooms, two bedrooms and a living room. One bedr oom was separate and then she had a room in Bolotow (ph) , near Lake Bolotow (ph) , that she went there. If she rented the apartment she went there, th at she shouldn\u2122t be home. But we were always begging her, that it doesn\u2122t bother us, she should stay home. B ecause she was the only person who spoke English and Ilona could spoke to her English. She was the only person. And she worked for the\u2013 she was babysitting in the Canadian Embassy for somebody. So, she spoke English well. We were glad when she stayed home and when she st ayed home she went down and she brought us always fresh bread and milk, and she was very nice to us. We didn\u2122t speak about religion, absolutely. And the last day, the last day before we left, she came to me and she said, \ufb01I didn\u2122t sleep the whole night.\ufb02 I says, \ufb01Why?\ufb02 She sa ys, \ufb01Because I just find out, I just notice your number that you are Jewish and I am Jewi sh, too. Nobody knows it in the house.\ufb02 In 1989, nobody knows it in the house. \ufb01They are suspicious,\ufb02 she said. But her husband, I don\u2122t know. I don\u2122t remember already her name. But it was a Hungarian name. But he changed his name because it was a Jewish name. He changed it wh en he was a school principal. And once, she was telling that she was here in America in Los Angeles for a month and she\u2122s mentioning a name, who invited her. And I knew them, those pe ople, that they were Jewish people. In New Pest, you know? But still I just di dn\u2122t realize it that she\u2122s Jewish. And she wouldn\u2122t ask me and I wouldn\u2122t ask her. But one day, she wasn\u2122t home and I see\u2013 I took the mail, and a letter came from Israel. And when I gave it to her, she ri ght away put it in her pocket. Because she knew that my sister-in-law was convert ed and married to a non-Jew and she got that apartment and she thought we are not Jewish. She was afraid to say that she is Jewish. So then\u2013 it was unbelievable. And when we came home, I sent her some nylon panty hose because she couldn\u2122t get it. And for two or three years I was writing her. And I didn\u2122t realize it, she said, \ufb01I mentioned to you so many times who took me, who took me, who invited me\u2013\ufb02 and her son was there too. I don\u2122t know how long he was in Los Angeles, in California. And I didn\u2122t realize it, he went out once with that man, but he wa s married.

But many people worked there, they were all intellectuals, because they were\u2013 whatever we ha d intellectually, if it\u2122s something medical, the doctors that were there and engineers or whatever. It\u2122s very interesting. And he, on the biggest holiday, Yom Kippur, he called us to his office, me and his secretary and he made us eat. He was in the Party, the Communist Party because of his job. But who saw it? Why did he have to do it? I couldn\u2122t go to the syna gogue, so I went home by bus, I re member. Because it was, we lived in New Pest and that was in mid-town. We were passing the street where the synagogue is, I jumped off the bus at that station and after work I went to the synagogue. And in the concentration camp I didn\u2122t know that it\u2122s holiday or not holiday, but the Polish people knew it. And they were telling us when it\u2122s Yom Kippur. They knew it from outside the world. Because people who went to work outside, they somehow got in touch with Polish people. And then they said that tomorrow is like Yom Kippur, so I didn\u2122t eat. I was used not to eat, because eat, the food was only bread when we got off from th e work, you know? I was fasting there and I go back and I have to eat."

They were religious and not religious. We didn\u2122t have nothing to eat. So my sister-in-law managed to buy every year a\u2013 she was close to the countryside and everybody knew them there where they lived. Her husband had a very big position with the state. And he, himself, was an anti-Semite, my sister-in-law\u2122s husband. It\u2122s unbelievable. I was telling you about it. Okay. But they managed, somehow, I don\u2122t know how\u2013 we got every year a pig. Pig! So, and it was a butcher, who came to the house, and they made for us and for Ilona, for them\u2013 my uncle wasn\u2122t alive at that time, Joseph. Because he was very religious, you wouldn\u2122t believe it that he went with a little prayer book to Buchenwald and he managed to bring it back wi th him. Because that time already, they weren\u2122t killing there, in Buchenwald, when he got there. And he brought it back. He was very religious. That\u2122s why he stayed with us, and not with Illie, Ilona, b ecause of the pork. But we ate the pork, too. We had it, too. Especially when he died, it was\u2013 we ate it because there was nothing else, and we had food for the whole year. George doesn\u2122t kno w it. He doesn\u2122t remember it, so I am not telling it to him. And I am not telling it even to the grandchildren. Ana is crazy when she would hear it. She\u2122s watching always what you are ordering. She is\u2013 yeah. But he was the president of the synagogue, my uncle, and he was helping many, many Jewish, young boys to go to Israel. That time it was secret. Secretly, they went through Czechoslovakia. So, that way he was religious, but, you know? But we co uldn\u2122t show it that we were religious or not religious. But we ate pork. But I got back my religion. I got my belief. I got it back slowly, slowly I got it back. I was always thinking about my mother, how he taught us, she taught us to pray in Czechoslovakia. And when we went to the synagogue like Friday night or something, I was always thinking about it, how we were crying, but every week we had to read one more page. And it was so hard for us, myself and my sister . And I was thinking about them. And as I was thinking about them always, you know, I got back my religion. And especially when I came to America. When I came to America and my uncl e was\u2013 he wasn\u2122t, he ate everything. I\u2122m not saying that they didn\u2122t cook pork, but he was religious. And I remember him and my father when they were together and Passover, when they were together. And every Saturday they went to the synagogue and then they came to us and they were singing after lunch those songs that you are supposed to. And when I thought about those things it came back to me, you know? It\u2122s very interesting. And now I love to go to the synagogue, and I am so heartbroken. I wasn\u2122t there now three weeks, I think. I am missing it. A nd I\u2122m missing it. We don\u2122t have a rabbi now. He left. I loved him. It\u2122s interesting that he\u2122s near Cincinnati and Ilona was teaching here Sunday school art for four years. And now he\u2122s teaching in his new\u2013 she goes down to the new congregation and she\u2122s teaching, but only twice a month because it\u2122s 40 miles away. So, and it\u2122s, but\u2013 she sees him. And I cannot see th em. I was very good friends with\u2013 she\u2122s a very young woman. His wife is from Ci ncinnati. He\u2122s from Minnesota, the rabbi. And his parents 47 were Czechoslovakians, Czechs. His father, I me t his father many times, he\u2122s an optometrist. When he came visit he still speak Czech."

The Jews are always the [laughing]\u2013 for everywhere and everything they are blaming the Jews. So, it \u2122s no answer. It\u2122s no answer. First the Blacks came and after that the Jews. Some places they\u2013 when they are no Blacks, there are no Blacks, then there are the Jews the first who are blamed for everything. Why? Does anybody knows why? I lived under democracy in Czechoslovaki a. It was a real, real democracy. Nobody knows what\u2122s democracy. Only if somebody lived under that time Masaryk and Benes. They always said, \ufb01We cannot be anti-Semitic, neve r.

And th en when he knew what they are doing and why, then they killed them and he wanted to have it. Why are they anti, I don\u2122t know, anti-Semitic here, I don\u2122t know. I never heard it from no one, but I can imagine that th e Southern Baptist are anti-Semitic. I am thinking it only because I was invited [laughing] to every church, every denomination, but never to a Baptist church. So it must be something against the Jews. They won\u2122t say it to your face, but it must be. They know it. They saw me in the paper. They know it. And I was never, never, and I was on every Christian church. What is that?

We worked and we were communist, but we worked. I mean, the wealthy people were very afraid and we were very afraid with my uncle, that they are going to ta ke them. Because they came at night. They knocked on the doors, and taked people on they, on their cars, on their\u2013 the Russians, with machine guns. And they took them to villages, and th ey took them to villages and they left them. There were certain villages where they were designated where they took the wealthy people. And they couldn\u2122t come back to Budapest. But thank God, thank God it never happened. Because that was against\u2013 again, it was somebody had to tell them who are the wealthy people. And they were in very good friendship with everybody from the higher-ups there. Because that was a borough, New Pest, where we lived. And like New York has five boroughs, the same thing Budapest has. And so they knew everybody, and they were friends with everybody, and so nobody told on them, so they weren\u2122t taken away . Their business was taken away, but they didn\u2122t. They weren\u2122t taken away. What was done to them, they had to move together, the two families, in one apartment, because it was too big for two people. Gorgeous apartment. House. And they took away they apartment and they had to live together, the sister-in-laws and brother-in-law, two brothers. And they had to rent the upstairs apartment. They d ecided that they\u2122d take the first floor and the second floor, it was a doctor, a gynecologist with his family. But they didn\u2122t take them out. And from that, that they take out ma ny wealthy people, many wealthy people married non-Jews, but not that non-Jews, bu t it wasn\u2122t a match. Just only because those people were giving them stay, somewhere to stay. Because it is an example, my cousin, I have a second cousin in Budapest, my mother and her mo ther were sisters, cousins. I\u2122m sorry, first cousins. And she is the only one who survived from that family, nobody. She had two uncles and the grandmothers were sisters, my grandmot her and her grandmother were sisters and that\u2122s how the mothers were first cousins, my mother and her mother.

I think, in fact, now after the war, they are together, Tungsraum and General Electric. Something, I don\u2122t know. But young girls, they worked there. And when they took her parents, she was working there and they slept there and everything. So they worked for the army and when they finished with the work, when the work was finished, they let them go. But they didn\u2122t have where to go, because they were, nobody was there already, we were all gone. And that\u2122s\u2013 I think I, somewhere I said that story, that she was hiding. One of her aunts had a maid and she recommended where to go, to a woman, who was non-Jewish and he r husband was Jewish and he was in labor camp. And she had a house.

And we were in the apartment and basements were on the other side of the build ing, the basements, and we had to run to the other side with the children. I had at that time my cousin\u2122s, who was in Russia, his two daughters. They were with us because they went somewhere for vacation and it happened under the vacation. And they lived far, very far from us. They lived in Buda, what was very far from us and they couldn\u2122t pick up the children. And they stayed with us, two little girls. We had to go to the basement because they were shelling in the backyard. Terrible. I don\u2122t know how many nights we spent in the basement. When it stopped, when they already were in control, I don\u2122t know how long it took them. It took them a long time, and they were in control. Then Austria opened the borders, their borders and people who lived close, they could just walk over to Austria. And thousands and thousands, and mostly the peasants, because they were all farmlands around the border, you know? They went all over to Austria and in Austria they put up camps for them and America was sending money for it. We were far away, we couldn\u2122t go, because we were 400 miles away from the border, in Budapest . So we couldn\u2122t go. That story is in. How did I get out, and the Russians. That\u2122s in."

But I wanted to ask you whether you wanted to say anything about your husband and your relationship with him, because last time we talked you said he was a stranger to you and then all of sudden you met him after the war.",
            "answer": "He was a stranger to me in that way, that I kne w him for three weeks, when he wanted to marry me. And then he couldn\u2122t marry me because I was underage. And then they took him in labor camp. He was away, and I don\u2122t know, a few tim es he wrote me cards. But I didn\u2122t know what\u2122s going to happen, whether he stays with me whether he will wait for me. And he was four years in labor camps, so I didn\u2122t know what\u2122s going to happen. But I really\u2013 that\u2122s why I say that I really didn\u2122t know him. I told you a bout the other boy, whom I went with somebody for four years. So, I was very mixed up. I was very mixed up. I don\u2122t know whether I fell in love with my husband right away. But my heart wa s broken when the other one find out and then wrote me a letter, \ufb01Why did I do it?\ufb02 If he woul d know that I need a name, he would marry me right away. And\u2013 but it was late already, everything was arranged that he fell in love with me, my husband. So\u2013 he was seven years older, and I knew he was very good looking. And I knew who was the family, first of all, because my a unt and his aunt were very good friends. So, I 51 knew the family from my own\u2013 and I didn\u2122t know what\u2122s going to be, and when I met him, you know, when we came back, I was te rribly crying and he was crying, too. But he knew I\u2122m alive. He knew, because he knew months ago already when they got the notice. But he was waiting for me. But I wasn\u2122t sure whether he has somebody in between or not, though we got married. We were married in 1944, in February, when we got married. For two weeks we were together and that was that. And I was always, you know, afraid that they are going to take me still. I am married, but we went to a hotel, I remember on the marriage night. It was unbelievable. We went down to eat. It was in the city, a beautiful hotel. And everybody constantly was afraid that they are coming and asking for identif ication and that kind of a thing. It was horrible. So I said, \ufb01Let\u2122s check out. I don\u2122t want to stay here.\ufb02 We went back. We went back, and we stayed with my grandmother, and then we stayed with Ilika, too, with Ilona. Ilika is a, in Hungarian, I don\u2122t know what it is in any language. If somebody has a na me, they make it like softer. Ilika is softer than Ilona. You know? But that\u2122s from Ilona, so we called her Ilika. And I was Milika, my name was Millie, I mean my nickname is Mi llie. Nobody knew me as Emilie, only in school, and at work. But otherwise, the whole family and my friends\u2013 and then we came to America, I didn\u2122t know that it\u2122s an American name, too. A nd I never mentioned it. It was always Emilie and that was it. But my friends are still ca lling me Millie on the phone and my cousin and everybody is calling me. I have a cousin in Canada . My cousin who was eight years in Siberia, seven years, from \u201a41 to \u201a48. He has a son. And he escaped after \u201a56, they sent him, the parents. He went to University at that time already, two y ears as an engineer. And he was, when he came back he was a communist. He wasn\u2122t a communist, he was in the party and because of that, that he was in Russia and spoke already Russian, he got a very big job in the Ministry. He was\u2013 as an engineer. He knew that he never can come to America, because he was in the Communist Party. So when it was finished, the communism , when the\u2013 I mean, when they opened the borders, he sent his son alone to Vienna. But he had to go to Israel, because the plan was that the parents are going to come after him to Israel. They knew that he cannot come to America. We weren\u2122t here. And so he went alone to Israel, but the mother had there a lot of friends, his mother, and he stayed with the friends. And he went to the Israeli Army and he was an officer, too. And the parents went after him, they got pa ssport. Parents and two sisters, who were born after he came home, the two sisters. But he escaped with his mothe r\u2122s mother\u0160grandmother, grandfather and he\u0160they escaped the middle of Budapest. I don\u2122t know whether you heard about Wallenberg, that Swedish man? He was hi ding them. He was from that group and his mother, and his grandmother and grandfather. Gra ndmother. Grandfather di ed before they went to Israel. The grandmother went with them to Isra el and she died in Israel. My cousin went with them. I mean of course he went with them. He di ed in Israel. And it is very interesting that his father was in the First World War and he got\u2013 he was in Siberia, too, his father. And he got a nerve disease, nerves. It was terrible. I remember him very well. That was my mother\u2122s sister\u2122s husband. And he got the same disease in Isra el. He was a young man. He was 60, 62 when he died. And he got a job as an engineer, but in a different field. It was a margarine factory where he was in engineering, like making colognes and that kind of, you know? Entirely different. But they were okay. Her father gave a lot of money to Israel, so they were okay in Israel. The two sisters, my cousin\u2122s two sisters were in Israel, the two sisters. And the mother, she was here. When she was 75 years old, she came to Canada a nd she came to me here and it was winter and she says, \ufb01God, I love to see the snow. I never sn ow since I am in Israel.\ufb02 It was a big snow when she was here. And she spent her 75th birthday here. And two years later she died. She had 52 diabetes and she didn\u2122t take care of herself. She ate everything in the world, but she lived well. I spoke to her daughter and she said, \ufb01That\u2122s the only thing, we are happy that she lived well.\ufb02"

            "question": "Let\u2122s go back, because we got off the subject, you were talking about your relationship with your husband.",
            "answer": "So again. So, I wasn\u2122t, when I came back. So I said, this was a long, long time. I don\u2122t know, maybe he find somebody. I don\u2122t know. I was two w eeks his wife, that\u2122s it. I got back. I met him before they came, before they took us, he came to the ghetto. I told you that. But it was just that, nothing, no relationship, we just met. [L aughing.] And then he left the ghetto and five minutes later we were surrounded. But he was tel ling me that, \ufb01Don\u2122t let you take them to the wagons.\ufb02 I didn\u2122t know what he\u2122s talking about. He saw it on the way from Romania, of course, Romania, it was near the border there where th ey were. What they are doing, they\u2122re putting people\u2013 and when the wagons came, I remember ed his words, I says, \ufb01Don\u2122t let you put yourself \u2013\ufb02 Does he know that there are guns involved here? He didn\u2122t know that it was done with machine guns. But he told me that \ufb01You ar e going to get a Christian birth certificate and you come with me.\ufb02 It was true, everything. I told you that I find the birth certificate here. I didn\u2122t know about it. Last time when he was in Hungary he brought everything. His sister was very sick for ten years, but her son-in-law is a doctor and he kept her alive. Because he was telling me when we were there, if not me, she wouldn\u2122t be alive anymore. Because the daughter was always hysterical and even from meetings she called him. He was in a hospital like here, Walter Reed. He was there, a pathologist, under the Communism. So, he had a big job. And she called him, \ufb01Right away come and give moth er injections,\ufb02 she yelled. And I was there when she did it. And he right away left everything, came and gave her injections. I think that she had liver cancer, that\u2122s what I think. Because she had diabetes, diabetes, I don\u2122t know whether it counts for me, that that family had di abetes, but my father\u2122s sister had diabetes in Russia. So it was in the family. I always for got about it and when they were asking me, \ufb01Did anybody have it in the family?\ufb02 And I always sa y, \ufb01I don\u2122t know, they were killed when they were 45 years old.\ufb02 And I know my grandmother didn\u2122t have it. I know the other sister didn\u2122t have it. At that time I probably\u2013 I didn\u2122t know even that his sister had it, because she was writing, my father, always to his sister. And he translated the letters to us, but I didn\u2122t think about it, you know, that she had it. And now he was telling me, my cousin, that she had even a leg amputated because of diabetes. So it is in my family. But I don\u2122t know whether I got it. I don\u2122t know. Because it was really, I had such a good doctor for 27 years and he never said that\u2122s diabetes. Only my periodontist always said that I have diabetes because of my gums. It was always, he said, \ufb01What are they talking about, yo u have diabetes?\ufb02 And he always said, \ufb01No, you don\u2122t have diabetes, it\u2122s just elevated because of the medications what you are taking.\ufb02 Here the urologist was arguing with me, that I don\u2122t ha ve\u2013 I had urinary tract infection. And he said, \ufb01You don\u2122t have diabetes. What are they talking about? Because it\u2122s not in your urine.\ufb02 Would you believe that? Well, anyway. So then, when we lived in Eger, and we started to know each other. And right away, I got pregnant, a month la ter I got pregnant. We got very close and he was a very, very good man. Very good. He had such a heart. He was so good. He never said, like George, he never said nothing bad about nobody. And he tried to help people and he was a person like, he worked in a hospital, and he\u2013 like nobody, you know\u2013 even in New York they don\u2122t care about the Blacks. He shook hands with the elevator man or whatever. You know? He was unbelievable good. Unbelievable. And when he retired, even before he retired, he went 53 without me to Hungary, because I right away ha d four weeks vacation with the hospital. And when he retired, he went every year back to Hungary to see his sister. But the main thing to see the children\u2122s grave. And one day I told him, \ufb01Listen Frank, you see I am the mother. You think that I don\u2122t think about them?\ufb02 I says, \ufb01You go only to the stones. You must realize it, that you go only to the stones.\ufb02 He says, \ufb01Yes, but at leas t I can fix up the letters if they are, you know, not in shape.\ufb02 They are not buried separate. They are buried with my Uncle Joseph, in the same grave, the two little kids. And then that was that reason, that he has an only sister and she\u2122s very sick. And then when he was very sick, he had a terrible heart attack in \u201a81 and in \u201a82, 17 months he lived. And in between that he went to Hungar y. I said to the doctor, \ufb01What shall I tell him, that he cannot go?\ufb02 He says, \ufb01No, he can go, but he cannot go around nowhere else, just to Hungary. And he\u2122ll be all right there because hi s nephew is a doctor and he will be very safe there.\ufb02 And I called him every w eek on the phone. And he said, \ufb01I\u2122m fine, I\u2122m fine.\ufb02 Threequarters of his heart was gone. \ufb01I am fine,\ufb02 he sa id. And I always gave the report to the doctor. And he says, \ufb01He\u2122s fine because probably he sees sicker people around him, and then he has the nephew there\ufb02. And that was the reason, because when he came back in July, end of June\u2013 every July we were in the country for Ilona\u2122s, Ilona was born July 3rd, and I left a week vacation for that, and we went to the country house, and he came back before that and he came with us and he was fine. We wanted to go, all of us, to Cana da after. It\u2122s not close, but it\u2122s on the same highway to go to Toronto, where it\u2122s close, like a country house. It was a long ride, but still it was\u2013 I don\u2122t know about four, 500 hundred miles, through Niagara Falls. We wanted to all of us go, and he said, \ufb01You know what? I came from a long trip now, I go home myself. I drive home myself. And you go with them.\ufb02 Laura wa s pregnant with Ana. And he was so happy, because he always wanted a lot of children. He was crazy for children. And George was an only child, because the two others died. And he always , he was very happy. He loved them so much. That\u2122s the last picture from them before he left. That was onl y Jacob and Ilona. And he\u2013 it was in April. No. No, because George took him to the ai rport. It was before he left. He died in \u201a82. While we were in Canada, he got sick and he went himself to the hospital. They took him in Intensive Care, Coronary Care, I don\u2122t even know. But I called him when he was already home. And he said, \ufb01Bring a present to so and so.\ufb02 I says, \ufb01Why?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Because he helped me. I was in the hospital.\ufb02 So right away I packed and I went back. And in August he died. I wasn\u2122t even around. You know that story? It was terr ible. He was so good. And he was so worried about me, because when I was sick, he didn\u2122t get undressed. He was\u2013 the whole\u2013 because I had two heart attacks, in \u201a67 and in \u201a70. So, it was always me they were worried about. So, he was always, he didn\u2122t get undressed and he was\u2013 unbelievable nurse, you know? He was very, very good. And with the children, everything they\u2013 what we had, and every vacation they were always for those two children, because they lived upstairs. They lived in the same house. He loved them. He loved George. He loved them. He was very upset that he\u2122s an artist, because he thought that, he always of the Hungarian artist, and he was always telling them, \ufb01You know how the artists are living? They are going baref oot because they don\u2122t have money for they\u2013\ufb02 [Laughing.] You know, he was always worried. But when he said that \ufb01Don\u2122t worry, I am going to teach.\ufb02 Then he was very happy, and he was always the first one whom George called. That \ufb01I got tenure, I got even\u2013\ufb02 no, he wasn\u2122t alive when he got full professor, only when he got tenure. He was alive. And he was very happy, and with every exhibition, though he didn\u2122t like his paintings. But he said he loves it, because he went from that kind of a, ultra-modern. But he was supporting him. And that wa s everything for him, George was everything. That\u2122s why we bought the house there, that he should have a studio. But he always said to him, \ufb01If you want to 54 be a real artist, don\u2122t get married.\ufb02 But he wanted to be an artist, but he\u2013 I mean, he didn\u2122t have no one else but us, that was a fam ily, so he wanted a family. So he got married. And he loves his children. He\u2122s a very good father, and he\u2122s very good to me, unbelievable good to me. And nobody can understand it."

She cannot, she cannot understand it that somebody can l ove two people different way. And the psychiatrist explained it to me. She would never understand it, because sh e never got along with her mother. She loved her father, and the minute her father died, she le ft home. So, she would never understand it. So, I said to him, \ufb01So I am here, why I am here? Y ou won\u2122t understand me either.\ufb02 It was an Italian guy. I said, \ufb01You wouldn\u2122t understand me. What is it to be in the world alone? Two of us, nobody, no family, just two of us. Would you understand that?\ufb02 So he says, \ufb01I didn\u2122t know that, she didn\u2122t tell that.\ufb02 The trouble was, I walked in, he said\u2013 walked in.

And he says, \ufb01How many times your son called you when you were in New York?\ufb02 I says, \ufb01That\u2122s the complaint?\ufb02 I says, \ufb01If you are a good son\u2013\ufb02 You. That\u2122s how I talked to him, \ufb01and your father would die, and your mother is alone in the world, you wouldn\u2122t call her every night?

And sometimes saying, and it was something, no, between us and Ilona, which I thank God, Ilona\u2013 he always told me, \ufb01You can always count on Ilona.\ufb02 He loved Ilona. Jacob was very little. He loved Jaco b, but Ilona was six\u2013 \u201a82 and she was born \u212276, six years old. So Ilona was already a bigger girl.

I says, \ufb01Frank, please don\u2122t talk about that.\ufb02 He says, \ufb01I know I am going to die when I am 6 9.\ufb02 I says, \ufb01What are you talking about?\ufb02 He says, \ufb01Because my uncle came home from hunting, he was fine, too.

            "question": "Okay, tape number five, side A of an interview with Emilie Szekely. And you told on the other tape about your\u2013 how you got out of Hungary. And then you went to Vienna? Can you talk about what you did in Vienna?",
            "answer": "You know how we got out from Hungary? Th at you know? Okay. In Vienna I worked for International Rescue Committee. Their office was in New York, and it was there a boarding school in the Vienna woods. A Hungarian teacher was in Vi enna from New York, who came there, he had his mother and sister in Hungary, a nd he wanted to help them to come over. And his idea was to make a boarding school for th e Hungarian refugee children. Those were all peasants\u2122 children. The parents got\u2013 is it on the ta pe once already? N o. The peasants who came over and they got a contract in Sant o Domingo, I don\u2122t know how many hundreds, that they get land there and they can work there and they get everything. Food and everything. And somehow, somehow, they couldn\u2122t get in t ouch with nobody, but somehow the International Rescue Committee find out that they didn\u2122t get noth ing. They put them on the fields and they didn\u2122t give them nothing. So they managed to bring them back. So, they brought them back to Vienna and the parents, they put to the two camps. And the children, for the children, who were young, school kids, young, elementary school kids, a nd there were some bigger ones, they made that boarding school. It was a beautiful, beautiful place and it was like a palace in the woods. And he talked them into it, that he will be h ead of the school. And b ecause they helped them anyway, the International Rescue Committee. This way they can go to school. So we had seven Hungarian teachers there. And the young ones had school there. And the older ones he took to the village, the first time I saw the\u2013 the Volksw agen bus. He had a Volkswagen bus. He took them by bus to German schools. And they were looking for a person for the office, one person does everything. And my\u2013 Ilona\u2122s sister-in-law, who was already in Vienna\u0160she\u2122s Ilona, too, both of them\u0160she spoke and was always corresponding, that\u2122s what she did, in German, French, English, Hungarian. And she worked for his very, very\u2013 her very, very, very, very rich cousin, who\u2013 he was so rich that he lived in an apartment in the middle of Vienna with his wife and two children near the opera house where Franz Jo sef, Franz Josef\u2122s girl friend lived. And unbelievable, unbelievable, the whole first floor with the same furniture. And he was in a business that time that started, I don\u2122t know what ki nd of electronics they started to make. And he was a big businessman. He was in Hungary, too, but in time he went to Vienna. And he worked in his office, she worked in his office. And she didn\u2122t get enough, she thought that she didn\u2122t get enough pay, then she went to American Embassy, asked for a job. Because she has those, wonderful, wonderful really, she was wonderful typist, too. And they recommended her to that job for International Rescue Committee. Because the International Rescue Committee was in connection with the\u2013 they were connected to the embassy, American Embassy. And she got that job. And when she said it to the cousin that she\u2122s leaving b ecause she can get more money, the cousin said, \ufb01I give you the same mone y.\ufb02 So then she wanted to stay, because she didn\u2122t have to travel. I had to travel by bus out of Vienna and then from the bus I had to walk in the woods. And in the winter it was terrible, big snow and I had to walk to work. But anyway. So, she said, \ufb01Look, go there and tell him that you ar e my relative, and I have to give two weeks notice. I cannot leave right away, I have to give note and I can fill it in for her.\ufb02 So right away he says, \ufb01Okay.\ufb02 He gives me a petty cash box w ith money. That was so funny because I wasn\u2122t used to that kind of a thing. And he told me what is the job, that I have to do the payroll. I have 56 to pay the people. I have to, I don\u2122t know. I had to do the bookkeeping, but I never did. I took it home for my husband, because that was his job. I hated bookkeep ing. And I never knew how to do it, but he graduated business school. He was a wonderful bookkeeper, so he did the bookkeeping. He didn\u2122t know. But when it came\u2013 he didn\u2122t know that I am taking it home. But when it came that I had to go with the Ge rman\u2013 not accountant, who was he? Gosh\u2013 he was an accountant, yes he was an accountant. And I had to give, where, what office, somewhere I had to go at the end of the year. Because it\u2122s the same thing, taxes. He says, \ufb01What about?\ufb02 I couldn\u2122t answer and I told him, \ufb01I am not doing it, my husband is doing it .\ufb02 [Laughing] I told him. He didn\u2122t care about it. But anyway tw o weeks later when it was two weeks, he says, \ufb01Where is Mrs. Schwartz?\ufb02 Her name\u2013 I says, \ufb01S he decided to stay. If you want to keep me, okay. If not, thank you that you kept me.\ufb02 She sa ys, \ufb01Yes, I want to keep you.\ufb02 That\u2122s how I got the job and they paid me in American mone y. I got the\u2013 oh, the Germans didn\u2122t want me. They didn\u2122t want to give me the\u2013 you had to have a certification that you can work there. I was no citizen. And they wanted the job. So in the kitchen it was a German woman, who was the everything, you know, she was overlooking and buying and everything. She was a German woman, but I was in the office. And then he got it. He got in touch with the Embassy and whatever and I got it. I still have it, the okay that I can work. And I got paid in American money. It was\u2013 I don\u2122t know, to me it seemed very much, becau se it was\u2013 I don\u2122t remember how much I got. But we didn\u2122t live in a camp, we didn\u2122t. We lived in an apartment, we lived together with Ilona and her husband. We had toge ther an apartment. And George went to school and she took care of George. And she took back and forth him to school. And then in summer, George came with me there, when it was summe r vacation. And they brought out there\u2013 they did everything for those kids. Unbelievable. And they brought a German artist there to teach them art in the summer. And George was, my George was in the group. And the first time he painted a head on a piece of wood. A piece of wood what was cut out from a tree. And he painted it, oil painting. And the guy came to me and he says, \ufb01Do you know whom you have here?\ufb02 I says, \ufb01What do you mean?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01H e\u2122ll be a great artist.\ufb02 Can you imagine that? And then in New York, too, in elementary\u2013 he ca me to middle school. He didn\u2122t lose nothing. He was in middle school, and there too the teacher came to the house. And he said, \ufb01Do you know\u2013\ufb02 the same words. I said, \ufb01What are you talking about?\ufb02 He sa ys, \ufb01You must come to the principal with me.\ufb02 I went to the principal, and they showed me his work, what is he doing. So, he wanted him to go to an art school in Ma nhattan, a high school. I don\u2122t know what was the name of it. And we misunderstood it. We t hought it was music and ar t high school. And we took him to music and art high school. And it was, oh God, he was traveling on the subways, and that was, you know, it was so far away. Were you in New York? Yeah? It was near the City University, behind City University, behind Columbia University. And he was traveling for four years, because he had a portfolio and they took him. So he went already to music and art high school. And he was really good. And after that he went to Cooper Union, where they take only 50 kids from 500, he was amongst them. And Cooper Union is free, you know, that\u2122s a Foundation. And we just had to pay for the material s, but we didn\u2122t have to pay for his college. 50 took, about 50 from 500 applicants. He was amongst them. So we finished that. He never wanted to go out-of-town college. He was accep ted to Penn State University, and I don\u2122t know where else he applied in case he cannot get to Cooper. But he never wanted to leave us. He said, \ufb01We didn\u2122t come to America to be separated.\ufb02 We were three of us, that\u2122s it. My uncle was still alive, but we were three of us. 57"

            "answer": "Okay, that we didn\u2122t know. It was a quota was over. Closed. They let in so many people everywhere, that it was no open quota. That\u2122s why we had to stay in Vienna. And we stayed 17 months. After 17 months they give for 1,000 pe ople, and we were amongst the first ones because the International Rescue Committee took us . I had my uncle and he sent an affidavit, but we didn\u2122t need it because they paid for us and they took us, the International Rescue Committee. And we were the very first ones. Th e interesting thing was th at by that time, maybe half a year before, we had a Baroness, a real Baroness Reitzes (ph) was her name, working as a\u2013 over the housekeeping. She didn\u2122t do nothing actually. She lived in the middle of Vienna and she had a beautiful apartment, because we we re there. She invited us. And she had a car, she came every, she wanted a job. Her husband wa s Jewish, and he was killed somewhere in labor camp. And she lived alone. She was a fa t woman. And she had\u2013 he r mother lived here, in New York. But she stayed in Vienna and she lived a big life. She had a big dog, I remember. And she had a housekeeper, but she wanted a job. She wanted a job. And she had a car and when she came, she picked me up every day by ca r and took me home by car, so it was much easier on me. But the interesting thing was that I ne ver told her that I was in concentration camp. I never told her. I somehow, I don\u2122t know, th ey didn\u2122t see the number and\u2013 I don\u2122t know. I never say, never told even that I was Jewish, to her. He knew probably, he knew, of course he knew. Haber was his name. He was a school teac her in New York. That was his idea. And I don\u2122t know what happened to him, and to the school , too. Of course it\u2122s not there anymore. Habdersdorf (ph) was the name of the village. And she, when we got the okay to come, we had to go to Salzburg, to the Embassy. There was the American Embassy was in Salzburg, yes. And so she took us by car, three of us, to Salzburg. It was a beautiful, beautiful road. Unbelievable scenery. And then when we parted, I told her that I am Jewish. [Laughing.] She knew that I was in concentration camp. She didn\u2122t know up to that point and she was very upset that I didn\u2122t tell her before that I was in concentration camp. I never told anybody."

When we first, it was May when we got there and beautiful and we had\u2013 already it was arranged for us an apartment when we came. My uncle\u2122s brother arranged. And he was a Jewish man, who was saved in Singapore. He went with his son to Singapore. A very interesting man and he lived alone, an elderly man. And he had a pretty nice big apartment. And he had only one room for himself, and he gave two rooms and the kitchen to us. And so we were there and the windows were open. And when I got up in the morning and I heard the German language under th e window, I got so crazy. I went crazy. My husband couldn\u2122t get a job. He didn\u2122t speak German. He couldn\u2122t get a job, but they gave him some kind of a\u2013 oh, no. When we left I got a letter from the International Rescue Committee that when we arrive we should go to New York, to their main office and show them the letter that I work for them. And we got a couns elor there, and we went in and I give him the letter. I didn\u2122t say nowhere, it doesn\u2122t say nowhere that story? I gave him the le tter, and he looks at me and says, \ufb01I don\u2122t believe it that you don\u2122t remember me.\ufb02 I says, \ufb01I\u2122m so sorry, how do you know me?\ufb02 She says, \ufb01I was in the school there. They came some, observe the school from New York, the International Rescue Committee. Don\u2122t you remember I was there with my wife and I was in one car with you going back to Vienna?\ufb02 Then I remembered. I didn\u2122t even think about it, you know, that is somebody. So, he was very nice. He said, \ufb01You don\u2122t have to show me the letter, I know what you did there, but I must tell you, you did there everything. But in America you have to do one thing, and good, not so many th ings what you did there in the office. I\u2122m going to send you to NCR school.\ufb02 When I heard bookkeeping, I just didn\u2122t\u2013 you know? I didn\u2122t say no, but I didn\u2122t go, when he told me to go to. What happened, I didn\u2122t know that, I got pregnant. And I know it\u2122s that I got pregnant in Salzburg. I rememb er it, but I didn\u2122t know that I got pregnant. I didn\u2122t know. I had my period every month and I didn\u2122t know that I\u2122m pregnant. And three months later I started to bleed like terribly and I didn\u2122t know that I\u2122m pregnant. And I went to the doctor and he said you are pregnant, but you are going to have a miscarriage, because you have fibroids. So, I didn\u2122t go to International School. And he called me on the phone and he called me when I came back from the hospital. And I says, \ufb01I was sick, and that\u2122s what happened. I had a miscarriage,\ufb02 I told him. \ufb01A nd I couldn\u2122t go.\ufb02 But when I was better, they kept me, I was in the fourth month, and they ke pt me there five days. They thought every day the babies, four months. I was dying there. I lo st so much blood. But then finally they did it. And they said that \ufb01You have to come back in six weeks and you have to have a hysterectomy.\ufb02 And six weeks later I went back and they said, \ufb01No you don\u2122t need it. It was so big, everything because you were pregnant. You don\u2122t need a hyst erectomy.\ufb02 So then I went back. When he called me, I said, \ufb01No, I can\u2122t go now.\ufb02 So he sent me to NCR school. NCR was not the cashier machines, they were NCR machines, the cashier, you know. They had big, big bookkeeping machines, before the computers. Big bars, re changeable that you could do everything. You could go, big papers with monthly statements a nd you could go checks. Other side I could put the vendor\u2122s card and put down to whom I am payi ng. And I went there and I learned it in one week. Oh, he asked whether I can type, I says, \ufb01Yes, I can type.\ufb02 So they taught me for the machine in one week and they gave me a job afte r one week. I didn\u2122t have any experience, but I knew how to do the machine. And they gave me a job in a publishing company in Manhattan, Columbus Square or Circle or wh at was it. And I had to travel from Brooklyn. I was so sick on the subways that I was more in the doctor\u2122s office than at home. It was terrible. I cannot, even in Hungary what is above the ground I was always standing outside on the air. I couldn\u2122t travel. And that was underground and was going on in New York subways. It was terrible. And that was a publisher, who made some kind of a\u2013 I don\u2122t know whether it was comic books or what it 59 was, I have no\u2013 Publishing company. And they were two machines, it was a receivable and a payable. And I was the payable and the other guy, a guy, a young guy, who was very helpful. And he tried to teach me, because I knew the ma chine, but I didn\u2122t have experience. I didn\u2122t have the speed, first of all, and if I made a mist ake, I didn\u2122t know how to correct it. And he was very, very helpful. But the comptroller\u2013 not co mptroller, liked me very much, the comptroller, but the bookkeeper, who was from Massachusetts, I didn\u2122t know from my life. I didn\u2122t know where is Massachusetts [laughing], and he was so proud of it, that he is from Massachusetts. He was a misery. And he was a Jew. And he made my life, he got back the checks from the bank, what I was typing. And he found mistakes. He wa s so miserable and he said to me, \ufb01You just came. You are a refugee, and you right away have to sit in an office?\ufb02 Can you imagine? A Jew. I was very miserable. It was 60 dollars a week, what was a nice pay at that time. And they gave me even commissions. I don\u2122t know what wa s it, from sale or something. I was there for three months and I was constantly looking for a nother job. And one day from New York Times, I see a job, Brooklyn Jewish Hospital is looking for an NCR operator. They were on strike because they were already\u2013 the half, not the office, but the kitchen and the\u2013 I don\u2122t know, cleaning people, they were in the Union. And they had a strike. The office, too, because nobody could, they had a black man working years on that machine, and he left because he got a better job under the strike. And they didn\u2122t have no one for three months. They had young girls, but they left. Young people don\u2122t want to sit and work. You had to sit at the machine. So, when I saw that, it was in walking distance from us, th e hospital, and I had to pass by, every morning, my uncle\u2122s pharmacy. So he came always earlier to open that he should see me in the morning when I go to work or when I go home, because it was in a walking distance. And I never thought that I stay there. And the comptroller wasn\u2122t\u2013 was out of town or I don\u2122t know where. He wasn\u2122t there when I got the job. So the personnel, she gave me the job. And I was working, it was a big office and we had two machines like there, accounts payable and receivable. The receivable was another woman working. And the co mptroller came back and he called me to the office and he greeted me and he was very, very nice to me. And he said, \ufb01I must tell you one thing, if you do the job by Christmas\u2013\ufb02 they we re behind three months with bills. Well I saw those bins with bills. \ufb01If you do it by Christmas, the job is yours.\ufb02 So I started to do it and I started to be very fast on the machine, very fa st. And I did it day before Christmas. So, but women there, they were Jewish women, they were ve ry jealous. One of them, first of all I never spoke about concentration camp. Never. It was mixed, they were non-Jews and Jews there, and I never spoke to them about it. And one woma n, a Jewish woman, she said to me, \ufb01Why did you come to America?\ufb02 This way. I says, \ufb01What do you mean?\ufb02 He says, \ufb01Why, the communism is not enough good?\ufb02 I says, \ufb01Maybe it is good for you because you have a house, every child of you has a car and you have a nice job. You could change place with me,\ufb02 I said. [Laughing] Can you imagine that? She was a Leftist. And sh e didn\u2122t work on a machine, but she worked in the office. That time it was everything togeth er, the billing. We had a big, big office and machine and no machine. The machines were in the back. And then there was another woman, who was like that man there, who was controlling me and she was miserable, too. If I made a mistake, she was miserable. And I was crying, a nd I went to the Comptroller and I says, \ufb01I just don\u2122t know what to do.\ufb02 She says, \ufb01What\u2122s happening?\ufb02 And I told him what\u2122s happening. He says, \ufb01You come to me, you don\u2122t go to them. If you don\u2122t know something you come to me.\ufb02 It was a man. And from then on, I was all right. I had trouble because I had to answer the telephone. I was payable and the vendors were calling me. So, in the beginning I had big trouble. I spoke English, but I spoke English, not Yankee. Because I learned English from an 60 English teacher in Czechoslovakia when it was H ungary already and we thought that we come to America. We had private lessons . And my sister was very, very smart. And we were reading Anna Karenina in English and\u2013 I told you, no? That story. So we learned English. And we didn\u2122t understand each other on the phone, you know? [Laughing.] So in the beginning I had problems, but then it was okay. Even the Amer icans came to me, how do you spell that, how do you spell this? You know? That was the end. But I never thought that I stay there 27 years. I stayed there 27 years. I went through many comptrollers. [La ughing.] He left, but he was a long time there. But he left. And then one da y the Personnel Director comes in, closes the door and he says, \ufb01Attention, please.\ufb02 Everybody looks up, \ufb01What is it?\ufb02 He says, \ufb01I must announce it, that from yesterday on, ev erybody is in the Union.\ufb02 So I didn\u2122t know what does it mean and why is it good or bad, just in the Union. Fine. I don\u2122t care where we are. And it was an unbelievable advantage. I was the highest paid because of the machines. So, if somebody got three dollars pay and raise, I got five dollars raise. From 60 dollars in one year, because I started with 60 back there in the other place, I went up to 125 dollars because of the Union. And thank God, because of the Union, I have a pension today from the Union, and I have free medication. My medication bills are 4,000 dollars a year, be cause they are sending me the company\u2122s and that\u2122s another pension, 4,000 dollars. And I am getting pension. And because\u2013 oh, that\u2122s the story. Before I\u2013 a year before I left, it was an other strike. And I didn\u2122t go to work, because I was afraid. You know? Crossing th e picket lines. But I never picketed, never. I was in the country for a month, it was a month strike. And I was in touch with them. I called always Personnel. Personnel was begging me, \ufb01Please come back.\ufb02 Because by that time we had only one machine, it was no more receivable because th ey gave it out to computers. So, I was the only machine and the only person who knew the m achine. They were typing checks, the people who were non-Union. And it was horrible, horrible, they were behind, and terrible. And he was begging me, \ufb01Please come back. Come back, don\u2122t worry, nobody is picketing anymore.\ufb02 And they were in the country and one day he calls me and he says, \ufb01Come back. We are going to send you a Black girl down for you if you are afraid. We are watching you when you when you are coming. And please come back.\ufb02 And they went to the country and they dropped me off and they are watching it whether I go in. It was no picketing. It was no picket line anymore. And I went in and then everybody was shocked, becau se nobody knew that I am not in the Union. I couldn\u2122t have, I couldn\u2122t, I don\u2122t know. It was\u2013 they just didn\u2122t believe it that I am, you know, in the Union, in the Union, the people. Because that was a job what was a confidential job, with the payroll and everything. So they didn\u2122t believe it that I am in the Union. So, what happened, the person\u2013 End of Tape 5, Side A 61 Tape 5, Side B ",
                " \u2013you get out from the Union. They didn\u2122t know that I am close to retirement. That I wanted to retire. I didn\u2122t know either. If you get out from a union and you get the hospital pension and you get medication from the hospital, doctors from the hospital and they give you 25,000 a year. I said, \ufb01How do I do that?\ufb02 He says, \ufb01I\u2122m goi ng to send a telegram,\ufb02 because the Union was threatening us, that if we are still on strike th ey are not going to cover us medically. Because they had very good medical coverage. Every doc tor wanted you if you were in the Union. I says, \ufb01I cannot live without medical coverage.\ufb02 She says, \ufb01Okay so I\u2122m going to tell them that you cannot be without coverage and you are out from the Union.\ufb02 So, for one year, I went out from the Union. Then after a year , I wanted to retire. I worked one year more than 65, 66 I was when I left. And I says, \ufb01Can you put me back to the Union?\ufb02 Because they would have to give me a pension from the hospital if I am not in the Union. So the personnel, the secretary, his secretary, arranged it that they paid me for one year dues, for one year everything, because they paid for medical for us, the Union. And they paid for pension. I paid the bills, hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Union. I was paying them. And they said that it was a mistake and they got me back to the Union. Can you imagine? It was such a luck because I wouldn\u2122t have the Union. I wouldn\u2122t have the pension because they say to me\u2013 I\u2122m talking to some people from the hospital, \ufb01It\u2122s terrible, it\u2122s almost ba nkrupt.\ufb02 We were bankrupt after ten years, we went to Chapter 11. I went to, through with th em, voided thousands and thousands of checks and everything after ten years. And they had to merg e with another hospital. It was St. Joseph\u2013 St. John\u2122s. Here is St. Joseph\u2122s. St. John\u2122s Hospital. And then we got more, we were the main hospital. We got more employees. It was 3,000 pe ople. And we paid everything. We paid they bills, too, for medication, for the pharmacy tech, ev erything. It was everything through us. So it was a very big job. But I had a separate room because the machine was very noisy. And I was alone in the room, so that was very good. And they always wanted me to be a manager and I didn\u2122t want to because I knew that I am out of the Union if I am a manager. I says, \ufb01I do the job. I am not a manager.\ufb02 So, I was lucky. "

They didn\u2122t let me go through because they said that I have something on my lungs. It turned out that I had pneumonia in the camp and I didn\u2122t know about it and it showed. And they said, \ufb01They can go, your husband and your son, but you have to go on another plane, because it\u2122s something.\ufb02 I went crazy. They didn\u2122t want to go without me, but luckily they called me for a second x-ray and that was all well. That was okay, so we came together. But we came on a military plane. I don\u2122t know how many hundreds of people, and so uncom fortable, and we were sitting in the last row, near the toilet. And they were only two seats, so we always changed. One sits with George and then the other one was sitting alone, you know? But we were sitting in the same row, but between us the aisle. Very uncomfortable, very. I think we were 24 hours in the air. It was just terrible. And we stopped at Newfoundland, Newfoundland. And then they gi ve us there the first 62 meal, a dinner. And from that I got so sick, that the whole journey to New York, it was just unbelievable. I was so sick. But I was pregnant and I didn\u2122t know, maybe that\u2122s why I was sick from the food. So when we arrived, it was th at time Kennedy Airport\u2013 no, La Guardia, I\u2122m sorry. La Guardia, not Kennedy Airport. And we saw my uncle and my aunt up there waiting for us and waving. And we saw the first Black man in our lives. They had a postman, who delivered the mail and he had a car. And my uncle, he came always\u2013 he had like here in pharmacies they have a counter where you have food, too. It was so strange to me, because there is no such a thing in Europe in pharmacies. Phar macy is pharmacy. And he was telling him that if he has a free day, that he is going to pay him ta ke him to the airport and wait for us. So he was a fat man and it was the first time in my life th at I saw a black man. And he was taking us home to my uncle. They lived not very far from the pharmacy. Though the house was theirs, the pharmacy was one day apartments. They lived in a separate apartment. And he had a partner because his diploma\u2013 I have still his Russian diploma, was not certificated, so he had an American partner. Very nice people. They lived in the house, in the upstairs in the house. They were very good friends. They didn\u2122t have children, and they didn\u2122t have children. They were very good friends. He was a very nice man. And so we were three days in our uncle\u2122s house. It was only, what they had, the living room is a bi g, big. Bedroom they had, and a living room, a kitchen. It was a private, private house. I don\u2122t know, bathroom, nothing el se. They had two in the house, two apartments in the ho use, the landlord and them. And they rented for us, in that kind of a house, but in another street, an apartment, upstairs. But it was small. It was just a bedroom and a little living room and at the e nd of the living room was the kitchen, a small kitchen with a small frigidaire. So, that was our first apartment. And that was our street where George went to middle school."

I love the ocean in th e Spring and in the Fall. I don\u2122t like to go in because the mob was there, it\u2122s unbelievable. But to walk on the Boardwalk, the sundown, the sunset, it was so relaxing. It was wonderful. And they were benches, you know, and we were sitting on it. It was unbelievable, and I missed it here very, very much when I came here. When I came here I knew Lexington, because he\u2122s here for \u201a79, 1979. And three times a year I was here. I had four weeks vacation, three weeks he re and one week in the country house, that country house in the Catskills. My husband loved it because he loved the country. He loved it. He loved it here. When he saw the horses, and we wanted to retire here. We came here and always looking for places where\u2013 we wanted a duplex. We always thought it\u2122s enough, we are together and separate. But for them it was ne ver enough, the duplex. For us it would be, they are small apartments. But anyway it didn\u2122t come to it, because he died. But he wanted to live here. I loved the big cities. I never lived in a small town, because where we lived in Czechoslovakia, that was the capital of that part. And Budapest is beautiful. So I couldn\u2122t 63 imagine to live\u2013 and they was always questioning where is the city here? Where is the city? [Laughing]"

Every year they spent there and I went with them. It\u2122s half of mine, from the summer house. My husband bought it for me and them, half. But we paid th eir half with cash because they didn\u2122t have money at that time, they just started teaching and th ey gave us the credit. So we paid they half cash and they paid the other half out in ten years. And it\u2122s in the Catskills. It\u2122s a beautiful place. It\u2122s a small house, but it was very nice. We have two bedrooms and in between us was the bathroom and the living room a nd upstairs it was a big, big attic and it was made up for a bedroom, but we didn\u2122t need it. Because we were four only. They didn\u2122t have even children at that time, \u201a73. And even in the winter we went up. It was beautiful. It was very close to all the skiing place, all the people. It\u2122s very nice. And he wouldn\u2122t sell it, because he\u2122s very sentimental, because Daddy loved it. He would neve r sell it, and he loves it because he is away from here and he is going up four or five, it\u2122s three acres, hill. And underneath there is a big, big library, that\u2122s our neighbor. It\u2122s a library for four, five towns, five little towns. A big library. And\u2013"

They have it, but I don\u2122t like those people because they\u2013 I don\u2122t like them because they went away from the synagogue and they have their own congregation, the Havarah. And I cannot see that. And in the beginning, when George moved here, they were so friendly to him. They wanted to get him there. And he would never go. Because they have here a rabbi, who was blind. He was a very nice man. He died from diabetes, fairly young. And he\u2013 I don\u2122t like those people, because when they found out that George doesn\u2122t want to belong there, it was finished with the friendship. You know? But when they come some times to the synagogue or whatever, they are nice to you. You know? But they have their own clique, only Havarah, but they are none of them from Lexington. They are everybody from some wheres else. And they feel that they are together and they help each other. And it\u2122s a bigger, there are 80 families now there. They are always bigger and bigger. They don\u2122t have a place where to pray. They pray, I think, once a month or twice a month, I don\u2122t know and always someplace else. In the Christian church basement or someplace. They don\u2122t have a steady place. Sometimes they pray here, too. Pray here in the club. But I really don\u2122t have no friends.

But we had private buses and th ey went certain hours, because I didn\u2122t want to go by train. And I didn\u2122t drive to Manhattan. She was going to the same beauty parlor as me and she was sitting near me. And one day I hear that she\u2122s talking about it that she was in Alaska and whatever, but still I didn\u2122t talk to her. Maybe I am not frie ndly. I am not talking to people whom I don\u2122t know, but I overhea rd everything. But she noticed\u2013 yeah, I go to the bus and I am waiting on the bus.

My husband died.\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01Where do I leave the ticket?\ufb02 She said, leave it with my beautician when you go the beauty parlor. And I left the ticket, and from then on we became good friends. And every week we went together, but not by bus. I was driving. I know how to drive, but she didn\u2122t have a car. She knew where to go, but I knew how. And we went by car. And there was the parking under the theater and it paid. Because it was $3.50 a trip, you know, it\u2122 s seven dollars, fourteen from ten dollars, parking under the theater. And after that we went always to Marriott Hotel, up, they had a wonderful, wonderful, like Viennese Bakery, a garden restaurant, where they had coffee and cake. After that we went up, and we were very good friends, but it was only six months because six months later I came. And her son was a ma nager of the Days Inn Hotel in Manhattan. And when we went, first time when we went to the co untry, first year, and I was very, very homesick for New York and I was depressed and I was cr ying in the country. And George said, \ufb01Do you want to go to the city?\ufb02 I says \ufb01Yes.\ufb02 So, I called her up and her son gave us a suite for 25 66 dollars and we stayed there for th ree days. And he went to the museum right away. And I went, I think, with Laura to Fifth Avenue. I don\u2122t know. And I think that Ilona went with him, yes, to the museum. And we stayed there three days. A nd then again, one time I went only with Ilona. I stayed there a week. And I included her always, the woman for th e theater, and they gave us a dinner there, for the\u2013 I remember before we le ft and she was there too, you know, in the hotel. And we had a very good time, but it was only for six months. I met her late. I mean I saw her, but I didn\u2122t know who she was and because I was th ere four years alone. And she was alone four years, too. And she was retiring, too, the same time. She worked 20, 27 years, too. Can you imagine that? So it was late."

That was another high school, but that was regular high school. I don\u2122t know what was the name, in Nicholasville, Jessamine County. And they were, it was a man teacher, who was very, very nice. He was a hi story teacher. But it was a\u2013 they sat like around the wall in circle they put the chairs. And on that side, on the left side, it was a circle with about ten boys, who were shaved, their heads and they didn\u2122t look at me. Because at that time I was beginner speaker and I started to speak and I asked them who believes in the Holocaust, that the Holocaust is true, they should put their hands up. They didn\u2122t. And the whole time I was talking and they didn\u2122t look at me. So when I finished, and I was pretty nervous, that was my first speech. But it was good because the teacher was absolutely wonderful.

And I says, \ufb01And do you know whom you have here?\ufb02 He says, \ufb01Unfortunately, yes.\ufb02 So, that was a bad experience for me, you know , that there are skinheads there. It was in Nicholasville. But then I spoke many, many tim es in Nicholasville middle school, and when Laura was teaching, that was mi ddle school. And that high school. I don\u2122t know what was the name of that high school. They were all girls, women, I mean, and one of them came to me. 69 They came after me and she said that, \ufb01I thank you very much for coming because my father is German and he is telling an entirely different story and I knew that it\u2122s something wrong how he is telling it to us.\ufb02 So I had that kind of an experiences. Then it was non-stop, one school after the other. Then it was in Paris, Kentucky. In Paris, Kentucky it was a professor in education. That was George\u2122s department, education, I mean he was in Art and Education, two appointments. A very nice, very nice professor. And he had student teachers in Paris, Kentucky, and he took me to Paris, Kentucky. And some, th ey took videos there that day, but it was a very big wind and the windows were open. They didn\u2122t have air conditioners. And the videos didn\u2122t came out. Well, so he took me the second time a nd he took with him a pr ofessional videotaper from U.K. And I didn\u2122t know nothing, who else is there, but I saw that they are women there and they are taking pictures, too, from me. And they are writing. I had no idea that the paper is there. He called The Herald. And that was the first time when I was in The Herald-Leader. And when I was in The Herald Leader, it was no stop. People were calling me. Schools were calling me, and I can tell you that I spoke in every sc hool in Lexington, not once, because I spoke 160 times already. Because usually I, they put t ogether six, seven, eight grades usually in the auditorium. And if the next bunch of kids comes, they call me back again. And in every high school I spoke, too. In every high school. I spoke twice in Dunbar. In\u2013 what is that station? Bryan Station, Bryan Station, they were very nice there. I spoke in Lafayette. Now I have to go again. Because I spoke when Ilona was there and still the teacher is there and now Anna has the teacher. And she, he was asking whether your grandmother still does it. And Henry Clay, I spoke at Henry Clay. Twice I s poke already at the Community Coll ege. Three times at U.K. I spoke in the nurse\u2122s department, Psychiatric Nu rses\u2122 department.

And what they do, the Scapa\u2013 oh, I spoke, lately I spoke in the Adult Educati on at night. That\u2122s education at U.K. I have a series for the concerts, five tickets for the U.K\u2013 not U.K., concerts what they are doing, gosh, five a year. Five concerts, from all over the world they are coming. And the teacher, the professor that sits in front of me, sh e is a woman, but is George\u2122s colleague actually. So, she never\u2013 I don\u2122t know, she was always afraid to ask me and we always talk to her. And a few weeks ago, it was a concert and she turns around and she says, \ufb01Are you alright?\ufb02 And I says, \ufb01Yes, why?\ufb02 I wasn\u2122t all right the week before and George was there with Ana. And she says, \ufb01Oh, can I ask you to talk?\ufb02 I says, \ufb01Of course.\ufb02 And one of her students, they are all for Masters, teachers who are going for Masters. And one of her students is from Scapa. And she\u2122s her best friend. And that woman, she is a pastor\u2122s wife from the Lutheran church, Mrs. Gross. Wonderful, wonderful person. I don\u2122t know how many times I spoke. And what she is doing, she binds the books what the children are writing. The letters, and it\u2122s unbelievable what they are doing. And flowers they are giving me. And that professor, Dr. Backner, I don\u2122t know how many times he took me. He was, unfortunately he didn\u2122t get tenure at U.K. because he wasn\u2122t writing. But he said he didn\u2122t want the tenure. He was there six years. And then he was principal in Georgetown. And he called me there, too. I spoke in Georgetown for him, and he picks me up, and he takes me home, and in-between he takes me to a restaurant when he takes 70 me home, to the nicest restaura nts to eat. And it was an opening here in Lexington, what\u2122s it, Lexington Traditional. It\u2122s on Nicholasville Roa d. And I asked him when he was in\u2013 because I spoke there two or three times and I knew it was an opening there for principal. And I ask him in Georgetown whether he wants to come to Lexi ngton. He lives here. And he says, \ufb01Why?\ufb02 I says, \ufb01Because I know it\u2122s, I don\u2122t know the principal who is there, just in between.\ufb02 He lives, she was, he was Laura\u2122s principal in Jesse Clark. He lives in our corner. And I said, \ufb01Is Mr. Mossgrave there?\ufb02 And he says, \ufb01Oh, not a bad idea.\ufb02 And then I spoke to Mossgrave. I says, \ufb01Would you please call him because you are here onl y for a few months.\ufb02 [Laughing] Because he is retired, and he works a few months only be cause of the Social Security probably. And he got the job. He got the job. So I already spoke twice to him here, in _______. And last time his wife picked me up, and we me t in the restaurant, Chaise (ph) . And he came there from school and his daughter came, too. It\u2122s very interesting. His daughter was for a whole year in Belarus. Very interesting. She said, she loves the people there and she wants to learn the language. Very nice person. And both of them ca me to listen to me, too. The wife and the daughter, last time that I spoke. It was the end of the year."

Memories are always with me, not coming up, they are always with me. And I don\u2122t try to forget it. Sylvia trie s to forget it. That\u2122s the difference between me and Sylvia. And it\u2122s a big difference, because she married an American man and she never had to talk about it. So it\u2122s a big difference. But she doesn\u2122t want to talk about it with me either. And she was in the same place. She was in Berg en-Belsen. And she doesn\u2122t want, she says what she has left over, life, she wants to make it happy. I cannot forget it. I cannot erase it that they killed my parents. I can\u2122t. And the six m illion people and everybody and big, big family from my grandmother\u2122s side. I can\u2122t. I can\u2122t forg et it, no one day. And I am dreaming about it, especially when I\u2122m talking, I\u2122m dreaming. I said once to my heart doctor, I says, \ufb01I just don\u2122t know, I cannot sleep. Maybe I shouldn\u2122t talk anymore.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Y ou just take your pill and talk.\ufb02 [Laughing] That\u2122s what he said. They are so funny the doctors. They have my pictures, when I am in the newspaper, they put it in they files. So, when they bring the files, here you are. It\u2122s interesting. Yeah, lot of them."

I have to come\u2013 I have to forget that guilt feeling, because I wasn\u2122t there. I wasn\u2122t there. And I am sure that if I would be there, I would do the same thing. Because she had an opportunity to escape and she says, \ufb01I go where my mother goes.\ufb02 And if I would be there, I would do the same thing. I wasn\u2122t there. It was a coincidence. I had problem with my rheumatic fever that year and I had to go\u2013 my mo ther send me first. Every summer we spent there in Budapest at my grandmother\u2122s house. And I took every year a cure for my rheumatic fever. When it was nothing wrong with me. Th e doctor said we should do it that it shouldn\u2122t 71 come back. And I had a doctor there, in one of th ose baths that they have. It\u2122s wonderful waters they have. And he gave me a cure for three weeks. And it wasn\u2122t my fault that I wasn\u2122t there. I was thinking about it many times. That I should make, I shouldn\u2122t be so guilty because it wasn\u2122t my fault. First time in my life, I was 21, and fi rst time in my life I was traveling alone. It was 400 miles on the train to my gra ndmother. Because I finished school and my sister was still in school, otherwise we would go together. The year before, Christmas, we went together with my sister. So it wasn\u2122t my fault. It was fate. It was fate. And when I was telling it in some schools and I says\u2013 children were asking me, how come that you survive? I says, \ufb01That\u2122s the only question I cannot answer you.\ufb02 And the principal, not principal, the Superintendent, I didn\u2122t know that he was there. He said\u2013 he was sitting in the corner. \ufb01I tell you why,\ufb02 he said. \ufb01That she should spread it to the people.\ufb02 I says, \ufb01Thank you very much for helping me out, but I think my sister could have spread it, too.

That they really shouldn\u2122t do it, that they leave me alone here. I went with them every year, but I don\u2122t know how many ye ars now, about four years, I don\u2122t go because Laura wants to be alone with George. And he says we are here together the whole year, we are together. Though it\u2122s my house, I cannot go there. So, I went there three years ago. She went to Hungary with Ana, because she was never in Hungary, Ana. She was never in Hungary. Ilona was with me. I took Ilona. \u212289, after her, that was my Bat Mitzvah present to her in \u201a89. I took her to Hungary for three weeks and one week in Vienna we were. And so, she went with Ana. I gave Ana her Bat Mitzvah present, the ticket, to go to Hungary. So Laura had a free ticket that she\u2122s collecting, you know, the free flights. So they went to Hungary. And then I went for three weeks to the country and stayed with George. I had a great time. I had a great time. What should I tell you. So, that\u2122s the situation. I won\u2122t go there now, sick as I am. See we have always only one car there, and I am depending on them. And it\u2122 s not comfortable anymore. I took now, when the children are there, upstair s the bedroom, because it\u2122s a\u2013 they made a window, you know, the skylight there. And they have air conditioner up there. I cannot go steps up again, and up and down. And they made a half ba throom there, I made. I had to pay half for it, the time that I am up there. And that\u2122s only half bathroom. If I want to take a bath, I have to go downstairs. It\u2122s no more comfortable for me. It came to a point that it\u2122s no more comfortable."

They are laughing wh en I am saying it, that I am afraid from everything. I am afraid of my shadow, you know, that kind of a situation. But no. When we went to Hungary and they were asking us, \ufb01How could you live there? This is a jungle there, in New York.\ufb02 You know? They have a very bad opi nion of what\u2122s happening in New York. It\u2122s happening here, too. This is much smaller and what\u2122s happening here, when you open the television, they start the killing. Okay, it\u2122s a fam ily killing or whatever but it\u2122s happening. It\u2122s happening here, too. And it\u2122s always worse for the people who don\u2122t live in a place. You know, it seems much worse. I don\u2122t know. I wasn\u2122t a fraid in New York where I lived. Once I was very afraid, when I sold my house and I sold it to a Chinese guy, who, they knew that they have to give back Hong Kong, and they were coming. And he said that he wants it for his family. Baloney. He made a business from it. He made from a two-family house, four families. For money, he\u2122s getting rent. Unbelievable. From the basement he made two apartments and two apartments what we had upstairs. I went to see it when\u2013 there\u2122s no garage. From the garage he made an apartment. It\u2122s unbelievable. And he want ed to get out from it, the last minute. But he had 25 thousand dollar, 25 put down? How much ? I don\u2122t know how many thousands he had to put down when we made the agreement. It wa s in the lawyers, collateral, you know. And he wanted to, if he doesn\u2122t get the mortgage what he wants, that he can get out from it, but he got the mortgage what he wanted. The lawyer find out he got the mortgage what he wanted. But he wanted a cheaper mortgage and he wanted to ge t out. But then he would lose that money. I think it was 25. I don\u2122t remember. Anyway. A nd I was getting phone calls and it was a strange, strange accent, that I am going to come and kill you. So then I said, \ufb01My God, I want to get out as early as can from here.\ufb02 You know? I thi nk they were those people, those Chinese, I don\u2122t know. Then I was very afraid. Though in the beginning I was very afraid, we were robbed. So I slept, not in our house, we lived in an apartment and we were one apartment, second apartment, we were robbed. But that\u2122s why we bought the house, we went out from that neighborhood. But otherwise, otherwise I didn\u2122t have that fear. I didn\u2122t go on the subways, I was driving. And it was very dangerous already, in the hospital, too. So it was a parking lot across the street where I paid parking. And I just ran to the building. It was very dangerous. I got out at the last minute really, because if you walked in the hospital it self, in the lobby, and you had a necklace on or something, people from outside came and they took it off. So it was a very dangerous place. And it is very interesting that every hospital in New York, it is in a bad place now. It is very interesting. Even Flowers (ph) , Fifth Avenue, my God, my husband was operated, spine operation and I went to visit him with George. Behind it there were big buildings and we had to get off the subway. And they were throwing bottles against us. That was the best hospital, the name Flower, Fifth Avenue. Can you imagine? Th at was years ago. Stay in Harlem, or no. So, we came here. What I was seeing today on the tele vision show, it\u2122s really scary, about five black guys, who are thieves. And that show is from New York, and how they are stealing cars and how they are just bumping into people\u2122s cars. And then innocent women, they get out, what happened. And they get out too, behind them and they grab their necks, put them in the other car behind them and they take that car because it\u2122s a be tter car than theirs. There were five of them. Can you imagine that? I don\u2122t know how they can say it on the television this way. And there was a detective there, too. And they were saying it, how they are show it how they are doing it and they are selling it. And she said, \ufb01How much you get for that car?\ufb02 She says, \ufb01We sell it for 73 parts, 500 dollars. And if it\u2122s a Mercedes, a nice, new one, sometimes 5,000 dollars.\ufb02 This is, this is, now again a more dangerous life since I ca me. They were stealing cars, of course they were stealing cars, but that way I didn\u2122t hear it, never, when I was living there. So it\u2122s now 13 years."

And she, nobody was her friend, only I. [Laughing.] But she lives here a long, long time, and her mother was Russian. And she was born in Canada. And she\u2122s telling me that this neighborhood, when she\u2013 they builded the house. They didn\u2122t allow Jews in this neighborhood. That was what she was telling me. And then I had a remark.

And she, she was unbelievable, they didn\u2122t want to take her nowhere between them, b ecause she was marrying to a Chinese. He is a genius. He is now 70, I don\u2122t know, something. He got tenure. He was with IBM originally. And then he was teaching at UK. And now he is teaching in Frankfort in state university. And at age 70 they gave him tenure. He is such a genius. But he is Chinese. And she has two Chinese, he has two daughters, a daughter and a son, both of them are doctors. And they were really suffering in this neighborhood, she said, becau se they were Chinese kids. She was always telling me what they went through. So, it\u2122s any differe nce, Chinese or Jew? If they don\u2122t, if it\u2122s not their own, then they don\u2122t like you. I don\u2122t k now. We are friends. With this building now.

And we didn\u2122t go to each other\u2122s houses, but when we spoke we were very nice. And her daughter, Jenna\u2122s daughter, when she got married in Louisville all the neighbors got together, five of us and we went all to the wedding, to her daughter\u2122s wedding, because she didn\u2122t have any family here. She do esn\u2122t have any family here. And because I am Jewish and she is married to a Chinese [laughi ng] so we are very good friends. We are going together, she helps me enormously. She is a very good person. Now she was, she was nurse, actually. She went for nursing in Case Western, in Cleveland. She met him there somewhere, I don\u2122t know, in Ohio. She\u2013 really, she felt it at UK. She was in the Nursing department and she was the head of the private nurses at that time th ey had. And she had to give the patients the nurses. And she is absolutely, you know, she didn\u2122t know about discrimination. And she gave once a black nurse to a white person. She was fi red. And then when she was fired from there she started to tutor. She is very good in ma th. And she tutored all the kids from this neighborhood. She knows everybody because she was a tutor. And from that, because it was not enough what her husband made, they send the two children to medical school . The daughter is a psychiatrist and she is having now the first baby, she is waiting every minute, though she is 35 74 years old. Yeah, she is. And she lives in Louisville . And the son is in Louisville, too. He is a general practitioner, but he wanted to be a surgeon. End of Tape 6, Side A 75 Tape 6, Side B ",
