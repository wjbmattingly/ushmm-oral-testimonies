And for a lot of people, especially Auschwitz survivors, there really weren\u2122t a lot of photos of Auschwitz taken during the war, so it really was proof that \u0152 in-incredible proof that people could point to, it was all over the news. It also started a debate among historians, which you know, and you and I have talked about, and you\u2122ve written about it, about whether or not Auschwitz, the crematoriums and gas chambers at Auschwitz could have been bom bed.

You know, they didn\u2122t have the intelligence or the tools to analyze the photos, to be able to pin out what was the crematorium, and what was the gas chambers and do those sorts of things.

Whatever they had something [indecipherable] they \u0152 we could hit it. And \u0152 and medium bombers, they are much more accurate than the \u0152 than the heavies. And I think it could have been bombed by medium. In fact, I would ha ve volunteered on that type of mission. You could have moved B fif \u0152 B-25s into position and B-25s could have got them, cause it \u0152 now, how long would it take them though to \u0152 to reconstruct? I don\u2122t think you can reconstruct one of those killing stations in say, six weeks. They \u0152 somebody said, well you can \u0152 oh , we can build them in six weeks. But they said, Interview with Dino Brugioni November 13, 2014 77well, the one guy said oh yeah, well, we can \u2122t \u0152 we can\u2122t \u0152 we can\u2122t gas them, but we\u2122ll \u0152 we\u2122ll u \u0152 we\u2122ll kill them with rifles.
