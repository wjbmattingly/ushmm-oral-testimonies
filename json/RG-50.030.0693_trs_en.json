Taylor jumped on the running board of the car, and forced the driver, who was wearing Luftwaffe uniform, to pull up. There were four men in the car, and one who spoke English said he had papers for Field Marshall Montgomery to sign. Taylor then asked a German policeman if the papers were in order and the German replied, yes. Still not satisfied, Taylor took the occupants of the car to Fusilier Miller, the interpreter and Miller immediately had them taken before the c.o. Taylor returned to his post on the bridge and a few minutes later one of the men he had arrested was marched onto the bridge again, and his photograph was taken with the c.o. and adjutant. This man was the notorious Seyss-Inquart. So thanks to the vigilance of one of our battalion\u2019s men, another war criminal was in the bag. Terrific. Let\u2019s put that in there.
