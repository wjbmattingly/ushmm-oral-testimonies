So when we go to W\u00fcrzburg , we got another train, it stopped in Cologne . Wa \u0152 as we were in the station, a group of Kindertransport was going to England . My father asked them if I could travel with them, so they Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 33said okay, if \u0152 if \u0152 if you have pa pers. And it so happened that in Cologne was an English consulate. We go \u0152 he and I, we went there. It was closed. They told me to wait a block away. Somehow he got inside. He got a stamp in my passport. It was the last day of the co \u0152 the consul to be th ere. It\u2122s the last day. So he got in, got a stamp in my passport, with a notation, see letter.
