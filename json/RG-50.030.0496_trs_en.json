And he -- I only recently learned from my sister, my older sister, that he was a baker on the Holland-America line. And apparently before he was married, he -- that\u2019s what he did. And at some point, I don\u2019t exactly know where in -- in the yearly chronology, he decided he wasn\u2019t going to do this any more. And they prevailed on him to do it once more, and do it once more, and I guess he did it, he did -- went one more trip and they said we want you to take one more trip, and I -- I guess he put his foot down and said, I\u2019m not doing it any more. And the -- that voyage, that ship that he said no to apparently was detonated by some torpedo that was left over from World War I. So that whatever it was, fate, whatever, saved him when he decided no, he wasn\u2019t going to do this any more. But that\u2019s what he did. And he had a bakery in Amsterdam, but I was never there, and we had already moved from there when I was born."

Being left at the dinner or breakfast table with my father is an early memory, because I didn\u2019t eat. And they used to say I lived off the air. I just was not a child who ate a lot, and I -- or at all, and so he was the one elected to amuse me and tell me stories. And he would pull out the contents of his pockets and make up stories, and then occasionally try to slide a spoonful of something or other in my mouth. And that -- that\u2019s sort of my earliest recollection, it- it\u2019s one of the very early ones."

I-I don\u2019t know, I actually never asked her. But there was always this little bit of time for us, and it was generally -- I don\u2019t remember if it was after or before supper, but it was either very late in the afternoon, or early evening."

            "answer": "I don\u2019t think he asked me what my day was like. My sort of recollection, and as I say here, I\u2019m not really sure this is a recollection or whether I imagined this, that we talked at a child\u2019s level about something very present. There wasn\u2019t stuff about what did you do, or what are you going to do, but more -- more about do you hear that bird singing, or s-something rooted in the present that a -- a -- rooted in the experience we were having together at that time."

            "num": 31,
            "question": "Was his way of behaving with you, it -- as -- from what you can remember, different from other fathers? It doesn\u2019t sound like the usual story of a father being so concerned about the kids.",
            "answer": "I -- if I say this is unusual, it comes from a -- a long backwards and adult perspective and certainly not a child\u2019s memory because I had no idea what another father might have been like. But I would say yes. I would say for several reasons. Number one, he was an extremely gentle and patient man, which is the reason he took -- took all the stuff out of his pocket forever and ever and ever, and in fact one of those things sort of backfired, because I knew that among the treasures he had in his pocket was a small pair of scissors. And one time he and I were sitting in the living room of our house, and we had very heavy oak, dark, dark oak furniture, sort of dark, dark -- you know that heavy European furniture. And over the big, big table in the middle of this living room -- w-why this living room had this great big table sort of like -- more like a dining room table, I don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s the way it was set up. And the table had these heavy crosspieces underneath. And there was a plush tablecloth, if you can imagine, it\u2019s more the kind of thing you can imagine over a piano, but it was over the table, and it had long fringes on it, and it was over the table in such a way that the points of the cloth were on the ends and so forth. And it was great place for me, I always had my little hideout there, it was a little -- like a little house, and I asked to borrow the scissors one day, and I climbed under there and I gave the tablecloth a haircut. Not fun at the time. But was he different? I think he was also different because I think my mother was probably an early feminist in many ways, although I don\u2019t think she called herself that at the time. She was the working partner in the hou -- in the home at the time that I remember, anyway, and she had, apparently, a very unusual and important job for a woman in some kind of financial activity. Just exactly what it was, I never really knew or understood, and - so she was out of my circle for much of the day. She was also not the one who was either as patient or as fun loving as I re-remember my father being. Not that my father was necessarily fun loving, but he was -- h-he smiled readily, as opposed to maybe yelling at me, which is more what I remember from my mother."

            "num": 33,

            "answer": "Right. Well, it wasn\u2019t unusual for people of even modest means to have help in those days. I mean, this is now the 30\u2019s we\u2019re talking. And we did have what was known as a meisje, or a girl, who -- who worked for us, and -- and in fact I remember -- I -- I remember s -- being served, when I was still in my crib, I remember her bringing me breakfast in the crib, and the breakfast consisted of these things called Dutch rusk. I don\u2019t know if you know what those are, but it\u2019s sort of a light and airy kind of toasty thing of about a half an inch thick. And she always had them drenched in honey. And so she would bring me these things in the crib, and the honey would be all over the place, and I hated it. I just despised it, and everything was st -- then sticky and drippy, and you know, and you can imagine a toddler in the crib, and the honey. So yes, I think she was probably one that took care of us."

            "answer": "Oh yes, very clearly, because I -- in addition to -- to a meisje who was taking care of us, she obviously as the big sister was often put in charge, and I always resented that terribly. And I think my poor sister suffered horribly because of that, because I would probably always giver her a hard time. I guess I was fairly headstrong. I\u2019m not above throwing a temper tantrum and screaming, yelling and crying, and my poor sister had to put up with all that. So -- yeah, and -- and basically, I think my sister and I are -- are -- are somewhat different personalities to begin with. So I don\u2019t think that was an easy thing for her, and -- and it wasn\u2019t fun for me, you know, and there was -- it created this sister sibling sort of irritation. I because I didn\u2019t want to be told that I couldn\u2019t do something, and she because I didn\u2019t want to do what she said I had to do."

            "num": 41,
            "question": "Right, right. What was the house like where you lived? Did you live in an apartment, did you live in a house?",
            "answer": "No, actually we lived in -- we lived in this very, very -- I guess bourgeois is probably the English equivalent word for it, but in a -- a very, very nice residential area, not too far from the Riyksmuseum, on the Pieter de Hooch Straat. And it was all residential, so there was no commercial activity going on there at all, which makes the presence of what was going on in our house even more puzzling, because my mother worked in the house, in -- in two rooms of our house was this contore or -- or office, as she would call it. And in Holland as you -- well, certainly in Amsterdam, all the houses are built so that they are smack up against each other. And there is no sort of stand alone housing. And it goes all the way around the four sides of a block that way. And what you have is people living on the ground floor, people living on the first floor, and another couple second, and another on the third. And then the house part, what we called ground floor, or caw -- or house, has access to the backyards. And the backyards are all pretty private, all surrounded by wooden fences, both in the middle and on the sides. So you really have a-again, a -- a greater European sense of privacy, while at the same time you can see into those yards from the first, second and third floor, not only of your building, but the one next to you on either side, and the one behind you from the other street. So there\u2019s -- yes, there is privacy, and no there isn\u2019t privacy in -- in some way. And this house that we had was brick, as most houses were, and there is not the front lawn kind of thing, and there\u2019s not the -- the curb lawn and so forth as we know it here, but -- but a city street, really, although it was residential. And we had -- that was unusual too, we had the ground floor, the house part and the first floor. But the first f -- two rooms of the ground floor were this office. But there was nothing on the front door, there was no mark of any kind, or title, or -- or -- or whatever. So I\u2019m still a little bit at a loss as to what this outfit was, I\u2019m only learning now from my sister who were the name -- what were the names of some of the -- well, I did know one of the names, th-the boss was Mr. Halle. And I know that my mother disappeared in these two rooms for much of the day, but that\u2019s about the extent of it."

But because as I explained you can look into these yards, very often I would run into the yard and call up to her and she would come running out to the veranda, and so forth, and then she\u2019d say, oh I will come over, or whatever. And she\u2019d come over and play in our yard because we had the yard and they didn\u2019t, they only had the veranda. And -- and of course one of my very earliest hurtful and -- and shocking memories is of me doing exactly that, running out one day, as I did so many days and calling up to her to come out and play and she came to the edge of the veranda and she yelled dirty Jew at me and spat on me from the veranda. And I think it was the first really sort of crushing childhood blow for -- for what that means when someone does that to you.

            "answer": "I have a clear recollection of the beginning of this sort of -- what I later understood as a really sort of maniacal way of building up the fear in the population. So the first time that I was aware that there was a major difference going on outside my home was the fact that I had started school, and then I had stopped school. So that was probably the first, although it might have been preceded by taking one of these walks with my dad, and the same wonderful walks that we used to take, and going down the street, I remember the -- there was a school opposite our house. It wasn\u2019t the school that I went to, but it was some other school, and again there was no lawn in the front, but they did have these sort of both ornamental and -- and physical heavy iron chains. And I used to love to sit on those and swing on them. But I wasn't doing that with my father, we were - we were going out for a walk and going down the block and turning right as we did, and I remember there on the opposite, diagonally opposite side of the street used to be an empty lot. And all of a sudden this particular day we went there, and it was all surrounded in wooden fencing, but not your attractive fencing or whatever, but in these -- it\u2019s the stuff that they used to have around baseball -- corner lot baseball thing -- I mean, I don\u2019t know -- exactly know how to say it, but you couldn\u2019t -- there were these vertical planks next to each other and you couldn\u2019t look through them. And so all of a sudden there is no empty lot except for this wooden fencing all around, and all of a sudden there is an opening in the fence, a door and a -- and a Nazi soldier walks out. And he is striding down the street and he comes towards my father and he asks him for a light for his cigarette. And I -- I remember almost as if it was yesterday, that my father, this patient, gentle man, really tensed, and lit the soldier\u2019s cigarette. And the soldier very politely said thank you and walked on. And my father swore under his breath. And I could sense this man\u2019s behavior was so out of character from how I knew him, that I knew that there was something amiss, but I, again had no -- no -- certainly no knowledge at the time what that meant. And what he said under his breath was Rotmof. Rotmof being the -- mof being the derogatory term used for the Nazis, and the rot meaning rotten. You know, so he was saying basically, rotten Nazi. And I didn\u2019t know what Nazi meant, and I couldn\u2019t understand why he would be saying this. I -- when I saw this soldier coming out I didn\u2019t know s -- I didn\u2019t know from soldiers, I really didn\u2019t understand anything.

            "answer": "Right. I don\u2019t have any real recollection, but having just visited her, as we are always wont to do, we tend to try to spend some time both reminiscing and sort of corroborating memories. And we\u2019 ve tried to make that a little bit more formal project, but that hasn\u2019t worked too well because of our individual lives sort of diverging and so on. But she shared with me, and I actually have it, I haven\u2019t had a chance to look at it, a book that was written about what happened at that time, to her school and her schoolmates. And -- and herself for that matter. What -- what happened was that before the stopping of school, what -- what was done was one of these many decrees that was offered. And the decree was that no -- that all the Jewish children had to go to the Jewish school -- to a Jewish school, or a school that was set aside as a Jewish school. Now, why they didn\u2019t do that with the elementary school kids, I don\u2019t know, and for all I know they did, except perhaps it was too far, or it -- my folks didn\u2019t think it was important, I don\u2019t know. But for the high school, they did set aside something wa -- which they called the joodse -- I think it was called the joodse lyceum. And so -- so all the Jewish kids were sort of pulled out of their s -- respective schools and told to go to this one school. And then they were tol -- and then were told there wasn\u2019t going to be any more school at all for the Jewish kids. And then, what I just learned, which I didn\u2019t know, was that apparently many of the teachers continued to try to teach these kids, and that the kids were meeting at respective parent\u2019s homes, as many of -- of them as could. And this book that she showed me was a book that was written by her -- one of her teachers from the gymnasium, who came with these kids and -- and taught them. I think I have this correct. And the book is basically not only a story of how this unfolded, and how they moved from whose home to which home and where it was located, and what happened when a particular student wasn\u2019t there, and everyone knew what had happened, which was that that family had been called up and deported. So there was this constant threat that ran through the meetings for however long they were able to -- to -- to carry on, about people disappearing, and the students being quite aware of this, and the teachers being very aware of this. And yet, trying to continue to keep going and to keep going, and then as I say, I have not had a chance to look at this book, but the book has since -- she was also interviewed for that. And one of the appendices in the book has the lists of all the students by the year that they should have been in -- in this school, and basically tells you what, to the best of this man\u2019s a-ability, happened to each of these, and -- and how -- how this all just came to pass. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s all there documented and the -- and the difficulties of meeting in the homes, and the -- and the effort on people to try to create some sense of normalcy for these kids, who were clearly much, much, much more aware of what was happening than I certainly was. I mean, I had not a clue that she was even doing this at the time."

I -- I knew nothing of that as a child, so that may account in part for why I didn\u2019t see more of that. And it wasn\u2019t really until I was an adult and I s-studied lots of stuff, including the whole psychological phenomena of -- of labeling and what that means. And -- and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with a very, very powerful piece that was done right after Martin Luther King died, by the teacher in Riceville, Iowa, which \u201cFrontline\u201d featured on PBS, and I have since used with my students a good many times, which is just basically having the children experience what happens when you do -- do label and stigmatize people. Sometimes it\u2019s called -- the program is called, \u201cBlue Eyes, Brown Eyes.\u201d There\u2019s another version of it that also takes this woman into prisons and other areas of -- in -- of human interaction where she tries the same thing with adults, and it works almost more successfully even. And -- and that\u2019s called, \u201cThe Eye of the Storm.\u201d I\u2019ve forgotten which one comes first, but -- and then she also has another -- she has a reunion with that first class with whom she tries it, and it 1s incredible how positive the influence on these people this early exercise was, where, you know, she -- she makes the attempt to have the children understand what it\u2019s like when you do that to people. And she separates them according to the color of their eyes. And then she says to the children, you know, I understand that -- first she tries it with whatever, blue eyes, and she says, I understand that you - | -- | have just learned that -- that blue eyed people are just not as smart as brown eyed people. And then later in the day she says, you know, they\u2019re not even as attentive, and they\u2019re not as good as -- you know, she goes on and on with this. And then she said, you know what, we should label these people so that we can more easily recognize them, and then we don\u2019t have to choose them on the team, and we don\u2019t have to play with them, because they\u2019re not as smart as we are. And so why don\u2019t we put collars on them. And then you see this whole effect of what this labeling does to these third or fourth graders. And -- and 1-1-1t\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s an eye opener.

And he said all of a sudden the kids, his buddies at school took this as formal approval of doing stuff like yelling epithets at people who were wearing the star. I -- I mean, th-they took this as open season, essentially, so that there was a yi -- and he -- he recalled -- I remember this very clearly, he recalled when we were doing our joint recollections, walking home from school with a bunch of his friends, and there was an old man who was wearing the star and was clearly elderly and so forth and so on, and that the boys who the day before had been perfectly polite and passed this man without any events happening at all, started to stone him. Now, you know, here you have this kind of institutional approval because as -- you now say to everybody, we\u2019ve labeled these people as untermenschen, as dirt, as people that you can do anything you like with. I mean, it\u2019s unfortunately a little bit of I think what we did in Vietnam is we socialized the soldiers to be willing to do unheard of, inhuman things. I mean, what these guys did in My Lai didn\u2019t come about because someone wanted to have a heyday. So -- so the dehumanizing effect that you can create, that you can program essentially, you can socialize people to participate in, even though their teachings and everything else would have you believe that they wouldn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t. And happily there were people who didn\u2019t, and who stood up. But then -- then you see then the Nazis come in and they manipulate that, so they arrest the people who were protecting Jews, or they have a shooting in the square to basically call attention to anyone who was trying to live up to his or her Protestant or Catholic teachings, and not do this to their fellow human beings. But it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it makes you think about how incredibly thin the layer of civilization really is. And when the chips are down, you know, the scapegoating, the stereotyping, the labeling all play one against, another against, but with the other, to -- to create -- I don\u2019t know what it is about us that we always have to feel better than somebody, and in order to feel better we have to put someone else down.

Now, I\u2019m beginning to have a little different sense, and -- and actually for a number of reasons. But a -- as I understood it, it was somewhere around this time that -- that the Dutch government basically was a sort of government under the aegis of a Dutch -- a -- no, I think 1t was a Dutch Nazi general some -- some sort of person like that, named Seyss-Inquart, who was basically put in charge, where the -- whereas the queen -- I guess the queen and the -- and the royalty wasn\u2019t exactly the ruling figure anyway, given the Dutch combination of a constitutional monarchy, and so on. But the queen left for England and the prince and princess and their children left for Canada. And -- and actually later on I-I remember hearing some broadcasts of the queen speaking to us from England and so on. But so this -- this -- putting this person in charge again, was -- was one of these pieces that I didn\u2019t -- I wasn't aware of at the time. I mean, what does a little kid know about government and how it operates? I didn\u2019t know where the rules were coming from that were being asked -- well, were being laid down. I knew that there was something about the fact that we were not any longer having lots of red, white and blue flags out, and orange streamers on the flag poles, which all represented Holland and the House of Orange. I don\u2019t remember seeing Nazi flags either, but I didn\u2019t see the Dutch flags. And -- and it was again one of these ways of making things seem like they were normal. So there was a government and it was issuing decrees, and this was a Dutch, presumably -- th-there was a fair amount of collusion among the Dutch. Something that only has come to my knowledge somewhat from the experiences I had, but much more -- more real when I became an adult and read a little bit more, and heard a little bit more, because I'd always grown up thinking, you know, the Dutch were so wonderful, and the Dutch basically saved me, and my sister and my mother. And they did that also to some other Jews. But there was also a lot of collusion going on. The NSB was -- the NSB was known as the party that was in collusion with the Nazis. And it was -- 1-1t was probably a way in which -- in which all politics and occupation works, and which uncomfortably I\u2019m aware of, the United States does likewise, which is you find your way in to some society by a group of people with whom you associate and with whom you vision a common goal and you infiltrate, basically. And so the -- the amount of collusion there was rather shockingly high, from my perspective. Not one I\u2019m tremendously proud of. Holland, on the other hand, has had a long, historical tradition of religious freedom, going back to William of Orange, and was probably also one of the reasons that the Jews found receptive ground and receptive society, because they fled from so many places of persecution, including Spain. So -- and actually my -- my grandparents, my father\u2019s parents came -- now I don\u2019t know if they directly or their parents came up from Spain, but then actually that\u2019s something that I\u2019m hoping at some point to get back to The Netherlands and do some of that research, because Holland and all other countries besides the U.S. have, of course, this incredible record keeping and documents, archive stuff going back to the Middle Ages, and so I\u2019m hoping to do some of that research myself."

            "question": "He just goes out. So the door closes, and your mother now makes a very radical decision. And what 1s that?",
            "answer": "Well, in retrospect, I don\u2019t know how radical it was, but she basically grabbed a bag, and I still remember the looks of the bag, it was sort of a yucky brown, n-no -- not an attractive bag, but some sort of satchel [indecipherable] satchel of some sort of plastic or leather, or something, and throws in a hairbrush, and a toothbrush and -- for each of us, grabs our jackets, takes us by the hand and walks out the door, literally walks out the door and closes the door behind her. And we walked -- a -- a -- and we -- she -- we had to come down steps, it was up a couple steps, and we came down s -- and walked into the street and I remember being aware of the fact that it was curfew, because Jews were not allowed on the street, because there was a curfew. They were not allowed on the trolleys, they were not allowed in the libraries, they were not allowed in the parks. Alla -- aya -- they were not allowed in school. And -- and these decrees, by the way, were not given all at once, they were -- this is why I keep reminding m-myself and others about the mind that was operating to keep upping the ante, to keep this level of normalcy, but just enough fear and enough intrusion into the way of life that 1t was clear who was in charge. So one decree would be about you can\u2019t use the libraries, and you -- so you say to yourself, well, alright, we can get along without the library. Next time it\u2019s the park. Well, you know, we\u2019ll play in the backyard, we go -- we won\u2019t take walks. So it -- always it\u2019s also somehow to contain the population you\u2019re affecting, by making them adjust all the time. And -- and that adjustment, which is again something that if I -- if 1 can I may come back to later, but it\u2019s -- on the one hand, it\u2019s a peculiar characteristic of us humans, that we can adjust to an incredible amount of stuff before we say stop. And in one sense we should have said stop right there, and we should have risen up and we should have said we won\u2019t take this. And of course there were efforts at doing that, sporadically here and there. But by and large, the effect of this layering 1s to keep the people from not boiling the waters, and doing what I think Jewish populations have done since time immemorial as guests in new societies, which is to say, well, you know, if we do what they ask, if we just comply with what people are asking us to do, then they\u2019Il leave us alone. But they didn\u2019t leave us alone. And so that\u2019s -- that always is something that comes to my mind when things happen, and I say, well should we accept this, or should we stand up and fight right here? And it a -- and one of these things happened in my town in Massachusetts where the question came should we make a noise about this or should we not. And -- and the general feeling of the Jewish community was led by the rabbi, which was, w-w-well, you know, we\u2019ll just let this go by kind of thing. And mine, s -- much to my surprise, cause I\u2019m not necessarily a person who makes waves, but I said this is wrong. It\u2019s not right, and we should be -- here in America we should be calling attention to the fact that this is wrong. But anyway, the effect of this layering, as I say, was -- w-was t-to keep people in compliance, and to, at the same time instill this modicum of fear and anxiety. And -- and I -- I -- I don\u2019t know what my father\u2019s feeling was at that point when he was taken away. I don\u2019t know whether he himself had an inkling that this was different, or whether he really did think he was coming back, or -- I -- I -- I really don\u2019t know what they thought, and whether this is a question of radical behavior on my mother\u2019s part, yes and no, and it\u2019s probably a dual answer because as we walked across the city, and I longingly looking at the trolleys, I remember that cause I was little kid and I was tired and I wanted to ride. And the trolleys, I remember this eerie feeling as the trolleys were going by and I was -- they were totally empty. There would be one person sitting in the trolleys, because -- not that -- that the non-Jews weren\u2019t allowed on the trolleys, but the general tenor in the -- in the country was beginning to be much more concerned and so people weren\u2019t out going to the theater and doing stuff. And I remember us walking through the archway of the Rijksmuseum, which is a gorgeous Victorian building with all its towers and spires and so forth and part of it is arched over a roadway which at that time still had the old fashioned heavy cobblestones that were like little miniature hills, each one of them. And our steps were re-echoing in that archway as we walked through, and I remember feeling a certain amount of fear. Cause I knew we were not supposed to be out. And I knew that my mother was afraid and that she was anxious and we had to hurry and we had to be quiet. And I knew that we couldn\u2019t help ourselves, there was this clatter of the footsteps. And so the sense that somebody might be coming for us, or coming after us was definitely there, in -- in my head at that time, because I remember the feeling. I didn\u2019t know why, but I had the feeling. I knew that we were leaving and that we were going someplace else and we- we -- the -- where we lived was called Amsterdam South, it was the southern part of the country, and -- o-of the city, and we went to Amsterdam West, which was across town, through the western part, which was a much more commercial area."

            "answer": "That\u2019s true. Well, that\u2019s true, and of course there was this whole other activity that was going on, that I only learned about later, which was -- well, some of which I n -- I was aware of, which is that everybody had to have identity cards, and the Jewish ones had a big J stamped on it. And I also knew, and I -- this was before, I believe before my father was taken, that a friend of the family, who was a minister, actually provided us with fake baptism papers. Because -- I-I remember that at the time, and I remember sort of hearing about it, and perhaps even be -- being given one of those t-to have on my person. And of course, initially it was, I think as I mentioned, first when they started doing the calling up of Jews -- first of all, they also instituted another one of their pieces of madness. They started this thing called Joods Raad, which was basically translated as the Jewish councils. They -- they took various I-leaders within the Jewish community and created a kind of a self governance piece, so that essentially they gave them the orders of what they wanted done, and they made them responsible for carrying it out. So now what you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re creating this horrendous thing between people of the same marked, steri -- stigmatized group and saying, you do the dirty work, you choose who\u2019s going to be called up next. You are the ones that promulgates the decrees of n-not -- no access of the schools and this and that and the other. So the Jewish councils were having to do this to their own people. And the -- the -- the tendency to first of all condemn these people roundly, I think 1s very great, because you\u2019re saying, you know, what the hell were you doing tell -- sending us off to the -- be slaughtered. By the same token, I don\u2019t think they were all doing it from that perspective. I think some of them were doing it because, as I said before, they thought that well, if we just comply with that they\u2019re asking, and maybe I can help to keep my people sort of understanding that if we just keep calm and do what they ask, we can get through this all right. I think they were doing it from that perspective, some of them. I think others probably were doing it to save their own skins, sort of either realizing whatever was happening it wasn\u2019t good, but if they volunteered to do this, then maybe they would not have to go. And I have to say that, coming through this experience, I don\u2019t think any of us is ever able to say what we would or would not do under any circumstances such as these. I don\u2019t think you know what you\u2019re capable of doing, I don\u2019t think you know what you\u2019re capable of tolerating, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re cap -- yo-you have any sense of the reality of w-what you might do if you or your family members were under siege or in peril of losing their lives. I just think it\u2019s impossible."

But the reason for these certificates also was that initially -- oh, I guess I lost track of the flow of this, initially they called up the refugees from eastern Europe and deported those, and made nice space available in Westerbork and so forth, and then they began to deport various among the Jews. Now who they were and why these people were chosen, I don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t know if perhaps my father was instrumental in perhaps helping other people get papers or something like that, I don\u2019t know. This went -- first they started calling up the people who were full blooded Jews. And then, when there were no more of those -- and of course, you say, or you might say, how did they know who those people were? Well, this is where this incredible record keeping. All they had to do was go to the municipal offices and get the birth records and the this and the that and the other. And -- and they did that. They did an incredible amount of this kind of spade work. So they would s -- first call up the ones who were hundred percent Jewish, and then they would call up the people who were 75 percent Jewish. And then they would call up the people who were 50 percent Jewish. And then they would call up the people who had -- the one ha-half of a couple who had intermarried, and they would leave the others. And this -- this is what gave rise to the papers. Could you show that you had not -- no -- were no longer Jewish? But it didn\u2019t help, because after awhile they said it didn\u2019t count, that -- you know, at first, yes, they\u2019d leave you alone, cause now you were not Jewish.

And I - I could be wrong about that, but -- and I often thought about this afterwards, and I thought, why would she not want to go when this was on the horizon? And I think it was just such an incredible disbelief that this would ever. I mean, it\u2019s like so many things that face us, and you kind of think, no, I mean it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s probably just in human nature that you ke -- you have to either get your head in the wave rolling over you, or you have to be enormously courageous, or maybe a little bit crazy, or even stupid by some people\u2019s judgment, to drop everything, to drop this good job that she had, to leave this lovely house and all the -- the material things and take off for no man\u2019s la -- I mean, America? [indecipherable] not that it was no man\u2019s land, in fact she had an uncle I know who came back and brought her s -- her brother some gifts and brought her some things from the United States and so on. So she knew about the United States. But she apparently said no, but then my father -- so the story goes, my father who took my uncle to the boat, apparently said to him, if anything ever happens to us, will you see to my children? And, you know, I\u2019ve heard this story repeated from my uncle, and then also from my sister, but I didn\u2019t know about it. So if there was something pre-thought, or predicted, or anticipated, 1t must have come from both the news and reading what happened around Europe and this was coming closer and closer, and then actually having my father arrested. So, between my brother fleeing -- my -- her brother, my mother\u2019s brother fleeing, and saying to his sister, why don\u2019t you drop everything and come, and the actual things that happened after he left, they must have done some things, including the fact that when we finally ended up at the home where we -- where we were hidden for the war, and led into the basement, there in the basement were two beds that I recognized as having come from my home, and a quilt and some blankets that I knew were from home.

And this s-street was different from my street, in that it was clearly a somewhat later period when it was built, because the housing was very much the same in the sense that the houses were up tight against each other, there was not space in between. And it -- they went all the way around the block, and it was a house floor and first, second and third apartment. But the house floor in this case, was the store, was the commercial establishment. And it had a store window. And so there was a portico between two stores, and in that portico, you had first of all the -- on the left side the store entrance, then you had another entrance that went to the three apartments upstairs, and then you had another apartment entrance for the three apartments in this side, and another store door that went into this place, which we now entered. And the store was a liquor store. And it turned out that my mom and my sister, which I now know, knew this person who opened the door."

In any case, we were basically whisked inside and -- a-and shown to -- through the store, into the back of the store, which was sort of -- these people were of very modest means, they were people who were living in back of the store, which was not usually what people did. They had an apartment someplace else in town, or perhaps upstairs above the store, but they tended not to have as their permanent residence, the little bitty living spaces in the back of the ha -- of the store. And when we came to the back of the store, and went out of the actual store part, there was a little, small sort of in-between room, and in one end of the wall there was -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s often spoken of as a typical Dutch arrangement with the bed inside the wall. And in that recessed bed was a much elderly man, and much older than the woman, and it was her husband, and he was also ailing in some way, I don\u2019t remember exactly what. And -- and his name was Uncle John, I mean he was referred to as onc -- ome -- ome -- Oome Sjon. And then w-we were shown another door, and the door led down into the basement. And we went down the stairs in the basement, and there was a basement that ran all the way from underneath the storefront, all the way to the backyard. And in the part underneath the storefront, this is how modestly, if not poor these people were, their only son had a curtained off area that was his room, his place. And there were very few material things there, or anyplace else in the house. And then we turned to go towards the part that was closest to the backyard, and to these two sort of recessed, if you will, windows. I mean, it was sort of like -- I guess it\u2019s what you call a bulkhead, out in the yard. And instead of a door there were these glass windows. But it meant that there was a sort of sunken well with -- with -- with some iron bars across the top where people stepped 1-in the yard. And -- and the only way to get any light or air would be to open those. And of course, it rains a lot in Holland as it did then, and these wells would fill up with water, up to the top practically, and we had to -- I remember we took turns trying to siphon that out, by mouth, literally, to get the water out of those things so that we could open them and have some air. But anyway, when we came into this cellar and went towards the yard part, that\u2019s where I saw two beds covered in quilts and blankets, or a quilt and -- and blanket that I remembered from my home. So that\u2019s when it first registered on me, even at that young age, that somehow this was part of what the grown-ups had in mind, something that they\u2019d already planned. And that first night we just went to bed, that I remember."

And then in the next few days, we were down in the basement and we were -- the store was still operating, so the store was open and there were people coming and going and so on. And -- and the -- the woman of the house, whose name was Katoos Koolhaas Revers, who we called Tante Toos, or cut -- it\u2019s a short form of Katoos, and tante, of course, is aunt. And she took care of the infirm husband, and the young son, who was a few years older than my sister, so a teenager, and -- and the store, as long as it ran. And we were in the basement and then for a fairly short period of time, we were, every few days or so, were allowed to kind of come up in the yard and sit and have a cup of tea or something, for a short while, as if to say to the neighbors who might have been looking in from three sides of this block, 1f you remember how I spaced this out, who might have been wondering who were these people that were suddenly over there. So we looked like visitors, or we were trying to act like visitors. And during this period there were still lots of people on this commercial street. Every day the stores would open, and of course you had your butcher and baker and gr- greengrocer, and stationary store. I mean, you didn\u2019t go to the market there, th -- you went to the individual stores, and you didn\u2019t have supermarkets, certainly, or grocery stores. And -- well, you, yes you had grocery stores, but they only dealt with, let\u2019s say, dry good and so on. So at first it was decided that -- that it was okay for me to go out and meet -- mix and mingle with the crowd because I -- and this is when I heard it said, that I looked the least Jewish. Now, what did that mean? Uh-huh, and my guess is that since my sister is somewhat darker haired than I am, and also older, and might have been less comfortable pretending to be someone she wasn\u2019t, they thought it was okay for me to get out there and play and then just pretend that I was visiting an aunt, in case I was stopped. And this was also when I was supposed to be somebody other than Hedy Cohen, which was, of course, my maiden name, and in -- and I was drilled, actually, before being allowed out, to say that my name was Hedy Vermeulen, and that I lived at, you know, some other place, but that I was visiting my aunt over here. That stopped fairly soon, that I wasn\u2019t allowed to go out any more."

And somehow she prevailed. And -- and actually, when you asked before -- or maybe you didn\u2019t ask, but I said something about this -- the business of the yards, and people being able to see.

So the business of being seen, and the business of being in the yard, and the bi -- 1-1t -- 1t was a tremendous danger not just for us, but for the family who was sheltering us. And so this proved to be an enormous burden for -- for -- not only for the people who were doing the hiding but the people who were being hidden, to the point that there is a lot of evidence of people who apparently couldn\u2019t tolerate putting this kind of danger on the people they loved, and they would get themselves arrested. They would either run out during a search, and run into the street somewhere far away from the house that they had been in. And they were usually shot, or rounded up, or brought in or whatever. But that was not an infrequent phenomenon, because it was so terrible to -- everybody knew what was going to happen. And then the rewards were such that, I mean, when you think of the pettiness of, you know, something the equivalent of a dollar, or five dollars, would be the reward if you could give the Nazis a tip that would lead to some arrests or other. And people were out doing this. They were out trying to collect these rewards. And you didn\u2019t know who would and who wouldn\u2019t. So -- and in some cases I know it happened within families where -- and this might have been the case here, but it wasn\u2019t, where the brother was So opposed to having his sister do this.

So there was some of this tension between the two mothers. A-About what, I don\u2019t remember, do I have an example, no. I just knew it was there. And because there was such a spread in ages, it was also difficult. There was s -- at least then, before my mother died, there was this. There was also a kind of o-obvious -- and I -- and I have to confess that this is a thought that came long after and not before. I knew there was tension between the two parents as mothers, and kids have an intuition about that stuff. But there was something else and that had to do with the fact that clearly my mother -- my mother\u2019s freedom as a mother and a parent, and her freedom as far as objecting to and disagreements, and- | mean to -- to the kinds of disagreements, was severely limited because of the nature of this relationship. We were totally and completely dependent on this family. So my mother must have, many, many times, been severely pressed for patience and understanding and compromise and so on. There was nothing she could do. I mean, basically her only alternative was to be quiet and acquiesce, or to leave. And -- and clearly she surely didn\u2019t want to do that, because there were the two of us also. I don\u2019t know what she would have done if it was just herself. So there was probably no real outlet for all that kind of frustration. Plus the fact that we were getting -- we were getting some letters from my father, and they c -- apparently came from different camps as he was being transported from one to the other, to the other, and then eventually the last |-letters came from Auschwitz. And the letters were always censored. They were alway -- they had heavy, heavy black lines drawn through writing, and there was no way -- I remember my mother holding them up to the light and putting them over a bright light and on -- so forth and so on. They could not see what was -- what was under that. And they came to us via a very roundabout route, having to do with some of Tante Toos\u2019s family.

Then there was another dynamic that took place here in this confined quarter. First of all there was probably this -- this little kid who was always sort of -- sort of in-between and in the way and what have you. There was another dynamic going on between my sister and the young boy, after a fairly short time. And every time I think about this whole experience, and as I then moved on in my life later and worked with young people and studied young people and everything else, I am always caught by the uniqueness of that ad-adolescent era that each of us has, but which in my sister\u2019s case was so totally rent asunder, so that just at the point when life opens up for you and you\u2019re no longer quite a child and you\u2019re now moving into domains of knowledge and you\u2019re beginning to have some feeling of what the world\u2019s about, and when you start thinking about future and making plans and having relationships, and having groups of friends, and beginning to pull away from your -- your parental u-unit as the kids used to say.

Yes, I was disappointed I couldn\u2019t go to school and so on, but the -- to compare that to what must have happened to my sister, 1t must have been so awful, to have everything just kind of collapsed, to have everything just sort of literally having the rug pulled out from under you and now you are in this sort of prison, sort of confinement, really. And then the knowledge that our very lives and futures depended on being able to s -- to make the most of what we have here, and to be able to get along, and to be able to make it work.

            "answer": "-- but the fact 1s that we did that. And initially there were ration cards handed out for available food. And of course, instead of three people there were now six people in this house. And so it fell to Hans to -- the young boy, to go out and scour up -- I don\u2019t know how, black market, whatever, to go find more ration points, and -- cards. And so he did that reasonably successfully until there wasn\u2019t any more food that was handed out, and -- and little by little the shops all closed, one after the other, after the other, and had heavy wooden shutters to protect them from vandalism and people growing quite desperate for food. And then for awhile they had set up soup kitchens, where you could come with your ration points and get potato peel soup and that came back with Hans and he would -- we would all share that, of course. And -- and even the -- the liquor store now was closing, cause there was nothing, there was -- there was no more liquor left for the population and so that -- those doors closed. And there were bottles of colored water that were in the display window and so on. But he would go and -- and occasionally try to dig up something and apparently came back once with a smoked eel, one eel. And Holland\u2019s specialty of course, 1s all versions of fish, of all kinds. Smoked and pickled and you name it. And the one eel was divided among six people. And the piece that I got was the one that had the head. And what I didn\u2019t realize is that there was a h-hook in the head, and trying to get every last morsel of edible food out of this thing, I got the fishhook stuck in my tongue. And we are now in the basement, right, and I knew somehow, don\u2019t ask me how, that I shouldn\u2019t make a noise, that I shouldn\u2019t scream, that I -- and even that spontaneous reaction that you think I would have had, was suppressed. Which probably came from by now having lots of times being told, don\u2019t make any noise, you\u2019ve got to keep quiet, you can only whisper, and so on. Because for the first part of our hiding, the -- there was activity going on upstairs and there were people in and out of the store. And so we couldn\u2019t really talk, we couldn't really make any noises. And -- and somehow I remembered this, and my mother came over and she worked the fishhook out of my mouth and -- and that was that. But that -- again, how did I know how -- how did I control that impulse? I don\u2019t know, I just did. You sort of wonder often about how it is that you do those things as a small child, or a big child. I mean, big child I think it\u2019s mo -- it\u2019s a little easier to figure it out. When you\u2019re a small child, you kind of say, how did that work, you know? What was in my head? And I don\u2019t know what was in my head. I think I just felt it, just felt the whole atmosphere, the whole -- whole sense of -- everything was dangerous, everything about life was dangerous. And so you -- you kept a low profile and you didn\u2019t talk loud and you didn\u2019t scream and -- awful really, when you think about the effect of that on a small kid."

And -- and I\u2019m sure she did some -- S-See again, we ha -- we had nothing, we ha -- we even had no paper. You couldn\u2019t get anything any more. You couldn\u2019t get crayons, you couldn\u2019t get colored -- well, we didn\u2019t really have crayons like they have Crayolas here. We had colored pencils and we had a few because when the newspapers were still being published -- which also stopped, but while they were being published we didn\u2019t have the comic section like you do here, but we did have one which I recognized later was a political cartoon and -- and it was on the back of the front page of De Telegraaf, which was the sort of -- s-sa -- probably right of center newspaper. And I would cut out -- after people had gotten through with the paper, I would cut out this little two or three frame thing and -- and color it with a few colored pencils that we had and that\u2019s one way I kept busy. And I loved these characters, I thought they were just so much fun, but again, I was an animal lover. And this was tom poes, which was tomcat, and Ollie B. Bommel. And Ollie B. Bommel was a bear, and he was a pretty dumb bear. And so it was always the smart cat who was rescuing him out of awkward situations or correcting his erroneous thinking. And so the political stuff kind of came through that. And this was my p-precious possession from -- from all of those years, and it\u2019s one of the few things that I had at the end of the war, cause I collected all these things until they stopped publishing, and I took them with me to America, and I kept them in the attic and so forth and so on, and then at some later date many years later when I met my husband and he came to visit at the house and so forth, and I told him about this. And he said, \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cdo you have those around?\u201d I said oh yeah, and so I brought them down from the attic, and he opened the box and he grabbed them and the first thing he did was flip them over on the other side, because there were the headlines of what was going on during those early years. And I haven\u2019t tried to piece those headlines together, but I have started to do some research now on -- actually on the original newspapers, to see what was the context within which all of my personal experience was taking place."

Now one thing that I remember doing, I -- I know that because of the severely confined circumstances in which we were, and if you remember, I mentioned the fact that these people were not very well off in this little daytime place for -- for the proprietors of the -- of the shop, th -- but the shop was part of the Chrispijn liquor store chain. It was a big, well-known company, and -- and Tante Toos was the proprietress of this -- this particular one store. But part of what -- what was also very difficult is that because it was only meant for daytime habitation, there was only a little half bathroom. There was only a toilet with a little teeny sink, just enough to wash your hands, as most toilet rooms are in -- in Europe. An-And there was no shower, and there was no bathtub. So matters of hygiene had to be taken care of rather differently, in basins and lots of hand washing and so on. And lots of washing, I mean. And also, I think what was -- I mean, this actually took time, I mean you had to carry water in basins and bring it downstairs and so on. And I remember my mother 1-in very short order, decided I had to cut my -- or she was going to cut my long hair, cause I had long pigtails. And I remember not being very happy about that, but there wasn\u2019t any question, it wasn\u2019t do we have to, it was just -- it was done. Because she saw no way to keep washing hair in this difficult, confined situation. The other thing that happened during this time is when I learned to read, I found that Hans, our gentle, young man in the house, probably the only thing the guy owned was a set of books that was in his part of the cellar, which had been curtained off, and it was on a shelf in his part of the cellar. It was a series of books about the American Indians, about the Apaches in particular. And it was a series written by what I understand is an Austrian author, who apparently never set foot in the States, and I understand has done amazingly accurate writings and portraits of what went on among the Apaches.

And in the evening when it was really good and dark, we would come upstairs and spend some time upstairs, usually huddled around this clandestine radio, or as -- in fact, I seem to remember that we did not eat upstairs, so -- and -- and speaking of the eating as -- I think I was telling you about the potato peel soup. You know, after that -- after that stopped, there was nothing. There was absolutely nothing, and everything was shuttered and everything was a ghost town, all the stores were completely shuttered down with wooden protection shutters and so on. And -- and we heard stories about people doing all kinds of desperate things, you know, hunting down pets that belonged to somebody [indecipherable] or something, in the streets, and -- and going out to the country to try to find rabbits and so on. And another element of my parent\u2019s planning for this possible eventuality came in the sense that aside from the beds that I saw there, and the quilts that I saw there, when I came upstairs one day and saw also this set of dishes that I mentioned before, there were, next to the set of dishes were bags, large bags of staples. Just the way you find them in a natural food store, they were sacks of raw beans and peas and -- and barley and rice and -- I don\u2019t remember specifically which ones, but ther -- there were all these staples, which really saved all of our lives, because I was fr -- I-I was quite stunned, actually, to read in one of the papers I had been looking at, that they figured that some -- something between 1700 and 2500 people died simply of starvation in the city. And we were just very fortunate to have had this that we could then share with our family. Which -- which certainly saved us. But then that ran out, and that was still -- the war was still on. Also my -- my mother was a bit of a -- probably natural food type vitamin person and she had had -- also saved and put aside vitamins and -- and especially calcium pills, which -- I -- I -- I -- I\u2019ve had rather troubles with teeth, which are thought to have had some basis in the war deprivation. But that -- that was part of what was there, and then when that ran out, then also electricity was out, gas was out, so you had nothing to cook on, you had n-no lights. There was -- for awhile there was wood for the woodstove, the coal stove, 1 -- of course, coal was long gone -- in the living room, but then Hans would go out to the countryside and -- and dig peat, blocks of peat that he would really, literally drag back to -- u-undercover at night. And then after that, a-and there was no more food, he went out in the fields and dug up sugar beets and tulip bulbs, which we basically ground into some kind of mush, and tried to cook, as long as we had anything to cook on. And -- and that\u2019s how we survived during -- during this time. It was horrible stuff, but 1t was what kept us going."

But this wall of mirrors only came up to about five feet, so you could look over it and see people, and see into the living quarters in the back. So there was never any movement above that height, or in the back of the house during the daytime. And at night it was only by -- by being lower than those things in the back or having the lights off -- once the lights were off anyway because there was no electricity, it was a little bit easier for us to move around. But that\u2019s also when we were having these terrible street searches and house searches, where these Gestapo would be patrolling and -- at random, or based on some word that they got from somebody, would actually go and do a house search.

I don\u2019t know how long, 18 feet maybe. And there was a little door in the store side to this, and the little door could open up and then they usu -- usually they kept cases of empty bottles there, or beer -- extra beer supplies, or whatever. So what they did is they took those bottles and crates out of there, we would go in there at night and they would put the empty crates back behind us and then close the door. So the three of us would be in there, and on the street side it was just a -- you saw brick up until the level of the display window, and there were two little grates where you could get some air in this part, and my recollection was always that we were either hunched over, or somehow in some, you know, very uncomfortable position, cause there were three of us in this tiny space. And that one of us was always sort of on the alert that no one else would make noise. I know my guess 1s that my mother was always on the alert. Because the noises, the breathing, the sneezing, what have you, the snoring, could be heard through these vents outside. And you never knew if somebody was actually patrolling the streets, or was out on the street and being silent because they were waiting to catch you, or waiting to have -- to be able to observe one misstep, based on some, you know, intuition they might have had. So you never knew whom to trust, you never knew what was going on, you never had -- you always had this sense of watchfulness, of -- and - and I\u2019m sure that that was part of the anxiety, was probably watchfulness that I was feeling on the part of the adults. And -- and we spent a lot of time in there, and it was a good thing because some of those searches did, in fact, th -- the soldiers went into the basement. It was a logical thing, there was a door.

I found a trunk of material in the garage, which was all of the correspondence that they had had, and my uncle particularly had had over -- since he came to America, first of all, apparently trying to get his parents out of Vienna and appealing to the em -- embassy about getting his parents out of danger, and writing to them about the fact that he had come in 1930 whatever, and he was now able to take care of himself and his -- hi wa -- had brought his wife over and had a good job and so forth, and that he would vouch for them and take care of them, that they would not be a burden on the welfare system and so forth. And that letter that came back was a letter from some state department person saying -- 1t was almost -- it was almost a little sharp, maybe wasn't meant that way, but it was sort of like we\u2019re glad that you -- that you are a-able to take care of yourself, and -- and self-sufficient and so forth and so on, but that does not give you any special privileges. It does not push you ahead of the line of getting people into the country.

And my aunt -- and letters that my uncle and aunt sent to each other when she was still in Vienna and she stayed behind because she was trying to get visas f -- to get her parents and her s -- older sister out to Australia, and all -- and also a meisje, a young woman who worked for them and who had been like their governess and so on. And she succeeded in doing that, and some of the stories she told about how she did this, how she stood in line day after day after day to try to convince the authorities that they should give her these visa for her parents. How she -- she told the stories about some young guy who was really very sweet on her, but she didn\u2019t care about him, and he turned out to be one of the soldiers guarding the line of people standing in line for these visas, and how she kind of maneuvered her way towards the front of the line in terms of this guy, who was now a Nazi, and who made no bones about it. But still was kind of interested in her, and I guess allowed her a couple of notches up the line. And she described to me a couple of times, unfortunately I never got it down, as to what it was like when she went into this enormous room where this Nazi commandant was, and where she had to plead for these visa and exit permits and so forth. And immediately she was addressed as a Jewess, and -- and in German she quoted to me what he said to her, you know, what -- what does this Jewish -- Jewess want, kind of thing, and -- she was an amazing woman, just a gutsy lady with -- with, you know, just a sort of indomitable spirit that I hope all of us can have a piece of, but --"

And she took the last -- she used to tell the story of going home to her apartment and boiling some potatoes and her girlfriend said to her, you know, if I had a husband waiting for me in the United States, I wouldn\u2019t wait for the potatoes to boil.

And she said she w-w-walked very quickly to where the railroad fencing was, and she said and then the Dutch people were there, and they literally pulled her under the fence so the -- the soldiers couldn\u2019t get her.

And then she got to Amsterdam and so forth, and saw my folks and saw me, I guess, when I was two and a half or something, and -- maybe a little older.

So then apparently wrote, and so forth and so on, was interviewed and got a job and - and that\u2019s how he move o -- that\u2019s how he came to Rochester."

And I don\u2019t know if it was the family doctor, or if it was a doctor who was referred to them, or whether Tante Toos\u2019s brothers knew somebody who would do this. In any case, this doctor came sometime in the evening or in the middle of the night and took my mother\u2019s body out of the house and saw to it that she was buried. And in fact, at some point in time when I was back in Holland, I went to see him, he was still in practice at the time, and I -- I wanted to express to him our thanks for not only doing that, but for not turning us in. And he -- he acknowledged my thanks, but he seemed very uncomfortable and didn\u2019t -- seemed sort of aloof, and I don\u2019t know if he didn\u2019t want to remember this awful time, or whether he in fact suffered because of it. I -- I -- I don\u2019t know what the reason was, but he was -- he -- he kept very much apart from -- you know, it was the very, sort of professional demeanor that he showed. That was the second time, as I said. The first time we took somebody in our confidence was as the war wore on, and the Germans were beginning to realize it -- that their lot was going to likely be up, and they made their last ditch efforts. They were running short of soldiers, so they took all the soldiers who were doing the domestic duties in these occupied countries and put them in the front, 1-1-in the war front, and they replaced them by drafting the Dutch boys. And now, our Hans is, of course, draft bait. So it became a matter of hiding him as well. And so four of us couldn\u2019t get into this little -- under the display window thing. And so now -- I don\u2019t know in my description if I made it clear, but we had, between the room where this alcove bed was, and the kitchen, was a little teeny hallway, and there was a hallway on one side and on the other side was the half-bath. And over this hallway and half bath was a low ceiling. But it f -- that low ceiling formed a kind of alcove in the kitchen area. And the kitchen ceiling was very high and kind of extended over that alcove. So what they did is they brought somebody in, a carpenter, who made a false wall for this whole upper alcove area. And he did it with -- with wooden battens, so that it looked like it was part of a -- an existing wall. And one square with battens was left out, so that that provided the entrance, so we would get on a ladder at night and crawl in there, all of use including Hans, and we would leave this square off until somebody gave us the high sign that we better put it on. But here there were -- there was no air intake at all, th -- if we put that thing there, w-we were totally without any -- never mind air flow, but -- but would have -- would have died of suffocation had we had to spend any long time there. And -- and so we spent all the rest of our nights in the -- in the -- in the last parts -- years of the war, there."

So I knew what that meant long before I knew any connection to Judaism or anything. But I knew that she was in mourning. And I spoke a little German for those early years, I must have been three years old at the time. But then she was in a nursing home when we went into hiding. And the word came back to us that -- th-that there had been a round-up of that nursing home, that the trucks had just pulled up in front, that they threw people out the doors and out the verandas like so many chickens going to slaughter.

And -- and some of the p -- some of the writers who have written about these experiences also -- partly you knew what was going on because there was -- there was the knowledge that happened in the east. You knew about the -- you know, they- they pr -- they were first perhaps not extermination camps, but you knew that people were put to death. And th -- and this -- this came up in this film about Dachau for example, what people said, th-the residents said, well this was not -- this was not an extermination camp. Well the -- some of the first efforts of extermination were done in Dachau. And I -- I\u2019d -- I know there wasn\u2019t television and so forth, but th -- but people knew, people knew.

W-W-Why don\u2019t we do that? Why do we -- why don\u2019t we take action about values that are right and wrong instead of well, you know, you have to play the political game, and I -- I think I used to be a whole lot more optimistic than I am now, but I think when the whole Bosnian crisis broke, I just- | -- ] felt as if the bottom had g-gone out from under my stomach, and I just kind of felt -- w- w-we just aren\u2019t going anywhere.

You get the right manipulator out there doing the right PR stuff, and everybody loses everything that they supposedly claim is -- is what they believe. It\u2019s very hard. It\u2019s very hard to accept that. And -- and I think the -- I think when I first came here, of course, people asked me all kinds of questions. I was still a little kid when I came, I mean when ha -- when the war ended, of course, there was such a sense of -- a-again, what did I as a child know? It\u2019s very difficult to know. I knew that we were being liberated. I knew that freedom was once again back in Holland, and I knew what it meant for me. I knew that I could run in the street, I knew I could open the door, I knew I could talk in a regular voice. I knew that I could find friends to play with on the street, and I did. There was a child across the street who - whose father was also a baker, but an only child who was a year older than I, and we -- we neither of us knew about each other for -- for nearly three and a half years here. And -- and I went to school, and she and I walked to school, and I had that life that had been on hold, that I had been waiting for as a small child. And then about December, I got very sick. I had bronchitis, I had pneumonia, I had whooping cough. I had -- I\u2019ve forgotten, something else."

And I actually sat the -- the kids down and explained to them that they had been invited, and this is what Memorial Day was all about, and so forth and so on, and that I myself owed something to the American soldiers, but at -- at this particular time, this also meant something that I did not want to share, that I didn\u2019t believe in, and that I felt was wrong. And I wanted them to have two things out of that. One was, not a disrespect for Memorial Day, in fact, understanding that I owed my life to these men, and that I recognized that, and that I was very torn up about this dilemma. And I also wanted them to understand that if you believe that these values are important, then you have to do what this means for you, but you don\u2019t impose it on someone else.

And they put all the children -- I mean, we were the only two, as far as I know, who didn\u2019t belong to that French group, but there were hundreds of -- hundreds of children of all ages, and they put them all in the hold of this ship on these layers of canvas and gave every child a dirty blanket and said that you\u2019re a number so and so on the thing. And I didn\u2019t speak French, but every other child did, and my sister did and so on. And all I remember is seeing this big opening on -- big s -- huge square opening and seeing the sky from the hold of this ship, which had been originally a Greek troop sh -- a Greek freighter, which had been ta -- taken over and converted into a troop ship, and was now converted into a passenger liner. So the passengers, the other passengers were really all adults, and the kids were all in the hold. A-And I don\u2019t know if there was any other cargo.

And my sister, in the best of efforts, took me to the ship\u2019s dispensary, which had a Greek doctor, who was kind of -- I -- I don\u2019t know where his training was from, but what they did to me there was cupping. And I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard of or read about cupping, but cupping is taking something the equivalent of maybe a shot glass -- no, a little bigger, whatever, cocktail glass or something, and you create a vacuum in the glass by lighting a match into it, and you use up the air and the oxygen, and before you have a chance to fill that back in again, you press it down on the back. And they put rows and rows of these glasses on my back. And then, of course, because there\u2019s a -- a vacuum in the glass, the glass pulls the skin and everything with the skin into the glass. And then you yank these glasses off. So this provides -- what I decided the -- the reason for this was, to make you focus on some other pain, of such intensity that you forgot about what you really came for. But it probably came from the medieval notion that if you get the blood moving, that you could get the ill humors out, or something. And I was in huge pain, terrible pain, and I sat on a -- some -- some chair or other, some corner of the deck, swathed in blankets and the tears streaming down my face, for days. And the sa -- the -- the sailors kind of took pity on me, and they would bring me an occasional piece of fruit or so -- the food on this boat was all spoiled. The only thing that was edible was some of the fruit. I -- I didn\u2019t eat anything except the fruit that they brought. And meanwhile I wasn\u2019t getting any better, so I had to report back to the dispensary and they would do it again and again. And I cried so bitterly and pleaded with them to stop doing it, that they finally stopped doing it, but then they did something somewhat similar which is -- which is, if you can imagine plaster that is like an emery board on the other side, is like sandpaper. And they put this plaster on you with the sandpaper side towards the skin, and then they rip it off in rapid succession. So you have again, a similar thing going on, but it\u2019s just horrendously painful. At least it wasn\u2019t as bad as the cupping. So partway across the ocean, one of the engines dies, and then I became sort of aware of the fact there were all these adults on the boat, because then there was a lot of chaos, and a lot of crying, and a lot of people who were certain we were never going to make it, and I saw how upset these people were. And I don\u2019t think it registered on me what it meant that one of the motors died and you couldn\u2019t do anything. Well, we did make it over that ocean and we did get to New York, and when we arrived in New York there was a dock strike. So now we\u2019re on this boat, twirling around in the harbor day after day after day with this dock strike going on, and --"

So they took just the children off on -- on one of these sightseeing water boats, or several decker boat things. And ki -- when we came into Ellis Island and unloaded, and my aunt and uncle had both come to New York, but my uncle had had to go back, because of the dock strike, he couldn\u2019t take off from work so long. So we came into this enormous processing hall of some sort or other, and walked in there, and I remember my sister had her arm around me, and she was carrying whatever little baggage we had. And as we came in at either side of the -- this enormous doorway, were women standing with a stack of presents, and each child was given this beautifully wrapped box. Now, what\u2019s in this box?

It\u2019s impossible. I c -- I couldn't even begin to brainstorm ideas about anything. And the older I get, the more I understand it, and the more I admire here. She was not a complicated woman, she was not well educated. She, as I say, worked for my father in the bakery as a 0 salesgirl, and they must have somehow kept in touch because even when she was -- m-my sister did indicate that there was -- that they had kept in touch and so forth. I don\u2019t know if there was any socializing back and forth. But that\u2019s -- y-you know, I -- I -- why did she do this, did she do it because there was money to be had? I\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t an issue. Did she do it -- there may have well passed money, but I\u2019m sure this was not the reason. Did she do it for religious reasons? I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t remember them being very religious -- I mean, I remember -- I remember the neighbors after the war, I remember that the neighbors who ran the embroidery store next door were two -- two ladies who seemed -- who then seemed elderly to me, they probably weren\u2019t, and -- and they were very religious, and they asked if I would like to go to Catholic mass with them the following whatever, whatever, and -- and I was a child who really kept away from religion. Now why? It\u2019s not so easy to say. People make an easy assumption that it\u2019s because of my -- my experiences. I\u2019m not sure. Somehow these experiences are in a separate category. Whereas I was never a child who had great notions of -- of God and -- and so forth, I had -- religion made me uncomfortable, and I just wasn\u2019t very keen on it. But -- but I don\u2019t think that that was the motivating factor w-w-wh-why would she respond so differently than the other siblings with whom she was raised? So I think some of that had to do, perhaps, with the personal relationship that she had with my father. He had been very good to her, I understand, and maybe- m-maybe that\u2019s sort of what I always preach about, which is that when -- when people get to know each other, when people rub elbows together, when you see that -- that, you know, this person is not some stereotypic, stigmatized non -- untouchable kind of person -- I-I don\u2019t know, m-maybe she had a crush on my father when she was young. I -- I -- I have no idea why she did it. Did she do it as wi -- what you said earlier, that she perhaps wasn\u2019t wild about Jews, but this is a Jew she knew personally and she felt that she -- that he didn\u2019t deserve, and his family didn\u2019t 1 deserve this.

And apparently the -- these banks had hidden this stuff in the attics of some houses on the canals and so forth, in Amsterdam. And some bright-eyed journalist exposed this whole mess, which is how this payment came about, how this sort of blanket payment was made. But you know -- I mean, f-for some people it\u2019s too late, it\u2019s -- a payment was too late for my aunt. She died in \u201997, and I was in Vienna, and I learned when I was in Vienna that Austria, at some brief moment in time was shamed into making some kind of compensation, and that they -- it was so shamefully small, apparently, that there was a big -- I don\u2019t remember this, but a big hullabaloo about it. And they stopped this small payment, and then they started again, made it a little bit bigger. But they kept the time period within which you could apply for that so narrow, and that the announcing of this worldwide so closed, that nobody knew about it. I mean, here my aunt reads and talks German, and so forth, reads the papers. Her brother was -- came back from Russia to live in Vienna, they didn\u2019t know about it. I talked to my -- my aunt\u2019s sister-in-law, who is now in a home for the aged in Vienna, and I asked her if she knew anything about this and she said no. She doesn\u2019t know anything about this. And when I went to f -- inquire about this and so forth, they in -- practically didn\u2019t say anything, but immediately said to me, it\u2019s not for heirs, it\u2019s only for that person. Well -- or -- or persons. So they made it very clear that they weren't about to do anything. But the N\u201c degree of this is how do you repay anybody? How do you put a figure on what happened?"

And I got -- I made some friends, and most of the Jewish kids didn\u2019t live in our neighborhood, so any friendships I made were difficult to follow up on because they were in other parts of Rochester. And they themselves were members of the Conservative Temple in -- in Rochester, but they felt okay with me going to the Reformed synagogue, which was interesting. But when it came to the high holidays, they walked, and they celebrated them, and they wanted me to do likewise, and I was supposed to go to services with them, and walk to Temple, and not being a great lover of walking from the days I went through the alley at the -- at the wax museum, I always sort of resented that, and I thought that the whole idea was crazy and foolish and you know, it just seemed to me sort of -- and then of course I was out of school on those days, and I didn\u2019t like that, and I had to go back and explain why wasn\u2019t I in school. And those were not the days when you were given to be excused because it was religious absence and stuff, so that was always a pain. On the other hand, by the time I got to about the eighth grade, I had a very good teacher, and we had some real history, and the history of the Jewish people. And I ended up actually valuing that because I did learn something here, and because I always found myself in the position of being the only Jewish kid in a large gathering of non-Jews. And so I was always the spokesperson, a not particularly willing] -- willingly, but people put me there. So I would have to answer questions about what do Jews believe and -- and why did they kill Christ, and all these kinds of things. And it made me rather unhappy, but I felt better having had the 8 class, so that I could in fact answer some questions. And so actually I stayed on, and stayed in the Confirmation year, which was yet another year, and then I learn even more about what Jews believe and why they do what they do. And then I was Confirmed and I went on and stayed in -- I-I was -- I sang in the choir in the synagogue and then I stayed on and did two more years of what was called post-Confirmation class. And we did comparative religion, and we did study of the Torah and so forth, wi-with Rabbi Philip Bernstein who\u2019d been a -- a chapel -- chaplain at -- during the second war. And I think that there was a lot that I began to appreciate about what then became something more meaningful."

Wh-What -- what is there that\u2019s really worth fighting for here? And I think that that really was the sort of connecting thread to most of what I did all my life.

I thought only those people who had survived the camps, the people -- th-th-the -- the displaced persons, the people who had the numbers carved on their arms. I didn\u2019t have that, and I was alive, and I was -- I was with a family, and I guess I was hidden, but -- so -- and -- and I remember the first time, the very first time that I saw any movie that related to anything having to do with the war.

And if I\u2019m not willing to do that, then I\u2019m really doing a grave disservice, both to humankind and to those who died, because no one was there to speak for them if it\u2019s not coming from us. And the -- the dilemma about not only studying this whole human element to -- to realize -- well, I made mention for example of the -- of \u201cThe Eye of the Storm,\u201d or the -- the, \u201cBlue Eyes, Brown Eyes,\u201d and all of those. Yes, we can isolate those particular behaviors and we can call them by names and we can study them. Stanley Milgrim, a social psychologist at Yale did these studies that are probably more telling about what happened and why people and how people were able to do these terrible things. If you know the -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m sure you do, but he -- he basically put somebody in a white coat in a lab with a one way mirror, and he brought people in off the street, and said we\u2019re running this experiment. We\u2019re going to see how much pain these -- how much shock these subjects are willing to endure. And below the one way mirror was a group of actors in a studio. And there was a fake set of dials and people turned up the electricity. Up and up and up. And it didn\u2019t matter that the actors were writhing on the floor and screaming and calling and saying stop, stop. It apparently did not affect most of the people, not every single one. And now you couldn\u2019t do that kind of experiment any more because of the upset to the people who -- who came to recognize what they were capable of doing. But if we\u2019re capable of doing that, and we keep doing it, and we keep doing it, and we keep turning our backs to what\u2019s going on 1n areas where other people are doing it, we\u2019re not advancing at all. 4"

Maybe. I -- I think th -- I only -- I have to continue to believe that, because otherwise I can\u2019t continue to go on.

But the bottom line is that we should perhaps not be so adaptable. We should not be able to do what these Jews did for so long, throughout history, which 1s to adjust to the behavior that was imposed on them, and the restrictions imposed on them, and the tortures imposed on them. What can you do? You can\u2019t stand up and fight. I know that they -- they were helpless, they had no weapons, they had no allies, they had nothing. So the question about why didn\u2019t they stand up and fight becomes a -- a moot question, really. But when you find yourself in a situation where we really must stop, I don\u2019t know why we, as a nation, aren\u2019t in the streets, and I consider myself equally guilty, because I don\u2019t know what to do. But why are not in the street demanding that we stop killing? How far have we come if we can\u2019t sit around the table and try to work things out. Why can\u2019t we -- I took training in mediation. Much of my work has been in -- in law in education, and first amendment rights. And those liberties and freedoms that we have fought for in this country, since time immemorial as far as the history of this country, why are we suddenly making different rules for different people? I -- I don\u2019t know how to adjust to that, it -- 1t -- it\u2019s -- I think when people used to ask me, you know, do you wa -- well, how do you feel about this country and so forth, and I always had felt this 1s the country where people can talk, where people can argue, where you can have a 5 dialog, where we have an open press. And yet things keep coming out, and keep coming out and keep coming out. In the papers every day, in the -- the general news. I don\u2019t have access to any private news any more than anybody else. But finally it\u2019s getting to people in the streets that this president lied to us, and for whatever personal reasons went to war, killing not only Americans, but also Iraqis, or Afghanis, and the -- and the justification for af -- Afghanistan, I think, is certainly greater than Iraq. But there were no weapons of mass destruction. Why do we support a world organization? Why do we say other countries have to adhere to the decisions of the world organization, but we\u2019re outside the law. This doesn\u2019t make any sense. That doesn\u2019t move us forward. It doesn\u2019t put us in the situation of -- of making unacceptable certain ways of warfare and torture and behavior. We -- we ti -- we say Amnesty International is wrong. They come in -- the Red Cross is bamboozled, just as they were by the Nazis. The Nazis came into the camps, into some of those camps, and there is data that I have just seen this spring, actually, at Hoover, indicating what the men were told, what the soldiers were told, in order to dress up the camp so that the Red Cross could come in and be impressed. How they had casual music groups, how they had caf\u00e9s set up, they shipped half of the camp population off to another camp because they- the -- otherwise the Red Cross would say you have too many people per square bed, or whatever. Well, such as you might call it. It\u2019s unbelievable what these people did. And here, first person accounts that I am now finding in the original languages about what the Nazis did in order to bamboozle the Red Cross. But we are in similar situations, uncomfortably similar situations. And I can\u2019t live with this, I am finding this nightmarish. My daughter and I talk on the phone and we\u2019re either in tears, or we\u2019re so upset every phone call that I finally said to her, we've got to put this off limits, we can\u2019t do this. Ic -- I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t do this. But I am -- Iam just as bad as everybody else. I haven\u2019t done anything except signing petitions and trying to get 6 people to listen and read. But I haven\u2019t gone off in the street and demonstrated. I ha -- I don\u2019t know what to do. And of course this -- this public relations campaign about making every difference of opinion seem like an unpatriotic act has a very familiar ring to me. I heard this before. And there -- here we are celebrating 60 years til the end of the war. Where are we now? That was the war to end all wars. So it tastes very bad."

            "answer": "Mm-hm, mm-hm. No, there\u2019s -- there\u2019s no question about that, I -- I do think about that enormously. I -- I think all the ti -- and -- and also actually all the years that I was getting older and so forth, I kept thinking about what it must have been like for my mother -- when I was 45 or something. You know, I would think, oh my God, my mother was such and such and age, and this is what was happening, and what would I do, and so forth. And I was also -- and I think I had very strong, not only values, but ideas, and also at the same time, I think, wanted very much for my children to have as normal -- whatever that really means, but as normal a childhood as possible. And so I -- I know I\u2019m veering off your question a little bit, but I felt on the one hand that they needed to learn what I could express about this from a learning point of view. So we did very little by way of Jewish tradition in the home, partly because I didn\u2019t like the pulling apart of some members of the Jewish community and I didn\u2019t like the sort of exclusiveness that one particular rabbi had -- had communicated. So we didn\u2019t really want our kids exposed to that, so ours was by contrast a much more inclusive home, and there was -- it wa -- it\u2019s really interesting because I-Leas, my daughter has often said, you know, this community, or that community, or this group of people is -- is really the example of the kind of values that you and Dad taught us. And so clearly there was a -- a -- a very clear understanding of what those values were. And so we neither the kids likes this exclusiveness that some communities will -- will -- will send out, will radiate. And at the same time, I didn\u2019t want them to have the burden that so many children of survivors seem to carry. And I got to know about that, because as I was speaking around, so many of the people came to me and said, oh now I understand what my parents didn\u2019t want to 0 tell me, or now I understand why it\u2019s so difficult to talk about the second World War, or whatever, whatever, whatever. And likewise in Europe, where I\u2019ve spoken in a number of places, including Austria, to high school teachers, who said, we cannot speak to our parents, they will not answer questions, they will not tell us where they were, and so on, or what they did. And at the same time I see that this presents a special kind of burden, and I didn\u2019t want to have our kids have that. Now this commitment to normalcy, is that sort of -- that\u2019s probably not that unusual, I imagine any parent wants only the happiest and the best f-for their kids, and it\u2019s not always the happy situations that build character, necessarily, but at the same time I made sure that the kids had a sense of -- of inclusiveness, of one world ideas about respect for other people. So much so that the kids were actually quite -- took on an activist role in school on behalf of other kids. Not Jewish kids, necessarily, but I -- you know, speaking up on behalf of someone that the teacher was picking on. The teacher probably didn\u2019t even know he was doing it, and so on. And then also, I think, reflecting on the present role of Israel, vis-a-vis the Palestinians, taking classes in Israeli-Arab dispute. Trying to be informed and to not be afraid to express an opinion in opposition to the Israeli government. Sometimes putting themselves at -- on the outs with other Jews, perhaps. But I felt that that was terribly, terribly important. Now the same goes for putting yourself out for some of these people. And so far, I have not been able to do that in a personal sense -- back to your original question, other than in the monetary sense. And w-we have as a family, and as -- and my husband and I personally, have made big commitments to IRC, the International Rescue Committee, which seems in a major way to be helping refugees without any respect to what their country or their nationa -- their nationality or their religion 1s, but going to those places in the world where people are desperate, where people are suffering because of what\u2019s going on, whether it\u2019s internal or external strife, and so on. So we have done as much as 1 we could, maybe not as much as we can do, but still hope to be able to continue to do, in those terms, which -- which are important. And my husband, especially, I think in a professional way, has brought the plight of the refugees to students, involved students in the work that\u2019s necessary to save these people around the world. To do even small things, like volunteer to teach English as a second language in the local church or school, wherever the classes are being held. To -- one of -- one of -- wo -- actually she wasn\u2019t a student of mine at Hampshire, but a -- a na -- a student, who became a student of Peter\u2019s, and worked in the refugee camps and extended herself to the point of taking a small inheritance that she had from her grandmother, and bringing three Cambodian women back, who had been raped and tortured and so forth. And adopting them, bringing them back, getting them settled, getting them set up. Yeah, we\u2019re not saving the world, but we are trying, and -- and I think sometimes when I have this great urgent sense of why am I sitting here in a classroom, I think, well, somebody has to sit in the classroom and try to keep part of the mission going that -- that we have got to change, and how do we do that. And that not everybody can run in the field, and do the medical stuff, or do the actual whatever. And somehow I\u2019ve often felt that in my small way, given the values that I think I\u2019ve been able to communicate, even at the level of simply teaching teachers to have respect for the child, which sounds as if it should be nothing anyone would argue about. But if you watch clearly, you see that not every adult, and not every person who\u2019s teaching, has that respect for that child. Even if they are church-going and religion loving, and anti-abortion and so forth. Respect for that other life, and the fact that that life has a will and some sense and justification for some freedom is not there a -- often, in spite of the espousal of these other, so-called values. So I feel sometimes that maybe this is a rationalization, but it is something I do believe I could do, and I could do it quite well. And so I felt that to throw in the towel was not the right thing for me to do, at least at tho -- 2 in those years of my life. I would like very much to be out in the field now, and -- and now 1s probably not a good time, having since had cancer and so forth. And I have to say that when I was first diagnosed with the cancer, a friend of mine said, oh Hedy, you\u2019re a survivor, you\u2019re going to make it. And I have to say, although I understood perfectly where she was coming from, I quietly said to myself, why do I have to keep proving it all the time? But I -- I feel now somewhat medically compromised about going out in the field, but it is something that I thought about. I thought seriously about joining the Peace Corps after my kids were grown. And -- and I still remember the horrible, horrible feeling I had during the Kosovo time, and when there was talk about the draft and my son was draft age, and I thought to myself -- and I didn\u2019t say it out loud, but I just was devastated with the thought that I lost the family behind me, and now I was going to lose the family in front of me. It was something I could barely confront myself. And now I\u2019m looking at my grandson. And if this continues, he will be draft age. Jordy and Robert are the two sons of my son. And I-I just -- I can\u2019t face that. I just can\u2019t face that. I just can\u2019t face that."
