My fa \u0152 my family was not very religious, and neither was my mother\u2122s family very religious, although my mom\u2122s father, my grandfather which I never knew, everybody talked of him being as a religious person. M-My \u0152 my \u0152 the Hollenbergs, my \u0152 my father\u2122s two sisters were not too religious. So we\u2122d go to synagogue and I\u2122d go with my father and brother, and my father would take us to synagogue to keep us Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 6 November 1, 2009 out of the house so my mom would have free time.

But my father had to report m-more precisely how many \u0152 how much grain wi \u0152 came in, or how much potatoes, that was important. And by the summer or spring of next year, my father, I remember him worrying that if we had too much land, would they think us being rich, and would we have to be shipped away?

As a matter of fact, one of my mother\u2122s brutha \u0152 brothers, which h-he is in the photograph, he served on the police force as a consultant for awh ile. So, that never happened before.

            "answer": "No, it wa \u0152 first of all, it was fear, not just for the baby\u2122s survival, but for the adults\u2122 survival, what would happen with a pogrom, with the killings, that we have to go into hiding. So we already knew that he might not sur \u0152 I mean, we knew that we were all in major danger, so I think, now that you mention it, that was probably one of the reason that we moved from building numb er one to building number two, because Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 25 October 8, 2010 there was a little bit more liberty, or people didn\u2122t say we won\u2122t allow the baby in the \u0152 in the bunker. Because every building had a bunker, and in building number one, the bunker was between the two houses, so it was a wall was walled off, and we\u2122d crawl into a s \u0152 into a small place to get into th \u0152 this wall. And in building number two, the one that we moved, the bunker was in the cellar. So when the killing began, everybody went into the \u0152 to the building, that was during the Purim massacre, and \u0152 and they didn\u2122t allow the baby to come in with us. He was, by then, four or five weeks old, he was still tiny. And you know \u0152 and I know he was tiny in \u0152 in the recollection of what he did, he was just lying th ere, he cou \u0152 you know, he couldn\u2122t even smile yet. So he was very tiny. And so we all went into \u0152 into the bunker in the cellar, and we couldn\u2122t bring the baby, so we left the baby on a big bed, surrounded w ith pillows. And my mom was crying and they ke pt holding her down. And we stayed there, I don\u2122t remember how long, but we stayed there til it was almost dark, you know, from the morning. And when we got upstairs we found the baby dead. But not just this, the baby\u2122s cries were so loud, that the baby jeopardized the people next door, who were hiding in that compartment in between the walls, between one wall and another. So here were the people, here were the two \u0152 you know, and the cry from this bed \u0152 from this room to the \u0152 the police, it \u0152 this was not \u0152 this massacre wasn\u2122t a German massacre, it was the Ukraine police and the German and the Poles that did it. So it Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 26 October 8, 2010 wasn\u2122t primarily the German Gestapo like when they cleaned out Korol\u00f3wka, like in the first pogrom.

I \u0152 I might be confusing a little bit because of such a long time, whether it was just at the Purim massacre, or the \u0152 or the \u0152 or \u0152 or the one just before Passover, where they lined up hundreds, everybody in Borschev and they shot them in the big grave. And again, this wasn\u2122t just a German \u0152 a German there with the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the Ukraine police with their shooting. And that grave, it\u2122s still there, but what I recollect , maybe that\u2122s a childhood memory, was that the grave itself was very long. It was about \u0152 longer than this house, which is this \u0152 I don\u2122t know how long. Well, anyways, it was almost a half a block long. And when I went to market pe \u0152 the \u0152 the peasants were talking about the grave, how it was bubbling and the \u0152 and the blood was just goi ng up and down, bluh, bluh, bluh. So I went to the grave, and wanted to see it, to the Jewish cemetery and wanted to see the grave itself. And sure enough, it wasn\u2122t as strong as the first day, but still, you can see the heave of the grave, kind of, just the moving of the grave. And \u0152 and I let it be, and there \u0152 one of the Sturmers (ph) \u0152 the people, the wife of Mr. Sturmer(ph), her name was Chana(ph), she said to me, she says, I just want you to remember that I saw you in a blue coat, walking around, and I sa w where you were coming from, which means Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 28 October 8, 2010 the direction of the cemetery. So, do you know, I always thought that that was just a memory kind of thing that I remembered kind of, and wouldn\u2122t say it til anybody til 50 - 60 years later, Chana(ph) Sturmer (ph) affirmed my memory. So, I don\u2122t mean I was happy, but it was like the memories were really memories, because I didn\u2122t talk much about the Holocaust or anything like that, it was just like it was unshared. It was something that I knew, and it was mine. A nd to have somebody say, I saw from where \u0152 you know, in this blue coat, and all of a sudden, I remember the blue coat, and it was unbelievable.

She was, I think must have been a so cial worker. She was just so nice, she talked so polite. And I wasn't sure of my birth date, and my birth \u0152 and I \u0152 I know I was born in March, but I wasn\u2122t sure. She said, and what month would you like? And I loved my little brother, and he was born in May. So I said, I think I was born in March, but I love May, because the way I held on to my family is remembering things about Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 42 October 8, 2010 them, not as much about me. So, if I remember all those little things about them, they were never \u0152 they never died , you know. So she said, oh, May is a lovely month, how about May? So we put down May 28 th, but I\u2122m not totally sure of my birth date. We have a \u0152 and one of the reasons too, I went ba ck in \u0152 in July of 209, is another person told me they went back and they found their birth date in the school records, and I went for one year to school. I said, oh, I must go back and see if they have the record. And of course, that wasn\u2122t true."

Oh, I want to say \u0152 anyways, it was a \u0152 an orphagenage , and then the Jewish Family and Children Service asked the kids where they want \u0152 some of them had relatives in New York , some of the \u0152 and, of course, every \u0152 I wanted to stay in New York. And the reason was, in case anything happened, I could take a boat right back. So, there was this lady, another very nice person, and said, well, where would you like to go? There\u2122s a pl \u0152 Jewish Family and Children right now, Chicago or Boston. And so I said, well, is Boston on the coast, you know. Yes, it is. So I went to Boston, and the Jewish and Family and Children\u2122s Service took me in, and they found adoptive families for me, and they found very nice families and they wanted to adopt me so badly. There was a Mrs. Wachs(ph) and Morris Wachs(ph), Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 43 October 8, 2010 he was a soldier in \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 in Germany. And \u0152 and they were so nice, they had no children. And I just couldn\u2122t be adopted, be cause you see, I had all those birthdays and all those little things in my heart, that I didn't tell anybody. And so I couldn\u2122t be adopted. S-So I remember one time, it was another nice family that I don\u2122t know, they di \u0152 I don\u2122t think they wanted to adopt me, but anyways, I sort of ran away from them an-and ended up at the harbor when the agency found me. So they found a \u0152 a \u0152 a very nice overnight school for ma \u0152 for me, called the Windsor Mountain School in Lenox, and it\u2122s a high school. And I went there, a nd it was the most marvelous, beautiful place for me, because I was among kids who were ki ds in this school, and I didn\u2122t have to give loyalty to somebody that \u0152 that wasn\u2122t mine. Do y \u0152 do you understand? I didn't have to love anybody except from sheer goodwill. So I was in this beautiful school that saved my soul. You know, maybe coming to the United States saved my life, but that school saved my soul. And also, what I disc overed is books and re ading. And so, after I graduate, I applied for scholarships, got scholarships. Oh, the first year, I was with the Jewish Family Servi \u0152 there was a social worker named Edith Costa, and she took us to Revere beach, around here, and we had an accident, and I broke my nose because I was sitting on somebody\u2122s lap. And bingo, like this, and so I got 500 dollars for the broken nose. So when I graduated high school, I applied for a scholarship and I had 500 dollars, that paid fo r room and board, and I got scholarship. And then, when I Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 44 October 8, 2010 graduated from \u0152 with my belach \u0152 bachelor\u2122s, I applied to the VA and got a scholarship to go to school of social work."

That if I share those truths with somebody else, then that might be taken away, too. And it was a peculiar kind of thinking. And I\u2122ve been Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 45 October 8, 2010 sort of reading more about it, and \u0152 and the kids, my own children, who run from 50 to 40 now, really are telling me now how they wondered why they didn\u2122t have a grandmother and why I never talked about it. And my husband too. And \u0152 and my husband in particular felt that he wa \u0152 I was who I was, he didn\u2122t need \u0152 he knew enough to know, but I did-didn\u2122t have to ta lk about it, and the same thing his family. His ma \u0152 his mom, that I lik e very much, my mother-in-law said, don\u2122t \u0152 don\u2122t hurt her any more. So, it was really \u0152 the thing that I think needs to be shared is not that I want to forget them, but I just need to say it.
