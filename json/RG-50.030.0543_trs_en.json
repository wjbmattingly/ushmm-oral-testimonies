            "answer": "Well, I remember my parents as extremely loving. My father had a big farm. We had lots of land, and we actually were quite well off. My mom family lived down the street from us, the Rosenstocks(ph) and my grandma had a restaurant bar kind of thing. And her place, and her house was just across from the marketplace. So \u2014 the Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 5 November 1, 2009 marketplace where they sold horses and cattle, so I remember going there on Thursday and early, very early Thursday morning, my grandma would come \u2014 she \u2014 to our house. And I remember her brown buns hair in the back. And she would say, okay children, it\u2019s time to get dressed. And she was just the most loving person. My mom, she was one of six children, I think, maybe five. She had a older sister. She had three younger brothers. I think she was one of six, maybe five. And \u2014 and again I remember one of my mother\u2019s brother, when it was my first day of school he came by my house, and I had a white bow on my head, he made \u2014 wanted to make sure that I look my best, and \u2014 and I was sent off to school. But it was always, you know those memories a-are so vivid, and so important to me, that sort of \u2014 but it was sort of secret-like. It kept me alive for so long."

            "answer": "Well, we \u2014 w-we \u2014 1n Korol\u00e9wka, there were houses a-along streets, the streets were unpaved. And the town, the center of town was all Jewish, and there were synagogues. My fa \u2014 my family was not very religious, and neither was my mother\u2019s family very religious, although my mom\u2019s father, my grandfather which I never knew, everybody talked of him being as a religious person. M-My \u2014 my \u2014 the Hollenbergs, my \u2014 my father\u2019s two sisters were not too religious. So we\u2019d go to synagogue and I\u2019d go with my father and brother, and my father would take us to synagogue to keep us Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 6 November 1, 2009 out of the house so my mom would have free time. But \u2014 and \u2014 and he loved the studying of Judaism, as a studying, as \u2014 as a point of discussion. And I remember very high falutin\u2019 discussion, and very serious because I remember the voices going up and down. But in the sense of devout, on the sense of \u2014 we were not. But again, 1-1n the morning, he would say his prayers with the tallis and the \u2014 oh, whatever. And so in one sense we were Jewi \u2014 because we were Jewish my father said that it was important for all of us to know ar \u2014 and understand who we were. And I remember my younger brother would go to chayder, I didn\u2019t go to chayder, I had a private tutor at home. And my father would talk about the stories in the Bible with my brother and I would pipe in and tell the stories before my brother, and \u2014 and my father would say, now who am I talking to here? So, it w \u2014 it was just a very loving family."

And my father would spend an awful lot of time at his sister\u2019s house, and my mom would say, you\u2019re never here. But, because we had a lot of land and a big farm, we dealt with the Ukraine more than the Polish people on a daily basis, but 1t was more in terms of labor and work being done than coming to a house and having coffee, nobody did that."

            "answer": "Well, when the Soviets came, the first year went according usual. But my father had to report m-more precisely how many \u2014 how much grain wi \u2014 came in, or how much potatoes, that was important. And by the summer or spring of next year, my father, I remember him worrying that if we had too much land, would they think us being rich, and would we have to be shipped away? So I remember already him worrying what will happen if the Soviets would stay \u2014 would have stayed, because the imposition and the taxes or the contribution of grain to the Soviet Union was quite different than before, and he couldn\u2019t hire the \u2014 as many people as he did before.

I don\u2019t know what to be fearful, I couldn\u2019t tell you specifically, but it felt that the police was more on the Jewish side. As a matter of fact, one of my mother\u2019s brutha \u2014 brothers, which h-he is in the photograph, he served on the police force as a consultant for awhile. So, that never happened before. No Jew would ever s- serve in government or a thing like that before the war. And one of my cousins \u2014 well, that was maybe before the war, he tested so high in school that they were going to send him to a high school in Borschev and that never happened in Korolowka before, that a Jewish boy would go to a Polish high school."

But what happened, the Jewish community would get papers, a month or two months old, from Lvov or Krakow, or sometimes even from the United States, and that\u2019s how they sort of got their news. The best news, if anybody got the London paper, or the other English, or other foreign papers, which could have been six months old, I don\u2019t know, but it was old papers, you know, that we got the news.

And I was watching them walk through, you see, so just marching, and everybody was happy and laughing. But everybody in town knew that something terrible was going to happen, because a few months before, there were a lot of people from Silesia running to the Russian borders, and wa \u2014 and that was even before the war, before 1941, and there were some people that stayed with us in our house, because any \u2014 you have to offer hospitality to any strangers that c-come through the town.

            "answer": "No, it wa \u2014 first of all, it was fear, not just for the baby\u2019s survival, but for the adults\u2019 survival, what would happen with a pogrom, with the killings, that we have to go into hiding. So we already knew that he might not sur \u2014 I mean, we knew that we were all in major danger, so I think, now that you mention it, that was probably one of the reason that we moved from building number one to building number two, because Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 25 October 8, 2010 there was a little bit more liberty, or people didn\u2019t say we won\u2019t allow the baby in the \u2014 in the bunker. Because every building had a bunker, and in building number one, the bunker was between the two houses, so it was a wall was walled off, and we\u2019d crawl into a s \u2014 into a small place to get into th \u2014 this wall. And in building number two, the one that we moved, the bunker was in the cellar. So when the killing began, everybody went into the \u2014 to the building, that was during the Purim massacre, and \u2014 and they didn\u2019t allow the baby to come in with us. He was, by then, four or five weeks old, he was still tiny. And you know \u2014 and I know he was tiny in \u2014 in the recollection of what he did, he was just lying there, he cou \u2014 you know, he couldn\u2019t even smile yet. So he was very tiny. And so we all went into \u2014 into the bunker in the cellar, and we couldn\u2019t bring the baby, so we left the baby on a big bed, surrounded with pillows. And my mom was crying and they kept holding her down. And we stayed there, I don\u2019t remember how long, but we stayed there til it was almost dark, you know, from the morning. And when we got upstairs we found the baby dead. But not just this, the baby\u2019s cries were so loud, that the baby jeopardized the people next door, who were hiding in that compartment in between the walls, between one wall and another. So here were the people, here were the two \u2014 you know, and the cry from this bed \u2014 from this room to the \u2014 the police, it \u2014 this was not \u2014 this massacre wasn\u2019t a German massacre, it was the Ukraine police and the German and the Poles that did it. So it Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 26 October 8, 2010 wasn\u2019t primarily the German Gestapo like when they cleaned out Korolowka, like in the first pogrom.

It was about \u2014 longer than this house, which is this \u2014 I don\u2019t know how long. Well, anyways, it was almost a half a block long. And when I went to market pe \u2014 the \u2014 the peasants were talking about the grave, how it was bubbling and the \u2014 and the blood was just going up and down, bluh, bluh, bluh. So I went to the grave, and wanted to see it, to the Jewish cemetery and wanted to see the grave itself. And sure enough, it wasn\u2019t as strong as the first day, but still, you can see the heave of the grave, kind of, just the moving of the grave. And \u2014 and I let it be, and there \u2014 one of the Sturmers(ph) \u2014 the people, the wife of Mr. Sturmer(ph), her name was Chana(ph), she said to me, she says, I just want you to remember that I saw you in a blue coat, walking around, and I saw where you were coming from, which means Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 28 October 8, 2010 the direction of the cemetery. So, do you know, I always thought that that was just a memory kind of thing that I remembered kind of, and wouldn\u2019t say it til anybody til 50 60 years later, Chana(ph) Sturmer(ph) affirmed my memory. So, I don\u2019t mean I was happy, but it was like the memories were really memories, because I didn\u2019t talk much about the Holocaust or anything like that, 1t was just like 1t was unshared. It was something that I knew, and it was mine. And to have somebody say, I saw from where \u2014 you know, in this blue coat, and all of a sudden, I remember the blue coat, and it was unbelievable. But after that big massacre, there were not that many Jews left in the Borschev ghetto."

Although Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 40 October 8, 2010 I know that my father and brother are dead, somehow, because I didn\u2019t see it, they were not dead. So, it was a word, and it didn\u2019t apply to me at all. As a matter of fact, through the whole 60 some years since \u201965 \u2014 eight years, I still have the fantasy that my mother is alive, waiting for me. And my granddaughter, who is eight years old, who 1s about that, you know, 10 years old, and I was saying to my son and his family, I said, gee, I\u2019m really afraid to go back. And my granddaughter Meagan said, but what if your mother stands in front of the door and is waiting for you? And that was the same fantasy that I had. She didn't tell me anything new, and that\u2019s exa \u2014 exactly how I feel, that she 1s still, you know. So, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m [indecipherable] teach on that, from grandmother to granddaughter, or whatever. But that was \u2014 and also when I think of home, I don\u2019t think of myself as a 78 year \u2014 78 year old woman, I think of myself as 10 and 11 and 14 and 15 years old."

And I loved my little brother, and he was born in May. So I said, I think I was born in March, but I love May, because the way I held on to my family is remembering things about Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 42 October 8, 2010 them, not as much about me. So, if I remember all those little things about them, they were never \u2014 they never died, you know. So she said, oh, May 1s a lovely month, how about May?

Oh, I want to say \u2014 anyways, it was a \u2014 an orphagenage, and then the Jewish Family and Children Service asked the kids where they want \u2014 some of them had relatives in New York, some of the \u2014 and, of course, every \u2014 I wanted to stay in New York. And the reason was, in case anything happened, I could take a boat right back. So, there was this lady, another very nice person, and said, well, where would you like to go? There\u2019s a pl \u2014 Jewish Family and Children right now, Chicago or Boston. And so I said, well, is Boston on the coast, you know. Yes, it is. So I went to Boston, and the Jewish and Family and Children\u2019s Service took me in, and they found adoptive families for me, and they found very nice families and they wanted to adopt me so badly. There was a Mrs. Wachs(ph) and Morris Wachs(ph), Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 43 October 8, 2010 he was a soldier in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in Germany. And \u2014 and they were so nice, they had no children. And I just couldn\u2019t be adopted, because you see, I had all those birthdays and all those little things in my heart, that I didn't tell anybody. And so I couldn\u2019t be adopted. S-So I remember one time, it was another nice family that I don\u2019t know, they di \u2014 I don\u2019t think they wanted to adopt me, but anyways, I sort of ran away from them an-and ended up at the harbor when the agency found me. So they found a \u2014 a \u2014a very nice overnight school for ma \u2014 for me, called the Windsor Mountain School in Lenox, and it\u2019s a high school. And I went there, and it was the most marvelous, beautiful place for me, because I was among kids who were kids in this school, and I didn\u2019t have to give loyalty to somebody that \u2014 that wasn\u2019t mine. Do y \u2014 do you understand? I didn't have to love anybody except from sheer goodwill. So I was in this beautiful school that saved my soul. You know, maybe coming to the United States saved my life, but that school saved my soul. And also, what I discovered is books and reading. And so, after I graduate, I applied for scholarships, got scholarships. Oh, the first year, I was with the Jewish Family Servi \u2014 there was a social worker named Edith Costa, and she took us to Revere beach, around here, and we had an accident, and I broke my nose because I was sitting on somebody\u2019s lap. And bingo, like this, and so I got 500 dollars for the broken nose. So when I graduated high school, I applied for a scholarship and I had 500 dollars, that paid for room and board, and I got scholarship. And then, when I Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 44 October 8, 2010 graduated from \u2014 with my belach \u2014 bachelor\u2019s, I applied to the VA and got a scholarship to go to school of social work."
