            "answer": "My father was, my father\u2122s name is Lajos Holczer. He comes from a very poor working class family, a Jewish family that was almost totally assimilated into the Proletarian environment. They lived on the outskirts of Budapest in a tenement without any wa ter and electricity. My grandmother was practically the sole supporter of the family until th e children got a little bit older because my grandfather was a, what you would call a lumpen proletary (ph) person who did not really care too much about father responsi bilities. The, so my father was the oldest one who made it into adult life, there was somebody else ahead of him but died of tuberculosis. And he has always been a great support to his brothers and sisters. He was a wo rking man, he has always worked for other people. Eventually, he became kind of a, an amateur druggist, worked for companies but he did not have a formal education and after the war, he joined a co-op. He rose to kind of a mid-level managerial position but he basically was alwa ys just a working man. He neve r went beyond the second grade and he taught himself how to read and write and everything else. He had exceptional qualities in math and law. My mother 1 comes from a small nort hern Hungarian town, Vacz . This is where the Danube turns suddenly south and she comes from a middle class fa mily, Orthodox, very religious. She had a brother and a sister, both of them who died in World War II. The sister was deported, the brother died in labor camp. Her entire family fro m Vacz were, was deported to Auschwitz and died there. My mother never had to work, basically, my father was always making enough money and she enjoyed just being a housewife. Anything else?"

So, the burden of supp orting the family was always on him. So he was the provider ty pe and my mother had no basic re sponsibility. She was basically what you would call a petit-bourgeois lady and I always admired my father\u2122s values more than my mother\u2122s but that doesn\u2122t mean I di dn\u2122t love my mother. My mother also survived the war with me."

            "answer": "My father and mother met, so that, my father was working for a wholesal e drug distribution firm. By drug I, we mean a cosmetic supply firm, but in Hungary they were called druggists, making cologne water, things like that. It had nothing to do with what we call drugs today. It was not a pharmaceutical company. And my, at that time, in Hungary and in Europe, it was the custom of middle-class families to send their daughters to secretarial school and then have them work for a few years for some firm, hoping that they\u2122re going to catch a husband. And my mother caught my father there, which was very much to the dislike of he r family becaus e my father, they felt, was much below their class and they made him feel that way in all his life. Of course, I cannot really say what would have happened af ter World War II because my moth er\u2122s entire family was wiped out, practically. Only a few people who lived in Budapest remained. So, but I resented them for a very simple reason, that they lo oked down on my father who I thought wa s a, was a very, was a man of integrity and, and hard-w orking, a good human being."

I also resented the fact that my grandmother was kind of a, of a, of a very angry person. I felt that, that the way she treated others and the way she treated my grandfather, I resented that. I didn\u2122t like to go there and my mother, of course, always wanted me to go and visit and I have, I just finally decided to take my revenge so I would not have to visit anymore. And one day, th is was, I must have been about eleven or so, I went to a butcher shop, got a huge ham hock and got out and when the people went to the synagogue Friday night, I was eating it without a hat and pretty soon they were repo rting it to her and they were coming and that was my last visit. They immediately sent me back to Budapest and I neve r had to visit again."

Even when he scol ded me for something that, that had something to do with religion to go along with my moth er, I sensed in his voice that it was not serious, that he just did it for my mother\u2122s sake. And I also found out since, between 1948 and 195 0, I went to Israel , I was in Israel which we will come back later, when I came back and I spoke Hebrew, I realize that my father doesn\u2122t know how to pray, that he just mumbles the words. He has no id ea, what really, how to even pronounce them an d he did this all for, fo r the love of my, my, my mother and I appreciated this, that he put up this pretense but it was an interesting discovery for me, that. So he never, he never really scolded me and he was practically influe ntial after the war to put down his foot and say, forget about kosher anymore, let\u2122s just eat what is available. And so we did not have a kosher household anymore."

And interestingly, quite a few of them survived because of the place where they lived. Since they lived in a Proletarian tenement of\u0160city tenement\u0160that was given to people under a cert ain income who had too many children and not enough income, there, the Communis t Party, the illegal Communist Party had a very strong hold on this area and when, then, the World War II came and the Nuremburg laws and everything else, some of these Communist leaders, Communist members, came and actually re scued members of the family. I have an uncle in Hungary and he, fo r example, was a very good friend of a past Communist prime minister who just died recently because they practi cally lived side by side. So a great deal of the Hungarian leader ship, Communist leadership, came from this tenement. So that helped rescue them. The Communists were the only, the only group you could really turn to, during those terrible years that, that would help you."

He just asked me to respect my mother\u2122s wishes and so I had Bar Mitzvah and that was the last thing that I did. After my Bar Mitzvah I never probably went to synagogue again unless it was a tourist attraction, I just, wanted to see what it is, inside.

But I can\u2122t rememb er when I really honestly believed in a supreme being. And then of course, the war probably wipe d out, if I had any doubts."

I [indecipherable] , I considered him always my, my example, my her o, and I was very very upset when in 1942, he was taken away and sent to a labor camp in Yugoslavia. And when he came back in 194 5, he, of course, I was overwhelmed and in my memory too, even though I spent more time with my mother, a lot more than with my father because he was also a traveling salesman for a long time and I only saw him on weekends, somehow my memory is much more blurred when it comes to my mother than when it comes to my father. My mother, one reason it might be that my mother died in 1970 and my father died in 1980, so he survived ten more years and since we lived in Europe from \u212274 on, at least for six years I had a lot more contact with him than I would have if I had stayed in the U. S. I always considered him an absolute statue of integrity and, and honesty and he was always lo oking out for my interests and I, even though when I as an American, had a very nice living, I made a very nice living and I didn\u2122t need any, any material, he was still saving and collecting things for us in Hungary and was always 4 giving us a lot of things when we went to visit him and we kept telling him that he should spend it on himself.

And with my mother, I always had a little bit of my doubts that she\u2122s not as straightforw ard as my father. And th ere were little incidents that kind of, as a child, it\u2122s amazi ng how it gets engraved in your mind and you can not get rid of it. And the thing that I was very, very bitter about, that I could never fo rgive my mother for, was that while my father was in concentration camp in Yugoslavia, she took a little job and she worked for a drugstore in the center of Budapest. And next to the drugstor e was an antique store. Mr. Klein was the name of the man who owned and he liked my mother. My mother was a cute little creature and everybody liked her and so he would wait for her wh en she closed this shop to escort her home because he lived the same way and I didn\u2122t see a nything wrong with this, but they noticed how jealous I am of my mother and it\u2122s not that I wanted to posses s my mother, I just, I was protecting my mother for my father and so he put his arm around my mother and they were looking at me and laughing at how annoyed I became and this picture is constantly in my mind. And I could never forgive my mother for this, that, that she did not realize how hurt I was by playing this silly game. And she was, still she was a good person, she did everything possible to give me a good education and, but, she had a very petit-bourgeois thinking and another thing that somehow stood between the two of us was piano. She decided that I\u2122m going to be a great piano player and I decided that I have no interest in playing the piano an d she would sometimes get so annoyed that I did not practice that she would take a rug-beater and r un after me and try to beat me but I was much faster than she was so we were running around the table and then eventually she just broke down and cried that she couldn\u2122t catch me but she had this obsession with, with, with piano pl aying and so again, ever since in World War II, our piano was destroyed. We gave it to somebody for safekeeping and they claimed that the, the bomb got it, whatever, I was glad. She wanted to buy another piano and I said no. When I, when we came up from the cellar afte r liberation, I said, that\u2122s it. I am now a man. I basically rescued my mother more than once during World War II a nd I said no more piano and I never sat down to play the piano. Never. I never had the urge."

And I remember going out and loving every moment of spending time with them beca use here I came, I was the, the, the second grandchild in the family. There was one older one who, unfortunately, during the war, was killed. So I was kind of the sweetheart of everybody and they were pamperin g me and taking me to places and my grandmother, I remember, had a tremendous knowledge of how to ma ke beans in at least fifteen different ways. There were beans every time I went out, th ey had beans, beans, but she was just a marvelous woman, a very warm-hearted, a typical country woman. She came from southern Hungary from a very small village and after raising thirteen children during the day, she left them in the care of my father and then went from door to door selling silk st ockings just to add a little bit to the, to the income. The, my father\u2122s brothers and sisters were, of course, some of th em are only just 5 a few years older than I am , so they were almost like brothers and sisters to me at that time and since there was no money at all in the family, they resorted to somehow, illegal things. I remember I loved ice skating and they said, oh no problem and they took a huge scisso r\u0160pair of scissors\u0160and cut a big hole and pushed me thro ugh the hole into the ice skating rink, nearby, so we always went ice skating. A lot of things were solved not by very lega l ways, but as a child, this was life to me. There were a lot of children in the tenement constantly horsing around and nobody, nobody was constantly bothering me and, and, and disciplining me and get ting ahead or going to the synagogue, nothing.

And I cannot really say that one or the other, I liked one particularly and interestingly, I spent the least time with him. He was a, just kind of a very outstanding figure, a tall, very mascular [sic] man who went to Czechoslovakia during th e War, World War II and somehow worked for a shoe factory, which was a very famous shoe factor y all over the world, Ba ta, got married there and came once to visit us and I stil l remember his visit. I was so impressed with him, with his, there was just an air about this man that impressed me a great deal and, unfortunat ely, when there was the big uprising, there was a big Slov akian uprising against the Germans in 1944, and he was an officer in the, in this uprising, in the Partisan Army, and they caught him and he was hanged. So, we knew this for sure because his wife surv ived the war, he was a Gentile and he has two children living in Switzerland today. One, I\u2122m sorry, one, the other one is a stepbrother. He has one and I met him and so I knew the story. But, th is, this was the man who, to me, was an outstanding representative of my father\u2122s side of family. But, today, ther e are only two men and one wo men [sic.] left of the thirteen.

And we were comparing our bicycles. Bicycles were the same as cars today for us. I mean, it was, it was a thing and we admired the one who had the custom-made one or had just even custom-made parts, and so we had big races on bicycle and then that was it, so I was heartbroken when in 194 4, one of the first things we had to take in when the Germans occupied Hungary was the bicycle and the radio. And I lost it. I also belonged to an undergrou nd Boy Scout group, I was an avid u nderground Boy Scout. Th e reason I say underground because we couldn\u2122t be legal Boy Scouts. The Boy Scout movement, which was based on br otherhood and equality of all, declared that Jews are not equal and therefore all Jewish Boy Scout organizations were disbanded and Jews were also thrown out of those Boy Scout groups that we re not affiliated with 6 some Jewish school or something. I belonged to the so-called Three-Hu ndred Ten, number ThreeHundred Ten Jokay M\u00f3r Boy Scout group. Jokay M\u00f3r was a famous Hungarian writer, a humanist. He was not Jewish but he was a humanist. And we met illegally, sometimes in th e basement of synagogues and then we had to split up later into smaller groups and it was in, in homes, in one, the small groups consisted of about te n, between ten and fourteen people and so we just rotated and did all kinds of things, besides hiking, we were build ing model airplanes and di d what, what Boy Scouts usually do, otherwise. I have always, always dr eamt these days, I had alwa ys dreamt about one day having a uniform. The uniform was unbelievably importa nt for me, like most ki ds of my age at that time. And I was always dreaming about it and at sc hool, I just looked at my classmates who were, of course, Christians and could wear the uniform a nd just, I dreamt about that one day, I\u2122m going to have a uniform and the sad thing is that after th e war, when we met for the first time, those who survived in our group, and we went to get the uniform and we put it on and all of a sudden, to most of us, it didn\u2122t mean anything anymore. We were, it\u2122s hard to say, either we were too old or too cynical by that time to really attach any impo rtance to the uniform, so I never wore it again."

There\u2122s one incident in my middle school that I felt had ve ry, very important consequences for the rest of my life. We were, as basically innocents abroad, to the point where I really didn\u2122t pay much attention to being Jewish or not Jewish until this incident happened. In fifth grade, it was an art class and my art teacher was drawing something on the black board and we had to copy it, exactly. And then color it exactly.

The, teacher came around and made sure that everybody\u2122s following his instructio ns and just to emphasize that he mean s business, he had a big cane in his hand and for some reason, I missed a coup le of the colors and used something different. He became absolutely just, angry, unr easonably so and started to beat me to the point where I began to bleed through my nose. And I also became frantic seeing the blood coming from, from my nose 7 and all this so I ran home. I mentioned before that I lived next to the school. The other house was where we lived, apartment house. And I ran up to my mother\u2122s, into my mother\u2122s arms and asked her to clean me up and come and ba sically what I wanted is justice, I could not, even at the age of eleven, I couldn\u2122t believe that this is going to be the way it is. And I wanted her to come in and do something about it. And after she cleaned me up she said, \ufb01Now you mu st understand, a lot of things that you cannot u nderstand now, I cannot go in and do anything, ye s, except apologize for your behavior.\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01What, what behavi or, what did I do, used the wrong color,\ufb02 and she said, \ufb01Well, you don\u2122t understand just now.\ufb02 [Clocks chiming] And the reason, what I left out was a very important thing. The teacher was yelling at me as I was running out of the class, \ufb01I hope you go to Palestine to sell oranges. That\u2122s where you belong.\ufb02 And so when I to ld my mother, this is when her reaction came. So she came back to sch ool with me and instead of demanding some kind of a remedial action for this, apologized to the teac her. And I thought that was, that was a very strange thing. I didn\u2122t understand at that time. I did understand it, years later, that this was the only course she could, she could take. Obviously, she was afraid that maybe they will kick me out of school if she does someth ing else. And every Jewish family, of course, wanted to have their son finish middle school. And that incident somehow frustrated me to the point, it created a mental block. I never drew or never painted in my life since. I am such idiot when it comes to, to do anything with my hands that involves drawing or pa inting that it is pathetic. When we play some games, for example, with my friends, when I have to draw something, they can\u2122t believe that, they think my perception is that of a mentally retarded person and it is , it is just a, just a block. However, I appreciate art very much. I neve r fail to go and see an exhibit of paintings and drawings. I just don\u2122t want to do it and I cannot do it myself.

And, actua lly, the book was preparing you that one day we will get even. And what he was, among other things, he was teaching this subject, and he said, \ufb01Put the book away and let me tell you what life is about.\ufb02 And it was a very, very human, humanistic lecture that he would give us every day. And, after the war, to our great satisfaction, but not surprise, he was named as the first director of the Hungarian Academy of Physical Sciences, so, he, they reco gnized him. And he was then, I ta lked to him later and he was in the Illegal Social Democratic Party, so that also helped him. But, there were teachers and I had a teacher, I don\u2122t even know if he had any political conviction, but he was a human being and he always tried to mitigate any law, anything, but, but as a child, for example, ev en, even in middle school, I had to go once a week to three hours of, of labor, battalion practice. This was one of the most humiliating experiences that anybody can have. They had the scum of earth in ch arge of us, it was not teachers or any\u2013 we had to report eith er at school or somewhere on the outskirts of Budapest to a practice ground where these hired in structors that were a lot worse than any drill instructor I have ever seen in an y movie, any Ameri can movie, because it\u2122s not that, it was not just the physical, the physical abuse can be tolerated, bu t it is the mental abuse, but that was so, so bad, the way they called us everything, a Jewish this and a Jewish that, an d these were people hired to do this job and besides of marching and, and digging and building, co nstantly, we were abused and constantly even physically so. Many times they b eat us and all this. And we had to go there about three hours on a certain day. The Christians then went to three ho urs of practice of what you would call today ROTC. They had, they had marching drill practices and all this. But ours was completely different."

He was called up to go to the eastern front and, and he go into la bor battalions, in \u212241, I\u2122m talking about \u212241 because that\u2122s when Germany declared war, Germany attacked the Soviet Union. Immediately, the very young, I think twenty-one old Jewish men were called up. They had to go to a certain place in their own clothes. They didn\u2122t get any unifor m, anything, and take n to the eastern front immediately for mine, got to, to pick up mines, okay? And many of them without any previous experience and, and, and any schooling as to how to do it, of course, blew up. Now, the reason I am mentioning this because my fath er\u2122s sister who was very young and married to a young man, interestingly, when he was taken to the front, for some reason, so mebody made a mistake and his unit was issued Hungarian army uniforms."

By the time, the picture arrived at home, he was dead. He was blown up on a mine. And this pi cture initiated a whole avalanche of events in our family because my aunt who was an extremely shrewd person, used this picture to start, to basic\u2013 declaring herself firs t as half-Jewish, which was an exceptional position then. And as the Nuremburg laws were tightened more and more so, she took one more step and one more step and one more step in pushing this whole idea that she\u2122 s not really under this category of the Nuremburg laws. And it, the whole thing accelerated to the point where th e last, when the only way she could be declared an exceptional perso n, as they were called, which means that you\u2122re not considered Jewish, was to take my grandmothe r down to the police statio n and that was a scene I remember: her taking my grandm other down and my grandmother had to, under oath, sign an affidavit that she is an, she was an illegitimate child because my grandmother was cleaning house for a lawyer, a Christian lawyer who was dead by that time, a bachelor. And she signed this affidavit which made her a, a Christian. And with a husband who died in military uniform, so he was obviously a Christian, with he r mother signing this affidavit th at she was illegitimate, and the father was a Christian, she practical ly cleared herself and then set out to save the rest of the family. And, as I mentioned to you before , she did an excellent job up until 1944, October, that was the point where nobody could do anything anymore be cause hell broke loose in Hungary and the scum of earth, the worst elements, the so-called Arrow Cross Party took over and ruled from October 15 th until January 18 th when Pest was liberated."

            "answer": "Okay, my father was taken away several times. You know, Hungar y was kind of a strange part of that Nazi area because the Hungarians, the Hungarian government ha s always been in the hands of the aristocracy, Hungarian aristocr acy, and the Hungarian aristocracy had no taste for Jews but also had no taste for killing or murderin g Jews. They were above this, an d so therefore when the dictator of Hungary, Admiral Horthy, had to appoint a government, most of the time that government would not eventually do everything that the Germans want ed them to do. So it was almost like playing musical chairs, I mean, Hu ngary\u2122s a very small country and you don\u2122t have that many politicians, aristocrats to go around, but almo st the same faces somehow appeared , if not as prime minister then maybe minister of interior, or something. So we really, up until 1944, we had a great deal of antiSemitism, we had a great deal of persecution of Jews but we were not in fear of our lives. Because somehow that was below the dignity of that class. Not only that, some of those aristocrats were very Anglophiles and had, during the war, connections with the British. And so in between, it depended on which aristocrat was in charge of the country. Some of them were a little bit more 10 German-oriented than others. And when, and more German-oriented came into the picture because the Germans didn\u2122t like the one who wa s in office, then he ordered that so and so is going to go and serve in, these Jews will be taken to the labor battalion. My father was in the labor battalion before he was taken to Yugoslavia but he was inside Hu ngary so we could visit him, we could take food for him and eventually, when a ne w prime minister came, he declar ed that anybody over let\u2122s say, forty-five can go home. So there was no fear of being killed just because you are, you\u2122re a Jew. Up until 1944, March, when the Germans marc hed into Hungary."

And so it was not the same thing as taken away to a faraway country where we had no idea what would happen to him. Now, there, there, th en in 1942, he was taken away for, for good . For some reason, and I cannot really remember exactly what happened and why. We had, probably, a more radical prime minister who yiel ded to the German s and let this contingent of Jewish labor battalions go outside th e country and he was then taken to Yugoslavia. I remember, even then, they, they we re told which railroad station are they going to be going through in Budapest and they allowed them to be there I think half an hour or an hour where we had a visit with him so we could talk over a few things. And th at was the last I saw him, then, for a couple of years until he came back after the war."

And he was there, he wa s always telling me about what was, what was interesting, the various people who guarded them. They had Croats, they had German, they was all SS, Croat, Croatian SS, German SS, Hungarian, not SS, but Hungarian, and I think that they had something, I\u2122ve forgot what, but anyway, various nationalities were guarding them and probably Bosnians. And he mentioned wh en he came home, interestingly, he said, \ufb01Son,\ufb02 he said, \ufb01we never, we never re ally worried too much about anyone else guarding us except the Croatians.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01We had never seen such be asts as the Croatian SS was.\ufb02 They called them Usta\u0131as, you know. He was there and I think, I, th is is probably much better written than in my memory, I think about one hundred fifty thousand were in this pa rticular area where he was and what happened was when, when th e Tito partisans were really pushing them ba ck, The Germans decided to march them back toward Germany and in, in what is northern, what was northern Yugoslavia at that time and previously back be fore 1918, was southern H ungary, they set up these slaughterhouses, where those who survived the concentration camp ___________ were killed and my father was in the last six thousand bei ng marched and they were captured by Tito\u2122s partisans. And then he was given a choice wh ether he could fight with the pa rtisans, he could work for the partisans, or they would allow hi m to go into an area that was al ready liberated and live there and they would supply him with enough food to survive until the war is over, they said. And he was a very strong man and very grateful that they save d his life and he volunt eered to work. So he worked in a flour mill somewhere around and cam e home with all kinds of documents and, and little medals that testified to the f act that he was a good worker and did his share. And he was very proud of it, and when Stalin decided to eradicate any of th e memories attached to Tito, 11 unfortunately we had to burn everything and we ha d to throw away his medals because it was very dangerous to be in the possession of anything that connects you to Tito. Peop le were hanged all the time without not much reason, let alone if they find something on you. So, he was very bitter about this, and this turned him against the Russians so in all his life he was very anti-Russian and very pro-Yugoslavian. He would have been heartbroke n to see what happened to Yugoslavia had he lived today."

            "answer": "Well, of course we were alwa ys afraid that he would not survive and we had no doubt that physically he could survive but we were afraid that, that he wo uld get killed. But an interesting episode was that, [cough] excuse me, I asked him af ter the war, what, why did he survive if so many people died? And he had a little, just a short little anecdote, he said, \ufb01Son, there were two kinds of people in the concentration camp. We got a canteen of water ev ery morning. The one group drank the water immediately and the second group, such as myself, drank half of the water during the day and we used the other half to wash ourselves.\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01Half a cant een of water would make you clean?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01No, but I felt like a human being, I was still caring about myself.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01And later on I understood a lot more about this whole attitude that I\u2122m not going to lie down here and gulp down everything, I am, even though I am full of lice, I\u2122m st ill caring about myself.\ufb02 So that, basically, that was the attitude that saved, I\u2122m sure, that wa s who survived. And of course luck, because even with this attitude somebody could have shot you if they didn\u2122t like your face or the way they moved. Yes, we, my mother maintained of course like most wive s that he\u2122s going to return, and she was right because even though we have not he ard from him for a long time, especially the last year when he was there, of course by that time , we couldn\u2122t have heard from him because he was already in the liberated area and we were in Hungary still, in the battlefi eld. It was, however, just that, that deep feeling that he will come home. And he came home in 1945, I remember late sprin g, it must have been April, May, probably, and he did not just stop by and said, \ufb01Here I am.\ufb02 He was afraid that maybe we would faint or something like that. He sent a friend up. A man came up and inquired about my father and very slowly kind of asked, \ufb01When did you hear from him?\ufb02 and all this, and \ufb01Do you think he\u2122s a live?\ufb02 and all this, and slowly he said, \ufb01Well, I have a feeling that he is alive,\ufb02 and slowl y he led us to this. I remember him coming up on the stairs with a rucksack. The rucksack was full of sausage and potatoes. And he knew that we were starving and so that was it . Now, just to describe the situation in Hungary at that time and how you needed to be, to stay a human be ing, the, we did not liv e in our apartment, we were moved, because you could not stay in your apartmen t. You had to move to first, to so-called Jewish houses that had a big star on them and, eventually to the ghetto. And because of th e history of this house, we did not move into the ghetto but this house Zichy street One, was designated as a Jewish house first. So, in the meantime, we moved out of, of our apar tment in, that was 1944, summer when you had to 12 leave your apartment. We, the ne ighbors came, some of them, and said \ufb01We will keep this for you, and keep this for you,\ufb02 and needless to say, that not one thing eventually survived again. Or resurfaced again. They all, eith er the Russians took it, or the bo mbing or everything. It\u2122s all disappeared, and what could you do about it? Yo u said okay. But people were in a way like vultures, they were just circlin g around and see, you know, what they can take. And then the apartment was given, all these Jewish apartmen ts were given to bomb those people whose\u2013 Gentiles whose houses were bombed and they couldn\u2122t live in anymore. And I had no idea of course what happened to our apartment. We lived in a str eet called Rottenbiller Street, 662, and I, my first thing, we were liberated on January 18 and the first thing I went ba ck to see, what, what happened to our apartment because we left, believe it or not, a few bo xes of linen there, just when we left. We just, we couldn\u2122t do anything with it, so. And when I came, when I went up there, I had this tremendous chip on my shoulder that I\u2122m going to show these people whoever are there, that within two hours, I said I\u2122m going to give them two hours to get out of here. And here I was a sixteen year old kid, barely sixteen, fifteen real ly, and telling them, here was a family and I was telling them to get out of here. And the family consisted of a mo ther, father, a daughter and two sons. And they were tailors. And the old man was quite old, the father, wa s telling me, he said, \ufb01But, but, where can we go?\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01Why did you come here?\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Well, we have, we have no place. Our, our house was destroyed, and I mean we knew that this is, this was a Jewish apartment, but still it was between this or living in the street, in the cold snowy January,\ufb02 so he said, \ufb01Could, could you do something, could, could we so mehow come to some ki nd of an agreement?\ufb02 And so my mother came up and she said, \ufb01Why can\u2122t we just divide the place between us?\ufb02 And here it was a two room apartment with their family, four people, five people in their families and two, my mother and I, an d we decided that after looking at them and listening to them and all this, there was just something that all of a sudden hit me. My chip was go ne and so we decided that yes, we were going to, we\u2122ll, we\u2122ll make it. And so we lived there under the same roof and we became very good friends. And when my father came home in late spring, the new government, Democratic government, devised this plan of each block had to elect a kind of a small council and the head of that council was quite powerful in deciding if there was an em pty apartment or, almost like a Justice of Peace. They had certain tasks that they can perform, temporarily , they were deput ized. And my father was appointed to do this because he was al ways very much respected by the people there and the fact that he was now good, y ou know, with the new regime. A nd next to us, an apartment was full of old, old women who died one after another. It was a, like a Salvation Army place. They, they rented it and it became empty, so my father got the apartment for th em and they moved over there so we could get our apartment back, we lived there, but they could never really thank enough and we, we kept this relationship for a long time and I\u2122m sorry I lost contact with them. But then, we had an apartment and then we faced somethi ng else because then the Russians were coming around and trying to find places for their soldiers and so they, they got, they got two old Russian soldiers from Siberia who were quartered in, in our apartment because two rooms were too many for three people. So, and I remember, they were very cute old men, we had no, I mean we had sign language, we didn\u2122t speak Russian and the only inci dent I remember is that my mother, of all these sufferings, had one little symbol in her possession: a bottle of very expensive co logne water that she kept. And she said, \ufb01I am going to start using this after the war, when we are all together and we live in peace.\ufb02 And so, a nd she kept it and she had it with her all the time. And so now, when we moved back, she, we got a temporar ily, kind of an ar moir and she put it way back between sheets. Now one day we came home and my mother said, \ufb01This, this pl ace smells like cologne water, very 2 When Robert lived there, the street nu mber was 39. It was later changed to 66. 13 good cologne water,\ufb02 and she rushed to her cologne water in the armoir but these two Siberians, Russians were very hard pressed to get alcohol, a nything, they would drink. I mean, there were stories that I can\u2122t believe, that they went to the museum and dran k alcohol out of these scientific lab experiments and\u0160including embryos\u0160but I never believed those stories, but this is true. They drank my mother\u2122s cologne water. They were so, so hard pressed for alcohol. And that was about our only experience with Russians in our house. Otherwise, most people lost their watches. They were very hard pressed for watches. It was a time when nobody in his right mind would walk around in Budapest with a watch on his wrist. Th ey just, they were fascinated. They stop you and they took your watch. That was their, thei r, their thing. Well, anyway, okay, ask."

And his parents gave me his papers too so I had kind of this double in surance, moving around, in case I needed it. For a while, I did not 15 use these papers. I waited until, you know, we go t the point where it was necessary. Also, there was a danger that until the Russian troops did not cross the Hungarian border, it was a matter of a telephone call to find out if yo u had false birth certificates. All they had to do is call the principality, you know, and that, that municipa lity and check, okay? And so, actually, we waited until practically the first village fe ll and, after that, it was much easi er to fill it out, to a town or a village that had, that was already occupied under occu\u2013 Soviet occupation because they couldn\u2122t check anymore."

First, my wife, my mother and I moved to the, the apartment of one of my father\u2122s friends. They were Seventh-Day Adven tists. And they offered their place but soon they learned that Seventh-Day Adventists are just in the same danger as Jews so after consultation, we left. Then we were, we went to a, I was always on the street, he aring, feeling, looking, what can happen? Then I took my mother to a Jewish high school which was designated as a clothing supply business for the Hungarian army and it was really a refuge for, for Jews. They were sewing uniforms for the army and it was established by old Hungarian Jewish army of ficers who wanted to save their skin and their family and hired fake guards in unifor m to come in and out of the place, putting on a show and inside they were actually really making, sewing uniforms and delivering it to the army and, and, so I was always , it was just constantly you had to change your position and you had to always look at what seems safe at the moment. And it is possible that something that was safe one week became unsafe the next week beca use somebody recognized one person in that place when he was walking down the street , going into places, \ufb01Here is a Jew, doesn\u2122t wear a yellow star, what is he doing?\ufb02 And so, your life depended on nuances, those days."

If they saw any light, when the sirens went 16 off, they, they considered you collaborating with the, with the enemy, you kn ow, giving signals. So, I had to lay out all my stuff and in the darkness I could pick every one of my clothes and still do, to run down. We had second s to run down in the bombing, started. Usually , there was no really intense bombing of Budapest. Most of the bombers, many times, Americans, were flying over to Romania, to Ploe ti, to bomb the oil fields. There was rea lly not much to bomb in Budapest, was not very badly bombed. Budapest was, Budapest was mainly destroyed during that siege from December until January 18. That was the main reason for the destruction. But before that, there was not that much."

            "answer": "It was late fall, in 19 44, you know. Late fall th at\u2013 when we felt that that place was the best place to be. And then it turned out to be a very fortunate choice because in that house, there was a famous Hungarian psychiatrist. Psychiatry was, in Hungary, at the very, very early stage. This man became very famous and since there weren\u2122t too many, a great deal of his client ele were famous politicians, actors, actresses, writers. So he was well-known a ll over the place and he had this idea that he is going to save his family and frien ds by number one, contacting a fasc ist officer and I\u2122ve no idea how he did it, who wants to save his skin and is willing to play this game of declaring the house a clinic and, and do everything possible to save the people inside the house and then he found this man and his name was Jereczian Ara George. And this is in reverse order because Hungarian names are in reverse order. The last name is what we consider first so in English you would say George Ara Jereczian. The, I remember him, a very handsome man, a very, kind of a man of stature and a fascist uniform, hand grenades hanging from hi s belt. I mean, he was intimidating to anyone. To, with us, he was very kind. The, I suppose, looking back that we about three hundred doctors and families in that apartment house jammed, ab solutely jammed. While we could still live upstairs, probably there were at least five to ten people to a room. When we lived in the basement, no one is to tell, we were just si de by side on mattresses because wh en the siege of Budapest started, you couldn\u2122t live upstairs anymore. So this man moved in with a few of his men who apparently were loyal to him and his girlfr iend and they set up their head quarters there and they were practically like a, a, a support group. The clin ic had its official emblem there and the whole operation looked like it was a legal operation to save anybody who is injured. \u201aKay? Now, we\u2122re at the end?"

I could not ge t into a high school and so it was not a long period but between 1944, I have to figure this out. Let\u2122s see, 1925, 40, right. So there was a year, \u212243 because I was, I left the school, \u212243 so I had one year when actually I didn\u2122t do much except odd jobs. My father was away, so, as I mentioned befo re I delivered, worked for an architectural firm and delivered blueprints, whatever I can find but I could not get into high school. The higher four grades of high school, the gymnasiu m. And so my mother suggested that we hire a tutor so by the time I would be available for high school, I wouldn \u2122t miss much. And this is why I had a private tutor. I was studying especially Latin because everybody suggested that that would probably create a problem when all of a sudden I, war would be over\u0160we were always optimists\u0160and I could go to, instead of the first form to the second form an d Latin would create the biggest problem. So for Latin and Algebra, I had a tutor, somebody in, in my mother\u2122s distan t family, who lived in Budapest. And this is how the year went by. There was really not much else, a little work and a little study."

So my mother was extremely upset, for u nderstandable reasons and I really had to kind of keep her spirit up and, constantly reminding her that ther e are certain things we can\u2122t change and she still has to live for her own little immediate family. But yes, we were very much aware, very much aware. And even though it was very, very difficult to get BBC and up until 1944, March, or April when the radios had to be turned in, we could still get BBC. And I learned from my father, I was six years old when I learned from my father that there is more to news than just the Hungarian papers and the Hungarian radio. He would close the shutters at certain times, he always changed the times, of course, he would lock the doors and he would liste n to BBC. At a very ear ly age and would tell me that this is the truth. Eventually, it became very dangerous because the Germans would have a device that was on top of a car, similar probably to what radar is today, that would circle and try to find people who listened to foreign broadcasts . And it was punishable also by going to concentration camp."

There was no other way, since Budapest was surrounded by then by the Soviet forces, what else can you do with it? They built a huge wooden wall around the ghetto and, according to the rumors, they would just detonate the whole thing or burn it down or, but they would not let the Jews survive if the si ege had lasted another week or so. The lu cky thing is that they just ran out of time. I, of course I was never in the ghetto, but no, those who were in the house, they could stay, and a lot of other families moved in, practically all of them connected to famous Hung arian doctors."

There were a lot worse arrangements in B udapest at that time. There were, there were people in Swedish-prot ected houses in, near the Danube, where, I understand, people couldn\u2122t even sl eep. They just were, you know, practically back to back in a room, there were so many people jammed in. This is the one that Wallen \u2013 what was his name, the Swedish diplomat, Wallenbe rg, the one, that was his little area, Raoul Wallenb erg.

            "answer": "Yes. Yes. And interestingly, I can remember that a couple of non-Jewish families stayed there. They just stayed there. By that time, perhaps what went through their mi nd is, that, since the war inevitably is coming to an end, it\u2122s not a bad idea to be here when the Soviet troops come. So that must have been their reasoning. And it was not, not i mpractical, actually. At the same time, even in 19 the last week, we were in danger of being taken to the Danube, that was the, the most common way of getting rid of Jews who were discovered outsi de the ghetto, marched down and shot into the river. It was a cold, bitter, snowy winter and the Danube was red and full of corpses. But I remember that even the last week, somebody from the neighborh ood reported us to the fascist authorities and they came and tried to disarm Jereczian Ara George\u2122s own people in the house, the bodyguards. And he seemed, he almost seemed he lpless. We were already lined up and then he again arrived there, amazingly, he did this more than once, with some paper from a very special higher authority that said, \ufb01Clear out of here. This is a protected territory and we do our job for the government and leave us alone.\ufb02 We confronted the man after the war. I know that. He was caught, the one who reported us because he was stupid enough to show up the last week before Budapest was, Pest was occupie d, and pointed fingers. I also remember another man who was a fascist officer that lived a couple of houses across from us who was also quite antagonistic toward us and we were worried about him. And also the last week, they brou ght him in with a head injury. He was shot in the head in the street fighting. There was tremendous street fighting and he was just left there to die. And I don\u2122t know, I was just fa scinated by, by this man that, that everybody was always afraid of and here he was, basically a noth ing anymore, you know. An d in spite of my good judgement, I watched him, kept going back to him, as a young man all nigh t, watch him how he was dying. And I can\u2122t, I still cannot explain this fasc ination, because ever since I couldn\u2122t look at another human being, even an animal that is dying . But somehow, there was a mixed feeling in me of revenge and satisfaction that this scum is, is not going to be here any longer and I wanted to see how he was going. An d my mother, I remember sc olded me for this and constantly was taking me back to our place, where we, our sleeping arrangem ent was. But, there, there were incidents like this and it was a very, very strange period for a fi fteen-year-old boy. My job was basically to take legs and arms up that were cut o ff, operated on in the so-called operating room which was a, a dark part of the basement and kind of arrange them on the, in the courtyard. And when in, when in January 18th, we went up, upstairs, everybody was horrifi ed. There were huge piles of limbs just piled up on the courtyard. And most of it, I had to pile up be cause I was the one who was always sent up with these. The doctors operated without any anesthesis [sic], anyt hing. There were, there were, there was nothing and it, of course, the surv ival ratio probably was minimal, you know. But that, whenever I look into that house, that always comes to my mind, how these h ouses survive. We die but they keep their secrets."

And, by the last, I would say the last few weeks it didn\u2122t me an anything if they stopped a man because they didn\u2122t even ask for pa pers. They asked for you to drop your pants. And since in Europe, only Jews are circumcised, it was very easy to detect who was a Jew. And I have to thank, I mean my life was really saved by a man who, amazingly appeared at the time when 20 I thought that this was my last moment on earth. I was sent ou t to get something, I think, if I remember correctly, I was sent ou t because a horse fell on the street from shrapnels and we needed some meat. And the only kind of meat, whenever we had meat, the on ly meat that we could get was horsemeat. And of fallen horses, horses that were shot on the street, usually by airplanes. Airplanes flew very low and they were just machine-gunning anything that mo ved. And I always ran out and I also crawled out to get water. There were certain areas where a faucet was still intact and you could get some water. And a patr ol came and caught me and they said, \ufb01Okay, here, come, come into the doorway of this house,\ufb02 and they were shouting, yelli ng, \ufb01This looks like a Jew and took off your pants, take off your pants,\ufb02 and they give me the order and I was kind of snow-white probably and shaking and all of a sudden another man with a much highe r rank came and said to the guys, \ufb01Look, I see four, five Jews on th at corner. Go immediately, see, catch those, I take care of this idiot here. And so we went un der the doorway and I was unbuttoni ng my pants and kind of shaking and he said, \ufb01Listen,\ufb02 he said, \ufb01ar e you crazy?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01I don\u2122t know where you come from, do you have a place where you were staying?\ufb02 I said yes. He said, he said, \ufb01Go back and I don\u2122t ever want to see you again on the street.\ufb02 And we ca me out and he was hitting me and beating me and just and he said to these people, \ufb01This idiot, he\u2122s not a Jew,\ufb02 he said, \ufb01he\u2122s an idiot, a young idiotic kid who wants to be a hero apparent ly. Go back to your mother and don\u2122t ever leave the house.\ufb02 And I told my mother this story and of course, she never let me, the last week sh e never let me leave the place, under no circumstances. And interes tingly, about four, five weeks after we were liberated, I went to the UNRRA, the UNRRA was the U, N, R, R, A, that was the, the joint committee of the Jewish Re lief and you coul d go there and you could get some emergency supplies, food supplies, they were bringing them in. And who was at the d oor letting people in? I recognized this man. And I walked up to him, he had a huge, a big flag emblem on his lapel, the flag of what today is Israel, at that time it was a Zionist emblem. And I said to him, I said, \ufb01Hey, you know, you saved my life?\ufb02 And he looked at me, he said, \ufb01You too?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01There were many more.\ufb02 And turned\u0160he didn\u2122t really want me to elaborate or nothing. And there were many people like this. Now who they were, I was very cu rious and I went to find out an d most of the people who were doing this were Polish Jews because a lot of them ha d very fair complexions. They were blond and blue-eyed and so, and they came to Hungary early, 1939 or so, and in four, five years, they learned enough Hungarian, and good Hungarian so they had very little accent and they could pass as, there were other people in the Arrow Cross movement wh o had accents, so quite a few of them were in the Arrow Cross movement. And in the Zionist Unde rground so, that was a lucky, a lucky accident for me."

I think she was in her early twenties or so, but I was ju st fifteen. And the, I also ha d a strange relationship with an Italian girl. The Italian government of Badoglio (ph), that was his name, his Air Force chief I think, 22 or Air Force minister had a Hungarian Jewish wife and when thi ngs got very hot in Italy, he brought her back to Hungary because he felt that in Hunga ry she has a better chance of survival, being the wife of the famous Italia n Air Force general. In Italy, everybo dy knew that she was Jewish and they were afraid of deportation. So, and he had a da ughter, and somehow I had a lot of friends in the Italian school in Budapest, the Italian embassy ma intained a school. And I fell in love with this girl. And the stupid thing, the reason this ties in with this story, the stupid I did was, during the terrible, during those terrible days of siege, whenever I ha d some food like horsem eat or something, I would walk, they lived about a half an hour from our hou se and I would walk on the street, of course walk, try to run from one block to another, very close to the walls to deliver food to this girl and to her mother. And, and I felt that this was my obligation and it was a stupid thing to do. End of tape 2, Side B Tape 3, Side A"

            "answer": "Well, if I remember correctly, we did not play any games because the day went by with constantly watching out to survive. We watc hed the streets, we listened to the radio. I remember that I was terribly concerned with the expression of adults around me, I watched their faces. I always suspected that they know more th an what they would tell me and somehow, in the last few weeks, I just became obsessed with, with this business of surv ival. I couldn\u2122t think of anything else and my uncle, who is, the one who is still alive, reminded me that my constant question to him was, practically hourly, \ufb01How long will this last? How long will this last?\ufb02 This was my constant question. I was just counting the hours. We knew that the, that the streetfighting between the Germans and the Russians cannot be more than a couple of city blocks away. We saw German soldiers, injured, moving down the st reet and we heard, practically, th e gunfire as if it were next to us. Some people came in injured who reported that just a couple of blocks from us there were already Russian soldiers so it was that, that, that tension that kept me from doing anything else except just waiting for that final onslaught when I can see that our area is liberated. There was just no mood for playing. We were no t children. None of us were children. We were, all our conversations, I remember, with the, with the kids of my age down there, all, everything was always revolving around survival."

And luckily, that this house, this Zichy Jeno Street was a fairly, fairly new house. And the basement was livable. Now where I lived, where I lived before, in most of my life, back, that basement was such that I, oh, I wouldn\u2122t have wanted to spend any time right there because it was a damp, old typical, what you see almost in Dickensian, you know, movies or read about Dickensian novels. Also, there were rats, loved this kind of a mois t dark environment. But here, I remember our basement as quite civilized in, in this house.

But, later on in the sixties and seventies, I heard that he was a concert impressario and that he took certain shows back to Budapest. And I even saw his name and I am, I really regret that I didn\u2122t go to see him. I should have looked for him somehow and talked to him.

            "answer": "What did I do after that? Well, I did what probably is a natural thi ng to do. I went with the Russian soldiers and whenever they broke into a store and th ey broke into every store that still had anything, I went with them. And after they were through and took what they wanted to take, I took what I wanted to take. In other words, I did what we called zabralny which means to conf iscate things. I was full of hate, I was fu ll of frustration and I thought this, this was the way to get even, probably. And, I had a little store at home, a kind of a little supp ly of all these stolen goods that I got from shops that were just there, most people wouldn\u2122t da re to go in with the Russians, but I put back my yellow star and I went with them and unless I bumped into some Ukrainians, who were famous antiSemites and beat the hell out of yo u, the, the others, they, they we re welcoming you. They said go ahead. Also, we had a, a little Jewish domestic from Ro mania with us, who joined us and helped my, my mother and she also spent the last few months with us in this, in this basement. And she was from Romania and wi th the Russians we had Romanian troops coming in. And she was a beautiful young girl, nineteen, and th e Romanian officers were just, just absolutely crazy about her. So she took me by the hand and she said, \ufb01Come with me.\ufb02 And she went wi th these Romanians to all the jewelry stores and she amassed a fortune with in days in jewe lry. And then said goodbye to us and disappeared. We never fo und out what happened to her. She had a fiancee in Romania, whether she found him or not, we suspected she eventu ally ended up in Israel like most young people of that time. But I went with her and Romanian officers, I went with Russians. I was kind of a street urchin for awhile. I enjoyed the fact that nobody, nobody can really give me any orders. And my mother could not control me either, you know? I wa s now a man and I wa s just intoxicated by this, and so I had a little store there, that, with all the stolen goods, and my fath er saw this when he came home and found out, asked me what happened and I told him. And he was absolutely just horrified that I would do something like this and ma de me take everything back to the stores where I got it from. It was intere sting, he got a little cart for me, we put everything on it and he came with me and he stayed outside and I had to deliver it back. And I tell you, some of those people could not believe that this happened. And today, of course , I feel very good about this but not, not at that time. So, in, it took me only a year or two to r ealize that I, my real emotions that I\u2122m not a Hungarian, I never had a Hu ngarian passport, you know? I neve r had any, any identity, Hungarian identity. They, I was always be ing denied of being a Hungarian even though my parents were born in Hungary and practically everybody back generatio ns born in Hungary and so I joined the Zionist Movement. And in 1948, the, th e, the Communists completely to ok over the gove rnment. They called it the Year of Turn. And all other organi zations except for Communist youth organizations were banned. So again now I was in th e underground Zionist organization. End of Tape 3, Side A Tape 3, Side B"

But again, this aunt of ours, of mine, who played such an important role in saving all of us, again, she and I, we teamed up a nd went, which was very customary then for city people to do, took jewelry and poss essions of the family that we th ought farmers migh t like to have and we could put on our bod y, and walked about, I would say, thirty, forty kilometer, about twenty miles from Budapest, and exchange it for food. We also hired a pers on with a horse to drag it back to Budapest. It was mainly flour, lard, necessities, but of course, a horse was immediately a red flag in, in the eyes of the Russians because they confis cated every horse, everything that could be used for transporting their goods. And we were caught midway between this place and Budapest, coming back, in a small Danubian village. On the other side of the Danube , there was a battle going on. And we knew that it doesn\u2122t af fect anything, because the Danube is a very wide river and the Germans didn\u2122t have any means to get over and w hy would they come over, but there was a battle over there because Trans-Da nubia was not liberated ye t. And so the Russians were very edgy and they confiscated the cart, they c onfiscated the food, they confiscated the hor se and then, they also incarcerated my aunt and myself . And I have no idea what happe ned, but the next\u2013 my aunt was with me in the room and the, th e Russian captain came in and took her out and she came back a few hours later and she said, \ufb01Don\u2122t worry, everything is going to be fine.\ufb02 And the next morning, we were given back the cart, the ho rse, the man who was the owner of the horse and cart and the food and everything else and let go. And I can only guess wh at was the price . The only thing I regret is that we heard that after delivering the stuff to our home and sharing it with the family, when the, the farmer whose, who had the horse and the cart went back, eventually , was caught and lost both. So yes, if you had still some belongi ngs that farmers would appreciate, you could have food. Because the farmers always have food."

            "answer": "Yes, I went back to school, to high school, and ev entually finished practical ly, my high school at the age of eighteen. And just a fe w weeks before, practically, of finishing, my Zionist Organization give me signals that it wa s time to go to Israel because they couldn\u2122t guarantee that we would have more time. The Communis t Police was and the border guards we re really closing everything very tightly. So, I, my in structions were to say goodbye to my fami ly and get either an instrument or an instrument case, that was instruction number one. Then I was calle d by my Zionist leaders and, and asked if it is true that my mother comes from this northern Hungarian town, I said yes. They said, \ufb01Do us a favor. Go to that tow n, introduce yourself as, so they can recognize that you are, your mother is related,\ufb02 and all this and that, \ufb01and ask them if they wo uld like to have a high school orchestra to play a concert in town. And if they say yes,\ufb02 \u0160which probably they wo uld, they said, because which little town doesn\u2122t like a free concert\u0160 \ufb01go to a printer, here is money and have nice posters printed.\ufb02 And they give me the date. I went, I talked to the mayor, he was overwhelmed, I went to the printer, I had all the pr ints made and I didn\u2122t realize at that time that this was the alibi just in case we would be caught because this to wn is on the way to the border, my mother\u2122s birthplace. On a given day, we boarded the bus, the bus was a st ate-owned bus by that time from a state-owned company. We were all either holding an instrume nt or having an instrument case so people thought this was a high school orchestra and while singing Communist songs, we took off for the border. On the border, wh en we got close to this town, we kept on going and the bus driver said that he was hungry, we were hungry too so we stopped in a, in a certain pub or so and this was in 1948, February. We were eatin g there and getting something to drink and a woman began to flirt with the bus driver. And we we re horrified because th at would, everything would cause a problem, we, we knew that we had a definite plan. And soon the bus driver said that he would like to take about a half an hour rest and my, our leader argued with him but he said, \ufb01A ll right, go.\ufb02 And as soon as he disappeared, he gathered us and he sa id, \ufb01Go across this field an d there is a barn there and don\u2122t ask any questions, just get into the barn.\ufb02 That\u2122s what we did. They closed the barn and around midnight, or so, or later, we were marched down to the Ipoly River which is the river between Czechoslovakia and Hung ary and to our great amazeme nt, who was leading us?\u0160the peasant woman who was in the pub. She shed her twelve skirts or so because those women still wore many, many skir ts, this was the, the thing. Now she had a leather jacket and blue jeans and she spoke Hebrew with our leader. She was a, an Israeli army officer, born to Hungarian parents who spoke perfect Hungarian and this was her job, to distract. And she led us down to the river, everything was supposed to happen so that on the other side of the river, this was Czechoslovakia and the reason we had to go to Czechoslovakia and not to Austria because the border between Austria and Hungary was al ready closed and tightly controlled but the Czechs were s till kind of in between this Year of Turn and th e Democratic regime that was there before. The, the end, at the end we crossed the river but instead of getting into the trucks, the border guards stayed and started to talk right there which was odd and very pain ful because there was snow on the ground. It was very cold in February, we were wet and we had to lie on the ground for about a half an hour when they finally left. Then we couldn\u2122t find a truck, the truck left, too, who was supposed to wait for us. So it took us about a half a day to find it and, finally, we were taken to Bratislava, where the 31 gendarmerie was paid off. We we re nominally arrested by the gend armerie and he put into a warm place in the synagogue, there was straw on the fl oor, I remember, and the next morning, we were taken to the railroad station, put in boxcarts [sic] a nd within about a half an hour they opened. We were in Vienna, in the American se ction of, of, of Vienna. At that time, Vienna was divided. So this was my, my great escape to Israel. And from there on, of course, we were taken down and eventually ended up in Israel."

He loved to go to the coffee house and play cards with his friends and drink coffee and, and, probab ly gossip or whatever, politics. He loved that. And he told us a cute little joke. They always asked him why doesn\u2122t he follow me, when he was alre ady alone, after my mother died and he, he said, \ufb01I tell you a joke.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Mr. Kohn sits in this famous Hungarian coffee house\ufb02\u0160it was called Hungaria, it\u2122s a very famous, or New York, it had two names. New York before and after the German occupation, called Hungaria because you couldn\u2122t give a place New York. Anyway, Mr. Kohn sits there and people say, \ufb01Mr. Kohn, it is now the 1940s, we are after the war, all your friends are gone. They\u2122re all in New York, what are you doing here alone in the coffee house?\ufb02 And Mr. Kohn said, \ufb01Look son, what would I have done had I al so left for New York? I would ha ve arrived there one day and the next day I would have looked for my old friends and I would have found them and the third day we would have sat down to talk, about what? The good old days in the coffee house.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Look son, I am already in the coffee house.\ufb02 And my father always said, \ufb01Thi s is my coffee house.\ufb02 In other words, this was his life, th is was his environment. You know, he was always on his feet, he 32 was always going around in Budapest and he was also worki ng almost up to the last year just before he died. He was, he just couldn\u2122 t be without work.

The reason was, that by that time, Stalin was very paranoid and Zi onism was one of his ma in targets. So, it, it, this is, this is something that is not much to do with the Holocaust anymore. It was just very hard for anybody to live under Communist rule at that time, but especially for Jews. Well, I don\u2122t know if you know that in 1953 when he was dying, he looked up and he saw some Jewish doctors around his deathbed and he said, \ufb01They are poisoning me, they\u2122re agai nst me.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Arrest them.\ufb02 And practically hours before he died, they arrested Je wish doctors and I was just at the University in Hungary, studying and that was my state, the time of my state examinatio n. And Hungary had to follow everything that the Soviet Union did so th ey were looking for any body who had anything to do with Zionism. And they foun d me at the university and I was let go, we eks before my state exam. So, it, it was diffic ult but of course that has nothing to do with the Holo caust anymore."

I left it because I thought that finally, someho w, in Hungary, I\u2122m going to find, find th at utopistic state, that, that is, is justice and equality for everyone. And, I was just a little bit too stupid, to, to think that way, but I did. So it a was a, a double reason to return. A, a totally unfounded idealism and homesickness."

But they just appealed to me, the lifestyle. And I liked the fact that the social security, that people have in Scandinavian countries, especially in Sweden. And just a lot of things appealed to me about Sweden, and I knew that I woul d be treated fairly, so, that was it."

            "answer": "No, I had no money. We didn\u2122t need any money. [talkover] No. Nobody had any money. All you did was as a refugee, you appeared at, when, when we finally were picked up and taken to Graz by the Austrian police, they were very well organized there, there, you found every religious denomination having a booth, who welcomed you. Yo u could go and say that I am a Baptist, I am a Catholic, made no difference and then name the co untry where you wanted to go to. And, and it was very simple, you didn\u2122t need any money. Then, next step wa s each had a place in Austria where they temporarily would ho use you, even give you a little pocket money and there you waited for your transportation to go to that country. And that so, I did not re ally want to be attached to any religious organization so I went to a very indepe ndent one called the Tolst oy Foundation. It was founded by Tolstoy\u2122s daughter and, using I think the, the royalties of Tolst oy\u2122s books, and so they are the ones who brought me to th e U.S. It was all gratis. I came over, the American military and the Air Force is the one who flew all Hungarian re fugees over. MATS, Military Air Transportation, the, the stewardesses and almost everybody involved with us were of, of Hu ngarian origin, most of them from Cleveland. Cleveland is the second largest Hu ngarian city in the world after Budapest. And, and so here, they then, th en I was handed over to a Jewish organization because my cousin came through a Jewish organization. So in St. Louis they were waiting for me. If you were a Hungarian refugee those days, you had no problem because the world, the whole world felt very guilty about not helping the Revolution and so th ey did everything possible. I mean I was so embarrassed. I never, I was never in my life treated this way, I thought, you know, I was some dignitary or something. They were waiting for me at the airport and I was just\u2013 But first I had to spend, like most Hungarians, some time at Camp Kilmer in New Jersey which was a screening camp for people. They screened out the sick, the U.S. did not ta ke, I think, people with TB and some other illnesses, they went to Scandinavia, the Swedes did, and also Communist Party members and such. I don\u2122t know what the criteria was, but they looked into your background a little bit. And so this is how I ended up in St. Louis. My cousin stayed with me for about no mor e than two months, not even that much. He found some rela tives in Chicago who would help him to go to Champagne, the University of Illinois, and he ju st left. And we were hous ed, we were taken by an American family who had very good intentions but the man was a manic depressive so you could never figure out for one second to another how he would react to you. And, apparently, his wife felt that maybe taking Hungarian refu gees in would, would somehow reme dy the problem but it didn\u2122t. And they had a mentally retarded child, so it was not a very ideal si tuation for a newcomer although she was very nice to me and I stayed there for a few months and then eventually, I met a professor 37 of Hungarian ancestry and origin at the University of, Washington University in St. Louis who had in Aspen, Colorado, a house, and he and his family spent every summer there because he was a member of the music festival. And when they heard\u2013 I hated St. Louis, I just couldn\u2122t find anything redeeming about that, that city, and when they heard that I was very unhappy and all this, they took me to Aspen, Colorado and they said, \ufb01You can always work here for a dollar an hour, too.\ufb02 And I loved it. I stayed there for almost th ree years. And most of my friends and connections and everything in my American life practically co mes from that period. From my Aspen period, people who helped me to get ahead in, in more ways than one. So, I am, I was very lucky again to end up there. Of course, those days As pen was not what it is today, you know."

And by the time, 1974, I get an offer from a friend of mi ne in Switzerland to come and help him, he was a director of a school in a children\u2122s village in Switzerland, Pestalozzy, very famous children\u2122s village, Pestalozzy Children\u2122s Village.

And since we had only one child at home by that time, and he was willing to come so we went over. We, we resigned our jobs and we we nt back and the job fell through. Because in the meantime, the Swiss had the law, not a law, a plebiscite about not hiring foreigners unless they can find a local person for the job. And after year s of advertisement for this particular position, they couldn\u2122t find anybody, a couple came ju st as we were being interviewed. So it fell through and in 1964, no I mean 1965, before I got married, I came over to Europe to teach for the Army, just for a year. I just needed, I was a very confirmed bachelor, and I needed a year to think about whether I wa nt to marry somebody with three small children and here a confirmed bachelor. So I stayed for a year when I 38 decided yes, but during the year, I got to know a lot of people in the system, in the Department of Defense School System. So now that the job fell through and we basi cally gave up our jobs here in the States, I had only one, you know , opportunity here, to go over a nd see if any of our, our, any of my former colleagues can be found and if I can get any help to get a job fo r my wife and myself. And not only that I found some but they were now in very, very high positions and they said, no problem. And both of us, within a year, started to teach. My wife got a job even before me, because it was more difficult for high school teache rs than elementary. So she started out and we lived in the Frankfurt area and we stayed for nineteen years."

And I said, children are children, I don\u2122t care. I had to sign a paper that I would go to school and get a credential.

So, he hired me and this is where I met my wife.

You know. So, there is, there is a new Germany. No w, with East Germany join ing, it is a problem. But West Germany itself, was, I would say, a pretty civilized state. Okay , now the East Germans, that\u2122s a different, that\u2122s a, that\u2122s a tragedy right now, that they had not been instructed by the proper history teachers, and, there are bi g problems in East Ger many becau se the East Germans said, \ufb01The Nazis, oh no, they live in West Germany.

            "answer": "They would have gone apartment by apartment an d, of course, if you co uld prove that you are a gentile, and that was very easy because every c oncierge had a list, years ago this was a law in Hungary, that every concierge had a list and that had nothing to do with Jews or non-Jews way back, because when you change your residence in Europe, you have to go to the police and report it. In other words, every European country, they know who is at that point where. And so this list existed, all they had to do, come and talk to the concierge and all the concierges were basically serving the government, they were in my estimate , what I call the common man, and their attitude changed regarding of what the go vernment was doing and they were lackeys and so there was no big problem, they always could tell who were the gentiles and who were not by just showing the list. But there were gentiles still living in the Jewish houses who had a nice place and they just didn't want to move, you know? And so when, for example, at one time we were lined up because the house was discovered and this George Ara Jereczian was not th ere with his guards. I think they went to buy, get some rations for the house, and so we were really without any defense, and we were lined up, then the gentiles who are not down there be also lined up because they, apparently they had known what was going on and could identify themselves."

I tried to ask them if they can make some contact, I am now really very much interested in keeping up with some other people, but they, they just, they never really bothered and they are not very good letter writers so, and if I go to Hungary, maybe I will look for it, I would like to and I'm going to ask, pe rhaps, if I can get to th e, to any, perhaps to th e synagogue in Hungary, if they have some knowledge of, is there a group that still come s together, because there were kids of my age and I'd like to know what happened to them."

            "answer": "Yeah, interesti ngly, well, there was very little left in our apartment, what was left, a couple of boxes, and I don't know why they were left there, this family never touched. And that, to me, was immediately, I give them some go od points for that. But when I opened it, our apartment got a direct hit when the siege of Buda pest took place and so a lot of the... and most of these boxes contained tablecloth or sheets or so mething like that, and so they all had big holes in them. And, however, a very beautiful embroidered tablecloth and the napkin s we had for a long time until they disintegrated. My wife mended them and we used them. And now, what happened to the furniture? A lot we give to neighbors to say, \ufb01If we come ba ck, okay, hopefully, you will give it back to us and if we are not, then it is yours,\ufb02 so , and they took it and now not one of them had a piece left that they can give back to us. They all said the same thin g: the Russians took it. Now, this was the most illogical, stupid thing to say, because the Russian soldiers had two ha nds, what are they going to do with a piano? What are they going to do with a table, what do they need it? The Russians only went for one thing. Watches. They had watches up to their ears, it's as if they had never seen watches before, that was the only thing. They stop you on the street and that was the only question, \ufb01Davay chasi!\ufb02 That means, \ufb01Give me your watch.\ufb02 Nothing else, I mean what can a, a foot soldier who is going on and on and on acr oss Europe, what is he going to do with anything that takes up space and has weight? And so it was ridiculous, but nothing, absolu tely nothing was returned from the neighbors."

            "question": "You, in our last interview, had talked a little bit about meeting up with some of your friends around Budapest and that you would talk about the war and that was exclusively what you would talk about. When you met up with them again after the war, wh at did you talk about then?",
            "answer": "Well, when I met my friends af ter the war, number one, we were so full of hatred, we were looking for some kind of an outlet, some organization that we can join, and we found it. And part of it was they give away shirts, we found a Communist Part y. Im agine, we were fifteen year olds and we saw that people were walking arou nd in red, flaming red shirts. And we found out that the flaming red shirts come from parachutes and these parach utes were supply parachutes that were dropped by the Soviet forces and the Hungar ians got the material and the Communist Party made a kind of a campaign and made it into shirts and would give them to anyb ody who signed up. And I think this drew us a lot more than anything else, the four very close friends of mine, whom I knew from the illegal boy scout organization and, luckily, we all survived, we all went and signed up with the 44 Communist Party and I think this is the first, or almost the last time, I ever went to the Party because, now we went to a couple of meetings and we were just bored to death, this happened to American communists, too. Signed up or something, I mean it wa s the most boring thing, so we never really considered ourself truly Communist Party members because we were, I think, members for a month and then we never paid any fees or we didn't do anythi ng after that, bu t this was, our first step was to go down to the Communist Party headquarters and sign up with the Communist Party, which was understandable because we felt th at the Communist Party was going to be the one that revenges all these atrocities and whatever happened, and then we saw that almost everybody who was in the Arrow Cross movement is also in the Communist Party because people easily turned, that's obvious, you know, a lot of books and essays were written about ho w anybody who is an extremist in one way can become the extremist in\u0160on the other side . So we found that and that was disgusting, absolutely. And the Communist Party knew about it and they defended it and we didn't like that, their terminology, and so we quit. So then we went back to , and kind of regrouped as old boy scouts. But our heart was not in it because now, I mean for so many years we could not do anything as boy scouts except go out and hike in nature, we couldn't even wear a kerchief. And so now we could wear a uniform an d some of us really bought a uni form, and then we just, we just lost completely our lust for boy scout life and that didn't work. Then, you know, th is was, another year went by and I, of the four, I broke away from the other four and I joined the Zionists. They just, there were a lot of things th at appealed to me, th e fact that, finally, I am going to have a homeland, finally, I am goin g to have a passport, there was advent ure. Immediately, they send me up in the mountains and I had to go through a certain instructio n, more than one, on more than one occasion. And they, I advanced, I was pretty eager and good at l earning things, and I became a youth leader in the movement and I loved to be with young people. And so that, to me, was a, was a very happy period of my life. My only conflict was with my parents. Since I was an only child, of course, they wanted me around as much as possible, and I reached that rebellious teenage period, I was not too rebellious, but rebelliou s enough to move out of the house at sixteen and go to a Zionist children's home where first I was ju st a, a resident and I liked be ing with my peer group. There were many, there were many in Hungary, a lot of th e survivors, young people of my age, just chose this as a lifestyle. And what we were doing there, we received a lot of instructions in agriculture, in the language, Hebrew language, in Jewish history, to prepare us wh en we go to Israel. And my parents, of course, didn't like for me being away at sixteen and I felt really sorry for them and once the rebellious period ended, in about a half a year or so, I moved back home and one of the reasons was that life was too free on these, it was the pe rfect kind of thesis, anti-th esis, that we were so restricted, now everything was free , I mean, and I was a little bit of a, I was a strange kid because I didn't grow up very quickly to beco me a man, and I did not like the fact that here were girls of my age who wanted to sleep with me an d all this and that, I just, I always pictured myself more of a, an individual, a man who has things to do and I don't, I'm not going to spend a lot of time with, with sex and all this and my mind was not only on just women, let's put it this way, even t hough I already had sexual experiences and the whole, and because of this, they considered me a little bit of an eccentric so that happy, I moved back home to satisfy my parents, but I didn't stay there long enough because I got an offer at the age of seventeen to go and be a resident advisor in a home for Jewish orphans. That wa s on, it was called Tarogato Street in the Buda sect ion of Budapest where I found a man who became a very good friend of mine, the man who le d the institution, a marvelous man, also a Zionist, by the name of Spitzer4 and his family, and they were very good to me and I felt very much at home, plus I got a ni ce salary and all my needs were taken care of there. Even I had a 4 First name: Imre 45 girlfriend who was also a resident counselor there, so happy, really, they were very happy days. And in the meantime, I also participated very actively in, I changed organizations and left, I was in a, I would say, kind of a petit bourgeois Zionist group and I went over to the Marxists because that suited my philosophy a lot more and I stayed with them and eventu ally they were the ones that helped me to then immigrate to Isr ael, that was after, but we'll get to this. Now I want to talk just a little bit about school because all these times I went to school, too. Right after the, 1945, as soon as the school started, my mother was determined that I should go to the School of Commerce, the high schools were specialized, and there was one th at was called, the Special High School for Commerce. Can you stop it for a s econd because I want to close the window. So as I said, my mother was determined that I should go there, of course, I had no desire but I was still a good boy and I started at that school and the fact that it was the middle of the year, basically, and I missed the first half of a year wasn't a bi g problem because anybod y who was a, a Holocaust survivor at that time can just about do anything. So this was no big problem, the big problem came when I noticed how many of my teachers are ou tright anti-American, anti-Russian, anti-Sem itic, they haven't changed their attitude and there were some other Jewish kids in that school and I got together with them and I asked them if, if we sh ould tolerate this, if they think this is correct and everybody was kind of lying low, the usual way, and I said, \ufb01No, I am not going to do that.\ufb02 There was specifically one teacher who had, I forgot, had a German name , a very small man who not only was anti-Semitic and anti-Russian and anti-everything and very proGerman, but agitating. He was not just making statements, he was really agitating and in a very emotional way and I was, I just, I reached a point where I just couldn't take it anym ore, not after what happened, just , you know, in the last few years and my boy scout commander, and at that time I was still ki nd of hanging on w ith the boy scout movement, my boy scout commande r was now a member of the ne w Hungarian Secret Police and he was an officer and he escaped from the labor ca mp and went over to the Russians and all this and came back with the Russian troops already and was one of the orga nizers. And I went to see him and I said, \ufb01This man should be re moved from the school.\ufb02 And th ey did take him in and somehow they went down the list at school and found out that I was the one who re ported him because it was obvious since I was constantly arguing with him, arguing with him in class and so. . .

            "question": "Okay, this is tape one, side B of an interview w ith Robert Holczer.",
            "answer": "I just had to quit. And then I continued my studies, I did not wa nt to have the same experience again and I went to the Jewish, the Jewish rabbi school, really, what it wa s, it was a school to educate future teachers, but it was a high school still. Just like my previous high school was specialized for commerci al jobs, this one was, basically, a teachi ng gymnasium, a teaching high school, which meant by the laws of Hungary at that time that on ce you finished\u0160and it was instead of four, five classes, so you we re nineteen when you finished the school\u0160you were then an elementary school teacher at the ag e of nineteen without any college education. I was there at this school and, of course, as far as any kind of a ba d experience, I didn't have any. Now I was among my own people, there were some ve ry, very good friends, I liked the school, it was nothing special, it was not challenging me, the only aspect most of us didn't like is the relig ious aspect, which we 46 didn't take very seriously. So actually, I was still in that school in my eighteenth year when eventually, and we will go back to this, I emigra ted, emigrated to Israel, and so I never really finished my high school. But out of deference to what happened and all this, I got a diploma. So I had a high school diploma which, of course, my parents got later because I needed one and\u2013 so these are the two schools. Once I reached this level of the, this, th e Jewish teaching high school for, high school for future teachers, whatever, it's very difficult to translate into English, perhaps Lyceum is a good name for it, once I reached that, then as far as my experiences after the Holocaust, there was no problem, you know, it's obvious. Now, going back, of c ourse in the meantime, in the Zionist movement, a lot of change s took place because we had to go practically underground. As the communist regime established itself in Hungary and in 1948 the famous turn, Year of the Turn came about, which happened in every Eastern Europe an country, and the Year of the Turn is an expression when the communists took control, complete power, because until 1948, we had democracy in Eastern Europe, t hose countries that knew what de mocracy was. And Hungary had some very able politicians and was really on its road to become a democracy, so was Czechoslovakia, and probably Poland, too, of cour se, Romania was very diff erent. But, in 1948, everything has changed, we became , again, just like wi th the illegal boy scout group before 1945, I found myself belongi ng to an illegal organization, Zionism was outlawed b ecause all of a sudden Stalin and company found Zionism, of course, a tool of the imperialis ts as they calle d it. So we were doing, basically, the same thin gs that we were doing before, bu t now very cautiously, illegally, and meetings were held usually ei ther in some far away synagogues , basements or in some Jewish orphanages where it was not very obvious if, let's say, twenty, thirty people came in and out because there were hundreds of people living there anyw ay. The, many times we paraded as young communists, if we wanted to have a larger me eting somewhere, singi ng communist songs when somebody came by, but otherwise do ing our own business. By 19 49, early 1949, the situation almost was intolerable and, basica lly, they wanted to have the whole Zionist movement leave, not the communists, but the Zionist movement wanted to get as ma ny people out as possible, fearing that if Czechoslovakia is going to turn also completely communi st, that there will be no way from Hungary to go anywhere. By that time we could only go illegally across the border. And I think it was in February, 1949, that I got an order from my Zionist le adership to go to a little northern town, Vacz, V-A-C-Z, my mother comes from that town an d they knew it. My j ob was to go to the mayor of the town and ask him if he would like to have a high school orchestra give a, an evening concert on some given date. I went there, I mentioned to the mayor that I had been to Vacz many, many tim es because my grandparents, cousins, aunts, I had a lot of relatives a nd my mother was born here, and of course, he was overwh elmed that a high school orchestra is coming to play. I then went to a printer, this was one of my instructions, and had all kinds of po sters printed advertising the date and the concert. Went back, reported it and the next comma nd was that on a certain day, I would have to go with an instrument or with an instrume nt case to a corner of Bu dapest and there would be a bus there, a state bus, by that time every bus company was nationalized, and I have to board the bus with a lot of other people and I have to pr etend that I am a member of a high school band, whatever instrument I am playing, and do, not to talk about anything, Zioni sm or Israel, anything like that. And just wait for further instructions there. And of c ourse, I was notified that this is it, that we would be going to Israel and I bid fare well to my family and got an instrument case, boarded the bus on a certain date and time and I saw all my fellow Zionis t members, the ones who were in my group, and we started toward the Czecho slovakian border."

            "question": "I wanted to, I'm interested in hearing how you felt about Marxism, why it was that Marxism appealed to you as far as the type of Zionist organization that yo u were involved in and hearing a little bit more about how you fe lt about the politics of the tim e and the communist takeover.",
            "answer": "I had very ambivalent feelings like a lot of those Jews who did not co me from the upper middle class or upper class. I came from definitely no be tter than the middle of the middle class or rather, perhaps, the lower middle class. My father came from a very lo w class proletarian family which was very unusual among the Jews of Hungary. My mother came fr om a little petit bo urgeois family from the northern Hungarian tow n. They thought they were middle class, but it depends on how you classify this, as far as I'm concerned they were kind of a pseudo-petit b ourgeois people, the kind who, it's very difficult to define them, but there was no t much work and a lot of complaining. Now, because I never had a very, let's say satisfactory a nd wealthy life, naturally I had some sympathies with, with the Marxist movement, it's obvious. S econd, I had a very definite sympathy with them because they were the most adamant about taking the war criminals and puni sh them. They were the most anti-fascist and all these things appealed to me. I was, you can consider even though I was not a member, really after my one month experience, I was not a memb er, at least I didn't consider myself a member of the Communist Party, but I certainly was sympathi zing with a lot of their goals, even though I was in a completely different game by that time, knowi ng I would go to Israel. But, this is probably why I changed my affiliation and went from a bourgeoisie Zionist organization to a Marxist Zionist organization where I felt very much at home. And there were, of course, ugly things happening, the communist take over in Eastern Europe was not a very pleasant occasion. And one only had to think a little bit clearly and rise above all this emotion to see that the communists used very nasty methods to elim inate anyone who disagreed with them. And the more power they grabbed, the more vicious they b ecame. And of course, eventually I, the Zionists suffered more what anybody who was c onsidered a Zionist or anybody, like my father, who could have been executed if they discovered that he was with Tito, so if you were an enem y for one reason or another, there was no law. The communists created their own laws, the secret police had free hand and, of course, I began to become very disappointed in that. My father, he was always a Social Democrat, and he never, never approved what the Communist Party was doi ng in Hungary. And he was very courageous because when the Communist Party gobbled up the Social Democratic Party, he sent in a postcard and said, \ufb01Excuse me, but I don't want to join you.\ufb02 Which was very courageous because from there on, you could have been watched. The fact that he comes from a working class and was a very little fish, I thin k saved his life. But if he had been a name, probably he would have been killed then. And so, politics, yes, I kept my eye on politics all the time and this helped me in 1949 to just go, because I figured there will never be peace here, there will never be peace here.

            "answer": "Yes, I was very naive, really, at the age of fifteen, fo r some reason, I thought that a better world is coming. And I was deeply disa ppointed when I heard that th ere were even pogroms in the countryside where a few Jews dared to come back to a village or a town in Hungary, in Poland, in Slovakia, I think the Czechs were the only ones who acted in a very civilized way, but then they were always civilized and the most civilized in Eastern Europe. That disappointed me, people were killed, survived Auschwitz, came home and killed in a pogrom in Hungary and in some other Eastern European countries, two years after the war. And that made me very bitter and my idealism and my naivete really evaporated."

I associated mainly with my own kind because I saw that there is no hope. Now, this interestingly must ha ve changed to a certain extent because almost every one of my cousins is married to a gentile in Hungary, I think with the exception of maybe tw o, but every one of them, and the marriages are very solid. So I, a nd it's not, they are still not what you would call a truly middle class family, that most of them still stayed in, you know, auto mechanics and this and that, that part. Now, the ones w ho are up there, went to college a nd became dentists and those, they are all married to other Jews. It's a very interesting phenomenon. But I have not experienced anything except when, right after the war at school. Okay? I heard people constantly yelling anti-Semitic slogans, especially at socc er games, but I knew that I can't e xpect anything else any more."

            "question": "And you, when you join ed the Zionist organization, did you ha ve, did you really have dreams of being in Israel, or that this, that this was something that you felt very strongly about?",
            "answer": "Yes, I had dreams and that was probably a, a, just a marvelous high of my youth. The whole, the Zionists did a, a fantastic job in catching the spirit of young people and really giving us what we wanted to have. We had a relatively free life, we had, we had a picture of a heroic future for us, whether we are going to be still serving in the army in Israel or just working in a kibbutz as farmers, almost everything about it had a kind of a super human touch that I'm going to be better than all these people around here who are r unning around like ants on the cities of Budapest, I'm going to lead a very healthy life, and fi nally I' m going to have a countr y, I have a home, I will have a fatherland and it was, it was a marvelous feeling. And also, th e whole, the whole setup, the whole organization, you know, until then, until 1946 or so, most of the picture that we saw of Jewish people is, is like sheep going into Auschwitz. And all of a sudde n these people come from Israel, they are beautiful looking people. And not only that, they had courage, the way they carried themselves and they were teaching us a lot of things, you know, Israel sent a lot of, they called them Schliahs , people that, those who are sent, I think, literally. And they were in charge of all these camps where we had to go to where we were taught self-defense an d, you know, we lived on a tree in one camp, I think what, for fort y-eight hours, we were given a pi ece of rope and a knife and we had to stay up, and sleep up there and make ou r bed and all this. I me an, which young person doesn't like this? The whole im age of the Jew has ch anged in our mind and we said, \ufb01God, it's 49 beautiful.\ufb02 And when we were in danger, they were the ones who led us out of danger. I remember once I was up in the B\u00f6rzs\u00f6ny mo untains in Hungary in a self-d efense camp for a week and somebody betrayed us to the police and the police surrounded us an d there was a creek, not deeper, I don't think it was deeper than maybe twenty inches, and guess w ho is the one who escaped from the creek in order to do something, not to save his own skin, but he was immediately telephoning and all this and that and eventua lly we were released. The Israeli whatever, diplomat, I can't call them, the diplomat is not the right word because you picture somebody, y ou know, with a tie and suit and all this, but they were just, I, messengers or whatever, leaders. And he escaped, he escaped in that creek, crawling in twenty inch of water, you know, getting on something that blend in with the, with the rocks, I mean they were unbelievable, unbelie vable people. And women, you know, it's, it's, okay, after them the women came and, I me an this is a completely different Jew. I mean, and when I took my wife to Isr ael, she understood that, that ther e was just someth ing about those kids. And so this, this, of course , was, they were idols and it wa s very easy to follow them. And they were, they were not real ly demagogues, I remember quite a few of them who got quite introverted, they were not giving you big speeche s or something, but by personal example, they were leaders because we followed them. So the, the bus going ba ck to my escape from Hungary, the bus eventually reached Vacz and, needless to say, it didn't stop there. Beyond Vacz, it became quite dark and our leader suggested to the bus driv er that we stop somewh ere and eat and there was a roadside pub where they also served food. We went in and we were give n money and we could order something, and in that pub, there was a very beautiful peasant woman, with I don't know how many skirts on her, this was the reason you recognize a peasant woman, in those days they still wore a lot of skirts, you know, that's an Eastern European costume that a dozen skirts is no big deal. And she started to flirt with the bus driver. And soon the bus driver came, went over to her table, and they had a good time and, of course, we were getting more and more anxious that this is going to create a big problem here, right? We knew that we were on a timeta ble. All of a sudden, the bus driver said to our leader, \ufb01How long do you think we will be here?\ufb02 And our leader said, \ufb01Well, all these kids eat, oh, a half an hour, forty-five minutes.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Goo d, I'll be back.\ufb02 and left with the woman. We ate, and our leader said, \ufb01Okay, line up outsid e.\ufb02 And instead of going back to the bus, he led us down on a field into a big barn, I would sa y about one mile down in a muddy field, it was February and snow and mud ev erywhere. We all got into the barn, about thirty of us, they closed the doors, barn doors, and he said, \ufb01Okay, don't worry. Everything will be okay.\ufb02 After midnight, 1:00 or so, the barn door opene d and we were, they said we have to get on line and marched down, there was the river Ipoly, I-P-O-L-Y, and that wa s the border between Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The Austrian border was already sealed, but the Czechs still let Zionist groups come over, it was kind of an arrangement, the Join t did it for a lot of mone y, however, they didn't know which border, Czech border gu ard was a communist or not, so we have to be very careful. And once we went beyond the border guards, everything was organized there, I will go back to this. So as we were marching down, I sa w a woman in a leather jacket w ith a revolver hanging on her hip in blue jeans. I looked at this woman's face, said, \ufb01Hey , I have seen her before .\ufb02 And I looked and said, \ufb01This is the woman in the pub.\ufb02 This is to show you how organized they were. I mean, the Germans couldn't have done better, really, with their devilish orga nization. I mean, everything, if you understood the wh ole, they called it aliyah, the going of, to Israel. If you understood that, how they did it, you can understand how they could survive. All right? Surrounded by, of course, a sea of enemies. Once we got do wn to the river, we had to take our shoes off, and we kept everything on our head, the river was not high en ough, we couldn't swim, so we had to walk, but I was very small, and it got to my throat at one time. Now this is February, imagine. We got over to the other side 50 and it was supposed to be that the border guards change, everything was according to the clock, and something happened and the border guards did not change the way they were supposed to, they were still talking to each other. There was snow on the ground and th e dogs, their dogs were barking, so we had to lie down on the snow for about a half an hour, wet. And many of us got sick, right there. I myself, I lost, I got frostbitten and even today I suffer for that. Now, then the border guards finally were gone and we went up, there was a house where they used to press grapes, it was a grape growing region, but had no roof and the wind was blowing and I remember, I don't think I have ever been colder in my li fe since then. And so we huddle d together because now we missed the truck that was supposed to pick us up right do wn on a highway beyond that hill, so the Israelis, the two Israelis, a man and a woma n who were leading us, they went down and eventually, in about four or five hours, they located the truck, the truck came back, th e truck was looking for us and then left and then, anyway the truck came back, we go t up on the truck, the ca nvas, the top was taken down, and from there on, all we he ard was the engine of the truck was occasionally, when they were halted and the word dollar, the word dollar came back all the ti me, I remember that.

            "question": "This is tape two, side A, of an interview with Robert Holczer. So you'll say something about the group of people that you were with.",
            "answer": "I, my best friend in that group was a young man by the name of Zev Rotics. He li ves in Israel at this time still, in Haifa, at Rehov Sh unamit 14, and we correspond monthly, we have been ever since, ever since that time, and eventually when I left Israel, we corre sponded, we kept up and I consider him my best friend. He's about the only person I keep up with. Oh no, there was one, another, a man by the name of Nissan Meschel, and I have no, he is in touch with my friend, Zev Rotics, but I lost touch with him, so I have no idea what happ ened, I just know that he's living there. But the others, the, I remember one youn g lady who was with us and she, unfortunately, had eventually pneumonia when we got to Vienna, which I will go back to when I continue the story of the journey, and died in Vienna of pneumonia, and she's buried there somewher e in the cemetery and I always planned to go and visit her, but I always run out of time and I don't know where she is buried, probably there is no more than one Jewish cemetery, so when I go back to Israel I'm going to find out because my wife\u2013 Zev Rotics, sometimes he goes to the meetings of our old friends and so he would know. Now, af ter the truck finally stopped in Bratisla va. In Bratislava they took us to the gendarmerie where, as a forma lity, we were arreste d, and interned in the synagogue, they took us to the synagogue that had already war m rooms, straw on th e floor, blankets, good food, everything, and we were told that next morning we are going on. And it was very strange because next morning, again, the gendarmerie surrounded the synagogue, it was a bi g show, of course, all just in case some Soviet author ity is watching. And they took us to the railroad station where we were taken in boxcars, how interesting, locked up, quite a few people in boxcars, and the train started and I think within an hour or so, they opened up and we were in the American sector of Vienna. Because Bratislava is very close to Vienna . We stayed in Vienna for, I think, two, one or two weeks, and in an Am erican hospital, that's where the Joint somehow got an American hospital for the Zionist members and we we re all there and we we re given good food and warm rooms and it 51 was very pleasant, the only thing we were always wa rned about, not to ever wander into the Soviet section. We were free to wander around, the city was still divide d into four sections, American, British, French and Soviet . And sometimes we had to go very close to the Soviet section in going to, I remember going to a swimming pool, it was on the edge, and so everybody wa s nervous. But, basically, it was a good time. Vienna was full of refugees, full of li fe. After one week or so, then we were taken across, again by trucks, across the Al ps into, no I have to correct myself, to, not to Austria, to a, a, a UNRRA camp, UNRRA was the United Nations Refugee Association or something, so the joint gave us temporarily over to UNRRA and we were housed in a beautiful area of the Alps in a town called Zaalfelden. It is a, on a lake, just the othe r side from Germany, and there were some very picturesque villages near by, and I remember even though here the food was very meager and we stil l were hiking almost every day and going up in the mountains, and I remember that just abov e our camp, our refugee camp, there was a place, a mountain hut where Hitler and Mussolini met and we had to see it and sometimes a cabbage soup a day just didn't give us enough energy, but we were still pushing for it, we wanted to see it. We st ayed here, again, one or two weeks and then on, again, now over the border to Italy. In Italy, they took us again to the train station, somewhere in northern Italy, and the train then wa s closed up and sealed, but regular train, we just could not le ave the train, Italian detectives were on the train to make sure that nobody escapes because it was ridiculous because who wants to escape to Italy, at l east at that time? And we were taken down to Bari. Now, the only thing that stands out in my mind was that a lot of times when the train stopped, we, of course, rolled the windows down and the good looking girls among us ended up with dozens of pictures from Italian men, written on it, I love you, I'm goin g to marry you and all this, by the time we got to Bari, I think the girl s were exchanging pictures and who wanted this one and this one? I mean it was a fu nny thing to see that those men were really just instantly falling in love with these girls. In Bari, a ship wa s waiting for us, if you could call it a ship. It was called the Galil, Galilea or Galilee, I forgot exactly, and so we boarded the ship and in two days or three days, it must have been three I think, we were going to reach Haifa. Everybody got sea sick, the boat was an old, old fishing boat that the Israe li government brought from, bought from Greece and it was a primitive thing, very primiti ve. And I know I have a very strong will and I don't want to, you know, go back to that, to the story, but I neve r throw up, somehow I just psych myself up ever since I was a little kid as a result of an incident that I would not throw up. And I remember I was the only one on the ship who c ould eat. Everybody else was just constantly throwing up and so we arrived, by the time we a rrived in Haifa, everyb ody was just yellow and green and wouldn\u2122t want to look at food. Now, the funny thing about this ship is that a few years ago I was travelling in France with my wife and we stopped in th e Loire valley in a small little town, Blois, and as we were walk ing in the town there was a kind of a summer suit that I wanted to buy, it was very inexpensive and I needed a summer suit for wearing on some occasion that I have to wear a suit and I went into the shop and I was trying on the suit when the owner of the shop all of a sudden yelled and said, \ufb01Shalom haver.\ufb02 And it appear s he was talking to my wife and somehow it came that he was a Moroccan Jew and he was telling, I think, my wife that he was a Moroccan Jew and all this, because he had a definite Arabic name. And so my wife, I think, told him that I was Jewish, too you know, and th is, so he invited us after th e deal\u0160which was a good one\u0160he invited us to a bar down on the str eet, an outdoor caf\u00e9, to drink some thing with him. And during the conversation he asked me a little bit about my life a nd he said to, and I asked him and he said, \ufb01Oh, I was in Israel, I was a sailor.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Where did you sail? \ufb02 He said, In the Mediterranean, of course,\ufb02 and I said, \ufb01What ship?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01The Galilea.\ufb02 \ufb01What time?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01From 1948 to 1950 something.\ufb02 Well, he was on that ship, you know, and I mean it was a small ship and he was 52 one of the sailors. Well, when we arrived in Haif a, of course, that was a very emotional scene and then eventually, the war, basically, was finished and there was no temporary animosity so then we, our movement went to a ki bbutz there where we then blended in and one year after we were taught a trade in the kibbutz and we got our own land then. I don't know what else you want to know about the Israeli thing."

            "answer": "Yes, everyone went to the same kibbutz except the ones who did no t want to go to the kibbutz, had relatives who were waiting for them and this was a little bit of a disappointment to us because theoretically, everybody was supposed to stay together, but this wa s not the case. There were, not everybody wants to live in a kib butz because it is a very diffic ult living for those who dream of money and wealth and their own car and all this because it's a, at that time it was a very perfect community, but it was a community, you didn't have a great deal that you owned at all, you know, you were lucky if you had a radio th at you can call your own. So we lost, I would say, about onethird of our group who had planned, but not shared their plan with us , to go immediately and stay on the outside."

            "answer": "All Zionist youth organizations basically, with very little exception, very few exceptions, were geared toward the kibbutz. This was an unde rstanding back in Eastern Europe where we were recruited that Israel, and they always brought th e example of the pyramid, that the, we Jews, we always like a pyramid on the top, we had all the, the farmers, and down at the bottom where the pyramid is the largest, we had all the intellectuals, and Israel needed a pyramid upside down, where the largest group is going to be the farmers and the agricultural group, and the sma llest one is going to be the intellectuals, the tip of the pyramid. So almost every Zi onist organization, that was the very strong influence and educational goal to teach you to go and be a farm er in a collective, you know? So that was the reason why most of us did go to a kibbutz. And who decided it? It was decided above, that had nothing to do with us, where we would g o, we were assigned to an old kibbutz, very old, experienced, large kibbutz, called Givat Chajim , in Israel which is in, about midway between Haifa and Tel Aviv and this is where we learned ou r trade for one year, we stayed there for one year."

            "answer": "We did not speak any Hebrew when we arrived th ere, most of us didn't speak any Hebrew, except the ones who came from very religious families. They knew quite a bit and for them it was much easier to learn, we spoke no Yiddish because Hung arians do not speak, Hungarian Jews, very few Hungarian Jews speak Yiddish, and so at fi rst we felt a little bit kind of ostracized by the community, especially the young Is raeli kids. There were so many Hungarians coming in at that time that the Hungarians even had a nickname in Israel, they were called Igen-Migen, Igen means yes in Hungarian and so kids wo uld go after us on the street a nd call us Igen-Migen, Igen-Migen, because they heard us speak. And so we were in a big hurry to learn Hebrew. And then when we learned Hebrew, we had another thing, the Hungarian language is such that your accent stays with 53 you no matter what language you learn, and so we had a very th ick accent, even when we were speaking Hebrew, so we had our difficulties with the language, but most of us learned it eventually. I was there in Israel for two y ears and by the time I came home, I was really speaking fluently."

            "question": "What trade did you learn on this kibbutz?",
            "answer": "Okay, I was a tractor driver in the kibbutz and worked out plowing everything connected with the tractor, it was called a Falha, that particular branc h, and from sacking, you know, flours and up to plowing and then seeding and cultivating, we had, we did everything. Then we got our own land, own piece of land, which was a r eclaimed area on the train line betw een Tel Aviv and Haifa, it was the, the, the Israel and Jordan swapped land and so Jordan give back a piece of land so the train service can go from Tel Aviv to Ha ifa because part of the train lin e was in Jordan. This was the land that we received, and it was a very dangerous place, so when we, the first day we went out there, I remember, was really hair raising because the tractor drivers had to go down and plow and the, the weed in Israel is much higher than a human being and also we didn't know where the mines, if there were any mines. And ev en though the army su pported us and they did give us, you know, generous support there, we the tractor drivers had to go down and practically open up the area. And so we were very respected in the kibbutz for that reason. Above us was an Arab town, Tul Karem, which today is under Israeli occupation and still a very hot spot for riots. And I re member that Arab town practically you could see the people on the str eet, and here we were on the other side living, you know, two enemies and of course , I had a lot of adventures beca use of living on the border, but then again, that has not much to do with the Holocaust and I am sure that the Holocaust Museum has a lot of testimonies from Israel is so they don't need. I don't know, but that's up to you, but I have a lot of stories that came to us as a result of living so close at that time, back in 1948, 1949, on the border, you know."

            "num": 172,
            "question": "I'd be interested in hearing how, what kinds of relations or encounters yo u had with Arabs in that area.",
            "answer": "Well, when we first showed up, when we first showed up, the first day, there were Arab shepherds down on the other side of the barbed wire, the bord er was just marked with a bunch of barbed wire. And when they saw us, they emitted a sound like woo-woo-woo, and they were running away, they were just scared to deat h. These were shepherds, very poor people, and we didn' t know exactly who they were, but we learned eventually, that they were, they were working for the local, you know, sheik or whomever owns the land fo r very little. And eventually, we also saw that here on this side of the border we are plowing with up-to-date 20 th-century machinery and we saw not far from us, a man on a horseback whipping people just because they did something apparently that did not please them. The owner of the land had practically comple te jurisdiction over these poor fellows, and that was just a few hundred yards from where we were working. As they got used to us, they came closer and closer and wh en they saw that we do n't mean any harm, they came down to the barbed wire many times, watching to make sure that nobody sees them and tried to make friends with us and we did make friends with them for, the main reason is that chocolate was very expensive in Israel those days, cocoa, and we already had quite a few children in our group, babies. Cigarettes were very expensive for some reason in Jordan and they were very cheap in Israel, American cigarettes. So they asked, oh, these people offere d us a deal, but they di d not want to do it during the day because they were afraid that the\u2013 Jordan had the best military force, the Arab Legion, 54 trained by the British and they were afraid that they were patrolling there and all this and it was a serious crime to deal with, with Israelis. So at night in the darkness, and I remember it was my turn, too, it was always a few people and always the tractor drivers beca use we had the contact with the border people, we went down because they would recognize us and it was a very risky thing, they could have just shot me dead ri ght there, it could have been a tr ap. We went down and we were doing all the business, they jumped over or we went over, but mainly they came over because they were much better fence jumpers than we were. So this was one contact that we had. The other one was not so pleasant, these wadis, dry river beds, that run across, they don't recognize borders, they run, you know, back and forth, Is rael, Jordan, and in, wh en they are dry which is most of the time, this is where the Arab thieves come over, they use these river beds because you can't see them, they are, you know, they are like little canyons. And they would come over in these river beds and go into other areas and steal, mainly animals. And they were unbelieva bly good thieves. They would steal, they can, they would steal a cattle, they would steal a donkey, they would steal a horse surrounded by walls. Nobody could ever figure out ho w they did it. So the army hired us to be kind of a paramilitary fo rce and go out and lie, so we had to lie down in the wadis and a few of us, we didn't have very good guns, we ha d old Czech guns, and wait for thes e thieves to come. And I only had one occasion when three of us were in a patrol and there were about fift een or twenty of these coming by and we didn't feel lik e getting murdered by them because what ch ances do we have? And so we let them go by and then reported to the border police that they went by, but we didn't want to engage in any fire fight there. Now, my good experience was with the Jordanian Legion, which then eventually had also a sad ending. A ll of a sudden one day we were, I was plowing I remember, and I had to have al ways a guard on my tractor wi th a submachine gun who was constantly casing and watching because I was so cl ose to the border and this was a friend of mine one day who was a guard in an Arab POW camp, an Is raeli POW camp, guarding Arabs during the War of Independence, so he le arned some Arabic from them. And you will see why this is important, and all of a sudden we saw some, an Arab Legion patr ol right by the barbed wire and they were motioning to us to co me down and we said no, you know. And so they went away. Next day they came and again they were motioning, they said, \ufb01Peace, peac e.\ufb02 So finally they went back about fifty yards and they put their guns into a pi le and then came back, sh owing that they had no weapons and they told us, \ufb01Sit down on that side of the border. What can we do?\ufb02 They were about twelve, if they really wanted to kill us, we said, \ufb01Okay, let's go down. What do they want?\ufb02 They just wanted to talk to us and from there o n, every day they would come down at a certain time and eventually they, the Arabs have watermelon all over, so it wa s like a party, they would yell at one of these poor fellows who was working there and I, this is all I learned in Arabic, what it is, \ufb01Hey, bring me a watermelon.\ufb02 Yalla Jibbu Battiyah . And they brought a watermelon and they would slice it and we were eating, almost every day we had a little lunch there together, we brought some stuff. And this went on for weeks and weeks and weeks and we eks. And eventually we really fooled our countries because someti mes they came over and ate and laughed that they ate in Israel and sometimes we jumped over and we said, \ufb01Oh, we ate in Jordan.\ufb02 And one day it was our turn, we stopped the tractor, they haven't come down ye t so we were waiting for them, but we were already sitting on the other side, we had a little blanket, we put it down, all the food from our kitchen and all of a sudden a patrol is there, but it is a totally different patrol. What happened, apparently somebody sa w them and reported them , I don't know what ev er happened, I never saw them again and these guys were, they drew their guns and they are going to shoot us. And you know that border was no joke, every night somebody was killed there, either an Israeli or an Arab. Very innocent people, y ou know, sometimes a, one night I fe lt so badly, a young couple, lovers, 55 were walking around and apparently they were in the wrong place an d an Israeli guard, and most of the Israeli border guards were fr om Arab countries, Arab Jews, we ll, not Arab, that sounds kind of strange, but Jews from Arab co untries, and they were vicious. I mean, you could not get better border guards and they were, they hated the Arabs more than we hated the Nazis. And so they were, they were, they saw one at night, they were shooting sometimes for no reason. So that was a very poisonous atmosphere there, and I mean it took a long time and the fact that my friend spoke some Arabic and all this and mitigated the situ ation, but then the man said, \ufb01How come you speak some Arabic? Where did you learn it?\ufb02 And then he had to kind of, so finally the sergeant who was leading all them, always a master sergeant leading the patrol, he said, \ufb01You have one luck that I have a son of your age.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01If I ever see you even down touching the barbed wire,\ufb02 he said, \ufb01I am going to just make dust out of you.\ufb02 And of course, we never went back again. That was, these are some experiences living on the border."

            "question": "Okay, this is tape two, side B of an interview with Ro bert Holczer. Did you fi nd that your dream of Israel was fulfilled, the utopian ideal that you ha d and some of your, your thirst for a place where you felt you belonged , was fulfilled there?",
            "answer": "At first I was very, very idea listic. Then somehow, I felt a little bit disappointed where in our kibbutz, all kinds of political grou ps tried to kind of tear us apart. And there were more and more arguments and somehow this and the fact that as the countr y settled down into so-called peace, if we can call it, the usual symptoms that every nation in the world experi ences, surfaced, such as crime and\u2013 but the fact that there were Jewish criminals, that shocked me. You know, I was so naive that I thought that anybody go es to Israel, certain ly doesn't want to do anything to hurt another human being. There were even, even murderers, and I just one day after another, these things, they added to my little disappointment, but I was still enjoying myself beca use I love to be outdoors and we, we 56 did the physical work and it was all that a young person wants for self-ima ge, good self-image, we had a very good self-image of our selves. There were two things that contributed to my, to my coming, going back to Hungary eventually in '51. One was, all of a sudden I realized that I, in all my life I loved my father very, very much, and this is a, I mean it's a fact, there is nothing you can do about it, I loved my father more than I loved my mother. So mehow I always considered my mother a little bit of a, of a kind of petit bourge ois that I never really comp letely understood. And I thought that she was a little bit, she was just in another, in ot her words, she wanted me to be also, you know, like she was, and play the piano and all these things and I was not the type. So I was not that close to her even though I wa s with her all the time and practically, I was also instrumental in saving her life in the war when I dragged her with me everywhere and all this, but my father, and I realized I spent very little time with my father as a yo ung man because he was always away in, in the concentration camp. And now he was home and now they co uldn't come any more, Hungary was sealed. And then I also, at the age of nineteen, became somehow involv ed with a group of cynical people. And I met them here and there and some of them I knew from Hungary and they were married to this and this, I just somehow was under the influence of th ese who saw nothing nice any more in Israel except the ba d things. This, the homesickness plus the fact that then I began to get all kinds of propaganda material from Hungary and somehow, this was the third thing, I was misled by all this, what I read, and I thought that the situation changed and Hungary is such a marvelous country today. And my parents tried to communicate to me, even though they never wanted me to really go away, bu t now they didn't want me to real ly come home, they were afraid what would happen to me . And that, they just apparently didn't come across quite well because I, eventually I just decided I want to go back to Hungary, and probably homesickness had a great deal to do, I, at that time as a yo ung man, I didn't realize that you can't go home again, you know? I envisioned that everything is going to be back a nd all this. Well, I then applied to the Hungarian Embassy, got a permit and the Israelis, of course, didn \u2122t keep me there, and in 1951, I returned to Hungary. And those were the wo rst years, aside from October 15 th, those years were the worst years of my life, the ne xt two or three years."

Also, there was a hierarchy which naturally some people di dn't understand, but I had no argument with that because I realized a pe rson who ca me here fifty years ago when there was nothing here except rocks and Arabs shooting at them, has, is more equal, right, than somebody who arrives here today. It was well run, it was a wealthy kibbutz, there was very good food, there was culture, they made sure that orchestras are co ming, good ones, entertainment, no , I had absolutely no feeling of let down in this respect. No, I admired the way they carried on. Ju st a little, just a little thing that shows that how they thought of everything: shoveling manure, for example, of course, not something that somebody wants to do for the rest of his or her life, so or washing dishes in the kitchen, so there were, there were certain things in the kibbutz that it was not a, an area where you were assigned permanently, they were temporary.

So I arrived on the Hungarian border and here was an officer on the borde r looked at my papers and all th is and he, I'll never forget what he told me, he said to me, \ufb01I don 't know where you come from, but it must have been very bad, very bad there, that you come from.\ufb02 And he looked at me and said, \ufb01Welcome to Hungary.\ufb02 And this was a border guard officer. And I thought this is a strange thing, what does it mean? Well, I learned very quickly. When I boarded the train agai n on the other side of the border, it was just as gray as coming through Romania an d then finally when I arrived home, I looked around, I realized that I was totally, totally misled. Never have I been misled before or after the way I was. I arrived there and it was the grayest, most colorless, most suspicious, paranoid society you can imagine. And my bad period started with, of course, not being able to get a job, any jo b, there was no one, going to the university, of course, was ridiculous to think about because I was an unreliable element, I came home, number one, from the West, I was an imperialist agent, as far as they were concerned, not only that, I was a Zionist imperialist agent. And it took me almost six month to get a job to sweep a floor, to sweep floors and clean oil off the concre te in a garage, in a state-owned garage."

And that was the only job I could get. What hu rt me even more was the fact that my good friends on the street, some of them who stayed in Hu ngary, not too many because most of them escaped, but they would 58 not want anything to do with me be cause most people didn't want to to uch me, didn't want to talk to me, they don't know me, they rather would go to the other side of the street than to meet me.

So the, I worked in this garage for about six month and I always noticed with great nostalgia, how they have these posters about urging workers to go to college and I wanted to go to college, and I went to the Party secretary of the firm whic h had about twelve garages, had to sign a paper that recommends you to go to the next step and ever y time I went to see him, he laughed at me, he said, \ufb01You know that you are here by the grace of a few people and not, you have no merits to go there.\ufb02 So the, my brea k came when the secretary became very ill, the Party secretary of the firm, and they sent out a temporary Party secretary, and she was a woman, she was very busy when I entered, you know, dirty and overalls and all this, a nd when I told her what I wanted, I got an, this opportunity and try, now, when I told her what I want ed, she said, \ufb01Well, I don't have time to write you a recommendation. I'm glad th at a worker wants to go to co llege, we need working youth, why don't you dictate what you need to my secretary a nd I will just sign it.\ufb02 So I passed the first hurdle, with this I went to the university where I had to submit this. This was a committee, they interviewed you and they read your, you had to write your, your biogra phy, autobiography for everything, everything. So here was a committee, admitting committee, the Young Communist League, the Communist Party, one from the faculty, et cetera, abou t, I would say, seven, eight people. And when they got to certain points, they said, \ufb01C ome on, you must be joking that you really think that, you know, you can come here.\ufb02 Well, I le ft and as I was going out a man whose name was Mr. Bartos, he was on the faculty, this was the Hungarian Teachers Academy, this was the university where I wanted to go, it was called the Teachers Academy, but it was part of the university. He came out and he said, \ufb01Holczer, Holczer, didn't your father play on a certain soccer team?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Yes.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Didn't your fath er have four or five br others playing on the same soccer team?\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Yes .\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Okay, come back in September and see, maybe since you were a minor when you left the country, I w ill try and write to the Ministry of Education, maybe something can be don e.\ufb02 Well, I was holding my breath for three months, I went back in September and I went into the Party secretary's of fice, they had no idea wh o I was, they couldn't find any paper, anything, so I was looking for him. And I found him and he said, \ufb01Just a second.\ufb02 He went into the Party secretary, he came out a fe w minutes later and he said, \ufb01I am very happy to inform you that the Minister of Education, on the basis that yo u were a minor when you left Hungary, give you special permissi on to enter the uni versity.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Now, this was the last time you ever talk to me, you ever looked at me, you ever even thought that we have anything to do with each other. Never again.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01That is the price. You understand?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Yes.\ufb02 Said, \ufb01and say hello to your dad.\ufb02 That was it. I went home, my father remembered him, they played on the same team. And he was the head of the phys ical education branch of the faculty, you know? And this is how I got in. And I had a very, very good time becaus e I found out ninety-nine percent of the kids thought the sa me way as I did and there were very few communists, very few. And yet, when it came to 1953, I almost was, I was thrown out for ab out one week. Stalin was dying and when he, in his last breath, he looked up, he saw doctors around him and he was paranoia, he said, 59 \ufb01Who are these?\ufb02 They said, \ufb01Doctors.\ufb02 And Stalin was very anti-Semitic and he said, \ufb01Are they Jewish doctors?\ufb02 And I think, out of twelve or s o, seven or eight were Jewi sh, they said, \ufb01Yes.\ufb02 They said, \ufb01Arrest them.\ufb02 And th ey were, all the doctor s around Stalin were arrested a few days before he died. And then, when this happened, in Hungary, too, they were looking for Jewish doctors or anybody who was, had anything to do with Zionists because they called them the Zionist conspiracy against Stalin and they found me at the college. They had to, since this was a chain reaction, that went down. So th ey found me and they told me to go home and that I am a Zionist this and Zionist that. And Stalin died three days later and I mean , I was just heartbroken because it was before exams and all this and it was in March and I was ready to take my exams soon and then when everything died, died down, and the so-called Thaw, this is what they called it politically, the Thaw started, then they called me back and they said forget about the whole thing and continue."

            "answer": "My father's former employers, either died or es caped in 1947 or 1948, to the West, so this, what I mentioned, was a volunteer work. Everybody, basical ly, had to volunteer to do something. This was volunteer work, he volunteered to be appointed to this position and this was not a paid job. And it did not require a great deal of his time. He immediately looked fo r some opportunity and started to work for a co-op, a lot of co-ops started and what co-ops were are a group of people who banded together and formed a wh at you would call a, maybe a sma ll enterprise, as long as they worked under the ruse of a coope ration and everything was divided, the profit if there was any, and they paid their taxes to the state, this was what the communist s considered kind of a happy inbetween of state farms or state en terprise and private enterprise. Because private enterprise was phased out gradually, except in cases such as a sh oe maker that, you know, repairs shoes, but even for that, eventually, they had co-o ps, shoemaker co-ops or tailor co-o ps or this, but a few, a few of those branches, that you could not really work any other way except in a co -op, but he was working for a co-op where he rose eventuall y, he was a very smart man, and he rose to be kind of a midlevel manager, but also working and th is co-op was working with a lot of women who would then get the merchandise and do it at home. Th ey were making shoppi ng nets and shopping bags and things like that that anybody can do on a sewi ng machine at home. And then they would bring it in and so actually they had a very, a very small area, a very small base and just a warehouse and he enjoyed this, he enjoyed it and he was very much liked. The only problem he had occasionally is that they asked him, because he wa s such a good worker, and he received all kinds of awards t hat he didn't really want particularly because he was not very , you know, infatuated w ith the communist system, they always wanted him to join the Party because he was a perfect, what they called cadre, cadre, he comes from the working class, he was a hard-working man, he was an honest man, he rose from nothing to a midlevel manager, so he was an idea l person. But he never joined, he always said, \ufb01No, absolutely no.\ufb02 So that, he was such a good worker, they left him alone. 60"

            "answer": "Interestingly, with most peop le, you could talk politics. You know, eventually, throughout these years, we isolated the ones who we re suspicious to us and\u2013 becaus e they were always eager beaver Party workers and give big speeches and some of them did big speeches an d we knew that we can still talk to them, they\u2122re just careerists and they just want to go ahead. But I would say the great majority, even in the worst days, we could still discuss things. Obviously, we didn't do it on the street, we didn't do it elsewhere except in our own home or in a re staurant where there was a lot of noise and they couldn't discern, you know, who says wh at. So in this respect, we did not really have a kind of a prison atmosphere in college. And our professors, I would say eighty percent of them were very much against the regime and occasionall y they let that go in very, you know, ambiguous statements. We recognized it immediately and all this , but just to give you one example, most of us, we had to go to Russian instruction every day, most of us either didn't show up or if we did, we didn't listen, we didn't learn anything, and after goi ng through college, at the end you had to take a state exam. And I, the exam in Hungary at that time was you had to draw a written note on which you had a topic. And you were given fifteen mi nutes to take notes on that topic from your memory, you were given a pencil and some paper, and when you were called upon, th is was your turn and you could talk about, introduce yo ur topic and there was a committee. And I went to my Russian exam, and this happened to other people too, and I drew my topic and I couldn't even read the title, let alone, couldn't read the title, I just, in these years I just never bothered to read, to learn enough to read. Today of course, I'm not very proud of this, because now I k now that the more languages you speak, you know, the more lives you have, but those days, this was a political statement, they couldn't believe it, they just couldn't believe it becau se I was straight A in my subjects and so there was tremendous animosity toward me from the poli ce, from the Party secretary and all the others.

            "answer": "Oh, the Russian exam. And th en I found out later that some of my classmates had the same problem and, eventually, they decided not to, not to have us back, so they just gave us a D and they were very angry about it. But in a way it was their fault, too, because how could we get up to that point, going through all classes, didn\u2122t they realize that something is wrong? Well, this, I remember this very distinctly, that that was one way to show our reacti on to what was going on. And otherwise, even the ones who were very active in the Communist Party, most of them always gave us a signal that this is all a show, there is nothing to worry about. There were very few people. So when I left the college, at that time, you, I became a teacher and we were supposed to go to the countryside, they could not, you could not teach in Budapest the first year and I was then assigned to a little, small village, not far from Vacz, from my mother's birthpla ce, only a few miles and taught there for a year. And this was a small village of a mi nority, Hungary has very few minorities, but they have some Slov ak minorities in the North, these were Sl ovaks and they speak, they spoke very little Hungarian, but they would not admit it because they were afraid that there would be repercussion, so they asked for a Hungarian teache r, they could have asked for a Slovak-speaking teacher, too. And it was quite an experience, but it has nothing to do with being Jewish or with the Holocaust, none of that came up, it was just a totally different one. And then after this year that I spent in\u2013 I made contact again, I wanted to get back with a youth organization and I found interestingly that the Communist Youth Organization, the Pion eer organization probably could use me because, I mean I went thro ugh the boy scouts, I went throug h the Zionists, I had some very definite ideas and I answered an ad and became a director of a su mmer camp. They looked for a young teacher who, I had about twelve other young teachers with me and it was in Budapest, it was just a day camp, and it turned out to be such a good experience that the local Communist Party secretary asked me if I would like to come and teach in the district. And I said, \ufb01Naturally, this is it!\ufb02 And so I was transferred to, just to a suburb of Budapest and I taught there until the Revolution came and I escaped again."

And this is what happened after communism, and communist fall, most of my relatives and friends who were in Hungary, this was thei r greatest fear, that what will happen to them now. And anti-Semitism is now rampant in Eastern Euro pe, in Hungary, too. So this is just an interlude, I just wanted to say something about that. So I was just teaching in this suburb and until the Revolution and as a, and during the Revolution, they sent for me and they wanted me to get the Democratic Teachers Union together, variou s democratic organizations, and all this. And I came out to a couple of briefings with people, with the local council, the town council, the district council and one day there wa s some fighting out there and I saw a bunch of people with armbands, the Arrow Cross armbands.

            "answer": "Well, when I was transf erred to Budapest, immediately I starte d to teach geography, they had these so-called pioneer houses, these were buildings wher e the kids can come back in the afternoon and depending on their interests, join groups, stu dy groups. And I was runn ing the geography group which was a lot of introduction an d simulations of how a river is meandering and then old river is meandering, a lot of tests, hands-on type of activitie s. I took them to hike and I taught them how, orientation in nature and all, everything that was ro mantic in the boy scouts. And from this, I kind of organized a group of very en thusiastic kids who eventually would follow me anywhere, you know, and it appealed to me as a young, and I can still do that, and so then people saw this and they hired me to run big camps. But I always neglected the political thing, that was not, I never really cared for the politics, but I emphasized the romantic thing. I even wrote a book for the Pioneer movement and suggested a completely new uniform an d emblems and all this, what kids love at that age, because the Pioneer uniform is the most, was the most impract ical thing a child can have. A white shirt, can you imagine, with dark blue pant s and a red kerchief, I mean, and nothing on it, they were not, they couldn't have an y emblem anything, so I said, \ufb01No, a child wants to see his or her achievements, right there, he or she wants to show it to the world.\ufb02 And so they were, they were giving me some free hand to do it and I did a lot of this, submitted it, it was accept ed, so this is what I loved, that I could have some influence and push them away, mainly from politics, into romantic activities, you know, and that is the one, that is , I think that pleased me a great deal. And eventually, it was a, I did it until the very last day, until I left Hungary, and I still corresponded with many of my kids who were in my group as adults. And when I went back later on, ten years or 63 fifteen years later, some of thes e kids were running the same ki nd of camps and organizations and they always came and they said, \ufb01Y ou know, if you had told us that in the middle of the night we have to leave our homes so that nobody will wake up and assemble in a place, we would have been up there. And we would have been following you all the way out to the border.\ufb02 I didn't tell them that I was leaving because I didn't wa nt them to even have this silly idea, but after I left some of them learned about it and three of them came after me and ende d up in Switzerland, but eventually went back to Hungary. So occasionally, when I am in Hungary, I do bump into them and I go out and look up some, and th ose who were very nice to me, I alwa ys see. I even see the Communist Party secretary, the woman who was influential to get me, I took my wife, too, to see her during the late \u201a70s and early \u201a80s, she and her husband, I just, they were good people. They came from the old communist underground, you know? And though we never talk ed about it, I'm sure they were just as disappointed in what happened to Marx id eas as most other people. But they would never discuss it because they were too loyal to the Party."

I just didn't want to live under that system either, but at least it saved the lives of a lot of people because there were ugly incidents.

I have experienced anti-Semitism all the time, [coughs ] excuse me, and even when I go home nowadays to visit, well I haven't been to Hungary fo r the last three years, but the letters I receive from my relatives constantly refer to that and my family was ne ver very much interested in brin ging this out because they are, rather, they consider themselves Hungarians, the ones who are living in Hungary today and I'm always surprised that this is a main concern to them , so apparently this situation has never changed. In 1919, Hungary became the first fascist country of Europe, even before Hitler, and stayed that way, at least, even today under the current, the un dercurrent is very anti-Semitic, the Jews are responsible for everything ju st like in the Middle Ages. 64"

And on weekends, as long as my cousin was with me, of course, we were walking around and going to a movie, even though we couldn\u2122t understa nd much of it. But just planning, eventually, to be integrated into this society. And on weekdays we worked, we went home, we watched television. And the family was... it was a very in teresting situation, because the man was manic depressive and we could never figure out what his moves would be next. The... his wife was a very darling woman, and she was the one who trie d to figure this out, that with two Hungarian refugees, the situation might change. They had a mentally retarded s on in an institution, who came home on weekends and they had another son at home, a very brilliant young man, who was always creating something electrical, or mech anical, even. So, we had good relationship with him, and I kept up with my host mother for a long time, and only when we left for Europe, that was the time when I lost contact and I don\u2122t kno w where she is.

And they introduced me to the Saint Louis that most people who were born there, probably, wouldn\u2122t know. I went to just about every nightclub, I heard just about every jazz band that there existed those days, that came to Saint Louis. And many times, in a huge dance ha ll, I was the only white face.

Not so easy to write, but to learn, because it\u2122s... the grammar is much simpler than some Eur opean languages. I just put my mind to it, and I decided, if I am here, I might as well do it.

Americans fr om the 10th Mountain Divi sion that exist... that trained there during World War II, and many of its members came back and established Aspen. It was just a marvelous group of people. Today, of course, they are all dead, but their names are on streets, and the recreation centers and parks. And it just... it was a little bit weird for me to return and see all my friends names as street names and park names and all."

The winters are pretty harsh, and the summers were filled with tourists coming to the music festival. You needed other people\u2122s help and you had to help others, too. There was just a camaraderie there, a very open attitude that appealed to me a great deal. I wa s still young, and the fact that I could get a job where I... my hours were not so re gimented, even then... there, I felt so free. The pay was good in comparison to other, you know, kinds of other areas of the United States. There was so much color in the place. All kinds of people coming and going. It was just a... for a newcomer, it was a marvelous, marvelous introduc tion to American life. There were people there who were truly the most middle class, rigid fam ily. There were people who were a very relaxed family. All kinds, and they were all... they all got along so well, that was a great surprise to me. I also loved the fact that a great deal of the town, the eastern part, was still in such primitive state back then, that some miner shacks still had cooking ut ensils on the stove, just as they left them back at the turn of the century when the panic came and many of those miners went back to Italy and you... what is today Yugoslavia. So, there was a little bit of the old. Not everything was concrete and glass, and well, even today the town has preserved a few buildings. I was very glad to see that not everything is rebuilt."

I just have to add one more thing to this, that interestingly, the reason I am so fond of Aspen, even today, b ecause I believe that my life in America was shaped by that two and a half years I spent in Aspen. Almost every major friendship, almost every major contact I had, af ter I left Aspen, was based on something that happened to me in Aspen. Almost every one of them .

            "answer": "When I arrived there, immediately, the next day, I started to wash dishes in a little caf\u00e9 house called the Epicure. And I was there, I think, for no more than five days or so, when a very nice looking Austrian gentleman stopped by and, who looked, I remember, who looked exactly like the famous French actor, back then Fernandel, and said to me... he watched me washing dishes and he said, \ufb01Oh, I am so and so, I am a friend of Mr. Chabay.\ufb02 And that was the gentleman who brought me to Aspen. He said, \ufb01And I would like you to come over and see my shop.\ufb02 And he brought me over to his shop, he had a nice je welry and gift shop, and it was... he was a watchmaker and that was his main profession, but he also had a very, very nice place. And he asked me... we conversed in German, since he was Austrian and I spoke much better German than English and he said, \ufb01How do you like my shop?\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01What a nice, nice, cute place.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Would you like to work for me? I can give you this much,\ufb02 which was a lot more than washing dishes. I said, \ufb01But how can you hire me? I don\u2122t speak English.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01I didn\u2122t ask you whether you speak English or not, I asked you whether you like my shop.\ufb02 And he said... And I said, \ufb01Yes,\ufb02 and he said, \ufb01You\u2122re hi red.\ufb02 And that was the kind of attitude that prevailed in Aspen. Easy going, fun loving, a lot of kidding. So I worked for Kurt Breznits, and I started to work for him, this was in 1957, about , I would say, July. And our friendship survived for forty-two years, because he\u2122s the one, he and his wife, in their eighties, I visited them last year. Now, I work there until late fall... early fall, excuse me. A young man came in around September, and by that time there weren\u2122t t oo many people in Aspen, because it\u2122s a seasonal place. At least back then, the off season, you could hardly see anybody in the street. At the end of September, people were leaving, the music festival was over, and the ski season came around in December. So everybody left, vacation, travel. A young man came in and started to talk to me. He said, \ufb01I got a problem, my mother has a birt hday and I have to get something for her.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Look, that\u2122s not... shouldn\u2122t be a problem.\ufb02 In my broken English I said that, and he looked at me and he immediately said, \ufb01Well, where are you from?\ufb02 And of course, the whole story came about and I said, \ufb01Well, why is it a problem to buy something for your mother?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Because she has everything.\ufb02 And this is how I met a then young man by the name of Sheldon Rich, who was the son of a Chicago banking famil y. And on his twenty-first birthday he received a nightclub from his parents, called, The Limelite. He just kept coming back and talking to me, and we just became really... friends. We\u2122d occasi onally go out at night and he would bring his date and I would bring a date, and had a very nice relationship. And then he came back later on, and he said, \ufb01I have to leave my place, and there ar e three apartments in the nightclub. I just hate to leave the place unattended. Woul d you mind moving into one of th e apartments? You can just stay there, and when I come back we can just share apartments, and no problem.\ufb02 Well, who\u2122d... who would refuse a free apartment? I moved in to the Limelite apartment, and when he came 74 back in December to open it that year, he said to me, \ufb01Look, I desperately need somebody that I can trust, to be the cashier. How would you like to work for me?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01I double your salary.\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01Well, I would do that, but I am very loyal to my boss, whom I love dearly and I just... I just can\u2122t leave.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Oh, this is America. We don\u2122t ha ve to worry about that. I\u2122ll take care of that, I\u2122ll talk to him.\ufb02 He sa id, \ufb01You know, Robert, here, we don\u2122t even show up when we leave, we just call and say, send my ch eck somewhere.\ufb02 He says, \ufb01There\u2122s no loyalty here.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01No? You want me to be loya l to you.\ufb02 The conversation went on and on and on and I said, \ufb01Well, I just cannot go to my friend, Kurt Breznits a nd say, \u201aI am leaving,\u2122 because you double my salary.\ufb02 But the truth is, I needed money very badly to go back to school. That was my aim, that once I mastered the language, I would go back to school. So, by the... I went to work next day, and my boss and friend, Kurt Breznits was laughing and said, \ufb01Robert, you don\u2122t have to have these problems in this country. Th is is not Europe, and not only that, I would be delighted if you can make twice as much money as you made here. I can\u2122t afford that salary.\ufb02 But I said, \ufb01But we were such good friends.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Well, from now on, as long as you\u2122re in Aspen, every Friday night, we will have dinner in my family home.\ufb02 So... and we did that, just every Friday, I usually work late Fridays, so they had an early dinner, just so I can come. And we had dinner together and talked a great deal. And we saw each other other nights too, but that problem was solved, but I could never understand this distance that is between employees and employers. I\u2122m still, even in my old days, as a hi gh school teacher and all this, I would have been very hesitant to go and report to somebody that I found a better place and I want to leave. I know it\u2122s silly, but it was just pounded into me that you are loyal. And so I worked for the Limelite, which became a very well-known ni ghtclub those days, with a lot of folk singers, as that was the time when the Kingston Trio a nd all the others became famous and it was the... you know, the great time of folk singing. Pete Seeger and all th e rest, the... most of them came to this nightclub. And eventually, from cashier, I was promoted and eventually I ended up managing the place. And then my friend and boss, Sheldon Rich, became lucky, because his hated nightclub was sold. He could sell it to a group of folksingers who were singing there, three, four people, and they formed a group called \ufb01The Limeliters,\ufb02 named after the club, became famous, and now they could buy the club from him. So, he sold the club, and I became the employee of the group, and... up until 1959, when I left. But I maintained re lations with one of the group, and his family. These are people who still very much around t oday, you know, the four. And one of them, Glenn Yarbrough, who was my friend, is still producing CD\u2122s."

As Aspen b ecame more and more fashionable, everything became more expensive. Besides, I had no intere st in opening a business. I always thought of myself as an educator. I wanted to go back to school, and luckily, I got together with some adventuresome kids, and they told me about Alaska . They said that in Alaska you can make a lot of money and it\u2122s fascinating, and it\u2122 s beautiful. And I loved to travel , so it was just a spur of a moment when I decided that at the end of the season, around April, I would go and follow them to Alaska, and would try to make money, and th en, eventually, that fall, I was going back to school in Fresno. 75"

            "answer": "Why Fresno? Yeah, people always ask me this question, because I\u2122m the most unlikely person to end up in a central California town of practically no distinction. Hundred, hundred ten degrees heat. Why Fresno? Because they were the only ones , back those days, who answered my letters... not giving me a scholarship, because I had trouble getting my records together from Hungary. It was against the law, at that time , to send anything out, and I had to wait for my parents to find an opportunity to send it out with somebody. And s o, I just... a college had to accept me on my word, and apparently they were afraid to do that. But Fresno said okay, you can come, spend a semester, we\u2122ll find out how you function here, and then we will determine your status, based on that. And we cannot give you a scholarship, but we can assure you about the National Defense Scholarship, which was given to people who eventually end up in education. And so I applied for that, and I got a National Defense loan, excuse me , not scholarship. That\u2122s what it was called back then. And I received that loan, and so eventually, after Alaska, I ended... I ended up in Fresno. And of course, that was another eye opener, another piece of America that was very unknown to me. And it was a little bit of a crazy town, with... Fresno is the center of the Armenian population in America. And they were ... I hit it off with them extremely well, no problem, until they found out that I am writing my master thesis on Turko-American relations in 1918-1920, and that was the time when the Armenian s were persecuted terribly. And of course, no nation is all bad, no nation is all good. And of course, when they were reading a little bit of my thesis, they found out that I was very sympat hetic to Kemal Ataturk. Of course, I condemned the method of getting rid of Armenians, but I was... I found some goodness. So we had some little differences, but all in all, I liked the people in Fresno. I liked them. I had a lot of foreign, foreign students, colleagues in the college and it was probably easier for me to navigate there, than if I had gone to a big institution, where I would have been just a strange fish. Here I had a chance to talk to professors. It wa s just a very relaxed atmosphere."

I just couldn\u2122t find words to describe it to my parents, the beauty of the area and the very uniqueness that the San Francisco Bay Area had for me. And still, it holds just a fascination. It\u2122s almost like Europe in the United States, when I walked the streets of San Francisco. I lived in Tiburon... Belvedere... no, Tiburon, I\u2122m sorry. I lived in Tiburon, Belvedere is just next door, which at that time was affordable for a bachelor schoolteacher like myself. Today, of course, it would be impossible. And I had a nice little apartment in a duplex, overlooking what they ca ll Raccoon Straight. And th ese are small, little islands in the bay. The sailboats were going back and forth all day. Tourists, you know, boats, and it was just a very, very picturesque environment. The type of people I associated with, mainly through school, through my job, were very pleasant. Most of them were very young, and we did a lot of things together. I also had plenty of opportunity, of course, to go on my own. And those days, I just was a restless spirit. I had a tendency to walk down, for example, at night, and see the streets... the lights of San Francisco, and just feel that there is something going on in the city that I\u2122m not part of, and I just have to hop into my car and go there. And I did that, and it was then fifteen minutes, twenty minutes, I was in the city, going around. And so then, I was walking around and I was happy, and I did a couple of things. And then I looked back and I saw the lights of Belvedere or Tiburon or Sausalito, and I felt that there... something must be going on and I\u2122m not part of it, so I hopped in my car and went back. So I was just restlessly looking for that unknown beauty which really was just around me, all over. And I loved to hike up on Mount Tamalpais. Mill Valley, all those communities were very unique to me, and I thought I would live my life here, probably forever."

And so, I just... I didn\u2122t really consider teaching these children a great deal different than teaching regular children. As a matter of fact, in certain aspects, in certain sense, it was even easier because they were so loyal and devoted to you. Naturally, there were some problems with emotionally disturbed kids , who were in this group, too. But basically, it was easy, because of their love and devotion. And I stayed in it for ten years, and after ten years, I honestly said to myself, I\u2122m burned out, I have nothing more to give, and this is when I 77 returned to regulating... teaching so-called normal children, if there is such thing. And my wife, yeah, I met my wife at a teacher\u2122s meeting, and our superiors, our administrators, were a rather strange bunch of people, who had sometimes ve ry unreasonable requests, and it had nothing to do with education, such as we should have two pairs of shoes in our drawers, so we would never have dusty shoes. And saying this to people who had to go out in the playground almost every hour, I mean it was strange. And they criticized the way we dressed or what we said, or we looked, and they didn\u2122t much do it to me, but to... because I was a man, and I was the only man on the faculty of the county, but mainly to wome n. And... so I met my wife and at that time she was married with three children. And she struck me as a kind of a person who doesn\u2122t really want others to know much about her. And I f ound out later there was a reason for that. Then\u2013 and we just discussed things, and I in my mind said, \ufb01Oh, this la dy\u2122s quite cold.\ufb02 That was my first impression.

And then the relationship changed after her phone call, when she asked for some help, because I thought if a woman is really cold and reserved, she wouldn\u2122t call me and ask for help. And so I called her back and we started to chat, and from there on, occasionally, we called each other. But we never talked about personal things, and so, the whole thing kind of petered out. And then, later, a year or two years later, I was invited to a party, and to one of our colleagues, and he said, \ufb01Oh, by the way, Jan got a divorce. She is divorced, and she looks good.\ufb02 And according to... excuse me... according to Jan, I said, \ufb01Wow,\ufb02 whic h I deny. I never said such thing. But anyway, this, or whatever I did, or said, they considered it some kind of a sign for me that I would like to see her. So they invited her and kind of matched us together one evening, and we hit it off just right. And from there on, I began to see her more of ten, and eventually, we just decided that this was a pretty serious relationship. But I was thirty-seven, thirty-six and a bachelor, and I just was not going to get married without giving it some thought. So, I did what my previous girlfriend did, and signed up for one year to go and teach for the Army in Germany.

            "answer": "Oh yes. By the time I arrived in the Bay Ar ea, and even before that, as soon as I could understand and speak some English, I became involve d in the social and political scene very much. For example, I remember when I... even befo re I settled in the Bay Area, I would come up for the weekend and would go down, just by myself , to North Beach, in San Francisco, to the beatnik coffeehouses, and just listen, or converse sometimes with people. I really enjoyed the beatnik era. I liked those people, they were very introspective a nd intelligent. There was kind of a subdued, refined attitude about them that I appreciated. Occasionally, when somebody played the piano, they were sipping the coffee and philosophizing, just a great time, I think, for literature, poetry reading. They we re all part of the scene. That truly was an interesting chapter in my life, going to North Beach. Then, later on, of course, after we were ma rried, after I came back from Europe, from my one-year stint with the Army, which was in 1966, that is when everything started, especially the Vietnam War flared up. An d our family was very much involved in that. We were going over to the city, and I remember making big signs. My wife joined the Another Mother for Peace movement. We were demonstrat ing, and there was a very cute episode that happened to us. She usually sewed a lot for herself and for the children, and bought a very nice, flowery material to make a dress. And we went to a big demonstration over in Berkeley, and had to make our own signs. And we were getting th e signs ready and all of a sudden, we look down on our youngest son, Kevin\u2122s sign, and what did we see? A beautiful flower, of some textile, and if we looked at it, then we realized it was he r dress material that she had bought. He was so fascinated by the pattern, and he needed flowers, because that was the theme of the demonstration, you had to have flowers on your si gns, that he didn\u2122t think twice, and he was cutting out the flowers from... what... we didn\u2122t k now what to do about it, and then we decided just to talk to him, that this was not really the proper thing to do, but he didn\u2122t get punished. So that was Vietnam. My sister-i n-law wrote to, for example, to Lyndon Johnson and told him that she fears that he should not run again. And interestingly, about three days later, he came out and he announced that he would not run. So that... we felt that the family can take some credit for that decision. But, we, we tried to have our children go and learn a lot about the times where we lived in, because we realized that they were very exciting times, very unique times. And perhaps, I always thought later on in their lives, life will be much duller than it was back then. We also lived, by that time, in Inverness, in an area that was in the center of all these cults, and rock 80 bands and so the kids were exposed to all thes e people and spent sometimes days, just listening to their music, up in the hills. It had advantages , it had disadvantages. The disadvantage in this respect was that, no matter what parents would say to their childr en, they always had a place to go and because these rock groups had open house, you could help yourself at the fridge, or whatever, eating, or no matter how young you were, you were also welcome to dip into the pot and smoke it. And so it was in a... in the sense, difficult. And many of our children in the area, were runaways. They would occasionally run away because that was just the style."

Was it a bigger issue that The Holocaust? Was it more of a... did it have more of a place in your life and did you talk about it with people?",
            "answer": "The... now, this is a very complex story. Wh en we lived in Germany, which was from 1974 to 1993, I would say most of the time, when there was a West Germany and East Germany, the Holocaust was not a big problem, mainly becaus e the West Germans were bringing it into the open. It was not something hushed up under the rug. Th ere were discussions about it in schools. I spoke about it to high school students, mainl y. The whole... the whole problem with the Holocaust and the way Germans would look at it, really started after the Unification. Now, I must also say that there weren\u2122t too many people who were alive in World War II, by this time. Because I was fifteen when the war ended, and I am seventy now, almost. And so, most people are dead, who were in World War II. Now of cour se, it doesn\u2122t mean that Fascism as such, is dead, or was even... was dead. Yes, I heard anti-Semitic remarks, and sometimes, when I felt that it was the proper thing to do, I responded, and sometimes when I looked at the person, and I realize it was a primitive old idiot, there was no reason to say anything. It would have been totally superfluous to provoke anything, because it wouldn\u2122t have made any difference. I rather 81 concentrated on talking to people of the mi ddle and the younger generation. And I found that intellectually, at least, they understood what was the Holocaust. They were very ashamed and sorry about it, and I felt no urge to drill in, with young people especially. I felt that they were progressive enough. The younger German generation amazed me, because I think they are very progressive, and I think they see history in the right light. How... all this changed after the unification, because you had now Eastern Germa ny joining. A country that was never taught proper history, where the Holocaust, oh well, only West Germans were responsible for the Holocaust, because all the Nazis, according to East Germany, were in West Germany. So, those people had no background, and they had... they were not prepared for this historical fact and they denied it. And this is why the skinhead movement and all the neoFascist organizations, basically, come from, East Germany, even today. Add to this the usual reasons for Fascism and anti-Semitism, a very high unemployment and very bad economic conditions and the fact that unification didn\u2122t bring immediate remedies to all their problems. So they had to again go back and blame the old scapegoat, the Jews, in spite of the fact that there aren\u2122t too many. So, since they couldn\u2122t attack many who are living among them, they went back to the past."

But of course, after the Soviet regime collaps ed, then, then, it was inevitable.

And that was just for a few months, so I didn\u2122t include in any citizenship, just by a mistake and because of the strange happenings of the times. They classified me as German in Hungary, and temporarily we were considered Germans, and of course the wh ole thing was... oh, they only lasted for a few month when they found out who we were. But that little episode and my na me, and the fact that the reason the Hungarians tossed us out, besides being Jewish, they discovered that one of my great-grandparents was born in what is called Sudetenland, which was a part of German speaking Czechoslovakia, which was at that time, the Austro-Hungarian empire, and all back, it all connects together, and it all added up to some very tragic events, because we were not considered Hungarians, and my grandfather wa s deported to Auschwitz, not because he was Jewish, but because of they said he was a foreigner. He could not prove that his grandfather was a Hungarian, which was not true. But because of this, and other reasons, I could have gotten German citizenship. I could have gotten, probably, a great deal of money that way, because of 83 what happened to my family in World War II, and all this, but I never had, for a second, a thought. I mean, how can I think about settling in Germany, and taking German citizenship? There are so many reasons why I shouldn\u2122t have done this, right? Number one is an emotional thing, a rational thing to... that would be a little bit too much for me to bear. Second is that I have an American family, and my wife was ready to return to the United St ates. There no way would she have stayed in Europe with me.

I can\u2122t think of any place in Kentucky, that to me, looks like an urban environment. And the... most of the places are, you know, just built very quickly and the original downtown... 87 unfortunately, Lexington is destroyed, as we know it, and what is left of it is just struggling. Now, yeah, Cincinnati, yes. I was so interested in Cincinnati, and Cincinnati\u2122s history, that I took a class, a whole week Elder Hostel class. I like to take classes with Elder Hostel, and it\u2122s usually a hands-on class, but this time I made an ex ception, \u201acause I wanted to know the history, background, and more about the area. And it was not just Cincinnati, it was northern Kentucky, too. It was very good. So I\u2122m hoping to do some mo re. And of course, here and there I read a book about Kentucky. I take some authors who are local and look into their works, and David Dick lives in the area, and his books... so, I am. But I am not really an expert on Kentucky history, I leave this to people who are natives. I just have a kind of a... really a surface interest in just the basics."

And... but most of th e time, I just talk to her classes... her combined classes or some other teachers bring in classes, and these are usually kids, thirteen, fourteen years old, and I like to talk to them, because that\u2122s how old I was when the real disaster hit me.

And one little girl was just stay... just stood behind and she was waiting for me, wa iting for me, when after everybody left, she came up, and she hugged me, and she kissed me, and she said, \ufb01This is all... for all the missed loves and kisses that you could not get from your pare nts during those years.\ufb02 I thought that was just charming.

            "answer": "I consider this very similar to what was goi ng on in Germany while we lived there. Germany had an economic boom in the 1950\u2122s, just like we have now, which meant that the... all the menial and dirty jobs were unfilled. Most Germans just woul dn\u2122t want to work in that, and also that they needed more workers than the country actually could produce. So they invited in other nationalities as guest workers, that\u2122s what they were called, and they were mainly from Turkey. And this was back in the 50\u2122s. The German economic miracle produ ced a migration from Turkey, which was legal, completely legal. They had to have documents, they entered, they went to work in the factories. Now, today, in 1993... 1999, the economy... the German economy has slowed down considerably. These Turkish workers, the original Turkish workers, today are grandparents. They brought their children back then, it was allowed, which was, I think, a very nice, humanitarian gesture, b ecause Switzerland, who had the same problem, did not allow family members to follow. They could go home on vacation, send the money back, but nobody was allowed to... allowed to come. So, the fa mily members came, and you know, one family member then brings another family member, and pretty soon... I think today there are close to three million Turks living in Germany, a country of sixty-five million people. That\u2122s quite a bit, and of course, was tremendous resentment by some people to begin with. But the real problem came not while the economic boom was on, the real problem came when it was over, because now you had a lot of people who were already adults, and born in Germany, to Turkish parents, and all the rest. So now, here came the problem of what to do with them. Are they citizens, are they not citizens? And welfare, are they qualified for welfare? So, I am afraid of the same thing here. Right now, especially around here, in the Bluegrass, everybody who can think, knows that these illegal... or legal Mexican workers are fulfilling an important job. They are working here in a job that most other people wouldn\u2122t take. So, nobody has great reservations. When they see... I 91 heard that when they see something in the paper, that a thief was arrest ed, or a murder happened, and it is a Spanish name, they do mumble about it, which is natural, I don\u2122t consider this extraordinary. But my biggest fear is, what is going to happen when this economic boom ends, and here we will be with these people. Now, they are not going to work. If they don\u2122t work, what will happen to them? To their mind? What will happen to those who watch around, and will take the opportunity to do the same as they do in Germany. The skinheads in Germany were burning down the buildings where they lived. People died in fire, they were beaten up on the street, or they were killed. Several, several times this happened. So, I hope that we\u2122d... it doesn\u2122t come to this. I think that the... we need more education, especially in the schools, to make these people welcome. They are here for a reason, they ar e human beings, and just like anyone else in America, they came in by the same rights. If there is illegal immigra tion, that is not for Kentucky to try to stop it, because we can\u2122t, it has to be stopped down on the border, that\u2122s not our problem. But those who are here, they are here. So what are you going to do? But the churches, the schools, any institution, I think should work together to make sure that people know that these are human beings, these are not some alie n group that is here only temporarily. They are not here temporarily."

Kentucky Basket Weavers Association, or whatever... I don\u2122t know if this is the official name, but she participates, she exhi bits sometimes. Also, she\u2122s a quilter, so as a quilter, she comes in contact with a lot of trul y Kentuckians. And she doesn\u2122t ever come home complaining that maybe they considered her an outsider. She feels very much at home with all these people. We also go to West Virginia, to Cedar Lake, which is also a - an Appalachian center for crafts, and take a hands-on class. Our ne xt class, hopefully, we are on the waiting list, we have taken a class in Charleston and we want to go back, this is our next class. We studied outdoor cooking and we are going back now to study Charleston\u2122s gardens. We take trips."

            "question": "Is this West Virgin ia, or South Carolina?",
            "answer": "No, South Carolina, South Carolina, Charles... Charleston, South Carolina. And while there, we visited Virginia, Savannah, and we were fascinated by Savannah, it was just walking around in a European city. And in Kentucky, too, occasionally we take trips. We love to go, as I mentioned, to Cincinnati. We go up to Louisville. My wi fe, as a quilter, goes sometimes to western Kentucky, which is the quilter\u2122s place, you know, Paducah is the quilter\u2122s museum. In other words, we are active here, and I took the class in History of Cincinnati, in northern Kentucky. And I plan to... oh, I belong to the Sierra Club, Th e Nature Conservancy, a lot of conservationist organizations. I volunteered to participate in the Kentucky water watch program, which I enjoyed very much. It just ende d with the Licking River, and the branch here in Paris, Stoner Creek, was our responsibility. Four times a year we had to go down and take samples, and... so that was, I felt I was part of Kentucky, doing this. We are... we try to stay active and my wife is mainly involved with these quieter things, and I am... I like to get involved with something that takes me out in nature and puts me in a kayak, or out there, really fighting the elements. I still have a little bit of that spark. So, if I can manage, and if my heart gets better after the operation this fall, I\u2122d like to buy a canoe or a kayak, one of the two, and just go on these little rivers here. So\u2013"
