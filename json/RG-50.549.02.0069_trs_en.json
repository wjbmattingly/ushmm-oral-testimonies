This is an interview with Isaac Nehama, conducted by Margaret West on June the second, 2003, in Bethesda, Maryland. This interview is part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\u2122s post-Holocaust interview project, and is a follow-up interview to a USHMM videotaped interv iew conducted with Isaac Nehama on October the 22nd, 2002. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A.",
            "answer": "My name is Isaac Nehama. I was born in Athens, Greece, April 29, ninetweent-- 1926. I returned to Athens from the partisans. I was stationed at that time in Thessaly, in the city of Lireza, which is the capital of Thessaly. I returned to Athens t -- either towards the very end of October, \u212244, or beginning of November \u212244. Approximately two or three weeks after the liberation of Greece -- actually, the Germans left Greece because the Russians were about to enter Yugoslavia, and therefore their retreat would have been cut off. So the Germans essentially left Greece."

            "question": "And when were you reunited with -- with your father?",
            "answer": "Well, I arrived in Athens on, I remember, a Sunday. And the reason this is prominent, because I think Sundays everywhere in the world are very quiet days, sometimes they are deserted. I arrived in Athens f -- with a bus that I had taken from Lireza perhaps around four or five o\u2122clock in the afternoon. I called from the bus USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 3station, and I was told to immediately come. I took a taxi, and when finally we were approaching our neighborhood, and my house, I expected to be greeted in the street by my two younger brothers, but I saw no one. In fact, there was not a single person in the street. And I walked up to our apartment, I rang the door. A woman came out, who I recognized to be the woman whom I had seen in t -- in Lireza two weeks or so previously, who had told me that she had be en passing through, and she had a message from my family, they were, all of them anxious, waiting to -- to be reunited with me, and she was the one who even gave me money for the -- for the fare back. Of course, I -- I now know, and -- or soon learned that my father had given her the money to -- to give me for the fare. In any case -- so she -- she s -- immediately, without even -- I think she didn\u2122t even say a -- any words, but simply with a finger pointed upstairs to the apartment of our pre-war neighbors, a fam ily called Shabitai. I didn\u2122t know what to make of it, why would I have to go to the Shabitai\u2122s to see my family? So I went one more flight, and I knocked on the door, an d Mrs. Shabitai opened the door, and she embraced me, and I was shown into their living room, and then I saw my father, and only my father, with Mr. Shabitai. I -- I -- we embraced, and I immediately asked where is mother, and -- and -- and Sam, and -- and Mekko, as we used to call the youngest brother. And my father was crying, and I think un-unable to explain, and Mr. mi -- Shabitai said that th-the y were not there, they were -- they were caught, but that that wasn\u2122t the time to explain. They implied that I must have known that terrible things happen, and that my mother and brothers were caught , and no one knows -- knew where they went. That was the -- the reunion.

            "question": "Tell me how you proceeded from -- from that im -- immediate reunion, to beginning to plan where you would live, a nd how you would put your lives together?",
            "answer": "Yeah, but I have to -- to cover iv -- the brai -- brief period that occurred about two weeks after my arrival. I -- in -- in the beginning of December of \u212244, there was a brief civil war between the left -- political left, and the government, and also the British forces in Athens. And these troubles prim arily occurred in Athens. There -- there was fighting in the street, and all of us were sort of hiding to try to avoid being injured. Then, in about 15 days after the start of the troubles -- I s -- even then we called it the events, our neighborhood was liberated, a nd as I recall by a small group of English parachutists, I remember their red berets. So that was the beginning of what I thought was going to be normalcy, but very quickly, two days later, I was standing in line to buy some food, which was unavailable, and I was arrested by Greek gendarmes, taken, interrogated. They wanted me to reveal name s of known leftists. I explained to them I had been gone for slightly over a year, I knew nobody, I was not politically active. But it -- nevertheless, I was -- I was taken in a c -- little camp out -- out -- outside of Athens, and eventually to Africa. But very shortly, through the intervention of relatives, I was freed, and came back. So I think it was, essentially in the beginning of \u212245 that we even began to even think abou t the restoration of our lives. Since as soon as I finish high school in 1942, the universities were closed, and I couldn\u2122t go on, and my father had resumed his occupa -- work with -- he was chief accountant of a large textile firm in Athens. So he resumed hi-his -- his profession. Also, I must note that the apar -- our apartment in Athens, where we lived before, a -- a couple, a husband and a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 5wife, one of them being the woman who gave me the money in -- in Lireza. They were occupying half of the apartment, they couldn\u2122t be evicted, or -- or -- it was out of the question to -- to -- to -- to -- to take any action. So my father and I sort of lived in half of the apartment, until about six or eight months later, after Sam returned, Mr. and Mrs. Stasinopolous, that was their name, ev entually left, and went, and found another - another apartment. So immediately I -- I then began getting prep arations for taking the entrance exam to the Polytechnic Institute in Athens, which I -- this usually took place in the end of August, beginning of September. And indeed, in -- in September of \u212245, I took the exams, and I was admitted, and I -- I had one semester in the Polytechnic Institute, before I had found out -- which we perhaps will go into in -- in a moment, that my father had begun to, without telling me a word, working assiduously to find a way for me to study all -- abroad, which he eventually was successful, and -- but that\u2122s ano -- a different chapter."

            "question": "Yes. When you were a te enager, you had been working. What was the work that you were doing then, and you were doing it until 1943?",
            "answer": "Well, I -- I -- I -- as I said, I finished high school in June of \u212242. Since the universities were closed, then it was unthinkable, I think, for my father and mother that I would simply remain idle. So I was -- my father found a job for me. Let me describe it as being the clandestine, or an illegal market in currency. There was a -- not a black market, but a clandestine market of currency in -- in -- in Greece during the occupation. What was exchanged were princi pally, and almost exclusively, gold coins, either British sovereigns, French gold franc s, or Swiss francs. Occasionally -- and the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 6only non-metal currency that was acceptable were U.S. dollars. And also, occasionally, small bars of gold. So, this individual, wh o was originally from Salonika, and who was a -- in the stock market in Salonika, the legal stock market, he had, with his family, escaped from Salonika, established himself in Athens, and then started a -- an office by himself. A bureau conducting this sort of acti vity. Very briefly, the way it worked, if somebody wanted to, let\u2122s say sell or buy gold coins, against drachmas -- because drachma of course was, in the occupation, highly devalued. The -- the value of -- th -- the price fluctuated according to the political fortunes of the allies. For instance, while Rommel was advancing in North Africa, then the pound, and the dollar -- or the gold pound and the dollar, would then be def -- de flated. And when, on the contrary, when the allies began to -- to -- to -- to -- t -- to win, and turn the tide around, then the -- the -- the drachma would be more highly valu ed, because it would have s-some value other than what the piece of paper that wa s the currency during the occupation. So this is what, essentially, he was doing. And my job was -- I didn\u2122t do the trades, but I had to deliver to a buyer, or -- a f -- f -- first of all, even to deliver a roll of let\u2122s say, 10 gold sovereigns to the buyer, I had to go firs t to the seller, to his house, get the roll of coins, put them in my pocket, and deliver them to the -- to the buyer. It was, let\u2122s say, a dangerous activity because possession, let alone trade in gold, was illegal. If I had been caught, I -- I would have been jailed, shot, or whatever it was. Even conducting this sort of business was -- was illegal. So there was a f -- the front was that -- there we -- we had a number of shelves in the office with textiles. Woolens, and some silks, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 7pretending that it was that sort of busine ss, but actually, the -- the business itself was the -- the currency."

Both of them are what is referred to as Romaniots, which can be explained either as Greek speaking, or negatively, non-Ladino, no t Judeo espanole speaking, or they were not descendants of the Jews who were expelled from Spain in 1492. In contrast, my parents on both sides -- both of them were born in Monasteer, traced their ancestry to the Sephardim who left Spain, and eventually ended up in that part of the Balkans, which was, at that time, a part of the Ottoman Empire."

They all have , perhaps the same kind of Mediterranean look, which not even -- has even particularly darker skin coloration. Of course, a -- a -- you -- you -- you would find very rarely, even among Gree ks, or -- or Turks, or southern Italians, or Spanish, blonde people. But there were a few there, but otherwise there were no such characteristics of Sephar dim. The thing that was distinguishing, of course was that my parents spoke Ladino to each other, and my maternal grandmother, who would come and visit us, at least two or three times a week, she lived with an aunt -- a sister of my mother\u2122s, th at\u2122s the only language that she understood, and we had to speak to her, and she spoke to us with s -- Ladino."

I mean, he had lost his -- at this particular USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 9point, he had lost his wife and two sons. Do you have a sense of what gave him strength, and what his state of mind was?",
            "answer": "I can only surmise -- I -- I have to -- because this -- it occurs, and I think about it very often. Or in discussions I have with people. And I always have to remind myself and my interlocutors that at least in those times, and -- and in -- in that particular part of the world, parents were not really very communicative about personal and intimate things, with y-young children. I -- I -- I think -- I -- I -- I ca -- I recollect from cousins that they began to have conversation as betw een adults, and equals with their parents, after they themselves had matured, and were married. So I don\u2122t think that there was, let\u2122s say, reluctance. My father used to be a great storyteller, but I must say that very seldom, o-o-other than in passing he woul d say how dinner was in -- on -- on high holidays in Monasteer, how th e dinner would be prepared, and things like this. A episode of things like this. But not very much about personal life. But coming back to your question, there was very little exchange between us as to either how we felt -- I told him about some of the things that I had thought about during my sojourn in the Greek mountains with the partisans, but really very briefly, and I think mostly superficial. We didn\u2122t go into -- into that. Knowing my father as I recollect him, he was an individual of -- you know, he was lame, as you know, because of polio, and he had a club foot. So he was always hobble d. He always wor -- wor -- walked with a cane. But he -- he had a -- an inner strength that became evident to me very rarely. I think you -- you know the example of his urging me not to be caught alive by the Germans. So, I can only imagine the -- the pain that he had with the loss -- or at that USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 10time, you know, we still had a very, very faint hope that perhaps they might return. We -- remember the war was not over in Europe until April -- end of April \u212245, so the pictures of -- and -- and -- and stories, and -- and things about like the horrors of the camps was still totally unknown. So there was a -- a -- a residue of hope, although very, very slight, that they mi -- they might come back. And the focus, therefore, was I think a -- a tacit -- a mutual understanding that we had to get on with our lives as best we could, and so my father resumed his wo rk, and I then resumed the preparations for taking the exams."

            "question": "Mm-hm. You know, wh-when I asked you that question, I was thinking of his admonishing you to not be taken by the Ge rmans. And I think he spoke of that, I\u2122m assuming, because you had shown your determination not to go into hiding, but to go to the mountains. And you were the oldest, and you\u2122d had your Bar Mitzvah. And times were times of duress, I -- which prompted me to think perhaps he was more open in what he said to you.",
            "answer": "Well, but you have to remember that -- th -- it was such a special moment, I -- I cannot conceive of an -- a recollection -- let me back off, very quickly. In the summer of \u212239, my father took me to a -- there\u2122s a -- a place about a hundred kilometers from Athens, it\u2122s called Lutrikey, and it\u2122s a -- sort of a spa, because it has water sources that are -- contain rad-radio activity, radium. And th ey were thought to be very beneficial for whatever a-ails you. It was essentially a resort. And so we went ahead of the rest of the family for three or four days. It was shortly after by -- my Bar Mitzvah, and I still remember the first time that -- so we were the two of us, and is the first instance that I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 11recall my father telling me, for example [indecipherable] personal plans, that he had begun to -- I see -- remember telling me -- put some money aside, and part of plan was we were going to leave the apartment where we had lived for -- since I rec -- I recall. And we\u2122re going to buy a house. So it was th e first time that I had heard my father telling me of something about his -- let\u2122s say dreams and plans for the future. So, in other words, it was the first instance where I think I was tr -- being treated as an adult. The unfortunate thing is that as soon as we returned, the wa r started, in September of \u212239, so we too -- September thir -- or -- or -- or that summer of \u212239, it\u2122s the last summer -- and that in 1940 because the war didn\u2122t touch Greece until the fall of 1940 that are the last two summers that I can recall of being if not happy, at least -- I have to use a French word, insouciance, that we we re not bothered. The war had started, it was a terrible thing. My parents had both gone through the experience of the first World War, and it\u2122s horrors in Monasteer, but it was so far away that it didn\u2122t yet begin to touch us until the fall of 1940. So, it\u2122s a long detour to what\u2122s -- what -- what you ask. So I -- I -- I think there was a tremendous amount of resilience, and strength that -- in my father, which was not apparent on the surface. When he admonished me not to be caught alive by the Germans, I think it was because he knew from all the reports of the 30\u2122s, since the rise of Hitler in Germany, the history of the -- of the Jews in Gaspora, all these things, you know, get farely concentrated, and simply -- al-although I don\u2122t think he -- no one knew at that time of c oncentration camps, but he knew that it was not a good thing to be caught alive by the Germans. So he -- he -- it was a second USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 12instance of I -- his addressing me as an adult, and telling me that it\u2122s better to -- to be dead, than be caught alive."

            "answer": "F -- yo-your absolutely correct about the pall, because it was so palpable, I -- I can still feel it. I don\u2122t re -- recall that there was, let\u2122s say, a smile on their faces after about mid or early April of 1943, because the ne ws began to come in very quickly about both Monasteer and Salonika. Those occur about two or three weeks apart. And the -- although -- sou -- a few things were written up in the papers that was really not -- some that was really spoken, but they knew from reports of relatives.

But even to me, they -- they didn\u2122t say things because they knew that I would have -- I wouldn\u2122t have that much to contribute. But it was -- it was a sort of shielding, but I think it was primarily because they themselves were, first of all, not only so crushed by what they had heard, but the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 13principle thing was that they be -- I\u2122m sure now, in retrospect, that they were mulling what to do in case so -- something like this would reach Athens.

            "answer": "All right. A couple of weeks before the dispersal, a friend of -- a sc-schoolmate -- I -- I would speak about my role first. Although again, I hadn\u2122t discussed this with my parents, but sensing what was happening, this school f-friend, Thanasis Mikalopoulus, who is a Christian Greek, I had told him that there may come a time when I may have to go into hiding, and then -- we were close friends, but I hadn\u2122t even met his parents.

Ne xt door to our house in Athens, to our apartment, was a man who had a small store that was really a mini USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 15variety store.

And that enabled them to collaborate with the Nazis.",
            "answer": "Well yes, but remember, it took quite a bit of time, and quite a bit of history for things of that sort to take place. Look at Bulgaria. In 1941 they pass a law, which has about -- magnificent Orwellian title, the law for the protection of the state. But it was almost patterned -- similar to the Nuremberg laws, and -- and most of it\u2122s provisions USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 16were clearly anti-Semitic.

So, the Germans, by no means had - didn\u2122t have, you know, the exclusive patent to brutality and cruelty. They rose it to -- to heights of subtlety and -- and demonic deviousness. [indecipherable] Salonika Jews, they were telling them that they gonna send them to Krak\u00f3w, and -- and un-unfortunately, the -- the chief rabbi, who was the leader of the community in Salonika was a -- a gullible, na\u00efve, stupid individual, who then tried to reassure the -- th-the Jews of Salonika that their brethren in Kr ak\u00f3w were going to take care of them. Of course, the Germans didn\u2122t tell them that Krak\u00f3w had already been totally eliminated. So this kind of a thing hadn\u2122t reached Gr eece or Italy. Maybe -- I don\u2122t know, maybe the ethnic character, it would never have take n root, but I have to admit that I often think that we have failed miserably, in the last 50 or 60 years. When I was in the mountains we thought that that was going to be the end of this sort of brutality, and one sees it repeated over, and over again, as if these things didn\u2122t happen.

Did you talk to your fa ther about what that stage was like for him?",
            "answer": "The answer is, we didn\u2122t talk, but -- and I again, I surmise that -- l-let\u2122s put some dates, so we -- we -- we will know what we are talking about. My mother and brothers were caught towards the end of June, beginning of July of 1944. They were incarcerated in the detention camp of Hithari. And on July 29, they were put on board the last transport that ever left Greece, t ogether with the 1800 Rhodesian Jews. I can imagine that my father learned about that not because anyone went and told him. There was no such contact, but he must have surmised, because they say from a negative side, lack of contact from time to time, my mother, or Sam would go to my father, not so much alone to see him, but al so to get money. Also, perhaps -- we didn\u2122t USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 21cover that, I don\u2122t believe in the video interview, but I know subsequently, that my father changed hiding places three times, because -- you know, the -- you can only maintain a -- a pretense of a visiting relative up to a certain point, all right? So there would come a time when it was time to go. Some -- ok -- times there were o -- really ostensible reasons that people would su spect, or even somebody would whisper and say -- they begin to s -- to know that you are Jews, whereupon both the family who were doing the sheltering, as well as the sheltered, knew that it was time to -- to move. So my father moved three times. At the time of, I think, the capture of my mother, grandmother and brothers, he -- it was finally in the last place, the third place, before the liberation.

            "answer": "Yes. Yes, this is a -- a -- really a very painful a-aspect to me, because of what Sam told me. In their interrogation, the beatings that my mother and he were subjected -- not the young one, not the me -- Mekko. And they kept on asking them about my father\u2122s and my whereabouts. Of course, in -- in a case for me, she did not know. And then Sam told me that for months, and months, and months, my mother was really destitute, and -- and -- a -- I mean, extremely concerned about what had happened to me. She did not know where I had gone. I\u2122m sure my father told her, \ufb01He\u2122s gone to the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 22mountains.\ufb02 But even with my father I di dn\u2122t com -- there was no way to communicate and -- and send notes from time to time, I\u2122m -- I\u2122m fine.

This -- I mean, either heroism -- you know, that\u2122s un-unthinkable, or foolhardiness, another thing my mother was a foolhardy person.

Yes, because I looked at the da -- the so-called danuta Auschwitz chronicles as they are known, which is entries, almost like a diary every da y of oc-occurrences. And the entry for August 16, it talks about the almost 2000 Rhodesi an Jews. It doesn\u2122t tell the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 27complete story, there were another har -- 600 non-Rhodesian Jews among them, my mother and -- and -- and brothers. They arrived there, and in the -- this of course, famous separation, the re -- the single reason that he was moved to -- towards the labor camp, was because of his height. He was only -- \u212244 -- he was 14 years old, but he was a lot taller than his age, and he also credits the fact that the month detention in Hidari outside of Athens before the transport, wher e he was forced to do stupid, meaningless labor of moving rocks from one place to th e other, had -- and the food was good, also, there, amazing because it was the Red Cross who were feeding them, that he -- he gained enough muscle so that in the separation, he was then pointed to be taken to labor -- all right -- to the labor camp. Once then in the labor camp, after the famous three or four weeks of so-called quarantine, then he was taken to a section of Auschwitz called the boodi, which was a set of farms that were being worked on by a combination of Polish and German farmers, and the inmates were doing the -- the hard labor. But the survival in boodi, in particular then the survival in the famous Death March in the winter of \u212245, when Auschwitz got shut down because of the Russians coming in, and they were taken elsewhere. Sam credits it to the care of older men, who took him, as they did also other, younger kids, under their wings. In particular in protecting them about -- especially what not to do. And what to be a-a-aware of, because as we know, human beings in those circumstances did terrible things to each other, stealing bread, just sort of pure survival .

            "question": "Yeah, anyway, they\u2122re wonderful stories of a father\u2122s determination. Now, at this time, would many of the Jews of Athens ha ve been thinking actively of leaving for either Palestine or the United States?",
            "answer": "Very well -- ah, I -- I saw that questi on, I was laughing a little bit because I have -- I have to tell you what -- what happened. Th ere was not, as in for example, Bulgaria. You know, in spite of all the talk about the Bulgarians saving 50,000 Jews, it\u2122s true that -- that they were not killed, but not what then the Bulgarians began to claim. But the Bulgarians, as you know, marched with their feet, and -- and from 48,000, there are only 3000 left. There was less of the mass ex odus from Greece, but th -- recall also, that out of a population of 77,000 pre-war, only about six or 7000 survived. And I think in one of your questions was how many wer -- were sheltered. The best numbers that one has, about five or 6000 found shelter, either with Greek Christian families, or in the mountains. I don\u2122t mean the resistance, they just went up there, and were able to hide and lose themselves in -- in the population in the parts of Greece that they were known as free Greece, which included the region where I was. About 1300 were the -- in the resistance, in any case. But very shortly -- I mean, mid \u212245, immediately we had visitors from Israel, and I still remember y oung Israelis, but Greek speaking Israelis, but totally different, and -- and darkened from sun, and -- and full of muscle, and -- peasants. I mean, things out there that you don\u2122t necessarily associate with the appearance of -- of -- of Jews, especially those that live in cities who are -- live soft lives. In any case, they had been sent on purpose to recruit young men to come to Israel. And as you know, they did. Quite a few were then sent to what\u2122s called USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 32Akshara, which was sort of a preparatory sch ool for three or four weeks, to teach the rudiments of living in a kibbutz. And then it was -- all of it was clandestine, because one night, in -- at night -- and they were taken by boat to ships that were not in territorial Greek waters, and there they were taken, and then taken to Greece again in secret, because they didn\u2122t come as part of the British quotas, they were trying to violate. And some of them were caught and incarcerated in Cypress, in any case. So I -- I was, and some of my friends, lobbied intensely by the Israelis to come to Palestine, but the reason I\u2122m laughing is -- y-you -- it\u2122s -- I recollect, and -- and I -- I think it\u2122s so unreal. Most of our preoccupation in questi -- questioning the Israelis about what kind of government are we going to have, if ev entually a state is formed. Because our experience, you know, in the mountains, and things like this is we need to be democratic, and you know, almost Socialistic , and things like -- th-the Israelis would look at us as though w-we were nuts, and say, \ufb01Look, w-we have many things to do before w-we come to that point. The first thing to do is to try to -- to make sure that we become a state. When we become a state, then people will ha -- will -- will vote,\ufb02 and -- and we were surely looking for reassurances ahead of time. Well, and that was -- there was a very strong thing. The reason I didn\u2122t become extremely serious, you know, to the point of taking action, what they say -- first of all, A, I couldn\u2122t leave my father. Sam had not even yet appeared on th e scene when these events of the contact with the Israelis occurred. Sam had not e -- yet returned, number one, and two, of course, the Israelis had departed, and then of course the British clamped down, and it wasn\u2122t even possible to do that any more. And then of course, my departure from the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 33United States, you know, made this thing a moot point. But yes, there was a very strong period of I would say two or three months, where prac tically I got on the boat to go to Palestine."

Upon our USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 45return then, to New Jersey, I resumed my work at Bell Laboratories, but then there was a -- a rift, and in 1957, I was divorced."

And was very often sufficient to -- to -- to allow me to buy a -- an occasional movie ticket. Because the scholarship just simply provided room and board, nothing else. But then I had a friend and when finally I wa -- began to start working at Bell Laboratories stationed in New York City, then this friend that I had met in the camp told me about a young lady who was an -- an -- a friend of hers, and that\u2122s how I -- I met Ann. And so we were going out together, and in fact when I got my notice from the draft board to present myself for training, Ann -- I can only tell you subs -- from subsequent information -- her own parents were divorced, it was a -- a rather unhappy marriage, and she convinced me. I maybe n-not have taken a lot of convincing, I was a little bit hesitant because, you know, going into the army, goodness knows where I could be shipped. But she was persuasive enough to tell me that she would accompany me wherever we went, if it [indecipherable] allowed. The long and the short is we -- we got married. And she went to school in Colorado Springs, at the university because she eventually intended to go to medical school. When we return, lived in New Jersey, she enrolled at NYU. And she was -- began to have problems. First of all, academic problems, and then one USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 46day she disappeared. The long and the short is I found out through a physician who was -- knew her from -- since childhood, that according to him, she was a schizophrenic.

I was -- my reaction was, you know, \ufb01You\u2122re just telling me that I\u2122m dealing with a sick person, and you\u2122re telling me to abandon a sick person?\ufb02 But he convinced me that it\u2122s the kind of a thing that has no hope for -- for cure, and -- and it would have been almost an impossibility.

            "answer": "All right, all right. Well, you know, there was always a kind of phrase to describe the Bell system. We used to refer to i -- i -- to it as -- collectively as Mother Bell. So one can conjure up a -- an older woman, rath er buxom, you know. Warm, that you feel warm in -- in -- in -- in -- near her. Well, in other words, it was a magnificent preparation for a career, because first of all you -- you were among individuals of extreme capability. Bell Laboratories recruited only the upper one percent of graduates in American universities. So there were no idiots there, and -- and you couldn\u2122t really make it through with hot air, you would be found out right away.

It isn\u2122t that I didn\u2122t learn things from colleagues, I did, a great d eal. But there was no former -- you were essentially left on your own. And there came times I think almost three or four weeks after I started, that I really had terrible time believing that I was earning my paycheck under false pretenses. That -- that I wasn\u2122t doing anything valuable. But I very quickly got over that, because I began to do serious things. And then I got drafted, and I return, a-and -- and then it happened that we were work ing on the first field trial of this first ever new telephone exchange, what has take n Bell Laboratories biggest department of 400 people, six or seven years to prepare for the field trial in Modess, Illinois.

My analysis showed that it would barely make it for 2000 subscriber s. Well, it was solid enough thing that my own supervisor believed it, and f -- you know, typically then I was -- I gave it a -- a presentation. And of course the first reac tion was one of horribl e shock and -- and -- and -- and -- and disdain, but the stuff was solid enough, and that was -- I became a -- immediately a rising star. I was almost, I think, thrown out into the street, and within a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 48week I became a fair haired boy, and I got promoted, became a first promotion supervisor. But then I got the notion, a year after I became promoted that I really wanted to be in a higher stratum of research, and I left and went to the Rand Corporation in California, where I was going to work, believe it or not, it was a joke, really to [indecipherable] subsequently on artificial intelligence, because two people who had written some papers, told me that they had funding from the Air Force to start an effort, and I wanted to be a participant there.

The enthusiasm there, of going and doing something like this was so [indecipherable] and -- and -- and -- and it -- it encompassed practically hundreds of thousands of engineers, and -- and people around the country. The enthusiasm was -- was great. It has not been replicated. But if USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 51I may tell you that things like this have occu rred, and I can assure you that I have not really been an instrument in choosing the situations, bu t throughout my career, Bell Laboratories, the new telephone system, then the Apollo program, the Rand Corporation artificial intelligence. In other words, what I\u2122m trying to emphasize is that these things occur both in companies as well as in -- even in countries, very rarely, where you undertake something where there is no precedent. Because when you are in situations like this, then ideas flow freely. When you are in a -- in a environment with a lot of tradition, and you say, \ufb01Well, what about this thing?\ufb02 Then they\u2122ll say, \ufb01Look, we\u2122ve tried that.\ufb02 Or, \ufb01We don\u2122t do things like this around here.\ufb02 When you are in a new situation, then all ideas are given free reign.

And the long and the short was that we made a deal, and essentially, I really didn\u2122t even know what, specifically we we re going to do other than to really get into the area of computers, and -- and software, but not concrete ideas. But very quickly after our formation, a couple of fortuitous events occur. The first one was that my former boss at the company that I worked, part of the Bell system that was doing USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 55the work on the Apollo program, the company was called Bellcom, and it was, of course, situated in Washington, that\u2122s what brought us from California here. He also had, later on, a year after I left, had moved on to other things, had become chief executive of another company. And he calle d me on the phone one day, and he said that one of the -- the subsidiaries, who were doing work in -- around the country, they were -- in fact they had almost a virtual monopoly of race track systems. That is to say those systems where they display the odds, and also people go into the windows and bet. But that company, the subsidiary, had started an attempt to computerize their totes, as they were called, it\u2122s also the same name in England, from tote boards. And we -- we -- could we go and -- and see about their plans? So we thought that it was going to be a brief engagement of about a coup le of months to look over their plans. It turned out to be a six or seven year affair, because when we reviewed their plans, and - and -- and we are -- we told them not only what was done wrong, but how to do it right, they said, \ufb01Well, why don\u2122t you do it for us?\ufb02 And the long and the short is, and what made my company was the horses. We -- we build the first computerized systems in the world, and it was really yeah -- to some extent a technological innovation because we used mini-computers, which were just beginning to come into -- into play, primarily as laboratory instruments. No -- no such animal had ever been used in a very, not only real life situation, but betting is a very, very technologically demanding situation, because in the half hour period between races, where all the betting\u2122s taking place, the number of transactions is very, very high.

And then I said, naively, \ufb01Are you related?\ufb02 They said, \ufb01We are sisters.\ufb02 Well, so that was our first meeting. Then the following day, or I di -- two da ys later, I forget, she called, and now she tells me that this was a daring thing on her part, to tell me that she had tickets to a concert with Isaac Stern, would I like to go? I said, \ufb01Of course.\ufb02 I had dinner with Isaac Stern during my years -- in fact, we went to the concert and after the concert I went backstage, and we had a little reunion with Stern.

I -- I -- she invited me to give lectures in -- in Baltimore in July, which I will do. But I just heard a lecture of hers because of the -- of a thing in the National Cathedral where they have some artifacts that came from Spain that -- of the Sephardim Jews there. Wonderful lecture she gave. And a magnificent phrase of hers, I think it was in response to a question, and -- and her phrase was, the relative relaxed attitude of the Sephardim towards religion. And this is as best I can also describe both my religious upbringing, which was not very strict. I m ean, we were observant of all the major holiday -- Jewish holidays.

But some of the things we retained which were dear to me, primarily because it brought memories of the family and it\u2122s tradition.

But I did not insist on their going to Sunday school, or -- or -- or this or the othe r. It\u2122s -- it\u2122s turned out that of the three, entirely spontaneously, Nicole is the one who is super Jewish than all the other -- all -- all the -- the daughters. I think really if I th ink now in retrospect, I think the division of labor in the upbringing was -- Paulette was much more -- her family more structured USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 72from a social standpoint.

Plus I think something else, one other thing, it was -- this -- how can I phrase it? The -- the -- the a -- assuming of personal responsibility. I remember that in the case of all three girls, when they were ready to now leave home and go to school -- to university, Maya -- Sarah going to Boston, Maya in Michigan, and Nicole in Wisconsin, I took them all for a -- a long ride and lunch.

It\u2122s -- it\u2122s then that I began to realize how much what was, I thought, unfair, then was responsible for getting a certain amount of self discipline, and which in the beginning is a chore, then eventually becomes something that you like, namely to go and find out things.

Unlike physics, or -- or science where you may have an idea but then it needs to be corroborated by physical observation, experiment. Which is then half wasted because it requires both intellect and observation, to then maki ng things, which is entirely by hands, although it requires also some training, which obviously involves the brain. So I -- from those early things then, I wanted to build things. And so when we went to California for the first time, I bought a saw, a table saw, and drills, and began to work with wood because I remember how this craftsman was able to transform -- which is almost the equivalent of the Michelangelo statement that he does not make statues, he just removes the amount of marble, and just reve als what\u2122s already there."

            "answer": "All right, so -- so -- so -- wha -- you asked me what I like to do for pleasure, and part of it was, when I was at Bell Laboratories for example, then I belonged to a Bridge playing club, and i -- some of us at lunch hour, instead of going to the cafeteria to have lunch, would have a sandwich, take it with us, and go to the recreation room, and -- and play Bridge until the -- and so very quickly, and especially in Bridge as well as in chess, you have to have good tutors, especially wish have -- to have very good partners. I was able to gain 1800 master points, because we were starting to -- playing in tournaments. At the Rand Corporation, I got involved -- a very favory game, is -- it was -- it\u2122s called Krikspiel, which is the German for war game, Krikspiel. This is a -- a -- a game with the following. It\u2122s essentially chess, and instead of a single board, there USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 84are two boards, with a wall in between the two players. So both boards are set independently, and each player does not see what the other\u2122s board contains. And the moves start. There is an observer, who sees both boards, and whose role is only to say whether a move that you may attempt is perm issible or not. Permissible in the sense if there\u2122s an opponent piece, you cannot move, le t\u2122s say, a square ahead, all right? And his other role is to say whether you have ca ptured a piece. That\u2122s the only thing he\u2122s permitted to say. And the whole notion is that you fight a war when you really don\u2122t know the deployment of the opponent forces. Now, as you proceed with the game, and pieces start getting a -- to be eliminated through capture, and the -- the board thins out, you begin to have a pretty good idea what it is. So these are the things which are intellectual games that -- that -- that attracted me. But inc -- we moved to California, I bought a saw, and I started make -- making things. Making things out of wood, then when we came here I made the table which I showed you upstairs. I made some other pieces. But now I don\u2122t do these things any more, now it -- it\u2122s -- a new toy has come into my life, and that\u2122s th-the -- the computer, and making web sites, and things like this.

All right. First of all, I was asked by my former boss to consult for another year for the company, because there was still a piece of work that I had USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 86started, that was unfinished, and he was not planning to replace my position. So I did that for a year. Then, coincidentally a friend of mine, a Greek who was working for the European community, asked me and told me that they needed consultants for work which was being funded by the Europe an community, but which dealt with telecommunications, and it\u2122s future in Gr eece. I mean the telecommunication system. So for four years, I traveled. I was practically on the plane every other month, through Europe, throughout Europe. I -- I\u2122m no -- I\u2122m talking about the east, but primarily the western part of Europe, and Greece, doing this consulting work. Then a year after that, a big project that I started had come to a reasonable stopping point , and we had had the Irish telecommunications compa ny, that which led me to go to Ireland a number of times, which I -- both Paulette and I love.

So there\u2122s a -- a lot of progeny that\u2122s -- that\u2122s now in -- in the tents.

            "answer": "-- and eventually it was published, and they are known as the Danuta Chronicles. Well, you look at entries day by day as they -- they are there. Sometimes they are from the sublime or the horrible, to the terribl y mundane. For instance, okay, today 15,000 arrived and were taken to the crematoria. And then this individual was punished with 10 lashes because he stole a piece of bread. I mean, these are the kinds of extremes of entries. Well, all right. Since I knew the approximate period, then I find an entry for 16 August of \u212244, where he says, \ufb011600 or 2000 Rhodesian Jews come.\ufb02 Then he says how -- so many males, so many females. Not of the total, but so many females were given numbers, and he has the range of th e numbers, and the females were given the following numbers. And I kn ew from Sam\u2122s number on his arm fits exactly in the range that he\u2122s -- he cited there. So I know now that the date of the arrival, and when I asked Sam at what time of the day they arrived, he said, \ufb01Very early, dawn.\ufb02 And that makes me conclude that either they -- they were executed or -- or gassed the same day, because they didn\u2122t keep them around, or at the latest, the following day. So that was the first thing. So I -- I did a little bit more of this personal kind of a thing. What drove me then to the later engagement, which would -- then became intense, was a similar thing. I always -- I -- although I knew the fate of my relatives in Macedonia, in mon -- in Monasteer, but especially in s -- in s -- the Serbian Jews, in Serbia, very few ever reached the concentration camps. And now not that much had been written, so I was beginning to get really curious, so I began to -- to read some sources. Now I know the Germans shot most of the Serbian Jews and buried them, or used mobile gas vans. It USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 90was before the killing factories began to operate. Well, then I found in a book that the Bulgarians who occupied Ma cedonia and Phrase, among ot her things, and -- and this book which is called, \ufb01A Town called Monasteer,\ufb02 makes the following assertion. That in the archives of Yad Vashem, there is a unique -- a -- o -- a -- an item unique to the Holocaust. But emphatically I\u2122ve concluded there is nothing unique about the Holocaust, everything is uniqu e about the Holocaust. And so I contacted Yad Vashem, eventually I got the microfilm, it came. But then, while I\u2122m waiting for that, I thought I would to go the archives, and I asked Shar on there innocently, do you have anything from Monasteer? Yes, we have 1400 photographs. Well, here is two huge books, but you couldn\u2122t -- th-they were just only photographs with numbers, no identification. But together there was two rolls of 35 millim eter microfilm, so you take the books to the library, put the -- thread the thing in the reader, and every frame has the same number as the photograph, and written in handwritten Cy rillic was the identity and address of these persons. Well, very quickly, the first day, I advance the microfilm to my relatives. Now though, since it\u2122s Cyrillic the first letter is k, then comes n, and at the end is f. There\u2122s Colonomos from my mother\u2122s brother, I found my aunt. My uncle Salamone Hamma, my father\u2122s brother, and my father\u2122s sister, Oro, who had married a man named Franco. Well, I took copies of it, I -- I came home. I was a bit moved by this discovery. Okay, marvelous things over the weekend, and then the following Monday I called the archives, and it was Sharon, she says, \ufb01Well, Mr. Nehama, you know, we wanted to call you, but I was hesi tating, and,\ufb02 -- I said, \ufb01Look, let me tell you why I\u2122m calling. Since I was able to read about my [indecipherable] perhaps USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 91maybe I can help.\ufb02 She said, \ufb01That\u2122s what we were going to ask you too, if you would be willing to.\ufb02 And that\u2122s what got me started, and -- and that -- that initial piece of work took almost a year, because now, for th e first six months, I would go the museum carrying my portable computer, and get the bo oks, get the microfilm, sit in front of a reader, and as I read -- and some of these things are sometimes unreadable, I would then transfer them to the computer. Then one day it dawned on me that instead of trudging and getting all these things to the museum, maybe I would rent a microfilm reader, and bring it here to my house, and I don\u2122t have to -- to travel. But immediately then I thought, there is a button on the microfilm reader, and if you press it, it gives you a copy out of the printer. Well, that means that the stupid th ing goes out digitally so that the printer can print it. If it goes out to the printer, it can sure go to a CD. So I took the -- the microfilm, and I paid a co -- a company, and they transferred onto -- on one -- on a CD, so I did the remaining other four or five months at home. Then after that was finished, the -- the archives, the photo archives, I did the same thing with the Yad Vashem register, which is even more difficult, because, you know, even if you magnify, it begins to get distorted, but I can show you later, you can even see that different clerks were writing, because yo u can see that the handwriting is changing over time. And it -- it was a-another almost ei ght or nine months of very eye breaking e-e-effort to -- to do the Yad Vashem thing. But it was --"

The truth is that it requires a little bit more sophistication, although children gras p things much more quickly, because they don\u2122t carry terrible baggage that they have to discard first. But there are certain aspects of special relativity that one has to be able to at least make a leap of [indecipherable] because one thing to which special relativity is key, namely the velocity of light, we cannot experience it. You can only think about it, and the -- in fact there have been books that tell you, supposing the velocity of light was not what it is.

But there were also some byproducts, if I can call them, which really would last a lot longer, because in the process I came into contact with individuals of similar interests. There\u2122s a matter of me corresponding with -- his name is Moses Hasson, he lives in Santiago, Chile, because the people from Monasteer were early settlers in 1916 in a small town called Temooko, in the lake district in Chile. And -- and was one of the oldest Sephardic as well as monastilee communities in South America. Then I -- I met -- and I have not met yet in person, a man who wrote a book about Monasteer, his name is Mark Cohen, he lives in San Francisco area. And it was through Mark\u2122s researchers that I found, and I fe -- I have copies now of reasons the s -- s -- the declaration of 16 prominent Mo-Monasteer Jews, among them my great-grandfather Solomon, to establish the alliance fran\u00e7aise in -- in Monasteer. Then in 1924, my grandfather, Isaac, whose name I bear, was the president of the Monasteer communit -- the Jewish community of Monasteer, and we have a facsimile of his letter from Yale, in Yale, where\u2122s he\u2122s addressing the illion israllitany versell in Paris, thanking them for the donations of clothing and money to the Jews of Monasteer who had been severely -- suffered through fierce bombardment during the first World War, to almost the total destruction of Jewish homes. Then -- then my uncle Solomon was the secretary of the Joint Distribution Committee in USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 96Monasteer, thanking the Jews of America for a shipment of clothing. All of that, in addition to being gratifying that -- that I -- I -- I have some lineage of people who gave something to the community, which reminded me of a thing my father would tell me when I was growing up, that human beings, in their infancy, for self preservation are very selfish. They don\u2122t think about anybody else. Then they go to school, they meet other people, so they begin to share. When they have a family, they begin to give to others. But some people stop there. Now, very few people begin to give to a larger circle, namely their immediate community. Still fewer give to even larger circle, the country to which they belong. And finally, extremely few, maybe one in million, give to the entire world.
