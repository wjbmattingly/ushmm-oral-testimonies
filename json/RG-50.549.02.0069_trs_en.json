This is an interview with Isaac Nehama, conducted by Margaret West on June the second, 2003, in Bethesda, Maryland. This interview is part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\u2019s post-Holocaust interview project, and is a follow-up interview to a USHMM videotaped interview conducted with Isaac Nehama on October the 22\", 2002. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A.",
            "answer": "My name is Isaac Nehama. I was born in Athens, Greece, April 29, ninetweent-- 1926. I returned to Athens from the partisans. I was stationed at that time in Thessaly, in the city of Lireza, which 1s the capital of Thessaly. I returned to Athens t -- either towards the very end of October, \u201944, or beginning of November \u201944. Approximately two or three weeks after the liberation of Greece -- actually, the Germans left Greece because the Russians were about to enter Yugoslavia, and therefore their retreat would have been cut off. So the Germans essentially left Greece."

            "answer": "Well, I arrived in Athens on, I remember, a Sunday. And the reason this 1s prominent, because I think Sundays everywhere in the world are very quiet days, sometimes they are deserted. I arrived in Athens f -- with a bus that I had taken from Lireza perhaps around four or five o\u2019clock in the afternoon. I called from the bus This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection station, and I was told to immediately come. I took a taxi, and when finally we were approaching our neighborhood, and my house, I expected to be greeted in the street by my two younger brothers, but I saw no one. In fact, there was not a single person in the street. And I walked up to our apartment, I rang the door. A woman came out, who I recognized to be the woman whom I had seen in t -- in Lireza two weeks or so previously, who had told me that she had been passing through, and she had a message from my family, they were, all of them anxious, waiting to -- to be reunited with me, and she was the one who even gave me money for the -- for the fare back. Of course, I- I now know, and -- or soon learned that my father had given her the money to -- to give me for the fare. In any case -- so she -- she s -- immediately, without even -- I think she didn\u2019t even say a -- any words, but simply with a finger pointed upstairs to the apartment of our pre-war neighbors, a family called Shabitai. I didn\u2019t know what to make of it, why would I have to go to the Shabitai\u2019s to see my family? So I went one more flight, and I knocked on the door, and Mrs. Shabitai opened the door, and she embraced me, and I was shown into their living room, and then I saw my father, and only my father, with Mr. Shabitai. I -- I -- we embraced, and I immediately asked where 1s mother, and -- and -- and Sam, and -- and Mekko, as we used to call the youngest brother. And my father was crying, and I think un-unable to explain, and Mr. mi -- Shabitai said that th-they were not there, they were -- they were caught, but that that wasn\u2019t the time to explain. They implied that I must have known that terrible things happen, and that my mother and brothers were caught, and no one knows -- knew where they went. That was the -- the reunion.

            "question": "Tell me how you proceeded from -- from that im -- immediate reunion, to beginning to plan where you would live, and how you would put your lives together?",
            "answer": "Yeah, but I have to -- to cover 1v -- the brai -- brief period that occurred about two weeks after my arrival. I -- in -- in the beginning of December of \u00b044, there was a brief civil war between the left -- political left, and the government, and also the British forces in Athens. And these troubles primarily occurred in Athens. There -- there was fighting in the street, and all of us were sort of hiding to try to avoid being injured. Then, in about 15 days after the start of the troubles -- I s -- even then we called it the events, our neighborhood was liberated, and as I recall by a small group of English parachutists, I remember their red berets. So that was the beginning of what I thought was going to be normalcy, but very quickly, two days later, I was standing in line to buy some food, which was unavailable, and I was arrested by Greek gendarmes, taken, interrogated. They wanted me to reveal names of known leftists. I explained to them I had been gone for slightly over a year, I knew nobody, I was not politically active. But it -- nevertheless, I was -- I was taken in a c -- little camp out -- out -- outside of Athens, and eventually to Africa. But very shortly, through the intervention of relatives, I was freed, and came back. So I think it was, essentially in the beginning of 45 that we even began to even think about the restoration of our lives. Since as soon as I finish high school in 1942, the universities were closed, and I couldn\u2019t go on, and my father had resumed his occupa -- work with -- he was chief accountant of a large textile firm in Athens. So he resumed hi-his -- his profession. Also, I must note that the apar -- our apartment in Athens, where we lived before, a -- a couple, a husband and a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They were occupying half of the apartment, they couldn\u2019t be evicted, or -- or -- 1t was out of the question to -- to -- to -- to -- to take any action. So my father and I sort of lived in half of the apartment, until about six or eight months later, after Sam returned, Mr. and Mrs. Stasinopolous, that was their name, eventually left, and went, and found another - another apartment. So immediately I -- I then began getting preparations for taking the entrance exam to the Polytechnic Institute in Athens, which I -- this usually took place in the end of August, beginning of September. And indeed, in -- in September of \"45, I took the exams, and I was admitted, and I -- I had one semester in the Polytechnic Institute, before I had found out -- which we perhaps will go into in -- ina moment, that my father had begun to, without telling me a word, working assiduously to find a way for me to study all -- abroad, which he eventually was successful, and -- but that\u2019s ano -- a different chapter."

            "question": "Yes. When you were a teenager, you had been working. What was the work that you were doing then, and you were doing it until 1943?",
            "answer": "Well, I -- I -- I -- as I said, I finished high school in June of \u201942. Since the universities were closed, then it was unthinkable, I think, for my father and mother that I would simply remain idle. So I was -- my father found a job for me. Let me describe it as being the clandestine, or an illegal market in currency. There was a -- not a black market, but a clandestine market of currency in -- in -- in Greece during the occupation. What was exchanged were principally, and almost exclusively, gold coins, either British sovereigns, French gold francs, or Swiss francs. Occasionally -- and the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And also, occasionally, small bars of gold. So, this individual, who was originally from Salonika, and who was a -- in the stock market in Salonika, the legal stock market, he had, with his family, escaped from Salonika, established himself in Athens, and then started a -- an office by himself. A bureau conducting this sort of activity. Very briefly, the way it worked, if somebody wanted to, let\u2019s say sell or buy gold coins, against drachmas -- because drachma of course was, in the occupation, highly devalued. The -- the value of -- th -- the price fluctuated according to the political fortunes of the allies. For instance, while Rommel was advancing in North Africa, then the pound, and the dollar -- or the gold pound and the dollar, would then be def -- deflated. And when, on the contrary, when the allies began to -- to -- to -- to -- t -- to win, and turn the tide around, then the -- the- the drachma would be more highly valued, because it would have s-some value other than what the piece of paper that was the currency during the occupation. So this is what, essentially, he was doing. And my job was -- I didn\u2019t do the trades, but I had to deliver to a buyer, or -- a f -- f -- first of all, even to deliver a roll of let\u2019s say, 10 gold sovereigns to the buyer, I had to go first to the seller, to his house, get the roll of coins, put them in my pocket, and deliver them to the -- to the buyer. It was, let\u2019s say, a dangerous activity because possession, let alone trade in gold, was illegal. If I had been caught, I -- I would have been jailed, shot, or whatever it was. Even conducting this sort of business was -- was illegal. So there was a f -- the front was that -- there we- we had a number of shelves in the office with textiles.

Both of them are what is referred to as Romaniots, which can be explained either as Greek speaking, or negatively, non-Ladino, not Judeo espanole speaking, or they were not descendants of the Jews who were expelled from Spain in 1492. In contrast, my parents on both sides -- both of them were born in Monasteer, traced their ancestry to the Sephardim who left Spain, and eventually ended up in that part of the Balkans, which was, at that time, a part of the Ottoman Empire."

They all have, perhaps the same kind of Mediterranean look, which not even -- has even particularly darker skin coloration. Of course, a -- a -- you -- you -- you would find very rarely, even among Greeks, or -- or Turks, or southern Italians, or Spanish, blonde people. But there were a few there, but otherwise there were no such characteristics of Sephardim. The thing that was distinguishing, of course was that my parents spoke Ladino to each other, and my maternal grandmother, who would come and visit us, at least two or three times a week, she lived with an aunt- a sister of my mother\u2019s, that\u2019s the only language that she understood, and we had to speak to her, and she spoke to us with s -- Ladino."

Do you have a sense of what gave him strength, and what his state of mind was?",
            "answer": "I can only surmise -- I -- I have to -- because this -- it occurs, and I think about it very often. Or in discussions I have with people. And I always have to remind myself and my interlocutors that at least in those times, and -- and in -- in that particular part of the world, parents were not really very communicative about personal and intimate things, with y-young children. I -- I -- I think -- I -- I -- Ica -- I recollect from cousins that they began to have conversation as between adults, and equals with their parents, after they themselves had matured, and were married. So I don\u2019t think that there was, let\u2019s say, reluctance. My father used to be a great storyteller, but I must say that very seldom, o-o-other than in passing he would say how dinner was in -- on -- on high holidays in Monasteer, how the dinner would be prepared, and things like this. A episode of things like this. But not very much about personal life. But coming back to your question, there was very little exchange between us as to either how we felt -- I told him about some of the things that I had thought about during my sojourn in the Greek mountains with the partisans, but really very briefly, and I think mostly superficial. We didn\u2019t go into -- into that. Knowing my father as I recollect him, he was an individual of -- you know, he was lame, as you know, because of polio, and he had a club foot. So he was always hobbled. He always wor -- wor -- walked with a cane. But he -- he had a -- an inner strength that became evident to me very rarely.

We- remember the war was not over in Europe until April -- end of April \u201945, so the pictures of -- and -- and -- and stories, and -- and things about like the horrors of the camps was still totally unknown. So there was a -- a -- a residue of hope, although very, very slight, that they mi -- they might come back. And the focus, therefore, was I think a -- a tacit -- a mutual understanding that we had to get on with our lives as best we could, and so my father resumed his work, and I then resumed the preparations for taking the exams."

And I think he spoke of that, I\u2019m assuming, because you had shown your determination not to go into hiding, but to go to the mountains. And you were the oldest, and you\u2019d had your Bar Mitzvah. And times were times of duress, I -- which prompted me to think perhaps he was more open in what he said to you.",
            "answer": "Well, but you have to remember that -- th -- it was such a special moment, I -- I cannot conceive of an -- a recollection -- let me back off, very quickly. In the summer of \u00b039, my father took me to a -- there\u2019s a -- a place about a hundred kilometers from Athens, it\u2019s called Lutrikey, and it\u2019s a -- sort of a spa, because it has water sources that are -- contain rad-radio activity, radium. And they were thought to be very beneficial for whatever a-ails you. It was essentially a resort. And so we went ahead of the rest of the family for three or four days. It was shortly after by -- my Bar Mitzvah, and I still remember the first time that -- so we were the two of us, and is the first instance that I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And we\u2019re going to buy a house. So it was the first time that I had heard my father telling me of something about his -- let\u2019s say dreams and plans for the future. So, in other words, it was the first instance where I think I was tr -- being treated as an adult. The unfortunate thing is that as soon as we returned, the war started, in September of \u00b039, so we too -- September thir -- or -- or -- or that summer of \u201939, it\u2019s the last summer -- and that in 1940 because the war didn\u2019t touch Greece until the fall of 1940 that are the last two summers that I can recall of being if not happy, at least -- I have to use a French word, insouciance, that we were not bothered. The war had started, it was a terrible thing. My parents had both gone through the experience of the first World War, and it\u2019s horrors in Monasteer, but it was so far away that it didn\u2019t yet begin to touch us until the fall of 1940. So, it\u2019s a long detour to what\u2019s -- what -- what you ask. So | -- I -- I think there was a tremendous amount of resilience, and strength that -- in my father, which was not apparent on the surface. When he admonished me not to be caught alive by the Germans, I think 1t was because he knew from all the reports of the 30\u2019s, since the rise of Hitler in Germany, the history of the -- of the Jews in Gaspora, all these things, you know, get farely concentrated, and simply -- al-although I don\u2019t think he -- no one knew at that time of concentration camps, but he knew that 1t was not a good thing to be caught alive by the Germans.

Although again, I hadn\u2019t discussed this with my parents, but sensing what was happening, this school f-friend, Thanasis Mikalopoulus, who is a Christian Greek, I had told him that there may come a time when I may have to go into hiding, and then -- we were close friends, but I hadn\u2019t even met his parents.

Well, not suddenly, you know, a whole -- a whole family. So, this person was essential. My father went and -- and stayed for a certain period of time.

Both the man and the -- the -- the woman -- his name was Tenasias, her name was Ellie, they were both working in the same company that my father did, so they were both colleagues, as well as friends of long-standing.

My mother and brothers were caught towards the end of June, beginning of July of 1944. They were incarcerated in the detention camp of Hithari.

They arrived there, and in the -- this of course, famous separation, the re -- the single reason that he was moved to -- towards the labor camp, was because of his height. He was only -- \u201944 -- he was 14 years old, but he was a lot taller than his age, and he also credits the fact that the month detention in Hidari outside of Athens before the transport, where he was forced to do stupid, meaningless labor of moving rocks from one place to the other, had -- and the food was good, also, there, amazing because it was the Red Cross who were feeding them, that he -- he gained enough muscle so that in the separation, he was then pointed to be taken to labor -- all right -- to the labor camp. Once then in the labor camp, after the famous three or four weeks of so-called quarantine, then he was taken to a section of Auschwitz called the boodi, which was a set of farms that were being worked on by a combination of Polish and German farmers, and the inmates were doing the -- the hard labor. But the survival in boodi, in particular then the survival in the famous Death March in the winter of \u201945, when Auschwitz got shut down because of the Russians coming in, and they were taken elsewhere. Sam credits it to the care of older men, who took him, as they did also other, younger kids, under their wings. In particular in protecting them about -- especially what not to do. And what to be a-a-aware of, because as we know, human beings in those circumstances did terrible things to each other, stealing bread, just sort of pure survival.

About 1300 were the -- in the resistance, in any case. But very shortly -- I mean, mid \u201945, immediately we had visitors from Israel, and I still remember young Israelis, but Greek speaking Israelis, but totally different, and -- and darkened from sun, and -- and full of muscle, and -- peasants. I mean, things out there that you don\u2019t necessarily associate with the appearance of -- of -- of Jews, especially those that live in cities who are -- live soft lives.

So I - I was, and some of my friends, lobbied intensely by the Israelis to come to Palestine, but the reason I\u2019m laughing 1s -- y-you -- it\u2019s -- I recollect, and -- and I -- I think it\u2019s so unreal.

Because our experience, you know, in the mountains, and things like this is we need to be democratic, and you know, almost Socialistic, and things like -- th-the Israelis would look at us as though w-we were nuts, and say, \u201cLook, w-we have many things to do before w-we come to that point.

In other words, what I\u2019m trying to emphasize is that these things occur both in companies as well as 1n -- even in countries, very rarely, where you undertake something where there is no precedent. Because when you are in situations like this, then ideas flow freely. When you are in a -- 1n a environment with a lot of tradition, and you say, \u201cWell, what about this thing?\u201d Then they\u2019ll say, \u201cLook, we ve tried that.\u201d Or, \u201cWe don\u2019t do things like this around here.\u201d When you are in a new situation, then all ideas are given free reign. Now, all of them are not equally good, and some could be good, or even better than what was -- which -- which was in, but even countries don\u2019t have the luxury of pursuing two or three avenues in parallel. So to be in a -- in -- in a -- in a -- in an environment like this, it\u2019s the -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s almost like getting drunk, or smoking -- which I don\u2019t know what smoking pot or any of these things would be, but it\u2019s -- I remember the early 50\u2019s in the Bell Laboratories.

He told me one day that his friend was looking to fund a starting company, was I -- was I interested? And the long and the short was that we made a deal, and essentially, I really didn\u2019t even know what, specifically we were going to do other than to really get into the area of computers, and -- and software, but not concrete ideas. But very quickly after our formation, a couple of fortuitous events occur.

He also had, later on, a year after I left, had moved on to other things, had become chief executive of another company. And he called me on the phone one day, and he said that one of the -- the subsidiaries, who were doing work in -- around the country, they were -- in fact they had almost a virtual monopoly of race track systems. That is to say those systems where they display the odds, and also people go into the windows and bet. But that company, the subsidiary, had started an attempt to computerize their totes, as they were called, it\u2019s also the same name in England, from tote boards. And we -- we -- could we go and -- and see about their plans? So we thought that 1t was going to be a brief engagement of about a couple of months to look over their plans. It turned out to be a six or seven year affair, because when we reviewed their plans, and - and -- and we are -- we told them not only what was done wrong, but how to do it right, they said, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you do it for us?\u201d And the long and the short is, and what made my company was the horses. We -- we build the first computerized systems in the world, and it was really yeah -- to some extent a technological innovation because we used mini-computers, which were just beginning to come into -- into play, primarily as laboratory instruments. No -- no such animal had ever been used in a very, not only real life situation, but betting 1s a very, very technologically demanding situation, because in the half hour period between races, where all the betting\u2019s taking place, the number of transactions is very, very high.

So, you know, there were -- there -- there were -- there were tensions at times, and she was, you know, quite severe with me. And it isn\u2019t that she neglected the other two, but I think, again, 1t was a question of mellowing, and -- and not asking as much from them as I did -- she did with me. But on the other hand, especially in the mountains, when I began to reflect about the tensions, and her demands, and things like this. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s then that I began to realize how much what was, I thought, unfair, then was responsible for getting a certain amount of self discipline, and which in the beginning is a chore, then eventually becomes something that you like, namely to go and find out things. And -- and the joy of discovering coutch sa -- doesn\u2019t happen if you don\u2019t -- 1f you don\u2019t try. And -- and you know that there are people I -- I know my youngest daughter began -- she had a -- she has perfect pitch, and began to even play tunes in piano when she was barely two, two and a half years old. And -- and later on -- I tell her sometimes, and she -- she rightly says it isn\u2019t- wasn\u2019t laziness, she had other things to interest her. So she didn\u2019t pursue piano the way, you know, I thought that she -- she would from -- from that kind of promise in the beginning.

            "answer": "Right. Well, again, you know, it\u2019s amazing how inconsequential events remain. I ha- was about six or seven years old, or maybe eight, and I had become a boy scout, or - or a cub scout, whatever it is. And part of -- of the thing was to get a uniform, but also a staff. You know, the kind of a thing that you have to then use when you climb mountains and so on. Well, when the time came for me to -- to -- to get the staff, you d- you couldn\u2019t go to a store and buy it, but next door, or two doors down from my house was a -- a lumberyard. I -- I went and -- and -- and bought a -- a long, square pole, but now it has to be made into a cylinder. Well, it happened then again that another two doors down was, in the basement, a -- a -- a man who used to make chairs, and he had a wooden lathe what he would turn, as the phrase goes, you know, the -- the -- the legs. And so I t -- I brought the -- that square piece of wood, and he made me wait, and was sit down, and he put it on the lathe. And then he began to explain to me while he\u2019s turning the wood, how this essentially amorphous piece of wood, just a square, long, piece of wood, with his cutter, he would be able to transform it and give it shape. So it -- it was like seeing something be revealed under the hands of a -- of a craftsman in front of my eyes. So then the idea of making things with the hands, is a compliment to the -- the other side of pleasure and discovery, which in -- in -- in mathematics does not require proo -- evidence to the physical world. If you solve a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

You don\u2019t need somebody to come and say yes, that\u2019s right, you know it. Unlike physics, or -- or science where you may have an idea but then it needs to be corroborated by physical observation, experiment. Which 1s then half wasted because it requires both intellect and observation, to then making things, which is entirely by hands, although it requires also some training, which obviously involves the brain. So I -- from those early things then, I wanted to build things. And so when we went to California for the first time, I bought a saw, a table saw, and drills, and began to work with wood because I remember how this craftsman was able to transform -- which is almost the equivalent of the Michelangelo statement that he does not make statues, he just removes the amount of marble, and just reveals what\u2019s already there."

I was able to gain 1800 master points, because we were starting to -- playing in tournaments. At the Rand Corporation, I got involved -- a very favory game, 1s -- it was -- it\u2019s called Krikspiel, which is the German for war game, Krikspiel. This is a -- a- a game with the following. It\u2019s essentially chess, and instead of a single board, there This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection are two boards, with a wall in between the two players. So both boards are set independently, and each player does not see what the other\u2019s board contains. And the moves start. There is an observer, who sees both boards, and whose role 1s only to say whether a move that you may attempt is permissible or not. Permissible in the sense if there\u2019s an opponent piece, you cannot move, let\u2019s say, a square ahead, all right? And his other role is to say whether you have captured a piece. That\u2019s the only thing he\u2019s permitted to say. And the whole notion is that you fight a war when you really don\u2019t know the deployment of the opponent forces. Now, as you proceed with the game, and pieces start getting a -- to be eliminated through capture, and the -- the board thins out, you begin to have a pretty good idea what it 1s. So these are the things which are intellectual games that -- that -- that attracted me. But inc -- we moved to California, I bought a saw, and I started make -- making things. Making things out of wood, then when we came here I made the table which I showed you upstairs. I made some other pieces. But now I don\u2019t do these things any more, now it -- it\u2019s -- a new toy has come into my life, and that\u2019s th-the -- the computer, and making web sites, and things like this.

So I did that for a year. Then, coincidentally a friend of mine, a Greek who was working for the European community, asked me and told me that they needed consultants for work which was being funded by the European community, but which dealt with telecommunications, and it\u2019s future in Greece. I mean the telecommunication system. So for four years, I traveled. I was practically on the plane every other month, through Europe, throughout Europe. I -- \u2019'm no -- I\u2019m talking about the east, but primarily the western part of Europe, and Greece, doing this consulting work. Then a year after that, a big project that I started had come to a reasonable stopping point, and we had had the Irish telecommunications company, that which led me to go to Ireland a number of times, which I -- both Paulette and I love. Then we went to Israel. I have lots of relatives there, who had migrated -- some of them migrated in the early 30\u2019s from Salonika to Israel. So there\u2019s a -- a lot of progeny that\u2019s -- that\u2019s now in -- in the tents. Plus also some cousins, among them Miriam, her last name is Kalahora, who was one of about an estimated 1500 Jews who were able to escape from Greece via boat to Turkey, and then go from Turkey, through Syria, and Lebanon, eventually to Palestine. Now some of them, and her sister, either -- I mean, drowned, that\u2019s for sure. What 1s not known is whether they were drowned by the boatman to take their money and -- and essentially kill them.

Sometimes they are from the sublime or the horrible, to the terribly mundane. For instance, okay, today 15,000 arrived and were taken to the crematoria. And then this individual was punished with 10 lashes because he stole a piece of bread. I mean, these are the kinds of extremes of entries. Well, all right. Since I knew the approximate period, then I find an entry for 16 August of \u201944, where he says, \u201c1600 or 2000 Rhodesian Jews come.\u201d Then he says how -- so many males, so many females. Not of the total, but so many females were given numbers, and he has the range of the numbers, and the females were given the following numbers. And I knew from Sam\u2019s number on his arm fits exactly in the range that he\u2019s -- he cited there. So I know now that the date of the arrival, and when I asked Sam at what time of the day they arrived, he said, \u201cVery early, dawn.\u201d And that makes me conclude that either they -- they were executed or -- or gassed the same day, because they didn\u2019t keep them around, or at the latest, the following day. So that was the first thing. So I -- I did a little bit more of this personal kind of a thing. What drove me then to the later engagement, which would -- then became intense, was a similar thing. I always -- I -- although I knew the fate of my relatives in Macedonia, in mon -- in Monasteer, but especially in s -- in s -- the Serbian Jews, in Serbia, very few ever reached the concentration camps. And now not that much had been written, so I was beginning to get really curious, so I began to -- to read some sources.

Well, then I found in a book that the Bulgarians who occupied Macedonia and Phrase, among other things, and -- and this book which is called, \u201cA Town called Monasteer,\u201d makes the following assertion. That in the archives of Yad Vashem, there is a unique -- a -- 0 -- a -- an item unique to the Holocaust. But emphatically Pve concluded there is nothing unique about the Holocaust, everything is unique about the Holocaust. And so I contacted Yad Vashem, eventually I got the microfilm, it came. But then, while I\u2019m waiting for that, I thought I would to go the archives, and I asked Sharon there innocently, do you have anything from Monasteer? Yes, we have 1400 photographs. Well, here is two huge books, but you couldn\u2019t -- th-they were just only photographs with numbers, no identification. But together there was two rolls of 35 millimeter microfilm, so you take the books to the library, put the -- thread the thing in the reader, and every frame has the same number as the photograph, and written in handwritten Cyrillic was the identity and address of these persons. Well, very quickly, the first day, I advance the microfilm to my relatives. Now though, since it\u2019s Cyrillic the first letter is k, then comes n, and at the end is f. There\u2019s Colonomos from my mother\u2019s brother, I found my aunt. My uncle Salamone Hamma, my father\u2019s brother, and my father\u2019s sister, Oro, who had married a man named Franco. Well, I took copies of it, I -- I came home. I was a bit moved by this discovery. Okay, marvelous things over the weekend, and then the following Monday I called the archives, and it was Sharon, she says, \u201cWell, Mr. Nehama, you know, we wanted to call you, but I was hesitating, and,\u201d -- I said, \u201cLook, let me tell you why I\u2019m calling. Since I was able to read about my [indecipherable] perhaps This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection maybe I can help.\u201d She said, \u201cThat\u2019s what we were going to ask you too, if you would be willing to.\u201d And that\u2019s what got me started, and -- and that -- that initial piece of work took almost a year, because now, for the first six months, I would go the museum carrying my portable computer, and get the books, get the microfilm, sit in front of a reader, and as I read -- and some of these things are sometimes unreadable, I would then transfer them to the computer. Then one day it dawned on me that instead of trudging and getting all these things to the museum, maybe I would rent a microfilm reader, and bring it here to my house, and I don\u2019t have to -- to travel. But immediately then I thought, there is a button on the microfilm reader, and if you press it, 1t gives you a copy out of the printer. Well, that means that the stupid thing goes out digitally so that the printer can print it. If it goes out to the printer, it can sure go to a CD.

Then after that was finished, the -- the archives, the photo archives, I did the same thing with the Yad Vashem register, which is even more difficult, because, you know, even if you magnify, it begins to get distorted, but I can show you later, you can even see that different clerks were writing, because you can see that the handwriting is changing over time.

A few years ago, the -- after my first grandson was -- was born, Ian, then I said, all right, there will come a time where, like everyone will -- will ask, wh-what is relativity about? So -- so I put together a little handmade illustration like a film, that explains, I thought -- explains relativity -- special relativity, not general relativity to a child. The truth is that it requires a little bit more sophistication, although children grasp things much more quickly, because they don\u2019t carry terrible baggage that they have to discard first. But there are certain aspects of special relativity that one has to be able to at least make a leap of [indecipherable] because one thing to which special relativity is key, namely the velocity of light, we cannot experience it. You can only think about it, and the -- in fact there have been books that tell you, supposing the velocity of light was not what it is. Suppose it was on -- an every day kind of speed, like you drive you car -- say speed of light was 30 miles per hour. What would happen? You -- you go out in the street, and -- and you see a person in a bicycle, and as he moves, you would see him squashed, because it\u2019s one of the lengths in -- in -- in a -- in a direction of travel shrink because that\u2019s one of the aspects of -- of special relativity. But because you can\u2019t make -- you know, but -- so you have to be able to imagine this thing, and then -- but I made this film, so I\u2019m waiting for a time when my grandsons would begin to ask questions about the relativity, or about mathematics, and either I will make films for them, or -- or tell This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Because I remember from childhood I would be fascinated I had certain heroes. Ulysses was one of them, or Odysseus. Or -- or Hercules, or Eracles. Then later on, in the be -- when I started -- another hero was Alexander the Great. Now in subsequent reading now, I have concluded he was a thug in many respects.

I have been m-more impressed by the works of all of the writers of the Holocaust, there\u2019ve been quite a few. But the one that -- that I admire most is Primo Levi. Number one may be because he was both a -- a scientist and a chemist, as well as a extremely sensitive individual, let alone a -- a wonderful writer. And you know, although most people now conclude that he committed suicide, rather than dying because of an accident falling down -- downstairs, I have not ever found it ne -- essential, or at least that I could even remotely hypothesize that this particular personal problem is tied -- and as far as looking for help, maybe it could be resolved, but it would not be cause of that, not because of the Holocaust."

But there were also some byproducts, if I can call them, which really would last a lot longer, because in the process I came into contact with individuals of similar interests. There\u2019s a matter of me corresponding with -- his name 1s Moses Hasson, he lives in Santiago, Chile, because the people from Monasteer were early settlers in 1916 in a small town called Temooko, in the lake district in Chile. And -- and was one of the oldest Sephardic as well as monastilee communities in South America. Then I -- I met -- and I have not met yet in person, a man who wrote a book about Monasteer, his name is Mark Cohen, he lives in San Francisco area. And it was through Mark\u2019s researchers that I found, and I fe -- I have copies now of reasons the s -- s -- the declaration of 16 prominent Mo-Monasteer Jews, among them my great-grandfather Solomon, to establish the alliance fran\u00a2aise in- in Monasteer. Then in 1924, my grandfather, Isaac, whose name I bear, was the president of the Monasteer communit -- the Jewish community of Monasteer, and we have a facsimile of his letter from Yale, in Yale, where\u2019s he\u2019s addressing the illion israllitany versell in Paris, thanking them for the donations of clothing and money to the Jews of Monasteer who had been severely -- suffered through fierce bombardment during the first World War, to almost the total destruction of Jewish homes.

All of that, in addition to being gratifying that -- that I -- I -- I have some lineage of people who gave something to the community, which reminded me of a thing my father would tell me when I was growing up, that human beings, in their infancy, for self preservation are very selfish. They don\u2019t think about anybody else. Then they go to school, they meet other people, so they begin to share. When they have a family, they begin to give to others. But some people stop there. Now, very few people begin to give to a larger circle, namely their immediate community. Still fewer give to even larger circle, the country to which they belong. And finally, extremely few, maybe one in million, give to the entire world. So the idea of -- of giving back harks back -- and I don\u2019t know whether my father was saying it because of the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the history that he knew of the environment of his own ancestors in community affairs. So \u2019m glad that -- that -- that to some extent -- and I also believe that there is a kind of a ledger that somebody keeps, and so I -- I like to make the books balance. So that\u2019s the kind of -- of reward that the work is -- that I\u2019ve done represents, and then finally that I may be able, both through the video recording, as well as the audio recording, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- sort of relieves me from something else that my children have been asking me insistently to do, to write my memoirs. So at least I -- 1f -- 1f I only write certain other parts, and I don\u2019t write others, as least there will still be part of the record that they can refer to, 1f they choose to, after I\u2019m gone.
