This is an interview with Isaac Nehama, conducted by Margaret West on June the second, 2003, in Bethesda, Maryland. This interview is part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\u2019s post-Holocaust interview project, and is a follow-up interview to a USHMM videotaped interview conducted with Isaac Nehama on October the 22\", 2002. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A.",
            "answer": "My name is Isaac Nehama. I was born in Athens, Greece, April 29, ninetweent-- 1926. I returned to Athens from the partisans. I was stationed at that time in Thessaly, in the city of Lireza, which 1s the capital of Thessaly. I returned to Athens t -- either towards the very end of October, \u201944, or beginning of November \u201944. Approximately two or three weeks after the liberation of Greece -- actually, the Germans left Greece because the Russians were about to enter Yugoslavia, and therefore their retreat would have been cut off. So the Germans essentially left Greece."

            "question": "And when were you reunited with -- with your father?",
            "answer": "Well, I arrived in Athens on, I remember, a Sunday. And the reason this 1s prominent, because I think Sundays everywhere in the world are very quiet days, sometimes they are deserted. I arrived in Athens f -- with a bus that I had taken from Lireza perhaps around four or five o\u2019clock in the afternoon. I called from the bus station, and I was told to immediately come. I took a taxi, and when finally we were approaching our neighborhood, and my house, I expected to be greeted in the street by my two younger brothers, but I saw no one. In fact, there was not a single person in the street. And I walked up to our apartment, I rang the door. A woman came out, who I recognized to be the woman whom I had seen in t -- in Lireza two weeks or so previously, who had told me that she had been passing through, and she had a message from my family, they were, all of them anxious, waiting to -- to be reunited with me, and she was the one who even gave me money for the -- for the fare back. Of course, I- I now know, and -- or soon learned that my father had given her the money to -- to give me for the fare. In any case -- so she -- she s -- immediately, without even -- I think she didn\u2019t even say a -- any words, but simply with a finger pointed upstairs to the apartment of our pre-war neighbors, a family called Shabitai. I didn\u2019t know what to make of it, why would I have to go to the Shabitai\u2019s to see my family? So I went one more flight, and I knocked on the door, and Mrs. Shabitai opened the door, and she embraced me, and I was shown into their living room, and then I saw my father, and only my father, with Mr. Shabitai. I -- I -- we embraced, and I immediately asked where 1s mother, and -- and -- and Sam, and -- and Mekko, as we used to call the youngest brother. And my father was crying, and I think un-unable to explain, and Mr. mi -- Shabitai said that th-they were not there, they were -- they were caught, but that that wasn\u2019t the time to explain. They implied that I must have known that terrible things happen, and that my mother and brothers were caught, and no one knows -- knew where they went. That was the -- the reunion."

            "question": "Tell me how you proceeded from -- from that im -- immediate reunion, to beginning to plan where you would live, and how you would put your lives together?",
            "answer": "Yeah, but I have to -- to cover 1v -- the brai -- brief period that occurred about two weeks after my arrival. I -- in -- in the beginning of December of \u00b044, there was a brief civil war between the left -- political left, and the government, and also the British forces in Athens. And these troubles primarily occurred in Athens. There -- there was fighting in the street, and all of us were sort of hiding to try to avoid being injured. Then, in about 15 days after the start of the troubles -- I s -- even then we called it the events, our neighborhood was liberated, and as I recall by a small group of English parachutists, I remember their red berets. So that was the beginning of what I thought was going to be normalcy, but very quickly, two days later, I was standing in line to buy some food, which was unavailable, and I was arrested by Greek gendarmes, taken, interrogated. They wanted me to reveal names of known leftists. I explained to them I had been gone for slightly over a year, I knew nobody, I was not politically active. But it -- nevertheless, I was -- I was taken in a c -- little camp out -- out -- outside of Athens, and eventually to Africa. But very shortly, through the intervention of relatives, I was freed, and came back. So I think it was, essentially in the beginning of 45 that we even began to even think about the restoration of our lives. Since as soon as I finish high school in 1942, the universities were closed, and I couldn\u2019t go on, and my father had resumed his occupa -- work with -- he was chief accountant of a large textile firm in Athens. So he resumed hi-his -- his profession. Also, I must note that the apar -- our apartment in Athens, where we lived before, a -- a couple, a husband and a wife, one of them being the woman who gave me the money in -- in Lireza. They were occupying half of the apartment, they couldn\u2019t be evicted, or -- or -- 1t was out of the question to -- to -- to -- to -- to take any action. So my father and I sort of lived in half of the apartment, until about six or eight months later, after Sam returned, Mr. and Mrs. Stasinopolous, that was their name, eventually left, and went, and found another - another apartment. So immediately I -- I then began getting preparations for taking the entrance exam to the Polytechnic Institute in Athens, which I -- this usually took place in the end of August, beginning of September. And indeed, in -- in September of \"45, I took the exams, and I was admitted, and I -- I had one semester in the Polytechnic Institute, before I had found out -- which we perhaps will go into in -- ina moment, that my father had begun to, without telling me a word, working assiduously to find a way for me to study all -- abroad, which he eventually was successful, and -- but that\u2019s ano -- a different chapter."

            "question": "Yes. When you were a teenager, you had been working. What was the work that you were doing then, and you were doing it until 1943?",
            "answer": "Well, I -- I -- I -- as I said, I finished high school in June of \u201942. Since the universities were closed, then it was unthinkable, I think, for my father and mother that I would simply remain idle. So I was -- my father found a job for me. Let me describe it as being the clandestine, or an illegal market in currency. There was a -- not a black market, but a clandestine market of currency in -- in -- in Greece during the occupation. What was exchanged were principally, and almost exclusively, gold coins, either British sovereigns, French gold francs, or Swiss francs. Occasionally -- and the only non-metal currency that was acceptable were U.S. dollars. And also, occasionally, small bars of gold. So, this individual, who was originally from Salonika, and who was a -- in the stock market in Salonika, the legal stock market, he had, with his family, escaped from Salonika, established himself in Athens, and then started a -- an office by himself. A bureau conducting this sort of activity. Very briefly, the way it worked, if somebody wanted to, let\u2019s say sell or buy gold coins, against drachmas -- because drachma of course was, in the occupation, highly devalued. The -- the value of -- th -- the price fluctuated according to the political fortunes of the allies. For instance, while Rommel was advancing in North Africa, then the pound, and the dollar -- or the gold pound and the dollar, would then be def -- deflated. And when, on the contrary, when the allies began to -- to -- to -- to -- t -- to win, and turn the tide around, then the -- the- the drachma would be more highly valued, because it would have s-some value other than what the piece of paper that was the currency during the occupation. So this is what, essentially, he was doing. And my job was -- I didn\u2019t do the trades, but I had to deliver to a buyer, or -- a f -- f -- first of all, even to deliver a roll of let\u2019s say, 10 gold sovereigns to the buyer, I had to go first to the seller, to his house, get the roll of coins, put them in my pocket, and deliver them to the -- to the buyer. It was, let\u2019s say, a dangerous activity because possession, let alone trade in gold, was illegal. If I had been caught, I -- I would have been jailed, shot, or whatever it was. Even conducting this sort of business was -- was illegal. So there was a f -- the front was that -- there we- we had a number of shelves in the office with textiles. Woolens, and some silks, pretending that it was that sort of business, but actually, the -- the business itself was the -- the currency."

Both of them are what is referred to as Romaniots, which can be explained either as Greek speaking, or negatively, non-Ladino, not Judeo espanole speaking, or they were not descendants of the Jews who were expelled from Spain in 1492. In contrast, my parents on both sides -- both of them were born in Monasteer, traced their ancestry to the Sephardim who left Spain, and eventually ended up in that part of the Balkans, which was, at that time, a part of the Ottoman Empire."

No, no, I -- I -- I don\u2019t recall -- really I think that I couldn\u2019t distinguish any surface difference between the looks of my family or our relatives, and other Greeks. They all have, perhaps the same kind of Mediterranean look, which not even -- has even particularly darker skin coloration. Of course, a -- a -- you -- you -- you would find very rarely, even among Greeks, or -- or Turks, or southern Italians, or Spanish, blonde people. But there were a few there, but otherwise there were no such characteristics of Sephardim. The thing that was distinguishing, of course was that my parents spoke Ladino to each other, and my maternal grandmother, who would come and visit us, at least two or three times a week, she lived with an aunt- a sister of my mother\u2019s, that\u2019s the only language that she understood, and we had to speak to her, and she spoke to us with s -- Ladino."

I mean, he had lost his -- at this particular point, he had lost his wife and two sons. Do you have a sense of what gave him strength, and what his state of mind was?",
            "answer": "I can only surmise -- I -- I have to -- because this -- it occurs, and I think about it very often. Or in discussions I have with people. And I always have to remind myself and my interlocutors that at least in those times, and -- and in -- in that particular part of the world, parents were not really very communicative about personal and intimate things, with y-young children. I -- I -- I think -- I -- I -- Ica -- I recollect from cousins that they began to have conversation as between adults, and equals with their parents, after they themselves had matured, and were married. So I don\u2019t think that there was, let\u2019s say, reluctance. My father used to be a great storyteller, but I must say that very seldom, o-o-other than in passing he would say how dinner was in -- on -- on high holidays in Monasteer, how the dinner would be prepared, and things like this. A episode of things like this. But not very much about personal life. But coming back to your question, there was very little exchange between us as to either how we felt -- I told him about some of the things that I had thought about during my sojourn in the Greek mountains with the partisans, but really very briefly, and I think mostly superficial. We didn\u2019t go into -- into that. Knowing my father as I recollect him, he was an individual of -- you know, he was lame, as you know, because of polio, and he had a club foot. So he was always hobbled. He always wor -- wor -- walked with a cane. But he -- he had a -- an inner strength that became evident to me very rarely. I think you -- you know the example of his urging me not to be caught alive by the Germans. So, I can only imagine the -- the pain that he had with the loss -- or at that time, you know, we still had a very, very faint hope that perhaps they might return. We- remember the war was not over in Europe until April -- end of April \u201945, so the pictures of -- and -- and -- and stories, and -- and things about like the horrors of the camps was still totally unknown. So there was a -- a -- a residue of hope, although very, very slight, that they mi -- they might come back. And the focus, therefore, was I think a -- a tacit -- a mutual understanding that we had to get on with our lives as best we could, and so my father resumed his work, and I then resumed the preparations for taking the exams."

            "question": "Mm-hm. You know, wh-when I asked you that question, I was thinking of his admonishing you to not be taken by the Germans. And I think he spoke of that, I\u2019m assuming, because you had shown your determination not to go into hiding, but to go to the mountains. And you were the oldest, and you\u2019d had your Bar Mitzvah. And times were times of duress, I -- which prompted me to think perhaps he was more open in what he said to you.",
            "answer": "Well, but you have to remember that -- th -- it was such a special moment, I -- I cannot conceive of an -- a recollection -- let me back off, very quickly. In the summer of \u00b039, my father took me to a -- there\u2019s a -- a place about a hundred kilometers from Athens, it\u2019s called Lutrikey, and it\u2019s a -- sort of a spa, because it has water sources that are -- contain rad-radio activity, radium. And they were thought to be very beneficial for whatever a-ails you. It was essentially a resort. And so we went ahead of the rest of the family for three or four days. It was shortly after by -- my Bar Mitzvah, and I still remember the first time that -- so we were the two of us, and is the first instance that I recall my father telling me, for example [indecipherable] personal plans, that he had begun to -- I see -- remember telling me -- put some money aside, and part of plan was we were going to leave the apartment where we had lived for -- since I rec -- I recall. And we\u2019re going to buy a house. So it was the first time that I had heard my father telling me of something about his -- let\u2019s say dreams and plans for the future. So, in other words, it was the first instance where I think I was tr -- being treated as an adult. The unfortunate thing is that as soon as we returned, the war started, in September of \u00b039, so we too -- September thir -- or -- or -- or that summer of \u201939, it\u2019s the last summer -- and that in 1940 because the war didn\u2019t touch Greece until the fall of 1940 that are the last two summers that I can recall of being if not happy, at least -- I have to use a French word, insouciance, that we were not bothered. The war had started, it was a terrible thing. My parents had both gone through the experience of the first World War, and it\u2019s horrors in Monasteer, but it was so far away that it didn\u2019t yet begin to touch us until the fall of 1940. So, it\u2019s a long detour to what\u2019s -- what -- what you ask. So | -- I -- I think there was a tremendous amount of resilience, and strength that -- in my father, which was not apparent on the surface. When he admonished me not to be caught alive by the Germans, I think 1t was because he knew from all the reports of the 30\u2019s, since the rise of Hitler in Germany, the history of the -- of the Jews in Gaspora, all these things, you know, get farely concentrated, and simply -- al-although I don\u2019t think he -- no one knew at that time of concentration camps, but he knew that 1t was not a good thing to be caught alive by the Germans. So he -- he -- it was a second instance of I -- his addressing me as an adult, and telling me that it\u2019s better to -- to be dead, than be caught alive."

            "answer": "F -- yo-your absolutely correct about the pall, because it was so palpable, I -- I can still feel it. I don\u2019t re -- recall that there was, let\u2019s say, a smile on their faces after about mid or early April of 1943, because the news began to come in very quickly about both Monasteer and Salonika. Those occur about two or three weeks apart. And the -- although -- sou -- a few things were written up in the papers that was really not -- some that was really spoken, but they knew from reports of relatives.

Surely -- I\u2019m sure that they wouldn\u2019t want to alarm us, especially my younger brothers. But even to me, they -- they didn\u2019t say things because they knew that I would have -- I wouldn\u2019t have that much to contribute. But it was -- it was a sort of shielding, but I think it was primarily because they themselves were, first of all, not only so crushed by what they had heard, but the principle thing was that they be -- I\u2019m sure now, in retrospect, that they were mulling what to do in case so -- something like this would reach Athens. So I think their total preoccupation for all that time after beginning of April \u201943 was precisely what to do. That\u2019s why when finally it did occur, September of \u201943, after the Italian armistice, then suddenly, and for the first time, we had a family council, something that had never occurred before. And my father and mother sat us around the table, and with very few words, told us what we had to do. Therefore, all these preparations must have been part of what they -- they were preoccupied in what they were preparing to do. Because 1--]--[ -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B"

            "answer": "All right. A couple of weeks before the dispersal, a friend of -- a sc-schoolmate -- I- | would speak about my role first. Although again, I hadn\u2019t discussed this with my parents, but sensing what was happening, this school f-friend, Thanasis Mikalopoulus, who is a Christian Greek, I had told him that there may come a time when I may have to go into hiding, and then -- we were close friends, but I hadn\u2019t even met his parents. He says, \u201cThey\u2019ll be n-no question, you will come and stay with us.\u201d So that sort of was done. When then we had this family council about where to go, I will tell you very quickly, my -- my father -- first of all, no Jewish family, really more than three or four at most, could possibly be hiding all together, because it would have been very apparent, no matter where they were hiding, that neighbors would immediately see, suddenly, not one or two, which you can justify as being my visiting relative from the provinces. Well, not suddenly, you know, a whole -- a whole family. So, this person was essential. My father went and -- and stayed for a certain period of time. Certainly until my departure from the mountains about a month later, with a -- a couple, they were childless. Both the man and the -- the -- the woman -- his name was Tenasias, her name was Ellie, they were both working in the same company that my father did, so they were both colleagues, as well as friends of long-standing. Next door to our house in Athens, to our apartment, was a man who had a small store that was really a mini variety store. By that I mean he -- he sold tobacco, cigarettes, newspapers, but also in the back o-of -- he had thread, and needles. It was that -- that sort of convenience neighborhood store. And over the years my father had become very, very friendly with this individual, and he had a house in one of the suburbs on the eastern side of Athens, really a -- a vi -- a far suburb.

But I think it\u2019s worth you discussing that more, just because something happened in Germany where -- perhaps it was baser instincts of humans were worked on, but they began to see the Jews as not human. And that enabled them to collaborate with the Nazis.",
            "answer": "Well yes, but remember, it took quite a bit of time, and quite a bit of history for things of that sort to take place. Look at Bulgaria. In 1941 they pass a law, which has about -- magnificent Orwellian title, the law for the protection of the state. But it was almost patterned -- similar to the Nuremberg laws, and -- and most of it\u2019s provisions were clearly anti-Semitic. Or what happened to the Romanian Jews? Half a million people were -- most of them massacred by the Iron guard of Romanians themselves. Or the -- the Jews of Serbia and Croatia? Most of them died of starvation by the Ustasha, th-th-th-th -- the -- the Croatian Fascists. So, the Germans, by no means had - didn\u2019t have, you know, the exclusive patent to brutality and cruelty. They rose it to -- to heights of subtlety and -- and demonic deviousness. [indecipherable] Salonika Jews, they were telling them that they gonna send them to Krakow, and -- and un- unfortunately, the -- the chief rabbi, who was the leader of the community in Salonika was a -- a gullible, naive, stupid individual, who then tried to reassure the -- th-the Jews of Salonika that their brethren in Krakow were going to take care of them. Of course, the Germans didn\u2019t tell them that Krakow had already been totally eliminated. So this kind of a thing hadn\u2019t reached Greece or Italy. Maybe -- I don\u2019t know, maybe the ethnic character, 1t would never have taken root, but I have to admit that I often think that we have failed miserably, in the last 50 or 60 years. When I was in the mountains we thought that that was going to be the end of this sort of brutality, and one sees it repeated over, and over again, as if these things didn\u2019t happen. So I feel a personal sense of failure, that my generation has done something terribly wrong."

Well, 1-1 -- first of all, I cou -- I didn\u2019t recognize him right away, because he had grown so much in the brief year and a half that -- almost two years since I had see -- we had seen each other.

I think of how fearful a time it must have been when the rest of your family, your mother, grandmother, and brothers were taken for questioning.

            "answer": "The answer 1s, we didn\u2019t talk, but -- and I again, I surmise that -- l-let\u2019s put some dates, so we -- we -- we will know what we are talking about. My mother and brothers were caught towards the end of June, beginning of July of 1944. They were incarcerated in the detention camp of Hithari. And on July 29, they were put on board the last transport that ever left Greece, together with the 1800 Rhodesian Jews. I can imagine that my father learned about that not because anyone went and told him. There was no such contact, but he must have surmised, because they say from a negative side, lack of contact from time to time, my mother, or Sam would go to my father, not so much alone to see him, but also to get money. Also, perhaps -- we didn\u2019t cover that, I don\u2019t believe in the video interview, but I know subsequently, that my father changed hiding places three times, because -- you know, the -- you can only maintain a -- a pretense of a visiting relative up to a certain point, all right? So there would come a time when it was time to go. Some -- ok -- times there were o -- really ostensible reasons that people would suspect, or even somebody would whisper and say -- they begin to s -- to know that you are Jews, whereupon both the family who were doing the sheltering, as well as the sheltered, knew that it was time to -- to move. So my father moved three times. At the time of, I think, the capture of my mother, grandmother and brothers, he -- it was finally in the last place, the third place, before the liberation.

            "answer": "Yes. Yes, this is a -- a -- really a very painful a-aspect to me, because of what Sam told me. In their interrogation, the beatings that my mother and he were subjected -- not the young one, not the me -- Mekko. And they kept on asking them about my father\u2019s and my whereabouts. Of course, in -- 1n a case for me, she did not know. And then Sam told me that for months, and months, and months, my mother was really destitute, and -- and -- a -- I mean, extremely concerned about what had happened to me. She did not know where I had gone. I\u2019m sure my father told her, \u201cHe\u2019s gone to the mountains.\u201d But even with my father I didn\u2019t com -- there was no way to communicate and -- and send notes from time to time, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m fine.

Of cursing them, of calling them criminals, of telling them that their comeuppance would come very soon. This -- I mean, either heroism -- you know, that\u2019s un-unthinkable, or foolhardiness, another thing my mother was a foolhardy person.

One that at their arrival in Auschwitz, 1n the morning of August 16, of 1944, parathetically -- can I say how I -- we know that? Yes, because I looked at the da -- the so-called danuta Auschwitz chronicles as they are known, which is entries, almost like a diary every day of oc-occurrences. And the entry for August 16, it talks about the almost 2000 Rhodesian Jews. It doesn\u2019t tell the complete story, there were another har -- 600 non-Rhodesian Jews among them, my mother and -- and -- and brothers. They arrived there, and in the -- this of course, famous separation, the re -- the single reason that he was moved to -- towards the labor camp, was because of his height. He was only -- \u201944 -- he was 14 years old, but he was a lot taller than his age, and he also credits the fact that the month detention in Hidari outside of Athens before the transport, where he was forced to do stupid, meaningless labor of moving rocks from one place to the other, had -- and the food was good, also, there, amazing because it was the Red Cross who were feeding them, that he -- he gained enough muscle so that in the separation, he was then pointed to be taken to labor -- all right -- to the labor camp. Once then in the labor camp, after the famous three or four weeks of so-called quarantine, then he was taken to a section of Auschwitz called the boodi, which was a set of farms that were being worked on by a combination of Polish and German farmers, and the inmates were doing the -- the hard labor. But the survival in boodi, in particular then the survival in the famous Death March in the winter of \u201945, when Auschwitz got shut down because of the Russians coming in, and they were taken elsewhere. Sam credits it to the care of older men, who took him, as they did also other, younger kids, under their wings. In particular in protecting them about -- especially what not to do. And what to be a-a-aware of, because as we know, human beings in those circumstances did terrible things to each other, stealing bread, just sort of pure survival.

I don\u2019t mean the resistance, they just went up there, and were able to hide and lose themselves in -- in the population in the parts of Greece that they were known as free Greece, which included the region where I was. About 1300 were the -- in the resistance, in any case. But very shortly -- I mean, mid \u201945, immediately we had visitors from Israel, and I still remember young Israelis, but Greek speaking Israelis, but totally different, and -- and darkened from sun, and -- and full of muscle, and -- peasants. I mean, things out there that you don\u2019t necessarily associate with the appearance of -- of -- of Jews, especially those that live in cities who are -- live soft lives. In any case, they had been sent on purpose to recruit young men to come to Israel. And as you know, they did. Quite a few were then sent to what\u2019s called Akshara, which was sort of a preparatory school for three or four weeks, to teach the rudiments of living in a kibbutz. And then it was -- all of 1t was clandestine, because one night, in -- at night -- and they were taken by boat to ships that were not in territorial Greek waters, and there they were taken, and then taken to Greece again in secret, because they didn\u2019t come as part of the British quotas, they were trying to violate. And some of them were caught and incarcerated in Cypress, in any case. So I - I was, and some of my friends, lobbied intensely by the Israelis to come to Palestine, but the reason I\u2019m laughing 1s -- y-you -- it\u2019s -- I recollect, and -- and I -- I think it\u2019s so unreal. Most of our preoccupation in questi -- questioning the Israelis about what kind of government are we going to have, if eventually a state is formed. Because our experience, you know, in the mountains, and things like this is we need to be democratic, and you know, almost Socialistic, and things like -- th-the Israelis would look at us as though w-we were nuts, and say, \u201cLook, w-we have many things to do before w-we come to that point. The first thing to do is to try to -- to make sure that we become a state. When we become a state, then people will ha -- will -- will vote,\u201d and - and we were surely looking for reassurances ahead of time. Well, and that was -- there was a very strong thing. The reason I didn\u2019t become extremely serious, you know, to the point of taking action, what they say -- first of all, A, I couldn\u2019t leave my father. Sam had not even yet appeared on the scene when these events of the contact with the Israelis occurred. Sam had not e -- yet returned, number one, and two, of course, the Israelis had departed, and then of course the British clamped down, and it wasn\u2019t even possible to do that any more. And then of course, my departure from the United States, you know, made this thing a moot point. But yes, there was a very strong period of I would say two or three months, where practically I got on the boat to go to Palestine."

A -- a number of friends and so forth, who thought they were be of imminent draftable age, did a number of things, including going to graduate school which they never thought or intended to go, in order to get deferments. Other even went to the length of quickly getting married, so they would be supporters of family. And then I -- I was told that I would be given a -- an assistanceship, a research assistanceship to continue to graduate school, which then enabled me to go through the Master\u2019s degree. Then I decided to continue on for the doctorate. And I went for the additional year, including then taking the oral exams. And the oral exams were -- were- took place on June third, 1953, the date of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth. So I passed the oral. So what was left to d -- to -- to do was to write the thesis, and in fact my advisor and I had selected the topic, but I had run out of money. And there was no- the assist-assistanceship funding was over. So it was a question of how I mi -- a -- going to be able to support myself. My professor had arranged for me -- my advisor to work for the summer at Bell Telephone Laboratories, just for the summer. And then, after taking the orals, I was offered a permanent position at Bell Laboratories. Well, I talked to my professor, and he said, \u201cAll right, it\u2019s a little -- rarely done, but it can be done. You can arrange for to write the thesis in absentia.\u201d Which was the plan. Unfortunately I was drafted a year later, and -- although after my release from the army, I intended to continue on -- to try to -- to write the thesis by -- in the meantime, at the University of Illinois, they stopped allowing thesis to be written in absentia, because of pressure from the legislature.

While I -- I was studying for the orals, in April of 40 thre -- 40- of \u00b053, my landlady tells me that somebody\u2019s -- wants to talk to me, a gentleman appears, hands me a letter, I open it up, it\u2019s from the immigration naturalization service, I\u2019m to depart United States within two weeks.

The long and the short is they intervened. I mean, they got me to talk to a congressman, who then talked to the immigration department, immigration department renewed my stay for another year. So I thought that was going to be the end of that, right? Without my knowing -- I had told one of my professors what had happened , and while I was in Chicago, and even after my return two or three days later, without my knowing, four professors wrote to the then Senator Dograss of Illinois, who introduced a private bill in congress, and eventually became a law, known as the law for the relief of Isaac Ne-Nehama. It was signed by President Eisenhower, and by law I became a -- I was accepted as an immigrant, outside of the student visa restrictions, because student visa is a restricted class, where you are not allowed to -- to stay permanently. So I was now, because of the special bill, I was now a special -- a -- a -- an immigrant. So I would have to wait for my five years, you know, to be -- to gain citizenship. But being inducted into the army, automatically within six months, then you become a citizen, for the very obvious reason that a country cannot ask you to defend it, and at the same time not recognizing you as a citizen."

And since in the army it\u2019s very important- Or even more important what you don\u2019t do, than what you do, instead of cleaning pots or -- or -- or being in the trenches, I was teaching in the signal school, reserve officers who were passing every three months, to take refresher courses in radio, telephony, and things like that.

And so we were going out together, and in fact when I got my notice from the draft board to present myself for training, Ann -- I can only tell you subs -- from subsequent information -- her own parents were divorced, it was a -- arather unhappy marriage, and she convinced me. I maybe n-not have taken a lot of convincing, I was a little bit hesitant because, you know, going into the army, goodness knows where I could be shipped. But she was persuasive enough to tell me that she would accompany me wherever we went, if it [indecipherable] allowed. The long and the short is we -- we got married. And she went to school in Colorado Springs, at the university because she eventually intended to go to medical school. When we return, lived in New Jersey, she enrolled at NYU. And she was -- began to have problems. First of all, academic problems, and then one day she disappeared. The long and the short is I found out through a physician who was -- knew her from -- since childhood, that according to him, she was a schizophrenic. And he -- who -- and this -- this man urged me to simply get away as fast as I could. I was -- my reaction was, you know, \u201cYou\u2019re just telling me that I\u2019m dealing with a sick person, and you\u2019re telling me to abandon a sick person?\u201d But he convinced me that it\u2019s the kind of a thing that has no hope for -- for cure, and -- and it would have been almost an impossibility. The long and the short is that I got a quick divorce in Mexico. It was consensual, it wasn\u2019t contested or anything like that. That\u2019s what happened."

            "answer": "All right, all right. Well, you know, there was always a kind of phrase to describe the Bell system. We used to refer to 1 -- 1 -- to it as -- collectively as Mother Bell. So one can conjure up a -- an older woman, rather buxom, you know. Warm, that you feel warm in -- in -- in -- in -- near her. Well, in other words, 1t was a magnificent preparation for a career, because first of all you -- you were among individuals of extreme capability. Bell Laboratories recruited only the upper one percent of graduates in American universities. So there were no idiots there, and -- and you couldn\u2019t really make it through with hot air, you would be found out right away. So it was a -- a very, very demanding -- well, not demanding, but -- but really very mar-marvelous preparation. By the same token, it was a -- an extremely inbred thing. We -- we thought collectively that we knew everything. And -- so in -- there was a little bit of a struggle because there was no formal thing. My dreams always were that when I started my career, I would be taken under the wing of an experienced person who would take me slowly through the -- and it didn\u2019t happen. It isn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t learn things from colleagues, I did, a great deal. But there was no former -- you were essentially left on your own. And there came times I think almost three or four weeks after I started, that I really had terrible time believing that I was earning my paycheck under false pretenses. That -- that I wasn\u2019t doing anything valuable. But I very quickly got over that, because I began to do serious things. And then I got drafted, and I return, a-and -- and then it happened that we were working on the first field trial of this first ever new telephone exchange, what has taken Bell Laboratories biggest department of 400 people, six or seven years to prepare for the field trial in Modess, Illinois. And I started the -- the -- the system, and I came to the conclusion that it will not work. Not - not that it will not work, that it -- it would not accommodate the kind of capacity that it was aimed to, something like 20,000 or 40,000 subscribers. My analysis showed that it would barely make it for 2000 subscribers. Well, it was solid enough thing that my own supervisor believed it, and f -- you know, typically then I was -- I gave it a -- a presentation. And of course the first reaction was one of horrible shock and -- and -- and -- and -- and disdain, but the stuff was solid enough, and that was -- I became a -- immediately a rising star. I was almost, I think, thrown out into the street, and within a week I became a fair haired boy, and I got promoted, became a first promotion supervisor. But then I got the notion, a year after I became promoted that I really wanted to be in a higher stratum of research, and I left and went to the Rand Corporation in California, where I was going to work, believe it or not, it was a joke, really to [indecipherable] subsequently on artificial intelligence, because two people who had written some papers, told me that they had funding from the Air Force to start an effort, and I wanted to be a participant there. When I got there, simply the -- the plans were totally different, never as I said, and that experience at Rand was, in itself of a different kind, but equally rewarding. Your --"

The enthusiasm there, of going and doing something like this was so [indecipherable] and -- and -- and -- and it- it encompassed practically hundreds of thousands of engineers, and -- and people around the country. The enthusiasm was -- was great. It has not been replicated. But if I may tell you that things like this have occurred, and I can assure you that I have not really been an instrument in choosing the situations, but throughout my career, Bell Laboratories, the new telephone system, then the Apollo program, the Rand Corporation artificial intelligence. In other words, what I\u2019m trying to emphasize is that these things occur both in companies as well as 1n -- even in countries, very rarely, where you undertake something where there is no precedent. Because when you are in situations like this, then ideas flow freely. When you are in a -- 1n a environment with a lot of tradition, and you say, \u201cWell, what about this thing?\u201d Then they\u2019ll say, \u201cLook, we ve tried that.\u201d Or, \u201cWe don\u2019t do things like this around here.\u201d When you are in a new situation, then all ideas are given free reign. Now, all of them are not equally good, and some could be good, or even better than what was -- which -- which was in, but even countries don\u2019t have the luxury of pursuing two or three avenues in parallel. So to be in a -- in -- in a -- in a -- in an environment like this, it\u2019s the -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s almost like getting drunk, or smoking -- which I don\u2019t know what smoking pot or any of these things would be, but it\u2019s -- I remember the early 50\u2019s in the Bell Laboratories. Unless you are either under narcosis or an utter idiot, you couldn\u2019t help but stumble on new inventions, on new ideas. It was a kind of a ferment that occurs very, very infrequently in the lives of companies, or the survivors in -- in even the [indecipherable]. Somehow it occurred two or three times 1n my career.

And the long and the short was that we made a deal, and essentially, I really didn\u2019t even know what, specifically we were going to do other than to really get into the area of computers, and -- and software, but not concrete ideas. But very quickly after our formation, a couple of fortuitous events occur. The first one was that my former boss at the company that I worked, part of the Bell system that was doing the work on the Apollo program, the company was called Bellcom, and it was, of course, situated in Washington, that\u2019s what brought us from California here. He also had, later on, a year after I left, had moved on to other things, had become chief executive of another company. And he called me on the phone one day, and he said that one of the -- the subsidiaries, who were doing work in -- around the country, they were -- in fact they had almost a virtual monopoly of race track systems. That is to say those systems where they display the odds, and also people go into the windows and bet. But that company, the subsidiary, had started an attempt to computerize their totes, as they were called, it\u2019s also the same name in England, from tote boards. And we -- we -- could we go and -- and see about their plans? So we thought that 1t was going to be a brief engagement of about a couple of months to look over their plans. It turned out to be a six or seven year affair, because when we reviewed their plans, and - and -- and we are -- we told them not only what was done wrong, but how to do it right, they said, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you do it for us?\u201d And the long and the short is, and what made my company was the horses. We -- we build the first computerized systems in the world, and it was really yeah -- to some extent a technological innovation because we used mini-computers, which were just beginning to come into -- into play, primarily as laboratory instruments. No -- no such animal had ever been used in a very, not only real life situation, but betting 1s a very, very technologically demanding situation, because in the half hour period between races, where all the betting\u2019s taking place, the number of transactions is very, very high.

He had come from New York with his wife, and he didn\u2019t want to take the train from Chicago to Champagne, so the president of the university sent his limousine, so I went to get Igor down, and -- and I will tell you a-- a--a little vignette, if you are interested.

He was not that comfortable in English. At some point, about an hour -- it\u2019s about a three hour drive, he was telling me that he had been suffering from stomach problems, and his wife Vera, a magnificent Russian grand dame, was from time to time su -- supporting him, he said, \u201cYeah, yeah, oh she\u2019s been very, very sick at times.\u201d But at some point he said, \u201cLook, I -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m feeling some pains now, would you ask the driver to stop at the next gas station, because I have a thermos bottle with milk in my valise, and I need to,\u201d -- of course, of course. So we stopped, and we opened the trunk, and -- and -- and opened the valise, the driver and I were on the side, and we saw Stravinsky opening the thermos, pouring something, and drinking.

So, when about an hour later he said he had pains again, we understood. This way I met, you know, people like Stravinsky, and Stern, and -- and Metropolus, and Zell. Because I would go pick them up, and then we would always ask them, and in many cases they all did that.

And this it was simply that because of the McCarthy era, perhaps he had connections with leftist groups in the United States, I don\u2019t know. But essentially he had been sort of recalled from vacation by the president of the university, and told that there were such suspicions, or accusations, whatever. The [indecipherable] fact was that he was dismissed from the di -- the directorship of the school of music, but remained as a professor.

So I had nowhere to turn, and I -- I had to -- to cope with the situation. In any case, the following summer, and coincidentally because Sam was getting married, then I decided that I needed a -- a change of scene. In fact at one point I -- I thought that perhaps I would go and -- and -- and live in Europe. And in fact I went to Paris first. And I had been given names of a number of companies, including IBM, and believe me, it took just one interview to completely settle the issue for me, that the only place for me was the United States.

The stresses were strictly personal, the personal stresses of the divorce, of- of -- of all it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a-aftermath, and then finding myself alone, and -- and a little bit lost, and -- and wounded, the way that things had -- had happened. And I -- I imagine it\u2019s either romantic or -- or -- or -- or whatever you want to call it, to s -- to -- to -- to s -- really think that a change of scenery is what you need. So that\u2019s why then I said, \u201cOh, well, all right, let me look into the possibility of working overseas. So I contacted a number of people. When I went to 1 -- to IBM offices, well they said, \u201cYeah, but you see we cannot hire you here, as an American, because that has all kinds of other ramifications. We have to pay you extra salary, allow you return every year for vacation, and so forth and so on. So that\u2019s a totally different kettle of fish, you gotta be hired by IBM there and sent to Paris. But if to hire you here, you have to be hired as a local.\u201d And that meant a totally different situation. The moment I heard that, [ -- | -- I realized 1-it wasn\u2019t going to be for me and I\u2019m glad it -- that 1t occurred very quickly, because then I could enjoy the remaining two months. Because I went to Spain first, went to Greece for Sam\u2019s wedding. This is where I met Paulette, I mean the first time. I mean she was in the receiving line. Then two days later, I got a call from her sister, whom I knew vaguely. I had met her vaguely. Her sister was having a few people for dinner, would I like to come? Sure. So I\u2019m walking, and -- and I\u2019m reaching the -- the -- the block where her sister lived, and at the door is a young lady. Well, we\u2019re both waiting for the door to open, we go, we get into the elevator, and we both realized that we stopped in the same door, and we ring the bell, and of course, it opens up, Yola, her sister, opened the door. They embraced. I thought there was -- she was just another invitee, I had no idea of the relationship. And like an idiot, it was during, really, dinner when a conversation is going between them like Yola is asking Paulette, how are the folks? I mean the parents. Fine. And then I said, naively, \u201cAre you related?\u201d They said, \u201cWe are sisters.\u201d Well, so that was our first meeting. Then the following day, or I di -- two days later, I forget, she called, and now she tells me that this was a daring thing on her part, to tell me that she had tickets to a concert with Isaac Stern, would I like to go? I said, \u201cOf course.\u201d I had dinner with Isaac Stern during my years -- in fact, we went to the concert and after the concert I went backstage, and we had a little reunion with Stern. He remembered me because we had dinner together with his accompanist Zagin. And so we started going together, and within about a week, I proposed to her."

She stayed with friends in Montreal for about two or three months. I would go from time to time to be with her, and also because my divorce was in Mexico, and it was not recognized in Quebec, in the province, because they only recognize religious marriages, and religious annulments or divorces, we were married in Toronto. We knew no one. We went to the registry, and they said, \u201cDo you ha -- do you have any witnesses?\u201d As it happened, there were another couple behind us, also strangers in Toronto, and we became each other wis -- each other\u2019s witnesses, and that\u2019s -- we were married then in -- in -- in June of \u201958."

Really, I think that -- 1t\u2019s one of the questions that I think I saw in your notes, about religion. There 1s a woman named Jane Gerber, you know her work. | -- I -- she invited me to give lectures in -- in Baltimore in July, which I will do. But I just heard a lecture of hers because of the -- of a thing in the National Cathedral where they have some artifacts that came from Spain that -- of the Sephardim Jews there. Wonderful lecture she gave. And a magnificent phrase of hers, I think it was in response to a question, and -- and her phrase was, the relative relaxed attitude of the Sephardim towards religion. And this is as best I can also describe both my religious upbringing, which was not very strict. I mean, we were observant of all the major holiday -- Jewish holidays. Dietary laws are really almost impossible to apply in Athens, because there were 3000 Jews in a city of a million. There -- y-y -- there wasn\u2019t a place to -- to go buy kosher meat and things like this. But in the high holidays, then special arrangements were made for s -- special slaughterers to come, and to provide. So there were no -- there was -- when I -- there were never crustaceans in our house, or things like that. But the observances there, we were -- my job for example, every Friday from the age of five or six, because the synagogue was only about a block away from my house, was to carry the oil donation to the synagogue, because the Sephardim didn\u2019t burn candles. All the -- the lights were olive oil with wicks in there. And go to the synagogue on Sabbath, and of course, all the major holidays.

I remember that in the case of all three girls, when they were ready to now leave home and go to school -- to university, Maya- Sarah going to Boston, Maya in Michigan, and Nicole in Wisconsin, I took them all for a -- a long ride and lunch. And first of all, I told them about the fact that I had been married once before. And a -- a typically -- although they didn\u2019t tell each other, because I asked them not to, they all -- always asked the same question, what was her name? And did by any chance have a sibling that they didn\u2019t know? [indecipherable] not -- no -- no such thing. And then I told them that as they are ready now to go and -- and live their own lives, I told them that a part of the Hippocratic oath a doctors take, one part which I -- I -- I think it\u2019s very important, is above all do no harm."

Not -- yom -- yom -- Yomkesh. So, th-there -- people who are called like that. Now, why was she doing that?

And I still remember she\u2019s in the kitchen, maybe cooking something, and I would then read passages, or from some of -- of these plays. Now some of them, and I still remember, included situations which really -- now, they were not erotic, but for instance I still remember -- although I knew the -- the word -- 1t comes from when it was -- it says -- he says elaparlay arsematress. Well, she did not comment. Normally she would have expected me to ask, \u201cWell, that does matress mean?\u201d You know, because matress has at least two meanings in French. One is a teacher, you know, or mistress, but mistress in the sense of hierarchy, and the other 1s the -- the lover connotation.

One of my earliest memories that I have to tell you, I was I think possibly barely -- four -- four and a half, and I had written from an assignment, you know, half a page. And I showed it to him, and he was incredulous, he says, \u201cYou wrote that?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d I almost saw a -- a -- a look of disbelief, and he says, \u201cHere, here, takes -- take another piece of paper.\u201d He sat down and he dictated a brand new passage from another book for me, and had me write it.

Really I -- I cringe sometimes at being praised. I don\u2019t know why. Which I know 1s a terrible defect, because it\u2019s almost the obverse side of the coin of claming too much.

So, you know, there were -- there -- there were -- there were tensions at times, and she was, you know, quite severe with me.

But on the other hand, especially in the mountains, when I began to reflect about the tensions, and her demands, and things like this. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s then that I began to realize how much what was, I thought, unfair, then was responsible for getting a certain amount of self discipline, and which in the beginning is a chore, then eventually becomes something that you like, namely to go and find out things.

I ha- was about six or seven years old, or maybe eight, and I had become a boy scout, or - or a cub scout, whatever it is. And part of -- of the thing was to get a uniform, but also a staff. You know, the kind of a thing that you have to then use when you climb mountains and so on. Well, when the time came for me to -- to -- to get the staff, you d- you couldn\u2019t go to a store and buy it, but next door, or two doors down from my house was a -- a lumberyard. I -- I went and -- and -- and bought a -- a long, square pole, but now it has to be made into a cylinder. Well, it happened then again that another two doors down was, in the basement, a -- a -- a man who used to make chairs, and he had a wooden lathe what he would turn, as the phrase goes, you know, the -- the -- the legs. And so I t -- I brought the -- that square piece of wood, and he made me wait, and was sit down, and he put it on the lathe. And then he began to explain to me while he\u2019s turning the wood, how this essentially amorphous piece of wood, just a square, long, piece of wood, with his cutter, he would be able to transform it and give it shape. So it -- it was like seeing something be revealed under the hands of a -- of a craftsman in front of my eyes. So then the idea of making things with the hands, is a compliment to the -- the other side of pleasure and discovery, which in -- in -- in mathematics does not require proo -- evidence to the physical world. If you solve a proposition in mathematics, you know when you\u2019ve solved it. You don\u2019t need somebody to come and say yes, that\u2019s right, you know it. Unlike physics, or -- or science where you may have an idea but then it needs to be corroborated by physical observation, experiment. Which 1s then half wasted because it requires both intellect and observation, to then making things, which is entirely by hands, although it requires also some training, which obviously involves the brain. So I -- from those early things then, I wanted to build things. And so when we went to California for the first time, I bought a saw, a table saw, and drills, and began to work with wood because I remember how this craftsman was able to transform -- which is almost the equivalent of the Michelangelo statement that he does not make statues, he just removes the amount of marble, and just reveals what\u2019s already there."

I was able to gain 1800 master points, because we were starting to -- playing in tournaments. At the Rand Corporation, I got involved -- a very favory game, 1s -- it was -- it\u2019s called Krikspiel, which is the German for war game, Krikspiel. This is a -- a- a game with the following. It\u2019s essentially chess, and instead of a single board, there are two boards, with a wall in between the two players. So both boards are set independently, and each player does not see what the other\u2019s board contains. And the moves start. There is an observer, who sees both boards, and whose role 1s only to say whether a move that you may attempt is permissible or not. Permissible in the sense if there\u2019s an opponent piece, you cannot move, let\u2019s say, a square ahead, all right? And his other role is to say whether you have captured a piece. That\u2019s the only thing he\u2019s permitted to say. And the whole notion is that you fight a war when you really don\u2019t know the deployment of the opponent forces. Now, as you proceed with the game, and pieces start getting a -- to be eliminated through capture, and the -- the board thins out, you begin to have a pretty good idea what it 1s. So these are the things which are intellectual games that -- that -- that attracted me. But inc -- we moved to California, I bought a saw, and I started make -- making things.

            "answer": "Yes, I -- I have not travel -- after my retirement in \u201991 -- in 90, sorry, even -- I did not agonize very much about what I was going to do, I know many people who are approaching that age, or -- or time, they say oh, what am I going to do afterwards? Well, I thought for a little while, but then I said all right, P'Il try to do whatever interests me, and -- and if I begin to climb walls in the -- Pl -- P'Il think of [indecipherable] then. All right. First of all, I was asked by my former boss to consult for another year for the company, because there was still a piece of work that I had started, that was unfinished, and he was not planning to replace my position. So I did that for a year. Then, coincidentally a friend of mine, a Greek who was working for the European community, asked me and told me that they needed consultants for work which was being funded by the European community, but which dealt with telecommunications, and it\u2019s future in Greece. I mean the telecommunication system. So for four years, I traveled. I was practically on the plane every other month, through Europe, throughout Europe. I -- \u2019'm no -- I\u2019m talking about the east, but primarily the western part of Europe, and Greece, doing this consulting work. Then a year after that, a big project that I started had come to a reasonable stopping point, and we had had the Irish telecommunications company, that which led me to go to Ireland a number of times, which I -- both Paulette and I love. Then we went to Israel. I have lots of relatives there, who had migrated -- some of them migrated in the early 30\u2019s from Salonika to Israel. So there\u2019s a -- a lot of progeny that\u2019s -- that\u2019s now in -- in the tents. Plus also some cousins, among them Miriam, her last name is Kalahora, who was one of about an estimated 1500 Jews who were able to escape from Greece via boat to Turkey, and then go from Turkey, through Syria, and Lebanon, eventually to Palestine. Now some of them, and her sister, either -- I mean, drowned, that\u2019s for sure. What 1s not known is whether they were drowned by the boatman to take their money and -- and essentially kill them. Some of them were captured by the Germans, by some patrol boats. Some were also denounced. But one of them made it. But 1500 made it to -- to Turkey, to Palestine."

            "question": "Yes.",
            "answer": "-- and eventually it was published, and they are known as the Danuta Chronicles. Well, you look at entries day by day as they -- they are there. Sometimes they are from the sublime or the horrible, to the terribly mundane. For instance, okay, today 15,000 arrived and were taken to the crematoria. And then this individual was punished with 10 lashes because he stole a piece of bread. I mean, these are the kinds of extremes of entries. Well, all right. Since I knew the approximate period, then I find an entry for 16 August of \u201944, where he says, \u201c1600 or 2000 Rhodesian Jews come.\u201d Then he says how -- so many males, so many females. Not of the total, but so many females were given numbers, and he has the range of the numbers, and the females were given the following numbers. And I knew from Sam\u2019s number on his arm fits exactly in the range that he\u2019s -- he cited there. So I know now that the date of the arrival, and when I asked Sam at what time of the day they arrived, he said, \u201cVery early, dawn.\u201d And that makes me conclude that either they -- they were executed or -- or gassed the same day, because they didn\u2019t keep them around, or at the latest, the following day. So that was the first thing. So I -- I did a little bit more of this personal kind of a thing. What drove me then to the later engagement, which would -- then became intense, was a similar thing. I always -- I -- although I knew the fate of my relatives in Macedonia, in mon -- in Monasteer, but especially in s -- in s -- the Serbian Jews, in Serbia, very few ever reached the concentration camps. And now not that much had been written, so I was beginning to get really curious, so I began to -- to read some sources. Now I know the Germans shot most of the Serbian Jews and buried them, or used mobile gas vans. It was before the killing factories began to operate. Well, then I found in a book that the Bulgarians who occupied Macedonia and Phrase, among other things, and -- and this book which is called, \u201cA Town called Monasteer,\u201d makes the following assertion. That in the archives of Yad Vashem, there is a unique -- a -- 0 -- a -- an item unique to the Holocaust. But emphatically Pve concluded there is nothing unique about the Holocaust, everything is unique about the Holocaust. And so I contacted Yad Vashem, eventually I got the microfilm, it came. But then, while I\u2019m waiting for that, I thought I would to go the archives, and I asked Sharon there innocently, do you have anything from Monasteer? Yes, we have 1400 photographs. Well, here is two huge books, but you couldn\u2019t -- th-they were just only photographs with numbers, no identification. But together there was two rolls of 35 millimeter microfilm, so you take the books to the library, put the -- thread the thing in the reader, and every frame has the same number as the photograph, and written in handwritten Cyrillic was the identity and address of these persons. Well, very quickly, the first day, I advance the microfilm to my relatives. Now though, since it\u2019s Cyrillic the first letter is k, then comes n, and at the end is f. There\u2019s Colonomos from my mother\u2019s brother, I found my aunt. My uncle Salamone Hamma, my father\u2019s brother, and my father\u2019s sister, Oro, who had married a man named Franco. Well, I took copies of it, I -- I came home. I was a bit moved by this discovery. Okay, marvelous things over the weekend, and then the following Monday I called the archives, and it was Sharon, she says, \u201cWell, Mr. Nehama, you know, we wanted to call you, but I was hesitating, and,\u201d -- I said, \u201cLook, let me tell you why I\u2019m calling. Since I was able to read about my [indecipherable] perhaps maybe I can help.\u201d She said, \u201cThat\u2019s what we were going to ask you too, if you would be willing to.\u201d And that\u2019s what got me started, and -- and that -- that initial piece of work took almost a year, because now, for the first six months, I would go the museum carrying my portable computer, and get the books, get the microfilm, sit in front of a reader, and as I read -- and some of these things are sometimes unreadable, I would then transfer them to the computer. Then one day it dawned on me that instead of trudging and getting all these things to the museum, maybe I would rent a microfilm reader, and bring it here to my house, and I don\u2019t have to -- to travel. But immediately then I thought, there is a button on the microfilm reader, and if you press it, 1t gives you a copy out of the printer. Well, that means that the stupid thing goes out digitally so that the printer can print it. If it goes out to the printer, it can sure go to a CD. So I took the -- the microfilm, and I paid a co -- a company, and they transferred onto -- on one -- on a CD, so I did the remaining other four or five months at home. Then after that was finished, the -- the archives, the photo archives, I did the same thing with the Yad Vashem register, which is even more difficult, because, you know, even if you magnify, it begins to get distorted, but I can show you later, you can even see that different clerks were writing, because you can see that the handwriting is changing over time. And it -- it was a-another almost eight or nine months of very eye breaking e-e-effort to -- to do the Yad Vashem thing. But it was --"

A few years ago, the -- after my first grandson was -- was born, Ian, then I said, all right, there will come a time where, like everyone will -- will ask, wh-what is relativity about? So -- so I put together a little handmade illustration like a film, that explains, I thought -- explains relativity -- special relativity, not general relativity to a child. The truth is that it requires a little bit more sophistication, although children grasp things much more quickly, because they don\u2019t carry terrible baggage that they have to discard first. But there are certain aspects of special relativity that one has to be able to at least make a leap of [indecipherable] because one thing to which special relativity is key, namely the velocity of light, we cannot experience it. You can only think about it, and the -- in fact there have been books that tell you, supposing the velocity of light was not what it is. Suppose it was on -- an every day kind of speed, like you drive you car -- say speed of light was 30 miles per hour. What would happen? You -- you go out in the street, and -- and you see a person in a bicycle, and as he moves, you would see him squashed, because it\u2019s one of the lengths in -- in -- in a -- in a direction of travel shrink because that\u2019s one of the aspects of -- of special relativity. But because you can\u2019t make -- you know, but -- so you have to be able to imagine this thing, and then -- but I made this film, so I\u2019m waiting for a time when my grandsons would begin to ask questions about the relativity, or about mathematics, and either I will make films for them, or -- or tell them, or tell them other stories. Because I remember from childhood I would be fascinated I had certain heroes. Ulysses was one of them, or Odysseus. Or -- or Hercules, or Eracles. Then later on, in the be -- when I started -- another hero was Alexander the Great. Now in subsequent reading now, I have concluded he was a thug in many respects.

But there were also some byproducts, if I can call them, which really would last a lot longer, because in the process I came into contact with individuals of similar interests. There\u2019s a matter of me corresponding with -- his name 1s Moses Hasson, he lives in Santiago, Chile, because the people from Monasteer were early settlers in 1916 in a small town called Temooko, in the lake district in Chile. And -- and was one of the oldest Sephardic as well as monastilee communities in South America. Then I -- I met -- and I have not met yet in person, a man who wrote a book about Monasteer, his name is Mark Cohen, he lives in San Francisco area. And it was through Mark\u2019s researchers that I found, and I fe -- I have copies now of reasons the s -- s -- the declaration of 16 prominent Mo-Monasteer Jews, among them my great-grandfather Solomon, to establish the alliance fran\u00a2aise in- in Monasteer. Then in 1924, my grandfather, Isaac, whose name I bear, was the president of the Monasteer communit -- the Jewish community of Monasteer, and we have a facsimile of his letter from Yale, in Yale, where\u2019s he\u2019s addressing the illion israllitany versell in Paris, thanking them for the donations of clothing and money to the Jews of Monasteer who had been severely -- suffered through fierce bombardment during the first World War, to almost the total destruction of Jewish homes. Then -- then my uncle Solomon was the secretary of the Joint Distribution Committee in Monasteer, thanking the Jews of America for a shipment of clothing. All of that, in addition to being gratifying that -- that I -- I -- I have some lineage of people who gave something to the community, which reminded me of a thing my father would tell me when I was growing up, that human beings, in their infancy, for self preservation are very selfish. They don\u2019t think about anybody else. Then they go to school, they meet other people, so they begin to share. When they have a family, they begin to give to others. But some people stop there. Now, very few people begin to give to a larger circle, namely their immediate community. Still fewer give to even larger circle, the country to which they belong. And finally, extremely few, maybe one in million, give to the entire world. So the idea of -- of giving back harks back -- and I don\u2019t know whether my father was saying it because of the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the history that he knew of the environment of his own ancestors in community affairs. So \u2019m glad that -- that -- that to some extent -- and I also believe that there is a kind of a ledger that somebody keeps, and so I -- I like to make the books balance. So that\u2019s the kind of -- of reward that the work is -- that I\u2019ve done represents, and then finally that I may be able, both through the video recording, as well as the audio recording, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- sort of relieves me from something else that my children have been asking me insistently to do, to write my memoirs. So at least I -- 1f -- 1f I only write certain other parts, and I don\u2019t write others, as least there will still be part of the record that they can refer to, 1f they choose to, after I\u2019m gone.
