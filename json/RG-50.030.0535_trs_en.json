And she had two brothers, and t-two sisters. And they owned a \u2014 a farm of cattle, a cattle farm up there. But \u2014 and of course in Latvia there was a \u2014 a certain amount of Jewish population. And that way Latvia also was a \u2014 belonged to Russia, but before it belonged to Russia, was a part of Germany, was a colony of Germany. And the people spoke German, and later they learned Russian from the Russian occupation, or beca \u2014 the Russian got the \u2014 got the territory. And she \u2014 her \u2014 they were Selling cattle to Finland and Sweden and everywhere. But then the \u2014 the tsar of Russia had a brother and his name was Peter.

So Peter decided, with his brother, the tsar of Russia, they decided to \u2014 to take the Jews and send them to the other part of Russia by the [-Iranian border, by the Caspian Sea, by Azrahan(ph), by Baku, Azrahan(ph). And they were sent there. And up there they \u2014 they started a new life, with different businesses to survive.
