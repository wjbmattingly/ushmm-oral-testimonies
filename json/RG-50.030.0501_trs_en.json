Anyway, they took a hostage in the village, a poor guy that had come back from work and had gone to see his parents. And they thought he was a terrorist also, and they tied him up, I fo -- found out later on, on the back of a horse drawn carriage, and dragged him to his death. He was dead. There was one captain that was apparently a -- a -- a [indecipherable] one, and he\u2122s the one that got all of this. There was one lieutenant apparently, in the German outfit that when they tried to shoot some -- one of the civilians that were there, called Commanda nt, Commandant. Our 125 Commandant was over there, he asked what was going on, so he said, don\u2122t shoot the civilians. So you know, this is -- we found out afterwards. Anyway, we had to have more help. So our captain sent a motorcycle -- m-motorcycle -- moto rcyclist to the headquarter of Bank and said we need some support. And Bank immediately called up by radio -- there was a carrier -- aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean, and he asked for a-assistance. And they said they will send two planes. And th-the message came back to us, they will be there in half an hour, and it took about an hour, but anyway the two planes came in, machine gunned the Germans. They came in very low, just [indecipherable] circled, and they machine-gunned them. And that slowed the Germans down, and we had time to pull back, because we had to -- we could not hold the positions any more. At that time the Germans -- when the planes left -- we were stupid, too. When the planes were over, we got very excited and we took out hankies and we waved at them, you know? That was a bad move because Germans saw where we were, our positions. As soon as the planes left we got hit by artillery you wouldn\u2122t believe. I mean, it came down ra ining like anything. And apparently my brother was killed there, but I did not know that at the time. The captain ordered us to pull back, and on the way down the lieutenant said, \ufb01Fred, we need you down by the car.\ufb02 There -- there was a -- a [indecipherable] parked [indecipherable] and when we got on there he says, \ufb01Max is dead.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01What? What ha ppened?\ufb02 We -- we were close by, but there was a hill and he was on one side, at a [indecipherable], a nd I didn\u2122t see it. The bi -- shells -- the shells were falling all over the place. And he says yes - and he say -- and I -- when I moved to go back, he -- he -- he stopped me . And he put me in the car and drove me home -- to the next village. Next morning we go back, there was one of our men had been left behind. He apparently could not follow us, and he had 29 Russian prisoners with him. And how do you do that? He says, well, I saw them over there, and they were tr ying to hide, and there I was, so I point to them 126 [indecipherable] and they surrendered. So we got close to them -- because they wanted to surrender, they didn\u2122t want to fight with the Germans any more. So when we got close, then lined up and my lieutenant -- there\u2122 s a difference between lieutenant and the captain, they always interchange you know, whoever was in charge at the time. So my lieutenan t tries to speak to them, he doesn\u2122t speak Russian, and I don\u2122t speak Russian either. And then this Russian soldier goes, heil Hitler. And I take my rifle [indecipher able] and kill him. So my lieutenant puts my rifle down, and the Russian\u2122s leader tells him, no, th is is -- salute this way, not this way. He was lucky, he nearly got killed over there. But I understand, I mean, he did not know, you know, there was -- there were -- leaders, many of them di dn\u2122t know what the heil Hitler meant to a -- to the French. And then we went -- during the night, more had surrendered, and we had captured a total of about 300 [indecipherable] citation from the German, 300 prisoners.
