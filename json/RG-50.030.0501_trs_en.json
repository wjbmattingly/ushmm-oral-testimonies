Anyway, they took a hostage in the village, a poor guy that had come back from work and had gone to see his parents. And they thought he was a terrorist also, and they tied him up, I fo -- found out later on, on the back of a horse drawn carriage, and dragged him to his death. He was dead. There was one captain that was apparently a -- a -- a [indecipherable] one, and he\u2019s the one that got all of this. There was one lieutenant apparently, in the German outfit that when they tried to shoot some -- one of the civilians that were there, called Commandant, Commandant. Our 5 Commandant was over there, he asked what was going on, so he said, don\u2019t shoot the civilians. So you know, this is -- we found out afterwards. Anyway, we had to have more help. So our captain sent a motorcycle -- m-motorcycle -- motorcyclist to the headquarter of Bank and said we need some support. And Bank immediately called up by radio -- there was a carrier -- aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean, and he asked for a-assistance. And they said they will send two planes. And th-the message came back to us, they will be there in half an hour, and it took about an hour, but anyway the two planes came in, machine gunned the Germans. They came in very low, just [indecipherable] circled, and they machine-gunned them. And that slowed the Germans down, and we had time to pull back, because we had to -- we could not hold the positions any more. At that time the Germans -- when the planes left -- we were stupid, too. When the planes were over, we got very excited and we took out hankies and we waved at them, you know? That was a bad move because Germans saw where we were, our positions. As soon as the planes left we got hit by artillery you wouldn\u2019t believe. I mean, 1t came down raining like anything. And apparently my brother was killed there, but I did not know that at the time. The captain ordered us to pull back, and on the way down the lieutenant said, \u201cFred, we need you down by the car.\u201d There -- there was a -- a [indecipherable] parked [indecipherable] and when we got on there he says, \u201cMax is dead.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat? What happened?\u201d We -- we were close by, but there was a hill and he was on one side, at a [indecipherable], and I didn\u2019t see it. The bi -- shells -- the shells were falling all over the place. And he says yes -- and he say -- and I -- when I moved to go back, he -- he -- he stopped me. And he put me in the car and drove me home -- to the next village. Next morning we go back, there was one of our men had been left behind. He apparently could not follow us, and he had 29 Russian prisoners with him. And how do you do that? He says, well, I saw them over there, and they were trying to hide, and there I was, so I point to them 6 [indecipherable] and they surrendered. So we got close to them -- because they wanted to surrender, they didn\u2019t want to fight with the Germans any more. So when we got close, then lined up and my lieutenant -- there\u2019s a difference between lieutenant and the captain, they always interchange you know, whoever was in charge at the time. So my lieutenant tries to speak to them, he doesn\u2019t speak Russian, and I don\u2019t speak Russian either. And then this Russian soldier goes, heil Hitler. And I take my rifle [indecipherable] and kill him. So my lieutenant puts my rifle down, and the Russian\u2019s leader tells him, no, this is -- salute this way, not this way. He was lucky, he nearly got killed over there. But I understand, I mean, he did not know, you know, there was -- there were -- leaders, many of them didn\u2019t know what the heil Hitler meant to a -- to the French. And then we went -- during the night, more had surrendered, and we had captured a total of about 300 [indecipherable] citation from the German, 300 prisoners. And some surrendered in the morning, some had gone to the next village and surrendered over there. So we captured all of them. Couldn\u2019t believe it. N-Not many Germans, all Russians, yeah."

Your apartment, I want it. Il give you one month to find another apartment.\u201d I said, he had collaborated with the Germans and he wants me to give him the apartment? No way. A month goes by, \u201cLoewy, have you found something?\u201d I said no. He said, \u201cI'll find something for you.\u201d So he finds something and he says, 1 \u201cLoewy, I want you to move out.\u201d I said, \u201cI refuse.\u201d \u201cYou what?\u201d He\u2019s -- what happened then?

The next day he says -- he calls me up in secret because clearly I wasn\u2019t supposed to know what\u2019s going on there. He says, \u201cNow they are trying to send you to Vietnam -- Indo-China.\u201d Not Vietnam, Indo-China. I says, time for me to get out of the army. So I had signed up for the army for the duration of the war, and why I did this, I put down in ink, in Europe. So the war is over in Europe. So nothing happens, nu -- so I figure they are going to send me out before I have a chance to get out of the army. So I send a letter to the general, \u201c\u201cGeneral, I demand my discharge.\u201d Nothing happens. So I just had to go one 2 step higher.
