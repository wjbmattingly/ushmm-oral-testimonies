And then, you know, I heard that there is a job on a farm, to milk the cows, to help with the far \u0152 I was all used to farm like \u0152 now I would go, maybe as astronaut I would be better. So I went there and there was a wife after a \u0152 a \u0152 a widow after a judge and a big farm. And she said to me , do you know how to milk the cow? I figured, what\u2122s a \u0152 wha-what\u2122s so easy th \u0152 bi-big deal, you know? I was wearing silk stockings, and my Polish was so go od and my handwriting was so good. You know, for a maid in Poland, who were mostly illiterate, but I told them that I was working as a bookkeeper in this different city. So now I \u0152 since I moved, my parents die, everybody, you know, to convenience. Sometimes they were alive, sometimes they were dead. And she says okay, so milk this cow. I started to pull, kill me, couldn\u2122t get a drop of milk and the flies were biting me through the stockings and the cow was hitting me with the tail. And \u0152 and she looked at me, she said, you don\u2122t look like a girl who knows \u0152 who was working on a farm. I am sorry, but I cannot keep you. I left again. In between there, there were jobs where I felt that this is not safe, that I have to leave, you know. So after two days I was leaving without, you know, and I didn't \u0152 I had working papers, which we re extremely important. By Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 31the way, I forgot to tell you, when I was going to get my Kennekarta (ph) with my birth certificate, which I got to my hand \u0152 End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B ",
                " \u0152 I got my false paper, I needed a Kennkarta , which was the official germ \u0152 German document to live in occupied Poland. And when I went on the way there to this German office where they were giving the Kennkarta with my picture, I had a picture with my nose like this, I \u0152 you will see the picture. And on the way there somebody stole from me the \u0152 the \u0152 my po cketbook. And I didn\u2122t have the birth certificate. And I called up this man, Mr. Rokulski(ph), he said, I cannot get \u0152 you have to go to the Church of che \u0152 of Three Crosses, that was a big church in Poland, and ask for the birth certificate. I didn\u2122t ha ve a choice, this was like \u0152 like going in a \u0152 in a mousetrap and I went there and I as k and they gave me. I don\u2122t know if she was alive or she was dead, you know? Could be if I would ask for death certificate, they would give me too. So again I went and I got the Kennkarta which w \u0152 and a arbeitskarta , work paper, which was extremely important because when the Germans were stopping me, when I had the arbeitkarta, this work karta , they let me loose. My dream was to get to Germany, to work in Germany as a Polish girl. However, you couldn\u2122t volunteer, because if they would see a woman like me Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 32volunteer, there was a priest who was spec ializing in recognizing Jews. He would see right away that the woman, you know, with my Polish, is not voluntary to go to work as a \u0152 in labor camp. So my only hope was to be caught by the German, and to send to Germany . But because of my arbeitkarta, they never \u0152 I went to library, the ju \u0152 Gestapo came to library. I showed them my paper, they let me loose. And \u0152 "

It was one day when the Germans left, and the Russian didn\u2122t come. I will never forget this day. And it was a awful day, you know, because here I am, I don\u2122t have to fight for my life, I don\u2122t have anybody. And why I survive? What was the purpose?

Do you know this family, the other fam \u0152 I didn\u2122t know anybody. And \u0152 and they said, and where are you staying? I said, I think, because it was a whole block, that this is Zamenhof [indecipherable]. And th-they said, describe to me how the house was looking. And I went to Jewish committee, which was on Praga, on the other side of Vistula river, and I register, and people started \u0152 nobody yet was coming from Russia, because later \u0152 nobody yet was coming from concentration camp because it was later. Lublin, however, was liberated. Have a \u0152 you see, if I would be on Praga, I would be liberated in August when the Russian came. But since they stopped, and so many Jews were killed in those few months. So this was my liberation."

And then when it came the time for psychotropic drugs, you kno w, they started to give them, and \u0152 and then they started to discharge them to nursing home which were worse than hell. And it \u0152 through all those years I did lots of growing you know, between the war and between my work, you know, I became extremely \u0152 much more tolerant and \u0152 and a much better person than I ever would be, even not all those things.
