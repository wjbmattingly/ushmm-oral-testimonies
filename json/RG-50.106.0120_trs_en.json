And I was two years in law school, which I didn\u2019t finish because it was in subject that it was ancient law and middle age law which appealed to me. And then for a \u2014 before the war started, I was helping my father in his factory, where I was typing a little bit, doing some bookkeeping, but nothing to get excited. And then the war started \u2014"

And I went to a well known psychiatrist and he said your son maybe is right, however he doesn\u2019t know that you were a grown up person when it happened. You will never bury them, you will live as [indecipherable] sister. I don\u2019t think that [indecipherable] that I don\u2019t remember my sister."

Even with a strong club, that would happen. This is the way I feel. And the more, you know, and \u2014 and I was maybe selfish because I wanted to save my own feelings. I didn\u2019t want to come and to talk and to dig out and then \u2014 but at certain moment it was pressure from our son, too, who 1s a psychiatrist, so \u2014 and he said, I remember the holidays and always you were crying. You know, when Passover, it was Seder or something like this. And \u2014 and you were always talking how was it, you know, and \u2014 and the memories and he said now \u2014 now that we have holidays, mostly we\u2019re going to her \u2014 to my daughter- Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Romana Koplewicz \u201d October 8, 1993 in-law parents, which are second generate \u2014 first gen \u2014 her parents were \u2014 her parents were from Hungary or Romania and he 1s too, but they are totally Americanized, very well-to-do people. And \u2014 and they ha \u2014 nobody cries, nobody talks about anything. Th-Th \u2014 different story. However, we\u2019re going for the second Seder to a young couple whose father was an editor of Jewish [indecipherable]. And she reads in Yiddish, you know, about the [indecipherable] ghetto and my son writes in English. And it has a meaning, you know? I became more, not religious, only more traditional, you know, yeah. And I feel this is very little ah \u2014 I wou \u2014 if \u2014 if my son wouldn\u2019t be born here, we wouldn\u2019t circumcise him most likely. And anyway, he was circumcised by the doctor, not by a moyl. A-And \u2014 however, he \u2014 now that I have three grandson, wonderful three boys, and I-I would like \u2014 I would like a ni \u2014 and I don\u2019t know if I would like because for example, after the war, that I didn\u2019t know that my husband survive or no, I could never marry the Gentile. And many people just drop \u2014 they said \u2014 which, you cannot blame them, decided enough of being Jewish. When I decided to go back to school, you know, I didn\u2019t know \u2014 I \u2014 I wanted to be a librarian because I liked to read, but then I was discouraged. And then after thinking over and between my husband and my son, you know, they said that I\u2014I\u2014I-\u2014I should help people, you know. So I was working, when I got my Master\u2019s degree in a state mental institution for 13 years, which wasn\u2019t that Interview with Romana Koplewicz * October 8, 1993 rewarding because I couldn\u2019t do too much for them and you need some happy ending. But I \u2014 even there, I was exposed to tremendous suffering, which to compare to my, you know, those were people which were out, totally. They di \u2014 they didn\u2019t know what \u2014 they were for 50 years in a mental institution. And then when it came the time for psychotropic drugs, you know, they started to give them, and \u2014 and then they started to discharge them to nursing home which were worse than hell. And it \u2014 through all those years I did lots of growing you know, between the war and between my work, you know, I became extremely \u2014 much more tolerant and \u2014 and a much better person than I ever would be, even not all those things.

I had so many dreams which were never fulfilled, and I didn\u2019t realize, maybe because I was stupid, or young, that so many things were off the limits for us Jews in Poland. They were talking about engineers jokingly, that they are to measure the street. The doctors, if they didn\u2019t marry the rich girl, he couldn\u2019t open the office. Lawyers, the bar were closed for Jewish lawyers, young one. A Jew couldn't be a janitor, a Jew couldn\u2019t be a chimney cleaner. A Jew couldn\u2019t get a city job. And now living here for 44 years and to see what the opportunities everybody can have, I am for sure reinforce that it was the wrong place of birth for us.
