So, it is true that we stayed alive with one potato, I don\u2019t know by what miracle we did stay alive, but like I said, to the end, we couldn\u2019t walk any more. Went in in the barrack to lay down, and to die. This is when liberation came. I was really also sick with typhoid fever, but I had sort of the walking around typhoid fever. I wasn\u2019t that severe, my sister was. She had to be taken away to a hospital, and she was very, very ill. When -- When she got well, I could hardly recognize her. She looked worse than the people that were dead in the camp. But somehow, you see, we survived, and we didn\u2019t find anyone of our family.

But I was never one of the brave, to go and risk like that. I was a very timid girl, and I -- I would say the honest truth, my sister was the organizer. If it wouldn\u2019t be for her, maybe I wouldn\u2019t be alive, because she worked in a different place, where she had more access to food.
