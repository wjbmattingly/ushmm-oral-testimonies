But this labor camp was a sub- camp of Neuengamme. And it -- Neuengamme was an extermination camp, everybody knows that, but somehow we got transported to Bergen-Belsen, with this piece of bread yet. So we ate first this bread, and then this potato, but it was just impossible to -- you know, we were losing our strength, and could barely walk. So, it is true that we stayed alive with one potato, I don\u2019t know by what miracle we did stay alive, but like I said, to the end, we couldn\u2019t walk any more. Went in in the barrack to lay down, and to die. This is when liberation came. I was really also sick with typhoid fever, but I had sort of the walking around typhoid fever. I wasn\u2019t that severe, my sister was. She had to be taken away to a hospital, and she was very, very ill. When -- When she got well, I could hardly recognize her. She looked worse than the people that were dead in the camp. But somehow, you see, we survived, and we didn\u2019t find anyone of our family. It was very heartbreaking, and at this point it seems pointless to live. There was nothing to go on for."

I don\u2019t know where my sister got the strength to come back and grab me by my arm, and tell me, \u201cGet up, you have to see what -- what is out there.\u201d It was unbelievable.

But that\u2019s supposed to have been the people\u2019s food. It was warm in April, you know. The sun was beating down on that. The kohlrabi was decomposed. People were risking their lives, actually, trying to get one, and they were shot. They were shot to death, almost on the minute of liberation, because they were so desperate to get this. But I was never one of the brave, to go and risk like that. I was a very timid girl, and I -- I would say the honest truth, my sister was the organizer. If it wouldn\u2019t be for her, maybe I wouldn\u2019t be alive, because she worked in a different place, where she had more access to food.

Like it says in my interview, next to a radar station, we could hear that radar turning and beeping, and the sirens going on. They were here. We could -- We could hear the bombs flying, and everything. And the city of Hamburg was one rubble on top of the other. That\u2019s the way it looked.

We were also the same way hungry, but my sister and I, my friends, we never ate the whole portion, we always divided it, because I wanted to have the reassurance that I have something to eat for later. We knew nothing else was coming. St -- On the -- On the bowshtella we -- we never got anything unless we worked -- one time -- you worked for a couple weeks in a village across the Elba. The village was called Kronst, and we were loading bricks on a boat. But that was also -- you had to be lucky to be picked for this. You see, we were fighting -- everybody was fighting to go to the village, because the local people brought food for us, and there was more to eat, so 1t was a great big fight in the morning to get first in line, to be picked for this place.

Not enough doctors, and do you know, the German population from around, they were forced to come into the camp and see all this. And the English needed help with the sick people, those nurses, the local nurses didn't even want to come in, they had to be brought in at gunpoint. They didn\u2019t want to come and help the sick people. It took me a long time to find my sister in those buildings. I didn\u2019t know where they took her. Finally I found her, and there she was on the floor laying and holding a -- a rag with cold water to her head, and she said, last night the doctor said to her -- he looked at her, and he said, \u201cThis woman has the crisis tonight. If she\u2019s al -- If she survives, she\u2019Il be alive tomorrow morning.\u201d She said, \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep a whole night, I wanted to die with my eyes open.\u201d Here I come in the morning, and thank God she was alive.

In Europe it\u2019s entirely different. It\u2019s not like here, you know. I -- I don\u2019t know how to describe, but everything was in canvas sacks, you know. You had a scale, and bags, and people came, and said, \u201cGive me a half a pound.\u201d So you took -- took a bag out, and took it out of the sack, and weigh it, and just give it to the people. But they got to get on in age, and th -- it was hard for them. You d -- had no people working for you, if you wanted to make a living, you had to do everything yourself. So they sold that little grocery store, and both came to live with us, grandpa and grandma. Grandpa died right before the war, about two or three years before the war, and grandma un -- when they came to live with us, she sort of took over the kitchen. She was used to always being busy, and my mom was very distressed about it, because my father\u2019s workshop was sort of divided between the kitchen and his workshop. So she used to say, \u201cMom, what are you doing? People come up and they think I made a maid out of you.\u201d And she used to say, \u201cWhat am I supposed to do, sit down and die? Don\u2019t be silly.\u201d So my mom used to say, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you let at least the girls help you with the dishes?\u201d She said, \u201cOch, let them go and play. When they get married, they\u2019Il do plenty dishes.\u201d So that was, you know? And then in wintry nights, we used to sit around in the evening, my grandpa used to tell stories about sages, and learned man, all these cert -- also certain fables, or we used to play -- of all the things we used to play in winter, Bingo, or cards we used to play, with the children, it was like a game. The s -- And neighbors used to come up, and have like a neighborhood klatch, you know? It was always -- our house was always full of company. People used to come, and even during the war, when they occupied, and we were still in our own apartment, my father was forced to -- to work for the Germans because he was about the only craftsman in our little place, and you had to do what they told you, you know, otherwise they shoot -- they come -- they come, my father had to repair their watches. They -- They brought gold pieces that they robbed all these big farm -- rich farms. My father had to melt them down and make bracelets, and rings, and whatnot, all that they send into Germany. And so we had -- we had to work for them. A lot of them were real bad, but there were -- there was a single one among them that would bring some bread, or whatever, which was very helpful in those times. But still, the neighbors -- and there was a lot of people that had no food any more, and whatever we had, people used to come up, and we had a big bench, and a table on the side, whatever we cooked, we always used to share with everybody. I-It\u2019s not something that I\u2019m trying to tell you because I won\u2019t get a medal for it, but that\u2019s the way it was in our house, we used to share everything we had."

We had an infirmary, I went to this, there was a Czech woman, also prisoner. She just digged around and digged around and -- with nothing, and couldn\u2019t find anything. At that time we had an Obersharfuthrer who was crazy about us being healthy. He didn\u2019t care about food or anything, just healthy. So at that time, three of us were sick, so he took the three of us, with a German SS woman, and there was one of -- always picked the altesta from our own people, and they took us into the city. Well, that camp was in Zazell, and they took us into the city of Hamburg. I -- The only thing I know, that we went into a prisoner of war camp. I don\u2019t know to this day if it was French or Czech, or -- or Italian, or Czech, or whatever it was, I have no idea, because I couldn\u2019t recognize the language. And this doctor, when my -- they had a doctor there, also prisoner. When my turn came, he looked at my finger, and he pointed, and then he pointed at the plain wooden table, pointed that I should lay down. Stretched out myself, and he poured from a bottle ether on my face -- just plain ether. I was choking, bells were ringing in my ears, and I thought I was dead. This is it, I\u2019m dying, I gave up. But when I woke up, I was sitting already, and my finger was bandaged. And afterwards, they changed my bandages in camp, then I could see what it looked like, my finger was like separated in half. My whole nail was gone, and there was a piece, they cut off there a piece. But I healed ver -- very, very slowly. I had to go to work with all that. So, we had ups and downs in the camp, you know? There were some that cared, again, for food, but didn\u2019t care for our welfare. These- They called them the Obersharfihrer, that the camp, tha -- from the SS that administered the camp, and we had a few that were real vicious, too. We had SS women also, and they were even worse than the men."

And my husband, after awhile they used to get some German marks from the German government, like from the state where we were, Bavarian state, they used to get some German marks, because they sort of were on a pilung of a police department, or whatever they called it, after awhile. And in the beginning, there was no -- no talk of anything, because we still tried to figure out where are we, what do we supposed to be doing? Then later on, of course no one wanted to stay. People had relatives overseas, they sent papers for them, and this is what made us think what are -- what is going to be our future? What are we going to do? We did -- We didn\u2019t see any way out.

People were much closer in families than they are now. Children and parents were together, things were done together, and I was always invited to people\u2019s homes, and to dinners, and stuff like that. Everybody sat down at the table, the children were there, our children were there. And s - Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection \u00a7 -- conversing afterwards. So it was like ri -- somehow, the family that we didn\u2019t have, it was compensating very much. The only hard time was when it came to our holidays. So, it was very hard to take, because you sat at the table, and you thought of the wonderful times you had at home, surrounded by everybody, and by all the tradition. And all of a sudden, all of this is gone, and that\u2019s what it is, hard facts of life."

I just -- I don\u2019t know. I know one thing, when we get old, we survivors who think time is running too fast for us, we try to do so much more, to be -- that 1t should be left behind. You -- You know, my two daughters never got married, I don\u2019t have any grandchildren, it\u2019s hard to take this. They just elected to be career women. Yeah, I would like to have some grandchildren, somebody left to remember everything, but then I compensate myself at the mind that all of this is recorded, and some people will know about it anyway. So this -- I think this is a very good thing that is happening to me. And many schools also tape me, and they have that on their files. And I go, for the fourth time, I went to Milwaukee, to Marquette University. And they always tape it, they considered this a lecture. And every year, when I come, they make a tape of whatever I say, and they file in their files there, so that -- that\u2019s something that I think is very good."
