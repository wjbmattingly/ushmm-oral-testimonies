My f -- my family was always poor. I don\u2122t know what my father actually learned. He was born in 1886, he must have had some sort of profession before the war, he certainly didn\u2122t have any profession afterwards. It was very hard going, he was a s-salesman of some sort, or something like that. And in 1923, there was a inflation in -- in Germany, and the -- hyper inflation, was very, very hard. Later on, he fulfilled his dream. He set up, I think with money from his parents, which would have come to -- wh-which he would have inherited, he set up a shoe repair shop, and he really -- that was the sort of thing he loved, doing things with his hands, although in Germany you -- you had to have certain people there who -- who learned the profession, but he worked there, and he liked it, and it was hard going, but Germany is terribly well organized. They even had certificates for people to repair their shoes, in way of Social Security, that was part of Social Security. So when he got permission to use these certificates, things were try -- were starting to pick up."

But if you were put in a line, and were told to keep still, and somebody hit you from the back on your head, and you turned round, that was almost fatal. There were two kinds of people who managed better than others. One were the wa -- the soldiers in the first World War, the others were the Communists. The Communists at least had an ideal, and knew what it was -- for what they were put into prison, or concentration camp. And the s-soldiers, former soldiers knew what discipline was, so they didn\u2122t turn around. So he wasn\u2122t treated as badly as some. Bad enough I\u2122m sure [indecipherable] and the fear was very great."

Now, there\u2122s no harm in this, if somebody tells you how to wash clothes. I can only advise you never to wash clothes like that. I didn\u2122t have any more skin on my fingers. I mean, my life has been saved, so I\u2122m not complaining, I\u2122m just telling you. In the morning my -- my fingers were all raw. I couldn\u2122t hardly do this, but I had to wash washing again. Do the washing again. For some reason which is not understandable, we\u2122re not given enough food. Not because there wasn\u2122t enough food, but because, I suppose, the matron, and the sister learned at some school or other, you give so many grams of these vegetable, so many grams of that vegetable, and so many grams of meat. I suppose that must be the case. And you didn\u2122t help yourself, you\u2122re -- just like David Copperfield, it was put on your plate, like this. I was always hungry there. Now, the other fellow nurses -- trainees, were also hungry. But they went into the larder in the evening, secretly, and took whatever they needed to satisfy their hunger. They didn\u2122t take me with them, but they said afterwards when it was found out, that it was me who had taken the food. I mean, that sort of thing I\u2122ve never encountered in my life.

I would have gone with them, I would have helped myself too, I was never a -- my English was as good as nonexistent [indecipherable] in those days, and yes, I remember there was -- we were sleeping all together, 10 or something like that.

Now, I wouldn\u2122t, if I live in a house where there -- a house where there\u2122s a wall, I wouldn\u2122t advise anybody to do this either, but I would have talked to the girl, and said don\u2122t -- please don\u2122t pin it up, makes hole in the wall. But it\u2122s just taken down, and -- and that sort of -- those sort of things were very bad to take. And I had -- I remember very clearly that I had to take care of 25 children who had a rest after lunch. And they were supposed to close their eyes and sleep, if possible, but at least keep quiet. Well, under my care they didn\u2122t keep quiet, and I didn\u2122t know how to ke -- let them -- how to manage to keep them quiet. So I shouted at them, and I remember very clearly that I always said, \ufb01Shut your eyeses.\ufb02 Which was a great success in the way of humoring them, and they thought it was very funny indeed. So that was a -- and I remember more. I remember that every two weeks -- it could have been every week, there was no reason why half of the trainees stayed over, and the other could leave for the weekend. But however -- before every -- before that half which had the weekend off could leave, the whole place had to be cleaned, washed. Now, after awhile I realize if I just throw water over the furniture, that\u2122ll do nicely, and get us off quickly. But I had thought that cleaning the place means taking off whatever dirt. So it took me -- I\u2122m always -- I\u2122ve always been slow, it took me ages to get it, and the others couldn\u2122t leave. So that didn\u2122t -- couldn\u2122t leave until everything was finished. So that -- that didn\u2122t make me much more popular either. On the other hand, there was a party at -- which wasn\u2122t very far, the people, Stevenson, I lived -- I had -- they had brought me over, didn\u2122t live very far. They had a party, and there was cake left over. And the rest of the cake was brought to me. I had a chauffer at that time. It never occurred to me, I wasn\u2122t brought up that way, it never occurred to me when I had the cake, not to vide it -- divide it among everybody in equal parts. So everybody had something, but they didn\u2122t take me into the larder with them. One of the things that had to be done to be a children\u2122s nurse 31 one day, is to knit -- to knit something for a child. Well, I would never finished it, because there was always some -- something wrong with it, and I have to try -- like Penelope, I always say to -- to [indecipherable] again, and start all over again. I would never meant -- made it. That war broke out in September, and the -- the children were evacuated, and the place closed down. So I went back to those -- to family Stevenson, and thought I was lucky, but then my hard time really started."

And I don\u2122t think we had much in common, but I can tell you one thing that might illustrate the coldness. I told you about our Christmas celebration. Well, in the beginning of December, or the middle of December, it was decided that the family was going away somewhere for Christmas. There was another maid in the house, she was also a Austrian refugee, but she didn\u2122t live 32 with the family, she came over as a maid. Everybody was going to leave the house, but the house couldn\u2122t be left alone. So it was decided that I should stay. So I stayed all alone over Christmas in the house. Snow was falling, to make it a picture. Well, when I learned that I couldn\u2122t leave, I couldn\u2122t go to my sister, to my relatives, I had the first nervous breakdown crying spell in my life. I couldn\u2122t stop myself. Afterwards, when it came to the 21st -- 24th of December, I\u2122d calmed down, but it was very, very hard. So that might illustrate the coldness."

Dr. Stevenson, who was a colonial Englishman, or Scotchman, stood up and -- when the national anthem was played. I remember that. And I remember the first bombing. I can\u2122t s -- on London, that was -- s -- what you would consider a small bomb nowadays, but made a lot of noise, and frightened terribly at that time, because it was a quite new experience. I was alone, this was on a Sunday morning, I was alone in 38 the house, and I was terrified. The bomb fell quite close. The first thing I did, I went in the kitchen, turned off the gas. I was told that. And then I went to the -- I -- I h -- I have these very vivid memories, I went to the mirror, and looked into the mirror and wanted to see how a person looks who\u2122s really terrified. Well, there was lots of broken glass about, and afterwards I had to sweep it up when the people came back. And that was that for the time being. But it cured me. I think I\u2122m perfectly honest in saying I was never afraid again. Things were quieting down, and the real bombing on London started when I was in London itself. I never went to a shelter, I slept in my bed, perfectly safe and sound -- no, safe I wouldn\u2122t say, but perfectly sound. I didn\u2122t hear anything. I inquired the next morning how the night has passed. On the othe r hand, I mention that always because it\u2122s - human nature is so strange. I lived in a -- by that time in a very old house, and there were mice around, and I was terrified of mi -- I -- I am terrified of mice. And they ran around in my room, and when they did this, I woke up. But at that time, I realized it didn\u2122t really matter to anybody whether I am alive or dead. So that gives you a sense of safety. I could never go through that again without being afraid. It didn\u2122t matter."

They called me to take care of his wife, and his two children. Well, so that anybody who is cool, calm and collected would be with them. Well, I went over, I slept there, and in the middle of the night the alarm sounded. So my aunt got up and called me, I didn\u2122t reply.

I\u2122m sitting on the lap of a lady who is probably the girlfriend of the gentleman who\u2122s lying down reading the paper. But the rest of the people I do not know, I haven\u2122t known before the picture was taken, and nobody ever will remember who the others are. But it was a habit in Germany at the time."
