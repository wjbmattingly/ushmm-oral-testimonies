My father lived in, as a child, lived in Wislica. In 1914 or 15, he enlisted in a Polish military unit which was conscripted eventually and served as part of the German army. And so in essence he became a soldier, fighting for Germany in World War I."

And he was awarded a, aS many were, an Iron Cross. And eventually for his service in the German cause, was given permission to become a German citizen. Actually became a citizen of Berlin. That\u2019s what the papers say. And so in about 1919 or 1920, I don\u2019t have the papers in front of me, he relocated and settled in Spandau in Berlin. When he was in Berlin, he undertook slowly a number of enterprising activities. By 1930 when I was born, he had already several haberdashery stores, several meaning two or three. He owned some property including an interest in a movie or cinema. And on my mother\u2019s side, Margaret, her family was in the egg business, wholesale egg distribution business. And I once recalled how they met. I can\u2019t remember for the moment now. But somehow they met and married in 1927 I think it was, 26 or 27."

My father would say a Shabbat with wine and there were as I recall occasional, I don\u2019t know how frequent, visits to the synagogue. And I would say my father was, was not, he certainly was not in the conservative rungs. I would say today you would say he was probably a, an observant Jew.

I would have been about six. And that was only because it was very dramatic. There were, there was a sandbox https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wolfgang Price 6 May 2, 2014 where my brother and another child were playing. And the other child dug, whatever it 1s, a rather deep hole in the sandbox and his head somehow got trapped in it and it was a tragic death. And I always remember that is sort of a starting point for all my memories. The other, I do recall quite vividly of course, I was in school and I was transferred from school. The story 1s well known.

That is this man Troutshold, my father\u2019s friend, was the one who rapped on the door and informed Margaret and Simon that something is up and that they were destroying the stores. And my father and my mother and I went down to the store that was closest to where we were living and when we got there the store had been in fact destroyed. There were people milling around and we spent the next hour salvaging things that the looters had left behind. And those are the things we ended up leaving the country with.

Except there were people milling around and the story eventually was pieced together so that I had an understanding that there were people who hated Jews and were destroying their property. It was a rather simplistic explanation but I was ten years old and my father had no reason to detail all, the nature of what was going on."

I can\u2019t say angst, but I can say that there was a lot of caution going https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wolfgang Price 10 May 2, 2014 out.

I don\u2019t think, I was not in on the decisions that led us to flee. We, in I think it was in April, just before the announcement that the German policy on letting Jews out changed.

So we managed just to be one of those who at the last minute was able to still get out. I can\u2019t remember what exactly month that German policy changed.

So when you had Easter time, there were all kinds of Easter figures that used to be fashioned. It\u2019s no longer fashionable to do those things. Maybe it is still in New York but I haven\u2019t seen that much any longer. But in those years store windows were highly decorated. And she had the knack of using chicken wire and old newspapers and painting the things. And when we moved in, with Willy. We lived with them for about five weeks, six weeks, in a room, they were already in business. I don\u2019t know how many employees they had. This business was underway.

            "answer": "No, well my, that was, well -- Willy was quite well to do, he was not quite generous and so there was soon, very soon the difficulty of earning a livelihood. We were spared because after the declaration of war, manpower was in short supply and in Long Island City which is not far away from Jackson Heights there were some small manufacturing facilities producing parts for among other things, tanks and submarines. And my father landed a job in a factory. I don\u2019t know exactly what parts he was making and why he was qualified for such work. But anyway he was https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wolfgang Price 24 May 2, 2014 employed and during the war period and we had an income. Meanwhile, of course I spent the war period getting through public school 69. And my brother was now three years behind me. And the interests were during this period, early period was learning how to play baseball. Everybody. And in my memoirs I wrote a little story about that. I can\u2019t remember in what year it was. I think it was shortly after my bar mitzvah. I had my 14\" birthday I guess it was. That would have been in 44. When I still had no, I didn\u2019t have a baseball mitt. And when you play baseball you need one. And I always had to borrow one. And typically the people who came up for bat didn\u2019t need a baseball mitt. They left it in the field and so I was able to take and use somebody else\u2019s mitt. But when I was, for this particular birthday, Willy was willing to be generous and he offered to buy me a baseball mitt. And so we went to a place called Davega. I don\u2019t know if you know what that is, but there was a famous chain of \u2014 and we went to Davega and at Davega they had a hundred baseball mitts all lined up on shelves. And of course, I was 14 and they all looked good. And I picked the biggest, nicest looking mitt and figured he would buy that and so I bought it or he bought it. And I was, of course, eager to use it on the field. And was somewhat disappointed when I realized that it didn\u2019t much help me. I had picked a catcher\u2019s mitt. So I picked a catcher\u2019s mitt, not because I wanted to be a catcher. I really didn\u2019t think. I wanted just the nicest looking mitt and this was the biggest nicest looking mitt on the shelf. Nobody told me that every position had its own mitt. And so for years I had that catcher\u2019s mitt which I could never really use. All right, my mother, when I went into the Korean War, my mother eventually got rid of that catcher\u2019s mitt."

In fact for the first, almost year or longer I did not live with the family in Jackson Heights. I was sent to live with a family in Vermont where I worked on a farm for French Canadians. And with a French Canadian family, they had a dairy farm. The money I earned was sent to my family and I was sort of an indentured young man, indentured laborer on a dairy farm.

And that would enable me to continue to go to school. And continue to earn money for the family. And that is what I did. Our, but you know, life has a way of surprising you and it turns out that Mr. Truman, President Truman decided that we have to escalate our activities in Korea.

It was the uranium boom period. I don\u2019t know if you remember that. And everybody was looking for this new material. And he had gone west to Utah where they were \u2014 and to New Mexico where there were sources of this material and he worked as an explorer and bought some Geiger counters and that started his career as a business man. He did surf \u2014 what was called a surface exploration. You just cover large areas of land by walking and later on when he had money, he bought a Jeep so he didn\u2019t have to walk. Searching for uranium. Clues for uranium deposits, but he left Margaret alone and when I got back things were difficult. So I needed a job and eventually landed a job with a firm called EF Drew. They still exist and I think they\u2019re listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Drew was an immigrant, a chemist who created a company that sold a particular type of product that 1s needed in the early phases of water treatment. I don\u2019t want to get too technical about what that work is. But in any event, it got me into the field of chemistry which is not too distant from my mother\u2019s wish to be a pharmacist. I really wasn\u2019t keen about being a pharmacist so I landed a job selling chemicals. I thought that was probably closer to what I wanted to do. And that was my first real full time quasi professional job. I still of course had not finished college. I was just into my first or second year. But then I was sent from New York to Milwaukee and started a new phase of my life. Seven years in Milwaukee and it enabled me to get married and cause now I had an income. And so in 52 I married.

Well again, as things turn out I was accepted at three very fine schools \u2014 Columbia, Princeton and MIT. But Harvard rejected me. So I eventually chose Cornell.

And that took place in Austria, Vienna. And so in 1989 I was on my way to Vienna."

But the issues remain very much the same. The difficulty is how open the lines are. You know we can make inspections in Australia and Canada very easily because they have nothing to hide. And but to make inspections in countries like Israel, to make them in Pakistan or those countries so --. As you saw in Iraq we missed a call. The president said there\u2019s nuclear material. We never found any nuclear material in Iraq so these things get to be quite difficult."

I really had no reason to come back to Europe. I knew of Austria\u2019s complicity in the war, even though they say they were a victim. And so at first I was going to reject coming here. But I thought it might open up a new chapter of my life and I might actually learn something about the past by coming here. And so I did come here. After I\u2019d been here about a year, year and a half, I was actually invited to Berlin by the mayor of Berlin, whose name I\u2019ve forgotten for the moment. And I met with the mayor of Berlin. He gave me more than an hour of his time. And we talked about that period that I remembered Kristallnacht and things of that sort.

And I had the sense that he wasn\u2019t that there were no alibis and that there was no way. And it wasn\u2019t a conversation where he expressed particular pity either, which I don\u2019t need. It was simply a rather straightforward very professional discussion of the period of history which was, which the damage done. Lives he mentioned that people in his own family \u2014 they\u2019re not Jews but people in his own family lost lives and in the course of war. And it changed my attitude toward the situation. But you know there is this question about for how many generations we should hold our \u2014 past generations we should hold our people \u2014 or future generations should hold accountable for the things that happened in the past. I don\u2019t know if you know in the Jewish tradition we try the same. But I\u2019m inclined to think now that I don\u2019t know whether Germany has come fully to terms. I don\u2019t know what fully to terms means. I think they\u2019re more the terms, have come more to terms with the events of that period than the Austrians have. The Austrians still haggle over what paintings to return to Jews and whether prove, Jews can prove enough so that they will return a painting that they are particularly fond of. I don\u2019t know if you follow that kind of news. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wolfgang Price 37 May 2, 2014 And, but I do find that when I disclose to the Austrians that I am Jewish, because I am on the circuit, I make lectures on, people ask about me. I don\u2019t particularly have to hide, I don\u2019t hide what I am. And often I will actually disclose it when I think it\u2019s appropriate to do so. And when I do, do so most of the people are interested in a rather sincere way about what my experiences were. Almost like the way you were. And they ask questions. What do I remember? What were my feelings and I\u2019m a bit of what you would call an anachronism or maybe that\u2019s not the right word that there aren\u2019t too many people who can talk first-hand about Kristallnacht. And when I, for instance I will meet on May 13\", in I guess a few days with the director, president of the National Bank of Austria, Claude Reidel. And, Klaus Reidel. And whenever I meet with him and he\u2019s very interested in what my recollections are and what my feelings were about the events that took place. So I sort of I\u2019m not as, I don\u2019t think I ever was bitter, but I am certainly, I certainly don\u2019t have a chip on my shoulder about those events of the past."

I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m kind of -- so the black civil rights movement for me meant that I supported it by wherever I could by -- for instance in our temple, that we had in https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wolfgang Price 39 May 2, 2014 Washington, DC. I forgot the name of the temple. We had, we were, it was a period when there was a lot of bad feeling between blacks and Jews. I don\u2019t know if \u2014 this was during the 70s when there were people in the black community who were somewhat vehement about their attitudes towards Jews. And to deal with that, the rabbi at the temple, sought to establish connections with the black community. And I was involved in some of those activities to try to see if we can minimize the certain feelings. But as you know there is a segment of the black community that has been hostile and now you hear less of but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gone away. What is your impression?"

If we start the process of saying that only the very, very top man is ultimately responsible. I mean and I think we relieve an awful lot of people who have a hand in this. I think we all have a responsibility at each level. The degree might change and but I, at the Nuremburg trial I think it was pretty clear that people can\u2019t plead that they were just carrying out orders. In Mr. Eichmann\u2019s case, the notion that he was detached and perhaps he didn\u2019t know or every train that left. And those things to me were irrelevant. Not irrelevant but I guess my feeling was he was party to it. They enjoyed the good times and if it worked out their way they\u2019d still be enjoying the good times.
