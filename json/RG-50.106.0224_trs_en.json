And he was awarded a, as many were, an Iron Cross. And eventually for his service in the German cause, was given permission to become a German citizen. Actually became a citizen of Berlin. That\u2122s what the papers say. And so in about 1919 or 1920, I don\u2122t have the papers in front of me, he relocated and settled in Spandau in Berlin. When he was in Berlin , he undertook slowly a number of enterprising activities. By 1930 when I was born, he had already several haberdashery stores, several meaning two or three. He owned some property including an interest in a movie or cinema. And on my mother\u2122s side, Margaret, her family was in the egg business, wholesale egg distribution business. And I once recalled how they met. I can\u2122t remember for the moment now. But somehow they met and married in 1927 I think it was, 26 or 27."

I don\u2122t know if you know what that is, but there was a famous chain of \u0152 and we went to Davega and at Davega they had a hundred baseball mitts all lined up on shelves. And of course, I was 14 and they all looked good. And I picked the biggest, nicest looking mitt and figured he would buy that and so I bought it or he bought it. And I was, of cour se, eager to use it on the field. And was somewhat disappointed when I realized that it didn\u2122t much help me. I had picked a catcher\u2122s mitt. So I picked a catcher\u2122s mitt, not because I wanted to be a catcher. I really didn\u2122t think. I wanted just the nicest looking mitt and this was the biggest nicest looking mitt on the shelf. Nobody told me that every position had its own mitt. And so for years I had that catcher\u2122s mitt which I could never really use. All right, my mother, when I went into the Korean War, my mother eventually got rid of that catcher\u2122s mitt."

It was the uranium boom period . I don\u2122t know if you remember that. And everybody was looking for this new material. And he had gone west to Utah where they were \u0152 and to New Mexico where there were sources of this material and he worked as an explorer and bought some Geiger counters and that started his career as a business man.

I\u2122m writing about, the book is writing about the western economies. That includes Europe and US and Russia. And the future for employment or what we call jobs. And despite the recent news today that the unemployment again has declined, I am saying that\u2122s all very, very temporary. In the long run the economy will change and so \u0152 do you read blogs. Do you know what I mean by a blog?"

But the issues remain very much the same. The difficulty is how open the lines are. You know we can make inspections in Australia and Canada very easily because they have nothing to hide. And but to make inspections in countries like Israel, to make them in Pakistan or those countries so --. As you saw in Iraq we missed a call. The president said there\u2122s nuclear material . We never found any nuclear material in Iraq so these things get to be quite difficult."

I really had no reason to come back to Europe. I knew of Austria\u2122s complicity in the war, even though they say they were a victim. And so at first I was going to reject coming here. But I thought it might open up a new chapter of my life and I might actually learn something about the past by coming here. And so I did come here. After I\u2122d been here about a year, year and a half, I was actual ly invited to Berlin by the mayor of Berlin, whose name I\u2122ve forgotten for the moment. And I met with the mayor of Berlin. He gave me more than an hour of his time. And we talked about that period that I remembered Kristallnacht and things of that sort.

And I had the sense that he wasn\u2122t that there were no alibis and that there was no way. And it wasn\u2122t a conversation where he expressed particular pity either, which I don\u2122t need. It was simply a rather straightforward very professiona l discussion of the period of history which was, which the damage done. Li ves he mentioned that people in his own family \u0152 they\u2122re not Jews but people in his own family lost lives and in the course of war. And it changed my attitude toward the situation. But you know there is this question about for how many generations we should hold our \u0152 past generations we should hold our people \u0152 or future generations should hold accountable for the things that happened in the past. I don\u2122t know if you know in the Je wish tradition we try the same. But I\u2122m inclined to think now that I don\u2122t know whether Germany has come fully to terms. I don\u2122t know what fully to terms means. I think they\u2122re more the terms, have come more to terms with the events of that period than the Austrians have. The Austrians still haggle over what pain tings to return to Jews and whether prove, Jews can prove enough so that they will return a painting that they are particularly fond of. I don\u2122t know if you follow that kind of news. Interview with Wolfgang Price 37 May 2, 2014 And, but I do find that when I disclose to the Austrians that I am Jewish, because I am on the circuit, I make lectur es on, people ask about me. I don\u2122t particularly have to hide, I don\u2122t hide what I am. And often I will actually disclose it when I think it\u2122s appropriate to do so. And when I do, do so most of the people are interested in a rather sincere way about what my experien ces were. Almost like the way you were. And they ask questions. What do I remember? Wh at were my feelings and I\u2122m a bit of what you would call an anachronism or maybe that\u2122s not the right word that there aren\u2122t too many p eople who can talk first -hand about Kristallnacht. And when I, for instance I will meet on May 13 th, in I guess a few days with the director, president of the National Bank of Austria, Claude Reidel . And, Klaus Reidel. And whenever I meet with him and he\u2122s very interested in what my reco llections are and what my feelings were about the events that took place. So I sort of I\u2122m not as, I don\u2122t think I ever was bitter, but I am certainly, I certainly don\u2122t have a chip on my shoulder about those events of the past."

I\u2122m kind of -- so the black civil rights mo vement for me meant that I supported it by wherever I could by -- for instance in our temple, that we had in Interview with Wolfgang Price 39 May 2, 2014 Washington, DC. I forgot the name of the temple. We had, we were, it was a period when there was a lot of bad feeling between blacks and Jews. I don\u2122t know if \u0152 this was during the 70s when there were people in the black community who were somewhat vehement about their attitudes towards Jews. And to deal with that, the rabbi at the temple, sought to establish connections with the black community. And I was involved in some of those activities to try to see if we can minimize the cert ain feelings.

If we start the process of saying that only the very, very top man is ultimately responsible. I mean and I think we relieve an awful lot of people who have a hand in this. I think we all have a responsibility at each level. The degree might change and but I, at the Nuremburg trial I think it was pretty clear that people can\u2122t plead that they were just carrying out orders. In Mr. Eichmann\u2122s case, the notion that he was detached and perhaps he didn\u2122t know or every train that left. And those things to me w ere irrelevant. Not irrelevant but I guess my feeling was he was party to it. They enjoyed the good times and if it worked out their way they\u2122d still be enjoying the good times.
