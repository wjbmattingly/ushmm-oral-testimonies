            "question": "United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection, this is an interview with Norman Salsitz, c onducted by Regina Baier, on July fifth, 1999, in Mr. Salsitz\u2122s home. This is a follow up interview to a USHMM videotaped interview conducted by -- with Norman Salsitz on May 12th, 1990. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. So -- any my first question would be when were you born, and where?",
            "answer": "I was born May the sixth, 1920, in a small town in Pola nd, southern Poland, named Kolbushova. And this -- people think that this -- well, this was known as Galeetsia, because before 1918, this belonged to Austria, and now as a section of Poland was called Galeetsia, so there where I was born. Then it became Poland, and it -- the section was called minor Poland. So, it was a very small town. It -- the town had 4,000 people, and from the 4,000 people, 2,000 were Jews, and 2,000 were Poles -- Catholics. We only had Catholics in our section. Protestants, we didn\u2122t have any Protestants there, so all Jews, or Catholics."

            "question": "And Norman, you have diffe rent names. One name you were born with, a name -- certain -- several names that you used during the war, and a name now. Could you give us first, all of these names? USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 3",
            "answer": "Yes. I can give you the names, because so metimes when I -- on th e street, or when I am in New York, and there are people who call me when they see me, and they call me different names, and I know from th -- wh ere they know me. Well now -- will tell you the -- the names. So for -- I was born as Naftali Salishitz. Salishitz was like -- is pronounced as a ger -- German name, because we were in Austria, with a u -- umlaut, and this how I was born. In the war, I became the first one that it was changed. It was Tadosh Yadduch. Tadosh Yadduch is when I jo ined the Polish underground, the AK, which is the home army, and in Polish it\u2122s armia kryova. They di dn\u2122t accept Jews, so I had to get some papers, and I masqueraded as a Polish Catholic, and with my papers, my birth certificate, which we will talk about it later, was Tadosh Yadduch, so my name was -- this was the name, and also, my friends called me Taddek. This is from Tadosh, is Taddek. So for this, if I hear somebody calls me Taddek, so I know they know me from this town. Then my name was, when I was there, so my name was -- became, in one part, it became Lazerosh Spillman. I had to do a certain job, and I had to be a German, so I had a friend, his name was Lazerosh Spillman, I took his name, and -- and this was for a short time, because Spillman is German, Lazerosh [indec ipherable]. Then I wer -- I -- my name became Anatoli Sherberkof. Anatoli Sherberkof is when I joined the r -- Russian group, and there were Russians, and again I had to mas querade as a -- as a -- as a Russian, so my name was Anatoli Sherberkof. Th en when I -- after the war, after I was liberated, I joined the Polish army. I volunteered for the Polish army, and my name became Tadosh Szaleski, because Tadosh, I liked the name, and Szaleski is because it\u2122s a very -- it\u2122s a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 4 nice, Polish name, with the s-k-i in the end. And this -- I used this name during my time in the Polish army, which I had a very, very im portant position, until I escaped. Also -- so now, when I see a person calls me Taddek, and so I know from where. And calls me Naftali, so I know he knows me from hom e. And then, my name was -- I was called Lotchik. Lotchik in Russian means a pilot, because when I joined the army, I was accepted to the air force, and everybody envied me, because very few people were accepted to the air force. So in po -- Russian is called Lotchik, so people called me Lotchik. Now even today, when I see some fr iends from this time, they say, \ufb01Oh, Lotchik is calling.\ufb02 Yeah. And then when I came to America -- so I changed my name from Naftali, because I came to America on my real name Naftali Salishitz. So I changed my name to Norman Salsitz, because my family thought that this is a -- all my family changed their names, and I picked out Salsitz , and nor -- and there is a whole story about -- about how I would change, but this is not for now. I have the story in my ne -- coming book how my name was changed. So I remained with na -- with Norman Salsitz, and this how I am today."

            "answer": "Well, Naftali -- I was the youngest in my family, which means all my sis -- I had five sisters. My fif -- sisters were older, and I was very, very spoiled, because all of them, as a matter of fact, til I was three, four years, one sister, which I liked very much -- I liked all of them -- I called her mama til I was four years old. They actually raised me, because my mother had nine children, so it was very hard for her. We lived in one room in this time, and there was -- I was born after the war. So I was very spoiled. And then later, nothing was impossible for me, because the family allowed me for a lot of things. And later, when I was older, I was not an angel. I did certain things that my father didn\u2122t like. Naturally, I didn\u2122t do bad things, but I was -- I was a re -- always I was a rebel. And I always, if I -- I always reached higher, that my -- my kind of people, or my family expected, especial later, when I started to go out with the girl of my dreams, [indecipherable]. I always wanted something higher, and I -- in school, I was a very -- I was, in my class in the public school, I was always the best student. And I have all my report cards. I have the report cards from the first grade to the last grade, I saved them, together with my photos. And I ver -- it was very unusual for a Jewish boy, who had sidelocks, and was reli -- and was dressed as a -- as a Hassidic boy, to have good report cards, because the teachers all were Poles -- Catholics, there was not a Jewish teacher, and they all hated Jews. Because I would say -- oh, maybe it\u2122s not the right expression, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 6 but I would say 95 percent they hated Jews, and especial they hated a Jew who was a religious Jew. We were different. So -- to -- for a Jew like this, to get a report card with -- from top to bottom excellent, it was very unusua l, but I have the report cards. Now, I went also to a Jewish school, we called it Yeshiva -- Chadda -- or Yeshiva, where we learn Jewish subjects. Now, I was not so good there, and my father always -- always ask questions. \ufb01How comes in the Polish school you are the best, and here you are not such a good student?\ufb02 Well, I didn\u2122t have so much inte rest in it. I had interest in geography, in history. Even today, so many years later, if you will ask me -- there was the river Vistula in Poland, which was the main river. And the main river had so many small rivers running into the main river, to make it a bigger river. And it started in the Carpathian mountains, and it ended in the Baltic Sea, in Danzig. So I can today mention all the rivers who fell in from the Carpathian mountains to the Vistula, the left and the right side. I remember it, because I was very interested in it. Poland had 40 kings, and if you will ask me, I will mention all the 40 kings, when they became kings, when they died. I remember those things, because I had an interest in this. And --"

It means me -- his name was Meershko, and he was th e originator of the Polish kingdom, before USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 7 Poland didn\u2122t have a kingdom, didn\u2122t have a country, ther e were tribes. And Meershko Peervsha was the first king, and he was also important, because in 966, he accepted Christianity for the Polish people. So 966 was very impor tant. And the last one was Zigmund August Porniatofsky. He was the last king, the 40 th king. So, h-he -- the -- Zigmund August Porniatofsky, there are rumors about him, that he was a lover of the Russian, and -- the czarina, and then -- and Poland didn\u2122t like it so much. Well, so those things were very important for me. Like, for instance, the mountains in Poland, the rivers in Poland, I remember it, because I loved it. So for this reason, I was a very good student."

        {
            "num": 9,
            "question": "Wh-Why did you love it so much ? What was so important to you?",
            "answer": "I loved it for -- for a few reasons. The first thing it was to me -- when I lived in Poland, I considered myself a Pole, a patriot. I say, we live in this country -- Jews lived in Poland for a thousand years. My town exis ted since 1773. So it means oma -- over two hun -- 200 years. So I always said, if I live in a country, I -- this is my country. Naturally, in this time -- and so I loved it, and I love d everything, and also literature. If you will ask me about Polish writers, and Polish literature -- literature, I remember important poems. And -- and I -- I liked it. Where the Jewish learning, I did it because my father wanted me to do it. I was proud to be a Jew, but I wanted to show, because I lived in Poland, and because the peep -- Polish people didn\u2122t like us, so I wanted to show that I am a good Pole. And so was my father. My father was, I would say, the bigges t Polish patriot in our town. He was a Jew with the long beard, and -- and very relig ious, very learned, but he was one of the few who spoke Polish beautiful . He spoke Polish without a Jewish accent, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 8 correct grammar, ever -- he spoke -- now, as a matter of fact, if sometimes they had to send a delegation to the Polish peep -- to the go vernment or something, my father went as a spokesman, because on account of his language. And when there were some national holidays or something, my sp -- father spoke about -- spoke, because it was unusual to see a Jew with a long, gray beard speak Polish. Now, there was a reason why he spoke good Polish, and if later -- if you will have time, I will tell you the reasons. So I li -- now, for instance, there was a peasant movement in Poland, which 90 -- I would say 75 percent of the population were peasants. And they were not very well off before the war. They -- the government didn\u2122t treat them very right, because where -- because the government was run by the nobility, and by people who were educated, and the peasants didn\u2122t have a chance. Now, my father was the only Jew in our town that he belonged to this movement. And when the peasants used to make gatherings in our town, which the government was against it, and the thousands of thousands of peasants came to the marketplace to speak about the unjustice, what the government is doing against the Poles, against the peasants, all the meetings, everything was done in our house. Now, he did it because he believed in it, and also he did business with the peasants. Our business -- he had the wholesale grocery store, and the wholesale -- the grocery store was not a grocery, it was like in America you have a general store; we sold ever ything. We sold in a -- grease for wagons, and we sold kerosene, and we sold flour -- wi -- everything was in our store. So the small stores in the villages came to buy by us, because we were the wholesaler. And so this way he had the contact with the people. Also , he had the contact because he was born in USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 9 that village. He was born in that village in 1882, in a village called Dubass, which is about five kilometer from Kolbushova. His father was the manager of the village. Now, I want you should know that a village isna -- wasn\u2122t like it\u2122s now, which is everybody land -- owned land. A village belonged to one person. In old -- it was a serfdom, it was a -- so then the -- all the people worked for this person, and my grandfather was the manager. When to cut, when to gather, when to sell, he was the manager. And in Poland he had -- in Polish he had a special name, they called him Veeairnick. Veeairnick in Poland means a man -- a trust -- a trustee. It means that you believed him. So the man who owned the village trusted him, and he was managing, and naturally the profit went to the owner. So maybe this is the reason my father had a little connection to the land, to the people, and naturally, they didn\u2122t reciprocate, they didn\u2122t pay him back th at they loved him, because - maybe they liked him, but they di dn\u2122t love him because he was a Jew."

I went through three camps, from which I escaped, and I went in to the underground, to the woods. We had a Jewish group. In our Jewish group, we had 120 -- this is a long story -- we -- I describe it in my books. We had 125 members in our group, Jews. We started to get arms, guns, and then later, I was shot by my -- one of my best friends, he shot me four times, three bullets entered my neck. And this was a man who was the head of this Polish underground , AK, armia kryova, the home army. And he was a friend, we went to school together. But nevertheless, I was a Jew, and the armia kryova, the home army didn\u2122t accept Jews, and when I came to him that he should incorporate my group -- because later I became the commandant of my Jewish group. Now, we had -- the highest number of our gr oup was 125, but in this time we had about 69, because we started to be killed, killed, killed. Not by Germans, we were mostly killed by Poles. So when I saw that we are being killed, and I find out that he is the leader, so I, through messengers I sent him, I want to have a meeting w ith him, and when I had the meeting, I offered that we have al-almost 70 people, young people, and we want to join his group, and I even told him that he can use us to the most dangerous -- [clock chiming]"

            "question": "In the way you felt about things. Revenge seems to have become an important theme at this point. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 12",
            "answer": "Yes, yes. Revenge was very important for me, and the revenge was important for a few reasons, but the main reason was, when my father was shot in the ghetto, the 28th of April, 1942, I witnessed it. And when he was shot by the Gesta po, before he died, he said what a Jew usually says before he dies, God is [indecipherable], we call it the shema Israel. And then he said -- the last words were, \ufb01Nakuma, nakuma, nem nakuma.\ufb02 It means, revenge, revenge, take revenge. Now, he said it in such a voice, that it was not a natural voice, it was something that it came from heaven, an unnatural voice, which I -- til today, it is already almost 70 years, I can still hear his voice yelling to take revenge. And this gave me strength to survive. I said , \ufb01I must survive to take revenge.\ufb02 For this reason, revenge was so important for me. Some people say so what is revenge? Revenge is nothing. Not for me, ben when you started to think, everyone who has a family, and if he would started to think that all his family were killed by certain people, and they were not only killed, before they were killed, they were tortured. Hunger, beating, starvation, and then finally killed, and you will say, \ufb01We ll, if I can get these men, I am going to kill them.\ufb02 Sure now, in 1999, you don\u2122t think about it, because we are normal people, la -- we live in America. But in this time, the only dream I had is to take revenge. And for this reason, revenge was so important. Only -- also, this was my father\u2122s -- the legacy what I got from my father. Also, revenge was important, I had five sisters. My five sisters were married. They had little children. I was very close to the children, we lived together. And when I started to think, there\u2122s a little girl, her name was Blimcha, she was three and a half years. She was like an angel, with gold curled hairs. And if I start to think that this USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 13 girl had to be killed, and the others, I had 21 people. Why were they killed? For no -- not because they were bad, they were killed just because they were Jews. And if I survived, and if I wouldn\u2122t take -- I was the only survivor, and maybe if they are in heaven, I don\u2122t know, they would s -- or -- or before they were killed, they knew, because I always was the one who went down from the ghetto, brou ght food, and brought them candy. And if they would be killed, they would say, \ufb01Well, Naftali will take care on it.\ufb02 And they probably thought about it, that I would take care on it. If they are in heaven, which I don\u2122t know if they are, this is a different story, if they are, and if they look down, and they said -- and they looked at me and said , I was the survivor, the survivor to take revenge, and if wouldn\u2122t take revenge, I will be a traitor, I would be a disappointment for them, because I was the only one. So I had to take revenge. Now, after the war, after I came to America, I still take revenge. But I cannot go out, take bodily revenge, physical revenge. So my revenge is that I survived the war to tell the story, to tell the cruelties, to tell the murdering things. This is my revenge, and maybe this is the reason I survived. Otherwise, why did I survive, why not the ot her people? But this is the reason that I survived. In the war it was a physical reveng e. Now the revenge is, like I\u2122m speaking to you, I give other testimonies, I go to school s. I go -- people ask me -- if somebody asked me to speak about the Holocaust, I am always ready. I never took a penny, people want to pay me, I said, \ufb01No, this is not a thing that I want to get paid.\ufb02 Y -- I have to do it, so long as I am alive, because in a few years there will not be survivors. And who knows? If now USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 14 we have deniers, where we are still alive, what will be a few years later? So my duty is to tell and retell the cruelties. To tell the stories, because I was a witness. I was there."

The first legacy was that my father said revenge, revenge, reven -- this I said, I must live to take revenge, because if -- if my father is in heaven, as we believe, how would I be able to face him, he ask me, \ufb01Did you do something, did you take re venge because they shot me?\ufb02 I did. Maybe I didn\u2122t take enough revenge, looking back, I didn\u2122t take enough, but I did. The second legacy was when my mother was taken from the town of Jheshuf, from the ghetto, cause we were taken from Kolbushova, from a small town to a larger town, to Jheshuf, where they gathered more Jews, to be able to send them to a death camp. And when she was taken to Belzyce, to the death camp, with all her five sis -- daughters, with the son-in-laws, with her grandchildren, somehow she gave someb ody a letter. She could give a letter, and I was on this time in a camp, and they brough t the letter to me. And I remember -- I don\u2122t have the letter, I would give everything to have the letter, but I don\u2122t have it. But I remember the words. And she wrote to me, \ufb01You are the youngest of my nine children, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 15 and you know always the youngest is the smartest,\ufb02 in their eyes. \ufb01You are young, you are strong, you are smart. You go and surv ive the war, because after the war, you go to America, and tell to El,\ufb02 I had a brother alr eady in America. \ufb01Tell to El,\ufb02 his name was El, \ufb01what the murderers did to us. Go to Palestine.\ufb02 I had a brother in Palestine, David. \ufb01Go to David, and tell him what the murderer s did to us. Go to the world, and tell the world what the murderers did to us.\ufb02 She se -- she also wrote, \ufb01Let your being an orphan not break you. Go out, fight, be strong, and survive.\ufb02 This gave me a o-other s -- reason to survive, and for this reason, from the first minute when I was liberated, when people didn\u2122t want to tell stories about the Holocaus t, from the first minute, I spoke. People, in the beginning, didn\u2122t like it. They looked at me and they saw this is an obsession, that I speak about the Holocaust, but I spoke. Peopl e who survived, they didn\u2122t want to speak. It took a long time til they started to speak in the 60\u2122s and the 70\u2122s. I spoke about the Holocaust in \u212245, and \u212246, but people didn\u2122t want to listen. When I came to America, when I told the people, they thought I\u2122m crazy. They didn\u2122t want to listen. This was the legacy from my mother. So those two legacies were the most important thing. It wasn\u2122t important that if I am alive, and not alive. So other men will s -- survive. I never -- I never thought that being alive was such an important thing as a personal thing, that I am alive. But a pers -- the important thing were those two legacies that I could fulfill."

One was Lyba, and one was Herschel. And the Lyba actually, if not Lyba, we wouldn\u2122t survive, because he was a village Jew, and his profession was he was a trapper before the war, and he knew the woods. And I described what things -- he liv ed l-like a woodsman, and to me he -- his -- his -- he was like a -- a deer. He was -- he was like -- like a animal. Not an animal in a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 17 bad sense, but he knew all t hose things, h-he could [indec ipherable]. So, on account of him, we could survive. And his older brother was with him, so there were Lyba and his brother, I and my bro -- and there were tw o from my town. One was Lyebish Nestel, one was Connor. And the -- and the two were cousin s, and they survived with us all the war. So happens that they were -- the -- the other one was Naftali Connor. And they were religious Jews. During all the time when we were -- they were with me in the ghetto, they were with me in the camp, they were with me in the woods. And dur ing all the time, they didn\u2122t eat anything that it was not kosher -- it means it was not for Jews . So they only ate a piece of bread, some fruit, vegetables if they had. If we had meat, they wouldn\u2122t eat it. If we killed a deer, or we killed a rabbit, they wouldn\u2122t eat it. But anyway, they survived. And after, when they -- the -- when -- when we were liberated in -- in the end of July, so they said, \ufb01We -- we are liberated. No more Germans. We are going home.\ufb02 And they thought they would come home, they will be looked on like on heroes. They survived from the whole war -- Jewish community.

            "question": "How -- how did you hear about that?",
            "answer": "Well, I heard it right away, because when they went -- came to our town, they -- I told them not to go, because I knew that nothing good -- because they killed so many during the war, and when they went there -- then later, the Polish people between themselves, everybody knew about it, because this was not done in secret. They took them openly, and they took them to the river by the ce metery, and they shot them. And -- and the people who were in my -- in our town, they told me this [indecipherable] not only one, a few of them. There were some people who were very sympathetic, and they told me. Now, the reason, later -- and I wrote this in my book, and naturally the people are very angry in -- in my town why I wrote it about it, and they said to me, \ufb01You shouldn\u2122t have write it, because in case this book will be -- will be translated into Polish, this Kishel has,\ufb02 -- he\u2122s now 85 years, he lives in the town, he had grandchildren. So the grandchildren will find out that their grandfather was a murderer. So I shouldn\u2122t -- I should retract it, I should write a article that is not true. They said he killed doesn\u2122t mean anything, but the children shouldn\u2122t know that he was a murd erer. This what they wrote to me when the book came out. Now, I found out -- the reason why, which I understand, the reason why -- why in this Kishel, who was the director of the internal revenue, he USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 19 volunteered he should kill them, because there were the group of the ar -- of the AK members, and when they caught the two Jews, he volunteered to kill them. Now, why should he volunteer to kill them? The -- the -- the -- the reason was that this one of them, Lyebish Nestel, he was such a nice person, a scholar. You see, both of them were rabbinical students, they were very intelligent people. So before the war, when the war blew out, he was in the active Polish army, and his unit, his regiment was sent over to the German border, because they had to protect Poland. And he was, and he was a very good soldier. Now, also Kishel, the director of the internal revenue was in the reserve, he was an officer. And he was also in the same unit. And when the Germans attacked Poland, naturally the units started to pull back. And they came to a small town in -- near the German border, near Katovitz. And this was -- mostly there were Jews, so the Kishel knew this Lyebish Nestel, so he said to him, \ufb01Well, why don\u2122t you go to the Jews, where you are a Jew, and get two Hassidic coats [indecipherable], and we will change our uniform, and we will go home.\ufb02 To change as being Jews. This what he told to Lyebish Nestel. So Lyebish Nestel said to him -- and this was his officer -- and a Polish guy, a patriot. So Lyebish Nestel told him, \ufb01I will not do it. I am in the army. I came here to protect my country, to fight for my country. I wouldn\u2122t do it.\ufb02 Kishel looked at him, and that\u2122s -- this was it. Two days later, Kish el disappeared. He didn\u2122t know what a -- probably he did it on his own, he run away. Lyebish Nestel was fighting, fighting, til they came near Lublin. This was deep into the Polish countryside, and he was taken as a prisoner by the Germans, as a soldier. Somehow, usually if Je ws were taken as prisoners, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 20 they didn\u2122t survive, because the Germans killed them. Somehow he run away. He run away, he came to our town, and he told everybody the story. He told the story how is it possible that Kishel -- and Kishel disappear ed, nobody knew where he is -- where he was. Naturally, Lyebish was with me in the ghetto, he was with me in the camp, he was with me two years in the woods, and he got killed. Kishel disappeared. After the war, Kishel became very important because he was a leader in the AK, in the underground, and he was not any more inter -- internal revenue, he was older, he had got married. He -- he had children. He lives now in a town in Poland. And I wrote his stories. They are now angry why I told his story. I told his story because this is the truth. So those two were killed. So from the six, only four survived. Now, from the four, from the four, six months later, Lyba, who was our savior, who was the trapper, was poisoned in our -- in the village, there he was -- there he was poisoned, he di ed. His brother Herschel was older, he went to Palestine before it -- Israel, and he died in Israel. Lyebish, my brother, came to America, and he died in 1965, as a -- got th e heart attack, he died. So I am the only one alive from our group, and there were very, very seldom places that Jews organized. So happens we organized in the woods, nobody su rvives that. I have to tell those stories. Now, I know every one who got killed. I even wanted to write a book that everybody\u2122s dead. How it was, how he was killed, how he was betrayed -- mostly they were betrayed by Poles. Maybe I will do it yet. Why? Because I\u2122m the only one who wa -- I\u2122m alive. And if I would not be alive, nobody would know the stories. I tell to the families. If they USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 21 have somebody [indecipherable] how they we re with me in the woods, and how they died. So from the 125, I am only one alive."

            "question": "Let\u2122s go back then, and talk a little b it about your personal liberation. How did it happen, and what -- what did you do afterwards?",
            "answer": "Well, when my bi -- liberation is, that when it was -- this was after -- after I had to escape from the AK, because like I said to you, I was a me mber in the AK, and there were a few things, I don\u2122t know if you want me to tell you why I left the AK and came back to my brother. So the -- this -- this was -- okay, so -- so I came back, an -- I was about a week or two weeks, but we already saw that it is the end. Why? Because we saw Ericthsook. We saw that the Germans soldiers are coming, and they -- the army, and ththey occupied the villages with their equipment. Every day more and more and more German soldiers. And we were in this time in hiding, because we didn\u2122t have a group any more. So we knew -- and then we started to hear cannons. In every -- the night, the cannons were louder and louder, so we knew th at this is the end, but how can we survive til the end, because in the last minute -- we su ffered for six years, in the last minute we will be killed. So my brother, with one of those Lybovitch went to a friendly Pole, that we used to go once in awhile to hide there, and they were with them, and I went with Lyba to look, to see, to different peasants. Because we didn\u2122t know exactly, we knew it\u2122s coming, but we didn\u2122t know exactly. So I went with Lyba to a peasant, his name was Yanhodor. I had described him, he was very good, he was very friendly, he and his children. So we went to his house, and then we went -- we s -- we heard a unit of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 22 Calvary, German Calvary is going t -- he was -- the road was right next to his house, near the woods. And the Calvary is going, you coul d hear the chains, and the horses. So we run in -- in the -- in the barn, or where they was -- the hay, and we buried ourselves under the hay, and then we -- so we heard that th e soldiers coming in, opened the door, and they taking out hay for their -- for the horses. So we were afraid that they would take away everything, we will be discovered. But we were not discover ed, and after the -- the calva -- the units went, so we came out. We s -- we di -- we wanted to ask how the war is going on, but he wasn\u2122t home, because when he saw that it is already so bad. So he, with his family, he took the few cows, and they were run into the forests to hide. So they were not home. So, when we went out -- so we said, \ufb01Well, we have to go to see what our brothers are doing,\ufb02 because my brother was with his brother, but the woman, her name was Mary pren -- Prenetta. So we went -- we went to go out to see. As we came out from the woods where we were, and there was a big clearing, and we had to go over to the other side, where my brother, with his brother were. As we came out on the clearing, people started to shoot at us from both sides. Here in this side for where we liv ed, were the Germans, and the other side of the clearings were already the Russians. And when they saw two people, they didn\u2122t know who we are. And both started to shoot millions of bullets. And this was at night, and I just see bullets like -- like slow bugs, red, light [indecipherable]. And so, we were afraid, so st -- luckily there was a small -- not a river, it was some water, we jumped in in the water. And the -- the -- the -- the shooting stopped, and there were haystacks, because this was in the time when they cut the hay, this was -- so we went in USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 23 in the haystacks to cover ourselves. The shooting stopped, and then we didn\u2122t know where, what, when. We knew that there is a shooting between us. So when -- suddenly there were two horses -- two riders on one horse, from a distan ce, and it was at night. So Lyba, my friend, says, \ufb01Oh, I know those peasants.\ufb02 And he even said to me their name is -- one name is Poslooshnid. And he remembers even the horse, because he sold them the horse before the war. Now, \ufb01Go,\ufb02 he said, \ufb01ask them. Because if I\u2122m going to ask them, they know I am a Jew, they could kill me. But you go, they don\u2122t know who you are.\ufb02 And I was dressed like a peasant, no shoes, with a jacket, and -- and I run up to them, and they were on a -- two on a horse, and I -- I couldn\u2122t see who they are. And I started to y -- to yell, Parnyi Poslooshnid, Poslooshnid. Th ey heard me, they stopped. And when I run to them, and I come to them, and I saw on the horse, there are two SS men on the horse. And they -- and naturally they were dr-dressed, with the helmet, but in the distance I saw a silhouette. So when they saw me, I s -- I didn\u2122t know what to do . To run away it was too late, ba -- so they jumped down from the horse, right away took out their guns, and they start asking who I am. Now, I didn\u2122t want to say that I speak German, because usually Jews spoke German, not peasants. And I started to tell them with a crying voice, you know, what will I do, my wife is in the woods, my children in the woods. They say the Russians are raping the women, and I start -- so I could see that one of them understands Polish. Probably he was from Salazzi or something, and I could hear that he\u2122s translating to the other soldier what I am saying. And when I saw that he\u2122s translating, so I started to cry more, and I said, \ufb01Help me, help me. We were with the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 24 Germans, nothing happened to us, an -- and now the Russians will come in a,\ufb02 -- well, so he said -- the [indecipherable] he listened to me. So then he said to his -- so the other man said to him in German, which I understood, he said, \ufb01Now, we don\u2122t have to go.\ufb02 Because they were a patrol to see wa -- from where the Russian. We don\u2122t have to go -- because they were afraid for themselves, too. Let\u2122s take him to our headquarters, and he will tell us everything what we have to know. And they said to me, the guy, in Polish, to go in front of them into -- they will take me. So -- and they went back on the horse, put back their revolvers in their holster, they had rifles, they were back in the [indecipherable] and I had to go in front. Now, I knew that if I would go there, I would be killed. Why? Because I had a jacket, and underneath the jacket I had a belt, and on the belt I had the revol -- I had the revolver, I ha d hand grenades, I had a hatchet, I had a bayonet, I have a flashlight. I have everythi ng I had on me. Now when -- they didn\u2122t see it, because it was the -- the jacket covered it. But I always had a revolver, and the revolver with the long barrel, remember, parabellum, I had. No, it wasn\u2122t a parabellum, it was a -- a revolver. [indecipherable], and I always had it not in my holster, but I have it -- had it in front of me in my belt, stuck in my belt. And as they went back on the horse, I figure -- I said, \ufb01This is my chance.\ufb02 I turned around, pulled out the revolver, and I emptied right away, all seven bullets to them, they fell down dead. And as I started to shoot, then you could see millions of bullets came from both sides. They didn\u2122t know who is shooting, they saw shooting. So, you could see it. But luckily, they didn\u2122t hit me. I w -- I bend down, I had an even -- I [indeci pherable] took away their revolvers, and -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 25 and -- and I took the horse, and I kept the horse from the side where the bullets are coming in case a bullet will hit, it will kill the horse, and I moved over to the side, not from where I came, but I moved over to the opposite side. And I went over because I figured why should I go here, here are the Germans, and there who know, maybe the Russians. I went over there, and as I came closer to the woods, and I saw a few came out, is a -- Russians, said to me to lift -- to raise my hand, and they looked at me, and they ask me who I am, so I said, \ufb01I am a Polish partisan.\ufb02 I spoke Russian. And they took away the revolvers, and they said, \ufb01We have to take you to our comman -- commander.\ufb02 And we went to the commander, and I told him the whole story, and he was very -- see, I didn\u2122t know if they would believe me, so I said, \ufb01I have a friend he re, I have to go, and we have more people. I have to tell them wh at\u2122s going on, that the Russians are here.\ufb02 And I still didn\u2122t know if they believed me. I remember even I asked them -- I ask them to give me a star, what they have on their hearts a star, to give me a star to show it to my friends that I met the Russians, because they [indecipherable]. They gave me back my revolver, and they -- and I said I will go back with them. And when I went away from this [indecipherable], I was sure that they would shoot me. I was sure they don\u2122t believe me. And in ma -- I remember when I walked, it\u2122s like I would walk on air, so that I knew that I -- any second a bullet will come in. But they didn\u2122t shoot me, and I went back to my friend, he was laying there in the haysta ck. When he saw me, he started to kiss me, because he heard the shots, and he thought th at I was shot. He didn\u2122t know that I shot them. And -- so we already knew that on this side are the Russians, on this side are USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 26 Germans, so he took me -- he had the old friend, a woman -- a old woman, and he said, \ufb01Let\u2122s go to her.\ufb02 And we went over to her, and we went up on the attic, nobody saw us. And in -- before -- before, in the morning, he -- we hear the door opens, and a Russian soldier comes in with a -- with a pat. And he comes in, and -- and -- when we saw -- I saw a Russian soldier, I jumped down. He said, \ufb01I came here, there\u2122s a cow I want to milk for some -- I want to milk the cow.\ufb02 And I grabbed him, and I dance with him. I said [indecipherable]. He said, \ufb01Yes, during the night, my unit came into this village, and we occupy this village, my unit is here.\ufb02 And he -- -- an-and we have the -- so this was the moment that I knew that I am liberated, the Russians are there. Now, I went right away with him. I said, \ufb01And you take me to yo ur commander.\ufb02 And I told him I\u2122m from a Jewish group. Him, I was not afraid any more to say [indecipherable] I didn\u2122t say I was a Jew. But Lyba, he didn\u2122t go with me. He still was afraid, he was very, very careful. He said, \ufb01I will not go with you,\ufb02 and he was still on the attic hiding. He was hiding I don\u2122t know how long, and I went out, then later I called him, and then we went to see -- this was already the territory liberated, and I went to see my brother. And I came, and I saw my brother sitting with his brother, but they were not any more on the attic hiding. They were sitting in the kitchen with their [indecipherable], and there in the kitchen were also about four or five girls, uniforms, Russian officers, because they had a field hospital there, and with the fee -- and they were doctors in the field hospital, and we started to talk in between the -- the four or five girls, two of them were Jewish. And we told them that we were li -- we were in this, and we -- we were and this was how we were liberated. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 27 But, I didn\u2122t go back to my town, because I knew that if I will go back to my town, I would be killed, because they knew that I killed those two Augustin brothers. That I killed them in my self defense, this didn\u2122t mean anything. So, I didn\u2122t go back to my town. The other two went, and they were killed, and we went on, my brother and I, we went to Jheshuf, to a larger town, where Jews who were liberated, came from different villages, from different towns, and they came with a guard up there. Now, Lyba and Herschel, the two, they didn\u2122t go with us, because they were village Jews. So they still remained in the village to be there living with the peasants.

And -- but ma -- with me, I always wanted to fight, to be involved in the war, so I -- I went, and I volunteered. I volunteered t -- it was very unusual for a Jewi sh survivor to voluntee r, because Poland in this time, nem -- organized -- the army was organized Russia, but Poland [indecipherable]. They took in my years -- where they -- they were born in 1920, to the army, but they didn\u2122t take Jews. Not because they didn\u2122t wa nt to take Jews, but they didn\u2122t have no evidence about the Jews, they didn\u2122t know who survived, and very few survived. So actually, they didn\u2122t mobilize, they didn\u2122t draft the Jewish boys. But I wanted, definitely to be part of it. So -- and also, it happened once, it a -- it was a -- a -- a episode that I went in to a barber. I have this story in the book. I went into a barber, and I -- I suspected everybody was a killer. Like naturally, if I would be the ge -- in Germany, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 32 when I was in Germany, I looked on everybody, and every body I thought, \ufb01Was he the killer of my mother, of my sisters?\ufb02 But in Poland, even, they were so against our groups, that they -- I suspected that the majority, they didn\u2122t like Jews. So when I went over once, to a barber, and there were -- there were people -- there were people sitting there and waiting in line for the barber, and I looked at them, and I looked at the faces, I didn\u2122t know them. So I looked at the faces, and I thought they all looked at me that they recognize I am a Jew. Maybe they recognize, maybe I was not dressed the same way as they. And -- and this was after I came out from -- from the woods. And -- and I -- I s -- I start to think maybe I made a bad mistakes, th at I came over here to this barber, and who knows what they will do to me?

But I thought so. An as -- as he -- he was finish with the -- with the cream on my face, and he took the razor blade, and he wanted to shave me, he started to sh ave my neck, I grabbed his hand, and -- and I stood up, and I run out.

Now later, I was -- when I was in this town, later I was ashamed to go to pass his store, because I was ashamed what I did, because I knew that this was not -- but they were sitting there, they couldn\u2122t understand why I had run away in the middle.

So I - my -- the special mission was, when we came closer th -- because we went with the Russian front, and we were attached, hundred of us were attached to the first lines of the Russian front, because the front started offensive like I said, January the 12th, and we were attached, and we were like -- like -- not like zion officers, but we were part of the -- the -- the front f-fighters, but we didn\u2122t do the fighting, but we went with them, they had to be straightened out with the local people, with the administration, yeah. So we went USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 38 with them, and I am describing this in details in the book, and then when we came before Krak\u00f3w, and Krak\u00f3w was a very, very important town, because the first thing it was the most historical Polish town, because the capi tal, it was the capital, and it was the -- the place of the kings. They lived in Krak\u00f3w, and also it was the barbel. Barbel is the castle where all the kings lived, and they\u2122re buried. So we find out about three days before -- we were before Krak\u00f3w, s -- and this was the front was going, we went with the front, and they -- did the Russian army went forwards, and the German went back. So, about three days before we came before Krak\u00f3w, and also Krak\u00f3w was not ok -- was not taken -- like usually in a war, you go from the -- and this time we went from the east to the west, like the army didn\u2122t go from east to the west. What they did, they wanted to surround, and to destroy the rush -- the German garmi zone in Krak\u00f3w. So what the Russian, was a very smart thing what they did, they went -- before Krak\u00f3w they went to the north, and then they surrounded, and they came into Krak\u00f3w from the west. Because, actually, they had to enter Krak\u00f3w from the east, but they came in thr -- from the west, and we went with them, and we went part of it, and in about th ree days before we were before Krak\u00f3w, we find out that Krak\u00f3w is mined, that they pu t in mines in Krak\u00f3w, with columns, with explosives, and the -- and in any minute, th e mi -- and -- and -- and their aim is to explode the town, and to destroy the whole to wn. We knew about it, because we had the fifth c-columns that they are doing it. Now -- so they wanted to -- yes, and as we came to the -- closer to Krak\u00f3w from the west, so the Russian engineers, if -- f-find out that they already found some installations with [ind ecipherable], where there were important USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 39 buildings, but they couldn\u2122t destroy the whole thing, because it\u2122s like -- like this was the end. So they could dismantle all -- detach th e electricity from the end of houses, but this was like -- like a snake. If you cut off a piece of tail of a snake, the whole snake is still alive. We had to know that central installation from where the whole town, the electricity is connected. So they picked out -- they picked out three officers to go to Krak\u00f3w and to find out. And this was before Krak\u00f3w was even liberated, and th-the Russians picked out. Now I -- th -- I had very good recommendations, because like I told you that this man wrote to the leaders that he knows me, said I am special in this, I did so much during the underground, you know. And then we pi cked out one -- a native Krak\u00f3wian, who survived the war in -- in th -- in the Russia, and later he joined the Polish army, and he came back with the Polish army, and so he -- wi -- and because he was a native Krak\u00f3wian, and so he was very important, and then we -- they invi -- they picked out the other men with us, so three of us, we got th e order to go in to see how we can find out where the people who -- who built those things are, maybe we can prevent from the destruction. And we came into Krak\u00f3w, this was winter, it was very cold. Remember, we came into Krak\u00f3w January the 17th. The Russians took over part, but the ar -- a big part was still in the German hands, because officially, the town was liberated January the 19 th, and we were there already the 17th, through channels, and je -- and also we had people in Krak\u00f3w who were a fifth column for us. So we contacted some, and we find out that it\u2122s true, that the Germans want to destroy, and they built, in Krak\u00f3w, they built columns on the main thoroughfares -- the main streets, they built columns s -- f -- a story high, with USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 40 four feet in diameter, filled with dynamite. Everything was connected, and everything had to be blown up with one push of a butt on. And -- and they had also mines, the main post office, and the railroad station, the [indecipherable] was -- was the king\u2122s castle. All the most important building, everything was mined. Were 287 mines all together in Krak\u00f3w, and this had to be de stroyed with one push of a button, and we knew that the -- if we will come closer th -- the -- this will happen. So, we were wor -- we worried very much. And we started to have leads where finally we find out -- and again, in the book I write a little more about it, you cannot have the whole book here. We find out that the -- that the company who made those columns, and those mines was done by an Austrian company, Meyerader and Krauss. And the Meyerader and Krauss isn\u2122t -- the headquarters was on the street Yuloushalaya , and we find out, and this wa s a winter night, a blizzard, cold, and we went -- we sent over the three to find out if -- if they -- they -- we can find out something. They came back they couldn\u2122t -- they didn\u2122t let in nobody, because every place where there was a German company, they -- and this was in the most exclusive place in Krak\u00f3w, where the German took over, and then the next [indecipherable] was the Gestapo, and -- and so he ba -- by -- those places there was a iron gate, and around the iron gate there was a concrete bunker, with openings, with machine guns, they always did it there, and we sent over those, and th-the y couldn\u2122t go in, the three guys, so we three went, said, well we will go ourselves. And before we went there, as I cross the street I find out that there is a -- a-apartments, that there was the Zunderdienst. Zunderdienst was auxiliary to the SS, which was from ethnic Germans. And we came in, the Zunderdienst USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 41 left, and there were about eight girls, and the girls were cooks, and not cooks, and partners to sleep and all those things, well -- so we came in, and we -- we had vodka, we cigarettes, and a -- w -- and we became very fri endly with them, and they told us about this building across the street from the Meyerade and Krauss. And they told us that the Germans left already, about two days ago, but they left over the secretary, and she\u2122s still there. So a -- I couldn\u2122t understand how comes they left and they left the secretary, a German girl. She said, \ufb01Yeah, she\u2122s there, because they saw her after the Germans left.\ufb02 And I asked them how do you know that she was German? Oh she, they know because she used to come after the curfew, and she used to be -- they brought her with the cars. So we did -- the two -- the three who we sent didn\u2122t -- couldn\u2122t go in, so we went there, and we knocked on the door, and no body let us in, and so we were ready -- this was already start to be dark, so we -- I wanted to -- to open th -- the door, to shut the door, then I saw that somebody\u2122s looking through the window, a young girl. So I said, \ufb01Let\u2122s wait.\ufb02 And the janitor came, he said, \ufb01Nobody\u2122s here, they all left.\ufb02 So I told him, \ufb01Well, I saw there a young girl in the window.\ufb02 So he saw that we know, so he said, \ufb01Wait, I\u2122ll bring the keys.\ufb02 He went up, he got the keys, and we came in. So in the apartment we came, it was the most beautiful apartment with oil paintings, carpets, beautiful. And there were -- and there were four women, one was the daughte r-in-law of the owner of the house, then were two peasant girls, they were the maids, and then I s -- I saw a beautiful girl, dressed very nice, she wa -- she was standing there. So I start to ask who they are, then they told us [indecipherable] and when I came to her, she said, \ufb01Well, my name is Felicia USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 42 Muirashefska.\ufb02 And I ask her whose apartment it is, she said, \ufb01Well, this is the apartment that we live, but it belong to Meyerader and Krauss,\ufb02 and I start to ask her more questions, she got annoyed, I got annoyed, and -- and she -- I said, \ufb01How could you have a job l -- wh-what -- do you work here?\ufb02 She said, \ufb01I work, but thank God I don\u2122t work any more, because the Germans left already.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Well, what do you mean the Germans left already? You are German, aren\u2122t you?\ufb02 She said, \ufb01No, I am Polish,\ufb02 and she showed me a kanekarta. So I said, \ufb01Yeah, we find out different, we find out that you were German.\ufb02 But we questioned and questi ons, and -- and I got very nasty, she got -- she didn\u2122t cooperate. She looked at this guy, the guy who wa s a Krak\u00f3wian, he had a very Semitic face, he looked like he was a Polish officer, but he looked like -- he didn\u2122t have a Slavic face. So she asks if -- if she can speak to him. So I said, \ufb01Okay.\ufb02 And then -- and then -- and she went with him to the other room, and she said to him, \ufb01What are you bothering me, I am the same as you.\ufb02 He sa id, \ufb01What do you mean, I am the same as you? I am a Polish officer, and you are a German.\ufb02 She said, \ufb01No, I\u2122m not a German, I\u2122m Polish, and -- and besides, I\u2122m the same as you. You are a Jew, and I am a Jew.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01How do you know that I am a Jew?\ufb02 \ufb01Well, look on your face, it\u2122s -- you can -- I can see you are Jewish.\ufb02 And then he ask from where are you, from where are you, so he said, \ufb01I am from Krak\u00f3w.\ufb02 She says, \ufb01From Krak\u00f3w where are you?\ufb02 My wife said, and -- and she\u2122s from Shtanuslabu. She said, \ufb01You know, I was in the Jewish -- in the Hebrew gymnasium, and there was a Jewish boy from Krak\u00f3w, whose name was Oscar Margoulis, he went with me to the Hebrew gymnasium.\ufb02 And when he heard Oscar USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 43 Margoulis, he -- he almost fainted. So i -- Oscar Margoulis is my first cousin. So he -- and he asked her what happened to him, so he had the best proof that she\u2122s telling the truth, and he came in, and he said to me -- he calls me in the corn er, and he said, \ufb01You know, this -- this pretty girl,\ufb02 and she was very pretty, \ufb01this pretty girl, she is not a German. She\u2122s not even Polish, she\u2122s Jewish.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01You are crazy. How can she be Jewish here?\ufb02 So he -- and he was a womanizer, every girl he wanted to have. So I said, \ufb01You know,\ufb02 -- and Januk was his name, \ufb01you know, Januk, you are so -- if you had found Eva Braun,\ufb02 -- you know who Eva Bra un was, yeah? \ufb01You would make from her a Jews just to have to go to sleep with her.\ufb02 So she said no -- he said, \ufb01No, you go and f -- prove yourself -- you cannot -- she proved it to me, she wen,\ufb02 -- so I said, \ufb01Yeah, she proved it, you are even -- told them that she showed you that she\u2122s circumcised.\ufb02 So -- so then later I started to interrogate her. And in the beginning she didn\u2122t want to cooperate, then later -- I didn\u2122t want to ask her if she is Jewish, because the people -- there was the janitor, were there three other, and this was very dangerous, because Krak\u00f3w was not completely liberated. The Germans sometimes made a [indecipherable] and they found the Jews came out, and they killed them. So -- so I ask her, \ufb01Do you speak other languages?\ufb02 She said, \ufb01Yes, I speak German, I speak,\ufb02 -- of course she spoke in Polish -- \ufb01I speak Russian, and I speak Hebrew, and I speak English.\ufb02 So I said, \ufb01English?\ufb02 And I spoke a little English. See I -- I learned English. The only time I find out I don\u2122t speak English is when I came to the United States. So -- so I -- I remember I ask her from which nation are you, and she said, \ufb01Jewish.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01How can you prove it?\ufb02 She said, \ufb01I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 44 can speak Hebrew.\ufb02 So I said, \ufb01Speak to me Hebrew.\ufb02 She said, \ufb01Wa -- how can I speak -- I speak to you Hebrew? You don\u2122t understa nd what I am saying, because look in your face, y-you -- you -- you don\u2122t -- you look like a Polish anti-Semite.\ufb02 And she started to tell me that I shouldn\u2122t bother her. Well, [indecipherable] when she spoke Hebrew, I thought oh, she is Jewish, or maybe the Germans -- she\u2122s not, maybe the Germans taught her to speak Hebrew, and she would go out and s-spy on Jews, and -- so I asked her this time, I asked her, \ufb01Tell me, when do Jews pray K oniterra?\ufb02 Koniterra, this is a prayer that we pray in Yom Kippur. And without thinki ng, she answered Yom Kippur. Then when -- when she said Yom Kippur, she started -- she stopped, and she said, \ufb01Wait a second, wait a second. How do you know ab out Yom Kippur?\ufb02 She said, \ufb01You wa -- don\u2122t tell me,\ufb02 she said, \ufb01you -- you -- you -- you -- you, too, you too?\ufb02 So -- and she started -- and she had tears in her eyes. So I said, \ufb01Yes, I too, I too.\ufb02 And then later, so I knew that she is Jewish, and she knew that I am Jewish, then I told her what I need, said I need the plans. She said, \ufb01Why didn\u2122t you tell me right away, I would gi -- I have the plans.\ufb02 And she went with me to the other room, and she ope ned the safe, she had the safe, and she gave me the plans. Now also, before we went in there, now -- so we, between us, we spoke -- we said, \ufb01Well, if we will get the plans,\ufb02 -- we didn\u2122t know if it\u2122s a woman, if it\u2122s a man, now somebody has to kill the person, because if we got some information like this, the person had to be liquidated, because in case let\u2122s say sh e would give me the plans, she could notify her superiors that we already ha ve the plans, and she would spoil the whole thing. So -- and then when we f -- when we find out there is a woman, so they s -- it came USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 45 -- it fell on me, why? Because a day before we did a job, something similar like this, this so -- they did it, so they said, \ufb01Now, it\u2122s your part.\ufb02 It means that I had to do it. And -- but when she gave me the plans, so we ha d the -- if she wouldn\u2122t give us -- if she wouldn\u2122t -- I wouldn\u2122t find out she is Jewish, I definitely would shoot her. Not -- she shouldn\u2122t call up her -- and -- to the -- so -- so then later she gave me the plans, and the plans were exactly how then -- the columns, everything. So I brought it over to the -- to the Russian intelligence, which we -- we worked together, and they had the plans, so they send out engineers and they -- and they did everything that it shouldn\u2122t be -- yeah, because when she gave me the plans, so she said to me -- she said to me -- so I said, \ufb01I have to run,\ufb02 took the plan, because any minut e the columns will blow up. She said, \ufb01No, don\u2122t worry, they wouldn\u2122t blow up, because, \ufb02 -- I asked her why. \ufb01Cause,\ufb02 she said, \ufb01two days before, I got a phone call for the camp\u2122s commandant from Krak\u00f3w, from that commander in Krak\u00f3w, and he ask if this is the company Meyerader and Krauss, I said yes, and -- and so he said -- he didn\u2122t ask questions , he only said, Springen zie dez oilen.\ufb02 So detonate the columns, because before her boss left, he told her that she will get a phone call, that in -- they would tell her that the columns have to be destroyed. Se -- I mean, dek -- will be detonated. So she got this phone call, springen zie dez oilen. Now, he didn\u2122t ask who she is, but she didn\u2122t -- she -- he didn\u2122t ask, s-she was not afraid in case she wouldn\u2122t do it, which they will come to her. So meanwhile when she got this telephone -- so she notified the Akar, the Polish underground, because she wa -- was a member of the Polish underground, and she told them that -- what the telephone was, and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 46 she was -- she was sure that they will come, and they will do somethi ng, but they didn\u2122t do anything. And then when -- and then -- okay."

            "answer": "The AK didn\u2122t do anything, they didn\u2122t tell us, and then later when we did it, [indecipherable], she thought it's done by the AK, but they didn\u2122t do anything. So -- so it was -- it was that the columns were taking away the electricity, but the columns were staying there for about four weeks til they destroyed it. And this is how Krak\u00f3w was saved. Actually, she was the one who saved Krak\u00f3w. And then after, when I came to America, there were films, reports, and ther e were about 20 different versions how this happened, because everybody knew that it was prepared for detonation, and there was different versions. There was even a book ca me out r -- r -- out in Russian, it\u2122s called, \ufb01Miore Vihar.\ufb02 There\u2122s a Miore Vihar, a Major Vihar -- Vihar, it was [indecipherable], that he did it, and that was ma de a film, the film was so important that it was serialized on television. All right, a Miore Vihar was there, but he describes that he was the hero as if he got the -- then was a other film, and they -- they portrayed the pope when he was a young fellow, and that the pope was the one who find out about it, and he came, he cut the wires. I saw the film, the pope wasn\u2122t th ere. He was in Krak\u00f3w, but he didn\u2122t have USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 47 anything to do. And there were other -- ot her versions how it is , because nobody knew about it, she didn\u2122t -- they didn\u2122t know til our book came out. When our book, \ufb01Against All\ufb02 sa -- \ufb01All Odds\ufb02 came out, so we wrowt -- write about it, so they then -- University Agaloinski, Agaloinion in Krak\u00f3w find out abou t this, so they invited us we should come to Krak\u00f3w, that I should come with my wife, but we didn\u2122t go. I didn\u2122t want to go to Poland. I wrote them a letter, and -- and this -- and this was the end of this episode, that she actually saved -- saved the town, the most historical town from Krak\u00f3w. I don\u2122t know if she saved it hundred percent, or she had a part in it, that it was not if she -- if she would say to the camp\u2122s commandant that nobody\u2122s there to detonate, they will send over some people. And you also must know one thing. Now, you would ask a question, why did the German high command call up, and that\u2122s it, and they let it go. You see, when a ger -- when the army goes forwards, like the German army went forwards, there was never a better army in the world. Everything was so accurate, poom. And this was also the -- the problem with the Holocaust, because they were so accurate sa -- during the Holocaust, they made everything so perfect, that everyt hing was in order. The same thing with the German army. When they went forwards towards Russia, everything was so perfect, it was the best army. But, when the German army retreated, it -- it was no different than -- it was same as the Egyptian army retreated in the Negev, you remember in the Six Day War? When the Egyptian army retreated without shoes, with out pants, without underwear. Yeah, this is how the German army was, because when the army goes forwards, and specially when it\u2122s well or ganized like the Germans, everything -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 48 everything is in order. But when the army re treats, nothing is in order, no command, no -- nobody knows what the other is doing. And fo r the same thing, when they left Krak\u00f3w, everything was disorganized, there was no command, so for this reason, they didn\u2122t follow up with the destruction of Krak\u00f3w."

            "answer": "Well, in Krak\u00f3w in that time, it was chaos. Everything was falling apart, and -- and we had to put together that Krak \u00f3w it should -- it should function. Now, we were the first Polish unit who came into Krak\u00f3w, cause it was occupied by the Russians. And the Polish unit was not a big unit, and then later more came in, and we took over the administration, til about two, three months later, where there was a civil administration. And -- and -- and first we had to clean out Krak\u00f3w from all collaborators, because there USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 49 were a lot of Polish collaborators who wo rked with the Germans, who worked -- especially the Polish police, the Polish police who were in-incorporated into the German police. We used to call it in Polish granna toppa policia. It means the navy blue granna -- the navy blue police, because they had navy blue uniforms, but this was the police from before the war, and they didn\u2122t behave so hundred percent like the Polish people desired. Well, there were some who belonged to the underground illegally, but the majority, they worked with the German -- they were collaborators. So now we had to clean out the Polish police which were collaborators. There were a lot of volksdeutshen. The volksdeutshen lived there, and the volksdeut shen had full rights under the Germans. And when the volksdeutshen, when they were di -- discovered, naturally some of them were arrested, some -- some were collaborators open ly, and their apartments were confiscated. And this was -- this was mostly -- this wa s mostly the work for us. Also, the Polish government had a big problem, because as you know, in Warsaw, in August 1944, was the uprise in Warsaw. And the uprise -- the Polish people wanted to have the uprise in Warsaw, and to declare a free Poland wi -- go -- government. But the Russians did -- it was a trick what they did, as their [indecipherable] went forwards, they were quite -- quite successful, and when they cam e to the Vistula, to the east r -- side of the Vistula, which is the river, this -- the Russians stopped. They -- their excuse was that the -- the -- their supply line ended, but this was not true. They stopped because the Polish people wanted to be very smart, and they wanted , when -- as the Russians approached Krak\u00f3w, so they wanted to make the uprise, and the Germans were -- had involve with the Russian USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 50 front 10 divisions, so they figured they were busy -- busy with the Russian front, and they will make the uprise, and they will establish an -- a free Poland government. But the Russians said well, they thought we are fighting, and they didn\u2122t want the Polish to establish a free Poland, which the government was in exile in London. Se -- they wanted to have a Communist regime. So they stopped, and naturally then they withdrew, the Germans withdrew the 10 divisions, they brou ght them to Warsaw, and they suppressed them -- their uprise, and -- and they killed 200 fighters, they killed 200 civilians. They didn\u2122t kill them just like Jews, you take them to extermination camp, but they were killed fighting. And then they took 400 civilians, and they took them as prisoners. They put -- put to a town there, and -- and then -- then th -- about a few months later, the Russians made the last offensive, and they occupied Wa rsaw. So -- so -- so in con -- so tha -- all th-the -- the -- the b -- the manage -- the big shots from the uprise, who were not killed, who were not taken as prisoners , they moved the whole headquarters from the uprise to Krak\u00f3w. And then Krak\u00f3w had to be the sa me uprise as in Warsaw. When the Germans will leave, they want to make the uprise. So they were in Krak\u00f3w. So this was one also of the reasons that -- about the destruction, they wanted to make destruction we -- there were three reasons actually. The first reason was that they wanted to make this destroy because they were afraid for a other uprise like in Warsaw. The second reason in -- in -- was because they wanted to slow down the Russian approach. If the town will be destroyed, so they will slow down. The third reason was because the Germans considered Krak\u00f3w as a German town, and they cou -- like they always -- like all the scientists from USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 51 before, and they always said that they were Germans, not Polish. So they considered that this a Polish tow -- as a German town. And then when they -- they had to leave it, so they -- they didn\u2122t want to leave it [indecipherable] . They said well if we cannot have it, we will destroy it. So those were the three reasons, but actually the biggest reason was that they wanted to destroy the town, because they couldn\u2122t live with it that Poland should get the town untouched. Because in Krak\u00f3w there was never bomb, in Krak\u00f3w was never the house destroyed, so they wanted to destro y the whole town. Now, would this work, the 287 mines, Krak\u00f3w would -- not one house w ould be left, because they -- the way they mined, and they put in the columns, it was the whole town would be blown up. Naturally with the pe -- and people, there were hundred maybe -- hu -- hu -- thousands, and thousands of people would be killed. So -- so this was the reason, because the uprise had to be in Krak\u00f3w the same way."

So the next day, or two days later, I took my adjutant, a nd -- and I -- and we had everything, so I remember I made the package salami, and -- and -- and -- and butter, and everything, I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 52 made the package and I send it to her.

Somebody kept him, and he was under the floor, he was laying, he only came -- they fed him, gave him something, but he never came out. And people started to come out, they didn\u2122t have what to eat, because even the Polish people didn\u2122t have what to eat. So she wrote me that she needs more food , she needs more food, so every day I raised -- see, I didn\u2122t see her -- every day I raised instead -- yesterday I send her two loaves of bread, the next day I se nd her four loaves of bread, one salami I send before, and each time I send it because I had those things. And she wrote that she is giving this to people who came out. And th e people who came out find out that there is somebody who has food. So they came to us, and she gave them.

So I -- I send over -- oh, I think I came over in this time, and I made out an -- an -- I typed out an -- a paper that I lived there, that I took over the apartment, I put it on the door. Once I put in door, nobody touched it, and she could stay there. I was not st aying there, but this -- so then I didn\u2122t see her again for a -- for a few weeks, and yeah -- and then she -- and -- and we started also, to arrest a lot of German volksdeutshen, and we took away their apartments and they left a lot of stuff, the apartment, so -- so I -- I gave her a lot of clothing what I got from the people, so every -- so I gave her that. About a few weeks later she came to my office and she said she had to register to the army, because in her year, she -- sh -- sh -- they had to register. They took women to the army, too.

So she didn\u2122t go to army, and then later I started to go out with her, and then each time a little more, and -- and this is how we started, and -- to go out til -- til we were ready to -- to be married, but we didn\u2122t get married in Krak\u00f3w, we -- I was transferred to Breslau, and then she came after me to Breslau.

So we had a discussion about it, and she said no, she cannot do it, because she had a sister, and a grandmother, and uncles in Palestine in this time, and she wouldn\u2122t like -- she would like eventually to go to them. Now, with me was a different story. I -- I had family in America, but it wou -- didn\u2122t USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 56 mean so much to me. So, to me the different story I told her, I wouldn\u2122t like to cut off because -- see, by Jews, there is a sect, we call it Cohamin, the priestly tribe. Now, the priestly tribe -- now I am -- the priestly tribe started with Aaron, the brother of Moses. And this goes on for 4,000 years.

Who knows, maybe his grandfather, his great-grandfather was killed because he was a Jew.

And naturally, our dream was to go to Palestine, we never dreamt about America. We ne -- we wanted -- specially me, I wanted to go to Palestine because if somebody would tell me that see, I was in the underground, in the Polish army, if somebody will tell me that I would be in Palestine, and I would be able to fight for a Jewish state one day, one day to have a rifle in my hand, and they will say the next day you will be killed, I will always agree .That if I could fight one day for my homeland, not for strangers, and then I could be killed, I would be very happy. So, we wanted to go to Palestine. So then there were the things -- reasons why we didn\u2122t go to Palestine, because you couldn\u2122t go that j -- if you was a -- were illegal. So they took the people, they send USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 57 them to Cyprus, so we said we\u2122ll go to America, and -- and we will go to -- which one will come first, Palestine or America, and then from America we can always go to Palestine.

            "answer": "I -- I run away to Munich. First I went out to Berlin, and I was in Berlin, and from Berlin, I -- see, I went -- I run through Gearlies, and then from Gearlies I went to Berlin. And in Berlin I started to work, we -- we call it here -- we called it Bricha. This was a organization that it means escape. W -- I started to work in Poland in the Bricha, so we -- we took Jews who wanted to escape, and we smuggled them through the border. And then my job was, from Berlin, I took the groups of Jews to Munich, because I -- we couldn\u2122t take them to the American zone, first I had to go from Munich. I -- I took them to the -- to the English zone. I remember I made th-there some acquaintances in Ashfaiger, you know where that is? And through Ashfaiger we took them, and -- and then to Munich, and in Munich some body else took over, and they took the Jews to Italy, and from Italy they smuggled them on ships, and th ey were caught in Cyprus. So I worked in -- in this Bricha a few months, then later I find out my wife came [indecipherable] my wife came, so -- so we got an apartment in -- in Munich. And see, she wanted to go to school, but then later we figured we have to - we have to get out. So we registered -- we registered to -- to Palestine, what I just said, to America. We said, which will be first, and there we\u2122ll go. So America came first, and also, it was a very, very big problem, because all the DPs who wanted to come to America, hardly they could make it, because in the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 60 consulate -- in American consulate in Muni ch, there was one woman, she was one of the secretaries, and she had some friend, and they had a business. And then -- and then they -- an-and there was a vice-consul, and he was also a partner, and everybody who wanted to come in front of the consul to have the application asking questions, we had to pay her 500 dollars. And people didn\u2122t have 500 dollars, and if you didn\u2122t pay 500 dollars, so they didn\u2122t forward the -- the -- the papers. And -- and also, when they came to the consul, the consul asked for birth certific ates, and passports. Nobody had their birth certificate, I mean they were all survivor s from the camp. So nobody could -- could go. So one -- and see my wife spoke quite good English, she had six years English. So in this -- nobody could go and do something, so one day there was the -- the then chief consul, his name was Clark, in Munich, so we wa ited -- we waited when he came back from lunch, so my wife and I, we stopped him, and she started to tell him the story, that Jews cannot go because first they had to pay money. And the second thing, who will have an -- a passport, a birth certificate? We came from concentration camps. And she -- he listened, and when he listened, I remember she explained to him everything, then later, after, when we stopped talking, so he went to us, and he put the hand on our head, he was a tall guy, yeah. So he said, \ufb01Don\u2122t worry. We need people like you in America.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01I will,\ufb02 -- and he gave out new orders. First thing, he fired the secretary, and he gave out new orders that we don\u2122t need from the concentration camps -- people in concentration, those documents, only what we need is two witnesses, that they know the person is from here and there, and this is sufficient. So the people started to come. Now, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 61 for instance, all the German people who made applications to go to g -- to America, they all got visas, because they had their papers, they could come in. And mostly people, their husbands were in -- in the army, in the SS, and then -- they all were welcome, so we told them all those things, that they -- why should th ey have the priority, and after this, all the [indecipherable], it ended, then the people from the camps, they thanked us, that we made out that she is it -- they changed the whole law, and then we came to America."

So I told them what they could do more. So they said they didn\u2122t know about it. So I went -- the next day I went to the -- th-the Jewish pi -- to the forwas that is a Jewish forwas, and I picked out -- they had microfilms, and I pi cked out microfilms from the time where we USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 66 were destroyed, for the time of July \u212242, August \u212242. And every day, in the re -- paper every day were articles about what was going on, which came porskal -- maybe it was not in the New York Times, the New York Ti mes maybe there was something on the -- on page 18, a piece of this, but in the forwas, there was every day in ice -- I had my -- and then later, when we came to a next meeting, and when the rabbi agai n said so, I said to him, \ufb01It\u2122s not true, because I just looked over them, and that was mentioned every single day.\ufb02 And we were very bitter, because in the beginning -- in the beginning the people in America didn\u2122t want -- we started to tell stories, nobody wanted to listen. And if somebody listened, they thought that we are -- we got nervous breakdowns, that the -- we told them stories that it is not true, because how can somebody listen and imagine that somebody deliberately takes six million people and kill. It\u2122s not -- and you talk about six million people like -- like a -- once I saw in the New York Times, an article on one page, six million Jews were killed. In the next pages, six million stocks were sold today on the stock market, in the same breath. So, w-w-w-we couldn \u2122t understand how -- people couldn\u2122t believe it. Not only -- you see, when the Germans killed six million Jews, if they will kill the six million Jews the first day when they came in, it will be a terrible thing, they killed six million people, but it will not be so terrible. The terrible thing is for six years they tortured the people. They starved them, they beat them, they died from sickness, and all those things. Then, on the top, then finally, they killed them. Take for instance the Jews who survive concentration camps. Jews were in Auschwitz, some for three, four years. And then later, when the Russians were already next to the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 67 concentration camp, they had to be liberated, they took them on dead marches that all of them died. Being three, four years in the camp, without food, and they had to walk without clothing, in this cotton dress, wit hout underwear, without shoes, without food. And if somebody fell down because it was sli ppery, even no f -- s-- strong people they would fell down. The minute they fell down, he was shot. Now, the German soldiers, they were all dressed in fur jackets, in fur coats, with heavy boots and everything, and they went with them. Here they had to be liberated. So this is the cruelty. They had to -- they had to take them on marches to be killed. So this killi ng was not so terrible if they would do it the first day, but after six days -- six years, to be destroyed. Take, for instance, Demjanjuk. You know the story about De mjanjuk, that he was a guard in tr -- in Belzyce, he was the man who operated -- and in Treblinka, who operated the gas chambers th-there. Now, Demjanjuk, his bigge st pleasure was when they brought in the Jews, and they were naked, and they walked through the maze , to go in in the dead ca -- t-to the gas chamber, to the -- to the room. Demjanjuk and others like him, were standing there laughing, and everyone -- every time wh en they saw a young girl, with the firm breast, yeah, they went and cut off the breast, or stabbed there. Al -- it\u2122s a -- it was a joke. They knew that in 15 minutes this person will be killed, but before the person was killed, they had to stab her, they had to cut off he r breast. Those are the terrible things, the cruelty. The cruelty was -- now I\u2122m ri -- reading a book, Treblinka, and the cruelty in Treblinka is that every day they brought in transports, thousands and thousands of people. The people who worked there, they couldn\u2122t lift up their head, they had to run with their USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 68 head down. Why? Because there were special people, special Germans and Ukrainian helpers, that they hit them with -- with -- with some sticks, or with some rubber hoses, and the minute -- and at night, when there wa s the appelle, when they was the roll call, and when they saw somebody ha d a sign on his face, he was taken, they called it to the hospital, to be liquidated. So they had to ru n around with their head down they shouldn\u2122t be marked. So the cruelty was so terrible. It\u2122s not the killing, but now how can people be so cruel that you take a guard, let\u2122s say, in Auschwitz. A whole day he goes and he kills the children, but he had there his wife with his children. At night he went over and he played with his children, with his dog, with his cat. Li ke -- like nothing happened. And the next day again he went out, and he killed. There were people who went over to Vienna for the weekends. A whole week they were staying in a concentration camp, killing, killing, killing. And then for the weekend he goes home, he goes to the opera with his wife. He goes to parties with his wife, he goes to dances with his wife. He enjoys his children during that weekend, and Monday morning he goes back and he kills again. So how can you imagine that there are people on this world that they are not -- they are not human beings, and they are not even animals, because animals wouldn\u2122t do a thing like this. But they did it day after day, year after year, kill -- they killed six million innocent people. And they played around with their children, they were beautiful children. Their children were beautiful, but the Jewish children had to be killed. This is the tragedy. The tragedy is that how people can do things like this, and what made them do? After all, the German people didn\u2122t come out from tha -- from jungles. They didn\u2122t come out from USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 69 underground, this was not 5,000 years ago. Even 5,000 years ago people wouldn\u2122t do it. Now this was the 20th century. The 20th century, a nation who created a Getta, who created a Schiller, who created a Mozart, who created such -- such geniuses? How could a nation j -- sink so low, and then later you sp eak to them, you sp -- I -- I feel bad I\u2122m talking this to you, because --"

Now he said he doesn\u2122t know anything about it, he was a victim, he was in the Russian as a prisoner. So this what we cannot understand, how people, normal people in the 20 th century, intelligent people -- now, take for instance the Einsatzgruppen, you know what the Einsatzgruppen are. The Einsatzgruppen are, when they took over the Russian territory, they didn\u2122t send the people to concentration camps. When they took over a town, the Einsatzgruppen came in, and they killed all the Jews. They made ditches, they killed them, women, children, old men, everybody. Now the Einsatzgruppen were volunteers. This was not soldiers that they said well, you have to go to the Einsatzgruppen, all volunteers. And which USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 71 volunteers? Mostly were graduate -- people who graduate high sc hool, who graduate musi -- in universities, who had professions; lawyers, doctors, they were in the Einsatzgruppen. Now, how can people who we re educated become such murderers? People ask me now questions. What do you th ink about the second generation, what do you think about the new generation? I said , \ufb01If the new generation knows what their parents did, what their grandparents did, maybe they would unde rstand something.\ufb02 But they don\u2122t know, because the grandparents and the parents don\u2122t want to speak about it. They are quiet. Nobody was in the Einsatzgruppen, nobody was in the Gestapo, nobody was in the SS. The SS was only volunteers, th e volunteers in the SS. Now, people say -- everybody say -- now I have a speech now -- everybody -- everybody says, well, this what the Nazis did, this what the Nazis did. I am very angry. I never use the word Nazi. And if you see my book, in my book you don\u2122t have once a Nazi. And I always ask that question, why do you say Nazi ? There were 90 million Germans, eight million belonged to the party, which you can tell them, they were members of the Nazi party? What happened to 82 million? So 82 million were staying home and saving Jews? What happened to the 82 million? So I said, you don\u2122t have to say Nazis did it, the Germans did it, with their collaborators. Nazis were in the party. Okay, some had bigger jobs, some had smaller jobs, but the Germans did it. An d I am very much -- every time when I go and somebody has a speech, and he talks borgas about Nazis, I always get up, and I always say please, don\u2122t use Nazis. And I tell them why. I tell, because the Germans did it. In the beginning maybe there were some Germans who were against Hitler. They were USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 72 Communists, they were Socialists, but then later, everybody was pro-Hitler, why not? Hitler went to ge -- to France. They didn\u2122t have cognac so much. They brought over all the cognac to fran -- from France. They didn\u2122t have en ough butter, they went to Denmark, to Holland, brought over all the bu tter and the cheese, and they gave it to the people. They went -- they didn\u2122t have wheat, they didn\u2122t have corn, rye. They went to the Ukraine, brought over everything from the Ukraine. They didn\u2122 t have coal, they went to Poland, they brought over everything from Poland. So naturally the one who were against him, later they became -- they were in love with him. Why? Because they had br -- butter, they have cognac, they had bread, they had everything. Why? Because they took it away from the people. Money? They had plenty of money. They had special people, they called them the dentists. In every concen -- d-death camp, after they killed the people, there were special people, they knocked out the gol d teeth, and they got tons of gold, which they send it to Switzerland, and they exchange it for money. Whenever you start to think about all those things, I mean, they fit, but a human being, can a human being think about it, that a thing like this happened in the 20th century?"

            "answer": "Yes, yes, I accuse the Jewish community also, because -- and I give you exan -- again example. Now, I accuse that from all the American president, the worst president in United State was Roosevelt, be cause Roosevelt could do so much, he could save so many Jews, he didn\u2122t. He didn\u2122t. He said -- there was a interview with Jan Karski, a Polish runner from Poland what came to him, and he even describes the way Roosevelt was sitting. So Roosevelt was sitting smoking the cigar, and he said, \ufb01After the war, we will punish the guilty, after the war.\ufb02 But during the war he didn\u2122t do anything. You know how many Jews could be saved? The Jews were one -- th-they -- from friends, when -- when it was the Vichy government that wanted to send all the Jews to north Africa, the American government didn\u2122t let them do it. There was a cordy -- Hill, he was the Secretary of State. He didn\u2122t allow it, for two reasons. The first reason, he didn\u2122t want to annoy the Arabs, so let the Jews be killed. And then he said we could not afford -- we didn\u2122t have enough trucks. They let the Jews be killed. Now, I\u2122ll give you an example. I had a brother in America, my brother was here from 1920. When we were in the ghetto in our small town, once we received a package from Turkey, in the ghetto, and we didn\u2122t know who sent the package, and di -- they delivered the package, and this was a package that there were things that we never dreamt that this exist in the world. There was a can of coffee, there was a package of cheese, two packages of chocolate, two sar -- packages of sardines. So I -- sugar, everything was in this package. My mother rece -- two salamis. My mother rec -- when we received it, she took the salami, she\u2122s -- put in slices, and everybody tried got a slice. We got this package, every -- the whole town envied us. We USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 74 got the -- we didn\u2122t know from where the pa ckage cames, came from Turkey. When I came to America, I ask my brother, \ufb01Did you ever send a package to us?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Yes, there was once in the paper, that for 15 dollars, you can buy a package in Turkey, and it will be sent anyplace in Europe.\ufb02 So he went and he paid 15 dollars, and they sent the package. I ask him, \ufb01How many packages did you send?\ufb02 He said one. Why one? He said, \ufb01Well, I didn\u2122t receive an answer that you received it.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01We were in the ghetto.\ufb02 I ask him, \ufb01Could you afford every da y to send 50 dolla -- 15 dollars?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Yes, business was wonderful, we did a lot of business during the war.\ufb02 I ask him, \ufb01Did you go to the theater?\ufb02 Yes. \ufb01Did you go to the movies?\ufb02 Yes. \ufb01Did you go during the war to restaurants? How much cost a dinner in the restaurant? Couldn\u2122t you take every day 15 dollars and throw it out? Maybe, maybe somebody would received it. But you didn\u2122t do it. You sent one package, and we received it.\ufb02 Imagine if we would receive every day a package. Not only we, the whole family would have everything, we could sell it. Nobody did it. Then he, when I came over here, he cried. He had five sisters, all the sisters are dead. I said, \ufb01What did you do to save the sisters?\ufb02 \ufb01I -- what could I do?\ufb02 I gave him 20 things that he could do. He didn\u2122t do it."

            "question": "Tell me -- tell me a few.",
            "answer": "All right, tell me a few. The first thing, before the war, when we knew already what\u2122s going on in Germany, we wrote letters, we begged him, send us an affidavit. Nobody send it back. You know how much it would co st him to send affidavit? 25 cents. Why 25 cents? He had to notarize the affidavit. If he would do work with the bank, the bank will USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 75 notarize it for free. If he wouldn\u2122t do work with the bank, he would go to the drugstore, the [indecipherable] was a notary, and he will ask him to sign, he pay 25 cents. So for 25 cents, he could send affidavit. He didn\u2122t send affidavit, we asked him. And the same thing the other family members, too. This is the first thing. They knew what\u2122s going on in Germany, nobody thought about bringing ove r somebody. They lived in freedom i-in America. Af -- during the war, packages. They could pay in packages. Then the other thing I ask them, \ufb01Did you ever think about it, you did business a lot, to go to Turkey, to go to Switzerland, to go to any neutral country, and to be there, and maybe for money, to bribe, to give some German official money, and he could do something somebody should come out.\ufb02 There were Jews who did it. I know rabbis who were taken out during the time from ghettos, because they had followers here. They had followers in America, and they went out and they bribed . Germans liked money. Fo-For -- for money you could do a -- the Gestapo could be bribed. I said, \ufb01Why didn\u2122t you go, you -- you were here making -- making money, why didn\u2122t you go there to Turkey? In Turkey there were special Germans that they made arrangements. You paid them off, you could bring over the famil -- or some from the family. You didn\u2122t do it.\ufb02 \ufb01I didn\u2122t think about it.\ufb02 \ufb01Now you are crying they are dead? Now when I survived already the war, I wrote to you -- I wrote to you to send me affidavit, did you send me an affidavit? No. This was already after the war. So the Joint Distribution Committee had to send me affidavit, and they paid for the affidavit. I had a brother here. You didn\u2122t do it.\ufb02 A other thing. My -- I had a -- I had a brother-in-law, and he came from a ver -- from a rabbinical family. And once, in 1937, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 76 one of the rabbis came for a visit to us. And he was his cousin. When he went back, so my brother-in-law said to him, \ufb01You know, my wife has uncles, one is a doctor, one is a dentist, one is a manufacturer. See if they could send us the affidavits.\ufb02 He went to America, and we didn\u2122t hear anything. So we -- he wrote a letter to this rabbi, he said, \ufb01Well, we asked th -- we asked you to see the family.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01I saw the family. I called them, they didn\u2122t answer. I went to their home, and I told them the whole story, that you want to come, you want to go, you are a neph ew with your wife, with the children.\ufb02 But nobody did anything. They didn\u2122t say anythi ng, and they didn\u2122t send you affidav -- only what they needed is affida -- and they were rich, they could do it. So you see, you ask about the Jewish community, the Jewish community didn\u2122t do anything. There was only one s -- group of the Jewish community, it\u2122s ca lled -- oh, I -- I -- you see, I forgot the names, I -- I know [indecipherable] all right. There was a religious group, they were very religious Jews, and they got together -- Vadatsalla, this was the name. The Vadatsalla got together money, and they sent over a delegation, and pulled few people to the countries what I told you. And if they had outstanding Jews, outs -- Jews, I mean rabbis, they brought them out from there. And they are survived, they send money. Now how come the Vadatsalla, a group of religious Jews could do it, and other Jews couldn\u2122t do it? Then we had here a rabbi who was in charge of Zionist organizations. No w when they find out from Switzerland that Hitler is killing all the Jews -- and they find it out, by the way, from a German industrialist in Switzerland. He came -- he couldn\u2122t take it, and he went to the representative from the Joint in swi -- in Switzerland, and he told them the whole USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 77 story. He sent telegrams to England, tele grams to America, telegrams to Roosevelt. Roosevelt called Rabbi Weiss, who was in charge , and he said to Rabbi Weiss, \ufb01Let\u2122s not rock the boats.\ufb02 And everything was quiet. This man told him everything what happened in the concentration camps, in the death camps. They said, \ufb01L et\u2122s not rock the boats,\ufb02 and nothing was done. So you blam e, naturally, the Germans, they did it. You blame the collaborators, the Ukrainians, the Croatians, the Slovaks, the Lithuanians, the -- the Latvians. They all did it. But the American Jews didn\u2122t do what they supposed to do."

            "answer": "The relationship of my brother was -- we ll, it was never a relationship like brothers, because he didn\u2122t know me, I didn\u2122t know him. But when I came, I wanted to know him, after losing my whole family. But it was never -- for instance, I needed a job. I came over here without money, without knowing the langua ge, without having a trade, so I needed - and also, I wanted -- my pride i -- was that I wanted to show that I can do something. Now, he had a big business, he had a tr -- a trucking business, and I asked him, after I couldn\u2122t get a job, I ask him he should employ me. So his excu -- his answer was -- he had a foreman, and the foreman told him -- no w, he was the boss, but the foreman told USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 78 him well, he shouldn\u2122t give me a job, because when they will have to deliver packages to stores, and my English is not so well, so how will I deliver the packages? So this was his excuse. In Poland, after the war, being 25 years, I could rose to a rank of a lieutenant colonel. But here, to deliver packages, I was not good, because I wouldn\u2122t read the addresses. So, it was not like -- like it should have been done, but according to the other family members, he was good , because the other family members were worse. I mean uncles, cousins, who were Americans. I give you a -- examples. I had -- my father had a first cousin here, his name was Showel Salishitz, he became one of the largest silk lining manufacturers. If somebody had a fur coat, the silk, the lining, came from his fa -- he had seven factories. He retired when I came, the children took over the -- the business. I went over to him with one uncle, I had one uncle was very nice , he was the poor uncle, he never made a living. He didn\u2122t have time to make a living becaus e everything was on his head. So he went over with me, and we went over, and so it was a Sunday morning, so he said, \ufb01You know, I don\u2122t own the business, my son Saul has the business. But if you will go to him, he probably would give you a jo b, because we have 300 people working by us.\ufb02 I went over to him, was on a Sunday mornin g, I put in my best suit, a European suit. It was not so fashionable in America, but for me it was good. I came in, and there was the receptionist, a beautiful, blonde girl. And she ask me what I want. So I said to her as much as I spoke English, that I want to see Mr. Salishitz. \ufb01Who should I say is calling?\ufb02 So I said, \ufb01Tell him it\u2122s his cousin from Euro pe.\ufb02 After a few minutes she took me in. He was sitting by a bis -- big desk, and I came in, I never saw him before. He ne -- he didn\u2122t USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 79 get up, he didn\u2122t give me a ce nt. And he was lick -- he looked at me, he said, \ufb01What can I do for you?\ufb02 I says, \ufb01Well, I saw you father ye sterday, and I\u2122m lookin g for a job, and he is my father\u2122s first cousin, so that mean s we are second cousins, we have the same name.\ufb02 This was before I changed the name. \ufb01So, he said you probably could give me a job.\ufb02 He looked at me, didn\u2122t say anything, he took out his wallet. He took out from the wallet a hundred dollar bill. He put it on the de sk, and he said, \ufb01Take it and get off my back.\ufb02 When he said it to me, I couldn\u2122t answer anything. I wanted to cry, but nothing came out. My eyes filled up with tears, and I looked at him, and the minute I looked with him -- at him, so I imagined w -- how would we be if he would come to Poland for a visit when I was in the military? And I imagined that I would make a special review, I will stay on the -- on the -- on the reviewing stand with him, the army will go through, the music will play, I will salute, and I will introduce this is my cousin from America. He said -- the money was laying on the floor -- on the table. Then he said, \ufb01Well, on the second thought, I will give it to the United Je wish Appeal, let them do what they want.\ufb02 And he took it and put it back in his wallet. I run out, and as I came in, where this receptionist was sitting, I burst out, not with a cry, I burst out like with a sob, like some [gasps]. I couldn\u2122t cry, I couldn\u2122t [inaudible ]. She said, \ufb01What happened, what happened? Should I call a doctor?\ufb02 I said no, and I went out to the hallway, and when I staying in the hallway, and I was crying. I was 27 years old. A man goes through, he sees I\u2122m staying there and crying, he said, \ufb01Hey mister, what\u2122s wrong?\ufb02 And I said to him, \ufb01Are you Jewish?\ufb02 He said yes. I said, \ufb01I wish you w ould be in Auschwitz.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Why are you USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 80 sending me to Auschwitz?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Why should my father be killed because he\u2122s a Jew, and you are sitting here, you have everything, and you are not being killed.\ufb02 And I tol -- I don\u2122t know why I told him this. I was -- when I came out, I was so bitter. So he said, \ufb01Hey mister, wa -- I want to know why you\u2122re telling me this.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I don\u2122t want to talk to you.\ufb02 Well, all those stories I have in this new book. He said to me, \ufb01Do you eat lunch?\ufb02 I said no. I said, \ufb01Come with me to eat lunch.\ufb02 I went with him, we went down to a -- to a cafeteria, he ask me what I want, I said, \ufb01No, I will have the same thing as you have.\ufb02 He ordered, I remember, and I will never forget, he ordered topcheese, sour cream, and chopped vegetable, radishes, and onions , and everything mixed up. He had it, I had it, it was wonderful. I a -- ate it, he said to me, \ufb01Do you want a other one?\ufb02 I said no. He said, \ufb01Now, tell me the story.\ufb02 So I told him the story about this. So happens that this man was a buyer in their company. He knew him. He says, \ufb01What I want is you should go with me up there, and you shou ld punch this son of a bitch in his mouth, and I want to see blood. Don\u2122t worry, nothing will happen to you, I will be with you.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01No, I don\u2122t want to go, but the one thing I can prom ise you is that so long as I will live, I will never speak to him again.\ufb02 He said -- we fini shed, he said, \ufb01Here is my card. Come and see me.\ufb02 But a few days later I came and saw him -- I remember his name was Louie Segal. See, things like this you don\u2122t forget. I came to him, and he was a converter. You know what a converter, they -- they send over raw material to be dyed, and everything, but anyway -- and he sold remnants. In this time I say remnants\u2122s, because there was a lot, it\u2122s remnants\u2122s. One is a remnant. I didn\u2122t know that you say [indecipherable]. So he USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 81 said to me, \ufb01I will give you every week a case of remnant, and will charge you what I pay for it, 45 cents a pound.\ufb02 He gave me a addre ss where to go and sell it. He said, \ufb01You go and sell it, and they will pay you three dollars 50 a pound.\ufb02 He could sell it, he sold his. He gave me a case of remnant, I picked it up, and I went to those people. I made -- every week I made a few hundred dollars. He did it every week. He was a stranger. Every time I came to him, he said, \ufb01I still want you should go with me to this son of a bitch.\ufb02 Always he said this. Then later something happened that he did something, it was not hundred percent, he lost all his connections, and I was out of it. Do -- yeah, so I\u2122m telling you an - a episode from my family. Tell you other ep isodes when I came over. So my family started in what should we do -- they called me the boyjik. You know, in Yiddish you say, a boy, a boyjik, yeah. They got together to think how they shoul d do -- I should make a living. And they brought me to a uncle whose son ha d the big factory from bluebell dungarees. You heard about blue baga -- bell -- well, a big factory. So they were sitting there from the family, started to talk, then, what should we do with him. So, the first thing is, we have to change his name, because he cannot have a name like Salishitz, a long name. So the family had different names, the family -- some had Sales, some had Sallis, some had Sanders, some had Saleeshi. All diffe rent names. They didn\u2122t get along with them, they didn\u2122t want to have the same name. My brother\u2122s name was Salsitz, I said Salsitz. Now the first name. What should be -- my name was Naftali, Naftali\u2122s not for America. Well, the name -- maybe we should make it from Nathan, for short is Nat. I didn\u2122t like the word Nat, because Russia, nyet means no, everything is no. So I said, \ufb01No, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 82 I don\u2122t like it.\ufb02 Norbert, there was alread -- there was already a Norbert, because every bro -- see, my father had seven sisters and brothers, all of them had children the same age, and when my grandfather died, Naftali, everybody had his son Naftali. So one was Norbert, no good, one was Nolan, so Nolan. And so on, and so on. So one said, \ufb01Well, what\u2122s about Norman?\ufb02 So I ask him, \ufb01Norman?\ufb02 \ufb01Yeah.\ufb02 Nathan, Nat, what I didn\u2122t like, so one said, \ufb01Well, how much can he make by a name, Nathan? The most he can make 35 dollars a week.\ufb02 So I ask him Norman, how can Norman -- oh, Norman\u2122s a better -- nice name, you can go up to 65 dollars. So I started to think in my head, I will live til 80 years, and I will make 30 dollars a week more by having the name Norman, just for the name I\u2122m going to die a millionaire. So I said, \ufb01I want to have Norman.\ufb02 They gave me Norman. So my name was Norman Salsitz. Then they said, \ufb01You have to have a cemetery plot. In America everybody has to have a cemetery plot.\ufb02 So I said, \ufb01I\u2122m 27 years old.\ufb02 \ufb01No, there is a saying in America, the saying is, it\u2122s better to have and not to need it, than to need it and not to have.\ufb02 They had a family cemetery plot, they sold me four plots. I didn\u2122t have children. Four plots for 300 dollars , you can pay it up. I still have it. Four -- solda -- cemetery plot. Then later a job. The most important thing, how\u2122s about a job? So one uncle said, \ufb01Well, you know, it wo uld be nice if he could be a salesman for the company.\ufb02 So the others said, \ufb01A salesman? He doesn\u2122t speak English, how can he go and [indecipherable]?\ufb02 Then on e said, \ufb01He can be a cutter.\ufb02 So the other one said, \ufb01A cutter? In the union? He will never get in the union.\ufb02 Then one said, \ufb01A designer.\ufb02 Well, anyway, everything was the union, the union. So one uncle was smart, and a cousin, he USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 83 said, \ufb01Well, if he can be a machine -- a ma -- to fix mach -- yeah, a machinist.\ufb02 No good. To fix machines he can be a independent cont ractor, he doesn\u2122t need the union, and he can fix the machines from your factory. Wonderful. So one said, \ufb01Do you know something about machines?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01There is one machine that I can take the machine apart blindfolded, I can put it together blindfolded, I know this machine through and through.\ufb02 \ufb01Good, good, is it a Singer machine?\ufb02 I said no. \ufb01So what kind of machine is it?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01A machine gun.\ufb02 When I said a machine gun, they all got quiet, and they knew -- because I knew I wouldn\u2122t get the job from them. So I walked out with a new name, with four pem -- pr -- family plots, no job."

Later, I went in, I be -- I got jobs. I got, during the first year, I got about 10 jobs. Most of the jobs I was fired, cause I have a big mouth.

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 84 Then later I became a peddler, you know what a peddler is? I used to sell from house to house things. There\u2122s a stories about the peddle r, I think. So then later I -- from peddler I advanced, I sold first socks, then later dresses, t-til I became -- I sold furniture, only furniture, I had a warehouse. So there was one man, he was a manufacturer of -- of furniture, I remember his name was Horowitz. He had his office on Canal Street in New York. So I went in, I wanted to buy some furniture. So the girl ask me down -- said, \ufb01What\u2122s your name?\ufb02 So I said, \ufb01I -- I\u2122m Mr. Salsitz.\ufb02 So the way she heard it, she thought I said that I am Mr. Saul Shit, because they wen -- so she calls up the man upstairs, and I could hear it, she said, \ufb01There is a man, but his name is Saul Shit.\ufb02 I went - so -- so I -- so she said to me, \ufb01Go up,\ufb02 and I went up.

So this was -- those are the -- the -- the -- the -- the s -- in the beginning, what I -- I told you there are some comical stories, but there -- there are -- it\u2122s true stories. And -- and -- and -- and this is how -- and then later, after I was a peddler, about -- about 10 years, then later I became a devel -- a builder. I got -- I got a customer, he was a Italian guy, his name was Joe Rulore, and he was -- he made a small stuff, like a sidewalk. I said, \ufb01Joe, everybody\u2122s a builder, why can\u2122t we become builders?\ufb02 He never was a builder. So I said, \ufb01You know what, I will buy a lot, and you put up the house.\ufb02 So I bought a lot to put in the first house USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 85 [indecipherable], and we made out all right.

            "answer": "Well, because I had people who I -- who were good to me. I had people wel -- those were -- you see like, for instance, my wife ha d an uncle here. She never knew him, in the end she never me -- this was a sister of her grandmother. When we came over, they became very cl -- they -- they -- they wanted to do anything for us. And they were practically strangers. I remember when I was a peddler, and it was before Christmas that I used to give out merchandise, and they paid me out two dollars a week, three dollars a week. I didn\u2122t have money in the beginning. So this man came, and he brought me a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 87 blank check, a signed check. He said, \ufb01You need the money, make it out as much as you want.\ufb02 I never used the check because it was not -- it was blank. I never use it. But he gave it to me. I mean, he gave it to me, I gave him back the check. So there were people who were very -- strangers, who were very good to me, and to my wife. But the people that I expect them to be good, they were not. The same thing in Poland. There were people, peasants I didn\u2122t know, and they were very -- they saved my life. But the people who I knew, they were not. Maybe the people who I knew, they thought that they had, because they know me, they have a right to do it. And the people who didn\u2122t know me did it because from the goodness of their heart. It was me or somebody else, that they would do it for everybody. But here in America, I was very, very disappointed. There were some who were very nice, who couldn\u2122t do -- like for instance, I remember I had here a first cousin. She\u2122s still alive. And the first cousin, I wanted to see her. I never saw her, because she was born in America. I know my father got gray on account of her, because she was already 32 years and she wasn\u2122t married. So here in Europe he was worrying -- he always -- my father, he had a habit, if he was worrying, he used to bite his beard, he had a long beard. So you -- so when he start to bite his beard, so my mother said, \ufb01What are you worried again because Frances is not married?\ufb02 She already knew. So when I came over here, she was -- she was already married, and I was here about six months, once I called her up, and I said to he r, \ufb01Frances, I\u2122m here already six months, I would like to see you.\ufb02 So she said, \ufb01Yeah, yeah, come over sometimes.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Sometimes is no good. Today is Sunday, I don\u2122t work, how\u2122s about if I will come over USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 88 today?\ufb02 She said, \ufb01Oh, today is no good, be cause I invited already some guests.\ufb02 She invited guests, which she was afraid to this animal should come and introduce me? We wanted to meet people, we wanted to get so mebody, we wanted to have friends. So she said -- when she told me -- she told me as I was in the telephone booth, because we didn\u2122t have a telephone. No, well -- she said, \ufb01Let\u2122s go -- let\u2122s see us sometimes.\ufb02 So I said, \ufb01What\u2122s wrong today?\ufb02 So she said, \ufb01I already invited some guests.\ufb02 So those were the things that they were -- but, like when instance my wife has a aunt from her -- the aunt di-didn\u2122t stay with -- with -- with her husband, but the husband was her father\u2122s brother. But when we came, she took us in like the ga -- we would be their ch ildren. But with the children, til today we are very close. There is a son who was our age, he didn\u2122t go out on a date if he wouldn\u2122t invite us to go on the same date. He took us the first time to Radio City, to show. And all those -- every place he went. There were people, but the people that you expected the most. And I have an a -- an answer for what. You see, my family, my father, from the seven sisters and brothe r, he was the only who remained home. All of them came over here in the nine t -- in the 1880\u2122s. One came -- and they were very poor. They come from a village. They never saw -- they never were educated. And they told their children -- well, they children went already to college, you know, they were [indecipherable] they got professions. They told their children their life, how they lived in this village, in the 1880\u2122s. When we came, they looked at us with the same eyes. Why? Because they forgot, or they didn\u2122t know that America had a progress from 1880 to 1947. We had a progress in our house -- in our home. Maybe not so fast as here. They couldn\u2122t USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 89 understand, they ask my wife what she will do. She said, \ufb01Well, I studied medicine home, I would like to continue.\ufb02 But this was out of question. She said, \ufb01I can be a teacher. I can be a Hebrew teacher.\ufb02 They showed us, \ufb01You see here hair? Like hair will grow here, so can you be a teacher.\ufb02 \ufb01Why?\ufb02 \ufb01To be a teacher here you have to go to college.\ufb02 She said, \ufb01I went to college.\ufb02 They couldn\u2122t understand this. Why? Because they knew the stories from their parents, and they looked at us like we would come out from this village in 1880. And for this reason they had a differe nt feel. Now, for instance, I told my wife, \ufb01We go to America, and we\u2122ll have a lot of friends, because all my cousins are my age. So we will have something in common.\ufb02 They never invited us to -- to go out with them, they never invited us to go to a theater together."

There was a Major Wiser, he was a major of the English army, and he was actually from South America, but he was in the English army. He came over here, he organized a group, and he called it the George Washington Legion. And he USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 94 wanted to have a group here to be equipped in America, like there was once a Irish army that they went there. And he wanted to go with this group to Palestine, in this time before Israel was a state, in to fight. And I was involved with this group, and we had me -- had meetings every single week, and he, because on my background from Poland, I became the head of the military police in this group, because we had to have a military police. Well, anyway, we had to go, and we had quite a bit volunteers, and we also had, between -- we had mostly Jews, veterans, but y -- we also had a few Black who joined us, who went -- came up in the ran -- but we also had a few Irish. Now, the Irish veterans, they said they didn\u2122t care where they go to fight, so long it\u2122s against England. And this was against England. So it was funny. So we -- we organized it, and we had to be equipped, and then later the American government didn\u2122t allow it. They said we will not allow the equipped army to go, and it fell apart, so I st arted to work in the other organizations, and to go to Israel. And I was ready to go to Palestine in this time, and we send out in this time, people individual to ru -- to go to Marseille, and from Marseille, they dropped us to Palestine to fight. And one, it was on a Frid ay I remember, and it came -- my wife knew that I belonged there, but she didn\u2122t know exactly what . Friday I came, and I said, \ufb01Sunday morning, I am going. It\u2122s my turn to go,\ufb02 which I was very happy. So she was not angry, she said, \ufb01Well, it\u2122s your choice if you want to go. But one thing you should know, if you go, you have no way to come back. I will not wait for you, because I lost enough people my family, and I don\u2122t want to have somebody else to lose. And I know if you will go, you will be killed, or you will be wounded, and I don\u2122t want -- so, it\u2122s your -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 95 your choice to go.\ufb02 Well, we had the whole day to think about it. Sunday morning the group left, and I didn\u2122t go. And I was -- now, if people will ask me -- if people will ask me what is my biggest regret in life, there are a lot of things that I regret, but my biggest regret in life is that I didn\u2122t go to Palestine to fight. If I survived the war, and I didn\u2122t go to Palestine, this makes me somebody -- I don\u2122t want to say a traitor, but some -- this is my biggest regret. Because if somebody will tell me that I will have a choice, and a chance to be in Palestine for one day -- I think I told you this yesterday, if I will be -- have a choice to be in Palestine to fight for pa -- for a Jewish state one day, and the next day to be killed, I will always say that this would be my choice. Because if I could do it for Poland, which I was not a first class citizen, I should have done it for Palestine, and I didn\u2122t go. In 1939 -- in 1949, after we started to make a few dollars, my wife was a Hebrew teacher, and this time they send over a group of Hebrew teachers for courses to Jerusalem, which she didn\u2122t need it, but she went anyway. This was the first plane that went with visitors to Palestine. So we went, and we went to stay there. We went to settle there. The family [indecipherable] had a family, and they said, \ufb01You are in America, and Israel is very bad now.\ufb02 Peopl e didn\u2122t have work, didn\u2122t have what to eat. \ufb01So, if you come over, you -- you missed your chance, because there is no work. During the war we could use you. Now, you missed your chance, there is no war, so you better go to America, make money, send us the money.\ufb02 So we didn\u2122t stay there, but, I have to tell you one -- this was the first trip, we were in 1949. Since then, my wife and I, we were there 31 times, but I was more than 31 times, but I\u2122m say -- staying for the 31 times. The USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 96 -- th-the time in 20 -- in 1949, when I was a -- I met then a young fellow, his name is Lonna Guerrera. And he was in my unit, he was a captain in my unit, and then later he went to Palestine, and he was -- he fought there in the war. When am -- I met him in Jerusalem, he was a major, and he was very glad to see me, so he said, \ufb01I have to show you something.\ufb02 And he took me to a plac e in Jerusalem, you know, in this time Jerusalem was divided, and he took me to a place where there was a wall, and in the wall you could see new cinder blocks put in in a hole -- in the -- replaced. So he told me that -- that his group, they wanted to break through , and to go and to liberate the old part of Jerusalem, but they were not enough, and more than half were killed, and the rest came back, and he was one who was saved, and he showed me this. When he showed me this, I started to cry. And he ask me, \ufb01What are you crying?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Do you know why you didn\u2122t take it in this time? Because I wasn\u2122t here. Because I wasn\u2122t here, and for this reason [indecipherable].\ufb02 So he said, \ufb01What do you mean? We were about 80 people, and what would me -- make a difference if you would be here? You probably would be killed, too.\ufb02 Cause I always was the first one. I said, \ufb01No, it\u2122s not only me. Because if I would be here, and thousands like me, or two thousands like me, we would be able to take it. I wasn\u2122t here, 2,000 like me who survived were not here, and for this reason you couldn\u2122t take it.\ufb02 So I will never forget this -- this minute, when he showed me this. And I felt very -- I had very -- a big regret. Even America is very good for me, I have everything in America, there is not a thing that I cannot ha ve. But this was my place. If I survived the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 97 war, from the whole family, and if I -- in Israel, had a war of independence, and I wasn\u2122t there, this was wrong."

            "question": "Did you feel Jewish in a different way in Israel than in America? Your identity as a Jewish person?",
            "answer": "No, I didn\u2122t feel Jewish -- you see, you -- the different how you fe el Jewish. Now, you see, I was very religious home. I am not relig ious now. I am not religious, I don\u2122t know how far I believe, or disbelieve, I don\u2122t want to think about it, but I am not religious, why? Because, when I needed God, He wasn\u2122t there. Now, you ask a question why. See, I didn\u2122t make peace yet with God. When my n-nieces needed God, He wasn\u2122t there. But being a Jew, to me, is something else. Being a Jew -- I am proud of being a Jew, because we survived 4,000 years. People who were st ronger than the Jews, more than the Jews, they vanished. Who were on their own gro und, on the [indecipherable] place, they vanished. Jews were not on their places, they somehow survived. Jews were sa -- were tortured and killed for so many places, started with the Crusaders, with the Inquisition, with the Chminiski, with the pogroms, with all those things, finally with the Holocaust, they survived. So for me, being a Jew is something else; that we survived. And also, what we gave the world. We gave the world so much, more than any other people. The Germans gave the world a lot of things. They get artists, and players, and this and that. But they gave also a lot of misery. We Jews didn\u2122t give misery, we Jews contributed, and even til today, ta -- in every field, doctors, scientists, everything you -- singers, actors, Jews contribute, starting with the ancient times. The Jews contribute the 10 USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 98 commandments. No other people contribute d the 10 commandments. Now, if the God -- let\u2122s say you belo -- you believe in God. If God wanted to choose a family, and to bring like the Catholics say, to bring the son for the world, who did He pick out? He didn\u2122t pick out the Mexican family. He didn\u2122t pick out the Irish family, or a German family. He picked out a Jewish family, who were very religious. And they He picked out, and there was created a Jesus. I don\u2122t believe in it. I believe Jesus was a great man, but he was a man, that\u2122s all. He never dreamt about being a God. Because if you will tell Jesus when he was alive that he would be a God, he would probably commit suicide, cause he was a very good Jew. But God, let\u2122s say I\u2122m n-now saying from the sight of the non-Jews, if he create -- he w -- he picked out -- he picked out a Jew. Why? So the Jews gave the world a God. 2,000 years later, look, a billion people believed in him. Did they get a thanks for it? No. They didn\u2122t get a thanks, well you gave us a God. They killed the Jews for the God. Now, they say that Jews are Christ killers. Now, this is not true. I was interviewed two years ago, and there was a question about the Holocaust, then wha -- was a t-time that people ask questions, and one ma n asked the question, he said, \ufb01Isn\u2122t there -- isn\u2122t this a time to forget and forgive?\ufb02 So the man -- the moderator said he\u2122s going to answer it, I said no, this -- I answer this. So when I ask this man, I said, \ufb01Tell me, what nationality are you?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Polish.\ufb02 \ufb01What is your profession?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01A priest.\ufb02 So I said to him, \ufb01You asked, isn\u2122t it time to forget an d forgive?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01This happened 50 years ago.\ufb02 I said to him, \ufb01Do you know there wa s a nice Jewish young man 2,000 years ago, and he was killed, not by the Jews, he was killed. Did you forgot and forgive 2,000 years USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 99 later? Here, a million and a half childrens were killed, and you ask to forget and forgive?\ufb02 He hung up, he didn\u2122t answer. So, this what gives me, the Jews, in every respect, in everything, they contributed. They contributed in Germany. You had famous writers in Germany. Later, they were forbidden. You have famous composers in Germany. You have famous composers in Vienna. You have famous psychiatrists in Vienna, the first casa -- psychi -- Freud was in Vienna, and so on. Did the Jews get a thanks for it? No. What\u2122s wrong with Mendelsohn , what is wr-wrong with Lessing? What is -- one -- and now we start to -- to -- to -- to give all those a -- so this is -- and also, they were always held back, they never had a place to go ahead. Thank God in America they don\u2122t -- nobody holds them back. But th ey doing all the generations, they always were held back. But still somebody said, \ufb01Jews are like quicksilver.\ufb02 You know what quicksilver is?"

So majority, people who survived went to Palestine, later to Israel. And there are the children of the survivors, so there are the majority of the people who survived. So you didn\u2122t have the feeling that you are an outside r. And also, when I came to Israel -- when I already came to Israel, I came home. This was my home. When I came over here, and tha -- and we had an organization, and I gave a re port, how I experienced, how I liked Israel in this time. So I remember I told them, I said -- they -- they say -- I had a brother in is -- in Israel. Did you have a lot of friends, and how did they peer -- so I said, when I came to Israel, I had friends all over, all over ma -- I went over to the massada, I had a friends, the people who committed suicide, th e massad -- I lived with them. I -- when I went over to Teberius, I had friends. In Teberius, there is the rumbum. There i -- there is old sages that I lived with them, I was brought up rabmaya bel harnis, I don\u2122t know if you know there is a man that they called him the miracle man, he is buried in Teberius. I said, \ufb01I came to them, and those were my friends, because I was brought up with them.\ufb02 I was started USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 102 since I was three years about them. So you see, all those peopl e were with me. I went to Marron, I saw the people who created the caballah, the mystic. Those were my friends. So I came home to Israel, because they were there. It\u2122s the same thing like naturally, a Christian goes to Israel, and he walk, and he said, \ufb01I am walking the same road that Jesus walked.\ufb02 I went, and I walked the same day with -- the same road with Jesus, but not with the Jesus who mi -- was made a God hundred fift y years after his death. I walk with Jesus when he was a Jewish boy, a very religious Jewish boy. So I knew all those things. I walked with Mary, with the mother, that she was a Jewish mother, who lived in Nazareth.

I was on the right side of the fence. Not that I was a Communist. I never belonged to the Communist party. As a matter of fact, when I had a big position, the people who were above me always came, and they gave out ankettas, to write down to become a member of the Communist party. And they always gave me anketta, and each time the anketta had 25 questions more, always they add more. And every time I g -- I -- I reg -- received a -- you know the anketta is. When I received the anketta, and they said to fill it out to become a Communist party member. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 104 The reas -- the answer I s -- gave, I said, \ufb01I am not grown enough to be worthy to be a member of the Communist party.\ufb02 This was my a-answer, and this what they liked. I said, \ufb01I have to learn a little more about the Communist party, I want to give an answer.\ufb02 But I never believed, because to me, you see, I co me from a very Orthod ox family. I come from a rich family. Now, those two items were alien to Communism. And this was I had from my home. I give you another example -- you see, I always give you examples. When I was in Poland, I had dealings with Sa ppearha. Sappearha was the head of the co - of the Catholic church. He was the cardinal. As a matter of fact, the pope who is now pope, he was a prodigy of Sappearha. So I had some dealings with Sappearha. I looked on Sappearha, he was the head of the Catholic church, I looked with him, and I feel terrible. Why? The Communism regime -- Comm unist regime was against him. What did he want? He wanted to have his religion. When I looked on Sa ppearha, I didn\u2122t see Sappearha there, pol -- the Catholic cardinal. I saw my rabbi by which I studied. With -- til 17 years I studied in the Yeshiva, you know what a Yeshiva is? I saw my rabbi, the very Orthodox Hassidic Jew. I didn\u2122t see Sappearha, I saw my rabbi. Why? Because would he be alive in 1945, he would be treated the same as Sappearha is treated, because he will be -- he will represent a religion what the Communism was against, the same thing as the Catholic religion. So I saw my rabbi sitting there instead Sappearha. So for this reason, my feelings, when it came to Communism, was different, that mostly young people who embraced -- I never -- and also, my wife was always against this belief, why? Because she comes from a home, and if -- her home suffered very much. Her father lost USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 105 his job, they threw her out in the apartmen t, why? Because they were considered the bourgeoisie. They were afraid they will send them to Siberia. So you see, the difference is, from where -- would I come from a very, very poor home, that we suffered, or from a home that we never believed in religion, I would embrace Communism, because this would be my dream. I came from a different world. So even in this time, this was the regime, but my aim in this regime was one -- my purpose was only one thing, to take revenge. This was the only thing that I was ha ppy with. But I wasn\u2122t happy with -- with -- with all the other doctrines from -- from this regime. You understand?"

So when I came in, and the mother superior, they were Polish, and I thanked her, and I said I\u2122m glad to be -- in Polish, I said, \ufb01Koschulen mas -- matkabosska chanstahofsky.\ufb02 She said to me, \ufb01You know, since the church is a church, nobody said it correct, you are the first one who said it correct.\ufb02 So then I asked her, \ufb01What should I tell the people, should I tell them stories, the real stories, or should I make it a little nicer?\ufb02 She said, \ufb01No, tell them how it was.\ufb02 USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 109 Because I spoke -- I speak about Polish people worse than I speak about Germans, and I will tell you the reason why. So when I spoke, and I told them stories about the Polish people, so I thought, that\u2122s it, she will never invite me. About a month later, she calls me up, she said, \ufb01You know, we have a sister c hurch in Jersey City. Would you come out there to speak?\ufb02 So I thought it\u2122s not so bad. So -- now, the reason why I tell you what I s -- speak about Polish people more -- more against Polish people than the Germans. Nobody did so much harm as the Germans, because after all, they created the Holocaust, they did all the killings, they had all the ideas about extermination, about all those things. The Polish people collaborated in a different way. Now, when a German went into the SS, or to Einsatzgruppen, or became a Gestapo man, or killed just for pleasure, he was raised with the idea since he was in Hitler yugen, and he knew that Jew was worse than garbage, worse than a cockroach, that the Jew had to be eliminated. He was prepared for it. Even his parents sometimes didn\u2122t teach him, which the parents later taught him, too. But he was taught in school. The Polish stude nt was not taught to kill the Jews. The government didn\u2122t give out directives to kill the Jews. It came from within. When it came to a Jew, they knew they had to hate them. So, for this reas on, I have more -- not blame, I feel worse when I speak about Polish anti-Semitism as hit -- as Germans. Because nothing is worse than the Germans, because they did that, the wo rst thing, but each individual in Poland -- why did the Polish pe ople have to collaborate with the Germans where he was under German occupation. The Germans killed see -- three million Poles. The Poles were se -- garbage, s econd class citizen, undesirable, so -- so instead to have USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 110 two people -- somebody said to me, your enemy\u2122 s enemy is my best friend. Some -- if the -- i-if the -- if the Germans were Poles en emies, they should have -- have compassion with the Jews, who had the same problem, but they didn\u2122t. So for this reason I feel -- there were Poles who helped, very few, small percentage. People ask me -- I go and speak, they ask me, what percentage of Pole s would kill a Jew -- I\u2122m not talking about Germans, I\u2122m talking about Poles, what percentage of Poles would kill a Jew, what percentage wouldn\u2122t kill, but wouldn\u2122t help, and what per centage would help? And I was thinking about it a long time. I came to the conclusion 75 percent of the Poles would kill a Jew for no reason at all; giving out to the Germans, or kill them themselves. And don\u2122t forget, if a Pole gave out a Jew during the war, he got a kilo of sugar, or he -- he got a quart of kerosene. If he gave out five Jews, he got five kilo of sugar, imagine what a sweet life he had. 75 percent. 40 percent -- not 40 percent, 20 -- I said 23 percent -- 75 percent would give out, 23 percent wouldn\u2122t give out, they wouldn\u2122t help. They would say go away, I don\u2122t want to be involved, but they didn\u2122t give them out. We have nothing against those people; they didn\u2122t help us, but they didn\u2122t kill us. See, the pope was within the 23 percent. See, I know the pope very well. I was with the pope together eight months. It\u2122s a different story. We were very, very good friends. He called me Taddek, I called him Lolek, cause Karol is the nickname Lolek. And I used to meet him two times a week, and it\u2122s a different story, well. He, til today, he doesn\u2122t know that I am Jewish. He still knows that I am a Pole, but this a story besides this. So 24 -- 23 percent wouldn\u2122t USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 111 give out: like the pope, he\u2122s not a murderer, but he didn\u2122t help. Two percent helped Jews. So I read Ringenblume -- you know who Ringenblume --"

            "answer": "Well, so let me answer you. One percent will give out -- will help. So I said, who is smarter, I or Ringenblume? Naturally Ringenbl ume. A historian, a well known historian, and who am I? I am from a small town in Kolbushova. So I took my town as an example. We were 2,000 Jews, 2,000 Poles. If I would be right, that two percent Poles saved Jews, so it means my townspeople had to save 40 Jews. Two percent from 2,000, right? They didn\u2122t save 40 Jews. Now, Ringenblume will be right, one percent. So it means my town had to save 20 Jews. Did they save 20 Jews? No. Did they save 10 Jews? No, not even a half a percent. But to give them -- to -- to how you say benefit of the doubt, I say Ringenblume was right, one percent saved Jews . So this is why I say from where I came to this conclusion. I came with my town, and every town was the same. In a -- now, you will ask -- you asked me this before, before it\u2122s finished I want to -- to -- now I will tell you why I want to do it, and I\u2122 ll do it fast. My mother, as a hobby, used to make sweaters, for as -- she liked it. When there was not too much wool left, she made it very fast. And they ask her, why you rushing? She said, \ufb01I want to finish the sweater before I\u2122m out of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 112 wool.\ufb02 So the same thing, I want to finish it before we are out of time, we out of [indecipherable]. You ask me before about -- I told you that I sing a song, when I was interviewed -- when I was a moderator for this history. And the person, Ray Farr, ask me, \ufb01Why is there anti-Semitism in Poland so strong, stronger than the other countries?\ufb02 So I said, \ufb01I wouldn\u2122t answer you, but I will sing you a song, what I learned in school, a Catholic song, a church song.\ufb02 I re -- I rememb er this song, and the song has 12 stanzas. I wouldn\u2122t sing you -- for her I sing all the 12, for you I will only sing one. It\u2122s a beautiful song, a beautiful melody, I learned it in school . And this song is th at Jesus talks to his people, to the Jews. And the song is -- [sings] Lo do may lo do. Sool zamchi woochi nue, chemyap secrotchill, Eacham zaveenue, yachem visbolue zmotza farra oana, atish sheshoenju, shish namare ramyoana. And this is the song. People, my people, what did I do to you? With what did I trangress -- tr ansgress against you? I took you out from the bondage of p -- pharaoh, from Egypt. And what did you do to me? You put me on a cross. The second is people, my people, what did I do to you? I brought you in in a land with milk and honey. What did you do to me? You crucified me. Th e third one: people my people, what did I do to you? I elevated you among all other nations, and you elevated me on a cross. And so on and so on. Now, when we learned this song in school, and if a Polish boy learned this song, and he goes out, and he see a Jew with a beard, he goes to him, and he pulls his beard, kicks him, beats him, beats him, why? Cause they taught him -- what did they tell him? The Jews killed Jesus, which is not true. And this is what I told her, from there is the anti-Semitism. And I tell you a other story. Catholics -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 113 this is a story about the Puerto Rican. I ha d a house in Hoboken, and there were Puerto Ricans living there. The -- the janitor was a Puerto Rican. And once I came in, he had a boy about 10 years. He wa -- started to speak. So he ask me, \ufb01Hey, Mr. Norman, you Polacko, you Polacko?\ufb02 Because they called me Polacko. I said, \ufb01No, I\u2122m not a Polacko, I\u2122m a Hoodeo.\ufb02 I\u2122m a Jew. So the boy asked the father, and I understood what I understand, \ufb01What is a Jew?\ufb02 And the father gives him a whole less on. And I could hear he gives him a lesson, Jesus, and Jesus, and Jesus, and Jesus. He told him a story about Jesus. And after he finished th e stories -- the story, the boy goes and pulls my sleeve, and he says, \ufb01Hey, Mr. Norman, why did you kill Jesus?\ufb02 Because the father told him a story. So he asked me why did I kill -- why I killed Jesus. So those are the stories about antiSemitism. When I was a peddler, I came in, and always my customers lived on the fifth floor, they never lived on the second -- on the first floor, because I had to go up, no elevator. So I ask him why somebody should live on the first floor. And I dragged my suitcases on the fifth floor. So I come in once, and the door was open, there was a young woman, she was born in America, she must be about 26 years. And the door was open, and I hear that she yells -- the child was crying, and she yells to the child, \ufb01Be quiet, because the Jew will come with the sack, and he will take you away.\ufb02 This happened in Jersey City. And then she turns around, she sees me. She was a little embarrassed. I asked her, \ufb01Tell me, why did you tell the stig -- th-the girl that the Jew w ill come with the sack and take you away? Did you ever see a Jew comes with a sack and takes away a child?\ufb02 She says, \ufb01Why, I don\u2122t know, but my mother always used to tell it to me, and I was USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 114 always so afraid I stopped crying.\ufb02 The mother told it to her, she telled it to the child, and the child will probably tell it to her child. And this is from where the hate, the antiSemitism comes. Cause children are not born bad."

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 115 They want to go in to see it. But the Jew knows it already. So every time I think it will get weaker, and weaker. We are farther, farther away. Take for instance the Inquisition. You know the story about the Inquisition., huh? How many people speak about the Inquisition? And the Inquisition was a terrible thing. How many people speak about the Crusaders? Do you know that in Crusaders, 400 Jewish towns were destroyed? 400. And this time in Poland, in Poland were 400,000 Jews. During the time of the Crusaders, from the 400,000, 200,000 Jews were killed. Nobody knows. 50 percent. Nobody knows about it."

For me, it didn\u2122t even scratch the surface. It showed a lot of things, but what we went th rough, it didn\u2122t show you w -- that -- th-the real misery. But for the American, it showed enough. One thing I liked about \ufb01Schindler\u2122s List,\ufb02 and the Polish people don\u2122t like it, is there is one scene when the Jews were taken to the Krak\u00f3w ghetto, and when they were chased away, and they were killed, and isn\u2122t it -- there was a Polish girl staying there, a blond girl, and she said, \ufb01Goodbye Jews, goodbye Jews.\ufb02 It is typical, but the Polish people didn\u2122t like it. Then a other thing they didn\u2122t like that in Auschwitz, a lot of kapos spoke Polish; they were Polish girl. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 116 Because if a Polish girl was taken to Auschwitz, she got a good job. For instance, from my town, there is a girl Zoshka Vinyarska Esertanay.

The only one who saved Jews, the only one who took in and there -- Keeto took in in his ga -- in his underground Jew -- any Jew who wa nted to go in. The next in -- in command USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 120 was a Jewish general, Pattie, I think was his name. He was a Jew. In the Polish underground you didn\u2122t accept a Jew.

So now, America wants to show they are stronger than Serbia. Well, how -- to take the American army, the air force, and to destroy Serbia? For what? Because the alb -- the -- the -- the Albanese, they had in their constitution, they had, not in constitu -- in their rules, they had that every mon -- every week, they have to kill three Serbian policemen. Every week they kill a -- so they started it, they wanted to have a independence. They ha -- had the undergroun d against Serbia. So what should Serbia say? Wait -- I will sit and wait til they kill us? So howa -- Serbia an-answered. And I don\u2122t say that Milosevich was an angel, but the Serbian people didn\u2122t deserve it. And what did they do? Not only the Serbian, they killed the Kosovian, too, because they bombed kos -- Kosovo. They bombed -- they de stroyed everything what they had, the people with the electricity, and bridges, and everything. So I think that you cannot compare it with -- with any other.

I would like to know whether you can pinpoint, at least to some degree, the time when you felt comfortable with your identity as an American. And what did that mean to you?",
            "answer": "Well, I think that I felt right away very glad that I\u2122m in America, the minute I came. Naturally, in the beginning, I was very unhap py. I was glad that I\u2122m in America, but I was very unhappy, and as a matter of fact, the first year, probably, I went around with ma -- in my mind to commit suicide, for a few reasons. The first thing, I looked around, and I didn\u2122t have my family. And I expected to ha ve a family here, a new family, but I didn\u2122t have it. And then, it is very -- I know people who had this experience, maybe they will understand; you know, it is like you are on a very, big, beautiful horse, and you fall down from the horse. I was already in Poland, after the war, I have a high position, I had -- I was established, I -- I ruled -- not ruled, but I -- I could do a lot of things, and people respected me, and here I came over, and I was nothing. In America, later I find out, you could be smart, you could be intelligent, you could do -- be a lot of things, but if you didn\u2122t have money, you have -- you are noth ing. And I didn\u2122t have money, and these things that -- what I did in Poland, and what I was in Poland, meant nothing There were a lot of people who, they were thankful, I did a lot of things for them in Poland, but when I came here, everything disappeared. So, of co urse it was such a vacuum. I came down from -- from a high position, to nothing, and I was very disappointed. And I didn\u2122t know USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 123 what will be the future, what I will do. Like I mentioned before, I didn\u2122t have a trade, I didn\u2122t have money, and I didn\u2122t know what to do. So I was very -- then -- then the -- the - the story with Israel this appears, that I didn\u2122t go to Israel, which I wanted. And -- so I ask my -- question myself, I said, so what\u2122s now? So a lot of times I went around with ideas that I probably -- the best thing is that I should commit suicide, and the thing is a lot of times when I went in the car, and I start to think it will better when I wouldn\u2122t come home alive. It\u2122s very sad that I was thinking about it then, but this -- this was the reality."

And if you are interested, I can explain to you, I can show it to you. And so, if I have guests, like for instance Saturdays we don\u2122t make th e observance like it should be, but if I have guests for this, I do it. See, I know how to do it, [indecipherable] because like I said, til 17 years I started, and I don\u2122t know if you\u2122ll say to be a rabbi, or to what, but I -- we were very, very in-involved in it. So -- but now, after the war, n -- everything what has to do with the connection, with -- with the -- with the God, we let it go a little bit, because we each were asking a question, and we don\u2122t have answers. My daughter for USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 129 instance -- and my daughter is more observant than we are. And -- like for instance, every Friday night, and -- she lights the candles, and her children come, and everyone has to wear a kippah, and then they say the blessings, and they sing what th ey have to do. Also because they go to So lomon Shechter, which is a religi ous Jew telly school, and they go partly to Solomon Shechter, because I pay for it. And I said to them if they will go to Solomon Shechter, I would pay, and this is quite expensive, because -- because it cost almost 10,000 dollars a year for each one. Now, her husband, for instance, comes from a house that they didn\u2122t know too much about Judaism. Now, her husband\u2122s parents, like for instance his father\u2122s siblings, they all married por -- Protestants. His mother\u2122s ma -- family married Catholics. So -- but none of them married Jews -- well, one maybe married Jews. So her husband, because he was a fraid that with them the Jewish tradition, everything would get lost, so he became more Jewish. And he did it himself, he asked for it, and as a matter of fact, in his sophomore year he went to Israel, and he went for a year to Israel, but he didn\u2122t go on the English facu lty -- English part, but the Hebrew. And he speaks perfect Hebrew. He ri -- and he gets all the Hebrew newspapers, and he\u2122s very much involved with Israel. The oldest son, til he was three years, he spoke to him only Hebrew, because he -- he thought English he would learn anyway. So they are very much -- they belong to a temple, and with the children they go to temple. Now, for instance, the Israeli government sends over certain people, a nd -- for a year to be on Harvard, or in MIT. So there are certain families that they adopt a family for a year, so they adopt every year a family. And they stay with them Saturdays, holidays, because it\u2122s ver -- and they USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 130 were a few times, like for instance the oldest boy went yest erday to Israel, and he\u2122s 16 and a half, and there is a group.

            "question": "Well, two -- two -- two follow up questions. One is, what -- how do you evaluate the impact that survivor testimonies and recollections like yours have had on the collective Holocaust memory in this country, if you will?",
            "answer": "I think this is very important, becaus e the survivors co -- testimonies is more important than even reading a book. Because, you see like for instance, I was not long ago I was in the -- to speak in a -- in -- in a school, and there was -- it wasn\u2122t -- there were not Jewish students, there were mostly Christians. So the -- who -- with they -- the teacher, when they introduce, they said, \ufb01You -- we -- I want we should see this man, because in a few years, you\u2122ll be able to say, I saw a survivor, because then there will not be survivors. So you saw the survivor, and y ou heard it from a survivo r.\ufb02 So this is very important when you go to schools, and then -- when you did -- it\u2122s also depends how you tell the story. Now, when I go -- so I ask always how old the children are, if they are -- what nationality they are, wh-what a -- what ethnic background. It\u2122s very important because you have to tell them stor -- different stories. Now in -- how old, and how many -- and I never prepare a speech. When I prepare a speech, it\u2122s a fiasco. I have to come and look at the faces, and then I speak. As you can see, I cannot -- I cannot read a speech. Now, not long ago I was in Elizabeth, and this was three high schools put together, and there were about -- I would say about 250 st udents, not one White, all of them Black. And it was a different experience. And I to ld them, and naturally I compared the Holocaust with -- with the life of the Black people in America. Se -- so you have to cater USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 136 to each one different. So for this reason I ask what nationality, what -- not so much nationality, what religion and -- and age, and it\u2122s so you --"

            "answer": "Yes, they are very interested. It\u2122s also depends how you tell the story, because I went to some -- to some -- somebody spoke, and because we were two, and when the other person spoke, so the teach -- the students were talking to each other, they didn\u2122t have no interest, because -- I didn\u2122t blame them, because the way the person talked, it was very monotonous, and -- and then later when I spoke, they had a different interest. I was in a school, and they had about 400 ch ildren, so then the principal came to me, he said, \ufb01I can tell you only one thing. This is the first time th at they were sitting for two hours, and they listened. And they -- I could never keep th em for so long, and they should have a interest.\ufb02 Again, I see what the children -- what interest it is. Now, if you go, and you see la -- when I speak to a Jewish group, and when the Jewish group is let\u2122s say between 16 and seven -- 15 and 17 years, I don\u2122t tell them stories about the death camps. They have no interest about the death camps. They want to know what did the Jews do. How did they protect themselves. So then I tell them stories about my activity in the underground, in the woods. This what they want to know. They want to know if I did something, if I killed somebody, if I -- this -- this what they into, they\u2122re not interested in Auschwitz. They are not interested se -- in the -- in the ovens, and the cruelty, what the Germans did. This is ha -- no. They -- the same thing in Israel, and I spoke in Israel, the children are interested what did the Jew do. And if you tell them a story from a underground, from a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 137 resistance, from this, this what they associate, and this what they like to hea r. So for this reason you have to fa -- you ha ve to face the people, and to see what they have -- what interest they have."

            "question": "This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Norman Salsitz. This is tape number five, side B.",
            "answer": "So we spoke about -- about [indecipherable] didn\u2122t know too much. And then -- now the Warsaw uprise, this is the main thing, which was a very important thing, because they didn\u2122t fight to win a war, because this wasn\u2122t how -- because they knew that they would be killed. This was only for a fight to pay back a little bit, to take revenge. Not to go and be killed without killing somebody else, and also to show that there are -- there is some resistance. This is for the honor of the Jews, for the honor of the Jewish flag. And there were other camps that they were resistance, bu t people don\u2122t know about it, it -- very few. Like for instance, there is a film, I -- probably you saw it, is the, \ufb01Escape from Sobib\u00f3r.\ufb02 Did you see this? It\u2122s a very powerful vide o, and -- and how they tried to save m -- unfortunately from the people who escaped, they all practically were killed by the Poles, very few survived. As a matter of fact, the man who was the leader, his name was Friedlander, he was the leader and the organizer of this revolt, he -- after he escaped, he somehow survived, and he went back to his sm all town, he opened a small store, and six months later he was killed by the natives, by his friends, after he went out from Sobib\u00f3r. So this is a very -- it\u2122s a big tragedy that even the people who did something, they were s -- they were killed later. Now, I have friends who were in the resistance in different places, but after the war, they were killed. Now -- now, take for instance, Treblinka, it was the most horrible camp, because Treblinka was not con -- con -- was not converted from a labor camp. This was built as a death camp, and they -- everything was done there USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 139 for the death camp. It was very terrible. 700,000 people were killed there. And when you say 700,000 dollars, I say it so fast, like -- lik e -- like we will count 700 dollars. So the -- an -- and from Treblinka they had also revolt and escape. From the escape on -- 600 escape, and how they escaped. Not from the people who had to be killed, from the people who were the permanent prisoners, who did the undressing, taking out the gold from the teeth, and from the 600, 40 survived from the -- from the 600, cause on the -- fr -- through the time they were killed. There is even a story that a Polish group, two Polish people found 12 people from Treblinka hiding in the woods, and they killed them. And when after -- after the war, somebody denounced them, and they were taken to court, and they got -- those two got three years jail for killing the 12 people. And after three years, they were -- came out, and imagine, for killing 12 people who escaped from Treblinka, they got three years. After they escaped, and they -- they were living in Poland, and later when the government changed, it wasn\u2122t any more a Communist government, in 1989, when -- after Lech Walesa, when they had the solidarity. So the people sued the government that they were arrested in -- and they -- and they were in jail three years. And the reason why they sued the government, they said they killed Jewish Bolshevik bandits. The people were Jewish Bolshevik band its. Now, the people escaped from Sobib\u00f3r, they\u2122re hide -- they were hidden -- them -- they hid themselves in the woods. So they said that they were Jewish Bolshevik bandits, and the reason they killed them is because they were good Polish patriots, and they wanted to kill the Bolshevik bandits. And this what they -- when they ki -- they say -- they sued the government. So th -- so one got in -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 140 from the government, they gave him something, 400 million zlotas, which it was not millions, it came out to about 40,000 dollars compensation because they were three years in jail. Because they say tha -- this what -- they killed the Jews doesn\u2122t mean anything, but they say they killed Jewish Bolshevik bandits. And -- so th -- after this, when they got this in court, so about 300 Poles who were arrested for killing Jews, all of them started to sue the government, that they say that we killed Jewish Bolshevik bandits. And it\u2122s a very unfair. Now, I got -- when -- when I\u2122m prepare -- I\u2122m preparing now the new book, so I got a order from Bukonroffsky. Bukonroffsky was the head of the Polish underground in Poland, from the AK, General Bukonroffsky. So I got a order from Bukonroffsky, from September 1943, that he gave a order to all Polish AK members, that they should go out in the woods, and to find the Jewish Bolshevik bandits, and to kill them. And this is when, about three months later, when I appr oached my friend, he should take in my group, into his group, and then when they shot me, probably this was on account of the order that they have to kill all -- and also the order said, first you have to kill the commandant, and once the commandant will be killed, it will be easy to kill the rest of the group. So for this reason, probably, they got -- wanted to get rid of me, and then later they would kill the rest of us. So I got from England, I got the original order, the date, the number, because tho -- this is in the archives of this Polish underground, which is still in London."

            "answer": "He was the previous director, and he sp oke to me, naturally he didn\u2122t take on my work, but he ask me what I think about it, we are very good friends. So he wanted -- he wa -- took this job, because he wanted it sh ould be a Jewish museum. It should be -- it -- the Holocaust shouldn\u2122t be watered down. Because there was a case that the -- some other nationalities or other ethnic groups came in, and they said well, we had a Holocaust. Holocaust was for the Jews. The Polish people say Polish Holo caust. Poland didn\u2122t have a Holocaust, because by Jews, every Jew had to be killed. No -- in -- in Poland, if you did something wrong, they arrested you. If you we re in the underground, they caught you with weapons, they caught you with black mart -- mark -- market, so they arrested you. And wi -- and if they arrested you, it doesn\u2122t me an that the whole family had to be killed. By Jews is -- they\u2122re like Elie Wiesel said, not all victims were Jews, but all Jews were USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 142 victims. So -- so he wanted to keep it as a Jewish museum , and -- and -- and now, when he is on -- now that he received the best proof, he was pushed out because he didn\u2122t want Arafat should come as a Head of State. First thing, Arafat was not a Head of State, and th -- he said if Arafat was not such a Jew lover, and if he wanted to s -- that they said to learn about the Holocaust, he had Yad Vashem right under his nose. And he knew very well what the Holocaust is, because if Arafat will come as a Head of State, they had to close the museum, and give him the VIP treatm ent, and he was against it. And for this reason he was fired. So he -- I am afraid that this will be watered down, that the Holocaust, the Jewish Holocaust will be watered down, because other people will came -- come in. Like there was once in -- in a -- what was it, not a -- no, Croatia wanted to make a -- make something about the Holocaust, and Croatia was -- they were the worst murderers in -- in the world. They had the Oestasha, the Oestasha killed thousands and thousands of Serbs, thousand an d thousands of -- of Jews, and now they are the victims, the victims of the Holocaust. Now, they were collaborators with Germany. They were not occupied by Germany, they were collaborators, it was never occupied by Germany. So this -- so I think that the Holocaust museum will be watered down, because it will not be strict that it\u2122s a Jewish Holocaust, where Yad Vashem is only a Jewish Holocaust, because they don\u2122t have other ethnic groups to be Yad Vashem, and to do -- to say, well, this was my Holocaust. And -- so it\u2122s a big difference. Now you have a other -- a -- a memorial museum in -- in New York. Now this is a new story, because this is a Holocaust museum, but it has three tiers. The first one when you go in , this -- they show USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 143 you the book -- the -- the life of Jews from before the war. And if you go in, you will see there\u2122s some of my pictures there. Then you have -- you ha ve the -- the second floor is the Holocaust, and the third floor is how the Jews picked up their life after the Holocaust. It\u2122s a whole different -- it\u2122s a -- it\u2122s a all different story. But in Washington, I am afraid that the -- that the people who are now in charge, they will water down the Jewish Holocaust, and they -- they are artifacts, I gave them a lot of artifacts there what they have. But they arti -- and this was the reason that Dr. Royach was pushed out, because he wanted it should be a Jewish Holocaust museum, wa -- that the Holocaust was only Jewish."

            "answer": "Well, to be -- which is important that -- l ook, we can talk and talk, there is a lot of things important, but, about the Holocaust I think the most important thing is, is not to forget that there was a Holo caust. Because we cannot have the six million people die in vain. And in vain I mean they die, and there will be no remembrance, and there will not be no -- ho-how should I say it? That the peop le should not cry after them, because they died for no reason at all. That we should talk about them. So this is very important. And -- and the boo -- all the books, every book which is written, from every Holocaust, if the book is good, if the book is bad. Some are better, some are not so good, but everybody has to tell a story, and it\u2122s -- I encourage always when people say well, I want to write a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 144 book, I encourage them, and if I can help them in any way, I do.

So naturally some book are not so important, they are not -- but still, it\u2122s an important thing, because this is written by a survivor, and if he survived, it is important. [clock chiming]. Well, so this is -- this is mostly what, you know, so the children should be -- they should be taught -- they should be rem-reminded, and they should be told about the Holocaust. Because, if the children of my sisters, who were three and a half, four, five years old, if they will know that 50 years later, somebody will speak about them, maybe their life, their death wouldn\u2122t be so horrible. There will say somebody will remember me 50 years later. But if -- and also, I want -- now I have my -- I have my pictures that I saved, 500 photos.

It\u2122s the same thing, I don\u2122t want that the pers on who lived, and the Holocaust killed them, the people were killed, and they disappeared, and the name was never mentioned. Because he was a human being, he was alive, he had dreams . He wanted to live, and to have a future, to have children, have grandc hildren. But he was wiped out. So I want this person, should USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 145 be written down that there was a man who lived. I have his picture. And then the pictures should see this is how he looked. This what I want, and this what my dream is, to have an album with everybody\u2122s picture, it should be recorded that there was once a man like this, and he was destroyed.

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 147",

Now, if I speak about something, and if I want to say somethi ng from my hometown, Kolbushova, I alway -- I call it home. I am -- I was there 22 years, but I am in the United States 50 years, more than double, but still this -- even America is de ar to me, and I think -- I think the best -- biggest patriots America had -- has, are people -- newcomers, because we appreciate America. Some people who are born in Amer ica, they don\u2122t appreciate America. We appreciate. And then, if -- if -- so I love America, but still, when I say home, I have my little town, this is my home. Taddek was when I survived, and to be -- why did I survive? I fought back. I didn\u2122t survive because I was standing there with my hands down when I was laying on the floor, shot four times. And if I wouldn\u2122t be able to grab my revolver, and to kill them, I wouldn\u2122t be alive, because they were -- today I got a letter from one of the people from my town in -- a very nasty letter, a very anti-Semitic letter. She is the head of the culture and history department. She was a professor in university. A very anti-Semitic letter. And I answered her also a very strong letter. And then later she wrote to me, which I never answered, she said, \ufb01Well, I didn\u2122t,\ufb02 -- I accused her of being antiSemitic, she said, \ufb01But I didn\u2122t kill nobody, but you are a murderer.\ufb02 Why am I murderer?

When it comes to Norman Salsitz, Norman Salsitz is all of those things. Now, I am USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 148 living, I am in a free country, I can do anything I want. I never had anything bad from the government in the United States. They never did anything wrong to me, and I can speak up. If something is wrong, I open my mouth. I have -- I have stories here is that something happens in -- in -- in Hoboken, something happens there, but I always spoke up, and I always could yell, and I always co uld say what I want. Nobody said be -- be quiet because you are a Jew. Nobody yet. There were some people who have anti-Semitic remarks, but nobody yet told me [indecipherable], nobody kicked me because I am a Jew. And this is what America is. I can be what I am, and I am not afraid that somebody will say you cannot be this, you cannot be this because you somebody different.

You should be on the watch, if some skinhead, or somebody comes to you, and will -- he will tell you a story that this Black is not good, that this Oriental is not good, this Jew is not good. You should always answer, and you should always stay on guard, and then, we will not have a Holocaust in America. But if nobody will say it, who knows? There will be enou -- enough people, they will get bigger and bigger, and we could have prob lems. So this the people -- the children understand. But being in America I think is a privilege, and the privilege is because I can be anything I want. I can be -- so long as I\u2122m not against the law. The only thing I cannot be is a president, because I was not born here. But otherwise, I can be anything [indecipherable] capable, I can do it. Nobody can stop me.

Where we, being in Poland for thousand years -- see, I always -- I always was a Polish Jew. And this what I was hurt. I wanted to be a Jewish Pole. Being a Jewish Pole it means I could be a Jew Protestant, I could be a Jew Christian, a Jew cat -- a -- a -- a Jew Catholic, but I wanted to be a Jewish Pole, but no, I was a Polish Jew. And this is a big difference between a Polish Jew, and a Jewish Pole. And this what I could never achieve in Poland. Like take for instance, in Italy. In Italy the Jews were treated very well, and 80 percent of Jews in ta -- in Italy survived. There were not too many Jews in Italy, but as many there were, 80 percent survived. Now you will ask, Mussolini was a partner with Hitler. Why? Because the Italian people said, \ufb01We don\u2122t have Jews. We have Italians with a different religion.\ufb02 This what they approved the Jew, a different religion. And th -- and again, later, when they had undergrounds, so th ey asked th-the Italians from the underground, they said, \ufb01Why do you go and help the Jews?\ufb02 They said, \ufb01When we on the underground, we fight against Hitler. Everything what Hitler says, we are opposite. He says to kill the Jew, so we save them.\ufb02 But in Poland, was different. In Poland, when he said to kill the Jews, they said -- my wife had a boyfriend, he loved her, and he was everything. He said, \ufb01I hate the Germans, what they do with Poland, but one thing I have to admire and thank them, that they got rid of the Jews for us.\ufb02 And he was a Polish patriot. But this was very important, he got rid of the Jews. So this is the different America -- I say America is my country. See, when it comes the Fourth of July, I hang out a flag. I am the only one on the street to hang out the flag. And the reason why I hang out the flag, because in Poland, if I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 150 didn\u2122t hang out the flag, the police came, gave me a fine. Here, nobody gets fined by the police, and because they don\u2122t force me, I want to hang out a flag, because I think this is very important for me."
