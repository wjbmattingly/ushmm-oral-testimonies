That was the Sudetenland where she grew up and her father was as she said a notar, which was notary which is very unusual for a Jewish man. And they were secular too."

And my father probably went, I\u2019m saying probably, university in London because he was in London for some time.

            "question": "How did your parents meet?",
            "answer": "I think they met at Karly Vary, Karlsbad in German and it was a place where people went to summer and as a matter of fact I found the actual ballroom where they met and first danced with each other and as my mother said. I mean he was quite short and quite fat but my mother said he could dance a mean tango. So and he was very kind of Prussian. He was not known for his charm, although he could be very funny. And my mother was very beautiful and very charming and after they met they were both invited to a dinner party where the subject of Hitler came up. And the Czechs in the Sudetenland were saying oh it\u2019s nothing. Don\u2019t worry and my father who got, he had a big, bad temper. He got outraged and he called them all chicken headed. And but no one believed him and so he stormed out. But the next day he was at my mother\u2019s apartment at that time. She was probably working in some kind of dress shop boutique in Prague, with a dozen long stemmed roses. And I think you know she later said that why she married him. She had many suitors was because she felt like he was rock solid. That she could rely on him and indeed his paranoia saved her and her own parents wouldn\u2019t leave. Her father said since he didn\u2019t speak English, what would I do, sell sausages in a foreign land. So his, and her brother, my uncle Paul Brennan, is the story stayed behind to take care of them. And that\u2019s how they met.  https://collections.ushmm.org  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Barbara Goldberg 5 August 22, 2012"

And then they came back to Paris and then when they left Paris, along with all the others, my -- you had to wait in line for a visa and everything like that. And so that took a while, even to get out of Paris. But then I think I wrote you that \u2014 so I think 1s that they followed a lot of people who were there who were driving south and trying to get to Spain and then Portugal. And in, I believe, it was Bordeaux there was Aristide de Sousa Mendes who arranged for them I think along with something like 30 or 33,000 other people to get \u2014"

And my mother said well you know Santa Barbara, Santa Monica. And it really wasn\u2019t until I was 20 that I knew her mother\u2019s first name which was Blanca so they didn\u2019t talk about it. And I also found out that there was a letter written to my father\u2019s uncle in Australia that I saw a copy of years later through my Australian cousins. And it went -- sorry to hear of Max\u2019s death. Agusta who was, they were brother and sister, is grieving. I thought I didn\u2019t know she was grieving about. So it turns out there were seven brothers and sisters on my, of my grandmother. And there was a short period of time where you could buy people out of Germany. And so he and a cousin in London you know raised some money and got a lot of them out. So I know, to South Africa and Israel, Palestine then. And Australia. But I didn\u2019t know about that until so much later. And I remember the text of the letter because it said Monica is so smart et cetera, et cetera. There was hardly a word about me.

So my parents weren\u2019t exactly communicative, but I think I knew this story before he actually did start talking about it which was when he was older and my younger son was getting bar mitzvahed so he was starting to talk and he, I remember my uncle as being a great ping pong player. And young and kind of dashing and very funny. He told jokes all the time."

His father had already died in the boxcar. From Prague to Theresienstadt. And I think he saw his mother die but long story short, he was greeted at the train by Mengele in his white uniform. Just the way they say. This is what he told me. And he was going to the right, to the left, to the right, to the left. And the man ahead of him said you know I\u2019m a good worker. My back hurts me a little bit but I can certainly hurt to the left or however it was to the left. And my uncle got off and he said I\u2019m young, I\u2019m strong and I know how to weld. To the right. How he learned how to weld is another story. But another cousin of ours, also a survivor who recently died was a violinist and his father, I don\u2019t know, had taught them both to weld. So anyway, he survived and then was sent to I don\u2019t know if he was sent to another camp like Dachau, before Friedlander. I mean my cousin, other one was in every camp you can imagine. So."

Or getting out. And this same man said look what these shoes have done to my feet. You like them so much, you wear them. And he took them off and he threw them at my uncle. Because I guess the shoes didn\u2019t exactly fit. So I remember that story. And it must have been horrible for him to know about his mother. So I don\u2019t know how they actually, my uncle got in touch with, or my father actually got in touch with him. I remember in my early days there were all these phone calls, all these phone calls going on all the time, trying to locate people. And then there was always Vita Gutmacher [ph], so there was a lawyer, accountant or whatever in Forest Hills, Hans Lexa and I think he dealt with all the people who were putting in claims. And you know legal claims. And I don\u2019t think my parents or my grandmother ever got any, Vita Gutmacher. But from what I understand its property, not people.

She was having trouble sleeping and because for many years when I was first born, she didn\u2019t know whether her own parents were alive or dead. And you know she had her own fears which I think were exaggerated because of the situation. And my father\u2019s paranoia was certainly exaggerate \u2014 well maybe not. Maybe he would have been like that anyway. So he said you know I\u2019ve written a lot about this. I\u2019ve written a lot of this material in two books of poetry that talk about this exactly how he kept saying, never invest in real estate. It\u2019s not liquid. And the one illegal thing he did was keeping a bar of gold under his pillow. It\u2019s not allowed, at least at that time. To keep gold because you couldn\u2019t, it wasn\u2019t liquid. You couldn\u2019t make a getaway. And that mentality of making a getaway  https://collections.ushmm.org  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Barbara Goldberg 16 August 22, 2012 is something that I grew up with. Also these are just little things that are sort of interesting. He never believed in showing exactly what you have. So our house in Forest Hills. It was outside the gardens, which were the Forest Hills garden which were segregated. No Jews, no blacks, no anything. You know it looked like a decent house but you would never know what it looked like inside. And there was this snobbery but I imagine that preexisted the war. With the Eastern European Jews. And it would \u2014 the two communities Forest Hills and Kew Gardens were in their own way segregated. With the, as I said the Hungarians and the Czechs and the Germans and the Austrians and all that in Forest Hills. And the Poles and the Russians and the, you know the rest over there in Kew Gardens. So there was only German spoken in my house. I don\u2019t think we had an American. I mean I don\u2019t know if it was on purpose but they didn\u2019t have any, they had American acquaintances but they never came to the house or I don\u2019t know if they went there or not. So it was a fairly closed society which they called De Ganse Circus [ph], which is the whole circus because it was so, the morality and the ethics and all that were so different from 1950s American Ozzie and Harriet. I mean there were love affairs and divorces and you know and parties and lots of a big social life, even during the week, as I call it a school night. But that was the life there. I know that my father loaned money to a lot of people. And helped a lot of people out which you would think would not quite be like his character but he did. And he always said this country\u2019s been very good to us. You have to pay all your taxes and you have to this, you know. He was very black and white. So."

She always said life is sad enough. Of course I love sad movies. I had to grow up opposite. My father died when I was 14 and he left an extremely complicated will. I mean you had to admire the way he was thinking it through. Like ok, at 21 and we were 14. Up until the age of 21 you know whatever my mother you know but when we were 21 we came into money. Then when we were 28. So 21 we might be married. 28 we might be divorced. And 35 we might be buying a house with a second husband. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure this was the way he was thinking. So very -- you know that we would be taken care of. And in terms of being taken care of, that was how he showed his love. I don\u2019t remember one hug. And my sister, I think he felt closer to her for many reasons. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t know if he hugged her either. But she was more apparently or supposedly, more mathematically minded and her personality was totally different. I was a lot, I mean I just was like mercury. I was all over the place. And I kind of always had the feeling he could deal with her easier, and I was like my mother, more exaggerated. But he did hit us, me in particular because I was fresh. The reason I was fresh is cause I was proud and I didn\u2019t even know I was fresh when I was being fresh. So but again it\u2019s hard to say whether that would have been the case anyhow."

Like I never imagine things are going to  https://collections.ushmm.org  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Barbara Goldberg 21 August 22, 2012 turn out for the better.

But I\u2019ve never been observant. So and I\u2019m very -- I\u2019m trying to think of the books I\u2019ve chosen. Well when I was in the Rockville JCC I may have chosen some books that were supposed to be by women authors where this was the subject.

I felt a terrific burden even though I always felt really strongly that I didn\u2019t want to burden my children. And so I talked very little about it myself, about the Holocaust and all the experiences. I think when they got older I started to a little more because I feel probably how my parents felt, very protection. I mean how do you grow up with this? I don\u2019t know what young children do with this kind of information. I mean they should know about it, but when. That\u2019s you know one of my main concerns. So in terms of my grandchildren. In terms of my grandchildren. I want them to know that it happened and there\u2019s a written record of it happening. And I just can\u2019t expect them to feel as connected to it as I do but on the other hand if they\u2019re connected to me they will be connected to it. So it\u2019s a big world out there. I think that you know they should know what they want to know about it and kind of stretch a little. I mean my oldest granddaughter is starting kindergarten in a few days. Do I want her to know that there are people out there who do these kind of things? I remember in terms of when I found out about my cousin who had these medical experiments. I didn\u2019t want to, I mean I guess I didn\u2019t want to picture it all but somehow so that a lot of my \u2014 like my mother maybe has just been pushing the imagery away.

Maybe I\u2019d be there anyway but I really feel this earth has come it\u2019s very close to the end of its life span. It\u2019s not funny and you know I worry for my grandkids in that way because human nature is human nature. I remember once I was being interviewed and my interviewer who was black said do you feel like the Jews were specially singled out or whatever. And I said look it\u2019s an accident of fate. It could have been anything. It\u2019s an accident of fate that I\u2019m born Jewish. It\u2019s an accident of fate that Hitler went after the Jews.

I mean look I don\u2019t feel that way, but I just I just feel that life is \u2014 you\u2019re vulnerable and the best thing to do sometimes is to deny although I would have been scandalized by my saying that in my flagrant youth. But yeah cause otherwise how could you live? But I try. And to be remotely cheerful and good natured which was my livelihood when I was younger. I mean that\u2019s how I made it through all this. I do remember when I went to my stepfather who was a doctor. I was around 18 or 19. I said I\u2019m very depressed. And he went -- you, depressed?

In the summer when the days were light longer, we piled in the car and drive down Metropolitan Avenue for soft ice cream at Carvel\u2019s. Those nights we could have been a regular American family out for spin whose father maybe tossed a ball with his kids. Or tousled their hair or let himself be tickled, but we knew his moods would return when we\u2019d tip toe around the house, lay low. This was the 50s. There was Korea but it was far away and it wasn\u2019t our war. And they weren\u2019t murdering our people. Later I\u2019ve learned but only much later after he was long gone, that he gave our blue Persian carpet to Franz Smetana who was broke and could sell it for cash. He also gave money to his mother\u2019s seven brothers and sisters. And some got out in time, dispersing to Israel, Australia, South Africa. Or the year he paid the bills for the Swiss sanitarrum my uncle stayed at after the war to put on fat. These kindnesses, these things my father did without thinking twice, what to say about them, about him except that how a man treats his own children is only one part of his story and there are others."

            "question": "That is from your book?",
            "answer": "That\u2019s from my book the Royal Baker\u2019s Daughter. And the whole first section of that book is kind of about growing up in a house where atrocity 1s always the undertone. The next poem I\u2019Il read is from Cautionary Tales and this poem is about my mother and just imagine that the I in this poem is my mother speaking. Survivor. And the child by the way is me. They say I should feed you, child with a gift of tongues. But darting through woods of dark pine, hounds chase the scent of sandals. Days spent under cover in a field of eiderdown. My fingers searched for traces of my own lost mother. At night when the bulb shines through the parchment and I scrub my body down with soap, I think of her parting lace curtains, looking for father to round the corner. A small patch of pine presses against the north side of this house. Here, by Union Turnpike, a car is parked in the driveway.  https://collections.ushmm.org  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Barbara Goldberg 34 August 22, 2012 We\u2019d all fit in, all if we had to make a quick journey. I keep a bar of gold under my pillow. They bring you to me, my locket clasped in your fist. I want to feed you. It\u2019s those spiked needles that scrape against the glass, those shadows that won\u2019t sleep behind the drapes. It\u2019s that woodsman walking through this forest swinging his ax. I said just a little while ago where the undertone, where the undertone 1s everything and this poem is called Uninvited Guests and it\u2019s also from Cautionary Tales and it has an epigraph, three can keep a secret if two are corpses. And that\u2019s a Yiddish folk saying. Even the dead can\u2019t keep a secret. They barge in, sit at your table, demanding to be served. They bang their spoons like children, crying feed me, feed me. And you have never prepared enough. Once you would have welcomed the dead, begged mother to set out extra plates, but now they consume what was promised to the living. They climb into the marriage bed with their own unearthly linen, whispering old secrets you wish they would keep to themselves."

            "answer": "No I don\u2019t actually because Royal Baker\u2019s Daughter is my fourth book of poetry and the Royal Baker\u2019s Daughter 1s like to me, that\u2019s the close of the chapter, because it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s only been you know been out for the last couple of years. And it\u2019s really reflects a life time of not just observing but trying to understand what their lives, how their lives and their histories were taken in by me. And it\u2019s possible I might write fiction about it but as far as the poems, I just, I don\u2019t think I will. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. I mean for a whole year I was writing mother poems saying please spare me, not another mother poem, but you don\u2019t have any control over what you'll be writing about."

            "answer": "Well she\u2019s obviously the poor stepchild. She\u2019s getting the leftovers from the royal house, from the royal king and queen. Her father is the royal baker. He just makes the stuff. She\u2019s getting the crumbs. That\u2019s putting it quite overtly, but actually it refers, it\u2019s a line from a poem that\u2019s in the book that\u2019s not really about my parents at all. But I think it does reflect that fact that  https://collections.ushmm.org  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Barbara Goldberg 35 August 22, 2012 even though I wasn\u2019t starving that I might have felt that I was starving. So that\u2019s what the title means to me. Cautionary Tales well I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of what\u2019s his name. Those books that were read to me when I was a child. Oh my god, how could do that strugel pather and these, these terrible tales of what happens to bad children. Like I used to suck my thumb and there\u2019s a story in there about how a tailor comes at night and cuts off the thumb. So \u2014"

            "answer": "Funny you should say that because I\u2019ve never been to Germany because my mother always used to say she could never go back to that country and she said Austria was just as bad, if not worse in terms of the anti-Semitism. And that if she were in Germany she\u2019d never know who did what. And I guess I absorbed those feelings too. I remember her being quite upset with my sister when she bought a Mercedes. How could she do that? But this trip I\u2019m taking with my sister, it\u2019s a pleasure trip. It\u2019s not a history trip. But we\u2019re taking a river cruise up the Rhine. So it will be my first time in Germany which I always kind of said was unconscionably beautiful from what I could see. But again those woods and so I guess I will see. And I know that I have some time after the trip. And I feel a compulsion to go to \u2014 compulsion because we end up in Amsterdam. But I want to go to Berlin because I understand that it\u2019s a very interesting city and it is acity where my father lived for some time. So I'll be doing that too. And I do speak a kind of child\u2019s German. So I won\u2019t feel \u2014 I\u2019m not comfortable going to a country where I don\u2019t speak the language, but I will understand most of it.  https://collections.ushmm.org  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Barbara Goldberg 36 August 22, 2012"

And when I hear German it\u2019s like it\u2019s not my mother tongue cause my mother tongue I guess is English. But in a way it is, because it\u2019s what I heard before I could speak. So I feel you know I don\u2019t feel oh my god a Nazi when I went for therapy or whatever, I went with an analyst who was Austrian German, cause the accent just made me feel at home. And that she would understand. There are words that exist in German that I don\u2019t even know what they are in English. Forvufa [ph], my mother always used to say Mach me kind of forvufa [ph]. I don\u2019t know, don\u2019t make any accusations. I don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t, don\u2019t give me a hard time. I just don\u2019t even know how to do it and I\u2019m sure there are things in English that are untranslatable too. But if I knew that you know if I threw in a German word cause the English didn\u2019t occur to me, it would be understood."

And at the time I was just very committed to it and took it seriously and I said I don\u2019t want a band aid, I want surgery. But you know you don\u2019t have another way of comparing. I mean I think a lot of the things might have come to me anyway, just by getting older and more experienced. Having made my own mistakes. But I think I really started writing poetry seriously during it so yes, for that I\u2019m grateful. I mean before that I was writing short stories and stuff like that."

And I mean his stories were amazing. And he had no ambivalence about talking about them, but I mean the story of how it was in terms. I mean I just can maybe it\u2019s cause I can picture Mengele so clearly doing that. And so the image of it is so permanent within me.

And it\u2019s hard to put, it\u2019s just so odd to think that these were all people who had suffered trauma, even if they themselves hadn\u2019t been in the camp. In terms of being torn up from their lives. And they were \u2014 it was like the Israelis in a way. They were partying with a vengeance because Israel\u2019s like that a lot. I mean everything is so intense and you feel you have to live to you know make up for everything that\u2019s come before. And you may not see another day.
