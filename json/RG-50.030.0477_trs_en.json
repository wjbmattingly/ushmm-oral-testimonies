            "answer": "My formal name is Charles Siegman, my birth name is Charlie Sigmann, or Jechiel Sigmann, I was born Jechiel, the Hebrew name, and that itself is a introduction to where I come from. People always ask, how does a good Jewish boy get the name Charlie from Holland. And the story is that my father had to register me. In Holland, all children had to be registered by an official roster of names. And when my father came, he asked what\u2019s child\u2019s name, he answered Chiel, which was the shortened name for Jechiel. And Chiel was not on the list of names, and he had to choose an official name. So the first Ch was Charlie. That was a Dutch name, and so my name became Charlie. And when I came to United States, they changed it to Charles, because Charlie looked like a child name."

So when the soldiers who were dressed in Dutch uniforms, German soldiers, the early stage of the war, were asked whether you\u2019re, you know, friend or foe, and say Scheveningen vischenschuit, they said Scheveningense vischenschuit and they were shot. So that\u2019s the part of the town, anyway, it\u2019s a small town."

            "answer": "Right. My father was born in Poland, Przemysl, established Jewish little community, and he moved to western Europe, I believe first to Germany, then to Holland, in the 20\u2019s, before he was married, in fact.[indecipherable] long time settler, and was another refugee coming from eastern Europe, or from Germany to Holland, lived there for many years. He was not a citizen ever, he was stateless, he was Polish nationality. But for Holland he was called stateless, but Polish nationality, I believe. My mother came originally from Zborow, which people think wer -- was Hungary, could be Ukraine, cause the countries this -- have shifted management over time, and was raised in Switzerland. At a very young age she moved to Switzerland. Her parents were -- grandparents, parents were one of the early settlers of the east European families who moved to Zurich. Again, that family, that group of families, I was told, could not move to Zurich, didn\u2019t have the right to move to Zurich, they moved outside of Zurich, to -- they had a lot of restrictions. And my parents were married in the early 20\u2019s -- in \u201922, and the wedding had to be held in Frankfurt, because a large number of members of the family couldn\u2019t receive visas to go to Zurich, where the -- typically, the bride\u2019s family town would be the wedding. I have the wedding picture of that wedding with me, which is a nice memento. That also has a Shoah story about it in fact. But anyhow, my father lived in Holland, and he was a postage stamp dealer, had a postage stamp store, had a wholesaler type of business, and had the store and lived origin -- he originally lived in Amsterdam with my older brothers were born in Amsterdam, and then moved to Scheveningen, and he had a store in one of the main streets. So he was a middle class person, nothing, no -- not an activist, not a Socialist, not a pervert, or what have you, and belonged to the east European community in Scheveningen."

But that was the job, to collect stamps from the other countries, and organize them by country, and know the dates, and the value, and they sell them to dealers, or to customers. So, postage stamps. He had his own, apparently a very personal, good postage stamp collection as well, which he gave over to someone, acquaintance or a friend, we don\u2019t know exactly who, before the war. It never returned after the war."

            "answer": "It was a household that was living, I would call middle class life, going to do certain activities, like with fam -- family oriented activities, and Scheveningen was a resort town, so there were a lot of visitors, and to this day it\u2019s still a resort town, the beach, and -- so it was an active household. I don\u2019t know much about the social life of my family, so I can\u2019t relate to that. But so I know from the child [indecipherable] I do recall two personal incidents which are interesting in their own right, but the fact that I recall them, but also the interesting feature is that both of these little child events -- childhood events where I was actually was saved, kind of -- that\u2019s all I recall. The first one was I was lost in the beach. So the family went to the beach, that\u2019s [indecipherable] a kind of standard activity, it was probably on a Sunday, and I was lost, that\u2019s not unusual. And the police picked me up, and I do recall that I was sitting on the policeman\u2019s lap, with a policeman\u2019s cap on my head, waiting [indecipherable] was apparently relaxed enough, till they found -- till I was found, I think my brother came to pick me up, and then reunited with the family, so I was saved. That was what -- what -- what do we do. Second episode which I recall, was I took a walk with my sister [indecipherable] or Leah, and walked through a -- most probably a shortcut through a park, and was hit by a wooden swing, that time the swings were wood, and I was apparently unconscious. I had a sort of a scar right over here. They tell me that had it been a m -- centimeter or two above, I would have been brain dead, centimeter below, I\u2019d have been blind, because I had a big, heavy impact. I had stitches. Those days you had stitches with like staples, I remember that. And I remember the gift coming home to soothe my return, was a wind-up crocodile, which I wound up and I played on the dining room table, back and forth. So these are kind of vignettes which I recall, but they kind of illustrate I\u2019d led a child\u2019s normal, quotation mark, child\u2019s life in a home environment."

The hou -- I mean, the household, as far as I recall, I have heard was kind of gran -- rather normal.

First of all, Holland has two or three communities, the more -- can\u2019t say native, but more Spanish, Portuguese Dutch are oriented, people had a number of generations. They had their own synagogues, and own community. Then there were the east European Jews who came in, who were not always well accepted and integrated. But in Europe in general, there was much more traditional conduct by people affiliated with synagogues, and went. My parents were fully observant, a kosher home, and active in Zionist organizations. My brother -- my older brothers, Josef and Aron belonged to what later became Brei Akiva, but precursor of those that were active in that, and I do kind of have memories on Shabbat afternoons, they were leaving to their groups. All I really remember of my two older brothers in a mental, visua -- visual image, is two lanky, tall boys with berets -- common people used to wear berets, and weeker pants, which were rolled up at the bottom a little bit, leaving, coming and going. But they were kind of active in youth organizations.

Because that already in -- was -- was probably the fall, I assume school began in the fall like over here, was come to the end of our freedom, because people -- there were deportations, and there were round-ups and there were sh -- transports taking place, so there was some discussion whether or not I should start school. In retrospect it appears that my family, my parents were almost, I think, you know, how to deal with the family situation of how to -- not escape, but wh -- w -- to find means t -- how to survive. So if they have to -- if I hid -- if they would place me in hiding, or what have you, then you don\u2019t start school, necessarily.

Then they tried to find ways which regarded what are -- where could we or our children be safe? And the idea of splitting up families was not a illogical step, that if some people can\u2019t make it, other could make it. And very often, you can\u2019t have a place for seven people, you can have a place for two or three. So you had to split up on practical grounds. So, did it hit me that something was affecting me, you know, lifetime orsat, I doubt it, it was kind of incremental, another step or so. But di -- bottom line was, you know, I was separated from my parents at that age, and that was it. And then separated from my brothers and mother, and that was it. And I was with my little -- older brother, few years older, and a little older sister, and that we were together. And then I followed what was -- not instructed, where I was told to go, where to go, and move, and I moved along with the -- the flow."

So this int -- this -- they halted the shipments for a week or so. That week was critical for us, because while we were there, during that quarantine, a very good friend of our family\u2019s in Amsterdam, Mrs. DeYoung, informed, by telegram most probably, Westerbork authorities, the Jewish people, or the council people who worked there, that documents from our family in Switzerland, with Honduran passports, and also, I think, Palestine visas were made available for us and our parents and brothers. Unfortunately for them it came too late. But that week of window saved us, because then we put in different category of person, because we had Central American passports, and they treated that a little separate, and the Palestine visa part, they also had some benefit for awhile, because they wanted to exchange German prisoners for British citizens or what have you, and it put us into a different classification of detainee, and then we were in this new category, and we were put into different grouping.

And we put in that group, a man named Birnbaum, Mr. Birnbaum, originally from Germany apparently, and that was his task. He had a number of children as well, so I became friendly with his child, or he\u2019d like me to play with his child, so I hung around his house more than the standard barracks most of the day. And I kind of took care of us, collectively. But that status helped us, because we not put on lists. There is one episode my brother related to me, which I obviously was not aware of. They didn\u2019t always trust those documents, [indecipherable] they were -- were suspicious, and the fact came from Switzerland helped a little bit, but they called my brother in, and was asking him what do you know about Honduras? Do you speak Honduran [indecipherable] knows what. So he was called in, and he was primed by someone, I think a Dutch lawyer, what he should say. And he was told that his mother\u2019s in Switzerland, to kind of confirm it, the source came -- that came from his mother, rather than relatives. She was Swiss born, somehow. Was -- lived in Switzerland many years, and apparently -- he told me recently again, that he was called in, and they asked him this question, you know, how\u2019d you get these things? My mother\u2019s in Switzerland. And they accepted, asked what -- where\u2019s your father, and he didn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t given any prompting for that, so he somehow answered, he\u2019s dead, and they let him go. But again, I mean, those are kind of intermediate steps where our status was even being questioned, and had they determined that it was a fake, it wasn\u2019t -- we weren\u2019t really, you know, Honduran citizens, or whatever, the passports were not -- we then would have been shipped, that interval.

I can recall episodes of cold -- periods, but not as a personal suffering part, that it was ca -- always cold, always ya -- again, in retrospect I just don\u2019t recall how we survived both the deprivation and weather conditions, both in Westerbork, and Terezin, which is even colder, because we didn\u2019t come with, you know, baggage of clothing. Must have had some bags, and as we moved up in age, we grew. Now, I may have taken my brother\u2019s clothing, but [indecipherable] my brother get? Now, we didn\u2019t grow that much. We were stunted in our growth, most probably, but we still grew. So the question mark still is, where did we get our clothing? We may have gotten it from other people who left, and the children\u2019s home may well have supplied us. But we didn\u2019t certainly have our own wardrobe to take care of us, particularly in cold weather. So every so often I do reflect, how did we manage in cold weather in general, with limited clothing, and not having our own clothing, nobody -- no parents, nobody to provide. But I -- I sp -- I assume that these people like Mr. Birnbaum, and subsequently in Theresienstadt the woman who took care of us, kind of assembled material, and that there -- that was part of their job, to make sure the children under their charge have clothing. And where they got it from was probably from people who had to -- we-were transported and left, and then it redistributed. So I don\u2019t know how bitter the cold was for me personally.

No, but we were told that ending up in west -- in Terezin -- see, in Theresienstadt-stadt, as you know, was a place where they -- that st -- sent people -- a s-second holding place, holding pattern. Primarily people who had certain privileges stay -- privileged status, and our status kind of held, and therefore Westerbork was a place to -- transits, spot to get people out, and so we were there in some sense too long, we didn\u2019t belong in Westerbork because we\u2019re not transit people, and we were not transit to get transported, so they moved them to a new place, which -- Theresienstadt, which was designed for our kinds of people, all kinds of privileged people. I had no idea that I was privileged obviously, but that settled in later. But -- so I had no sense that that\u2019s a new regime, you know, for me. But my brother and sister were there, of course, must -- that must have been very reassuring, to have my brother and sister with me on an ongoing basis. That was my anchor of family stability, and the rest was activities throughout the day, or evening. So when I was -- when we were going to Terezin, we were put under the auspices of a social worker from Amsterdam, also was being shipped there with her husband, her name was Malka Weinmann, and her husband Paul Weinmann, who -- they placed some children under their responsibility. And we ended up in the train, which again I do remember the physical feature of the train, 1t was a compar -- a European compartment train, was probably third class, but it was not the cattle train, which people unfortunately were subjected to as well. Was a commercial type of train with compartment, and we sat there, my brother, my sister, myself, the two Weinmanns, two elderly people, Rosens, elderly people, and another girl Alicia Farber, who was separated from her parents, so she was all alone as well. And we had this train trip to another place. And in the train, I was -- was probably playing on the floor, with whatever we had over there, and Miss Malka Pollaczek had a suitcase which I opened up, as a curious child would ordinarily do, and I played with whatever she had over there, I inspected it. And it was a big t-tin can there, and I asked her what is this all about, what is this for? And so she tells me, we\u2019 ll use that at happy occasion. Turns out it was used for a happy occasion, subsequently for my brother\u2019s Bar Mitzvah, close to -- to the following year. But that -- that scene of the train ride I remember like a photograph, sitting there, and we moved onto -- from Westerbork to Theresienstadt."

So whatever we had -- what it was inside our bag, I have no clue, nor does my brother really remember. I asked him. But people had their belongings. And when we came to Theresienstadt, we were placed with the Dutch population. They was s- segmented, they compartmentalized the people. Sometimes different groups met all across th-the borders, in some sense, but we were among the Dutch. That again, in retrospect most probably helped because again, Dutch language was the language we sp - | heard, and people spoke. Not that we knew people -- I don\u2019t think we knew many people over there, but some -- turned out we had some relatives of my mother as well, whom we dealt with, my brother more than I. And we were put under -- she became our guardian, Malka Pollaczek. And she, in fact, was put in charge of the children\u2019s home in Terezin as well, which came to my advantage later. The Dutch compound, we were put in the caserne, that -- not -- not barracks, barracks were flat, usually, and caserne was pretty impressive stone buildings with courtyards, and surrounding were -- originally were made for quarters for soldiers. And they used it for the people who were put into Theresienstadt, in detention purposes, and they multiplied the number of people in the -- those casernes were multiples of what the soldiers were in, was very crowded. Had three tiers, beds -- three bunk beds. And men were separated from the women. And I now went with my brother, and my sister was -- what -- was accessible, I went to visit my sister."

Bedbugs, lice on the beds, killing at night was an activity, you know to s-swipe them, do away with them. And then had get -- got a new routine in Terezin. Now, Terezin I remember a little bit more, because I was older, so I have more mental images of Terezin. In ret -- in comparison to everything else, it was spacious. Was -- okay? Because you had these big courtyards, and then from caserne to caserne there was another walkway, and when you moved down from there -- there I did walk outside of the caserne for a reason I\u2019Il tell you in a minute. So you had a sense of not being totally confined to one building, or one narrow area. And that kind of tri -- helped the physical benefit from being that -- not [indecipherable] confined. But it wa -- once you\u2019re in the barracks, it was very crowded. But I was basically confined to that quarters for line-up, for soup, for the meals, and for daily activity. And the learning study group I mentioned before, the study group was up in that loft, up to the left, if I recall correctly, where we -- I went on a basis. So I didn\u2019t, again, wander around much till later in Terezin. And a lot of the parts of Terezin I never stepped across, because I had no business to be there. I may not even allowed to be there for all I know. So you stuck where you belonged, and where I had some reason to be. And my reasons to be, to go to visit my sister, or go to the study place, the first stage of my stay there. And spent the time there."

            "answer": "Yeah, yeah, well see, because we were very close -- lived. We were associated very close to the transport. Outside there was a big fence, a metal fence, and a major part of the day I spent around that fence watching the activity of the train depot. A lot of them -- the arrivals I saw. And when the arrivals came, there was a lot of discussion, because not only I, other people standing over there, where they from? Cause sometimes they came from towns close by. Or from relatives they had, even if they\u2019re from a dif -- different country. So that people were identified, and the Czech group came in, so the people said, oh not for me, I don\u2019t know anybody. Or the Danish came, late at the end of the thing, same story. So -- but the time you -- first you saw the arrivals, so some you knew, so that this came a discussion point, and people tried to see whether they knew anybody. And they came from Holland, it was a big excitement, because suddenly people -- the adults met acquaintances, or even relatives, and I was part of the -- the watching scenery and taking it in, but not -- no -- I had met -- I never met -- met anybody who I knew, obviously, or anybody who was look -- looking for me. Although subsequently I have to mention to you, some distant relatives of my mother did arrive, and later on we had contact with them. So the [indecipherable] contact with us, obviously. Did I know people were leaving? I saw transports too, but what 1t meant -- you see, two way traffic, all right? But the injection of new coming -- I did sense, of the people with whom I dealt with, that they weren\u2019t there any more after awhile. So there was a [indecipherable] whether people made friendships or so, it\u2019s different -- different friendships with people are there for two months, or three months, and fending for themselves, and then they disappear. You become acquaintance, and then you know somebody\u2019s name, and suddenly -- sit next to them in the study group, and he is no longer there. I had that sense of coming, going, people moving in and moving out, but where they were going, I had no idea. Where they came from was the curiosity to be discovered. And 1n line-ups -- in the time of day we had line-ups, the different groups lined up near the fences, so that conversations started taking place, and you started picking up, you know, different languages. Danish sing-song, and as a kid started making fun, or trying to imitate, and learning different phrases from people. But I\u2019d never picked up the language, okay? But there as a lot of interact -- not lot, there was interaction, we had an hour, half hour, how long it took to wait, and we saw different nationalities, and different languages, and kind of came [indecipherable] curious what was going on. So there was more -- I think the arrivals left a bigger impact on me than the departures, because I had no idea where people are going. I knew where they came from. And you -- suddenly you sit next to the Danes, and you sit next to the Hungarians when they came at the end. But we were not allowed to mix, and we -- there really was a fence between the nationalities, unless they put them in the same caserne. So I became more aware of the change of population of Westerbork over time, but the immediate group of people whom -- who I deal with, my brother and my sister, Malka Weinmann and her husband, midway were shipped out to Auschwitz, cause she was more Dutch, and he was more -- he was Czech originally. So they categorized him, he came under her auspices, and she had other potential [indecipherable] I\u2019m not clear why she survived, but she did. Anyway, that part I -- that one part of the middle of our stay, he was shipped out in [indecipherable] and I do kind of have a image of her being sad for one period of there, but could have been anything, or so, but later on she told me it was -- what was happening."

We had a place to go because somebody was claiming us."

But since we had a relative who was putting a claim us and offered t-to come to them, we went with Malka Pollaczek, who also had a brother, and Alicia Farber, whose parents survived. So she was reunited with her parents, so her parents were claiming her. So we all went back on the train from Terezin to the American section, you know, Czechoslovakia kind of was split into different regions whoever liberated them. One half was the Russians, one half was the Americans or the French, I think. And we took a train from Terezin to Pilsen, and maybe took a plane from Pilsen to Amsterdam, I think a French plane, was probably a army transport plane. And we stayed a few days or so with Malka Weinmann, because we were close to her. And you ask what attachment, that was probably -- I -- we sensed that. And well, a very different life suddenly, you know, plates, and tables, and food that we never had eaten before. White bread was served, we thought it was cake, we refused to eat it as bread. I had a tin can of anchovy paste, I don\u2019t know whether you know what anchovy paste is, it was in a tin -- a tin little thing like toothpaste, imported [indecipherable] foods never crossed my lips.

            "num": 367,
            "question": "And how was that for you?",
            "answer": "Again, they were very caring, and very warm, and very attentive to us, but they themselves had to reconstruct their lives, because they had a major interruption in their life. So we took in the scene of reconstituting life, but was really more normal from what people were used to. I mean, s-sitting at a table with the family rather than in a compound. Cooking, baking, washing. You know, th-this family, the Bergers, they were hidden by some nurses, single women who had worked in Indonesia before, and I think they lived at Amsterdam. And they lived behind a partition wall for several years. Couldn\u2019t go out in daytime. Didn\u2019t know where their daughter and son was -- were. Their daughter was too old to be hidden, but too young to be hidden, too, so she had had a quote, an Aryan appearance, so she worked for somebody in the outskirts of Amsterdam as a open house help, au pair. It\u2019s -- her name is Miriam. And she was there, and -- very interesting story is that we -- we -- once we came back, and told us their -- their tale, and each one has his own tale of escape and saving. But this girl, Miriam, mus-must have been around 16 maybe, by the end of the war, was in -- publicly hidden, and the people were very devout, Calvinist, or [indecipherable] most people did not e -- travel -- or com- can\u2019t do anything on a Sunday. That when they later on came to visit us, visit us on Saturday in fact, apologized that we came on the sebbe -- Sabbath. But they were very devout, they were very close to the family, but they were very good people, too. They -- in order to -- they kept the fact that she was Jewish in hiding, or public hiding from their own children, so they couldn\u2019t say very much, but they read the scriptures, and how the very devout Christians, and they tried to read the Scriptures associated with the holidays, to keep this girl informed about purink and how do the calendar, or what have you, but sh- Passover, and Easter, often overlap, so they read this -- the -- the portion she told us about, it was kind of -- and they\u2019re very nice people. We met them after they came, they were very close. But kind of seeing how people were coming out of the war, and what they went through, was both interesting, and it was very common. Their son, who was a tall fellow, was in hiding in a little attic, in a little town up in -- in the country, again didn\u2019t see daylight, public daylight for several years. And he was an artist and he made wooden pins for the underground, emblems. I believe that\u2019s how he spent his time. And so the reconstituting of life in Amsterdam was -- we were part of it, but we [indecipherable] we were visiting. These Bergers are interesting people because they used to have a restaurant, kosher restaurant in Amsterdam, a very elegant one apparently, before the war, and they had pretty elegant dishes, and cutlery, but after the war their apartment was gone, all their belongings were gone. They couldn\u2019t -- they knew who they gave it, they couldn\u2019t get it back, even because they survived. People denied, apparently that they had received anything. They had to start from scratch, in very small quarters, we lived in very, very small quarters. There was no shower or bathtub in the house. We had a little metal bathtub that we -- I was a little boy, I was able to use, other people used most probably too, and we went to public baths. This was the life. But for them it was a -- happy to survive, but was a big setback of their lifestyle to what they had to live through, and remember that. Of course they would -- had the restaurant before, they\u2019re still -- so they\u2019re getting the old customers coming back, come and eat. Some widowers, or single people, lost their family. So they used to come in the evening and se -- were served things. Whether they paid or not, I don\u2019t know. But they kind of resumed the sort of role [indecipherable] that was their past life, and lot of war stories were coming around the table. You know, sort of hearing these things, the -- we were kind of a special case, now we had one experience, people had very different experience. The hiding, some survived, but only, you know, one person. And some people were traumatized, and completely troubled. And I remember one man, he used to come to visit [indecipherable] Berger to talk or his despair -- despair. And I remember he was a very sad person, and he really -- when that man came in in the evening, we would kind of shoot out of the room, the small quarters. And a month or so later we learned he committed suicide. So those kind of things, you k -- that was the ac -- different things were going on in Amsterdam, it was -- it was not a normal return to life, again. These people, the Bergers, at this restaurant, also kept kosher, obviously. And basically ate dairy, because they didn\u2019t have any dishes and cutlery for meat, and moreover, meat was very scarce anyhow, because that time the only meat you could get, kosher meat was in cans, preserved. But because of their hospitality reputation, and restaurant reputation, the soldiers in the Jewish brigade, who passed through Holland from Canada, or from England, stopped in ou -- those who kept kosher, stayed in their house, or ate in their house. But they brought their rations over to the Bergers, so the only time we ate meat was to eat those rations the first time, after many years eating meat. But didn\u2019t have enough cutlery, or -- and no plates. So the cans were warmed up on the stove, and we passed around the can and this cutlery in order to eat. That\u2019s the kind of -- for them it must have been a terribly painful contrast after being a elegant restaurant with all the trappings of a restaurant, having to serve their own in this way. But they made -- they made the transition, we\u2019ll open up another restaurant a number of years."

Th -- when I say people who were eager to leave were the older people [indecipherable] not sure, take these two children of my relatives, Bergers, Miriam and Manfred, they got out as fast, but they wanted to leave right away, I mean they were -- imagine not being with their parents for several years, and May, June they see them, and they wanted to get out, on -- go to Palestine. The parents did not -- were not encouraging that right away, but reluctantly they yielded, so right after the high holidays, they left on the illegal transport, where they were put in Cypress, they ga -- had a long journey. But -- so that age bracket and above, there was a much greater personal decision to leave Europe, or leave Netherlands. They both went to Palestine. One of them there right now. The tragedy was that the brother ended up in Palestine. When the state was established, he was in the army, and he was killed by a convoy in the protection of Jerusalem during the War of Independence. Was just -- had just become engaged to a beautiful Yemenite girl, and so now that\u2019s -- the family had to absorb that loss after being spared the other hurdles of the war, ended up a victim in Palestine - Israel. Parents not fully revere -- recovered from that wound, whereas the war wounds were healing, that wound kind of was pretty difficult for them to deal with. But other people also were leaving. And in contrast to the pre-war, which I don\u2019t recall too much, Westerbork or Terezin, there I did have friends. I visited homes like in more normal circumstances. But again, 1t was somewhat temporary, because people I dealt with, they moved out to other countries suddenly, okay? And myself also left. But it was a different -- but I do know the names of people who were there. We joined the youth organization, I think it was the precursor of Bnei Akiva. My brother was older, he was allowed to join, I tagged along with him, and given that was much choice, not too many other children around, they let me come. And we went to hikes and activities. So we had a little more normal type of event, of youth organizations that obviously you didn\u2019t have before, and some of the names of the people from that period I still know by name. And I\u2019ve discovered recently one is in t -- married, you know, with families in Toronto, and one lives in Israel, and one here, one no longer lives. But that kind of life became more normalized. I went to school in Amsterdam, Jewish school, and es -- had special studies, Jewish studies in either synagogue, with people. So it kind of -- but even those teachers started leaving. We had the teacher, and the middle of the year they went to England. Of course, it was not a -- people weren\u2019t on the firm ground, or so. So we -- I -- when I left, it was not unnatural for me to leave, because that\u2019s what other people were doing for all kinds of reasons, which I may not have been fully aware. But it was not my decision, of sorts, because my other relatives, who were closer in relative ranking that the Bergers, my father\u2019s brother lived the United States, and they were also related to the Bergers so they were in touch, wanted us to join him. And my mother\u2019s sister in Zurich wanted us to join them. So we were wanted, but we were kind of being pulled in two different directions. And the decision was that the two boys would go to New York, and the girl would go to Zurich. Whether that\u2019s wi -- wise decision or not 1s not for me to say."

            "answer": "Or so -- so, y -- generally even in Holland after the war, there were all kinds of new ec -- experiences or so, about food, or otherwise. I remember with my bo -- my uncle from Switzerland, who took us out and treated us to vanilla ice cream. And the pungency of that vanilla taste is still in my mouth, I mean, I just -- it\u2019s very different today, doesn\u2019t have the same intensity of taste, but it was a very strong taste, a flavor which I never had, or don\u2019t recall, I may have had it when I was five or six. But from five to six to nine was a long time. So those things kind of, you know, were all sensations that we experienced. There was an ho -- another interesting thing was I was saying of -- people were kind of coming out of the woodwork in some sense. The people who were in hiding got out right away, from the camps. Those who had a place to go had right away -- some straggled in, depends where they were kept, in which camp. So it was an ongoing process of people coming, and eventually people leaving. Was a lot of young people, particularly children had to be taken out of convents or hiding places, and was a big battle sometimes, you know, older sisters f -- survived. [indecipherable] little sister was in the convent in Belgium, went through the effort, identified everything [indecipherable] and that little girl refused to come. Again, in this Berger household we had a lot of traffic, but people -- there was a home, people came across. So I in some sense absorbed more of that than I would have otherwise. And I remember those two sisters finally successful in getting out, this whole discussion of getting their little sister out, finally getting their sister out, and the sister rebellious, she wants to go back to the sisters in Belgium, rather than the sisters in Holland. And I think eventually she had -- had -- had to yield it, they got -- bring her back. You know, the chief rabbi of Israel, Rabbi Herzog went through country to country, also through Holland, trying to save those children, invoking his position in dealing with the clergy, and the church. And had very great difficult time, I remember him there with his top hat, and making, you know, talking about his experiences. That was an event. So, it was -- th-the post-war reconstitution was very much an activity of the country, of the Jewish community. And therefore was a lot of activity and movement, and was not a -- you know, a stable community, were never -- never really became stable, because Holland as you know, lost a very high proportion of it\u2019s Jewish population. Underestimated the people talk about [indecipherable]. The interesting little side story, my relative, my uncle -- I call him uncle, he was a Berger, had a brother in Palestine, who was a -- ashoe store. And one day he sent a crate of Yaffa oranges to him. And that was a communion celebration, they handed out these oranges as prizes to people, and everybody took those -- an orange for their entire family. And there was the biggest gift they could ever dream of after going through the war, of getting something from Palestine, a Yaffa orange. So, I remember we got one too, and it was something, you know, unique. So a lot of feelings were going on in the country, which today people have much less -- they take a lot of things for granted. Every -- every -- ev -- all these events became events rather than, you know, part of a routine life. So 1t was, 1n some sense, quote, exciting. Because things were really appearing, and I was -- as I was getting older, I was a -- absorbing these things much more than anything before [indecipherable] certainly I was a little boy, but already approaching 10 - 11, to move on there. So carry back interesting memories of the year in Holland."

This picture went through the war itself, because my cousin carried with him through certain concentration camps, and by good circumstances it was finally brought to our attention, so this was salvaged, and this is the kind of big collective origin picture."

Until World War two, that\u2019s all existed on the beach as far as the visible building, now it is all built up around it, so it doesn\u2019t look as identifiable any more.

To the left, the woman with the beret is Malka Weinmann, who kept close to us, both in Amsterdam, and when she came to United States, stayed with -- friendly with us, on good -- very good terms. She is, I think, holding a -- a hand of the little nephew. And the woman on the right is a sister of Pepi Berger, who was a Regina Felsen, or Feldrin, who married during the war, and -- to a Dutch person, and she was part of the family as well. So this is a kind of contemporary Amsterdam picture. Contemporary 1946."
