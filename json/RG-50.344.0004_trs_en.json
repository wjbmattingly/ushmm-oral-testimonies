Had a coronary down -- big lake down there, the age of 43 and that kind of took the starch out of us. And my other brother got out of practice a few years later to do research for Squibb\u2122s drug company, radioactive isotopes.

I think we had one at Ruth Eberly\u2122s house. Then we had one in Brooklyn and just about -- say about eight, nine years ago, most of the girls who had married , their children are grown up and we always kept in touch with Christmas cards, if nothi ng else and we decided to start having the reunions. And I was lucky enough to have a big enough place that they could come and it was central and we started having it, mostly up here. In the wintertime, occasionally we have one at Ellen Bo -- Ellen Marchese\u2122s place in Florida. Just a lunch. And then last year we had one up at Louise Birch\u2122s place in New Hampshire. And I must have had about five or six here. But we always had a good time and -- and it\u2122s good to see them all, really good. Love seeing them, hope we can keep it up.
