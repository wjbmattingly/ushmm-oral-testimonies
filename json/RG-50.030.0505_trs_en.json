So we were sitting, I remember it very well.

            "answer": "No, I didn\u2019t go there, no. But you see, this is a very complicated question, this Jewish and Lithuanian reaction to those times, because it was quite clear after, that we are trapped between two super powers. And it is also absolutely obvious, and it couldn\u2019t be different, that for Lithuanians, maybe still the ger -- e-e-especially after the deportation, that for the Lithuanians still, the Germans are better, and for the Jews are still the Soviets better. And I learned now recently, I was calling our institute of resistance on genocide, and I ask them how many people were deported, and how many people came back from Siberia. So I was told that in \u201941, the last information is 17,000. After the war it was hundred -- about 130,000. So -- including the Jews, who were also deported. So, as a whole, about 150,000. Now, from the people who were deported in 1941, only about 20 percent came back, but from the people -- but these are so not very precise figures. And fa -- from the people who were deported in -- after the war, until \u201951 or \u201950 -- I don\u2019t know how long, think un-until \u201951, or maybe *53, I don\u2019t remember now exactly, the deportation -- 70 percent came back. From the Holocaust very few people came back, so it was still even better in -- in the -- for -- for Jews it\u2019s a paradox, but in some way they were saved. And for instance our -- such a Jewish writer, Josade, he saved his parents from deportation and he could -- he suffered his whole life. Actually, you made a film about him, he suffered his whole life, that he really killed his parents because he saved them from the Soviet deportation. They got killed in -- in the Holocaust. So it 1s -- yeah. But, also among the Lithuanian, I would say, intellige -- intelligentsia, among the loudeninke, this was the m-m -- the Volksparte1, the -- no, they were not socialists, but close to socialists. So they were thinking, what\u2019s better, the Germans or the Soviets? And they decided better the Soviets. Why? Because under Germany, under the German governance, for instance, Prussia disappeared. No -- no -- no traces of Prussia any more. And under the Tsarist time, which was 200 years, we not only didn\u2019t disappear, but we developed our, in Lithuania, the resistance movement. The -- the -- re-revival of the nation. So, that e -- we will -- we will be able to resist the Russian -- the Russian -- the -- the Soviet, and better not to deal with the -- with the Germans. Then also, some people, they\u2019re fascinated, like for instance, Paletskis, or -- or Vanslovar, or Kemontite or Gregorouskas, or other people, they were fascinated by the official [indecipherable], and they thought that even if we join the Soviet Union, we will still stay a Lithuanian republic, and we will have our national culture and rights. So it was, you know -- but after the deportations, then of course, the -- the Wehrmacht, the German army was met by Lithuanians with flowers. So -- but that\u2019s also understandable, because it was like saving from the deportation to Siberia. Was a very complicated situation, and is very interesting that in Poland -- you know the story with the [indecipherable] where Poles killed, not- not -- not Nazis, but Poles killed. So it is also in the region where the Soviets were before, where the deportations took place, and so on, you see? Then there is also another such moment, which can\u2019t be forgotten. Of course in -- in -- in Lithuania, the Jews had cultural autonomy and -- autonomy and so on, but it was not such an absolutely equal situation for everybody. Jews couldn\u2019t take government positions, high up positions in the army. They served in the army, but not on high -- or very few of them became officers and so on. And they didn\u2019t feel like equal citizens of Lithuania, but the in -- the independence times was only 20 years, that\u2019s a very short time. And when the Soviets came, so they declared that everybody\u2019s equal, and quite a few Jews got into the administration, got into, you know, official positions. I -- I -- sorry -- and -- and it was like an illusion that now we are equal. But this was absolutely illusion. And i -- and I must say ma -- but I came now -- come now a little bit back, my uncle, the brother of my mother, Jorge Stromas is -- was a very, very educated person, he got his education in France and he came back and he had an official position in the -- in -- in the Ministry of Finance, and was very, of course, helpful, but then he had to leave it, because he was Jewish. So, you see, he was still a -- a very much -- he was a [indecipherable] because he lacked very much the language and so on. But- but still, he was not completely equal, even such a person as he, who was a -- so, it was very complicated. I don\u2019t know if I expressed myself clearly now."

Be s -- be independent and self-sufficient. And she also meant that if I need now money I can sell something of her jewelry or something of our belongings that I shouldn\u2019t go and ask grandparents, or aunts or uncles or somebody else for help.

So -- and -- and I went to -- to such a person, Skuropskas is his name, he was working, he was a tow toninkas, he belonged to the national party and my mother helped him to escape the -- to save him from deportation, because in some way she -- she told him that he\u2019s in danger.

            "answer": "No, not everybody did it, you know, I would say the whole atmosphere was bad, but not everybody did it, no. Many people were ashamed to do it, it -- it is like, you know, when you say that the Jews were meeting with joi -- the Red army. So, there were some Jews who did it, some were terrified. But -- so the same 1s to say that Lithuanians, some yes, but not all. And then you see the propaganda, the -- the Nazi propaganda, which was taken also over by the LAF-ists, the Lithuanian LAF-ist Skirpa, who had a good intention to -- to have again an independent Lithuania, he thought that maybe Hitler will give him back the independence, but it didn\u2019t happen. It was a big disappointment, of course. But I know that you can\u2019t use any -- you have, you know, this M-Machiavelli, that 1-1f you have a task you can pay any price, this is not valuable in life, it is terrible. So -- and it was, the propaganda was, you see, you are of -- all Jews are communists. It stays very deep in your -- in your con -- in the Lithuanian conscience that -- that they sold you to the Soviet Union, they are your real enemies and therefore you have to kill them like parasites. So you -- and I am absolutely sure that many Lithuanians really took revenge for their deported -- and it could happen that for instance, when their family or somebody was deported, some -- some of the people who came to deport was -- could be also a Jew. There were not many of them, but still, 1t could happen. This is why th -- you should never generalize. So it was like absolute belief that the Jews are your enemies, that the Jews are communists, the Jews sold your cu -- sold your country and there were maybe people who believed that they are killing the enemies. And only later it came -- of course there were people among the killers who wanted to become richer, who wanted the -- there were different people. It\u2019s complicated, but 1-in the beginning it was really that. And it\u2019s very interesting, one lawyer from Solvakia, he told me how, after the beginning of the war, the Jews, I think it was in VilkaviSkis, they were collected and brought into the kazaram, you know, where the -- the -- the -- the soldiers live. And everybody was asked who he 1s and -- and they wanted to get from them, I don\u2019t know, the men -- men, maybe men. And then one Jew was somehow -- wasn\u2019t obedient, and they shot him. And they were so afraid that they did it. And they have hidden him in -- in somewhere, buried him in a secret place, because they were afraid that tomorrow will come a [indecipherable] and will accuse them that they killed a person. But nothing happened, nobody came. So it was absolute free. You could kill a Jew, you could kill him like a fly. Nothing would happen to you. So -- and then it 1s e -- it -- it -- 1t -- it comes like a -- I don\u2019t know, it was a terrible atmosphere of hatred. You can\u2019t -- it\u2019s described in literature, it 1s -- it doesn\u2019t last for very long, but it 1s there and they have to pay a very high price for that."

And -- and once -- I will tell you later on about this orphan home, but Pranas, there came his friends one evening and brought a book, Van Gogh reproductions. And I was -- I liked very much Van Gogh, and my mother liked very much Van Gogh, I knew him. And when I saw this book, I forgot who I am, and I said oh, this is Van Gogh, so wonderful. And then they all looked what kind of girl from the countryside is it who knows who is Van Gogh, because then you haven\u2019t had so many, you know, books of reproductions as we have now. So -- and it became a little bit dangerous to stay there because they were all very good people, but you know, sometimes when they got drunk, they got -- they were talking too much. And also, he was engaged to a woman from Siauliai, Janni, who of course didn\u2019t know that I lived there, and some rumors came that a young girl lives with him, so she got a little bit like jealous and wanted to find out who is this girl, so I had to disappear from this house.

And Marcella Kubilutai also in this house, which arranged my -- me to work there. But registered I was, in Pranas\u2019s house.

To -- to -- th -- and then I will -- if I escape, I prove that I am Jewish, that I have to be afraid of something.

So, because it was terrible for me to think that somebody will, because of me, you know, be punished, or suffer. So I decided not to run away.

And I hear already like, you know, the -- the shoes, the boots coming in and the director, dor -- Dr. [indecipherable] with the -- with, I think, three Gestapo people are coming in.

I wouldn\u2019t say that it was the best time I had, but okay. And one day Gestapo came in and was searching the flat. And I was -- my bed was in a sandylukas, how -- in a storage room, and was behind different stuff, was a bed. But when you open the door you can\u2019t see, you see only different stuff. And the Gestapo came in and they opened the door, but they didn't go farther, they saw it\u2019s a storage place and they didn\u2019t find me. But the very moment they get -- got out, I had to get out from the other -- from the other door. So -- and I couldn\u2019t come back because it was really very threatening. Somebody probably already denounced or something like that. So I went again to the sister of [indecipherable]. And then in a day, or maybe even faster, they found for me a place, and so I got to the family of my second mother, really. This is Stephania Ledugania, you can see her beautiful face. He is a book we were pub -- we published recently about her. She was absolutely outstanding personality, she had six children and -- and she took me as the seventh. And she was, I can\u2019t tell you what kind of person she was. And we became with her friends from the first day, and I would like to remember several little things. When I came in there, I was brought in by [indecipherable] Strimitis, she introduced me as a an orphan and now I will be the sister of her children. And she invited me for a evening meal. And of course she had also very little to eat, but a little bit more than in the ghetto, of course. And her husband was a Lithuanian general, he was already arrested and killed by the Soviets. She didn't know that, but she learned later, but he was arrested immediately, in \u00b041, when -- in \u201940, when the Soviets came. And -- and when she -- and she had such a -- agi-aginyeta. She was a housewife who was cooking, and we had for this evening meal screelai. This is made out such things of -- of flour with a little bit fat on it. And what I noticed that she has put in my -- into my plate a little bit more than she has given to her own children. So I was almost crying. I was really very hungry. I-In this orphan home -- I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m a little bit jumping, but I am proud of it, I was feeding the -- the -- the children who were also more than one years old, and they would go -- get every day such a little plate with manakasha, how 1s it -- I d -- I don\u2019t remember how it\u2019s in English.

And every spoon was a fight with myself. I wanted to put it the mouth, but I had to put it in the mouth of the child. And the children, like devils were also very hungry. They wanted to eat, they never left a spoon for me to eat. Sometimes soup was some leftovers, but the manakasha, never. And so I thought after the war I will eat only manakasha with milk. It was my dream. But okay, I was very hungry, so you can imagine what it meant to me that she has put a little bit more, and nobody -- nobody -- nobody noticed, but I noticed. And then at 10 o\u2019clock in the evening, ev -- everybody went to bed, and she had this habit, she was going to -- to every child. We were -- three of her children were -- three were out of the -- living in different places, they were already more adults, and three were with -- with -- so we were four. And she went to everybody to give a kiss, and then she came to me. I was in the bed, sleeping in a bed in a dark room without windows, where her son, who was taken to Germany for work was sleeping before. And she came and she kissed me and told me goodnight. And then I try -- then it really -- I broke out with such a almost hysterical cry. And this is what I wanted to tell you, how you can be indoctrinated by atmosphere of hatred. She was shocked, why? She came to kiss me, why am I so crying terribly? And you know, nobody kissed me already, for such a long time. I was all the time in fear. Pranas was very good to me, but he didn\u2019t kiss me, you know, or -- or -- and this -- Maria Meskauskas [indecipherable] was not such a very soft woman. And -- and suddenly she comes like a mother and kisses me. So- and J -- I thought already that -- that -- I thought, how can you kiss a Jewish girl? A Jewish human being? It mu -- I thought that something has to be ugly in me. Something what puts off people because everybody\u2019s hunting me, is hunting every Jew. So why? What is the matter? Something must be wrong with us. So when I told her that, she also started to cry, and -- and we were speaking until four o\u2019clock in the morning, and so -- so this night I really became her daughter, and she my second mother. And we stayed so to th -- she died on my hands with -- with the whole -- whole st -- she has a whole story to tell. But even after the liberation, I stayed in her family because I had nobody. And then she was arrested and taken to Siberia, of course, was already then, but then she still came back and we were always very close. And I think she loved me as well. She was a wonderful, wonderful person. She was a very religious Catholic, but never fanatic. She was a very artistic nature. She loved poetry.

A-A-And she -- so it was a -- a whole story when Vilnius was liberated already, they -- they -- it started to -- not liberated, but the new occupation, but still, I must say for me it was also liberation, because I was not any more afraid for my life. And it was the liberation from Nazis, but we suffered quite -- and I myself suffered quite a lot from the Soviets as well. But -- but still the feeling was that now I can go out, I can -- can go to school and so on. So, when the bombing started it was dangerous because we lived in the center, Traky -- on Traky Street. So she went out to the outskirts of Vilnius, to a friend, Ponas Stabinis, and they wer -- he had a cellar and they would sit there in the cellar, the -- and I wa -- went with them. But then I decided that I have to save -- I -- to do -- have to do something for her. I loved her like I can\u2019t tell you how. And so -- and we lived in -- in th -- in this big, big house and courtyard, we were probably the only Lithuanians there. So -- and all the Poles were around. And the Poles didn\u2019t like too much Lithuanians. And I knew very well that if we will leave at night during the bombing, the flat alone, it will be -- they will take everything away from there. They will break in and loot the -- the -- the flat. So I wanted to -- to -- to save it. Crazy idea, but I wanted. So I went back for the night to Vilnius. I was -- I went to the cellar when it -- when the bombs -- there was also a cellar. And I really saved everything. But it -- but one day, I think it was Sunday, the fight started in the street. So I couldn\u2019t get any more daytime to them. So I got stuck there for a whole week. And the m -- the har -- the street was three times, going from hands to hand, from germ -- from the German Wehrmacht to the Soviet army and -- and back. And there were many events there, which I have seen in the killings of -- of -- of 16 years old soldiers, who just without anything came down the street from Pilimond, were killed by a -- by a German tank. Altogether 13 pen -- people, but one we -- we managed to save from there. But however, it was terrible, and I heard the Poles talking, who is this la -- is she lithua -- 1s she Lithuanian, or is he Jewish -- is she Jewish? And they were not -- and so I thought they want to give me away to the Germans, or what. A-As a Lithuanian they don\u2019t like me either. They wanted to get the key from the flat, I didn\u2019t give it to them. But it was already too hard for me and on Thursday I felt that I can\u2019t take it any more and I packed two suitcases and wanted to go on the other side of Neris, into -- in the outskirt of Vilnius where the family was. But when I had already my -- my suitcases ready, the -- the fight started again, I couldn\u2019t leave. And only on Sunday, when already the Soviet army liberated, then I -- I -- I -- I could get out and a quite famous friend of [indecipherable], Conrad Eskadatskas, he was a -- a -- a com-composer and a -- a conductor and a -- a quite famous musician Lithuania. He came also to see if somebody\u2019s alive and then we went with him to the outskirts of Vilnius to see if they are alive. So this was a terrible walk through a city full of -- full of fire, full of dust, full of dead people. Terrible, terrible. But it was still already a little boat which took us from one side of the Neris to the other. And then we got to meet each other and -- and this was also a moment which I will never forget because she couldn\u2019t forgive her how she -- how she didn\u2019t stop me. It was -- it got quite hard to stop me. I was stubborn, so -- so that she was happy that we are alive and everybody in the family remembers this moment, she was happy that I came back. And then I stayed with her. I went to school immediately and -- and then she was arrested in March \u201946, on the 14\" of March. And I stayed still to the end of the year that the children should finish school. And then we were already spread to different homes, and -- but I was going to all the prisons and -- and bringing her food and taking care, and so --"

            "question": "How Lithuania cope or does not cope with the part of Lithuania in -- in the Holocaust.",
            "answer": "You see, it is a very hard issue, and very unpleasant issue, and you have here to differentiate many things. First of all you should know that in the Soviet times, nothing was really mentioned, and the Holocaust, if it was mentioned, was used mainly only for anti-Fascist propaganda. And you couldn\u2019t even use the word Jew, it was only Soviet citizens and so on. You know that the Soviets destroyed finally the big synagogue in Vilna. They destroyed the famous cemetery. I don\u2019t know if you have seen the -- the last pictures of that, it is really an -- and -- and they build houses and -- and ste -- and -- and steps and so on out of this -- of these stones. So there was nothing, really, and th-the Jewish life didn\u2019t exist as such, almost. Only maybe for some propaganda. And -- and when we became independent and even before the independence, when the Lithuanian revival started, cultural revival and -- and the -- and so on, then also started the Jewish revival and my colleague, Professor Kudaba, here is his picture. An absolute outstanding person. He was the organizer of the Lithuanian Cultural Society, and then, thanks to him all the minorities also organized their cultural societies and the Jewish Cultural Society was organized. And for the first time all the questions came up about the past and -- and about the future. So -- so m -- th-th-this -- th-the situation was really m -- very complicated, complex, and you can understand that a nation who 1s, after being suppressed and occupied for so many years is regaining its independence and want to establish itself in the normal democratic world, it\u2019s not very pleasant to talk about participation in the Holocaust. Also, I must say that it was not very -- it was still, I must say the -- the stereotypes of the -- of the 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s were still alive. That the Jews are traitors, that Jews were communists and so on and so on. So I must say that anti- Semitism and the readiness to face the Holocaust was not a -- a simple question. But I must say that on the official level, our government, and especially I would say Vytautas Landsbergis took all the really decent steps. First of all, the genocide was condemned. The -- one of the first -- it was -- and it has no -- it -- the people who took part in -- in this genocide can\u2019t be -- can\u2019t be [speaks Lithuanian here] I don\u2019t know how to say. They -- they have ever to be, always to be condemned, it doesn\u2019t depend how much time passed away past then. The -- one of the first things the government did was to replace the stones in the -- on the steps of tower of Kaunas, to take all these cemetery stones, gravestones away and put the o -- the other ones, not to go on those [indecipherable] th-the 23\" of September, which was the day of the liquidation of the Vilnius ghetto was announced as the day of genocide, and it was an order to -- to put out all the flags, Lithuanian national flags with -- with a black --"

            "answer": "-- ribbon, yeah. The Jewish cultur -- the Jewish community was recreated and -- and supported. They cemeteries were looked after and m -- I am very proud that my former student, Vito Tostalakis was the first. He was a teacher then, he took his -- his pupils and they went to clean up a cemetery not far away from Vilnius. And killing places were also, bit by bit, together with the Jewish community, they were cleaned and looked after. And of course, Jews got all the rights ar -- citizens and Lithuanians have absolutely equal rights. That --that\u2019s absolutely a matter of fact that I would say that maybe a little bit weaker was the question of conde -- of the trials, you know, this Lileikis and so on, but I must still say that on the official level, everything was -- was quite okay. And m -- on the academic level, the breakthrough started pro-probably from 795, something, \u201996. And I look -- came up and there were, especially our young historians, of middle age historians were ready to face the truth and -- and more and more information came up about the Holocaust. So I th -- and now we have really already a changed situation on the level of the [indecipherable] intellectuals and with -- and not only a civil society is now really a lot participating already in -- in facing this question. You know that Lithuanian in-intelligentsia created the house of memory, which is working 1n this direction and -- and they -- they announced already four times a competition, who were the Jewish neighbors -- for schools."

And so they go back to history [indecipherable] and -- and learning from -- from this terrible history. And I must say that we made now about 700 schools -- 700 teachers are working with the Holoto-caust topics. Holocaust is told in the military s -- academy, and in military schools and the military academy. A lot 1 -- we have a lot of educational centers who are dealing with that -- with that issue. And really hundred, hundred of schools and pupils. We have now, you know, that Adamkus created the commission to investigate crimes of Nazi times and gu -- Nazi crimes and the gulag. And we have their commission which also published and found out a lot. I must say that our genocide center, which was first of all like dealing only with the anti-Soviet movement is now more and more facing also the Holocaust situation. So I would say that on the academic level it is -- and such educational level, there is already a breakthrough and a dialog. A lot is really done. I must also say that when Respublika, for instance, published the article of the chief editor of the newspaper, a terrible article, \u201cWho rules the world?\u201d And the answer was the Jews and the gays. You heard, probably, about this article. So what -- not everybody remembers, but you should remember that the first protest was done by the Lithuanian NGOs, Lithuanian organizations and Lithuanian individuals. And during two days, this protest against Tomkus\u2019s writing was signed by about a hundred organizations, about a hundred individual peoples and much more would sign it if it would -- we would keep -- not me, we -- I didn\u2019t, they didn\u2019t even allowed me to sign because I am Jewish. Only Lithuanians signed it, really. So that on -- organizations, not only individual peoples. So it is really a breakthrough and sometimes you should not forget that it takes time to -- to -- but -- but anti-Semitism is still there and still -- it -- you can\u2019t say that it\u2019s all over."

            "answer": "You see, it -- no, no, no, they -- everybody -- it is hard to recognize, it\u2019s not so easy, but -- but people more and more recognize that some Lithuanians really, they were the executors. Ma -- not always, but mainly. But the initiators of that still were the Germans, the Nazis. And this is also clear.

Then, I must say that the past, the -- the antagonistic past which existed between Christians and Jews also had some role to play.

And you see, being Jewish, and here is really -- this is very important, that -- and I suffered myself, and Jewish people suffered so much from generalization, from accusing. If one Jew is bad, all the Jews are so, and so on and so on. So I can\u2019t do it to anybody, you see. And I think that we have to understand, of course in a different degree, but Lithuanians and the Jews are victims of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact. Lithuanians are also victims, because their deportation to Siberia, the -- the -- the terrible historical period after the second World War, when Lithuania was still fighting for 1ts independence, and of course it is a very controversial moment. But -- but we have to take it also in account. You -- you can\u2019t see only your own suffering, you see? And therefore, I am very happy I did not -- I didn't want to make you a -- a picture that now in Lithuania everything is solved. But a German historian, Joachim Tauber, a very good friend of mine, he told me that in Germany it took 30 years from discussions on the academic level to the conscious of the people to recognize what happened. So, it is also -- we have to be a little bit patient. We can\u2019t -- we can\u2019t, you know, impose this terrible thing, I think it was the biggest tragedy in Lithuanian history, the Holocaust. And I think that for me the Germans, th-the Nazis are even worse enemies than the Soviets, why? Because the -- the Soviets, we were still -- Lithuania could -- could resist the Soviets. And -- and -- and they didn\u2019t take away the honor of the nation. And the Nazis in this -- in those times, they made out of some Lithuanian, killers.

That has to be -- in Israel is had to be memorized forever, but here it can -- it is already a question of -- of the people -- of the local people. And I will tell you, recently I was invited to Siauliai for a talk about tolerance. And I had a big audience, over a hundred people, different people, and you know that Siauliai is a city where Murza 1s located, he is the new Lithuanian neo-Nazi, Lithuanian fascist. And I got a question, I don\u2019t know if you heard about that, that -- that m -- during Christmas, next to the Christmas tree was standing a menorah because last year Hanukah and Christmas was almost the same time. And Murza with his guys came and sir -- oversi -- and -- and crashed this menorah, he was destroying it. So they asked me what I think about that. So I answered them like that. You see -- you understand that I have two identities. I am Jewish and I am Lithuanian citizen. And as a Jew, I wouldn\u2019t even put on the main square, the menorah. I would put the menorah in a place which was maybe a Jewish place or a synagogue, and I would remember and -- and -- th-the day somehow very -- very modest. But as a Lithuanian I would be very happy that the menorah stays next to the tree, because there are no any more Jews here. There are no any more people can light the candle.

            "answer": "There is no other way. You know, Sisyphus, he was pushing the stone up the hill, always knowing that the stone will fall down. But still he did it because he had no other way to live. So I have also no other way to live. And if I can help one soul, one person to get rid of hatred and to get rid of suspicion and -- and understand another -- we -- we speak always all -- we have to understand the other, that we shouldn\u2019t be always treated as the other, but we ourselves are treating very often the others as the others. I can tell you another story of a family, I can even mention the name, it\u2019s William Good, who was jumping out of the Paneru -- Paneru pit, he was shot, but he was alive and he escaped and then he survived, also helped by Christian people, but in the woods. And -- and his wife is also a Polish wil -- a -- a Jew from Vilna, a Polish orient -- more oriented than Lithuanian. And he was also from Vilna and they had a lot of prejudice against Lithuanians because for them -- I understand it also, because after the war I was even asked by people, how can you live in a -- in a country which is soaked with blood, with Jewish blood? So -- and they were so full of -- of -- of I don\u2019t know, fi -- some feelings, anti-Lithuanian feelings. And then I told them that you can\u2019t generalize it. There are such wonderful Lithuanian people. Such wonderful people. And I brought them into a family of wonderful Lithuanian people and they came and they talked and they shared and they were, you know, even crying together. And when we went out, Parella, the wife of William Good told me, Irena, thank you very much. You take from us away the burden of hatred. I think hatred is the most terrible thing."
