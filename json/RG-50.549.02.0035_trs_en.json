            "question": "And did you then -- you were then separated from Mrs. Unstrom?",
            "answer": "We were separated from Mrs. Unstrom, but we found out that she survived and five of her kids drowned. And it was very interesting, there was a trial in Denmark, because we - well, I don\u2019t know, do you want me to talk about that? Well, when we came to -- to Denmark, on May fifth, 1945, Ill never forget the day we were liberated, the war was over, yeah. Actually, the very end of March, it was like maybe the 30th of March, so -- so I was only maybe five weeks later. Five weeks later, du-during that five weeks, before liberation, we didn\u2019t do anything, we were just -- could go on the street. We could -- had to stay in the little town. We could walk around and as long as we came back by dusk. And we were all in this big auditortum and I remember one day we were walking, my sister and I and there was a woman working in the fields and we asked her, \u201cAre there any Jews here?\u201d And she said, \u201cWhen you Germans --\u201d she thought we were Germans -- \u201cWhen you Germans are going to be in concentration camps, the Jews will come back from Sweden.\u201d And we were afraid to start asking her more -- for more information because we thought, at that time, that we were the only two Jews, that we were going to survive. And that was very important to us, because before we got to Mrs. Unstrom, we -- we -- when we first escaped -- you probably have that on the tape, no? When we first escaped, the -- what happened is they took us out of Stutthof. And that was the end of December or the very beginning of January and in that -- that I can say that is because the Christmas trees were still in the people\u2019s homes. So we knew it was around that time. We didn\u2019t know exactly the dates and so forth. And as soon as we wa -- we walk a whole day- my sister was so sick with typhus. By then, already, my mother was taken into the gas chamber. I was with her inside the gas chamber and that, you have that, I\u2019m sure, on the tape. And I had absolutely -- I could hardly walk, but I really had such a strong sense that I wanted to survive, because I felt someone has to tell what happened. Because the mo- most difficult part of it was that we all thought none of us will come out alive and there will be no one to talk about, no one to tell anything, nobody will know. And we all vowed ourselves that we will tell -- whoever survives will remember and we will tell and that\u2019s why I was back a couple of times to Stutthof. It just -- I feel that everybody there was my family, and that I have to go -- as painful as it is, I have to go out to tell. So we -- my sister -- I was dragging her and she keeps saying, \u201cI can\u2019t go on.\u201d She was -- she had Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection typhus. Just right then, she had gotten typhus. And I kept saying, \u201cWe will live, we will live.\u201d And I kept egging on and all of a sudden, the sky opened up and the bombs started to fall and everybody started to run, everybody started to run. And I had no energy. I just fell into a ditch with an -- there was another woman, Luba, who was helping me. She was holding me up. I don\u2019t know who was holding who, we were all three. And we saw a house and we walked across the house and we knocked on the door. And the woman opened up the door and as if she knew we were coming and we were wearing the striped dress with the clogs and [indecipherable] the wind was howling, it was a big storm. And she quickly tore off, and we were now standing naked in front of her -- tore off our clothes and gave us clothing and told to the Russiansaw who was working there, he was a prisoner of war, that we are -- to taken us to the Umschlagplatz to be killed. And that\u2019s where they took all the people, to the Umschlagplatz to be killed. And they gave us some food and oh, I was so sick from just having the first -- you know, real food. And we stayed there a couple of hours, til night time. And h-he sat there and she gave us a shawl and clothes and gave us some food and she told him to take us to the Umschlagplatz. Why she did it -- you know, my sister always says, \u201cYou gave -- give that woman credit that she saved our lives.\u201d And I said, \u201cYeah, because if she hadn\u2019t taken off the clothes from us and if she hasn\u2019t told the soldier to take us, where he saved our lives.\u201d What he did was, we went out and Luba, who could not longer go -- she was much older and we were and she said she was going to remain there. And when I was just back there, I found out that she died and they buried her right there in the farm. And so, anyways, we went with this so -- Russian guy and he said, \u201cI\u2019m not taking you to the Umschlagplatz. What I\u2019m going to do 1s -- is I\u2019m going to -- I\u2019m going to take you to the nearest point where it\u2019s frozen.\u201d It\u2019s called the vikes -- it was called the Vikesel, now it\u2019s the Vistula river. And -- the narrowest point and wi -- and he was on the horse, he was making tracks and we were following him. And he said to call on all our force. If it\u2019s wet, we will drown, because that means that the ice is broken. And we should do it at night so nobody detect us. And all night long, we were crawling across. Th-They just filmed it and the film of there, you know, it was beautiful, you know, in the summer and that. And we got across on the other side and he told us to go to a convent. Th-The nuns w -- an -- but we should say we are not Jewish, we should say --"

Now, it\u2019s Poland, but then it was Germany, was East Germany. So, what happened 1s we -- we -- my name became from Udit -- Uta. Beker is a German name.

            "answer": "The river was frozen. We crawled across the river all night long and we are able to go on the other side. And he said to go to the -- on the other side. The river divided so it was- where Stutthof was, was on one side and da -- and the road -- there is a bridge now that you can go over, is -- but it\u2019s really frozen because they have horses going across, I mean, that particular year, it was frozen. That was also when they attacked Russia and they couldn\u2019t do it, because the winter was so s-severe. And we are talking of the year of 1944 -- \u201845. And so, we -- she -- and we got into the convent. The convent, the nuns were wonderful, they washed us, they bathed us, they took care of us. And my sister\u2019s typhus got better, but I got sick. And they said to us that we cannot -- they cannot keep us. They knew we were Jewish -- that we would have to -- they would have to baptize us. We\u2019d have to convert. And that we didn\u2019t want. It was the most important thing. The more they said they would do it, which in -- few days we decided we will not stay there. We were -- we talk about it now, how foolish we were. But we didn\u2019t know what that meaned, conversion and we, only to survive, to -- wanted to survive as Jews. We wanted to tell the world what happened as Jews. We didn\u2019t want to be Catholics or anything else. So we left and my sister -- and I was very, very sick, the -- again we met another Russian, because the Russian liberated that area and there were lot of fighting and took me to Danzig and left me on the steps of the hospital. And my sister said, \u201cYou can\u2019t say a word, you s -- you\u2019re stoom, you\u2019re no -- no -- don\u2019t make -- you know, don\u2019t talk.\u201d And she, without realizing it, crossed the bridge and went back to the same place near there -- near Stutthof, without realizing it. Because when I was just there, I\u2019ve realize how close it is to Stutthof. She went to the bridge and they told her that there is a place there -- she didn\u2019t know from Wehrmacht, from what, you know, she didn\u2019t know of that -- that they are looking for work -- that they need workers. So, we wen -- she worked -- went into a Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Wehrmacht station, which is -- you know, the German army, where they get all their -- and thats was Mrs. Unstrom, that\u2019s what she had. She had this huge, huge house and she was running like a hotel, or -- you know, for -- a stopover for the Wehrmacht -- for the German army to come. And when we worked -- and then, when I get better, she came and -- and got me back to the -- to the house where she worked. And it happened so fast, it happened within weeks, with the period of week. I was in the hospital, I think, for two weeks. She came and picked me up and we were there maybe 10 days on that farm and then we sailed for Denmark.

First we had to take off whatever we had, our clothes and everything and -- and just throw it in the piles. And [ll never forget when I first came in, the piles of shoes and combs and toothbrushes and you name it, they had it there. And I kept saying to my mother, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d And she said, \u201cT have no answer.\u201d And then they told us to get undressed. The first one to get undressed was my mother. When I think of how many times she had to stand naked in front of those beasts. She was such a beautiful, religious woman, gorgeous woman and had to be just like this, before they even killed you. What -- the humiliation that -- having to see what they are doing to her children. So my mother and my sister and my mother, she had gold denture, they just simply yanked it out. And her whole face was full of blood. And they threw her a striped dress, the Kapo lady threw a dress and a pair of clogs and pushed her on the side. And then my sister and then me.

And then they continued cutting it and that and my whole head was full of blood. Then, the next one had to get undressed, her name is Hava. And my sister -- my daughter is an artist and she has paintings going around, all over the country and she has a painting about this. S -- It\u2019s about stories my mother told me and she depict this Hava so incredible. And when I went back to -- to Stutthof, Hava is always with me. I\u2019Il tell you why. Hava got undressed, she was wearing a loose dress. And when she -- by the way, when my mother got undressed, my mother had sewn 1n, in her -- a pouch in my sister\u2019s and mine, like little pouches. She didn\u2019t even let us know she did that. She put it -- sewed it in, because she thought -- there was some rings, there was diamond rings, some watch, some jewelry and some rings and whatever she had, so she put it in, she cushioned it. When we took it out, it fell all over and we never got it. Hava took off her dress and a little baby fell out. The baby -- I -- a tiny, little baby, because gave such a little squeak and he picked up the baby and he threw it. And -- the commandant. And, so those are the memory when I went to Stutthof, Hava. So, anyways, whens -- we got into the bunk -- to the barrack, and my mother was on top and I was in the middle with Hava, my mother was on top with my sister Rachel. And Hava would rub my -- like this with her fist, my hand. And I would say to her, \u201cWhat do you have in your fist?\u201d And she never answered. And we would all say, \u201cHava, what do you have? What do you have?\u201d She had a little baby\u2019s shoes, when they took -- and because she wouldn\u2019t give up the shoe, they took her out. We all had to stand outside and watch and they put a bullet through her head. So that\u2019s Hava\u2019s story. And I have to tell it, because there\u2019s nobody else for her to talk. I\u2019m sorry. [indecipherable |"

We parked the car at a distance. And I went to Sarah and Horace Baker, I -- I have lost contact since, with them. In fact, they are going to try to have a reunion with all of us when I\u2019m there, in Philadelphia. And from then on, I called up the lady who was doing the panel was Lois Stalvy, and I said to her, \u201cLois, I want to be on the panel.\u201d And I started speaking out what was happening to me, that ultimately this was going to be the result. And we spoke all over, all over. I\u2019ll never forget when I went to Columbia, Maryland, which was a brand new town that was just built. And we were refused -- I was there with two African American women -- was refused to be served, the guy would not serve us. And I walked up to him in my broken English and -- I mean, my English, I told him, you know, \u201cWe\u2019re waiting long, where is the food?\u201d And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t have tea, coffee, or anything for the likes like you.\u201d And I walked up and I remember having the water -- glasses of water, spilled out the water and I just -- and walked out. I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. We don\u2019t need this white trash.\u201d And I -- you know, and I walked out. Said it loud enough that everybody turned around. Then I made a statement. And I went on and I felt that the Civil Rights movement was a si -- a time in my life that I felt -- this was before even Martin Luther King, that it was a very, very scary, that this is going to happen all over again. There were riots. There were all kinds of things that this is happening in the United States. I knew very little about the United States, even though I\u2019ve lived here already a few years. I -- I had just become a citizen -- I had just become a citizen. It was -- Nixon was running for office. I was -- and he lost, the first time he [indecipherable]."

The most difficult part was my son didn\u2019t have a high number and I was worried -- terribly worried about -- of him being drafted. E -- E -- I had sleepless nights about it. My brother and my sister live in Canada and you know there were a lot of people who went to Canada. And I was literally, if it didn\u2019t stopped, I was thinking of moving back to Canada, cause I just could not deal with that. And the scary part of the -- became even worse is when the Kent State- [remember when the Kent State, with the shootings at Kent State, it was devastated. It was very scary time. The new left movement, I didn\u2019t have that much of -- didn\u2019t -- busy. The sexual revolution is -- the drugs and so forth. I think it was scary for me, the drug situation, because here I was with two teenagers and I remember the kids used to love to come to my house, his friends. And my son is -- played basketball and he was on the varsity team, so all the kids would come. And rather than him going down to north Philadelphia in a very not good neighborhood, we had a basketball court put in and he Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection would play at home. And I remember baking pies so they would all come in. And [Il never forget this instance. I was running for my second job, teaching at congregation B\u2019nai Brith. [indecipherable] congregation B\u2019nai Brith, [indecipherable] on congregation in Philadelphia. And my daughter and my son, they were home and then there were like four of Black kids who were playing basketball with him, who were on -- from Central High School.

And she said, \u201cAre you kidding, you\u2019re going out and you\u2019re leaving four Black kids with Michael and Debbie?\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d She would not leave her daughter and that\u2019s why I remember I was devastated. Here is -- I trust my kids, in my own home. They were -- they are all the time in my house, I trusted them and here is -- she\u2019s trying to tell me that I\u2019m doing something wrong. And nothing happened. My kids grew up in a very well integrated neighborhood of west Mount Airy. And I think they are better off, because they are better human beings today. They are very involved in their own communities, wherever they live and I\u2019m grateful that I gave them that kind of home to live in. So, the drug scene was very scared for me and I would say to them, \u201cIf you are caught and smoking marijuana,\u201d -- which was that time, marijuana, \u201cand you\u2019re arrested, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to bail you out. I work hard enough just to make you regular, decent human beings and if it\u2019s against the law, then you shouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d I knew nothing about it and so forth. And so that\u2019s -- that was it, you know, but thank God, my kids, I don\u2019t know if they ever smoked marijuana or not, but I -- they\u2019ve never been in trouble with the law, thank God. The feminist movement I had a hard time understanding. I Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 1 couldn\u2019t deal with, but I felt that because I was a single mother, I felt I should get equal pay for what I did, for that I worked hard for it. I remember the assassination of Medgar Evers and I was devastated. How it could happen them, because he was by then, a real name in every community. And John F. Kennedy, I -- I felt that we will never know what he -- kind of president he would have been, died too young and too violent. And Martin Luther King, he was -- he became my children\u2019s hero."

I thought when the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum was Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection established, I thought that was the greatest thing that happened.

It was just incredible that we had a state. In 1947, Israel was partitioned by the UN, to live side by side, that\u2019s what right now is going on, but they want to live side by side. 21 nations, surrounding Arab nation declared war on Israel and Israel was isolated and fought that war and it so ironically, now we are -- right now, we are fighting -- they want the same thing what happened. But look what happened. The Arab nation -- the League of Arab Nations, said to all the Arabs, \u201cFlee. Leave Israel and go fight against Israel.\u201d And Israel said, Ben-Gurion said, \u201cStay, you will live side by side with us.\u201d But they didn\u2019t.

The worst part is to be sent into the area, to the occupied area, because children, they are fighting and children throw stones and stones kill. So it\u2019s not a real war, but it\u2019s there and I think that the only way that it\u2019s going to be -- peace will come, 1s if Yasser Arafat outlaws Hamas and all the rhetoric of hatred and then Israel does the same thing of hatred against, but -- but Israel don\u2019t go and blow buses up with children. They may use harsh words, but they don\u2019t blow up buses with children -- with innocent children. Hamas and the Palestinians have -- I don\u2019t [indecipherable] say the Palestinians, they\u2019ve been blowing up -- how do you negotiate peace with a suicide bomber? You can\u2019t. You can -- you can do it with a leader, but a suicide bomber only knows one thing. He\u2019s going to kill themselves, because he\u2019s going to go to heaven and blows up, yeah. It\u2019s wrong for Israel to blow up houses, too, if they find that they have been members of Hamas or something. It\u2019s wrong in both side. But still, I think that the most difficult thing that I think 1s happening is, that if -- that nothing is going to happen until this hatred -- you don\u2019t have to love each other, but you have to be able to tolerate each other, to live side by side. But if you\u2019re going to have nothing but hatred, it\u2019s not going to happen. I don\u2019t know, what do you think?"
