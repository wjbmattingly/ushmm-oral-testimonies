I think the city itself was \u2014 had a population of about two and a half million, and about 200,000 were Jewish. And so apparently the people that came from the same areas in the \u2014 eastern Europe, because the Hapsburg Empire at that time was really large, before the first World War, and encompassed much of western Poland, and Czechoslovakia and went as far as down to northern \u2014 what later became northern Italy. And so there was a lot of social activity going on, and I Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Fred Lorber \u00b0 December 2, 2011 really don\u2019t quite know how they really met. All I knew that I was a child that really be \u2014 that came in 1923, so the war was over in 1918, so this was a very difficult economic time, and I \u2014 not very much was talked about on how they met, and I really never found out."

And most of the Jewish populations in these small cities, either had a chayder, which was a religious school, where things were taught in Hebrew and in Yiddish.

At that time there were small, and I think it then continued also in the United States, there were little, itty-bitty storefronts, which functioned at high holidays, and a rabbi somehow, he was \u2014 had another job, and then he conducted services at Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur; the two, you know, very important Jewish holidays. And they were sometimes held at a storefront. But we belonged to a conservative synagogue in Vienna when I was growing up. I don\u2019t know what the sh \u2014 really religious affiliations were before I was born. I just never really \u2014 was so, I guess involved with the present time, and changes that took place culturally, and language- wise, and new locations, and all the things that took place that I think that the inquisitiveness was not there to find out how all these things really came to be."

I still remember it because I wa \u2014 I participated in a ski race, and I won kind of a little trophy, and I was very proud of it, and I \u2014 but by the second run or whatever it is, I ken \u2014I had a bad fall, or whatever it was, and I kind of dislocated my thumb, and I remember that. So, when my parents picked me up at the railroad station, coming back from that school vacation, they seemed at edge, and explained to me that things were not doing very well. They had received information and in contact with some friends or relatives in Germany \u2014 and as you know, Hitler took over 1933, and at that time, the Nuremberg laws, which this qualified and you know, makes the Jews of Germany not only second class, but third and fourth class citizens and they lost their jobs, particularly if they were government jobs, or sensitive jobs like movies, or livit \u2014 or publishing and things like that, the discrimination really was beginning to really hurt in Germany, and my parents were very much aware of it. So when I di \u2014 they picked me up and I still remember they picked me up at a \u2014 at the railroad station and on the way home were telling me what was going on politically in Interview with Fred Lorber _ December 2, 2011 Austria at that time. And it was, if you go back into history, there was a chancellor of Austria, his name was Schuschnigg, and he represented the \u2014 kind of a little bit of a also \u2014I would say little bit a of a dictatorship, but not as strongly as what the Nazis had. He represented the Christian Austrian Christian party, which was the \u2014 the Conservative party. Vienna\u2019s representation was more social democratic, and my father was involved in the social democratic party. And at that time there were all kinds of demonstrations in Vienna. The Nazis had become determined again that they were, since 1934 the Nazi party was outlawed in Germany \u2014 in Austria, because they had tri-tried to have a putsch, and overthrow the government. They killed Dollfuss, who was a chancellor, in tr \u2014 in trying to do it, but that was aborted, and the Austrian government was able to arrest and \u2014 and kill some of the people who tried to overthrow the government, and this \u2014 and that time outlawed the Nazi party. So, in 1938, the beginning, the negotiations were going on between the pr \u2014 the president of Austria and Hitler. He would summon him \u2014 Hitler would summon him to Berchtesgaden and really threaten him with all kinds of bad things, and scream at him, and was looking to annex Austria to Germany. And the guy stood firm, Schuschnigg did, for a while. So all this demonstration of voting for annexation to Austria, or Austria re-remaining independent, took place in the beginning of 1938. Some of the negotiations that took place which \u2014 in Austria and Interview with Fred Lorber ie December 2, 2011 Germany, that Austria submitted to Germany, and let some people, Nazis, out of prison, and \u2014 and also appointed them to certain key jobs within the Austrian government. Seyss-Inquart was one of them, and I don\u2019t quite remember what names of the other people that became like the commissioner of safety, and some other tr \u2014 cabinets \u2014 j-jobs, and it really did not look very well for the independence of Austria at that time. I know a lot of street demonstrations in which my father had participated."

He was a faker, you know, but he wrote the books that to this very day are very popular, a hundred years later, still very popular in Germany. It\u2019s all about America, the American west, Indians and trappers and the whole thing. So I was big fan of that. As a matter of fact, once one of my teachers asked my mom to come to school because te \u2014 she felt I was reading too many of those books. So I had that little adventure seed planted into me.

Be \u2014 was that somebody had re \u2014 a relative in \u2014 in New York, and \u2014 who had money, or was willing to help this person living in Vienna who had no money. So they would say if \u2014 if the official exchange of marks \u2014 used to be shillings and then it became German marks, was five marks to the d \u2014 10 marks to the dollar \u2014 I\u2019ve forgotten what the exchange rate was, the black market would pay 20 marks to a person in \u2014 1n Vienna, instead of 10. So it paid for the relative to deal to that black market, or whatever it was called, to that conduit. And so if you had money and you lived in Vienna, and you \u2014 there were Jewish people who had no money, and they need to buy groceries. And they had relatives that would give \u2014 who would contribute some money. So that\u2019s why I think \u2014 where the money flow went, back and forth.

His father became the concertmaster at the \u2014 which is the first chair in the orchestra \u2014 at the Metropolitan Opera Company. And so we went to the opera very often, for free. And became kind of a steady guy at the Metropolitan Opera \u2014 that\u2019s when they were still down on 1407, which is 1407 Broadway, and then they moved uptown to Lincoln Center, and we did \u2014 I still remember going, how amazed we were [indecipherable] opera company, Irving and I did. We were \u2014 became very good fre \u2014 I gotta tell you a quick anec \u2014 ac \u2014 anecdote. Not anecdote, thing that happened to him and me. When the war ended, I moved up from Italy into \u2014 of \u2014 U-USF \u2014 US \u2014 US force \u2014 USFA. US Forces in Austria. They apparently went through my \u2014 through, you know, my \u2014 every G.I. had that IBM card. I didn\u2019t have it, but they had it. We traveled with trucks 1n the wors \u2014 in worse environments, that had the first machines, IBM cards, they were \u2014 had holes in them. And they had these machines in the trucks, they\u2019re big, big \u2014 they were Interview with Fred Lorber _ December 8, 2011 very big semis.

So if they want to pull the \u2014 that the army wanted to pull you up, because looking for certain specialties that people may have, they would somehow run these cards through these machines, and itll come up. So, when the war ended, my outfit was moved \u2014 was going to be moved back to the States, but then they redirected it to Japan \u2014 not to Japan, but to the Pacific. So, I got pulled out, and I always wondered how \u2014 why didn\u2019t I go with my outfit? So apparently my Viennese birth and my German knowledge, I landed up in US Forces in Austria, on the mar \u2014 on the [indecipherable]. Then, he was the commanding general of the campaign in \u2014 in Italy, that went from the bottom of the boot all the way up to the Po River, where I served all my military overseas. So then my friend Irving wrote the book about the campaign, the Italian campaign. So, I-I find myself pulled out and sent to a staging area and then I get orders that I am now part of USFA ma \u2014 US Forces in Austria. So I am the only really Viennese person in a contingent of about 200 - 300 G.L.s that will make the invasion back in \u2014 not invasion, but because the Russians got there before us, but reoccupation of Vienna.
