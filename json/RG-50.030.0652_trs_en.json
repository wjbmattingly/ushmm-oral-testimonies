I think the city itself was \u0152 had a population of about two and a half million, and about 200,000 were Jewish. And so apparently the people that came from the same areas in the \u0152 eastern Europe , because the Hapsburg Empire at that time was really large, before the first World War, and encompassed much of western Poland , and Czechoslovakia and went as far as down to northern \u0152 what later became northern Italy. And so there was a lot of so cial activity going on, and I Interview with Fred Lorber December 2, 2011 5really don\u2122t quite know how they really met. All I knew that I was a child that really be \u0152 that came in 1923, so the war was ove r in 1918, so this was a very difficult economic time, and I \u0152 not very much was talked about on ho w they met, and I really never found out."

And most of the Jewish populations in these small cities, either had a chayder, which was a religious school, wher e things were taught in Hebrew and in Yiddish.

At that time there were small, and I think it then continued also in the United States, there were little, itty-bitty storefronts, which functioned at high holidays, and a rabbi somehow, he was \u0152 had another job, and then he conducted services at Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur; the two, you know, very important Jewish holidays. And they were sometimes held at a storefront. But we belonged to a conservative synagogue in Vienna when I was growing up. I don\u2122 t know what the sh \u0152 really religious affiliations were before I was born.

They had received information and in contact with some friends or relatives in Germany \u0152 and as you know, Hitler took over 1933, and at that time, the Nuremberg laws, which this qualified and you know, makes the Jews of Germany not only second class, but third and fourth class citizens and they lost their jobs, particularly if they were government jobs, or sensitive jobs like movies, or livit \u0152 or publishing and things like th at, the discrimination really was beginning to really hurt in Germany, and my parents were very much aware of it. So when I di \u0152 they picked me up and I still remember they picked me up at a \u0152 at the railroad station and on the way home were telling me what was going on politically in Interview with Fred Lorber December 2, 2011 15Austria at that time. And it was, if you go b ack into history, there was a chancellor of Austria, his name was Schuschnigg , and he represented the \u0152 kind of a little bit of a also \u0152 I would say little bit a of a dictatorship, but not as strongly as what the Nazis had. He represented the Christian Austrian Christian party, which was the \u0152 the Conservative party. Vienna\u2122s representation was more social democratic, and my father was involved in the social democratic party. And at that time there were all kinds of demonstrations in Vienna. The Nazis had become determined again that they were, since 1934 the Nazi party was outlawed in Germany \u0152 in Austria, because they had tri-tried to have a putsch, and overthrow the government. They killed Dollfuss, who was a chancellor, in tr \u0152 in trying to do it, but that was aborted, and the Austrian government was able to arrest and \u0152 and kill some of the people who tried to overthrow the government, and this \u0152 and that time outlawed the Nazi party. So, in 1938, the beginning, the nego tiations were going on between the pr \u0152 the president of Austria and Hitler. He would summon him \u0152 Hitler would summon him to Berchtesgaden and really threaten him with all kinds of bad things, and scream at him, and was looking to annex Austria to Germany. And the guy stood firm, Schuschnigg did, for a while. So all this demonstration of voting for annexation to Austria, or Austria re-remaining independent, took place in the beginning of 1938. Some of the negotia tions that took place which \u0152 in Austria and Interview with Fred Lorber December 2, 2011 16Germany, that Austria submitted to Germany, and let some people, Nazis, out of prison, and \u0152 and also appointed them to certain key jobs w ithin the Austrian government. Seyss-Inquart was one of them, and I don\u2122t quite remember what names of the other people that became like the commissioner of safety, and some other tr \u0152 cabinets \u0152 j-jobs, and it really did not look very well for the independence of Austria at that time. I know a lot of street demonstrations in which my father had participated."

And we stopped in Berlin for a week, and they had an ex \u0152 they had a special exhibition at one of the museums, the city museum of Berlin, of Karl May. He was a faker, you know, but he wrote the books that to this very day are very popular, a hundred years later, still very popular in Germany. It\u2122s all about America, the American west, Indians and trappers and the whole thing. So I was big fan of that. As a matter of fact , once one of my teachers asked my mom to come to school because te \u0152 she felt I was reading too many of those books. So I had that little adventure seed planted into me. So it became a game to me a little bit, of avoiding being \u0152 you know, meeting some one that \u0152 with whom I would have a confrontation. And having \u0152 and living in an area wh ich there were mostly non-Jews. I was used to that, and the people were somewhat protective of us wher-where we lived.

So it paid for the relative to deal to that black market, or whatever it was called, to that conduit. And so if you had money and you lived in Vienna, and you \u0152 there were Jewish people who had no money, and they need to buy groceries.

His father became the concertmaster at the \u0152 which is the first chair in the orchestra \u0152 at the Metropolitan Opera Company. And so we went to the opera very often, for free. And became kind of a steady guy at the Metropolitan Opera \u0152 that\u2122s when they were still down on 1407, which is 1407 Broadway, and then they moved uptown to Lincoln Center , and we did \u0152 I still remember going, how amazed we were [indecipherable] opera company, Irving and I did. We were \u0152 became very good fre \u0152 I gotta tell you a quick anec \u0152 ac \u0152 anecdote. Not anecdote, thing that happened to him a nd me. When the war ended, I moved up from Italy into \u0152 of \u0152 U-USF \u0152 US \u0152 US force \u0152 USFA. US Forces in Austria. They apparently went through my \u0152 through, you know, my \u0152 every G.I. had that IBM card. I didn\u2122t have it, but they had it. We traveled with trucks in the wors \u0152 in worse environments, that had the first machines, IBM cards, they were \u0152 had holes in them. And they had these machines in the trucks, they \u2122re big, big \u0152 they were Interview with Fred Lorber December 8, 2011 110very big semis. And \u0152 a nd you \u0152 all your \u0152 your record and who you are, your names, your schooling, your I.Q., whatever you did, was on that one card, it had holes in it. So if they want to pull the \u0152 that the army wanted to pull you up, because looking for certain specialties that people may have, they would somehow run these cards through these machines, and it\u2122ll come up. So, when the war ended, my outfit was moved \u0152 was going to be moved back to the States, but then they redirected it to Japan \u0152 not to Japan, but to the Pacific. So, I got pulled out, and I always wondered how \u0152 why didn\u2122t I go with my out fit? So apparently my Viennese birth and my German knowledge, I landed up in US Forces in Austria, on the mar \u0152 on the [indecipherable]. Then, he was the commanding general of the campaign in \u0152 in Italy, that went from the bottom of the boot all the way up to the Po River, where I served all my military overseas. So then my friend Irving wrote the book about the campaign, the Italian campaign. So, I-I find myself pulled out and sent to a staging area and then I get orders that I am now part of USFA ma \u0152 US Forces in Austria. So I am the only really Viennese person in a contingent of about 200 - 300 G.I.s that will make the invasion back in \u0152 not invasion, but because the Russians got there before us, but reoccupation of Vienna.
