            "answer": "Certainly in the area that I grew up in because it was a -- what we call a mixed area. There were Jews, there were French, there were Italians, and -- in fact, it was almost a -- a conglomeration of just every -- every language there was spoken. And as a result, actually when I was younger, I spoke some of the other languages, too. I learned how to speak a little Hungarian and a little bit of Italian, which makes it easier because Romanian and Italian are pretty much aligned. And under those circumstances even as a youngster, we went to each other\u2019s homes and so forth and heard it spoken because that\u2019s what most people spoke at that time. And, oh, we were at that time, foreigners. My father had ra -- come here, as I said, working in the steel mills and when the war broke out and -- first World War, he volunteered to go and he was in the American expeditionary force, and when the war was over he automatically became a citizen. And he was still a young man, he was only in his 20\u2019s and decided to go back to Romania and find somebody to marry. And he met my mother and they had a -- a courtship that lasted a short period of time, and he got married there in Romania and came here, and brought her with him. And s -- at the time that she came to this country, she was pregnant and I was born -- she got here in February and I was born in March, in 1925. I can always say I was conceived there and dedicated here. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I don\u2019t think there was any distinction back in those days a-about being a Hebrew or a Jew or whatever it was. And you were Greek or you were Italian, that\u2019s fine.

And -- but decided at that time -- the decision, that is, was left to me by my parents as to whether I wanted to stay there or whether I wanted to come back here and I chose to come back here, wanting to be back in -- in America, and from then on it was just here."

And whatever it was that I did, it didn\u2019t make any big difference. I always leaned toward being a doctor, and my father said, if that\u2019s what you want to be, that\u2019s fine, go ahead, let\u2019s -- but you\u2019ve got to excel in school and -- and this was the time. And of course the depression held things back considerably during that time.

And he was quite happy that I had decided not to stay there because that\u2019s when Hitler was rising in his power and he said, this man is evil.

And as I\u2019ve mentioned earlier, I -- the people claimed that they didn\u2019t know what was going on, but you could smell the camp from miles away, because they had crematoriums and they would incinerate some of the people that they had, once they died, and some of them that hadn\u2019t even died yet, for that matter. I understand that they were functioning at full blast when the camp was captured, and that they were trying to clear their -- their rooms in the crematorium, and there were some of -- of them that were still alive, and they were just pushing them into the -- into the furnaces while they were still alive. So we knew a little bit about what was going on there. Then when we walked in to see it, to see that there was a -- a basement underneath the crematorium in which they had big hooks, like sky hooks on the wall, and they had bodies that were hung on these sky hooks and they would hang them there until they either died or what happened to them, and then put them on an elevator and send them up to the crematorium, and there dispose of them by burning them. And the stench, as I said, was -- why these people didn\u2019t know something was happening there was beyond me.

And the reason I did come to this particular area is because before I went overseas I was stationed at Fort Mead. And when I had got leave while I was stationed at Fort Mead, I came into this area and came into Arlington, and I loved This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Arlington was just gorgeous. Still is, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t was just gorgeous. I said, one of these days I\u2019m going to live there. And that\u2019s what I did, I came here. There was one other neurosurgeon here and we went into partnership together and everybody in the District of Columbia kept saying, what are you -- what are you going over there, that\u2019s on the other side of the river. Nothing is every going to happen there. So the thing that happened 1s we built all these hospitals and I was the founder of Fairfax Hospital, the founder of Northern Virginia Doctor\u2019s Hospital. The founder of National Orthopedic Hospital. So we built our own hospitals and we -- w -- and it -- 1t -- 1t was quite nice and had a nice practice, and I practice in what -- what I refer to as the golden age of medicine, where there was no Medicare or Medicaid and not everybody was entitled to everything under God\u2019s creation. They got treated free in most of my practice. Back early on, 40 percent of it was gratis, it -- it was free patients, so -- but I made my first dollar when I was about 36 years old. And everybody says, boy, it takes a long time to be a neurosurgeon. It does. And I think it\u2019s going to be even longer, they\u2019re going to make it longer."

I wasn\u2019t -- when I came back from the service - | -- I went into the service as a young college boy that probably had a beanie on his head. I came back from the service as a mature man that never belonged to a -- a fraternity or anything like that, because that was a lot of bunk, as we felt coming back. So we set up our own organizations. But I think that my entire wartime experience gave me a sense of understanding of what man can do to man. What -- what had happened in Germany should never happen again, and I understand that it\u2019s been happening in some of these other countries, in Africa and otherwise.
