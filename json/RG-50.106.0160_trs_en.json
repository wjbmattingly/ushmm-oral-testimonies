            "answer": "Certainly in the area that I grew up in because it was a -- what we call a mixed area. There were Jews, there were French, there were Italians, and -- in fact, it was almost a -- a conglomeration of just every -- every language there was spoken. And as a result, actually when I was younger, I spoke some of the other languages, too. I learned how to speak a little Hungarian and a little bit of Italian, which makes it easier because Romanian and Italian are pretty much aligned. And under those circumstances even as a youngster, we went to each other\u2019s homes and so forth and heard it spoken because that\u2019s what most people spoke at that time. And, oh, we were at that time, foreigners. My father had ra -- come here, as I said, working in the steel mills and when the war broke out and -- first World War, he volunteered to go and he was in the American expeditionary force, and when the war was over he automatically became a citizen. And he was still a young man, he was only in his 20\u2019s and decided to go back to Romania and find somebody to marry. And he met my mother and they had a -- a courtship that lasted a short period of time, and he got married there in Romania and came here, and brought her with him. And s -- at the time that she came to this country, she was pregnant and I was born -- she got here in February and I was born in March, in 1925. I can always say I was conceived there and dedicated here. Interview with John Bucur : August 18, 2003"

I don\u2019t think there was any distinction back in those days a-about being a Hebrew or a Jew or whatever it was. And you were Greek or you were Italian, that\u2019s fine.

            "answer": "Oh, I have some nice, fond thoughts of my elementary school because in the fourth grade I had the teacher named McLaughlin who was very fond of me and I was a good student and she challenged me in more ways than one, in the work that I was doing because I got special work over and above what she taught the general class, because it was such a mixed group. And it was at that time that my mother and I went to visit Europe and this teacher encouraged it, even though I was going to be Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with John Bucur \u00b0 August 18, 2003 absent for a period of time, and encouraged it very strongly and wa -- I wrote to her and we communicated during the time I was gone. As a result though, I was gone about a year and a half and went to school there, 1-in Romania, so going back to the - my parent\u2019s homes. And -- but decided at that time -- the decision, that is, was left to me by my parents as to whether I wanted to stay there or whether I wanted to come back here and I chose to come back here, wanting to be back in -- in America, and from then on it was just here."

And whatever it was that I did, it didn\u2019t make any big difference. I always leaned toward being a doctor, and my father said, if that\u2019s what you want to be, that\u2019s fine, go ahead, let\u2019s -- but you\u2019ve got to excel in school and -- and this was the time. And of course the depression held things back considerably during that time.

In the meantime, go do something else. So I was -- that was something that really stood me in good stead. I recall that specifically because of -- of how it came about. And most of the things that I -- that I wanted as a youngster, being an only child, I got on the basis that I could earn them and -- and use them.

And some of my -- my confreres, including myself, were leery about the fact that we would be going to war. And we were young, but I suppose that we got that from our parents, mostly and I don\u2019t think that was an individualistic thing that -- I don\u2019t think that I was that -- that intelligent to be able to fear that at the time. Youngsters at -- in those ages are -- you can\u2019t beat them. They\u2019re -- they can\u2019t -- nothing is ever going to happen to them. It always happens to somebody else. So as a result, we didn\u2019t fear much other than the fact that we might have to be going to war."

The thing that\u2019s sur- Interview with John Bucur \" August 18, 2003 surprising is -- 1s that when I was called, we had volunteered, and I was called to go to a railroad station and -- and from there to go to Columbus, Ohio where there [indecipherable] four days, and where they were gonna decide what to do with us. The thing that really troubled us a lot was the fact that when d -- I was -- went to the station, my father and mother came with me and we went to the same station that my father went to in the first World War and I si -- was leaning against a poster and he just broke down and cried.

And we were all examined and all that and then you were sent to the places that they thought that you would do well in. I had a pretty high score, they sent me to Fort Sill, Oklahoma to school.

And we went -- well, actually we were -- in part we were one of the largest convoys that every crossed the -- th-the Atlantic Ocean, it was thousands of ships. Our ship and our equipment that was given us, was as if we were going to be going to Africa because the African theater was still in full force at that time, and we had some equipment that was all -- and we -- we -- we knew that\u2019s where we were going. We ended up in Reykjavik, Iceland. And from there we watched the skyline and then dropped down into England from there. And in England we got new equipment and new things at a new camp.

War 1s a little different than the books tell you all the time. So we trained there and then from there we moved on a number of occasions, as if we were going to go on invasion, but we didn\u2019t. And then they moved the whole unit to Bournemouth, which is a resort on the channel, a beautiful place. And about every other day we would go out as if we were going to invade and we didn\u2019t, and months went by and -- until June sixth, and June sixth the invasion occurred and we were still on the ship.

Now, an observation battalion is a flash and sound unit. And by flash meaning that there are outposts that are put out into no man\u2019s land and you can have two of those outposts, generally and they look at the enemy territory and they see the flash of a gun, and they have an [indecipherable] to take they can adjust on their instrument where that flash occurred and then they triangulate on the flash and they send it back to a central point behind, and then that\u2019s pinpointed and those coordinates then are s-sent to our artillery and our artillery fires on them. That\u2019s flash. Now, the s -- the sound unit is a little more complicated is because they -- we sunk microphones down a -- a distance of about a foot and a half or two, in a semi-circular fashion in no man\u2019s land so that the sound that traveled from the gun that fired there in the enemy territory would hit microphone number one, before it hit number two or three, and in succession you would draw a line to the microphone that was hit and then pinpoint where it came from, within about a foot and a half, actually. So we\u2019d call those coordinates and of course the artillery loved us. They said, they\u2019re -- they\u2019re our boys because they\u2019re the ones that tell us where to fire. We can\u2019t see a thing, yet -- un-un-until we have a Interview with John Bucur a August 18, 2003 coordinate that\u2019s set on. And th-those microphone, sound travels 1100 feet per second.

In fact, sometimes they moved so rapidly we didn't have a chance to set up and the -- our artillery would argue with them, hey, wait a minute, once you set up, what are we going to fire at, you know, until we get somebody out there. And we were the only unit in -- in -- in the V-corps, th-that area, so as a result it was a little difficult for them to really have a target, otherwise they\u2019d have to just time fire everything. Nevertheless, the thing about it was that our -- our -- our feeling was that they were Interview with John Bucur \u201c August 18, 2003 moving too rapidly. But we moved ver -- very, very rapidly and once we got up to the Argentan Falaise area, that -- that -- that was the -- that -- they called that the Argentan Falaise gap in which we encircled about six or seven companies of Germans completely. And un-under those -- while there, we were a -- stopped because we had -- had circled them and the continued to fight down to the last. So we- we went back into functioning again. And right about this -- this particular time we had heard that there was a -- another sound and flash observation battalion being sent from Fort Sill, th-the 285\". And that\u2019s the one that had the massacre occur at Malmedy in Belgium. And that\u2019s at the time of the big push that the Germans -- the - the -- pushing us into the ocean is what they were trying to do. The Battle of the Bulge, as they\u2019ve called it. And we had conferred with the eight -- 285\" when it came there that they can\u2019t function the way they did at Fort Sill, that this 1s war, and that -- that it\u2019s a different thing. But they were young, with young officers and young -- young companies and they just went the wrong way. Actually, what really happened was that the leader, one of their lieutenants was going down the road, and there was - the road signs were made out of wood in those days and they pointed the direction of where they -- you were going and -- and he said, now this 1s the route we\u2019re supposed to take, instead of looking at his map and being sure. Well, the Germans had turned the -- turned the sign around, and they went directly into the Germans. And they got caught by the SS troops and about a hundred and some -- 20 of them or Interview with John Bucur \u201d August 18, 2003 so, were massacred right on the spot.

That -- that was -- that\u2019s quite something. That was quite something to see. They left it intact, they did not destroy it, because they could have. Why they did, I don\u2019t know.

            "answer": "Well, we -- actually were going in -- into Germany itself at this particular point and we were approaching a -- Weimar and -- and that particular area. And the third army had come in to the fight for about several weeks or almost a month or so before, and they were pushing out farther even ahead of us. And we were moving quite rapidly, at a -- as a matter of fact. And we were just taking the towns as they came, and as we came to Weimar, that\u2019s where we came close to Buchenwald and Buchenwald was very close to the -- to this large city and we were told that when we were on bivouac there that there was a camp here, and that it -- it was a camp of -- of political as well as Jewish prisoners. And we said -- not we said, they said they would take us through the camp. And there was a select number of us that went through and I had a camera and took some of the pictures that we have here. And I -- I have to tell you this, that there was probably one of the worst things that I\u2019ve seen in my whole lifetime. And I became a surgeon after all this, and I\u2019ve seen some pretty awful things in the operating room, and everything tha -- injuries from cars and [indecipherable] but it was nothing like this. This -- this was a -- a horrible situation Interview with John Bucur *\u00b0 August 18, 2003 that should never have been allowed to occur. And as I\u2019ve mentioned earlier, I -- the people claimed that they didn\u2019t know what was going on, but you could smell the camp from miles away, because they had crematoriums and they would incinerate some of the people that they had, once they died, and some of them that hadn\u2019t even died yet, for that matter. I understand that they were functioning at full blast when the camp was captured, and that they were trying to clear their -- their rooms in the crematorium, and there were some of -- of them that were still alive, and they were just pushing them into the -- into the furnaces while they were still alive. So we knew a little bit about what was going on there. Then when we walked in to see it, to see that there was a -- a basement underneath the crematorium in which they had big hooks, like sky hooks on the wall, and they had bodies that were hung on these sky hooks and they would hang them there until they either died or what happened to them, and then put them on an elevator and send them up to the crematorium, and there dispose of them by burning them. And the stench, as I said, was -- why these people didn\u2019t know something was happening there was beyond me. But they had quotas that they a-apparently had that said that they had to have at least 80 people die per day because they had to replace them with 80 new ones that were coming in. At least that\u2019s the smallest number [indecipherable] there would be more than 80 that died during the day. How some of these people survived as long as they did, we could not understand. When we came in, there were some of them that were still Interview with John Bucur 7 August 18, 2003 walking around, but we were warned not to try to feed them or try to do anything. They were under medical con -- surveillance and so forth. But it was just atrocious and that\u2019s wa -- that\u2019s how I got these pictures that I -- that I ha -- that I took. Th-This was still there cause it was still fresh. This hadn\u2019t been -- hadn\u2019t been cleaned up or moved or anything, and that\u2019s why they wanted us to see it."

I said, well, I\u2019ve missed so much school, I'd like to apply to go to school here. I had heard about an American school in Biarritz, France, and they says, okay. And I applied and within 24 hours I was on a train on the way to Biarritz. And as I was on the way to Biarritz, we were -- we had stopped in -- in Nancy, France, Nantaise as they call it and the newspapermen were Interview with John Bucur a August 18, 2003 howling and yowling that we dropped an atom bomb on the Japanese. That was Nagasaki, or -- or Hiroshima, which one of them was first. And that this was anticipation of the end of the war. And on -- on the next station that we stopped at, they said that probably the war would end. And then I understand we dropped another bomb subsequently and then the war did end. But in the meantime I went to Biarritz, and this is on the Bay of Biscay, on the Atlantic, it\u2019s a big, beautiful resort that the Germans used for their officers. So we went into a city -- I w-went into a city that was pro-German. They didn\u2019t want us in there at all, cause they had it nice.

And while there is when Bailey did his first heart surgery, at Harmon Hospital there.

I said, I\u2019ll be glad to, because I had a lot of experience in surgery from where I had come from. And I did. And I was so taken by him while we were operating that he challenged me to the point whereby he said, I will get you a residency, if not right here, I know where y -- I want you to go. And I said, are you -- he said, you\u2019d make a great neurosurgeon. I said, well I -- I just wanted to be a surgeon at that time and he se -- I says, but that means another five or six years. And up until that particular point, you know, I [indecipherable] I wondered whether that was a wise decision to make, but I\u2019m -- I dil -- I was delighted with what we were doing, so I said yes. Anyway, then he was one of my champions as far as referral was concerned and I applied to several places that he had w-wanted me to go, and ended up under Jack French in Long Beach, California, the V.A. hospital, and spent five years there. And in that fifth year I was chief of neurosurgery at the hospital because Jack French got married, and he wa -- Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with John Bucur ~ August 18, 2003 married the diva Dorothy Kirsten.

This was back in Stalin\u2019s days. Anyway, the thing about it was that he -- and he wanted to take a year off as a sabbatical and he says, you\u2019re going to be chief. And I went from, I think it was 9,000 dollars a year to 30,000 dollars a year as chief. Wow, talk about living it up. I still remember that very well. I was married at that time and we had our first child there in -- in Long Beach. And things were pretty tough on 9,000 dollar a year and we lived just a -- where Disneyland was built. And the kids in my youngster\u2019s age group were asked to come to try out Disneyland before they even opened it. And so he got to know pretty well what the rides were going to be and everything else. But we didn\u2019t stay there, I wanted to come back east again. The California type of life was not my type of life. [indecipherable] as I always say, the -- there was always somebody running around with somebody else\u2019s wife. And it was just different. A bar on every corner, school three sessions a day. Some of them were four hours apiece and they\u2019d have the three sessions, three different groups. Th-They were crowded. So anyhow, I-I wanted to come back here, and I came. When I finished I came back here. And the reason I did come to this particular area is because before I went overseas I was stationed at Fort Mead. And when I had got leave while I was stationed at Fort Mead, I came into this area and came into Arlington, and I loved Interview with John Bucur ~ August 18, 2003 Arlington. Arlington was just gorgeous. Still is, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t was just gorgeous. I said, one of these days I\u2019m going to live there. And that\u2019s what I did, I came here. There was one other neurosurgeon here and we went into partnership together and everybody in the District of Columbia kept saying, what are you -- what are you going over there, that\u2019s on the other side of the river. Nothing is every going to happen there. So the thing that happened 1s we built all these hospitals and I was the founder of Fairfax Hospital, the founder of Northern Virginia Doctor\u2019s Hospital. The founder of National Orthopedic Hospital. So we built our own hospitals and we -- w -- and it -- 1t -- 1t was quite nice and had a nice practice, and I practice in what -- what I refer to as the golden age of medicine, where there was no Medicare or Medicaid and not everybody was entitled to everything under God\u2019s creation. They got treated free in most of my practice. Back early on, 40 percent of it was gratis, it -- it was free patients, so -- but I made my first dollar when I was about 36 years old. And everybody says, boy, it takes a long time to be a neurosurgeon. It does. And I think it\u2019s going to be even longer, they\u2019re going to make it longer."
