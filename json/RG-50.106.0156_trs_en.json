            "answer": "My full name is Alfred Munzer and that\u2019s spelled M-u-n-z-e-r. The name has undergone some changes, so when I was born it was actually Minzer, M-i-n-z- e-r, because of a slight spelling error that had been made in my father\u2019s birth certificate. Someone forgot the upstroke on the -- on the U actually, which had a little umlaut on it. And officially also, when we came to the United States the name was changed back to Munzer, M-u-e-n-z-e-r. So we have all three spellings, but commonly I use M-u-n-z-e-r."

Just a very -- I think actually the first thing that happened was the banning of shechitah, ritual slaughter and then just things got tighter and tighter. And I think they try -- my -- my perception is that they really tried to go on with their lives as -- as normally as possible in Holland, and I\u2019m not sure how directly threatened they felt in Holland, actually. My feeling is that for a long time they somehow felt safe. As far as I know, my father never made any attempt to -- to emigrate, for example, to the United States or anywhere else.

            "question": "Mm-hm. And then your mother became pregnant with you.",
            "answer": "Certainly by the time my mother became pregnant with me, conditions in Holland had really deteriorated a great deal. By then the -- the occupation was in full swing, and this was an unplanned pregnancy. And my mother was advised in Interview with Alfred Munzer \u00b0 August 4, 2002 very strong terms by her obstetrician to have an abortion. He told her that it would be immoral to -- to bring another Jewish child into the world. And my mother, this is one of the times when she did turn to the Bible, and she read the story of Hannah, who desperately wanted to have a child, and it was in reading that story, my mother told me, that she decided that she could not possibly have an abortion. As aresult of that, her obstetrician refa -- refused to have anything further to do with her, and so I was -- I was born not in a hospital, but I was born at home actually, with th -- with the help of -- of a nurse, rather than attended by an obstetrician. And I was born actually one month prematurely, November, as I said, November 23\", 1941. And this led to another dilemma at the time, actually, and that\u2019s whether to have a -- a bris or a circumcision. Again my -- my parents friends advised very strongly against it because that would identify me as being Jewish and then the pediatrician who examined me after my birth came out and told my father that I -- that I would need a circumcision, that there was a medical need for it, and my father at that point of course made the decision that we would have a regular bris. And I have some wonderful photographs of -- of that bris. They\u2019re very remarkable photographs, they\u2019re very, very tiny, they\u2019re only about one by one and a half inch in size, but my mother was to keep them hidden on her body for the year- subsequent years when she was in the concentration camps.

            "question": "So you were born, you were circumcised and then the next development?",
            "answer": "Well the next development, I -- I was born, as I said, in November, and by the following May ts -- is when it became apparent that the family would have to go into hiding. That\u2019s when Jews began -- were deported openly in Holland and the -- the first person who was actually called up by the -- by the Germans was my father, to -- to go to a so-called work camp. What he initially did was he -- he scheduled a hernia operation, which he had postponed previously, went into the hospital, had the operation and that delayed his -- his going to the concentration camps for awhile. And then the next thing that happened was that he had a mock suicide attempt, which gained him admission, like many other Jews apparently, to a psychiatric ho- hospital near The Hague, called The Remarkkliniek. And that\u2019s -- so he entered there, basically under the pretext of being a patient. My mother, in the meantime, began to look for hiding places for my sisters and for myself. The f -- my father -- my parents decided that we should not go be hidden together, but that we should -- should hide in -- in different places, so that if -- if one person were killed or found out, at least someone would survive, one person in the family would survive or the others would survive. My sisters were placed -- we have very close friends among our neighbors. The Van Luhrmann sisters, they were two sisters, Jo, J-o and Ko, K-o were their first names, Jo and Ko Van Luhrmann. They were very, very close Interview with Alfred Munzer \u00b0 August 4, 2002 to us, very religious Catholic and they were instrumental in several things. First they -- they had my sisters -- facilitated the enrollment of my sisters in a Catholic school, and that was sort of the first attempt, really, at hiding their identity. And then through their church in The Hague, a church which I have visited since then, on the street called Alonstraat, and through the intervention also of two priests, a father by the name of -- one father was Schulling, S-c-h-u-I-l-i-n-g, and I right now can\u2019t remember the name of the other one, but anyway, these two priests were instrumental in finding a Catholic family that was willing to take my sisters. The woman in that family was also very religious, very devout Catholic. She had had a vision telling her -- where the Virgin Mary told her to take in Jewish children. And th-that\u2019s what led to my sisters being placed with this woman. Subsequently, my mother asked a neighbor across the way from us, where we lived, to -- to take me in. And th-the plan, apparently was for me to place -- be placed with her, and then eventually to be transferred to a safer place somewhere in the Dutch countryside, where most Jewish children apparently were hidden."

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Munzer \u201d August 4, 2002 Her name was Annie Madna and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the woman I was -- I was placed with."

And they had had -- they had tw -- three children, and the three children really were apparently in and out of my mother\u2019s house all the time. It was a very, very close relationship. They also played with my two sisters and knew them very well. So it was -- it was a logical thing for me, you know, to be placed with her initially, certainly. That probably was in September 1941, because I -- I think I was nine months old at the time when I was placed with Annie. And at that point my mother sold most of our furniture and belongings and placed a lot of 1tems 1n hiding with our neighbors, basically emptied the house and she too, she joined my father in -- in hiding at the same psychiatric clinic, the Remarkkliniek and -- but sh -- in her case, she worked there as an attendant, as a nurse\u2019s aid, basically."

So these people had been confined for -- for much of their lives and it was a tremendous shock for her.

I\u2019m not sure whether that was actually Christmas day, it may have been in -- and I have some notes somewhere -- it may have been the feast of Santa Claus, which 1s also a big deal in Holland, which is the sixth of December, but I think this was actually f- for -- for Christmas day. Yeah, it was Christmas day. And they -- so that that part of the family at least, was reunited that -- one last time. This was December 25\", 1942. The following day the clinic was invaded by the Germans and apparently was emptied not only of all the Jews who were hiding there, but also of all the patients and the entire staff, they were all taken prisoner. And my parents were taken, first to a -- a temporary prison in The Hague, the former home of the philosopher, Dutch Interview with Alfred Munzer \" August 4, 2002 philosopher Spinoza had been converted into a prison. And then, just within a matter of days really, early in January they were transferred to the first concentration camp, and that was Westerbork.

My mother was put in charge of the nursery there, of taking care of -- of young children, and it gave her, she said, a sense of security that- that her own children were not there.

And I -- I think at that point every attempt was made probably, to keep things as secret as possible, so she did not disclose. There was some contact later on, and I can mention that now, is actually my mother, on -- on her way subsequently to -- to Auschwitz, wrote a little Interview with Alfred Munzer \" August 4, 2002 note on a piece of -- of toilet paper which said, en route to Auschwitz, all is well. And she dropped that on the railroad tracks and she put an address on it, not -- I -- probably to my mother\u2019s neighbors, not to where my sisters were or I was. And a railroad worker in Holland found the note and it did make its way back. I\u2019ve never seen the note, I\u2019m not sure whether my mother saved it or not, but there 1s a very similar note in the museum in Amsterdam. So I -- I assume that this was really s- something that was done fairly commonly. But in any event, from Westerbork, my- my parents were deported to the next concentration camp, which was Vught. And Vught is -- is a -- is a camp located in northern hol -- northwestern Holland -- northeastern Holland, sorry, not far from the city of Eindhoven, and it was home to the Philips factory.

And so she started doing that, she claimed that she knew how to -- how to work in electronics, and she was -- that led to a transfer to the Telefunken factory in Reichenbach, sort of a continuation, if you will, of what she had been doing at Philips in -- in -- in Vught. And in Reichenbach she -- she worked assembling radio tubes. Her state of mind at that point actually improved, or she took heart from the fact that there were not only Jewish and other -- other inmates of the concentration camps working at Telefunken, but there were also German soldiers who had been injured on the Russian front, many of whom were missing limbs and Interview with Alfred Munzer \" August 4, 2002 were put to work basically, as best they could in the factory. And their state of mind, they were so anti-Hitler, and anti-Himmler that they would do everything to- to sabotage the effort at that point. And she took tremendous heart from that, and told me of her own sabotage efforts basically, you know, she would spend the whole day assembling the radio tube, and then when the alarm sounded, or the siren sounds at the end of the day, she would take the -- the entire radio tube apart and put it back in the drawer and then the following day would start the process again, which 1s kind of a daring thing, certainly. But by that time, things like that were quite common."

I did not realize that until much later, but my father actually remained in Auschwitz, amazingly for -- for over a year, before being transferred to another hellhole, Mauthausen, another work camp, death camp. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s hard to distinguish the two suddenly -- certainly. And then he was transferred from Mauthausen after being there for several months, to several other, smaller subsidiaries of Mauthausen; Gusen, Steyr and then finally ended up Interview with Alfred Munzer \" August 4, 2002 in a camp called Ebensee. My mother and I for many years thought that he worked in salt mines. I don\u2019t know where we got that idea from, but there were salt mines in- in that area, that part of Austria, actually. And it\u2019s called the Salzkammergut. And -- but the-these were actually abandoned salt mines that were used for assembling of V-2 rockets.

And he -- he remained there through the liberation, survived the liberation by the Americans, and -- but was much too weak, contracted- well, what we was told was tuberculosis and died still in Ebensee and still without having been able to establish contact with us, two months after the war, on July 25\", 1945. He -- he died in a -- ac -- a convent in Ebensee that had been converted into a hospital for concentration camp victims who were very ill. My partner Joel and I visited the -- the convent, actually, and spoke to one of the sisters about her experience there, and she -- she had -- she was much too young, I think, to have been there, actually. But she said that -- that literally there were hundreds of inmates who were being cared for, and that people were just also dying on a daily basis.

Tol\u00e9 Madna was the ex-husband of Annie Madna. They had joint custody of their three children, Vidy -- Willy, Davy and Robby. And so I was transferred to -- eventually to -- to her husband. Tol\u00e9 Madna had a housekeeper by the name of Mima Saina, S-a-i-n-a. We don\u2019t even know what -- what -- what her real name was, if that was her real name.

And it was a -- a -- a very modest house in -- not too far from the -- the home of my parents and also my -- my parent\u2019s home was actually an apartment that was just a door away from where my mothe -- my father\u2019s business was, his store was. And this was probably half a mile, or a mile away from-om where the store was, certainly within walking distance, was where the van Kinsbergenstraat house was. It had a front room, sort of a middle room, typical Dutch house and then a back room and then two little rooms at the very, very end. And I slept in sort of an enclosed porch, as I remember. My father -- my foster father, Papa Madna also had kept birds, that was his hobby. He had canaries. And that was one of the other sounds, besides the -- the -- the lullabies, the Indonesian lullaby, what I also remember was the sound of canaries.

He had a tremendous love for his birds. It was a very joyful household as I -- as I remember. I -- I do remember one specific thing, which must have been when I was a little bit older, obviously. I came there when I was less than a year old, my guess is when I was about two or three. I - Interview with Alfred Munzer ut August 4, 2002 I tried to copy the writing. I saw my -- the -- my foster -- my sisters, then sisters, Willy and Davy tri -- writing and so I scribbled on a piece of paper.

I -- I also remember some of the f -- a little bit of the furniture. Here in the apartment I have -- I have some items actually that were in -- in the house. There was a big, Indonesian wayang doll, which is a puppet, which is now hanging in my foyer. And just to show, you know, the dimensions of -- of -- perceived dimensions as a child, Papa Madna had a -- a little liquor cabinet that was shaped like a barrel, and to me it looked very big, actually and it wasn\u2019t until many, many years later, recently in fact, that I encountered that barrel again and realized that it was very tiny. And I -- I -- that barrel is now in my apartment as well, I -- it -- 1t arrived here rece -- just a few weeks ago. And just -- just one other reminder of those days. I also remember some of the toys I had. I had a big yellow stuffed dog and then a little stuffed rabbit, also yellow. And I subsequently found out that that\u2019s where much of my mother\u2019s jewelry was actually hidden, was sewn into -- to th -- my toy rabbit. I also, towards the -- remember one particular time when I was hungry and the last winter of the war in Holland was extremely bad, very rough, and there was really very, very little food. And the only thing we had to eat at that time -- again something I found out Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Munzer \u201c August 4, 2002 subsequently, is tulip bulbs. And I remember waking up, or -- one night and feeling hungry and seeing the table set for the following morning. And so I just sat down at the table, waiting to be fed, and I -- I -- I really distinctly remember falling asleep and my head falling into the plate. That\u2019s one very distinct memory.

            "answer": "He was a very affectionate, very warm person. I\u2019m not sure about physical affection, but you know, we -- we were very, very, very close. He was always to -- to the very end very protective of me, certainly. And I remember sitting on his lap. I remember also, this was immediately after the war when I was allowed to go out of the house, I remember sitting on the back of his bicycle, or he also had a little seat on the front of his bicycle where I would sit, and I enjoyed that a great deal. We would take long walks together. He -- the -- we\u2019d alway -- he would always -- this was after the war, immediately after the war an-and he worked in a -- in a restaurant and I would go up the back stairs with him and the Indonesian women who worked in the kitchens would always have little snacks for me. He -- he always as -- as -- even when it was really no longer necessary he would always have a -- a little savings, a piggy bank for me, for example. He fashioned those out of his cigarette boxes. These were Player cigarettes, which came in metal cans at the time, and I Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Munzer * August 4, 2002 remember he made those into a piggy bank for myself. And that continued for a long time. He bought me comic books, because he knew there was one comic strip that I really enjoyed called \u201cPanda\u201d which was really just only found in Holland, and he would always buy me the little books, and I -- I really enjoyed those. So we - we really had a very, very close relationship. And that -- that continued to the very end of his life when he died at age 96. I-I saw him just two months before he died. Joel and I went to vi -- went to Holland and we visited him, spent quite a bit of time with him and with his t -- other children. And I -- I remember his final gesture- first of all, his final words to me was to -- to be careful, and watch over my mother, which was very typical. This is the way he had always been, very concerned about her as well. And then, as we were leaving the apartment building he stood at the window waving a white handkerchief. And that was the last gesture, that was the last time I saw him alive. And then two months later I went back for the funeral. And people say that he kept himself alive waiting for me to come and visit him one last time because he -- he and I were very, very close. And I also to -- to the very end always called him Papa. There were no qualifications to that. Now, Mima we have not talked about. Obviously, the person who really raised me, especially when I was very young, when I was an infant, was Mima. I was told that I slept in her bed, slept with her. And I was also told that Mima kept a knife under Interview with Alfred Munzer \u201c August 4, 2002 her pillow and that she said that if ever the Germans came for me, she would kill me and then herself. Again, I have no direct knowledge of that, but that\u2019s what I was told. I was very, very close to her. I have absolutely no direct memory of -- of Mima, except perhaps the few words of -- of -- of Malay Indonesian that I remember, but other than that, I have no direct memory while she was alive. Mima tragically died shortly after the war. She died in October 1945 of a cerebral hemorrhage, very, very unexpectedly. And I do remember visiting her grave many times. I also remember going back there to -- to the grave when Papa Madna buried his favorite canary in -- in the same grave, the gravesite. And many, many years later I went to visit the grave with Papa Madna. And th-there -- there was a woman at the gate, who again, because of the combination of an Indonesian man and a Caucasian young man -- younger man, immediately knew who I was and recognized me from the little child who had come to visit the grave of Mima. And I was able to find the grave without anybody telling me where it was. So there was a very sharp divide, I just totally bla -- have -- have totally -- have no direct memory of her alive, but I do remember her grave very well, very distinctly."

It\u2019s interesting because I don\u2019t have any direct memory of that, but I do have a memory of about eight months later or so, being with my mother at the place where we watched the parade and telling her that\u2019s where I was with Mima.

But other than that, I really don\u2019t have any -- any specific memories of -- of the months before my mother returned. When I was -- I -- I was sleeping the night she came back and someone came to wake me up. I don\u2019t know who it was. I think it was one of my sisters, foster sisters, Davy or Willy. And I went to the front room of the house where everybody was sitting in a circle. And I was crying because I was unhappy about being woken up, and I was being passed around from lap to lap. And I do Interview with Alfred Munzer \u201d August 4, 2002 remember very distinctly refusing to sit in a strange woman\u2019s lap, and that, of course, was my own mother. And it took awhile for my mother to -- for me to get used to my mother, and to be -- I -- I have no specific memories of all the things that happened. One thing my mother told me was that she as -- she told Mima -- she- she got tickets for Mima to go to a movie, which was something very special at that time, and just so -- so that my mother would have some time alone with me. And Mima left the house and then came back a few minutes later and told my mother, don\u2019t hit him. Just -- that\u2019s how protective, of course, Mima was, even vis- a-vis with my mother.

And my mother -- my mother\u2019s neighbor, the Van Luhrmann family, they were both schoolteachers and they had taught my sisters how to -- to read and write at a very, very young age.

And I remember had a little devil one side, a little angel on the other side. And I -- I remember very distinctly looking at those.

            "answer": "Well, before I even started schooling, my mother, who as I said before, did not really want me to learn how to read or write before had to teach me some other things. And that was the first thing she taught me, was really a love for -- for theater, and for theater type games, and I remember very distinctly playing those. She would tell me things that -- plays that she had done when she was a young girl, young -- growing up 1n Poland, she was part of a -- a theater company. And I would remember those, and that\u2019s -- and I would -- I would actually start playing those before I even learned how to read or write, with a puppet theater. That became one of my favorite toys. Another thing that really fascinated me, probably because I Interview with Alfred Munzer \" August 4, 2002 had spent those early years completely confined to the house was the tramway outside and going from place to place on -- on public -- this public conveyance, on the tramway. And I very quickly memorized all of the stops on the tramway, the local tramway. And one of the first toys that I got from Papa Madna after the war for my -- the first birthday that occurred after the war was a miniature tram. And right about that time the numbers, in sort of a bureaucratic thing, were -- were changed on the tramway. And I remember, since I didn\u2019t know how to read or write yet, but I did remember asking either Willy or Davy to make sure and change the number on my tramway. It\u2019s a very, very distinct memory I have. This was just about the time when I started kindergarten. The kindergarten was right around the corner from the house that my mother and I lived in, which was on a place called Archimaidastraat [indecipherable] street -- straat in -- in -- in The Hague and right around the corner was the first school that I went to. And I do remember very distinctly enjoying kindergarten, doing all the things pe -- children do in kindergarten, you know, making things wi -- c -- playing with clay, remember that very distinctly. Little artwork, bringing that home, learning about some -- some holidays. For example, I -- I learned about Mother\u2019s day through kindergarten and bringing home a card that I had made for my mother. I also remember going shopping to buy my mother a gift, and 1t was a geranium. That was the first plant. I Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Munzer . August 4, 2002 went to a store and asked her, you know, if she has this much money, whatever it was, I said, what would she get? And so that\u2019s -- that was the first time I ever bought a gift for my mother. I think for her birthday, which was very close actually, since that was May 20\" -- the two were very close -- I bought her a bottle of perfume which I accidentally dropped. Also one of those -- those childhood memories. I kept it hidden from her in back of -- and so I was holding it in back of me, and phew, it fell to the floor as th -- as she opened the door. After -- 1t was after kindergarten that -- just about that time that my mother bought her business. That was in a -- that was a -- a cosmetic store, perfume store. It was in the --in -- not ina very good neighborhood, quite far away from where we had lived before and where I had spent my years with the Madnas. This was near the -- one the train stations in The Hague. Little bit of a red light district, as a matter of fact, and certainly non -- not a wealthy neighborhood, but it was the only -- housing was extremely short in Holland because o f-- in The Hague especially, because such a big part of the city had been bombed out by the allies, actually. And so we -- she found this -- this store, this perfume store from a man who -- it was called Parfumerie Idajale, and she bought it from a man by the name of Sharfstein who moved to South America. And she took over the store and we lived in back of the store. And then I -- she -- she had to decided on a school for me to go to -- decided that the -- the public Interview with Alfred Munzer \" August 4, 2002 schools were just not the greatest in that neighborhood. There was a -- a Catholic school right across the street from us, but for whatever reason, my mother did not want to go that route -- route again, because probably it brought back too many memories of my sisters. So instead, I went to a -- a private Protestant school called the Weeshuis, it was called Weeshuis, it means orphanage. I don\u2019t know whether there -- there ever was an orphanage attached to that school at one point, but that was what it was called, the orphanage school. Which was a fair distance from -- from home, but not -- not too great and I -- I was able to walk to school by myself, and I went there for my -- for the first few grades, first two grades."

They -- my -- my Uncle Emil, whom I mentioned earlier, had actually been hidden with them in this little town called Rijnsburg, outside of Leiden. And -- but he was -- he was found out by the Germans and was deported. And I never really found out anything else about him. I have no new information whatsoever. But we became very close friends with the Ravensbergan family and we would spend many weekends traveling there.

And that\u2019s, I think, when she became really very -- even closer friends with -- with these -- the Ravensbergan in -- in Rijnsburg. And we would go there almost every other weekend. And -- and leaving them when we moved to Brussels was very, very difficult. And I remember catching rides Interview with Alfred Munzer * August 4, 2002 periodically to get back to visit them. Rijnsburg is a -- is an area where it\u2019s in the middle of all the flower fields of Holland, the flower industry. And trucks with flowers would go to Belgium to deliver them to the market.

I-I don\u2019t f -- you know, I -- when I was in elementary school I became -- I had -- I became very, very ill. I had a ruptured appendix. And this was in my first year in elementary school, if I remember correctly. And at that -- at that time there was no -- there were no antibiotics, as yet. Penicillin had just come out. So I was really very, very sick. I was in the hospital for about 10 weeks altogether. And my mother had a tremendous fear that she was going to lose me at that time. And she talked about that, a lot. And that\u2019s -- that\u2019s when I really found out how much I meant to her, that -- that -- you Interview with Alfred Munzer ~ August 4, 2002 know. I was the one thing that kept her going, and she told me that many, many, many times. So yes, you know, she was very protective.

I went to -- I would go to the Protestant elementary school in the mornings and then in the afternoon I would go to a cheder, to a -- a Hebrew school which was in a building adjacent to the big synagogue in The Hague.

I think at the same time, virtually that I started elementary school, I started going to the cheder, which wasn\u2019t much of a school at the time because there were very, very few kids left. My teacher was the cantor of the synagogue, Mr. Mussel, and I -- I don\u2019t remember too much of what we -- what he ler -- what he taught us, but I -- and shortly -- it was around that time also, when my mother definitely found out that my father had died, when we got documentation through the Red Cross. My mother had a very good friend who worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Liza. And he managed to speed things up so that we got documents from the Red Cross explaining exactly what had happened to my father.

I remember, you know, going out and buying matzos, which were hard to get in Holland. They were round and came in special boxes. The other thing was that -- that I remember in terms of -- of -- of Jewish things is that I had -- a-as I indicated before, I went to a Protestant school, and either the principal of the school or someone passed out -- passed my name on to a -- a pastor, a p -- a Protestant pastor who was a Jewish convert, by the name of Suril Tabachsblaat. And he came to my mother\u2019s store with the idea, I think, of trying to convert her to becoming Protestant. But by the time he left the store, she had sent him on errands in Interview with Alfred Munzer *\u00b0 August 4, 2002 Antwerp, she knew he was going to Antwerp, and so he brought back mezuzahs and a siddur, which we didn\u2019t have, you know, none of that was left. And to this day the mezuzah on my door is the mezuzah that Mr. Tabachsblaat brought back from Antwerp. She also persuaded him to let her -- and I don\u2019t think it took much - she told him, she said we were going to have a Seder and she said, you know, Seder is not necessarily a Jewish thing, why don\u2019t you have a Seder in your church? And she -- she persuaded him, something that became very commonplace afterwards, to have a Seder in the church. And my mother spoke to his congregants about the Jewish lifecycle events. And my mother, in many ways, I think, rediscovered Judaism after the war. Her experiences in the concentration camps did not seem to lessen her faith, but if anything increased it, and she became much more interested in Judaism after the war.

And my mother gave her some -- some money, some gifts. I don\u2019t know whether my mother had any subsequent contact with her. That must obviously have been an incredibly difficult time. We also had continued contact with the two priests, one of them I mentioned before, Father Schulling, the other one was called Father Lodders, L-o-d-d-e-r-s, and he was -- oh, he was much younger though, Schulling was the older man and Lodders was a- a younger, Jesuit priest.

And there were always very devout Catholics, there were the Madnas, who were probably Moslem in origin. There were the Protestant family from -- from Rijnsburg. And you have to understand that in Holland, Protestants and Catholics do not speak to each other. But there they were, all around the table for my birthday.

My mother was also an accomplished painter, but I could never master that, but the writing -- I really did enjoy playwriting. And I also learned public speaking and the way that came about was kind of interesting. When we would go spend our weekends with the family in -- in Rijnsburg, another religious angle, I would also always go to church with the family.

But the interesting thing 1s again, that my mother was not afraid to have me exposed to a variety of experiences, and then to know at the same time that my -- my Jewish foundations would remain very, very strong. One more thing in the involvement in terms of the Jewish community in -- in The Hague; I mentioned, you know, attending services, but there also was a -- a Purim party immediately -- very shortly after the war. My guess is that it would probably have been \u201946 - \u201947 approximately, Interview with Alfred Munzer \u201c August 4, 2002 probably more \u201947 because I remember where we lived at the t -- we were living at the time. My mother already had her store, and she would dress me up as a Karen Kayemet collection box. And I won second prize, actually. First prize was to a girl who was dressed up as a Sabbath queen. And that -- that was a very, very major event.

There were several Jewish students in my class in the Atheneum, and we had religious -- Jewish religious instruction in the public school. There\u2019s no separation of church and state in Belgium. And so the -- the probl -- the -- the s -- religion is handled differently.

The reason we didn\u2019t go to the United States earlier is because it took that many years to obtain a visa, because of the quota system. And so we have -- we had applied for a visa to go to Canada in about 1954 or so, but then there was a flood in Holland, and -- I may be off somewhat on my years, and all of a sudden we were told that the -- that I had -- that there was a visa for me to go to -- to th -- the United States opened the Dutch Interview with Alfred Munzer .

But that\u2019s -- as a result of that, we dropped our pla -- we had dropped our plans to go to Canada and -- so I was prepared for the change to come to the United States.

I also -- the -- my -- my si -- teachers at the yeshiva and the older, more senior students, you know, warned me, said that the United States was extremely materialistic and I shouldn\u2019t forget the things I had learned over there, you know, that -- and that one of the -- the lessons that I should take back from the war was that material objects were really not that important. There were more important things in life. School over there was very, very much geared towards the Mussar ethical movement and was very, very valuable. So I was prepared for the worst in many ways when we came to the United States, but instead, I think both of us really adapted quite well. We -- my mother purposely had booked a trip on -- that was fairly long because she -- she looked on this as kind of a- a vacation. So our -- our trip to the United States took about 10 days.

And it was a -- that was a very -- it was a difficult move because I knew- spoke very, very little English. And I must say that the school was not supportive. No one at the school asked any questions about how I had survived, how my mother survived. It -- it\u2019s unfortunately left a sour taste in my -- in my mouth.

We went to a small synagogue, Rabbi Moshe Weiss, and he had lost much of his own family and certainly we were very close with him and we talked with him. But other than that, certainly at Yeshiva University High School there was no -- there was no talk about the Holocaust at all. And I -- I was asked to take every single Regent\u2019s exam for the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Munzer \" August 4, 2002 entire four years of high school in that one year because they were afraid really of -- of giving me a diploma without doing that, so I did.

I was interviewed there and would have gone there, but ended up going to Brooklyn College. And that\u2019s where I graduated from eventually. And that was a very good experience.

For many years it was just writing and sometimes, you know, there would be -- months would go by before I would write, but we always stayed in touch. I did not go back for a visit to Holland until I think in 1973, 15 years after we had been here is when I -- when I went back on a visit and spent a lot of time -- primarily went back to visit the Madnas, basically. And Papa Madna was as protective of me as he had ever been. I had never been to -- to Amsterdam, actually. My mother had always said negative things about Amsterdam, she sa -- basically she said my father did not like Amsterdam, it was too noisy and that\u2019s why he lived -- they lived in -- in The Hague. And so, as a result of that, I had never gone to Amsterdam. And I decided that on this trip I was going to go to Amsterdam and Papa Madna again, almost completely dissuaded me from going altogether, then scared me so much that I went there for one day and then came right back t-to him. And -- but that\u2019s -- that still 1s the -- the -- the influence. You -- you asked earlier Interview with Alfred Munzer \"\u00b0 August 4, 2002 about whether my mother was -- was protective. I have the sense -- I had the sense really that 1-in many ways he was more protective of me than she was. That was very, very special. And he -- he had remarried in 1947, and I was very, very close with this second wife. And they had three children, Vonny, Tol\u00e9 and Matipah. And I was very, very close with all three of them, and remain close with them to this day. Vonny Madna and his wife Annika have been here to visit, and just a few weeks ago, their son Rodewick and his girlfriend came over here for a visit. And so the -- we\u2019re -- we\u2019re passing on the -- the accomplishments or -- of his -- of his grandfather, or -- of Tol\u00e9 Madna now to the next generation. And I think that\u2019s what the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is all about in a way. We had a -- a wondert -- we had -- we visited the museum together and the importance of a museum and of a memorial suddenly hit me. Prior to that I thought that people could get information from books, but there is something very special about a memorial, in terms of the passage from one generation to the next."

I was able to speak and converse with people without, you know, difficulty. We had Interview with Alfred Munzer = August 4, 2002 one very special experience there. We were staying again in the town, the same town where I stayed with my mother, Bad Ischl, and we had ma -- made reservations 1n a -- in an inn, and the woman who was the innkeeper, when we arrived told us that she had made a mistake. She said, you know, you\u2019re going to have to change rooms tomorrow morning because of some mistake I\u2019ve made in the reservations. And I told her that would be very difficult because we were going to take a train first thing in the morning to visit my father\u2019s grave in Ebensee. And the woman told me that her family -- she burst out in tears and she says, you know, my family is from Ebensee and I am so ashamed. And we hugged, and that -- that was truly an incredible experience. But Joel would not -- would barely look out the train window. He -- he could not bring himself to say anything positive about Austria, and couldn\u2019t wait to get away. That\u2019s one reason we did not -- this was around my - the time of my father\u2019s Yahrzeit and so we visited Ebensee and then from there, instead of going to Vienna, we went to Prague and said Kaddish in the Altneu shul."

            "answer": "Sh-She felt that I was more suited -- that I was really suited to becoming a rabbi. She -- she felt that I would not do well in -- in hav -- in business, for example. She just -- she thought that I was too, quote, honest, and that -- you know, that that -- so she wanted me to be -- to be -- she also thought that that would be a natural way to acquire a family, in a sense. But she was basically, as to a large extent on -- on the respect that rabbis have in -- in Europe, especially. When we came to the United States she realized that -- that rabbis do not necessarily have it all that easy here, and that congregations can be very difficult. So anyway, but -- but -- I had really never considered that that much. It was a -- was a brief consideration. The oth -- the other place where that came from, being a rabbi was, strangely enough, the family that we used to visit in -- in Rijnsburg, in Holland and who would take me to church and then I would repeat the sermons and one of the women there would say oh, he\u2019s going to become a preacher and then the other one would say, no, he\u2019s going to become a rabbi. And so that was -- that was one of the early things. But it Interview with Alfred Munzer \u00b0\u00b0 August 4, 2002 was -- those were the two professions that I really considered seriously. But from -- from my standpoint it was really all -- I -- I can\u2019t remember. Maybe it was when I was really sick as a child and had the ruptured appendix. That\u2019s, I think, when I really made up my mind that I was going to become a physician. But my experiences of -- of -- certainly of having had my life given to me in a -- in a very direct sense by -- by the Madna family, I would say probably it has had a major impact, not just on becoming a physician but also volunteering my time. When I picked a specialty it was one where I -- I knew I could have a wider -- I wanted one where I could have a wider impact. And so I chose lung disease because lung disease is so much related to -- to an -- the environment, it\u2019s related to smoking and I became very active in the American Lung Association and eventually served as -- as president of the American Lung Association, nationally, and also received their Will Ross medal a few years ago, which 1s their highest volunteer honor. So at -- it\u2019s -- that certainly -- and it, interestingly enough, at that ceremony the story, the Madna story was told very, very prominently and to -- to an audience of thousands of people. And the Madnas received a standing ovation. They weren\u2019t there, but you know, just -- it was -- 1t was extremely moving. So my past, my experiences certainly have been a very important part of forming my life and of determining the kind of person I am. And I guess it\u2019s possible for that, depending on the Interview with Alfred Munzer \"\u00b0 August 4, 2002 experiences, to be positive or negative and I\u2019m very fortunate that in my case, it was very positive."

You know, recently at -- when I was at Adas Israel at a service, it was a -- a young girl who had a Bat Mitzvah who came here from Russia, and th-the rabbi mentioned all the languages she spoke and all the things she had done and then he had asked her, you know, how did this happen, how -- how is this possible? And she said, it\u2019s normal. And those words really stuck because that\u2019s -- that\u2019s probably what describes the way I look on -- on what the Madnas did.

In 1973 when I went back to Holland to visit the Madnas [ also -- I was still in the air force at the time and I took a flight into -- in and out of Frankfurt, and that was the first time that I had 100 Interview with Alfred Munzer August 4, 2002 really, except for going to bat -- being in Bad Nauheim with my mother, that I spent time in -- in -- in Germany. And I had spent also a little time at that time, in Paris, and did not have very pleasant experiences as a tourist in Paris. In Germany, for the one night that I was there actually, it was in a very nice hotel, they were very honest, it was very civilized. You know, turned on the radio and it was opera and there was -- there was beautiful music. And I became -- I\u2019ve become- became more and more baffled. And to this day I -- I cannot understand how Nazism arose. I can -- I can do it on an intellectual level -- yeah, I can certainly read about it and I -- I know what happened, but it\u2019s beyond me as to why Nazism took root to the extent it did in Germany. And what frightens me about it is -- what I think is if it happened there, it can happen anywhere. I really -- because I don\u2019t think -- I cannot tell if there is anything different about the German character from any other country."

            "answer": "It was, because you know, I -- I -- I -- you know, it\u2019s -- I was more afraid before it happened, before she died. My mother, the last few years had fairly severe, progressive dementia. So I felt, you know, I was becoming -- but nonetheless, you know, that -- that\u2019s -- the touch, the warmth of being with her was very, very important. And you know, s -- even the number was very, very impor -- she didn\u2019t like to look at it, but for me, you know, it brought back a lot of memories. And -- and -- and I -- it was totally amazing to me how my -- what my mother\u2019s attitude was towards life after the war. I -- I -- to this day cannot understand that. My mother could speak with joy about her childhood in Poland, in Rymanow. Talking about, you know, the policemen called bambula and -- and all of the places where, you know, they -- the kids would go out to play and then -- and I have a very, very vivid picture, actually, of the town. She could talk to me about, you know, experiences in the concentration camps when she put on plays with other prisoners and sh -- and portraying Hitler. And then after the war, beginning -- starting a life over again, I would hear her cry at night at times, certainly, in the first few years. She would be very -- sometimes she would accidentally refer to me by my father\u2019s name and that was a very frightening thing. But somehow, you know, she was 102 Interview with Alfred Munzer August 4, 2002 always very cheerful. You know, when I was little and she had her store, after she closed the store we would take very, very long walks to the park and she would race me to the park. She took me to the theater. You know, every Su-Sunday there was always something. We either went to a museum, we went to -- to a play, we went to- J-] -- I remember the very first time I went to a -- a -- a Jewish dance company. I was probably seven years old or so, and I -- I still remember it to this day because I remember putting on a performance in the store window afterwards. It\u2019s really -- her -- her introduction of me to the theater. And then she picked up painting again.

I don\u2019t know where -- where that strength came from. And I was a very f -- I feel very glad to have had my mother for so many years."
