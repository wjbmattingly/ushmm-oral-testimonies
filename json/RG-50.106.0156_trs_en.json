            "answer": "My full name is Alfred Munzer and that\u2019s spelled M-u-n-z-e-r. The name has undergone some changes, so when I was born it was actually Minzer, M-i-n-z- e-r, because of a slight spelling error that had been made in my father\u2019s birth certificate. Someone forgot the upstroke on the -- on the U actually, which had a little umlaut on it. And officially also, when we came to the United States the name was changed back to Munzer, M-u-e-n-z-e-r. So we have all three spellings, but commonly I use M-u-n-z-e-r."

Just a very -- I think actually the first thing that happened was the banning of shechitah, ritual slaughter and then just things got tighter and tighter. And I think they try -- my -- my perception is that they really tried to go on with their lives as -- as normally as possible in Holland, and I\u2019m not sure how directly threatened they felt in Holland, actually. My feeling is that for a long time they somehow felt safe. As far as I know, my father never made any attempt to -- to emigrate, for example, to the United States or anywhere else.

He told her that it would be immoral to -- to bring another Jewish child into the world. And my mother, this is one of the times when she did turn to the Bible, and she read the story of Hannah, who desperately wanted to have a child, and it was in reading that story, my mother told me, that she decided that she could not possibly have an abortion. As aresult of that, her obstetrician refa -- refused to have anything further to do with her, and so I was -- I was born not in a hospital, but I was born at home actually, with th -- with the help of -- of a nurse, rather than attended by an obstetrician. And I was born actually one month prematurely, November, as I said, November 23\", 1941. And this led to another dilemma at the time, actually, and that\u2019s whether to have a -- a bris or a circumcision. Again my -- my parents friends advised very strongly against it because that would identify me as being Jewish and then the pediatrician who examined me after my birth came out and told my father that I -- that I would need a circumcision, that there was a medical need for it, and my father at that point of course made the decision that we would have a regular bris. And I have some wonderful photographs of -- of that bris. They\u2019re very remarkable photographs, they\u2019re very, very tiny, they\u2019re only about one by one and a half inch in size, but my mother was to keep them hidden on her body for the year- subsequent years when she was in the concentration camps.

            "answer": "Well the next development, I -- I was born, as I said, in November, and by the following May ts -- is when it became apparent that the family would have to go into hiding. That\u2019s when Jews began -- were deported openly in Holland and the -- the first person who was actually called up by the -- by the Germans was my father, to -- to go to a so-called work camp. What he initially did was he -- he scheduled a hernia operation, which he had postponed previously, went into the hospital, had the operation and that delayed his -- his going to the concentration camps for awhile. And then the next thing that happened was that he had a mock suicide attempt, which gained him admission, like many other Jews apparently, to a psychiatric ho- hospital near The Hague, called The Remarkkliniek. And that\u2019s -- so he entered there, basically under the pretext of being a patient. My mother, in the meantime, began to look for hiding places for my sisters and for myself. The f -- my father -- my parents decided that we should not go be hidden together, but that we should -- should hide in -- in different places, so that if -- if one person were killed or found out, at least someone would survive, one person in the family would survive or the others would survive. My sisters were placed -- we have very close friends among our neighbors. The Van Luhrmann sisters, they were two sisters, Jo, J-o and Ko, K-o were their first names, Jo and Ko Van Luhrmann. They were very, very close This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

First they -- they had my sisters -- facilitated the enrollment of my sisters in a Catholic school, and that was sort of the first attempt, really, at hiding their identity. And then through their church in The Hague, a church which I have visited since then, on the street called Alonstraat, and through the intervention also of two priests, a father by the name of -- one father was Schulling, S-c-h-u-I-l-i-n-g, and I right now can\u2019t remember the name of the other one, but anyway, these two priests were instrumental in finding a Catholic family that was willing to take my sisters. The woman in that family was also very religious, very devout Catholic. She had had a vision telling her -- where the Virgin Mary told her to take in Jewish children. And th-that\u2019s what led to my sisters being placed with this woman. Subsequently, my mother asked a neighbor across the way from us, where we lived, to -- to take me in. And th-the plan, apparently was for me to place -- be placed with her, and then eventually to be transferred to a safer place somewhere in the Dutch countryside, where most Jewish children apparently were hidden."

They also played with my two sisters and knew them very well. So it was -- it was a logical thing for me, you know, to be placed with her initially, certainly. That probably was in September 1941, because I -- I think I was nine months old at the time when I was placed with Annie. And at that point my mother sold most of our furniture and belongings and placed a lot of 1tems 1n hiding with our neighbors, basically emptied the house and she too, she joined my father in -- in hiding at the same psychiatric clinic, the Remarkkliniek and -- but sh -- in her case, she worked there as an attendant, as a nurse\u2019s aid, basically."

Yeah, it was Christmas day. And they -- so that that part of the family at least, was reunited that -- one last time. This was December 25\", 1942.

And whenever -- and I\u2019ve maintained contact over the years and there is no question but that when I\u2019m with them, I always feel the younger sibling. Mr. Madna subsequently remarried and three more children and there is no question but that I feel like the older sibling to the next three children. So I\u2019m really the bridge between them. In fact, the only time that they ever talk to each other is when I\u2019m there."

He was very proud of the fact that he owned a motorcycle, and he -- he really became a part of -- of the very -- the young Indonesian community that was being established in Holland. Indonesia, of course, was a Dutch colony at the time. And he -- he then married Annie Madna, further really integrating him really into - into Dutch society. But he also, I think felt very proud of his -- of his Indonesian heritage. He -- there were paintings in the house that illustrated, really, life in the Indonesian villages. And he -- he enjoyed gardening in -- in the home, in van Kinsbergenstraat actually, we kept chickens in the backyard, which he -- he really greatly enjoyed. Many years later, when he moved to a smaller apartment after the war, he -- he got one of those little gardens outside the city and th-there was no question as t -- his garden, his little garden was the most luxuriant of any of them around. And -- and he had all sorts of -- of little quirks. For example, he -- he dug a big hole in that backyard, which became a -- a refrigerator.

He was always to -- to the very end very protective of me, certainly. And I remember sitting on his lap. I remember also, this was immediately after the war when I was allowed to go out of the house, I remember sitting on the back of his bicycle, or he also had a little seat on the front of his bicycle where I would sit, and I enjoyed that a great deal. We would take long walks together. He -- the -- we\u2019d alway -- he would always -- this was after the war, immediately after the war an-and he worked in a -- in a restaurant and I would go up the back stairs with him and the Indonesian women who worked in the kitchens would always have little snacks for me.

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Munzer * August 4, 2002 remember he made those into a piggy bank for myself. And that continued for a long time. He bought me comic books, because he knew there was one comic strip that I really enjoyed called \u201cPanda\u201d which was really just only found in Holland, and he would always buy me the little books, and I -- I really enjoyed those. So we - we really had a very, very close relationship. And that -- that continued to the very end of his life when he died at age 96. I-I saw him just two months before he died. Joel and I went to vi -- went to Holland and we visited him, spent quite a bit of time with him and with his t -- other children. And I -- I remember his final gesture- first of all, his final words to me was to -- to be careful, and watch over my mother, which was very typical. This is the way he had always been, very concerned about her as well. And then, as we were leaving the apartment building he stood at the window waving a white handkerchief. And that was the last gesture, that was the last time I saw him alive. And then two months later I went back for the funeral. And people say that he kept himself alive waiting for me to come and visit him one last time because he -- he and I were very, very close. And I also to -- to the very end always called him Papa. There were no qualifications to that. Now, Mima we have not talked about. Obviously, the person who really raised me, especially when I was very young, when I was an infant, was Mima. I was told that I slept in her bed, slept with her. And I was also told that Mima kept a knife under This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Again, I have no direct knowledge of that, but that\u2019s what I was told. I was very, very close to her. I have absolutely no direct memory of -- of Mima, except perhaps the few words of -- of -- of Malay Indonesian that I remember, but other than that, I have no direct memory while she was alive. Mima tragically died shortly after the war. She died in October 1945 of a cerebral hemorrhage, very, very unexpectedly. And I do remember visiting her grave many times. I also remember going back there to -- to the grave when Papa Madna buried his favorite canary in -- in the same grave, the gravesite. And many, many years later I went to visit the grave with Papa Madna. And th-there -- there was a woman at the gate, who again, because of the combination of an Indonesian man and a Caucasian young man -- younger man, immediately knew who I was and recognized me from the little child who had come to visit the grave of Mima. And I was able to find the grave without anybody telling me where it was. So there was a very sharp divide, I just totally bla -- have -- have totally -- have no direct memory of her alive, but I do remember her grave very well, very distinctly."

And that was the first thing she taught me, was really a love for -- for theater, and for theater type games, and I remember very distinctly playing those.

And I very quickly memorized all of the stops on the tramway, the local tramway. And one of the first toys that I got from Papa Madna after the war for my -- the first birthday that occurred after the war was a miniature tram. And right about that time the numbers, in sort of a bureaucratic thing, were -- were changed on the tramway. And I remember, since I didn\u2019t know how to read or write yet, but I did remember asking either Willy or Davy to make sure and change the number on my tramway. It\u2019s a very, very distinct memory I have. This was just about the time when I started kindergarten. The kindergarten was right around the corner from the house that my mother and I lived in, which was on a place called Archimaidastraat [indecipherable] street -- straat in -- in -- in The Hague and right around the corner was the first school that I went to. And I do remember very distinctly enjoying kindergarten, doing all the things pe -- children do in kindergarten, you know, making things wi -- c -- playing with clay, remember that very distinctly.

I think for her birthday, which was very close actually, since that was May 20\" -- the two were very close -- I bought her a bottle of perfume which I accidentally dropped. Also one of those -- those childhood memories. I kept it hidden from her in back of -- and so I was holding it in back of me, and phew, it fell to the floor as th -- as she opened the door. After -- 1t was after kindergarten that -- just about that time that my mother bought her business. That was in a -- that was a -- a cosmetic store, perfume store. It was in the --in -- not ina very good neighborhood, quite far away from where we had lived before and where I had spent my years with the Madnas. This was near the -- one the train stations in The Hague.

And so we -- she found this -- this store, this perfume store from a man who -- it was called Parfumerie Idajale, and she bought it from a man by the name of Sharfstein who moved to South America.

            "answer": "Well, this was something that really was encouraged by my mother, who had a tremendous love for theater. My mother was also an accomplished painter, but I could never master that, but the writing -- I really did enjoy playwriting. And I also learned public speaking and the way that came about was kind of interesting. When we would go spend our weekends with the family in -- in Rijnsburg, another religious angle, I would also always go to church with the family. And after the church service I would be able to repeat the sermon that I had heard almost verbatim. And so that\u2019s -- that\u2019s really where I learned public speaking, and I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve always enjoyed that, and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a very, very valuable experience I had. But the interesting thing 1s again, that my mother was not afraid to have me exposed to a variety of experiences, and then to know at the same time that my -- my Jewish foundations would remain very, very strong. One more thing in the involvement in terms of the Jewish community in -- in The Hague; I mentioned, you know, attending services, but there also was a -- a Purim party immediately -- very shortly after the war. My guess is that it would probably have been \u201946 - \u201947 approximately, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

My mother already had her store, and she would dress me up as a Karen Kayemet collection box. And I won second prize, actually. First prize was to a girl who was dressed up as a Sabbath queen. And that -- that was a very, very major event. Actually, you know, now -- now that I think about it, prior to this Purim fe -- feast, 1t was also an even earlier experience that I had, which was a Hanukkah party earlier, because I remember very distinctly the kinds of gifts that we got. And they were not toys, they were not books, they were socks and very common things that people needed immediately after the war. So that -- that probably was -- may have been the end of \u201945 - \u201946, something like that. As I remember also, related to that, going with my mother to -- to a place where packages would arrive from overseas, and one of my mother\u2019s brothers had survived and escaped to Bolivia and he arranged for packages to be sent from the United States to us.

No one at the school asked any questions about how I had survived, how my mother survived. It -- it\u2019s unfortunately left a sour taste in my -- in my mouth. The students were very, very friendly and the students were very interested in my past.

So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- but the adults were just -- I -- I -- for whatever reason, no one wants to talk about. The only person who really asked us about our survival, how we had survived, it was very interesting, it was someone who wasn\u2019t Jewish. It was when my mother went to open up a bank account at Manufacturer\u2019s Trust. And when the -- the woman who read the application, she called over the bank manager and they were both in tears practically, when they found out my father had died and how he had died and -- and such. That was -- but that was unique. Most people -- there were some other people, obviously, who had been through similar experiences we talked to. We went to a small synagogue, Rabbi Moshe Weiss, and he had lost much of his own family and certainly we were very close with him and we talked with him.

I was interviewed there and would have gone there, but ended up going to Brooklyn College. And that\u2019s where I graduated from eventually. And that was a very good experience.

My mother had always said negative things about Amsterdam, she sa -- basically she said my father did not like Amsterdam, it was too noisy and that\u2019s why he lived -- they lived in -- in The Hague. And so, as a result of that, I had never gone to Amsterdam.

We had a -- a wondert -- we had -- we visited the museum together and the importance of a museum and of a memorial suddenly hit me.

I had a ni -- a fascinating experience very recently. I - I was speaking to a young man at Congregation Bet Mishpachah and he -- his name is -- his last name is Flatow, Warren Flatow. I told him, I said, you know, Flatow is not a very common name, and I worked with a gentleman many, many years ago who was a -- was from Germany, a German refugee and whose last name was Flatow, Anzd Flatow, and he said -- and he worked as a translator and I worked in the same translation bureau in -- in New York while I was in college. And he -- he said, gee, you know, he has a grandfather the same name, but his grandfather was a lawyer and to his knowledge never worked in the translation bureau. Then he asked his father and it turned out to be the same Anzd Flatow. And we worked together at the Lawyers and Merchants Translation Bureau in New York. And he was, you know, had escaped from Germany in 1944 and was a lawyer. Obviously couldn\u2019t do any work as a lawyer in the United States, so he took this job as a translator.

She just -- she thought that I was too, quote, honest, and that -- you know, that that -- so she wanted me to be -- to be -- she also thought that that would be a natural way to acquire a family, in a sense. But she was basically, as to a large extent on -- on the respect that rabbis have in -- in Europe, especially. When we came to the United States she realized that -- that rabbis do not necessarily have it all that easy here, and that congregations can be very difficult. So anyway, but -- but -- I had really never considered that that much. It was a -- was a brief consideration. The oth -- the other place where that came from, being a rabbi was, strangely enough, the family that we used to visit in -- in Rijnsburg, in Holland and who would take me to church and then I would repeat the sermons and one of the women there would say oh, he\u2019s going to become a preacher and then the other one would say, no, he\u2019s going to become a rabbi. And so that was -- that was one of the early things. But it This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But from -- from my standpoint it was really all -- I -- I can\u2019t remember. Maybe it was when I was really sick as a child and had the ruptured appendix. That\u2019s, I think, when I really made up my mind that I was going to become a physician. But my experiences of -- of -- certainly of having had my life given to me in a -- in a very direct sense by -- by the Madna family, I would say probably it has had a major impact, not just on becoming a physician but also volunteering my time. When I picked a specialty it was one where I -- I knew I could have a wider -- I wanted one where I could have a wider impact. And so I chose lung disease because lung disease is so much related to -- to an -- the environment, it\u2019s related to smoking and I became very active in the American Lung Association and eventually served as -- as president of the American Lung Association, nationally, and also received their Will Ross medal a few years ago, which 1s their highest volunteer honor. So at -- it\u2019s -- that certainly -- and it, interestingly enough, at that ceremony the story, the Madna story was told very, very prominently and to -- to an audience of thousands of people. And the Madnas received a standing ovation. They weren\u2019t there, but you know, just -- it was -- 1t was extremely moving. So my past, my experiences certainly have been a very important part of forming my life and of determining the kind of person I am.

You know, recently at -- when I was at Adas Israel at a service, it was a -- a young girl who had a Bat Mitzvah who came here from Russia, and th-the rabbi mentioned all the languages she spoke and all the things she had done and then he had asked her, you know, how did this happen, how -- how is this possible? And she said, it\u2019s normal. And those words really stuck because that\u2019s -- that\u2019s probably what describes the way I look on -- on what the Madnas did. To me there was nothing unusual about it. That may be terrible, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s really -- 1t\u2019s really true because I -- I was so much a part of their family. They never made a big deal about it. My mother did, she expressed, certainly, her gratitude, especially to Mima. To her Mima was really the important person.
