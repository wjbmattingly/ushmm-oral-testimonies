Not with the SS trooper \u2014 troops who goose-stepped past our house one dark forbidding night, their black, shiny boots reverberating on cobblestones, singing, no, shouting in 0 \u2014 in cadence, when the Jewish blood spurts from the knife, then we will all be free. The tune has etched itself so deeply in the cells and inner rec-recesses of my brain, that I find myself humming the gruesome words, and the musical cadence that emerged together, until I am startled by the memory of that night, and by \u2014 and by my masochistic instinct to remember the event, an epic, that turned me into a scared kid. We fled the bubbling cauldron that was to become the Holocaust, and crossed the Atlantic, to the land of cowboys, Indians, and streets paved with gold. To jobless America, in Depression, but breathing the air of freedom. As the family eked out a living, each one of us working for the Yankee dollar, in order to survive and thrive, strangers 1n a strange land. I was hurt by our frantic, frenetic exodus, and angry too. I hated everything German, even though I was German, too. Reminding myself that my family, and the town\u2019s Jewish community, too, had our roots in Wertheim since 1405 A.D., as the gravestones testified, before the Nazi bullies toppled and smashed them, as a final Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild \u201d April 23, 2017 insult to the dead. Wasn\u2019t it enough that they had toppled and smashed the lives of the living? I joined the navy to fight the Germans, and was sent to the Pacific, in true snafu fashion, to fight the Japanese instead. In the postwar era, I shunned everything German. I refused to socialize and fraternize with Germans. I refused to buy anything German. I refused to make love to Germans. I refused to ride in a German car, especially the Volkswagen that Hitler had extolled. Until one day, I confronted myself with this enigma. Hitler stereotyped all Jews, as universally evil, to be excised, gassed, eradicated, destroyed. Now, I was stereotyping all Germans, shunning and reviling them, finding them all universally guilty, declaring them all universally responsible for the death of seven million Jewish brethrens. I woke up to the realization that postwar Germans who were born after Hitler, were as guilty of the Holocaust cruelties, as I was guilty of the native American holocaust that occurred 100 years ago, right here in California, a bounty on their scalps. Right here, in the good old USA, the land of Washington and Lincoln, the land of Wounded Knee, and My Lai massacres, and many more. So I made a conscious decision to stop my own brand of blind hate and intolerance. The same kind that I experienced from the Nazi bullies in their time, who shouted obscenities and insults at me, without ever bothering to know me.

And you know, there are a lot of unanswered questions, and \u2014 and I \u2014 I \u2014I s\u2014 don\u2019t know what a lot of the people were doing. They were all caught up in \u2014 in their lives. My br \u2014 the one classmate who\u2019s left was \u2014 was in \u2014 conscripted in the army, was sent to Russia, was \u2014 became a prisoner of war for two years, or three years, he was in a Russian \u2014 the worst possible condition Ru-Russian prison camp, and he survived, and ultimately he came back. I don\u2019t know whether he joined the Nazi party or not, the chances are, he did. Everybody did. Ye-Ye-Ye \u2014 I remember that even as a child, if you \u2014 if you wanted to \u2014 th-the \u2014 the bully boys, the Brownshirts, would boycott stores, Jewish stores. We had a MH \u2014 a department store in the town, Max(ph) Held, h-e-I-d was the name, Max(ph) Held was the owner, Held was the department store. And they would have the Brownshirts in front of the Jewish businesses, to censor, or \u2014 anybody who \u2014 any non-Jew who \u2014 Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild * April 23, 2017 who went into the store. And they would economically get back to \u2014 at them. And of course, Hitler passed all kinds of laws; one in particular had affected my father, that if you owed any debts to a Jew, you didn\u2019t have to pay back. So my father, his business depended on the \u2014 the crop next summer, you know. If a farmer bought a cow from him, he would pay the debt back maybe a \u2014 when the \u2014 when the crops came in. So \u2014 so a lot of those farmers stopped doing any business with my father, because they decided that the law allowed them not to pay my father back. And \u2014 and I remember, I have this one very vivid memory of waking up like one, two in the morning. We had like a bell, an old fashioned bell which you pull, in front of our house. And the bell pulled, and I went to the window, I woke up, and I saw a farmer standing there, with a cow.
