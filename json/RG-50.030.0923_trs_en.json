I returned to Wertheim with apprehension and hope, to rediscover the memories I had left behind. To rediscover the aborted part of my childhood life. To rediscover myself. Now I reconnected with my classmates, who I had seen last, when they shunned me, as they were dutily \u0152 dutifully indoctrinated to do in their eugenics classes, from which I and other Jewish students were excluded, where they were shown drawings of evil looking, long-bearded Jewish men, sucking through straw \u0152 straws, a baby\u2122s blood, with glee. Now I reconnected with my child within, with the pain I\u2122d felt then, as one or another turned away in mid-play, remembering that I was a Jew, an un-Aryan, too. Now they celebrated my return, at a special class reunion, the 10 year olds transformed into buxom women and beer bellied men. They listened in disbelief, astonishment, and sadness, to \u0152 to my last experience in Wertheim , at their hands. Quite different from what they remembered, or their consciences allowed them to remember. The gray haired women sobbed, tears streaming down, understanding their part in the tragedy, realizing that they too had been robbed of their childhood innocence, feeling \u0152 feeling so long repressed, and hidden from you \u0152 from view, by them, me, us. I\u2122ve returned to Wert heim a half dozen times, have Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild April 23, 2017 20 been welcomed by friends old and new, have received and given outpourings of hospitality. But occasionally uneasiness and paranoia seizes me, especially when I see old strangers, my age, still envisaged them in a Nazi Brownshirt, or a black SS uniform. I resist blurting out, did you leave your uniform at home? Still imagine them once marching and singing [speaks German] . When the Jewish blood spurts from the knife, then we will all be free. Deep physical wounds leave permanent scars. Mental wounds are no different. Their scars are hidden, but there, capable of flaring again. My return to Wertheim enabled me to revisit these wounds and scars, to look at them closely, to pay attention to them. But also, to see them in perspective. I can better deal with them now that I\u2122m more at peace, accepting that for better or worse, a part of me is German. The German of a Hitler, Goebbels , Bormann , but also the German of a Beethoven , Goethe, Einstown (ph) \u0152 Einstein , and Heine.\ufb02"

            "question": "Okay. So please, the \u0152 the Wertheim poem.",
            "answer": "Okay, it\u2122s called \ufb01 Return to Wertheim .\ufb02 \ufb01I\u2122ve made my peace with the past, my peace with the Germans. Not with the SS trooper \u0152 troops who goose-stepped past our house one dark forbidding night, their black, shiny boots reverberating on cobblestones, singing, no, shouting in o \u0152 in cadence, when the Jewish blood spurts from the knife, then we will all be free. The tune has etched itself so deeply in the cells and inner rec-recesses of my brain, that I find myself humming the gruesome words, and the musical cadence that emerged together, until I am startled by the memory of that night, and by \u0152 and by my masochistic instinct to remember the event, an epic, that turned me into a scared kid. We fled the bubbling cauldron that was to become the Holocaust, and crossed the Atlantic , to the land of cowboys, Indians, and streets paved with gold. To jobless America , in Depression, but breathing the air of freedom. As the family eked out a living, each one of us working for the Yankee dollar, in order to survive and thrive, strangers in a strange land. I was hurt by our frantic, frenetic exodus, and angry too. I hated everything German, even though I was German, too. Reminding myself that my family, and the town\u2122s Jewish community, too, had our roots in Wertheim since 1405 A.D., as the gravestones testified, before the Nazi bullies toppled and smashed them, as a final Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild April 23, 2017 49 insult to the dead. Wasn\u2122t it enough that they had toppled and smashed the lives of the living? I joined the navy to fight the Germans, and was sent to the Pacific, in true snafu fashion, to fight the Japanese instead. In the postwar era, I shunned everything German. I refused to socialize and fraternize with Germans. I refused to buy anything German. I refused to make love to Germans. I refused to ride in a German car, especially the Volkswagen that Hitler had extolled. Until one day, I confronted myself with this enigma. Hitler stereotyped all Jews, as universally evil, to be excised, gassed, eradicated, destroyed. Now, I was stereotyping all Germans, shunning and reviling them, finding them all universally guilty, declaring them all universally responsible for the death of seven million Jewish brethrens. I woke up to the realization that postwar Germans who were born after Hitler, were as guilty of the Holocaust cruelties, as I was guilty of the native American holocaust that occurred 100 years ago, right here in California , a bounty on their scalps. Right here, in the good old USA , the land of Washington and Lincoln , the land of Wounded Knee , and My Lai massacres, and many more. So I made a conscious decision to stop my own brand of blind hate and intolerance. The same kind that I experienced from the Nazi bullies in their time, who shouted obscenities and insults at me, without ever bothering to know me. A heavy weight lifted from my shoulders, the good vibes that I now felt, must have echoed, reverberated, Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild April 23, 2017 50 ricocheted around the world, and must have found the psychic antennas on the roof of Wertheim city hall, must have been received and heard by Josef Scheuermann , Wertheim \u2122s democratic mayor, who was scouring the world, searching for the town\u2122s 100 living Jewish survivors, out of \u0152 \ufb02 [break] \u0152 group therapy, they \u0152 and yo u know, I didn\u2122t learn very much about how the \u0152 what happened in their lives. Tha-That maybe \u0152 maybe if I should go back again, that would be something I sh \u0152 really should explore, except not \u0152 there\u2122s only one classmate left, and he is sort of my friend and host. And you know, there are a lot of unanswered questions, and \u0152 and I \u0152 I \u0152 I s \u0152 don\u2122t know what a lot of the people were doing. They were all caught up in \u0152 in their lives. My br \u0152 the one classmate who\u2122s left was \u0152 was in \u0152 conscripted in the army, was sent to Russia , was \u0152 became a prisoner of war for two years, or three years, he was in a Russian \u0152 the worst possible condition Ru-Russian prison camp, and he survived, and ultimately he came back. I don\u2122t know whether he joined the Nazi party or not, the chances are, he did. Everybody did. Ye-Ye-Ye \u0152 I remember that even as a child, if you \u0152 if you wanted to \u0152 th-the \u0152 the bully boys, the Brownshirts, would boycott stores, Jewish stores. We had a MH \u0152 a department store in the town, Max(ph) Held, h-e-l-d was the name, Max (ph) Held was the owner, Held was the department store. And they would have the Brownshirts in front of the Jewish businesses, to censor, or \u0152 anybody who \u0152 any non -Jew who \u0152 Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild April 23, 2017 51 who went into the store. And they would economically get back to \u0152 at them. And of course, Hitler passed all kinds of laws; one in particular had affected my father, that if you owed any debts to a Jew, you didn\u2122t have to pay back. So my father, his business depended on the \u0152 the crop next summer, you know. If a farmer bought a cow from him, he would pay the debt back maybe a \u0152 when the \u0152 when the crops came in. So \u0152 so a lot of those farmers stopped doing any business with my father, because they decided that the law allowed them not to pay my father back. And \u0152 and I remember, I have this one very vivid memory of waking up like one, two in the morning. We had like a bell, an old fashioned bell which you pull, in front of our house. And the bell pulled, and I went to the window, I woke up, and I saw a farmer standing there, with a cow. Because he did not \u0152 he wanted to transact a sale, but he did not want to be seen by anyone \u0152"
