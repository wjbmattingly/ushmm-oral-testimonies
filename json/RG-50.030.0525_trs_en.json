Because as you know, Hitler\u2019s having invaded the Soviet Union, Tito immediately declared war on the Germans under horrendous, horrendous circumstances for the partisans because they were nobodies, they had nothing, and yet they survived somehow. Tito is to me a -- a remarkable man, the way he took on the Nazis, but he also let his people suffer because it was because of the odd -- killing of some odd German soldier, the Germans were hanging hundreds and hundreds of innocent Serb civilians. And Tito added to power, exterminated the whole Yugoslav -- the whole -- the entire Yugoslav bourgeoisie. You see, Tito is a major was criminal, but without Tito the war couldn\u2019t have been won the way it has won, so I\u2019m kind of caught in between. One of my big images about that he -- from the war is an image that I retrieved from a book written by one of Tito\u2019s p- primary assistants [indecipherable] Angelis. You may have heard of Milo Angelis. He had a book on wartime memora -- memor -- memor -- memoirs in which on one particular cage -- page, there is a Serb young man about 18 years old, with a typical Serb cap, dressed like a poor peasant, standing under the gallows with that German officers surrounding him. And just before he died, he raised his hand like that, and he died like that. Now, if I ever wanted to have a photo over which I\u2019d cry about the absolute courage in the face of actual power, that guy is my hero in my mind. He was a total anti-Nazi, he who died because he believed that what Germans were doing was wrong. Trouble is his death was caused by T-Tito\u2019s partisan killing one or two Germans. And this guy was rounded up in a small village chacha and hanged with many of the others."

I think all of them, with the Jewish and -- you see, and then we said to ourself, what\u2019s that? And then Viel, who was our commanding officer, concentration camp Theresienstadt, our duty is to supervise 1500 to 2,000 inmates digging an anti-tank ditch, which the high command thought would have to be dug to hold back the Soviet tanks from a breakthrough. Suddenly, two things realized upon us. Number one, we had to supervise prisoners, which is not what officers are trained to do. Officer training is to become officers to fight the commies. Not being [indecipherable] you looked at those people they were ragged, they were kind of -- th-th-th--their -- their -- their -- to -- clothing was kind of all torn up, they were starving looking, they were t-totally inwarded looking.

And serious questions were raised, but you were given the command, so they were coming out, 1500 to 2,000 9 of them and we were si -- surrounded and marched with them where the commanding officer was- told him to march.

Now, I'll stop here, P\u2019Il go back. Okay, so on the second day we went back, we were brought by white truck. A number of prisoners, we didn\u2019t count them, I estimate between 1500 to 2,000. At the same time the ti -- the ditch was supposed to be two kilometers long. Now, two kilometers long is 2,000 meters. If you have 2,000 prisoners half starving, how can they possibly dig with just to shovel one meters worth of 20 meters across and up to two meters deep? So something -- my numbers may not be correct, or maybe the Germans were thinking that these guys were ready to work their butts off, hoping to survive. Anyway, SO we were again posted every 20 meters. I was on the right hand side, another guy was on the left hand side [indecipherable] both sides, and we had the weapons in our hands, and just watching them. Now, I was very close to a group of seven, and one of the seven -- like, they were a bit separate from the others, and the ditch was maybe about a meter deep, something like that, but unequally so. And the officer group was standing a bit higher up, about 20 meters away, with Viel among them, including the commanding officer of the school, and they were kind of chatting and looking and chatting and I was standing. I had to look this way, not that way, because once you\u2019re told where to guard your post you couldn\u2019t move even a foot of that. And if you had to make a pee you have to ask for permission to leave or to turn around. And suddenly I- I noticed that big, big guy with a big dark red beard, and just urging the others on to work, to work, to work. And one of the guys was -- the first one who got killed was a tiny little guy, almost no face left, like blue eyes, a little sparse hair, no chest, barely moving, t-tiny, maybe around 50-ish. And suddenly, I look -- I look at that, I hear something, there is Viel. Oh, we had put our weapons away for lunch, then we got our weapons back, but there were still some pyramids there because lunches were taken in sequence. So Viel goes to a pyramid, grabs a rifle, 4 and there could be more than three, could be four or five. So one of the witnesses said oh, when you grab a rifle of the three, the others four fall down. He took one of the four or five, stood up straight, aimed that and I said to myself, what -- wh -- I didn\u2019t know the word what the hell is happening, excuse me, what\u2019s happening. And I said, well maybe he\u2019s just limbering up or something. It was a muddy day for -- you know, springtime, mud in the river -- gri -- ditch. Raises the weapon and aims towards me. I didn\u2019t even duck because I said, what will -- and suddenly, he aims -- it doesn\u2019t take long to aim. And so I hear the shot and the little guy just falls down. Didn\u2019t even just hear the pop, falls down. He kind of fell down forward, and the military law is, if you hit the chest or the heart, you always fall forward, you never fall backward. Okay, so second shot, second guy falls down. And then a third shot, the big guy. And the big guy had stood up straight and he was looking at the officer, and the officer was looking at him. The big guy had the shovel, the officer had the gun. So the officer pulled the trigger, hits the big guy, the big guy falls down, stands up, raises his hand. Viel aims, shoots the second time, the big guy falls down. Stands up -- no more raised arm, stands up, still keeps on staring at Viel. Big guy. Legs like that. He must have been a capo because he looked better fed than the other guys. Viel, third time, plomp. Was in the face, whatever, fall down in the mud. Three shots, plus two shots, five shots, three dead guys. Foosh. Five shots. Carbine is not empty yet. Keeps on shooting, all the seven guys dead. He missed one shot, right? Puts the gun back, the carbine, goes back to the [indecipherable]. The officers had looked, turned around, joined the group, continued the discussion. Seven dead guys. A little while later, I\u2019m standing there, I\u2019m looking at the [indecipherable] I\u2019m looking at the guy behind me, in front of me [indecipherable] the thing. What the -- what -- what happened? What happened? Deep inside myself I was like a stone. Unable to bel -- unable to think. Wha -- I thought I\u2019d a -- I had an active mind, my mind never 5 falls asleep. I just -- petrified. I had never seen a dead Jew in my life. Suddenly I see seven dead Jew -- I never wanted to see a dead Jew. That\u2019s not why I was in war. All I was in war, to keep the commies off central Europe. Some of the commies were Jewish commissars. There was, as you well know, Hitler\u2019s personal command to kill the Jewish commissars, right? Never seen one, alive or dead. There were seven Jews. Say nothing, continue my guard duty. Didn\u2019t di -- don\u2019t step off the thing, cause you\u2019re not allowed. But -- I hear a noise. A two wheeler. A death cart. Typical of concentration camps, I found later on. Okay? Four guys were pushing, prisoners, Jewish, death guard -- 1t s-seemed like standard procedure. They\u2019d appeared from the nowhere, they were coming closer and closer, nobody touched them, nobody told them anything. Came to the ditch -- went to the ditch, put the cart -- I think they even got it somehow into the ditch and grabbed the little guy who had died first, no problem, two guys lift him up, bango on the [indecipherable]. Grabbed the second guy -- they needed all four of them to lift up the heavy guy. They had problems lifting up the heavy guy, so finally the [indecipherable] got him and the one, two three, all seven, turned the cart around, marched away. Death cart. Standard instrument of picking up the dead during the Nazi regime. Now, not even the commies in the Spanish Civil War were doing things like that."

I have to wait until the [indecipherable] which I got in [indecipherable] not from my father. And -- so there was no inside work on that. And so eventually we talked about the -- America.

You know, we are [indecipherable]. And he liked me, he said Lallier, you are -- in German [speaks German] I can reeducate you, do you like America? I said, I know nothing.

It was a sale, right? He said then, a little while later, and would you like to work for us? And I said, yes please, I need job. I need job badly. So he gave me a job as a stoveman in an American infantry company stationed in Bamberg. And stoveman was the most dangerous job in the army because they used gasoline stoves and every third of them was expected to explode into the stovemen\u2019s faces, right? And I said, stoveman? Sounds good to me. All the food you can eat, he said. So I got the job as a stoveman. I did a very good job. Not even one stove exploded while I was working in Bamberg for nine months. And he was pleased, he says, you seem highly useful, your English is getting better, your German and other languages, how about working for us? I said, doing what? He says, well, certain things we like to find out. You were in the Waffen SS for instance. What if we sent you to Switzerland to explore the escape routes of some higher SS officials through Switzerland to Latin America. And I\u2019m a humble guy, I [indecipherable] thinking of generals and colonels and all this. I said, why should I do that?

He said, well, go to Switzerland, try to get across the border. Make sure that they don\u2019t catch you because the Swiss will put you in jail for being Waffen SS [indecipherable] and Ill give you 200 American dollars. And try to fact find in the Basel area if there may have been someone on the streets, through which some of these Waffen S -- these SS [indecipherable] he emphasized strongly, seem to have go -- escaped and then to Latin America. So, he said, I\u2019ll give you two weeks to find out and report back to me. And I -- I found it very amusing, here I am a nobody -- oh, and he said, and if you do a good job on the other assignments, I'll try to get you a visa to emigrate to the United States.

I will report what you have just said, but there is nothing more that I can do about that because I am not a war crime discrimination -- I am not a war crime investigator.

I went there in person [indecipherable] I remember. And I learned that the commanding officer was a general, two star general by the name of Wood.

Including some of whom, from the real eastern Europe, who had turned out to have been members without saying so, right, of some concentration camp and Einsatz commandos, right? So I\u2019m looking at that parallel, wondering about the Canadian approaches between 1947 and 1949. Was it just to get as many bodies as 7 possible to replace the lost bodies during the war, right? And kind of wanting to be equal. So many Jewish people, so many non-Jew, I don\u2019t know, but the fact is that I did tell the Canadian consuls upon several visits who I was because they had to look at my background to find me trustworthy, right?

You could only ferret people over without proper identification during the lunch hour, because on the east side of Linz was a big steel factory which the cho -- Soviets had reopened right? And during the lunch hour, because feeding was poor on the east Soviet side, thousands of workers crossed the bridge and went to the western side where the food was much better, American zone. So it is there that I ferreted out many, including Mr. Goldstein and Mr. Goldsmith, who had been a very preeminent jeweler in -- 1n Budapest and who eventually got to Montreal and opened up the -- the coffee shop, which had become very famous as a little coffee shop, on Drummond Street.

And having experienced the German attempt to universal military power, I decided I\u2019d had enough of that. No more C.I.C..

So then I decided I\u2019d had enough. My wife says, look, I want peace and quiet; my daughter had been born. So I came to Canada and -- wanting to study. My credentials were good, my English was much better, my French was okay for Quebec, even though Quebec\u2019s accent is different from the French [indecipherable]. And I was a Protestant, so 0 in Quebec I found that Protestants were not really welcome, so I kind of deemphasized that. There was no immigration of French Protestants into Quebec from 1529 to 1929, can you imagine that? That\u2019s another thing that I didn\u2019t know about. Anyway, so I found meni -- menial jobs. I worked in a color dye factory, I worked in a -- in the gold mine. I worked as a shoe cleaner, I worked in a -- as a vacuum cleaner salesman. And I worked as a car washer. And let\u2019s see, I worked one more dirty job, in a barrel factory, I was a hole puncher. Concerned, cause I had learned a bit about democracy. I had been told about Jefferson. I had been told about the Constitution. I had been told about the duality of Canada, and my mind was so empty. I had known nothing about the systems. That kind of pleased my soul. And I was married, I had responsibility for the family. My wife was a haute couturiere, she had no problem finding a job. So I decided I would work with Steinbergs as a store manager for awhile to get money and go back to school. I went to the French university for admission, speaking in European French and having to answer -- one of the first questions was what religion are you? You are from Europe. I said well, look, I\u2019m of [indecipherable] origin. He said Protestants study at McGill. We cannot accept Protestants. And that was that. So my desire to match my heart with some of the French blood rest -- remaining in it, with the French heart of Canadian, didn\u2019t work. I went to McGill speaking colloquial English. Good for selling vacuum cleaners, but not good for studying Burke and Hume and Locke. And looked at the guy -- who looked Jewish, you know guys who look Jewish, who happen to be Jewish, right? You see it on their eyes. I said -- Solean was his name, Dean Solean, the first Jewish administrator at McGill in 1954. Okay, big, big difference. There had been no Jewish administrators before then, so McGill was kind of opening up. I said please, Austria born, speaking all kinds of languages, working for [indecipherable] America, please, I want to finish college. What certification do you have? Well, I ha -- in Vienna I studied two 1 years at the university -- and that\u2019s very impressive. It\u2019s like three years over here. So he looked at that, he says, look Lallier, I will accept you for a B.A. in economics and political science, and Pll put you into honors economics. Oh, I felt so pleased. You know what honors economics is? It\u2019s a special degree, undergrad, leading you direct into graduate school. I phoned my wife and said, oh my dear, I haven\u2019t even started, but already I have honors."

He says, but you first must spend another year learning English, because if I take you right now you'll fail, and I don\u2019t want you to fail, I see that you don\u2019t want to fail. So I ya -- I said, so what do I do? And there was something that I will never forget. Dean Solean looks at me, jee -- Jewish Canadian, free to have the first dean job at McGill, in a society in which the Jewish people were not easily accepted. Tells me, you know, Mr. Lallier, Canada\u2019s a great, free country. Do whatever you want. But come back the first of September 1954, I'll take you. And I said, great, free country. Nobody ever in my life had told me it\u2019s a great free country, you\u2019re free to what to do. My conversion to democracy and human freedom and individual freedom started blooming, but deep inside, the shame of what I had witnessed never died. So I went to McGill [indecipherable] learning English day and night, I was working 70 words a day, and with that good mind of mine it\u2019s working well, even s-started to write in, the [indecipherable] professor was very, very, very protective of me and encouraging. And I landed with a very high quality B honors economics, political science. Wrote out a few letters of reco -- of application. Lo and behold Columbia took me without restrictions, but with the restriction to study in the Russian Institute. Why? Lallier, we know that you know languages, we badly need you for your east European languages to be trained as a specialist in Soviet affairs, but you have to learn Russian. And I had a Russian teacher at Columbia who was a 2 young lady refugee from Leningrad. I don\u2019t know how she made it, oh she was so beautiful, I was studying Russian day and night, including some coffee sessions with the young lady, right, I remember that. And I felt I was really taking to Russian, everybody was pleased. So I got my Master\u2019s degree in economics in one year, which was unusual. I had my Russian [indecipherable] certificate in one additional year, which is unusual. And I was fully qualified for my Ph.D. in economics. All of that in two years. And then I got tired. The United States got the war in the Vietnam. I was suffering under this blatant expression of militarism under false philosophic and moral premises of [indecipherable] theory and all of that stuff, and I\u2019d become a person who had highly admired Jefferson, on the one hand, in spite of his dubious background lately, right, but also Locke. I\u2019m a [indecipherable] by conviction. And I decided I would come back to Canada, take up a teaching post, fini -- post, fish -- finish my doctorate somewhere along the line, but prefer a country of peace. Even though the country was supplying all the napalm the- America needed to bomb the hell out of Vietnam. So I came back home, came across some of my refugees that I brought here, including the guy who had opened the coffee shop, who gave me a permanent table like in Vienna. Adalbert, whenever you come -- in Hungarian -- this is your table, I give you my personal services. And he was very grateful. And some others I kept contact with, who was very grateful, and I had no problem getting my citizenship, even being invited to speak at a citizenship ceremony in both languages -- both official languages, no Austrian any more, did that. Recognizing the French Canadian identity, but also the need of English Canada to remain strong and united, so they liked that. So that was 1957. I went to the United States, lived in New York for three years, 1960 to 1963. Had a very good time on Broadway, working part time in a -- in a p -- ina -- ina chicken and sparerib store, a Jewish store on Broadway just off Columbia in which the owner told me, when you sell expensive cheeses, 3 always leave your thumb on the scale. And I told him, I can\u2019t do that. He says, if you want the job you\u2019d better do that, but also got a ska -- part-time ta -- I was very good at Columbia, actually, had an A average, at the graduate level. And the professor that chaired then said lall -- Lallier, you\u2019re really a very smart kid, he said, even though you\u2019re a bit older than the average kid, he says, I recommend you for a teaching job at Brooklyn College. So he got me a Brooklyn summer job [indecipherable] college, 1962 in the summer -- 1961 in the summer. And he said, I prefer you to stay in the United States and you don\u2019t need to have your doctorate 1n economics because with your advanced degrees, graduate degrees 1n international politics, I want you to work for the Rand Corporation. And the Rand Corporation is the air force\u2019s secret service, I wa - didn't want that. And I hope, I beg you to understand why I made up my mind that I would not continue living in the States. I love America for its ideals, for its honesty, for the greatest of, especially President Roosevelt. Not so much the subsequent ones. And for the liberating me, for a chance to develop my mind. But I prefer maybe being a small country member, because small countries can always prevent themselves from stepping under the toes. Big countries, by their size alone, cannot do that. I\u2019m a friend of the United States, I am very highly respective of you for giving me the honor of having this discussion and making my confession once again, hoping to convince you that when I applied that job -- for that job in General Woods\u2019s office, God had given me a mandate, and I\u2019m very serious about that, to try to undo, not so much my feelings of guilt, cause you can\u2019t do feelings of unguilt if you cannot prevent the killing of innocent people, but trying to do my best to ease the suffering of many of the Jewish refugees, especially those from Hungary and the Czechia -- and Czechoslovakia. And I think I have been able to follow through on my mandate in doing that, and thereby easing my pangs of conscience, hoping that eventually the maker, in the Christian tradition St. Peter, will look at me and say, oh Adalbert 4 you old rascal, you didn\u2019t do anything, did you? But you at least tried to redeem yourself and to help a people badly needed help [indecipherable] crucial time. It wasn\u2019t thousands of them, it was maybe just a couple of hundred. And the couple of hundred have had children, some of them I know even eight to 10 children. And it seems that they have forgiven me for doing nothing, even Rabbi Poupko. My conscience is still not pleased, because when you have to be a man, you have to be a man, even though it costs your life. \u2019' ve had moment -- in English you have the statement, if a man is a chicken, he is not a man.
