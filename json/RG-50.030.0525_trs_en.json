At the same time the ti -- the ditch was supposed to be two kilometers long. Now, two kilometers long is 2,000 meters. If you have 2,000 prisoners half starving, how can they possibly dig with just to shovel one meters worth of 20 meters across and up to two meters deep? So something -- my numbers may not be correct, or maybe the Germans were thinking that these guys were ready to work their butts off, hoping to survive. Anyway, SO we were again posted every 20 meters. I was on the right hand side, another guy was on the left hand side [indecipherable] both sides, and we had the weapons in our hands, and just watching them. Now, I was very close to a group of seven, and one of the seven -- like, they were a bit separate from the others, and the ditch was maybe about a meter deep, something like that, but unequally so. And the officer group was standing a bit higher up, about 20 meters away, with Viel among them, including the commanding officer of the school, and they were kind of chatting and looking and chatting and I was standing. I had to look this way, not that way, because once you\u2019re told where to guard your post you couldn\u2019t move even a foot of that. And if you had to make a pee you have to ask for permission to leave or to turn around. And suddenly I- I noticed that big, big guy with a big dark red beard, and just urging the others on to work, to work, to work. And one of the guys was -- the first one who got killed was a tiny little guy, almost no face left, like blue eyes, a little sparse hair, no chest, barely moving, t-tiny, maybe around 50-ish. And suddenly, I look -- I look at that, I hear something, there is Viel. Oh, we had put our weapons away for lunch, then we got our weapons back, but there were still some pyramids there because lunches were taken in sequence. So Viel goes to a pyramid, grabs a rifle, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So one of the witnesses said oh, when you grab a rifle of the three, the others four fall down. He took one of the four or five, stood up straight, aimed that and I said to myself, what -- wh -- I didn\u2019t know the word what the hell is happening, excuse me, what\u2019s happening. And I said, well maybe he\u2019s just limbering up or something. It was a muddy day for -- you know, springtime, mud in the river -- gri -- ditch. Raises the weapon and aims towards me. I didn\u2019t even duck because I said, what will -- and suddenly, he aims -- it doesn\u2019t take long to aim. And so I hear the shot and the little guy just falls down. Didn\u2019t even just hear the pop, falls down. He kind of fell down forward, and the military law is, if you hit the chest or the heart, you always fall forward, you never fall backward. Okay, so second shot, second guy falls down. And then a third shot, the big guy. And the big guy had stood up straight and he was looking at the officer, and the officer was looking at him. The big guy had the shovel, the officer had the gun. So the officer pulled the trigger, hits the big guy, the big guy falls down, stands up, raises his hand. Viel aims, shoots the second time, the big guy falls down. Stands up -- no more raised arm, stands up, still keeps on staring at Viel. Big guy. Legs like that. He must have been a capo because he looked better fed than the other guys. Viel, third time, plomp. Was in the face, whatever, fall down in the mud. Three shots, plus two shots, five shots, three dead guys. Foosh. Five shots. Carbine is not empty yet. Keeps on shooting, all the seven guys dead. He missed one shot, right? Puts the gun back, the carbine, goes back to the [indecipherable]. The officers had looked, turned around, joined the group, continued the discussion. Seven dead guys.

I just -- petrified. I had never seen a dead Jew in my life. Suddenly I see seven dead Jew -- I never wanted to see a dead Jew. That\u2019s not why I was in war. All I was in war, to keep the commies off central Europe. Some of the commies were Jewish commissars. There was, as you well know, Hitler\u2019s personal command to kill the Jewish commissars, right? Never seen one, alive or dead. There were seven Jews. Say nothing, continue my guard duty. Didn\u2019t di -- don\u2019t step off the thing, cause you\u2019re not allowed. But -- I hear a noise. A two wheeler. A death cart. Typical of concentration camps, I found later on. Okay? Four guys were pushing, prisoners, Jewish, death guard -- 1t s-seemed like standard procedure. They\u2019d appeared from the nowhere, they were coming closer and closer, nobody touched them, nobody told them anything. Came to the ditch -- went to the ditch, put the cart -- I think they even got it somehow into the ditch and grabbed the little guy who had died first, no problem, two guys lift him up, bango on the [indecipherable]. Grabbed the second guy -- they needed all four of them to lift up the heavy guy. They had problems lifting up the heavy guy, so finally the [indecipherable] got him and the one, two three, all seven, turned the cart around, marched away. Death cart.

And we went into the klanifesto, into the small fortress to ask some questions, and we were allowed to go in because we were fully uniformed, right? So we went around and we came across a couple of subalterns who looked at us like as equal because we were not yet officers and who showed us, well this is the wall against which the shooting is done. That is the wall in which [indecipherable] and the wall against which some of the hanging is done. This is where some of them perished trying to jump across the fence.

But we never went to higher command, because given our lower -- lower rank, we were just happy to have been tolerated in there asking a few questions.

Now, the second question is, why would we have been sent there in the first place? There were other military uniform -- military units in the area. And I\u2019m coming back to the main thesis. I think I\u2019m right in presuming that the real Nazis in the Waffen SS command wanted to give a last minute test to our affiliation with Nazism as an ideology.

There was no immigration of French Protestants into Quebec from 1529 to 1929, can you imagine that? That\u2019s another thing that I didn\u2019t know about. Anyway, so I found meni -- menial jobs.

And let\u2019s see, I worked one more dirty job, in a barrel factory, I was a hole puncher. Concerned, cause I had learned a bit about democracy. I had been told about Jefferson. I had been told about the Constitution. I had been told about the duality of Canada, and my mind was so empty. I had known nothing about the systems. That kind of pleased my soul. And I was married, I had responsibility for the family. My wife was a haute couturiere, she had no problem finding a job. So I decided I would work with Steinbergs as a store manager for awhile to get money and go back to school. I went to the French university for admission, speaking in European French and having to answer -- one of the first questions was what religion are you? You are from Europe.

Good for selling vacuum cleaners, but not good for studying Burke and Hume and Locke. And looked at the guy -- who looked Jewish, you know guys who look Jewish, who happen to be Jewish, right? You see it on their eyes. I said -- Solean was his name, Dean Solean, the first Jewish administrator at McGill in 1954. Okay, big, big difference.

It\u2019s like three years over here. So he looked at that, he says, look Lallier, I will accept you for a B.A. in economics and political science, and Pll put you into honors economics. Oh, I felt so pleased. You know what honors economics is? It\u2019s a special degree, undergrad, leading you direct into graduate school.

Nobody ever in my life had told me it\u2019s a great free country, you\u2019re free to what to do.

I don\u2019t know how she made it, oh she was so beautiful, I was studying Russian day and night, including some coffee sessions with the young lady, right, I remember that. And I felt I was really taking to Russian, everybody was pleased. So I got my Master\u2019s degree in economics in one year, which was unusual. I had my Russian [indecipherable] certificate in one additional year, which is unusual. And I was fully qualified for my Ph.D. in economics. All of that in two years. And then I got tired. The United States got the war in the Vietnam. I was suffering under this blatant expression of militarism under false philosophic and moral premises of [indecipherable] theory and all of that stuff, and I\u2019d become a person who had highly admired Jefferson, on the one hand, in spite of his dubious background lately, right, but also Locke. I\u2019m a [indecipherable] by conviction. And I decided I would come back to Canada, take up a teaching post, fini -- post, fish -- finish my doctorate somewhere along the line, but prefer a country of peace. Even though the country was supplying all the napalm the- America needed to bomb the hell out of Vietnam. So I came back home, came across some of my refugees that I brought here, including the guy who had opened the coffee shop, who gave me a permanent table like in Vienna.

So on the one hand I wanted to feel him out. On the other hand I wanted to play this -- this red herring of military hierarchy and the level of responsibility. So I wrote him a personal letter, he was General Kumm, he was the second [indecipherable] general of my division, but it took him away from [indecipherable] and he wasn\u2019t hanged because of that. The seven other commanders were all hanged by the Titoists, and I think justifiably so, including a German Field Marshall. So I wrote to Kumm and surprisingly got an answer. I said, I have to account for you as the highest remaining Waffen SS ranking officer -- he was a brigadier, at the brigadier level, to account for you for the deed by Julius Viel then and then, involving seven Jews that they killed in the Panzergraben. And -- not for permission, okay, I want you to tell me if, from what you know about military discipline and military command structures if this can be looked at as a war crime. He wrote me a letter, personal letter, signing it. I have original letter in his own handwriting, from a Waffen SS brigadier who has since died about two years ago at the age of 92. He says, Dr. Lallier, because I put in my full credential to make it [indecipherable], he said, Dr. Lallier, I am reporting received of your letter, your inquiry, and all that I can say is that in my view -- I\u2019m translating now from the German -- in my view, any Waffen SS man or Waffen SS officer who commits a war crime ceases being member of the Waffen SS.

Because if you had done something about the first one getting killed, they\u2019d kil -- they\u2019d have killed you and the other six anyway. But I cannot accept that because again, th-th-the harder view, a man being a man, in a context of a civil society in which killing is murder. And racially induced killing is the ultimate crime, let\u2019s say. Extermination of a whole people. What does a man do with that? Do I grab the gun? I didn\u2019t grab the gun. And I watched the other six. So, by doing nothing, Viel was able to do whatever he had wanted to do.  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.
