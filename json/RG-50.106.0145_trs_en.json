He started his business in the -- what was it? A laundry ho- house that my grandparents had. And he got on a bicycle and he started to build up his own business. That was in 1923. And th-the town was about 1500 people, a small Jewish congregation of about 15 families. My grandfather was the Gabbai of the congregation and I remember on Shabbas carrying out the aliyahs to the members o-of the synagogue. And I grew up, a relatively normal life, just before Hitler, and then in 1932, I started high school in the city of Eisenart. High school was not compulsory, it was voluntary. There was a small tuition but not significant. I started there \u201932, and I went to school by train. At the ol -- the s-students that traveled by train, traveled in one compartment. When Hitler came to power April 30\", 1933, they kicked me out of the compartment, they beat me up through the train, they chased me. In the beginning it was pretty bad, that I stayed with in the city of Eisenart for a couple of weeks, and then I got back on the train and stayed home again. In school not much changed, that depended on the individual teacher. I can say the gym teacher used me to dust off the equipment. He made me sit on the equipment and he dusted [indecipherable] with my gym pants. There were This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So he made a decision that he wanted to leave. I have something else to [indecipherable], which I forgot.

He wanted to leave Germany right then and there, in 1933, and my mother said here -- I was born here, she said, I\u2019m supposed to leave? My grandparents said, oh he was voted in, he\u2019Il be voted out again. Th-Then, as I said, in \u201935, he -- we had -- the business wa-was gone and we had to leave.

And he would take them to the nearest Jewish community in Fendler. And they would then help these people to get further into Holland for -- then they were allowed to stay.

Some came over blind and somehow wound up with us. Since we had a boarding house in addition to being farmers -- also the Dutch border police would bring them to us while they would try to get permission to stay. One or two did, but most of them didn\u2019t. I mean, they put them across the border they could turn around, come right back. But what really happened to most of them, we don\u2019t know. I know one man, he went back up in Vienna.

I remember there was a case of a German prisoner of war who had lockjaw. And somehow they found out I spoke German, so they took me and our doctor and a nurse into that room. The doctor wanted to give him massive dose of antitoxin, and I had to translate to the German medic what they were going to do. I really don\u2019t know whether the man survived or not. I stayed there a little while longer and then I wound up again in the field replacement hospital, where I volunteered for KP on Christmas. I had experienced that on Jewish holidays I didn\u2019t have to -- to work, so I figured here let\u2019s have somebody Christian have a chance to have the day off. So on Christmas I volunteered KP duty. Came back to my outfit -- what was happen -- November sixth -- around January sixth or seventh, and first to the kitchen and then they brought me up front. And we were in a position right in the Maginot Line. And we were pretty scared to begin with. But a infantry platoon is 40 men when they are full strength. When I came back, my platoon was 20 men, of which I knew 10. So you can imagine what they had gone through while I was away.

And the Germans for some reason or other, put up stiff resistance, very stiff. Some companies had gotten across the Neckar river, we were still on the other side. But then we had to go across. And on broad daylight, under German fire, we crossed the river. Not everybody made it. Then we went up the hill and through the Knorr soup f-factory that was on top of the hill. And the tanks of the soup concentrate had been hit with artillery. We actually went up the hill in Knorr concentrate. And we had to take the factory. After we took the factory, we had then take -- fought street by street to take the city of Heidelberg. I mean, the Germans were just unbelievable.

And then I went to military government and I wound up in a county right next to the county where my father came from. And th -- this was the northernmost county in the American zone, and that was the first county in the British zone. And there was an uncle and aunt of my father\u2019s that had come back from Theresienstadt. And of course I went to see them. And everybody in the States sent me packages for them.

We had hurricanes. Oh yeah, hurricane Hazel, and -- destroyed in our area many chicken coops. In 1955 I decided I couldn\u2019t make a living on the farm, because my wife\u2019s paycheck had to go to the feed dealer to pay for the feed bill. So, my father had a small route, detail route in the Haddonfield, Haddon Heights area, Cherry Hill came just in existence. So I decided in *55, I\u2019m going to start knocking doors. And after a year or two I built up my own route and I built up my own business, and worked well."

Ribbentrop, Papen, I mean all -- I knew the German governments then, and I knew who did what, and we knew who was lying. And I was not asked, you know, to get involved.

And then, my sister-in-law lived here for over 20 years, and she\u2019s said the home here in Washington is much better, so we had her transferred to the Hebrew home. And for me again, one of the personal reasons, I tried to slowly liquidate my business. I\u2019d gotten to a point where I was making many monthly deliveries, many deliveries twice a month, and when I decided I was going to go only monthly deliveries, then we decided to come here. Also religious reason. The synagogue in Vineland where I went to on Shabbas closed down. And the oth -- there was another synagogue but on Shabbas I had to walk 40 minutes, and I was getting a little too old for that. And then here, where we moved to, I have a 10 minute walk to synagogue. We are walking distance to four different Orthodox synagogues and -- and from a kosher point of view everything 1s right at your fingertips. I\u2019m enjoying it."

And you were telling me about your -- your visit to Germany. Was that the only time since the war that you\u2019ve been to Germany?",

This time, my sister-in-law, we went together again, the two couples. And our oldest son came to Cologne and to -- they went from cemetery to cemetery to look up the places where the family, my wife\u2019s family came from. And we went to the house where my mother-in-law was born and you know, many places like that. We went to the house where my wife grew up. But that was just recently. When I was back in Germany, that was the city of Cologne and they invited people that were born in the Cologne area, there were 40 people, 20 from ger -- from U.S. and 20 from Israel. That was a very interesting experience, but I don\u2019t think it showed us much, that the Germans had changed that much. I know this, Friday night they took us to synagogue by bus and then we walked back to the hotel. And they had two men walking bus -- us, officially that we wouldn\u2019t get lost. I think it was for security reasons. They were -- in \u201987, I mean there\u2019s -- Germany 1s still you don\u2019t feel a hundred percent secure. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.
