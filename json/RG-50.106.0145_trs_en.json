            "question": "Can you tell me about your hometown? Was it big or small, or --",
            "answer": "That was not really my hometown. My father was a manager of a farm supply business, and in 1922 - \u201923, there was the inflation in Germany and things were pretty bad for my grandparents in the town of Herleshausen, which is in the center part of Germany near the city of Eisenart. And my father came in \u201923, and he Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Werner Katzenstein \u00b0 October 17, 2001 again started to form his own business of farm supplies, which was really the -- the family business, my grandfather had it, uncles had it and th-they dealt with farmers, buying and selling. He started his business in the -- what was it? A laundry ho- house that my grandparents had. And he got on a bicycle and he started to build up his own business. That was in 1923. And th-the town was about 1500 people, a small Jewish congregation of about 15 families. My grandfather was the Gabbai of the congregation and I remember on Shabbas carrying out the aliyahs to the members o-of the synagogue. And I grew up, a relatively normal life, just before Hitler, and then in 1932, I started high school in the city of Eisenart. High school was not compulsory, it was voluntary. There was a small tuition but not significant. I started there \u201932, and I went to school by train. At the ol -- the s-students that traveled by train, traveled in one compartment. When Hitler came to power April 30\", 1933, they kicked me out of the compartment, they beat me up through the train, they chased me. In the beginning it was pretty bad, that I stayed with in the city of Eisenart for a couple of weeks, and then I got back on the train and stayed home again. In school not much changed, that depended on the individual teacher. I can say the gym teacher used me to dust off the equipment. He made me sit on the equipment and he dusted [indecipherable] with my gym pants. There were Interview with Werner Katzenstein , October 17, 2001 swimming lessons. We were three Jewish boys in a class, we were completely ignorant. So that was \u2019\u00b033, and the next step was my father\u2019s business."

            "answer": "My father na -- father\u2019s name was Joseph Katzenstein and my mother\u2019s name was Irma. He eventually built up a very good sized business that he had first a man with horse and wagon making deliveries. Much later on he bought a truck and the same man become a truck driver. My mother was in the office, she had the office, and they sold feed -- seeds, to the farmers, and also bought grain and so on from the farmers that my father sold to the mills.

            "answer": "I had one brother who survived, and he lives in the Detroit area. My father\u2019s -- the German government prohibited my father to buy grain from the farmer, and that stopped the business because the farmer could not buy from him any more. So he made a decision that he wanted to leave. I have something else to [indecipherable], which I forgot. In 1933, when Hitler came to power, in our county, every Jewish man was put in the county prison. My father was in there for about eight, 10 days. They were mistreated, but he didn\u2019t tel -- talk too much about it. He wanted to leave Germany right then and there, in 1933, and my mother said here -- I was born here, she said, I\u2019m supposed to leave? My grandparents said, oh he was voted in, he\u2019Il be voted out again. Th-Then, as I said, in \u201935, he -- we had -- the business wa-was gone and we had to leave. He decided where -- anywhere, but bor -- boundaries weren\u2019t open. He had an uncle which lived near Holland and he was able to buy two properties in Holland belonging to people in Germany. You were only allowed to take 10 marks out of Germany, but he bought two properties in Holland, and then we were allowed to move to Holland. This was 1937. And we had a boarding house, we had cows. I started farming with a big Belgian horse and what else could we do?"

And we got almost ready to take everything we wanted except they wouldn\u2019t permit my father to take a new car. He wanted to take a new car and they said no way. A -- a little sidelight. My father was suing the German government then, for a tax matter. And they told him, if you sue the German government, we won\u2019t let you go. So, of course he had to drop that.

He wanted to leave in \u00b033, he certainly wanted to go on. And of course, he wanted to take as many [indecipherable] from Germany with him. He tried South America, you name it, anything. We weren\u2019t registered anywhere. And he once had permission to go to England to take -- start a training farm for the [indecipherable]. And while he was in Amsterdam to get his visa, or permit, whatever, he ran into a German Jewish attorney who knew the immigration laws. And he said, you\u2019re a farmer? You don\u2019t go to England, you go to United States. My father said, how can I go to United States, I\u2019m not even registered in the quota. A skilled farmer will be automatically inserted in the quota. So we had to present to the American consulate in Interview with Werner Katzenstein \u00b0 October 17, 2001 Rotterdam, my father\u2019s background and we got permission to come to United States. A little sidelight here. My mother\u2019s father, my grandfather had come to us, to live with us in Holland after we had applied to come to the United States, and of course we wanted to take him with us. And sad to say that the American consul in Rotterdam was anti-Semitic. He told my father, if he asks me once more, I won\u2019t get you go. So my grandfather stayed in Amsterdam with a cousin of my father\u2019s, and he died a natural death in 1941. But the cousin, husband, they got killed.

            "answer": "Very much so. As I said, we lived along the border, and people came to us illegally and we had a sort of an underground railroad, where we would help the people that came in, got a taxi for him in the town of Arcen, where we lived. And he would take them to the nearest Jewish community in Fendler. And they would then help these people to get further into Holland for -- then they were allowed to stay. I mean, we had cases where people went right back. One of the Dutch border policemen ha -- was forced to put some people back into Germany, and he told me, I won\u2019t do that again. And you know, thing -- when they were caught they were done for. This was right after Kristallnacht, yeah. Yeah, tha -- there wasn\u2019t much Interview with Werner Katzenstein \u201d October 17, 2001 after that.

Some came over blind and somehow wound up with us. Since we had a boarding house in addition to being farmers -- also the Dutch border police would bring them to us while they would try to get permission to stay. One or two did, but most of them didn\u2019t. I mean, they put them across the border they could turn around, come right back. But what really happened to most of them, we don\u2019t know. I know one man, he went back up in Vienna. And we even moved from our farm after we sold, to another town near Fendler called Blerick, and he wrote to Mr. Katzenstein, near Fendler, and the letter got to us.

In those days the subway was a nickel. And we went out there to look and the thing that impressed me most was the ice water dispenser at the General Elec -- General Motors exhibit. That impressed me most. My mother was very disappointed. There was a place that sold root beer and it didn\u2019t taste at all like the beer she expected. We looked for farms and as I said, we bought a place with three houses. The first we moved into one house, good one -- two story, and Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Werner Katzenstein \" October 17, 2001 then we sold the two newer houses to je -- also German Jewish families that had come.

Water, we had a well, and we had a -- we had a pump 1n there, and we couldn\u2019t afford a deep well pump, so a plumber came and he built a platform in the well from which a regular pump could supply us with water. There was a Jewish plumber in Camden who would underwrite a loan so we could build a heating system, which of course he built. So we got a heating system, we got hot water and we started farming. At first I worked with a team of horses. Took a few years til we could afford a tractor, but again, we raised chicken feed. We grew corn, we grew wheat, and that we used for a chicken feed.

And then, eventually, we got ready to go. I think, yeah, it was Yom Kippur when we left Fort Bragg and we went on to Camp Kilmer in New Jersey. We only spent a few days there. Since I was close to home I got permission to go home a couple of times. But then when we boarded the transport and we ar -- and we\u2019re in a convoy of the hundred infantry division. We left about that time, we arrived [indecipherable] Gibraltar in the Marseilles area around November first. And then we went up through the mountains t -- into the Vosges mountain range. We actually went on the line around septem -- November first and -- where we relieved the 45\" infantry division. We went out on a patrol and I think the patrol of my first platoon was the first combat action of the division. And we went back and then we got into combat from -- attacked a few towns, took a few towns. And on the sixth or seventh November in the town of [indecipherable], I got wounded. You know, the saying is you take the town and the high ground beyond it. The Germans were on the high ground. We were in the town. And I was lucky I got not -- I got wounded and came out to a field hospital -- or a field hospital to a -- in a battalion he -- first aid station, then to a field hospital where they operated on me to remove the shrapnel from the wound. It was in my buttock. And I remember clearly s -- Interview with Werner Katzenstein \u201c October 17, 2001 everyone saying, who do we have here? Katzenstein, pronounced in perfect German. And I was hoping this wasn\u2019t a German doctor. Anyhow, I woke up the next day in a field hospital, believe it or not, a German, wounded German prisoner of war was lying next to me. Curiosity, I started talking to him. All I have to give you is my name and number. He wouldn\u2019t talk to me. Maybe he thought we were pulling a trick, but I was there and then I was -- I don\u2019t know, four or five, six days. Then we were put on a train to get to the nearest hospital, I think at Besancon. And on that train there were only sitting and walking patients. I couldn\u2019t sit. They had to put up a stretcher for me in the supply car. And I was there a few days. There was some movie actress with us, I don\u2019t remember who it was. And as I said in the beginning I was classified lightly wounded. They took me now off on a stretcher and I stayed there, I don\u2019t know, a week or so. And there they sewed up the buttock wound. Stayed there, I don\u2019t remember, til they thought I was well enough. And the doctor was very kind. A milit -- a medical officer is out to get you back to the front too mu -- as quick as possible. A doctor was try to keep you in the hospital as long as possible. And this one said, evacuation to the rear."

And stayed there for Interview with Werner Katzenstein ot October 17, 2001 awhile. I remember there was a case of a German prisoner of war who had lockjaw. And somehow they found out I spoke German, so they took me and our doctor and a nurse into that room. The doctor wanted to give him massive dose of antitoxin, and I had to translate to the German medic what they were going to do. I really don\u2019t know whether the man survived or not. I stayed there a little while longer and then I wound up again in the field replacement hospital, where I volunteered for KP on Christmas. I had experienced that on Jewish holidays I didn\u2019t have to -- to work, so I figured here let\u2019s have somebody Christian have a chance to have the day off. So on Christmas I volunteered KP duty. Came back to my outfit -- what was happen -- November sixth -- around January sixth or seventh, and first to the kitchen and then they brought me up front. And we were in a position right in the Maginot Line. And we were pretty scared to begin with. But a infantry platoon is 40 men when they are full strength. When I came back, my platoon was 20 men, of which I knew 10. So you can imagine what they had gone through while I was away. But from then on, through the end of fighting -- I mean, I had some more experiences, but combat was combat. We went through the Siegfried line, we went down towards Mannheim. One thing, once we were in Germany we didn\u2019t dig f -- dig foxholes any more, we slept in houses. And one of the worst battle ec -- battle experience I had was the city of Heidelberg. Heidelberg was sort of on a hill at the Interview with Werner Katzenstein \u201c October 17, 2001 Neckar river. And the Germans for some reason or other, put up stiff resistance, very stiff. Some companies had gotten across the Neckar river, we were still on the other side. But then we had to go across. And on broad daylight, under German fire, we crossed the river. Not everybody made it. Then we went up the hill and through the Knorr soup f-factory that was on top of the hill. And the tanks of the soup concentrate had been hit with artillery. We actually went up the hill in Knorr concentrate. And we had to take the factory. After we took the factory, we had then take -- fought street by street to take the city of Heidelberg. I mean, the Germans were just unbelievable. Then we had finally took the garrison, which they were still holding. And after we took that, they gave up -- at the le -- what was left, they left. And that -- a day or two, I -- later I was supposed to go on furlough, and I remember they sent me back to battalion headquarters, and that was the morning that President Roosevelt died. Company captain that I knew told us that Roosevelt had died. Went on furlough, first they put us into a German town, but then they decided no more resort in Germany, and we were sent on to France. Then spent there a few days, went back -- Passover they pulled us off the front line and gave a Seder in a German hotel. The hundred infantry division had a Jewish chaplain, Herbert Eskin was the name, I remember him well. And we had a Seder there. Wasn\u2019t much of a Seder, you know, but you were away from combat for a few Interview with Werner Katzenstein oS October 17, 2001 days, and then we went back. And I don\u2019t remember the date when we stopped fighting. When we got to the outskirts of Stuttgart, we actually went into occupation. We occupied a town here, occupied at town there. And that was the end of combat. The war was -- wasn\u2019t over yet. I tried to get to military government. I mean, I figured I had enough at the end of the [inaudible]. But -- went to the nearest -- no, I wrote to military government. A friend of mine was the sec -- the company clerk. And we wrote and they sent back, sorry, it has to go through channels. So it went through channels. Company commander who during combat wouldn\u2019t let me go, when he came back, he okayed my transfer. And then I went to military government and I wound up in a county right next to the county where my father came from. And th -- this was the northernmost county in the American zone, and that was the first county in the British zone. And there was an uncle and aunt of my father\u2019s that had come back from Theresienstadt. And of course I went to see them. And everybody in the States sent me packages for them. And then military government was very interesting. It was the starting up of German government. First we -- they needed travel permission for anything they w-wanted to go. The starting of political parties -- at first political parties were only permitted on the county level, and then, of course it spread. And -- Interview with Werner Katzenstein a October 17, 2001"

And then, my sister-in-law lived here for over 20 years, and she\u2019s said the home here in Washington is much better, so we had her transferred to the Hebrew home. And for me again, one of the personal reasons, I tried to slowly liquidate my business. I\u2019d gotten to a point where I was making many monthly deliveries, many deliveries twice a month, and when I decided I was going to go only monthly deliveries, then we decided to come here. Also religious reason. The synagogue in Vineland where I went to on Shabbas closed down. And the oth -- there was another synagogue but on Shabbas I had to walk 40 minutes, and I was getting a little too old for that. And then here, where we moved to, I have a 10 minute walk to synagogue. We are walking distance to four different Orthodox synagogues and -- and from a kosher point of view everything 1s right at your fingertips. I\u2019m enjoying it."

            "answer": "Yes. No, no, we were recently, but that had no connection. We were back recently going to Belgium, going to Germany, and to Amsterdam. This time, my sister-in-law, we went together again, the two couples. And our oldest son came to Cologne and to -- they went from cemetery to cemetery to look up the places where the family, my wife\u2019s family came from. And we went to the house where my mother-in-law was born and you know, many places like that. We went to the house where my wife grew up. But that was just recently. When I was back in Germany, that was the city of Cologne and they invited people that were born in the Cologne area, there were 40 people, 20 from ger -- from U.S. and 20 from Israel. That was a very interesting experience, but I don\u2019t think it showed us much, that the Germans had changed that much. I know this, Friday night they took us to synagogue by bus and then we walked back to the hotel. And they had two men walking bus -- us, officially that we wouldn\u2019t get lost. I think it was for security reasons. They were -- in \u201987, I mean there\u2019s -- Germany 1s still you don\u2019t feel a hundred percent secure.
