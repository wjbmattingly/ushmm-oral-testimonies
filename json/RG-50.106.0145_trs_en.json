And then, eventually, we got ready to go. I think, yeah, it was Yom Kippur when we left Fort Bragg and we went on to Camp Kilmer in New Jersey . We only spent a few days there. Since I was cl ose to home I got permission to go home a couple of times. But then when we boarded th e transport and we ar -- and we\u2122re in a convoy of the hundred infantry division. We left about that time, we arrived [indecipherable] Gibraltar in the Marseilles area around November first. And then we went up through the mountains t -- into the Vosges mountain range. We actually went on the line around septem -- November first and -- where we relieved the 45th infantry division. We went out on a pa trol and I think the patrol of my first platoon was the first combat action of the division. And we went back and then we got into combat from -- attacked a few town s, took a few towns. And on the sixth or seventh November in the town of [indecipherable], I got wounded. You know, the saying is you take the town and the hi gh ground beyond it. Th e Germans were on the high ground. We were in the town. And I was lucky I got not -- I got wounded and came out to a field hospital -- or a fiel d hospital to a -- in a battalion he -- first aid station, then to a field hospital wh ere they operated on me to remove the shrapnel from the wound. It was in my buttock. And I remember clearly s -- Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 20everyone saying, who do we have here? Katzenstein, pronounced in perfect German. And I was hoping this wasn\u2122t a German doctor. Anyhow, I woke up the next day in a field hospital, believe it or not, a German, wounded German prisoner of war was lying next to me. Curiosity, I started talking to him. All I have to give you is my name and number. He wouldn\u2122t talk to me. Maybe he thought we were pulling a trick, but I was there and then I was -- I don\u2122t know, four or five, six days. Then we were put on a train to get to the nearest hospital, I think at Besan\u00e7on . And on that train there were only sitting and walking patients. I couldn\u2122t sit. They had to put up a stretcher for me in the supply car. And I was there a few days. There was some movie actress with us, I don\u2122t remember who it was. And as I said in the beginning I was classified lightly wounde d. They took me now off on a stretcher and I stayed there, I don\u2122t know, a week or so. And there they sewed up the buttock wound. Stayed there, I don\u2122t remember, til they thought I was well enough. And the doctor was very kind. A milit -- a medical officer is out to get you back to the front too mu -- as quick as possible. A doctor was try to keep you in the hospital as long as possible. And this one said, evacuation to the rear."

            "answer": "To the rear. And I wound up in a ho spital which at one time had been a -- a German hospital, a army hospital in the Exon Provence. And stayed there for Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 21awhile. I remember there was a case of a German prisoner of war who had lockjaw. And somehow they found out I spoke German , so they took me and our doctor and a nurse into that room. The doctor wanted to give him massive dose of antitoxin, and I had to translate to the German medic what they were going to do. I really don\u2122t know whether the man surv ived or not. I stayed there a little while longer and then I wound up again in the field replacement hospital, where I volunteered for KP on Christmas. I had experienced that on Jewi sh holidays I didn\u2122t ha ve to -- to work, so I figured here let\u2122s have somebody Chri stian have a chance to have the day off. So on Christmas I volunteered KP duty. Came back to my outfit -- what was happen -- November sixth -- around Januar y sixth or seventh, and first to the kitchen and then they brought me up front. And we were in a position right in the Maginot Line. And we were pretty scared to begin with. But a infantry platoon is 40 men when they are full strength. When I came back, my platoon was 20 men, of which I knew 10. So you can imagine what they had gone through while I was away. But from then on, through the end of fighting -- I mean, I had some more experiences, but combat was co mbat. We went through the Siegfried line, we went down towards Mannheim. One thing, once we were in Germany we didn\u2122t dig f -- dig foxholes any more, we slept in houses. And one of the worst battle ec -- battle experience I had was the city of Heidelberg. Heidelberg was sort of on a hill at the Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 22Neckar river. And the Germans for some reason or other, put up stiff resistance, very stiff. Some companies had gotten across the Neckar river, we were still on the other side. But then we had to go across. And on broad daylight, under German fire, we crossed the river. Not everybody made it. Then we went up the hill and through the Knorr soup f-factory that was on top of the hill. And the tanks of the soup concentrate had been hit with artillery. We actually went up the hill in Knorr concentrate. And we had to take the factor y. After we took the factory, we had then take -- fought street by street to take the city of Heidelberg. I mean, the Germans were just unbelievable. Then we had finally took the garrison, which they were still holding. And after we took that , they gave up -- at the le -- what was left, they left. And that -- a day or two, I -- later I was supposed to go on furlough, and I remember they sent me ba ck to battalion headquarters, and that was the morning that President Roosevelt died. Company captain that I knew told us that Roosevelt had died. Went on furlough, first they put us into a German town, but then they decided no more resort in Germany, and we were sent on to France . Then spent there a few days, went back -- Passover they pulled us off the front line and gave a Seder in a German hotel. The hundred infantry division had a Jewish chaplain, Herbert Eskin was the name, I remember him well. And we had a Seder there. Wasn\u2122t much of a Seder, you know, but you were away from combat for a few Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 23days, and then we went ba ck. And I don\u2122t remember the date when we stopped fighting. When we got to the outskirts of Stuttgart, we actually went into occupation. We occupied a town here, occupi ed at town there. And that was the end of combat. The war was -- wasn\u2122t over yet. I tried to get to military government. I mean, I figured I had enough at the end of the [inaudible]. But -- went to the nearest -- no, I wrote to military government. A friend of mine was the sec -- the company clerk. And we wrote and they sent back, sorry, it has to go through channels. So it went through channels. Company commander who during combat wouldn\u2122t let me go, when he came back, he okayed my transfer. And then I went to military government and I wound up in a county right next to the county where my father came from. And th -- this was the northernmost county in the American zone, and that was the first county in the British zone. And there was an uncle and aunt of my father\u2122s that had come back from Theresienstadt. And of course I went to see them. And everybody in the States sent me packages for them. And then military government was very interesting. It was the starting up of German government. First we -- they needed travel permission for anything they wwanted to go. The starting of political parties -- at first political parties were only permitted on the county level, and then, of course it spread. And -- Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 24"

            "answer": "There were several reasons. Number one, my wife\u2122s mother had been mentally deteriorated, and we ha -- and physically also. We had her in a home in Atlantic Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 33City. And then, my sister-in-law lived here for over 20 years, and she\u2122s said the home here in Washington is much better, so we had her transferred to the Hebrew home. And for me again, one of the persona l reasons, I tried to slowly liquidate my business. I\u2122d gotten to a point where I was making many monthly deliveries, many deliveries twice a month, and when I decided I was going to go only monthly deliveries, then we decided to come here . Also religious reason. The synagogue in Vineland where I went to on Shabbas closed down. And the oth -- there was another synagogue but on Shabbas I had to walk 40 minutes, and I was getting a little too old for that. And then here, where we moved to, I have a 10 minute walk to synagogue. We are walking distance to four different Orthodox synagogues and -- and from a kosher point of view everything is right at your fingertips. I\u2122m enjoying it."

We go in at least one day a week and it\u2122s sometimes not so nice to do what we\u2122re doing because we Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 34can read between the lines how people are suffering, and most of the correspondence that we translate is of people that did not survive.

Our former next door neighbor is a schoolteacher here in the Montgomery County, or Howard County , I don\u2122t know. And she arranged for us to speak to a public school, one day not long ago.

            "answer": "Yes. No, no, we were recently, but that had no connection. We were back recently going to Belgium, going to Germany, and to Amsterdam. This time, my sister-in-law, we went together again, th e two couples. And our oldest son came to Cologne and to -- they went from cemetery to cemetery to look up the places where the family, my wife\u2122s family came from. And we went to the house where my mother-in-law was born and you know, many pl aces like that. We went to the house where my wife grew up. But that was just recently. When I was back in Germany, that was the city of Cologne and they invited people that were born in the Cologne area, there were 40 people, 20 from ger -- from U.S. and 20 from Israel. That was a very interesting experience, but I don\u2122t think it showed us much, that the Germans had changed that much. I know this, Friday night they took us to synagogue by bus and then we walked back to the hotel. And they had two men walking bus -- us, officially that we wouldn\u2122t get lost. I think it was for security reasons. They were -- in \u212287, I mean there\u2122s -- Germany is still you don\u2122t feel a hundred percent secure.
