First of all, as I may have put in my earlier interview, this is when my childhood essentially ended. I was 11 and a half and the German armies marched into Poland in 1939. By a curious coinci dent, although I don\u2122t believe there are coincidence in \u0152 in creation, last September one my mother died at the age of 94. Now \u0152"

            "answer": "Today is the anniversary, yes. My father came to the United States about 1943, he was an officer in the Polish army and participated in the effort to recruit volunteers during the war, prior to Pearl Harbor. But of course \u0152 and he was located with a mission in Windsor, Ontario, across the river from Detroit, but obviously with the advent of American Japanese war, the mission lost its purpose Interview with Wallace Witkowski September 1, 1998 5and liquidated its activities and most of the people returned to England and Europe. However, my father was offered a job in the war industry, he was a chemical engineer and they were highly sought at the time, so he was admitted to the United States cell. By the time the war ended, he was making all sorts of efforts to try to find whether we survived the war and where we a \u0152 where are we and obviously trying to bring us over. Us meaning my mother, my younger sister and myself. Th-The first and obvious step was to apply for passports and permission to leave the country. My mother received that from the government, who \u0152 which at the time was a purportedly government of national unity, but it was only a transitional period before the communists coul d solidify their grip on that country and on the government, and they gave permission to my mother to leave Poland and join her husband in the United States, but did not give a permission to the two children, ages at that time, what was it, 1948? I was 20, my sister was 18. So I determined to escape from Poland and through contacts, family contacts, underground connections, I managed to ge t on a Swedish coal freighter, which was leaving Polish port city of Gdynia and was going to Goteborg, Sweden. I guess the excitement of actually trying to escape and join my father was so overwhelming that I did not have any nostalgic or any reflective thoughts about leaving my native land. To me it was escape from a prison, which was becoming worse and worse. Interview with Wallace Witkowski September 1, 1998 6And I was going first so that my sister could follow me on what we thought naively would be a safe route. And of course, I ma naged, I succeeded, my sister didn\u2122t and was caught by the communists and briefly im prisoned. So, the feelings were not dramatic at all, except in terms of excitement and going to my father, whom I had not seen for 10 years. And I think I describe d in my previous interview, some of the feelings that I had when I was arriving in the United States and trying to locate my father. But that, pretty much, I think should answer your first question."

We did corrupt them a little bit with the ease of agricultural surplus commodities, availability. Using our standards applied to the island star \u0152 standards, most of these people were below the level of poverty, but they lived off of subsiste nce agriculture, and they didn\u2122t know how little they had until the Americans told them.

            "question": "Well, how were you trying t \u0152 previously to be more American?",
            "answer": "It\u2122s very hard to articulate, but any person born abroad, coming to America, tries very hard to become Americanized, at least it\u2122s a typical, let\u2122s say, pattern. I mean, there will be staunch individualists who will refuse to become American, they will Interview with Wallace Witkowski September 1, 1998 21be French or they will be German, or they will be this and that, for reasons of either because they think that their ethnic background or cultural background is superior to the American \u0152 many, many foreigners come to America with a rather superior feeling about their own culture. It\u2122s a defense mechanism of sort, I believe. Here, I was trying to absorb American values, American customs, American tradition. I wanted my children to be American, after a ll, they are my roots in this country. I simply wanted to be able to live in this society and function in this society the best I could. Returning from Micronesia made me aware that I don\u2122t have to prove to myself anything, or climb yet another mountain, or \u0152 for example, when I returned to Washington , I resumed my career at the Federal Trade Commission, and there I discovered that I really don\u2122t care about th e antitrust in which I was working at the time, that it dealt with economic and shifting issues. I spent two or three years battling a \u0152 a ca \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 fighting in a case in which the law was changed after \u0152 after a couple years and I felt the \u0152 like standing on a shifting sand. I realized also that I\u2122m not happy not dealing with people. So then I switched in my career to consumer protection, because the Fe deral Trade Commission has two main functions. The antitrust \u0152 enforcement of the antitrust laws, which it shares with the justice department, and the consumer prot ection fo \u0152 mission. And I felt much more comfortable in the consumer protection area. And in fact, I continued from a year or Interview with Wallace Witkowski September 1, 1998 22two after I returned from Micronesia until I retired in 1994 \u0152 four. So that was the rest of my career in the government. I \u0152 I was an enforcement attorney, and a senior attorney, thought of well, getting good reviews. But I realized that I came to Washington for three years and I stayed in the government 32 years. I was qualified to retire, and I was getting \u0152 I was ready to move on, and in the meantime, personal crises, my second marriage failed also. I started worrying about myself, who am I and what am I doing with my life and what\u2122s going on? And I started examining my life probably around the age of 50, not before. By that time I was a father of four. I was bravely putting them through school and supporting them and giving the older children educations. Th ank God the two younger ones came 20 years later, I was able to take a breather before the \u0152 the last two daughters went to college. But I gave all of them education, except that I was examining and beginning to question all the values in which I grew up. I was a churchgoer, I actively participated in a number of activities in the parishes to which I belonged to. But as many contemporaries will tell you, not all of my needs were satisfied. I went into therapy, first of all, because I really got scared when my second marriage failed and I felt unhappy and I felt alienated a nd I felt a failure. And so, started my spiritual journey with reading such semi-s piritual but still thought provoking books Interview with Wallace Witkowski September 1, 1998 23as memoirs of Carl Jung, \ufb01Memories, Dreams, Reflections,\ufb02 or even M \u0152 what\u2122s his name, ems \u0152 George Peck or Scott Peck?"

We call it senior moments, but I\u2122m sure you\u2122ve heard that na me before \u0152 that term before. Peck was an influence. A number of other things that I read were also very helpful in beginning to turn to \u0152 to what do I believe in and where am I going and what\u2122s happening. And in the meantime I also discovered in therapy, both i ndividual and group that a number of years may have passed since the war, but the experiences, the feelings, the emotional and psychic wounds remained from that period. Not only the fear that absolutely paralyzed many of us for a long period of time during the years of very brutal Nazi occupation, but also a feeling of total helplessness, that there was not much we could do about it. I spoke abou t the feeling of helplessness when I saw and heard that my friends from grade school were killed or murdered wa \u0152 together with their parents. I witnessed situations in which I stood there and couldn\u2122t do anything while some people were brutali zed by other people. I personally cowered when \u0152 when a man in a uniform with a gun in his hand told me to do things, and I had to obey him. Open up my briefcase, show him what I had. That was, by the Interview with Wallace Witkowski September 1, 1998 24way, a briefcase in which I carried music. I was, at that time trying to study piano a little bit, didn\u2122t last very long, but I wa s stopped by a German patrol and the same feeling of being absolutely helpless and viol ated. These things stay with us and the sense of injustice, a sense of outrage at the power being imposed on you against your will. So perhaps that explains why I chose to work for the government and maybe make less money than in private pr actice, because eventually in private practice I would have made a lot more money than \u0152 than working for the government, a rigid grade system and all that stuff, you just got so much money and that\u2122s it. Although I am not complaining, I was \u0152 I was a high grade and I have a nice, comfortable retirement, which is \u0152 totally satisfies me. Spiritually, I went through a sort of a \u0152 I don\u2122t know how to describe it, awakening. I searched for a system of beliefs that would more be res ponding to my instinctive need to correct something that is wrong, because at times I did not feel sinful, at times I did not feel guilty. Although by the presets of my church, I was a sinful, guilty lost soul and I had to really try very hard and sacrifice a lot before I would maybe gain salvation."

There were already at that time going on, translations into a number of other langua ges. And to make the long story short, through a process of submitting samples of translations and reviewing them and commenting on them, the Foundation for Inner Peace, which is a publisher of the course, chose a young man in Warsaw, young man from my point of view, relatively speaking, the man in his 40\u2122s, and \u0152 as a translator and me as an editor of his translation. We essentially were translating and making sure that the trans \u0152 the substance of each sentence, each paragraph and chapter is \u0152 is correctly rendered in Polish.

            "answer": "Yes, oh even when the first efforts at the museum \u0152 at the organiza \u0152 ororganizing the museum took pl ace, I was, as you can tell from the interview in 1990 \u0152 first of all, I donated a number of bo oks and pamphlets and materials to the museum, because when I was handling the American claims for property lost in Poland, when I was working for the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, and when I was stationed in Warsaw , I managed to reach the people, the survivors who Interview with Wallace Witkowski September 1, 1998 28are running the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw. And I obtained from them a number of unique publications , such as witness accounts of liquidation of ghetto of Sosnowiec or of some other \u0152 Bialystok, rather obscure publications, of which there weren\u2122t very many, you know, issues available. You couldn\u2122t find it in a library. But I brought all of these things with me. And when the museum opened, I thought I would donate all of these things to the museum and that\u2122s how my cooperation with the museum started. I turned over all of those things. There weren\u2122t very many, 10 - 20 books maybe, pa mphlets, but they are today in the library. And then I think you then come in and you have read my interview in 1990, so you know where I felt that I needed to testify as a witness to what I knew from a unique perspective of being this boy scout troop leader who had a boy in my troop who told me the story about his brother being lost and then militia taking him, communist militia taking him to the house in which the Jewish survivors lived and saying to the little boy, it \u0152 is \u0152 were you ke pt here? And the kid said yes. That\u2122s \u0152 that\u2122s the version that I received from my \u0152 from my member of my troop. So I felt duty bound to give testimony to the truth as I know it. So that\u2122s how the interview came about. And then I realized that I can be of help in the oral department. And I no longer remember \u0152 but I know that I submitted my offer to \u0152 to translate. That was lost somewhere and somebody \u0152 on somebody\u2122s desk for a year, then I \u0152 Interview with Wallace Witkowski September 1, 1998 29nothing was done about it. One day I enquir ed, aren\u2122t you interested in somebody who knows both languages and can translate? Yes, yes, submit an application. Well, okay. I don\u2122t know what happened to \u0152 finally I \u0152 I was put in touch with the oral history department and was as ked to help them in translating more significant key testimony of witnesses who were testifying in Polish. And over the last two, three years, I lose track of it because these were long translations, long projects. I worked on the Mordowicz translation, which is an incredible story of a man who twice escaped from Auschwitz and lived to tell. And another long and dramatic testimony of a woman who n \u0152 was one of the early inmates in Auschwitz-Birkenau, Ozhrenczim(ph) Druzhinikov (ph), and also lived \u0152 and what was particularly moving about it was the fact that she admits in the course of the interview that in crucial moments in her life in the camp, or after the camp, it was her Jewish girlfriends who saved her life. That was a very wrenching job to do. It was a type of work that I could work on, and then I had to go away from it for days sometimes, sometimes a couple weeks before I could return to it. It was just too devastating to relive with this person, what she had to say. I\u2122m delaying giving you the name because I \u0152 I have a mental br \u0152 block right now, and I cannot remember her name, but of course, Amy Rubin knows because these are la \u0152 my two primary claims to fame as a translator, a volunteer translator for the museum. Why, the most difficult Interview with Wallace Witkowski September 1, 1998 30question to answer. Because you see, more than 50 years may have passed since those years of Nazi occupation in Poland , but the events and the feelings stay with us and somehow I feel that this is my way of doing something, because then I was not able to do anything. And secondly, on a deeper level, it is my feeling that in some way I am engaged in some act of expiation or \u0152 or contrition on behalf of my countrymen, for things that they did, or failed to do when they could have. Now, I do not minimize the mutual accusations betw een the Christian Poles and the Jewish Poles against each other. Anti-Semitism certainly was and is alive, unfortunately, which is a curious phenomenon because there are no more Jews in Poland and yet, something in \u0152 something has caught both gr oups in \u0152 in \u0152 in this vicious circle. Now there is a controversy about Poles putting up Christian crosses in \u0152 in the place in which both Poles and Jews died, and Je wish tradition, of course, requires that nothing be done there [indecipherable] . And \u0152 and there are radicals in both groups that foment discord. So I \u0152 somehow I \u0152 I ju st feel that whatever I can do to just assist the museum in its mission, I\u2122ll do it. And even though I am now in the process of moving to Michigan and I will be spending most of my time in Michigan, I will be connected by modern technology with Washington, with the museum, and Amy Rubin knows that any time she needs something from me, she can do it just like she did here. Give me the video of the interview of a witness in Interview with Wallace Witkowski September 1, 1998 31Polish, give me a transcript, and I will sit down and I\u2122ll translate it and give it back to her, as long as I\u2122ll \u0152 my mind is still working."

I think \u0152 think that not only the mission of the museum, of teaching people that intolerance, prejudice, discrimination, all these ugly phenomena that characterize our life on earth, have to be eradicated, eliminated. But we have to, ever so slowly, try to awaken to the fact that we are all members of oneness, we are all children of God, we are all brothers, we are all oneness, and as long as we continue looking at other people as separate and distinct from a \u0152 from us, we \u0152 we are not going to find our way back to our creator. And I am a firm believer in that. And I, in this sense too, I see my work for the museum as \u0152 as possibly indirectly contributing. I am extremely impressed with the skill and enthusiasm and \u0152 and \u0152 and \u0152 and energy with which the museum was created, is being supported, is being developed and continues its work.
