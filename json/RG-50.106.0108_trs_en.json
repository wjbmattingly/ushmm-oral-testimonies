First of all, as I may have put in my earlier interview, this is when my childhood essentially ended. I was 11 and a half and the German armies marched into Poland in 1939. By a curious coincident, although I don\u2019t believe there are coincidence in \u2014 1n creation, last September one my mother died at the age of 94. Now \u2014"

            "answer": "Today is the anniversary, yes. My father came to the United States about 1943, he was an officer in the Polish army and participated in the effort to recruit volunteers during the war, prior to Pearl Harbor. But of course \u2014 and he was located with a mission in Windsor, Ontario, across the river from Detroit, but obviously with the advent of American Japanese war, the mission lost its purpose Interview with Wallace Witkowski \u00b0 September 1, 1998 and liquidated its activities and most of the people returned to England and Europe. However, my father was offered a job in the war industry, he was a chemical engineer and they were highly sought at the time, so he was admitted to the United States cell. By the time the war ended, he was making all sorts of efforts to try to find whether we survived the war and where we a \u2014 where are we and obviously trying to bring us over. Us meaning my mother, my younger sister and myself. Th-The first and obvious step was to apply for passports and permission to leave the country. My mother received that from the government, who \u2014 which at the time was a purportedly government of national unity, but it was only a transitional period before the communists could solidify their grip on that country and on the government, and they gave permission to my mother to leave Poland and join her husband in the United States, but did not give a permission to the two children, ages at that time, what was it, 1948? I was 20, my sister was 18. So I determined to escape from Poland and through contacts, family contacts, underground connections, I managed to get on a Swedish coal freighter, which was leaving Polish port city of Gdynia and was going to Goteborg, Sweden. I guess the excitement of actually trying to escape and join my father was so overwhelming that I did not have any nostalgic or any reflective thoughts about leaving my native land. To me it was escape from a prison, which was becoming worse and worse. Interview with Wallace Witkowski \u00b0 September 1, 1998 And I was going first so that my sister could follow me on what we thought naively would be a safe route. And of course, I managed, I succeeded, my sister didn\u2019t and was caught by the communists and briefly imprisoned. So, the feelings were not dramatic at all, except in terms of excitement and going to my father, whom I had not seen for 10 years. And I think I described in my previous interview, some of the feelings that I had when I was arriving in the United States and trying to locate my father. But that, pretty much, I think should answer your first question."

            "answer": "It\u2019s very hard to articulate, but any person born abroad, coming to America, tries very hard to become Americanized, at least it\u2019s a typical, let\u2019s say, pattern. I mean, there will be staunch individualists who will refuse to become American, they will Interview with Wallace Witkowski ot September 1, 1998 be French or they will be German, or they will be this and that, for reasons of either because they think that their ethnic background or cultural background is superior to the American \u2014 many, many foreigners come to America with a rather superior feeling about their own culture. It\u2019s a defense mechanism of sort, I believe. Here, I was trying to absorb American values, American customs, American tradition. I wanted my children to be American, after all, they are my roots in this country. I simply wanted to be able to live in this society and function in this society the best I could. Returning from Micronesia made me aware that I don\u2019t have to prove to myself anything, or climb yet another mountain, or \u2014 for example, when I returned to Washington, I resumed my career at the Federal Trade Commission, and there I discovered that I really don\u2019t care about the antitrust in which I was working at the time, that it dealt with economic and shifting issues. I spent two or three years battling a \u2014 a ca \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 fighting in a case in which the law was changed after \u2014 after a couple years and I felt the \u2014 like standing on a shifting sand. I realized also that I\u2019m not happy not dealing with people. So then I switched in my career to consumer protection, because the Federal Trade Commission has two main functions. The antitrust \u2014 enforcement of the antitrust laws, which it shares with the justice department, and the consumer protection fo \u2014 mission. And I felt much more comfortable in the consumer protection area. And in fact, I continued from a year or Interview with Wallace Witkowski \u201c September 1, 1998 two after I returned from Micronesia until I retired in 1994 \u2014 four. So that was the rest of my career in the government. I \u2014 I was an enforcement attorney, and a senior attorney, thought of well, getting good reviews. But I realized that I came to Washington for three years and I stayed in the government 32 years. I was qualified to retire, and I was getting \u2014 I was ready to move on, and in the meantime, personal crises, my second marriage failed also. I started worrying about myself, who am I and what am I doing with my life and what\u2019s going on? And I started examining my life probably around the age of 50, not before. By that time I was a father of four. I was bravely putting them through school and supporting them and giving the older children educations. Thank God the two younger ones came 20 years later, I was able to take a breather before the \u2014 the last two daughters went to college. But I gave all of them education, except that I was examining and beginning to question all the values in which I grew up. I was a churchgoer, I actively participated in a number of activities in the parishes to which I belonged to. But as many contemporaries will tell you, not all of my needs were satisfied. I went into therapy, first of all, because I really got scared when my second marriage failed and I felt unhappy and I felt alienated and I felt a failure. And so, started my spiritual journey with reading such semi-spiritual but still thought provoking books Interview with Wallace Witkowski oS September 1, 1998 as memoirs of Carl Jung, \u201cMemories, Dreams, Reflections,\u201d or even M \u2014 what\u2019s his name, ems \u2014 George Peck or Scott Peck?"

We call it senior moments, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard that name before \u2014 that term before. Peck was an influence. A number of other things that I read were also very helpful in beginning to turn to \u2014 to what do I believe in and where am I going and what\u2019s happening. And in the meantime I also discovered in therapy, both individual and group that a number of years may have passed since the war, but the experiences, the feelings, the emotional and psychic wounds remained from that period. Not only the fear that absolutely paralyzed many of us for a long period of time during the years of very brutal Nazi occupation, but also a feeling of total helplessness, that there was not much we could do about it. I spoke about the feeling of helplessness when I saw and heard that my friends from grade school were killed or murdered wa \u2014 together with their parents. I witnessed situations in which I stood there and couldn\u2019t do anything while some people were brutalized by other people. I personally cowered when \u2014 when a man in a uniform with a gun in his hand told me to do things, and I had to obey him. Open up my briefcase, show him what I had. That was, by the Interview with Wallace Witkowski a\u201c September 1, 1998 way, a briefcase in which I carried music. I was, at that time trying to study piano a little bit, didn\u2019t last very long, but I was stopped by a German patrol and the same feeling of being absolutely helpless and violated. These things stay with us and the sense of injustice, a sense of outrage at the power being imposed on you against your will. So perhaps that explains why I chose to work for the government and maybe make less money than in private practice, because eventually in private practice I would have made a lot more money than \u2014 than working for the government, a rigid grade system and all that stuff, you just got so much money and that\u2019s it. Although I am not complaining, I was \u2014 I was a high grade and I have a nice, comfortable retirement, which is \u2014 totally satisfies me. Spiritually, I went through a sort of a \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to describe it, awakening. I searched for a system of beliefs that would more be responding to my instinctive need to correct something that is wrong, because at times I did not feel sinful, at times I did not feel guilty. Although by the presets of my church, I was a sinful, guilty lost soul and I had to really try very hard and sacrifice a lot before I would maybe gain salvation."

There were already at that time going on, translations into a number of other languages. And to make the long story short, through a process of submitting samples of translations and reviewing them and commenting on them, the Foundation for Inner Peace, which 1s a publisher of the course, chose a young man in Warsaw, young man from my point of view, relatively speaking, the man in his 40\u2019s, and \u2014 as a translator and me as an editor of his translation.

            "answer": "Yes, oh even when the first efforts at the museum \u2014 at the organiza \u2014 or- organizing the museum took place, I was, as you can tell from the interview in 1990 \u2014 first of all, I donated a number of books and pamphlets and materials to the museum, because when I was handling the American claims for property lost in Poland, when I was working for the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, and when I was stationed in Warsaw, I managed to reach the people, the survivors who Interview with Wallace Witkowski \u201c September 1, 1998 are running the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw. And I obtained from them a number of unique publications, such as witness accounts of liquidation of ghetto of Sosnowiec or of some other \u2014 Bialystok, rather obscure publications, of which there weren\u2019t very many, you know, issues available. You couldn\u2019t find it in a library. But I brought all of these things with me. And when the museum opened, I thought I would donate all of these things to the museum and that\u2019s how my cooperation with the museum started. I turned over all of those things. There weren\u2019t very many, 10 - 20 books maybe, pamphlets, but they are today in the library. And then I think you then come in and you have read my interview in 1990, so you know where I felt that I needed to testify as a witness to what I knew from a unique perspective of being this boy scout troop leader who had a boy in my troop who told me the story about his brother being lost and then militia taking him, communist militia taking him to the house in which the Jewish survivors lived and saying to the little boy, 1t \u2014 is \u2014 were you kept here? And the kid said yes. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the version that I received from my \u2014 from my member of my troop. So I felt duty bound to give testimony to the truth as I know it. So that\u2019s how the interview came about. And then I realized that I can be of help in the oral department. And I no longer remember \u2014 but I know that I submitted my offer to \u2014 to translate. That was lost somewhere and somebody \u2014 on somebody\u2019s desk for a year, then I \u2014 Interview with Wallace Witkowski \u201d September 1, 1998 nothing was done about it. One day I enquired, aren\u2019t you interested in somebody who knows both languages and can translate? Yes, yes, submit an application. Well, okay. I don\u2019t know what happened to \u2014 finally I \u2014 I was put in touch with the oral history department and was asked to help them in translating more significant key testimony of witnesses who were testifying in Polish. And over the last two, three years, I lose track of it because these were long translations, long projects. I worked on the Mordowicz translation, which is an incredible story of a man who twice escaped from Auschwitz and lived to tell. And another long and dramatic testimony of a woman who n \u2014 was one of the early inmates in Auschwitz-Birkenau, Ozhrenczim(ph) Druzhinikov(ph), and also lived \u2014 and what was particularly moving about it was the fact that she admits in the course of the interview that in crucial moments in her life in the camp, or after the camp, it was her Jewish girlfriends who saved her life. That was a very wrenching job to do. It was a type of work that I could work on, and then I had to go away from it for days sometimes, sometimes a couple weeks before I could return to it. It was just too devastating to relive with this person, what she had to say. I\u2019m delaying giving you the name because I \u2014 I have a mental br \u2014 block right now, and I cannot remember her name, but of course, Amy Rubin knows because these are la \u2014 my two primary claims to fame as a translator, a volunteer translator for the museum. Why, the most difficult Interview with Wallace Witkowski * September 1, 1998 question to answer. Because you see, more than 50 years may have passed since those years of Nazi occupation in Poland, but the events and the feelings stay with us and somehow I feel that this is my way of doing something, because then I was not able to do anything. And secondly, on a deeper level, it is my feeling that in some way I am engaged in some act of expiation or \u2014 or contrition on behalf of my countrymen, for things that they did, or failed to do when they could have. Now, I do not minimize the mutual accusations between the Christian Poles and the Jewish Poles against each other. Anti-Semitism certainly was and is alive, unfortunately, which is a curious phenomenon because there are no more Jews in Poland and yet, something in \u2014 something has caught both groups in \u2014 in \u2014 in this vicious circle. Now there is a controversy about Poles putting up Christian crosses in \u2014 in the place in which both Poles and Jews died, and Jewish tradition, of course, requires that nothing be done there [indecipherable]. And \u2014 and there are radicals in both groups that foment discord. So I \u2014 somehow I \u2014 I just feel that whatever I can do to just assist the museum in its mission, I\u2019Il do it. And even though I am now in the process of moving to Michigan and I will be spending most of my time in Michigan, I will be connected by modern technology with Washington, with the museum, and Amy Rubin knows that any time she needs something from me, she can do it just like she did here. Give me the video of the interview of a witness in Interview with Wallace Witkowski * September 1, 1998 Polish, give me a transcript, and I will sit down and I'll translate it and give it back to her, as long as \u2019'll \u2014 my mind 1s still working."

I think \u2014 think that not only the mission of the museum, of teaching people that intolerance, prejudice, discrimination, all these ugly phenomena that characterize our life on earth, have to be eradicated, eliminated. But we have to, ever so slowly, try to awaken to the fact that we are all members of oneness, we are all children of God, we are all brothers, we are all oneness, and as long as we continue looking at other people as separate and distinct from a \u2014 from us, we \u2014 we are not going to find our way back to our creator. And I am a firm believer in that. And I, in this sense too, I see my work for the museum as \u2014 as possibly indirectly contributing. I am extremely impressed with the skill and enthusiasm and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and energy with which the museum was created, is being supported, is being developed and continues its work. And I want to be a part of it, but I also want to be a part of the general effort to teach all of us, and the museum is doing its share, showing other, equally egregious holoca \u2014 Holocaust-like experiences of other ethnic groups, be Interview with Wallace Witkowski * September 1, 1998 they Armenians or \u2014 or just because some county is in Asia, that should not matter less than a mil \u2014 million people were killed because they were Asian rather than they were other group, religious or ethnic.
