This 1s a follow up interview that will focus on Mr. Witkowski\u2019s post Holocaust experiences. In preparation for this interview, I read a transcript of the interview you conducted with the museum on September 13, 1990. I will not ask you to repeat everything that you said in that interview, instead, I will use this interview as an opportunity to follow up on that interview and focus on your post- Holocaust experiences.

First of all, as I may have put in my earlier interview, this is when my childhood essentially ended. I was 11 and a half and the German armies marched into Poland in 1939. By a curious coincident, although I don\u2019t believe there are coincidence in \u2014 1n creation, last September one my mother died at the age of 94. Now \u2014"

My father came to the United States about 1943, he was an officer in the Polish army and participated in the effort to recruit volunteers during the war, prior to Pearl Harbor. But of course \u2014 and he was located with a mission in Windsor, Ontario, across the river from Detroit, but obviously with the advent of American Japanese war, the mission lost its purpose This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

However, my father was offered a job in the war industry, he was a chemical engineer and they were highly sought at the time, so he was admitted to the United States cell. By the time the war ended, he was making all sorts of efforts to try to find whether we survived the war and where we a \u2014 where are we and obviously trying to bring us over. Us meaning my mother, my younger sister and myself. Th-The first and obvious step was to apply for passports and permission to leave the country. My mother received that from the government, who \u2014 which at the time was a purportedly government of national unity, but it was only a transitional period before the communists could solidify their grip on that country and on the government, and they gave permission to my mother to leave Poland and join her husband in the United States, but did not give a permission to the two children, ages at that time, what was it, 1948? I was 20, my sister was 18. So I determined to escape from Poland and through contacts, family contacts, underground connections, I managed to get on a Swedish coal freighter, which was leaving Polish port city of Gdynia and was going to Goteborg, Sweden. I guess the excitement of actually trying to escape and join my father was so overwhelming that I did not have any nostalgic or any reflective thoughts about leaving my native land. To me it was escape from a prison, which was becoming worse and worse. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.  http://collections.ushmm.org  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wallace Witkowski \u00b0 September 1, 1998 And I was going first so that my sister could follow me on what we thought naively would be a safe route. And of course, I managed, I succeeded, my sister didn\u2019t and was caught by the communists and briefly imprisoned. So, the feelings were not dramatic at all, except in terms of excitement and going to my father, whom I had not seen for 10 years. And I think I described in my previous interview, some of the feelings that I had when I was arriving in the United States and trying to locate my father. But that, pretty much, I think should answer your first question."

Returning from Micronesia made me aware that I don\u2019t have to prove to myself anything, or climb yet another mountain, or \u2014 for example, when I returned to Washington, I resumed my career at the Federal Trade Commission, and there I discovered that I really don\u2019t care about the antitrust in which I was working at the time, that it dealt with economic and shifting issues.

Thank God the two younger ones came 20 years later, I was able to take a breather before the \u2014 the last two daughters went to college. But I gave all of them education, except that I was examining and beginning to question all the values in which I grew up. I was a churchgoer, I actively participated in a number of activities in the parishes to which I belonged to. But as many contemporaries will tell you, not all of my needs were satisfied.

We call it senior moments, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard that name before \u2014 that term before. Peck was an influence. A number of other things that I read were also very helpful in beginning to turn to \u2014 to what do I believe in and where am I going and what\u2019s happening. And in the meantime I also discovered in therapy, both individual and group that a number of years may have passed since the war, but the experiences, the feelings, the emotional and psychic wounds remained from that period. Not only the fear that absolutely paralyzed many of us for a long period of time during the years of very brutal Nazi occupation, but also a feeling of total helplessness, that there was not much we could do about it. I spoke about the feeling of helplessness when I saw and heard that my friends from grade school were killed or murdered wa \u2014 together with their parents. I witnessed situations in which I stood there and couldn\u2019t do anything while some people were brutalized by other people.

I was, at that time trying to study piano a little bit, didn\u2019t last very long, but I was stopped by a German patrol and the same feeling of being absolutely helpless and violated. These things stay with us and the sense of injustice, a sense of outrage at the power being imposed on you against your will. So perhaps that explains why I chose to work for the government and maybe make less money than in private practice, because eventually in private practice I would have made a lot more money than \u2014 than working for the government, a rigid grade system and all that stuff, you just got so much money and that\u2019s it. Although I am not complaining, I was \u2014 I was a high grade and I have a nice, comfortable retirement, which is \u2014 totally satisfies me. Spiritually, I went through a sort of a \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to describe it, awakening. I searched for a system of beliefs that would more be responding to my instinctive need to correct something that is wrong, because at times I did not feel sinful, at times I did not feel guilty. Although by the presets of my church, I was a sinful, guilty lost soul and I had to really try very hard and sacrifice a lot before I would maybe gain salvation."

And \u2014 and there are radicals in both groups that foment discord. So I \u2014 somehow I \u2014 I just feel that whatever I can do to just assist the museum in its mission, I\u2019Il do it. And even though I am now in the process of moving to Michigan and I will be spending most of my time in Michigan, I will be connected by modern technology with Washington, with the museum, and Amy Rubin knows that any time she needs something from me, she can do it just like she did here.

            "answer": "Well, it\u2019s been asked of me a \u2014 a number of times previously, including some video interviews. This ties in very deeply with my spiritual values. I think \u2014 think that not only the mission of the museum, of teaching people that intolerance, prejudice, discrimination, all these ugly phenomena that characterize our life on earth, have to be eradicated, eliminated. But we have to, ever so slowly, try to awaken to the fact that we are all members of oneness, we are all children of God, we are all brothers, we are all oneness, and as long as we continue looking at other people as separate and distinct from a \u2014 from us, we \u2014 we are not going to find our way back to our creator. And I am a firm believer in that. And I, in this sense too, I see my work for the museum as \u2014 as possibly indirectly contributing. I am extremely impressed with the skill and enthusiasm and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and energy with which the museum was created, is being supported, is being developed and continues its work. And I want to be a part of it, but I also want to be a part of the general effort to teach all of us, and the museum is doing its share, showing other, equally egregious holoca \u2014 Holocaust-like experiences of other ethnic groups, be This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So I guess this is the best I can articulate at this point, why I committed to \u2014 to \u2014 to work for the museum."

But I think the \u2014 that \u2014 that I volunteer for a slightly different reason than let\u2019s say a \u2014a typical, if I may use that word, survivor volunteer works for the museum. There is a deep, tragic, desperate effort to make sure that the people who died, didn\u2019t die in vain, without any \u2014 any lessons to be learned from it. So I can \u2014 I respect my \u2014 I \u2014- I\u2014 I \u2014 I am 1n awe of these people who come and travel a long distance sometimes, to spend a couple hours in the museum, just being escorts, or \u2014 or guides. My commitment is the same and yet somewhat different, because even though all the men in my family died as a result of the war, except my father, who survived the war, but I had uncles. One, a pilot who died in England, another persecuted and \u2014 and killed by the communists, I feel that I have the need to assist in preserving the story of the Holocaust and teaching. In one of the interviews I said six million or seven million died, and they\u2019re silenced, so This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.
