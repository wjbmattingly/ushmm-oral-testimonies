The one thing they didn\u2019t want is any kind of -- I don\u2019t want to call it an uprising, but they didn\u2019t want any trouble. And by taking the German ga -- the Germans developed a system where they took one part of a group of Jews. They didn\u2019t just arrest Jews, it was always a group of Jews, it was first the German Jews, then the male -- male Jews between the ages of 16 and 21, then another little group, then another little group. There was always a group, so that everybody else still felt, \u201cOh my God, thank goodness they didn\u2019t take me.\u201d And this was the German mode of operation, one group at a time. Then they took people who were not married. It was young people if not married, then young people to a certain age, who were married. You know, it was always a group of people."

We\u2019re taking about the year 1942, my father, my mother and I went to a farmhouse, in the southern part of Holland, a province of Limberg, and there was a problem there, there was another family that came, a Mr. and Mrs. Kahn, and Mrs. Kahn was a very attractive young lady. Her husband was an accountant, and he looked -- I don\u2019t know how those two ever got married, he was the opposite from her, and she started an affair with the farmer, very -- wit -- I mean, a very silly thing to do, in -- under the circumstances, and the wife of the farmer found out about it, and she -- they had children, and in her despair, and I can\u2019t blame her, she went to the Gestapo and told them what the problem was, and so one day, while we were all sitting for ouch -- we were sitting down at dinner time, I look -- we looked out the window, and there were four or five Gestapo agents driving up and coming -- you know, running into the building. And Mr. Kahn -- Mrs. Kahn went out the back door. My father went up -- went up in the attic, and my mother went into the bedroom and I went into a bathroom. I mean, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not a bathroom as we know it in America, it\u2019s you know, it\u2019s just a toilet, and there was a little ledge, and I was hiding behind the ledge. And they arrested my father, and they arrested Mr. Kahn, and my mother and I, we -- it\u2019s a long story, really, but she was hiding in a closet, and they -- they opened up every closet in the house and finally they -- to make a very long story short, there\u2019s much more to it, but during the night, I put up a ladder against the house and ma -- got my mother out of the window, and then we went into a haystack, and then after that, there was a young girl -- this was way past midnight -- a young girl of the Dutch -- of the Dutch underground, sh-she probably was no more than 16 or 17 years old, came on a bicycle to tell us that the -- th-the Germans were aware that they were -- that they had missed two more Jews, that\u2019s my mother and I, and Mrs. Kahn for that matter, and so they were on their way back.

I -- I don\u2019t think I can describe it, there is no way that I can describe the feeling. And as we got closer to this Canadian soldier, I happened to see -- so I -- I went over there, and wanted to shake hands with him, when I saw a -- on his sleeve, the word Jewish brigade, with the Jewish star.

And -- And then, we -- we had to look for a place to live. Now, we still- we had a little money, which we didn\u2019t have on us, but there was a -- one of our neighbors, a very lovely, elderly lady, she had some of our money, that we gave her the day then when we left our apartment in Amsterdam, in 1941.

And I took the newspaper and I went into Central Park, and I want to sit on a bench, and first of all, I was absolutely amazed, I couldn\u2019t believe it, the New York Times came in -- in four, five, six sections. When I left Holland, in those days, right after the war, the newspaper was one page. That was the newspaper. And here I come to New York, and -- and I mean it was two inches thick. And so I took it into Central Park, sat down on a bench, and it took me -- it took me 20 minutes just to find out in what section of the New York Times, do I find the wanted ads, the employment ads. And -- And finally I -- I did find it. Now, of course, I spoke very, very little English, just a year or two what I had learned in school. And -- And I tried to read it, and I couldn\u2019t find it because -- or I couldn\u2019t read it because everything was abbreviated. APRX, now what does that stand for? Approximately? I mean, you know, I had no idea. And so I said to myself, let me go to the next bench, there was a man sitting there, and I went over there, and I asked him, I said, \u201cI wonder whether you can help me?\u201d And what do you think he said? He says, \u201cI not speak English.\u201d So -- So I was more or less forced to do it on my own, and I saw an ad by Gimbel\u2019s on 34\" Street, they are no longer there today, but in those days Gimbel\u2019s was down on 34\" Street. I went there, went to the employment office, and there was a -- a real New York woman, a | -- I was going to say a lady, but to me she was not a lady, she was a woman who said, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m looking for a job.\u201d \u201cWell, we have -- we\u2019re looking for ri,\u201d -- this was just before Christmas, they were looking for Christmas help. \u201cWe have a -- We have -- We\u2019re looking for wrappers.\u201d I said, \u201cOh good, that\u2019s what I always wanted to be, a wrapper.\u201d I wanted to be a wrapper in -- in America. So I got a job. So they took me and put me in the -- 1n the toy department, and I\u2019m wrapping toys like crazy, and all of a sudden, there is a hu -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m handling a huge doll, which was made out of porcelain. In those days, plastic wasn\u2019t that popular. And I dropped it on the floor in 5,000,000 pieces and the supervisor -- su- supervisor was coming -- running over, and he says, \u201cYou can\u2019t work here. Go up to the 11\" floor, the rug department.\u201d So I was in the rug department, wrapping rugs."

That the existence of the Jewish people is tied to Jewish sovereignty, and a Jewish army that rests on the strength of Jewish faith.\u201d And I wanted to ask Mr. von Halle\u2019s opinion about this.",

As a Holocaust survivor, and I\u2019m quo -- I -- I talked about it ear -- early on, that when we were in Europe, we were alone. There was nobody to help us. Mr. Roosevelt didn\u2019t think it was necessary, or prudent, or whatever reason he had, to help the people in the concentration camps directly. By that I mean he didn\u2019t feel he should -- he could, or he should or what -- for whatever other reason, bomb the railroads tracks, bomb the gas chambers, and -- and etcetera. Now Mr. Netanyanu, what he is saying 1s, the Jewish people, by necessity can only -- should only rely on their own strength. I\u2019ve been asked many times the question, can what has happened in Europe, can it happen in the United States, and my answer has been, \u201cUnder the right circumstances. Under the right circumstances, it could happen here, too.\u201d What do I mean by that? If -- It all has to do with economics. If the economic situation in the United States gets so bad that people are desperate, people always look for a scapegoat, and the scapegoat, easily, are the Jewish people. Have been al -- through the centuries. And therefore, when Israel was made into -- into existence, I felt very, very good. Why did I feel good? There is now one country that you know has your interests at heart 100 percent. And if the situation ever came where you would have to leave the country, there is one country that will accept you, and defend you. And how do they defend you? By armed might, if -- if need be. Don\u2019t forget, let me talk about, my wife came to the United States, on the steamship Saint Louis, not the last one, the one before the last one. The last one, there were several hundred German Jews, left Germany after Hitler was in power already, trying to get to Cuba, had Cuba visas. At the last moment they -- Cuban government refused entry. Then they went to Miami. We\u2019re talking again about Mr. Roosevelt. I\u2019m -- I -- As -- By now, I guess you know, I\u2019m not a great friend of Mr. Roosevelt. Mr. Roosevelt didn\u2019t feel 1t was necessary, or for political reasons, to admit those, whatever were, three - 400 German Jews, and sent them back to Europe. Now, if the -- if this -- if -- if there had been an Israel, these -- this ship could easily have gone to Israel, and these Jews would have been saved. So, when you ask me a question about what Mr. Netanyanu said -- and I\u2019m not a friend, incidentally, of Mr. Netanyanu, I don\u2019t think -- I think Mr. Rabin was a much better Prime Minister, but I agree with -- with the quote, yes.
