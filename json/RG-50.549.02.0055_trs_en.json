            "answer": "At that time the Germans had a system. They felt if they could get first rid of German Jews, that wouldn\u2019t disturb the Dutch Jews too much. The one thing they didn\u2019t want is any kind of -- I don\u2019t want to call it an uprising, but they didn\u2019t want any trouble. And by taking the German ga -- the Germans developed a system where they took one part of a group of Jews. They didn\u2019t just arrest Jews, it was always a group of Jews, it was first the German Jews, then the male -- male Jews between the ages of 16 and 21, then another little group, then another little group. There was always a group, so that everybody else still felt, \u201cOh my God, thank goodness they didn\u2019t take me.\u201d And this was the German mode of operation, one group at a time. Then they took people who were not married. It was young people if not married, then young people to a certain age, who were married. You know, it was always a group of people.

So, I remembered the New York Times, and I walked down from wherever it was, 67\" Street, on Central Park West, I walked down Central Park West to 59\" Street, and there was, and still is to -- to this very day, a kiosk, a -- a -- a newsstand.

When I left Holland, in those days, right after the war, the newspaper was one page. That was the newspaper. And here I come to New York, and -- and I mean it was two inches thick. And so I took it into Central Park, sat down on a bench, and it took me -- it took me 20 minutes just to find out in what section of the New York Times, do I find the wanted ads, the employment ads.

I went there, went to the employment office, and there was a -- a real New York woman, a | -- I was going to say a lady, but to me she was not a lady, she was a woman who said, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m looking for a job.\u201d \u201cWell, we have -- we\u2019re looking for ri,\u201d -- this was just before Christmas, they were looking for Christmas help. \u201cWe have a -- We have -- We\u2019re looking for wrappers.\u201d I said, \u201cOh good, that\u2019s what I always wanted to be, a wrapper.\u201d I wanted to be a wrapper in -- in America.

            "question": "Now I\u2019m -- I\u2019m relating to an article that you\u2019ve just looked at in \u201cNation and World,\u201d that was there April 24\", 1998, and it\u2019s a statement that Netanyahu made about the Holocaust, saying, \u201cThis is the lesson of the Holocaust, this and only this. That the existence of the Jewish people is tied to Jewish sovereignty, and a Jewish army that rests on the strength of Jewish faith.\u201d And I wanted to ask Mr. von Halle\u2019s opinion about this.",
            "answer": "Well, you must remember, we\u2019re t -- he\u2019s -- he\u2019s being quoted in conjunction with the Holocaust. As a Holocaust survivor, and I\u2019m quo -- I -- I talked about it ear -- early on, that when we were in Europe, we were alone. There was nobody to help us. Mr. Roosevelt didn\u2019t think it was necessary, or prudent, or whatever reason he had, to help the people in the concentration camps directly. By that I mean he didn\u2019t feel he should -- he could, or he should or what -- for whatever other reason, bomb the railroads tracks, bomb the gas chambers, and -- and etcetera. Now Mr. Netanyanu, what he is saying 1s, the Jewish people, by necessity can only -- should only rely on their own strength. I\u2019ve been asked many times the question, can what has happened in Europe, can it happen in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection the United States, and my answer has been, \u201cUnder the right circumstances. Under the right circumstances, it could happen here, too.\u201d What do I mean by that? If -- It all has to do with economics. If the economic situation in the United States gets so bad that people are desperate, people always look for a scapegoat, and the scapegoat, easily, are the Jewish people. Have been al -- through the centuries. And therefore, when Israel was made into -- into existence, I felt very, very good. Why did I feel good? There is now one country that you know has your interests at heart 100 percent. And if the situation ever came where you would have to leave the country, there is one country that will accept you, and defend you. And how do they defend you? By armed might, if -- if need be. Don\u2019t forget, let me talk about, my wife came to the United States, on the steamship Saint Louis, not the last one, the one before the last one. The last one, there were several hundred German Jews, left Germany after Hitler was in power already, trying to get to Cuba, had Cuba visas. At the last moment they -- Cuban government refused entry. Then they went to Miami. We\u2019re talking again about Mr. Roosevelt. I\u2019m -- I -- As -- By now, I guess you know, I\u2019m not a great friend of Mr. Roosevelt. Mr. Roosevelt didn\u2019t feel 1t was necessary, or for political reasons, to admit those, whatever were, three - 400 German Jews, and sent them back to Europe. Now, if the -- if this -- if -- if there had been an Israel, these -- this ship could easily have gone to Israel, and these Jews would have been saved. So, when you ask me a question about what Mr. Netanyanu said -- and I\u2019m not a friend, incidentally, of Mr. Netanyanu, I don\u2019t think -- I think Mr. Rabin was a much This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.
