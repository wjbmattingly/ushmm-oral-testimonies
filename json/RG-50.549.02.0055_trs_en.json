The one thing they didn\u2122t want is any kind of -- I don\u2122t want to call it an uprisi ng, but they didn\u2122t want any trouble. And by taking the German ga -- the Germans developed a system where they took one part of a group of Jews. They didn\u2122t just arrest Jews, it was always a group of Jews, it was first the German Jews, then the male -- male Jews between the ages of 16 and 21, then another little group, then another little group. There was always a group, so that everybody else still felt, \ufb01Oh my God, thank goodness they didn\u2122t take me.\ufb02 And this was the German mode of operation, one group at a time. Then they took people who were not married. It was young people if not marri ed, then young people to a certain age, who were married. You know, it was always a group of people.

So, here I arrived in the -- in Rabbi Weiss\u2122s refugee center, and now I was told, before I came to hol -- before I came to America, that the thing you have to do, if you want to get a job USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0055 26 in America, you have to buy the New York Time s. And, so I arrived, I had five dollars in my pocket, and I arrived at that refugee center , went to sleep the -- that night, woke up the next morning, and now I needed a j ob, and I needed a job in a hurry. So, I remembered the New York Times, and I walked down from wherever it was, 67th Street, on Central Park West, I walked down Central Park West to 59th Street, and there was, and still is to -- to this very day, a kiosk, a -- a -- a newsstand. It\u2122s still there. And I went to ask the man for the New York t -- oh, I saw the New York Times lying there, and it was a nickel. So I put down a nickel, and now I was down to four dollars and 95 cents. And I took the newspaper and I went into Central Park , and I want to sit on a bench, and first of all, I was absolutely amazed, I couldn\u2122t believe it, the New York Times came in -- in four, five, six sections. When I left Holland, in those days, right after the war, the newspaper was one page. That was the newspa per. And here I come to New York, and -- and I mean it was two inches thick. And so I took it into Central Park, sat down on a bench, and it took me -- it took me 20 minutes just to find out in what section of the New York Times, do I find the wanted ads, the em ployment ads. And -- And finally I -- I did find it. Now, of course, I spoke very, very little English, just a year or two what I had learned in school. And -- And I tried to read it, and I couldn\u2122t find it because -- or I couldn\u2122t read it because everything was abbreviated. APRX, now what does that stand for? Approximately? I mean, you know, I had no idea. And so I said to myself, let me go to the next bench, there was a man sitting there, and I went over there, and I asked him, I said, \ufb01I wonder whether you can help me?\ufb02 An d what do you think he said? He says, \ufb01I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0055 27 not speak English.\ufb02 So -- So I was more or le ss forced to do it on my own, and I saw an ad by Gimbel\u2122s on 34th Street, they are no longer there today, but in those days Gimbel\u2122s was down on 34th Street. I went there, went to the employment office, and there was a -- a real New York woman, a l -- I was going to sa y a lady, but to me she was not a lady, she was a woman who said, \ufb01What do you want?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Well, I\u2122m looking for a job.\ufb02 \ufb01Well, we have -- we\u2122re looking for ri,\ufb02 -- this was just before Christmas, they were looking for Christmas help. \ufb01W e have a -- We have -- We\u2122re looking for wrappers.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Oh good, that\u2122s what I always wanted to be, a wrapper.\ufb02 I wa nted to be a wrapper in -- in America. So I got a job. So they took me and put me in the -- in the toy department, and I\u2122m wrapping toys like crazy, and all of a sudden, there is a hu -- I\u2122m -- I\u2122m handling a huge doll, which was made out of porcelain. In those days, plastic wasn\u2122t that popular. And I dropped it on the floor in 5,000,000 pieces and the supervisor -- susupervisor was coming -- running over, and he says, \ufb01You can\u2122t work here. Go up to the 11th floor, the rug department.\ufb02 So I was in the rug department, wrapping rugs."

As a Holocaust surv ivor, and I\u2122m quo -- I -- I talked about it ear -- early on, that when we were in Europe, we were alone. There was nobody to help us. Mr. Roosevelt didn\u2122t think it was necessary, or prudent, or whatever reason he had, to help the people in the concentration camps directly.

I\u2122ve been asked many times the question, can what has happened in Europe, can it happen in USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0055 58 the United States, and my answer has been, \ufb01Under the right circumstances. Under the right circumstances, it could happen here, too. \ufb02 What do I mean by that? If -- It all has to do with economics. If the economi c situation in the United States gets so bad that people are desperate, people always look for a scapegoat, and the scapegoat, easily, are the Jewish people.

There is now one country that you know has your interests at heart 100 percent. And if the situation ever came where you would have to leave the country, there is one country that will accept you, and defend you. An d how do they defend you? By ar med might, if -- if need be. Don\u2122t forget, let me talk about, my wife came to the United States, on the steamship Saint Louis, not the last one, the one before the last one. The last one, there were several hundred German Jews, left Germany after Hitler was in power already, trying to get to Cuba, had Cuba visas. At the last moment th ey -- Cuban government refused entry. Then they went to Miami. We\u2122re talking again about Mr. Roosevelt.

Mr. Roosevelt didn\u2122t feel it was necessary, or for political reasons, to admit those, whatever were, three - 400 German Jews, and sent them back to Europe. Now, if the -- if this -- if -- if there had been an Israel, these -- this ship could easily have gone to Israel, and these Jews would have been saved. So, when you ask me a question about what Mr. Netanyanu said -- and I\u2122m not a friend, incidentally, of Mr. Netanyanu, I don\u2122t think -- I think Mr. Rabin was a much USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0055 59 better Prime Minister, but I agree with -- with the quote, yes.
