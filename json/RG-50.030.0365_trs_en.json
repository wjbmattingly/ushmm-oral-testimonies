            "question": "Can you tell us your name and the name that you were born with, because I know it is different than your name now, and when you were born and where?",
            "answer": "I was born September 17, 1916, in Hannover, Germany. My name at that time was Bernard Fuchs, and I was born and raised in Hannover; and until 1936, I went through the schools and read the Nuremberg law, and it became too hard for us. I had to leave the university because no Jews could study further."

            "question": "Let's go back a little bit. Tell me about your family -- about your mother and your father and sister.",
            "answer": "My father and mother both came from L\u00e9dz. They had left Poland around when the war broke out, 1914 -- no before that -- 1913, they went to Elsass-Lothringen, which is part of France now and was at that time also. And there they lived until 1915 when they went to live in Germany. Father was a custom tailor, and he built up his own studio and built up a wonderful clientele. He was really the number-one custom tailor in Hannover. And my mother, may she rest in peace, died very young. She died already 1928, when I was 12 years old and is buried in Hannover. My father remarried in 1932 and had another son in 1933 and -- when I had to leave the university, I went on hash'alah\u2019 to be processed to go at that time Palestine. But my father got sick. He had a very serious operation, and he asked me to stay back and take care of his wife and son. So, this way, that is why I did not go to Palestine at that time. Then in 1938, there was a big Aktion\u2019 by the Germans where they took all foreigners, that means stateless or not, of German nationality -- Jews- and collected them all in a concert hall in Hannover, and -- where we stayed for a day and a night. And then they took us in cattle trains to the Polish border."

            "answer": "No, I left home. And -- I could not stay at that time. I just couldn't live with her. It became impossible. So, I had left when I was 14."

                " And when the Aktion started, as I mentioned, we were sent to Poland, and when we came to the Polish border, on one side we had the SS with the bayonets pointed at us, and on the other side we had the Polish with bayonets pointed at us, and we were 1n no-man's land for 48 hours before some intervention the Poles opened the border and let us into a very small village. The name is Zbaszyn. There -- I was always an organizer -- so when we went there, there was no housing because it was a small village and here we were about 2,000 people. So we organized. I took a few young people and we put handkerchiefs around our arms, our sleeves, and then we went and cleaned out pig sties where the cattle was and also some housing which were empty. So, there we took care of the old people and the sick people and the children; some children were born right there. And we were in Zbaszyn until six weeks before the war broke out. In the meantime, a lot of people who had family in Poland were released and they went to their people, and so my father also went back to Lodz because he had two brothers living there with their families and I stayed until the last 100 were liquidated in Zbaszyn because it was just about six weeks before the war started. Then I went to Krakow with -- myself with some people that I had befriended and then later to Czestochowa. In Czestochowa, I stayed until I think it was September 1940. The ghetto in Lodz had already been closed the first of May. So, one evening a car came with a man named David Gertler, and he came in where I lived in Czestochowa, because I had corresponded with my sister in Lodz, so she knows where I was. And she had sent this man with an SS man in a private car to pick me up in Czestochowa and took me into the ghetto to be reunited with my sister and father. I was not too long in the ghetto, just a few days, when I got a call from Rumkowski,\u2019 an Elder of the Jews, for a long interview. And there he said, \u201cI want you to take over the labor department because we have to register every Jew, every child in the ghetto because we have to give them work.\u201d For work we will get bread and we can live.

We became, like in other words, terrorists and we got hold of explosives and we broke up -- we bombed their trains, any transport of the SS people and stuff like this. So, we really gave them a hard time. And in 1936, I was arrested for the first time by the Gestapo for three weeks, interrogated every day, the same questions asked, but they could not have any proof or couldn't tell anything of what I had done, so they had to let me go. That was in 1936. Then in '38, I mentioned to you already, I was sent to Zbaszyn in Poland."

            "answer": "Absolutely, yes. When I came to the ghetto, and I was told and I saw with my own eyes, of how the people have to live in the ghetto, and naturally I was right up in arms. I could not digest it that easily. And when the Elders of the Jews called on me to head the department, and naturally I was pleased that I got to do something productive for the ghetto, even though people today have said I worked with the Germans and helped them, which is naturally it's nonsense because if we would not have done what we did in the ghetto, in 1942, that ghetto would have been liquidated completely and no one would have survived. And thanks to Rumkowski, and thanks to his negotiation power he was able to convince the Germans, and actually the Lodz ghetto became a model for all the ghettos in the other areas. So, three days and three nights we registered all the people."

But people themselves, they got a piece of paper with where to go, where to report to, to what factory, and with this they were given 1.d. cards and cards to be able to get food, like food stamps, coupons for food. And this entitled them to a soup. There were various soups around the ghetto where the people who worked the factories were able to get a soup. Some a little bit heavier, some a little bit lighter soups, as you can imagine. And as the time passed, I had, for instance, I took a very sick-looking person out of a factory and delegated him to a kitchen while I took a healthy- looking guy from the kitchen and put him into the factory. So, with one signature of mine I made a friend and an enemy, which you can understand. The ones who worked in the kitchen, they were sitting. They got a little bit more to eat than the others.

            "answer": "Well, they had since the ghetto was closed the first of May. Naturally, all these people coming from the other side of the town into the ghetto had to be housed. So, naturally, there wasn't enough housing available for every family. So you found in most cases that in one room lived four families. In every corner a different family, OK, and the conditions naturally were unbearable to live, really, because there was no running water. There were no toilets in the room. People didn't have bathrooms. They would have to go to outhouses. And they would have to go and pump the water from a pump and bring it up into the room. So, the conditions naturally as you can imagine was anything but human."

The first transport for instance were the three Fs\u201d in German: Fleisher,\u00b0 Fuhrmann\u2019...what was the third F? I don't even remember the third. Well, in any case these three groups, from three groups the transports, the first transports went to a labor camp and a lot of them survived, thank heaven, because they really went to working camps because Auschwitz came later on and naturally we didn't know that.

And then when I saw her face, so it went with it. So, I said to one of my O.D.* men, who was always my lifeguard if you want to call it, I said to him, \"I want to meet this girl. I want to meet this girl. You have to make a date for me.\" And it happened to be that I was at that time I had a slight cold or something. I was home and -- no that was afterwards. So, finally we made a date and he made a date with her not telling her that she had a date with me. So, he made the date with her and it was late at night and she was an hour late and he still was there but he was just about going away when she came. And she came and the whole night she was sitting and talking and I was serenading her, playing on my violin and finally she fell in love with me, too. So, then one evening in November, the 11th of November to be exact, we had -- in a friend's house, she was ready and I went to her parents and I asked for her * Ordnungs Dienst [Organization for public order\" (German). hand. I want to marry their daughter and they allowed this. They said, \u201cOK, you can marry our daughter.\u201d Then I went to the party where we met for the evening and I said, \u201cCongratulations we are engaged to be married.\u201d And that was then the way I met Irene and then we married in June of 1943, by the Elders of the Jews, together with 18 or 19 other couples."

Well, to me in my eyes, yes, because she's a wonderful woman, very bright, very intelligent, and down to earth with a lot of common sense and a tremendous intuition. She knows things which happen later on, she knows beforehand. And so then I got an apartment with a room and a kitchen and I lived there with Irene then. And...so, I got up in the morning like seven o'clock, was at my office at eight, and Irene was also working in one of the factories and we lived there with the various happenings during this time in the ghetto which is already known today by everybody who is interested in it because it's a matter of documentation already of what had happened in between '42 and '44. We have lost a lot of people by transporting them out of the ghetto, by attrition, and as the time passed by more and more and more starved. Of course sickness, hunger and in 1944 the last transport to Auschwitz was the next to the last transport, there was also was the Elders of the Jews, Rumkowski, and all his staff and his wife and his brother, and they went to Auschwitz and unfortunately, as we learned later on, he was immediately killed when he got to Auschwitz. And then we were the last transport out of the ghetto in '44 and we did not go to Auschwitz. We went to Sachsenhausen."

All right, he was a little bit rough, but if you put yourself into his position, what could he have done? Like for instance, the transport when they asked for children, his heart was breaking, but what could he have done, because if he wouldn't have done it, it would have been worse. Because, for instance, a transport was supposed to go out of the ghetto and they could not fulfill the quota, they came in and blocked off, you know, two or three or four houses and took everybody that was found in there and sent them away.

So, naturally, not that I was scared or something like this but everybody had to be careful because you never know what people do when they're desperate. So they kept order. Now, then, as I mentioned we were the last transport. Only 800 people were left in the ghetto officially to liquidate the ghetto. We were sent to Sachsenhausen. In Sachsenhausen, we were there for two weeks and then we were bought as slaves by a firm and we went to Koenigswusterhausen, where there were new barracks put for us and naturally also straw mattresses. We worked and made to cut certain wood and plywoods which we sent away to be assembled -- we didn\u2019t do the assembly -- and we understand they were boxes sent to the eastern front against Russia. They would put certain ice-melting stuff in there, like some flame throwers or something like this, and thank heaven the war did not last two weeks longer because I probably would have been shot for sabotage because what I cut on the circular saw was a quarter of inch too long, a quarter of an inch too short. We dealt with centimeters. It was a half a centimeter less or half a centimeter larger, so, but it wouldn't fit together. So, thank heaven it ended when it ended because otherwise I probably would have been killed for sabotage. What else can I say, what else can I tell you? In the mean time I had other experiences, like my back was broken -- not broken but fractured, because one day I had to go into the forest to build some tank traps and next to me was a man, an elderly man, who could not work. So I did something for him so one of the SS men who watched us came over and told him to work, and he was just leaning over his shovel and said, \u201cI can't, I can't.\u201d So, he hit him, and when he hit him I said I will work for him. I will do his part. So, he gave me over the back with his rifle and I had a slight fracture of L-2, as they call it in that language. And I was hiding for a while because I could not stand, but thank heaven it healed. And I needed an operation which was performed in 1966 and thank heaven everything is all right. So any further details you would like to know?"

You couldn't do anything. This led also to depression. There was no way. You felt like doing something, especially with my hot blood, but what could I have done? We had no weapons. People have asked me, \u201cWhy didn't you make a riot like they did in Warsaw?\u201d Because with whom and with what? The Warsaw ghetto had dealings with the outside. We didn't. They could trade something for weapons. We didn't have anybody to trade with, and we didn't have with what to trade, so how can we compare the Warsaw uprising with Lodz ghetto? Oranges and apples. So naturally whenever we saw any brutality, it hurt. You wanted to cry out and you wanted to kill the guy, but could you have done? You were helpless."

            "answer": "Well, it wasn't much of a career, but I started boxing when I was about 12 years old, and I started to get into the ring with my name on the poster. I must have been 14 years old and I was a junior welter featherweight. I started boxing when I was about 12 years old, started training. The Jewish sport club Bar-Kochba had no boxing in Hannover. We had no boxing, so I joined the Heros-Eintracht boxing club in Hannover. And when I was about 14 I was ready to go into the ring. My name was on the poster and I started boxing as a junior featherweight and I did fairly well, and I was just about ready to go into the championship fights when I was paired against one who was not very friendly towards me because we went to the same school and he was one of the first Nazis. When it came to a championship fight -- no, I'm sorry. I have to go back now. I got him into the ring and I fought him and I won. I won that fight. Then about a year later, at that time the Nazis started already but I was still allowed to box in that club. I fought him the second time and he lost again. Then I saw him for the first time in a SS uniform and when it came to that last fight I just could not hold back but, and I hit him with everything I had and I knocked him out, and he was the one who arrested me in 1938 to bring me in the concert hall where we were sent away into no-man's land. So, that was my boxing career. Then, naturally, I could not go any further because at that time the Nazis were in full swing and full force and a Jew could not any more be in any public place for that reason. So, this was the boxing career to answer your question."

I played two games, at 10 o'clock in the youth and at one o'clock in the second league. So, I was pretty good at it, too. I was a pretty good goalkeeper. And I was an oarsman in high school, and field and track I wasn't too fast in running, but I was in very good physical condition and I think this has helped me in going through the other bad environments I was forced into."

The violin has a very, very sentimental value because it survived the holocaust, and we had as when I walked away from the ghetto that was the only thing I took with me and I kept it until I came to Sachsenhausen where they took it away from me. And they took a accordion away from another colleague, but when we came to Koenigswusterhausen, to the factory where we were slaves, they gave me the violin and they gave him the accordion under the condition that he play for them. So, every so often in the evening we had to play for them and entertain them while they were drinking and laughing and so on. And it helped me also a little bit in the assignment, because as I said, I was on the circular saw, but at one time we had to go to an outside commando to a tank trap, and I had that incident with that elderly man of ours and where I could not see him beaten because he could not do his job so I had to take it for him. I mentioned that to you before, and so this is the violin, and I played until not too many years ago, but my fingers are a little bit arthritic now. They are getting stiff so 1t wasn't for me anymore, so I gave it as a Bar Mitzvah gift to my grandson. He has not played it as yet. He is very good on the piano and he's a tremendous flutist, but maybe one day he will take up the violin, too. He's a very ambitious guy."

They tried to get more food and they did not realize by the same token you have today's strikes which absolutely nonsense because what do they achieve? At that time it was even more ridiculous but they didn't realize that. They just tried and mobilize themselves and tried to better their condition. But naturally it was in vain because what could they do? What could Rumkowski have done? Just because they demonstrated, he could not go to the Germans and say I want more food for my people, all right, and whatever we had we had to work for. So even when I was interviewed by Ross (ph), at his interview with me, he said how do I feel today that I cooperated with the Germans. I didn't cooperate with the Germans. Just because we manufactured something the Germans could use, well, that was our livelihood. That was our bread. And a lot of people don't understand that. Okay, we made munitions parts. Okay we made something the German army could use, but did we have another choice? It was our work and our labor which saved us from complete starvation. What little we got but we got it because we worked for it, so there was no cooperation, you know, with the Germans. So that is a misunderstanding which still goes around in a lot of people. But they don't think. They just go with the masses. Why? Can you imagine that after the all documentation you see in public television and whatever, the Holocaust - the American army when they went into these camps and made all these films of what they found and still people today can say denying that there was such a thing, that it is all propaganda. For what propaganda? Who won the war? The Germans and the Japanese. They didn't lose the war, they won it. The Marshall Plan lift them up until they are one of the biggest nations of the world.

There might have been about 60,000 or 70,000 people left, and all the transports took place at that timeframe. We were taking into the hospital and we stayed there to be transported out of the ghetto. A few days before Rumkowski and Rosenblat (ph), you know, the police chief and his brother and a lot of other dignitaries went with the transport to Auschwitz. We however, went, as I mentioned, to Sachsenhausen and then wound up in Koenigswusterhausen in that factory. And only about 800 people were left to liquidate the ghetto and they came out smelling like a rose because they found all these treasures which were left behind in the ghetto.

But Irene and my sister, they did not come with that transport. They were left in Ravensbrtick and they were liberated by the Russians, as we were also, in April. And just only maybe 50 or 60 women and children came where we were. The rest were left, yes, and we were liberated the 27th of April 1945 at 4:00 in the morning the Russians came. Before, I must tell you, a very bad thing happened. We had also air raid trenches, and every night the sirens, you know, they came during the night we were working and at day time they were bombing. So every time there was an air raid we had assigned places in these trenches. The first few alarms I went with my father and we went to the place where we were supposed to be, but then I said, \"Papa, we are not going anymore.\" I was lying on the floor under the bunks. On this end of the barrack my father was on the other end of the barrack and every time a bomb or grenade hit we called each other to make sure that we were okay because we had 66 shrapnel in our barrack, and where we were supposed to be there were four young brothers. They came originally from Pabianice. They were in our spot where we were and a grenade hit them full blast and all four were wiped out. It would have happened to us if we would have been there. That's fate. That\u2019s fate and that's kismet."

            "question": "Where was David?",
            "answer": "David, he was taken -- oh, yeah, one day towards the end I was sent to the outside commando and when we came back that late afternoon, 70 men had been taken away from the camp, amongst them my father-in-law, may he rest in peace and my brother-in- law, may he rest in peace. They were taken together with the others. They were sent on a march by foot. They were supposed to go up to the North Sea, put on a boat and as a final solution being bombed out and drowned. And my father-in-law, he was shot, after the war had ended already, the third of May. He couldn't walk anymore and they shot him. My brother-in-law was able to escape at that time. So, that was the last few days. And I had my violin. That's all I took. Of course I had a few hidden items there. And I went with my father after the fourth or the fifth day after we were liberated because I said \"Let's not go out because they're still shooting.\" And I went with the Russian commando to organize bread and meat and wurst and whatever. I warned people, \"Don't overeat, take it easy,\" and sure enough a few people overate and got sick and blew themselves up. And I went with father and we went across a field and there was a trunk and it was covered with blood and I could open it and I opened it up and there were money, German money, the Reichsmark, it must have been at least a million or more and I said to my father, \"Papa, if this is here full of blood it's not worth anything because I feel that the Reichsmark will be nothing worth after the war and there will be new money.\" If I would have known that until 1948 these Reichsmarks were good and valid, I would have been a millionaire at that time. I could have bought whole blocks of houses. I didn't even touch it. I didn't even touch one piece of paper money and I walked off with my fiddle. I went over to the Elbe River and there was a Russian commander and I wanted to go across the river because the Americans were on the other side. That's where I wanted to be. I didn't want to be with the Russians. So, I went to the commandant and asked him if I could go with the first transport. They were French, French prisoners of war. They were allowed to cross the Elbe River the next morning and I went to the commandant and asked I would like to go with them. So, I go back to my hometown. So he said, \"You are a German, so you have to wait until the Germans can go.\" So we smuggled, my father and I smuggled ourselves into the group of French people and we made it to the ferry boat and made it across the river. We went to the Americans. I went to the commander there and I introduced ourselves -- what we are and where we are coming from -- and so he asked me a few questions, how is \"father\" in Hebrew, how is \"mother\" in Hebrew and, \u201cWhat kind of brakhah\" do you say over this?\u201d And so I answered him so he knew that, yes, and since then the big love affair between them and us and they wanted to give us everything. I had to help him. I was as, as a, an interpreter for a few days until we could freely travel until everything was clear and before we would get the first papers to travel. So, once I was very eager to go home to my hometown. So the commander gave me a jeep, papers I could go everywhere to get gas. They called it petrol at that time, and papers that I could travel and that I have * blessing (Hebrew.) legitimately this jeep. And so, I started driving and everywhere I asked for my wife, whether somebody has seen my wife. And nobody knew. Nobody said anything. Then I finally came to Hannover, to my hometown, and I started working right away in the town hall and registered all the people who were coming from the various camps and I repatriated people like Poles to Poland and Czechs to Czech and I took them all with various passes to the various border towns and I left them there and I took the buses back home because they were all from the post office. In Germany all the buses are run by the post office. Everywhere I was I asked people, survivors whether they know or have heard of my wife. Then one girl, showed it to her, which she saw the picture of the dolly said Irene was bombed out. She's not alive anymore. And later on Irene told me that she was told that I was bombed out. So, it took us ten months after the liberation that she found me back in my hometown."

            "question": "Was there a problem with your name?",
            "answer": "And we came here and the first dilemma was at the pier. I was the chief interpreter on board the ship and every time the office was down below and every time I had to make the announcement on the deck I had to go all the way up and down and up and down. It was quite strenuous, but this way I earned my trip over to the United States. I didn't feel like I get charity. We came to the pier and I had to wait until the last man left the boat and get them through the customs. Finally, we were the last. I had three big boxes, plywood boxes, big ones, and a total of 11 items of luggage so I had quite, I had all our belongings and a custom agent came and asked me to open up everything. I had three packers packing my trunks at home in Germany before I left and here all by myself it was already about eight at night at that time. Aviva, our daughter, got very sick on board the ship. She had 104 fever and she was at eight. Irene and the child was taken off board the ship and went to the hospital. I didn't know what happened to my child. I didn't know where they were and here I was crying. It was November seven. It was a very raw day, misty, cold and I had to unpack and naturally they didn't find anything. Somebody who loves me showed them that I brought up a fortune and I didn't declare it, but everything I had there was on my declaration, OK? So, to make it short, I had to put everything back into the trunk, nail them down and here they took it away into storage and I went to look for my wife and my daughter and it was not before 10 at night in the Hotel Breslin on Broadway that I heard that my daughter is in the hospital on Metropolitan Island at that time, the Metropolitan Hospital, and I had 20 dollars in my pocket which went away the next day for the taxi fare to the hospital. So, that same night I went to the waterfront and I saw a sign \"help wanted\", and I went in there and the foreman was also of German descent so we spoke German so I got the job. What was the job? 75 cents an hour cleaning the presses. It was a spare box folding box factory on Tenth and -- I don't remember this, it was on 70th or 80th street somewhere -- in any case what was my job? To clean with kerosene the printing presses and the cutting presses. Three months later I was an a sample maker. I made samples and I made one patent for them also, which was patented for which I got a dollar because it was made under their name and their time so I got a dollar for it and then six months later I took over the night shift. I was a superintendent for the night shift. I worked there another three months and every time I wanted a raise they said don't rush the seasons, don't rush the seasons. So, I quit and went to Bulova. \u201cWhat I am?\u201d \u201cAn engineer.\u201d And I started up at Bulova, a watch company, and they found out I had pyrotechnic experience so I went, I got clearance, secret clearance and I went on the missile program. It was a very interesting job I started there and I was with Bulova close to 11 years, over 10 years. Then I was involved in the correspondence with another outfit, Daystrom, who had to take a bid on a big program also in the missile field, and they had heard of me because I had made myself a name already. So, they wanted me, and another firm, TRW, in Cleveland, they wanted me so I went for an interview and first to Cleveland. I spent the whole day and at that time we were in Scranton, we lived in Scranton and then I went to Strattford in Connecticut to Avco. I spent a whole day being interviewed there and they made me an offer I could not refuse. So since my contract at Daystrom had a two year option that I felt I should not take, I went to work for Avco Lycoming in Strattford for 20 years, and I went up to, to become a director of a department with about 400 people."

We had to take a ferry from somewhere down in Maryland, I guess, to go across to Norfolk, Cape May, I guess, Cape May it was. And we come to Norfolk and they received us there with open arms and brought us to an apartment, and Irene and I felt like crying. That much dirt on the floor, a refrigerator with a motor on top yet, you know, like 1850. And we looked at her, thanked her for it, and all night long Irene and I with the razor blades we're scraping the floor. The next morning, I met the people I should work with and I came back home and I said, we really thanked them from the bottom of our hearts, but we don't stay here, this is not for us. We went to New York."

They interrogated me. Every week I was called. Every week I heard the same questions standing up. This went on for over a year, almost a year and a half. One day I come, \"Mr. Fuchs, sit down.\" So I sat down. \"Now we can tell you, you have good friends.\" I said, \"What happened?\" \"They said that you were a Gestapo man, and that you have a lot of people on your conscious. But now we found out that it's not you. There was a Gestapo man with your name, Kommisar Fuchs.\u201d He said, \"They thought it's you. We give you the papers now, and we allow you to change your name through us so you don't have to go through court.\" So we were driving home with Irene and she saw Rhonda Fleming on a movie house. So she said, \"Fleming, that's a good name, let's be Fleming, so we don't have to change our initials, Bernard Fuchs, Bert Fleming, it's the same initials.\" So that's the game by what we become Fleming."

When I heard this, I went to my Rabbi, Rabbi Stein, and I said, \"Rabbi, this and this and this happened. This and this accusations were made, and I would like to take this woman for a deen Torah.\u2019\u201d\u201d'\u201d That means for a rabbinical justice, a rabbinical court. So he investigated very thoroughly. He called Europe. He called the organizations here of the former Lodge people. He finally came to the end result and told that woman, \"You better keep your mouth shut, because he can sue you for everything you have.\" And he told me, \"Bert, don't worry about it. Everything is fine.\""
