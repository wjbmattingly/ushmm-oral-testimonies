            "answer": "Yes, we \u2014 the farms in that part of Poland were a kind of a variety farm. The land was rather poor, so they planted just about everything that they needed and in \u2014 everything they could sell. They planted a lot of cabbage and a plenty of potatoes and some wheat and also a lot of rye. Our land was in many little pieces, so we had to travel from a village to work on, on the land. My father \u2014 just about like me \u2014 spent a lot of time in strange places. The part of Poland that we lived in before 19 \u2014 in \u2014 before 1900\u2019s, were occupied by Russia, Czarist Russia. My father was conscripted, or drew a lot and spent 12 and a half years in Czar\u2019s imperial army. He came back home for six months and the first war \u2014 world war started. He was called again and did fight on the western front against \u2014 against Germans. And of course he heard some Polish people speaking across the front lines, so he walked across one night and thought he would join them. Instead of that, they put him in a prisoners of war came \u2014 camp. And they sent him way, way out west, close to the western front line betw \u2014 a li \u2014 a front line between France and Germany. And again, well he was \u2014 at that time he was a sapper. He was a fortification specialist. So the Germans gave him a group of people, group of prisoners and they built fortifications \u2014 a kind of a front line fortification system at Verdun. And probably everybody heard of that horrible battle at Verdun, where more than half a million people were killed. So he did, and the Germans of course, were very appreciative, so he put him in a fr \u2014 one morning they put him in a front of a squad that he was in and gave him German Ritterkreuz* or, or Eisern\u2014Eisernekreuz\u2019 \u2014 German, German decoration, because the part that he built there \u2014 the French could not overrun it. They tried several time, they couldn\u2019t overrun it. Anyway, a few days later, he heard Polish people speaking across the line on the French side. So he walked across. And the Po \u2014 he joined Polish Legion that was fighting on the French side. Couple nights later he led the French into the part of the fortification that he built. They overran it, they kicked the Germans out * Knight\u2019s Cross (German) * Tron Cross (German) and the French gave him the Croix de Guerre*. So he had German decoration, he had French decoration. Later on, the Polish Legion gave him Virtuti Militari,\u2019 Polish cross. So when my father came back home after the wars, he didn\u2019t brag much about it. As a matter of fact, my family didn\u2019t know about it. I was the only one that he showed the crosses to and he told little about what happened. When he came home, he brought some things. He brought a French army coat and he brought a pair of American army boots. And he had those boots until 1940\u2019s. They were pair of clodhoppers. They had a big, round toes, but he said, \u201cThose are the best boots I ever had.\u201d They were ugly, but he said, \u201cThey are sewed, they are glued and nailed. You can never wear them out.\u201d Occasionally on \u2014 on a big holiday, he would put those boots on and para\u2014 shine them and parade around it. And everybody was look and said, \u201cJan, where do you get those ugly boots?\u201d He said, \u201cYou better shut up, those are American boots, those are the best boots I ever had.\u201d"

            "answer": "There were political parties, but they were just practically two. There was the Nationalist party, which was very small and hardly anybody joined it because they were kind of chauvinistic and there was the so-called \u201cnon-party\u201d party, which was the government party. And most people were kind of \u2014 not exactly joining it, but supporting it, because all the politicians and all the representatives were members of that party. There was quite a lively social life. There were mostly \u2014 mostly religious holidays and feasts that people took part in it. Like for instance, when the month of May came, every night after supper, everybody went to a little shrine and they would be singing lot of hymns and they would sing a litany to all the saints and then you would walk home and sing loudly. There was a fair, one or two or three religious fairs, that special preachers would come to the church and we would walk to church and listen to the preachers and there were booths and souvenirs toe \u2014 tables. And food tables, where you would spend little money to get some food that you normally did not eat at home. Well, every Tuesday there was a marketplace, market day. You would \u2014 father would hitch a horse and we\u2019d take some butter and eggs and some grain and some potatoes and drive to Kaluszyn, where the market took place and the people from a city would \u2014 housewife would come and buy your butter and buy your eggs. And Kaluszyn was a town of about 12,000 people, of whom about 10,000 were Jewish people. Jewish people were merchants, they were professional, they were attorneys, they were doctors. They were tailors and shoemakers. And we traded with them throughout our lives. We always had a family or two or three that we\u2019re very friendly with and visited when we went there. We would start their place and maybe get a cup of tea. When they came to see us, we would give them a dozen of eggs and when they came to visit on the farm."

Later on he had a wife and two children. And relations were not strained. We kind of tolerated one another. All Polish Jewish people were Orthodox people. They wore special dress, they had sideburns, they had peyse\u2019\u00ae, the long side hair. They wore gabardine coats, they wore little hats, with a \u2014 little tiny, black hats with a tot \u2014 little tiny visor. And they spoke very broken Polish."

There was a Jewish cheder, they went and they learned to \u2014 how to write Yiddish and some of them would learn Hebrew. And socially we did not have much to do together. Socially, we kept completely apart. We did not mix, or if they did, it was very little mixing between the Jewish people and Polish people."

She brought sacharyna\u2019 to sell, she brought needles, she brought thread, she brought little pieces of material. She brought occasionally a dress or two.

And we went to special preparation like for first communion or confirmation. We would go to church in groups that \u2014 which reached certain age and were prepared.

And we kids hated \u00b0 Earlocks worn by Hasidic Jews (Yiddish) \u2019 Saccharine (Polish) it because we had to kneel for about 45 minutes on a hard floor, so we squirmed and we complained, but quietly, because father did not take any guff from any kid."

They lived in a big, ramshackle house. His wife brought a bunch of books. Those were th\u2014 those were the books I was not supposed to read. They\u2019re called in the French Romances. Of course I did, I sneaked out and read them, I mean I just read them day and night. And of course I got caught. My mother said, \u201cAha. Those books you are not supposed to read, but I guess I won\u2019t prevent you from reading it, so to counter with, every night after supper, after you eat supper, you are going to read the Bible, aloud.\u201d \u201cBible? What do I want to read the Bible for?\u201d \u201cWell, you are going to read it if you want to or not.\u201d So I did, for half an hour, then 45 minutes, then one hour. The neighbor\u2019s kids were laughing, \u201cHoo, he is reading Bible.\u201d Pretty soon the neighbors kids started coming in to listen, because the Old Testament stories are fascinating, bloody and murder at times. Especially if you come to the Book of Judith, I mean that was a real story. So, after supper, there\u2019d be a bunch of kids sitting, later on, in winter, I mean and we had no electricity, just a ga\u2014 a kerosene lamp there. Adult neighbors would be coming and listening to those stories of Old Testament, especially the Book of Judith when she \u2014 she went to sleep with him and got up in a middle of a night, I mean the leader, the whole affair and this leader of the Philistines \u2014 got up in a middle of a night, chopped off his head and took it with her. I mean, those were great stories. By the time I was 14, I read the Bible aloud twice. So I pretend to know something about Bible."

The \u2014 Warsaw was still fighting, but they went around and approached our neighborhood. There was quite a sharp firefight in my village. Started early morning \u2014 the Polish cavalry came in and some infantry came in. The cavalry dismounted and sent horses back and they dug in on the periphery of my village. They had a whole bunch of little, anti-tank artillery. Was two fat wheels, and a horse and they could pull it like the dickens. Two men could pull that little thing. It was very effective against German tanks. So they dug in and they were waiting, and of course, the Germans attacked. And it\u2019s kind of strange, my father said, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you take the cows to the pasture?\u201d And my father dug a dugout for the family, in a garden in the orchard, so they were \u2014 went all there and I took their horses and the cows to the pasture in the back \u2014 way back, beyond the village \u2014 it was a communal pasture. By the time I \u2014 I did get there, I couldn\u2019t come back because there was a \u2014 I mean, was honest to goodness firefight. It was long distance artillery German \u2014 German artillery shooting. And a \u2014a kind of bombarding the neighborhood, there was a \u2014 more machine guns going all over, so I just stayed behind the village, there, for about two hours. In about two hours, the Poles retreated and went and then came two cavalry men, who said, \u201cHey, little boy, do you know that little wood across the hill, there?\u201d \u201cOf course I know it.\u201d \u201cWe have horses '' Armed forces (German) there, about 15 horses, can you go and get the horses here?\u201d \u201cOh, sure. Why not?\u201d So I started running, kind of over the hill \u2014 I run over the hill and there was lot of firing and going and then I see \u2014 all of a sudden, I was kind of running on the border of a hi \u2014 of a \u2014 of a field. The border was kind of a strip of grass, it was higher than a field and I see right by my feet there, dust flying. And I didn\u2019t think \u2014 think much of it, but it was somebody shooting machine gun from a way, way distance there \u2014 German machine gun and hitting right where I was running, below my feet. It was several times, right below my feet. Apparently, whoever was shooting, was shooting little too low, thank goodness. When I ran to \u2014 I ran over the hill, the horses were gone. So I laid down behind a bunch of trees, big Olszyna'\u201d trees. There were such trees here. And artillery was shooting and hitting in \u2014 in transit was hitting a top of a trees and branches were falling down. So I just laid there for about half an hour, then it slowed down, I went back to the village, village was on fire and about two-thirds of the village was burned. There were nobody \u2014 no civilian casualties. There were about 35 Polish soldiers, who were killed. There were about 100 of Germans who were killed, back in approach the village. There were about 11 tanks that were mashed to smithereens by those little ca \u2014 Polish cannons. And of course the Poles ran away and the Germans came in. We were taking \u2014 getting water in pails, out of a \u2014 out of a well and I was \u2014 I climbed up on a top of a roof to prevent our house from being burned, because the neighbors house were burning, so I was handed the pails of water, I was pouring on the \u2014 on the roof of the house to prevent it from burning on. And the refugees who are running around the Warsaw, the bunch \u2014 were a group of people from Warsaw who were running around, \u201cWhat will happen to us, what will happen to us? The Germans are going to kill us.\u201d Well, the German patrol came down the village and they just came, they didn\u2019t bother anybody, went across the village and went into the woods beyond the village, where the Polish army escaped. And more patrols came and more patrols came. But they were very correct, they did not bother anybody. They questioned a few men and they took document \u2014 asked for documents and they did not bother anybody. In \u2014 in other places, they would take young men and \u2014 and kill them.

            "answer": "Waked up in su\u2014 before sunrise, counting \u2014 Appell\u2019, counting. You got a pot of tea, which was made out of birch leaves. You got a little, tiny piece of bread, maybe half an ounce or so. You ate it. Then you dressed up and you went walking. If you remember, about four or five years ago, where there was a Olympics in Sarajevo, they showed the Russian Siberian man, who was a weightlifter and a wrestler, how he ran a mile in the snow that deep? This is the snow we walked in. It was two guards and about 50 of us and we walked. And the person who walked ahead was changed every hundred feet or so. If, for \u2014 sometime for punishment, if they made one person walk all way, a mile or two or \u201d Felt boots (Polish) *\u00bb Roll call (German). three miles to the place of work. He \u2014 by the time he got there, he was dead \u2014 breaking the snow. So we went \u2014 we cut trees for about five hours, then came soup at noon. People came with sleds from a camp, with big kettles of fish and cabbage soup. It was mostly water. We sat down and ate the soup, then we cut tree \u2014 trees again and stacked them and came back. Six p.m., we started on the way home, we got there by seven or so. Were counted again, got another pot of tea and a little slice of bread and of course to sleep. We had a good guard. I mean he was a damn Soviet, but he was a good guy, the guard. I mean, he was just out of this world. When we did get there, said, \u201cTea. Make fire.\u201d So we made fire. \u201cMake big fire. Sit and rest.\u201d So we sat around and rest. And he looked at his watch, he had a Polish watch that he stole during 1939 campaign, said \u201cpolsky chasy.\u201d'\u201d Polish watch runs well. \u201cGo and cut.\u201d So we went and cut for about, oh probably one hour. So then, \u201cHey, come on back.\u201d So we came back. \u201cSit and rest. Soup coming.\u201d Oh, in about one hour, soup came. \u201cEat.\u201d We ate. \u201cSit and rest.\u201d We sat and rest. \u201cGo and cut.\u201d So went and cut for about one hour. And he \u2014 then he went \u2014 came to us there where we were. \u201cNow, go and steal.\u201d So we went stealing. A prisoner had to cut a cubic yard of wood a day. And regardless how young, how strong, how big you were, you could never do it. If you didn\u2019t cut a square yard per person, your group didn\u2019t, at night your soup was cut, your bread was cut accordingly. Next day you were weaker. In a week you were gone. So we would go and steal the wood that we cut day before and day before and day before stack it up, he would measure it. \u201cOkay, now we sit down and rest, we go home soon. Make bigger fire.\u201d So we went home. That Ivan Ivanovich was a damn good man. Also, I was lucky. I spoke some English, I spoke some German. I spoke Russian quite well. When my father and mother wanted us kid not to know what was going on, they spoke Russian. My mother was a Russian teacher in middle school before she got married. My father was of course, Russian speaking person. So we kids learned it in a hurry. We knew exactly what was going on. On the train for six weeks, by the time we got to Siberia, my Russian was almost as good as my English. Much more colorful because I knew a lot of swear words. So they found out and I was called to the commanders office and he said, \u201cYou stay here, you translate.\u201d And he got the German word, \u201cYou dolmetscher.*\u201d\u201d \u201cYou interpreter.\u201d I don\u2019t know how he got that German word, I knew what it was, but \u201cYou dolmetscher.\u201d When new prisoners came, I would get up on that barrel and I would shout, \u201cHis Excellency, Commander so and so says this and says that and says that. You don\u2019t do this, you don\u2019t do that. You get shot for this, you get in solitary for that. You get hunged up for this. So remember.\u201d And of course, after a few days, I\u2014 one time a group of Czechs came and I got up on the barrel and I became kind of \u2014 took it for granted, became rambunctious \u2014 young, stupid kid. And I said, \u201cCommander Mika-Mikhail Ivishenerovich, that son of a dog says this and this and *! Polish watch (Russian) ** Interpreter (German) this.\u201d And in Polish it\u2019s skurwysyn,~ in Russian, it\u2019s sukin-syn.~* In English, of course, you know what it is. So he came and he knocked me down and he kicked me. Said, \u201cYou little so and so, you called me sukin-syn.\u201d Said, \u201cI called you Excellency, and Excellency in Polish \u2014 in Czech, and sukin-syn sounds almost close together. I call you Excellency.\u201d \u201cOh no, I know Polish and I know Czech, you call me sukin-syn. If you say that again, Pll shoot you, you little so and so.\u201d Said, \u201cCommander, I did not say it, but I will not sa\u2014 ever say it again if I did.\u201d I thought my goose was cooked, but it wasn\u2019t. So I stayed in barrack, I peeled potatoes, I swept the barracks. I had a norm man, a man who wrote the norms for the people, what people did during the day. I helped him do the norms. The classification, how much soup at night everybody gets. And I learn how to cheat, how to write up \u2014 how to cheat so that people made more than they did. Anyway, I made it."

They wer\u2014 they were the Samoyed people. Siberian people like American Eskimos. Samoyed people raised reindeer and fished. So I went and wandered around and a young boy came and talked to me, he said, \u201cWho you are?\u201d \u201cKto vy takoy?\u201d\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, I am Polish.\u201d And, \u201cChto eto takoy?\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201cWhat is that?\u201d Said, \u201cWell, I am from a country way, way west.

Yurta is a kind of a conical tent made of bearskins, double bearskin \u2014 four out and four in. And it\u2019s kind of a good size, about the size of this living room here, about 12, 15 feet in diameter. But if you get into the yurta, if you \u2014 they use a \u2014 long handed hatchets, like American Indian tomahawks. If you pick up the hatchet and put it like this and take your hand off, the hatchet will stay there, the air is so thick. The Samoyed had people wash twice a year, if they have to or not. And they cook, they sleep, they make babies, they do everything in the yurta. I mean the smell is overpowering. But they say, \u201cNever mind, pribyknyesh\u201d \u2014 you get used to it.\u201d So I ate a lot of fish and the young man said, \u201cYou come tomorrow?\u201d \u201cIf I can, I come tomorrow.\u201d So he gave me some fish, I took the fish to the camp. I shared some with the guards, I shared some with fellow prisoners. Next day I couldn\u2019t go, so third day I went and, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d \u201cStefan.\u201d \u201cWe call you Stepka. Khorosho, kak Vas velichat\u2019?\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201cHow do we call you?\u201d Velichat\u2019\u201d\u201d, it means, you use you name, your father\u2019s name. So I said my father was Jana. \u201cOkay, Stepka Ivanovich, come on and eat.\u201d So we ate. \u201cYi\u2014 How much time do you have?\u201d \u201cOh, some time.\u201d \u201cWe'll go fishing.\u201d So we went fishing. So they gave me \u2014 gave me harpoon and we walked, on the River Lena. And I fell in. I didn\u2019t know what was what. River Lena is a very brisk river. The ice that time was probably 20 feet thick, but there \u00b0\u00b0 Who are you such? (Russian) *\u2019 What is that such? (Russian) *\u00ae You get accustomed (Russian) *\u201d Good, what are you called? (Russian) ~\u2019 To be called by name (Russian) were wash-outs, little bubbles. If you step on the bubble, you go in. I was lucky, I had the harpoon. So I fell only in \u2014 that way I got wet. It was not very cold, just about maybe 25 below zero. So two of them grabbed me and ran back \u2014 ran to the \u2014 back to the yurta where I s \u2014I stripped. And he said, \u201cWell, I loan you my suit.\u201d His suit was made of silver foxes. Big pants up to here and a big parka, with a big, huge hood \u2014 silver fox outfit, and reindeer. It was soft as silk. Because this man had three suits and he had three wives. Good Siberian women can make only one suit at a time. She has to chew the skin. Siberian wives has teeth just about three millimeters long, where they constantly chew the skin. You \u2014 you tan it and then you invert it and you chew the inside of it to make it soft, and becomes \u2014 either the chewing process or the saliva makes it as soft as silk. So I wore his suit. Went fishing again, we caught some sturgeon. They made a hole ina bubble, we got some sturgeon, we came back. We cooked some fish, we ate some fish. My suit was still wet so he said, \u201cYou wear my suit.\u201d So I went. I was the best dressed prisoner in the whole damn Soviet system. I came, everybody\u2019s oh-ing and oo-ing and the guards and especially the chachainsis.*' There were bunch of chachainsis. Chachainsis is a bunch \u2014 a bunch of son of a guns. They are cutthroats, they are thieves, they are murderers, everything. They kept looking. \u201cOh, too bad he 1s so small. Oh, too bad he is so small. We would take it off you.\u201d \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t take it off me.\u201d \u201cT wouldn\u2019t?\u201d I said that, \u201cWhat would you do to me?\u201d \u201cCut your head off, you stupid so and so.\u201d \u201cYou little so and so, you would cut my head off? We cut your head off.\u201d They frequently would \u2014 if somebody wa-\u2014 had something they didn\u2019t\u2014 didn\u2019t want to give, they would come and cut his head off at night and took whatever they wanted. Anyway, they became my friends and protectors. I don\u2019t know why. I was just like a, like a little to\u2014 a flea, in comparison with them."

            "answer": "Yeah, it was close to \u2014 1t were close to Teheran, it was west of Teheran. It was kind of a desert area and there was some local people who traveled with herds of sheep and such, from place to place, so we would stay overnight with them. We just sleep outside, it was \u2014 you know, subtropics, it was warm and the \u2014 the British built camps already, so we went to the camp that was built for the refugees, by the British. And of course, pretty soon they started asking young men to come to lectures and come to training and, \u201cDo you want to fight?\u201d \u201cOf course, what do you think? I\u2019m going \u2014 I came here for it.\u201d And many people joined. And then I don\u2019t know if I want to divert. I think I will have to divert back, before I \u2014 I left Siberia. About six months after we be \u2014 were there, they fished out 17 young boys, between 16 and 19. And I was one of them and we went through a heavy indoctrination course. Eight, 10, 12 weeks, eight hours a day. Heavy indoctrination course. And if you \u2014 if I get the three of you in a secluded place, that you are not allowed to leave, in about two weeks, you'll believe any \u2014 everything that I will tell you. They \u2014 there\u2019s nothing better than Communism. Dialectical materialism is the only doctrine that works among peoples. Soviet Russia is the most powerful, most wise, most \u2014 the best of all, the richest. We have the riches in Siberia that you never heard of. We have enormous Ukrainian plains that we can \u2014 if we \u2014 planting our grain, we can s \u2014 we can feed the whole world. This is the best. You had to listen closely, you have to listen attentively. If you smirked, if you made a face, if you make a funny remark, you were thrown \u2014 your shoes were taken, your jacket was taken, you were thrown into solitary, which was six \u2014 what \u2014 four by four feet. Your shoes were taken, too, overnight. You had to dance, jump, run all night. If you sat down, you never waked up. Well, I was lucky, I spent only three nights. I couldn\u2019t keep my tongue. I mean I couldn\u2019t keep my mouth shut. I had to make remarks. I made faces, I laughed in his face, the politruk was a big man, had a face that was asking for a brick, too. I just sm\u2014 laughed in his face. And I told him once, \u201cHow little you know.\u201d So he was lenient with me, but still he, still he throw me in, in the solitary, one night at a time. If you spent two nights, you didn\u2019t make it. Some people \u2014 there were a few people who made it for two nights. Three nights nobody made, in a row. Anyway, by the time we graduated, we had a talk, 45 minute talk. And if you missed two words, you were thrown into solitary, had to repeat it. You had to give a lecture that told everything about the dialect \u2014 dialectical materialism. You knew all about Engels*\u2019, you knew all about Marx.\u00b0? You knew everything about Lenin.*\u00ae And you most about Stalin.\u2019 I mean those were the holy \u2014 not a trinity, but a quadruplinity. And you had to talk about them in glowing terms. Your tone of your voice had to be just like a great * Friedrich Engels \u00b0\u00b0 Karl Marx \u00b0\u00b0 Vladimir Ilich Lenin \u00b0\u2019 Joseph Stalin sermon on a mount. And you know, by the \u2014 by the end of it, I believed, strongly. I became a honest to goodness believer. So when we were later let go and I think it was somewhat with premeditation that this little group was let go into the British part. Because we going to be the avant-garde of Communism. We are going to get introduced into armed forces or whatever groups there were and we\u2019re going to propagate it by going \u2014 we are going to be the true believers. And there \u2014 for some way or another, the British knew it. They collected us again. We went through a heavy indoctrination by the Polish political officers, by the British, who some spoke Polish, some worked with the translators. In about three weeks we lost the faith. We lost the true faith. And then they formed the armed forces. Yes, let\u2019s say they went to fight, they fought, fought all way to Monte Cassino. By Monte Cassino \u2014 when they took Monte Cassino, the second Polish corps \u2014 after British and the Australians and the Americans couldn\u2019t take it, they were so bloodied, they were sent to recuperation\u2014"

And the same and the same. And then sabotage, blowing up bridges, blowing up trains, blowing up buildings. Demolishing rail \u2014 train tracks, if you did not have explosives. And a lot \u2014 a lot of training with semi and automatic weapons. It was a time when the British introduced a sten gun and we trained a lot with the sten guns. We trained little with regular rifles, but they said, \u201c\u201cWhen you get there, we will provide you with sten guns, you will have a lot of firepower.\u201d And a sten gun is similar to American Thompson submachine gun. But it\u2019s a piece of junk, actually. You shoot about 1700 rounds and you throw it away, because after 1700 rounds, becomes more dangerous to you than to your pos\u2014 opponent. Anyway, seven of us went on a trip. We walked, we rode trains, we hitched up rides on the tracks. We rode donkeys most of the time. We went through the western Iran, into northern Iraq. We went through the Kurdistan. By the way, the Kurdish people are the greatest people ever. They can cut your head off, if you have \u2014 if you have something they like, but if you come in, it is so much like in \u2014 in Poland, \u201cGuest in, God in.\u201d They treat you like you were a god visit-visiting them. They give you food. They give you \u2014 what they have, they share with you. If you are ragged, they will give you shirt or pair of pants. But don\u2019t look at anything good they have, because they will give it to you. If you look at something, \u201cOh gee, this is so neat.\u201d They will let you sleep with his \u2014 with his wife if you like her. But you get out of a tent, they will follow you, cut your head off and take the stuff back. So we\u2019re told, \u201cBe careful with the Kurds.\u201d Anyway, we walked through part of Turkey, we diverted into Syria and backed in Anatolia, Turkey, Anatolia. We did come to Bosporus Straits and we were kind of pursued at that time, we knew something was happening. We were being hunted. So we met a old fisherman on the Bosporus and he spoke Russian. He was an old Turk who spoke Russian. And said, \u201cGrandpa, please take us across.\u201d And he said, \u201cLords, night 1s falling, there\u2019s going to be storm tonight, we cannot get a \u2014 go across.\u201d \u201cGrandpa, please take us across, because we \u2014 if we don\u2019t leave here tonight, we may not be alive tomorrow. We know something is happening.\u201d The German had a Intelligence pe\u2014 Intelligence people in Turkey and they organized pursuit parties, we overheard before then. So he said, \u201cWell, Lords, I\u2019m old, my boat is leaky and if you want to risk, what am I to say?\u201d So we said, \u201cGrandpa, we\u2019ll pay you.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to be paid.\u201d So we said, \u201cGrandpa, we\u2019ll give you the donkeys.\u201d \u201cDonkeys, they\u2019re not worth anything. They are worn up completely.\u201d Said, \u201cGrandpa, you give them on a p \u2014 good grass, they\u2019 Il be as good as new in two or three weeks. Leave them here.\u201d We got in the boat, he gave each a \u2014 each one of us a piece of rope. \u201cTie yourself ti\u2014 s \u2014 well.\u201d Storm came. It was the scariest five hours I lived in my life \u2014 scariest. I was in dark places, but this was the worst. I think I fell out about four times. If it wasn\u2019t for rope, I wouldn\u2019t be talking to you tonight. The Mediterranean fish would have eaten me up. Anyway, we did get to the Turkish side on the north side of \u2014 it was almost morning. Beautiful, quiet, sun was coming up. And the old Ismael said, \u201cLords, the Allah was with you. I don\u2019t want to be paid.\u201d But before we left, the British gave us some gold pieces. \u201cCase you\u2019re in a tight spot, trading, whatever.\u201d So we said, \u201cGrandpa, we don\u2019t want to pay you, we just want to give you baksheesh, a gift from the heart.\u201d And each one of us gave him a gold piece. He looked, said, \u201cOh my Allah. My granddaughter will get married, my younger daughter will get married, my grandson get married, I can pay dowry to every one of them and I\u2019m going to live high on the hog for the rest of my days.\u201d He got in his boat and a little breeze came, he just zoomed out of there. And we walked across a part of Turkey, went into Bulgaria, we caught rides on trains \u2014 tracks, we head into Romania. We sneaked into Nazi occupied Poland. You know, the front li\u2014 eastern front was way, way out. By that time, on Polish territory, the Germans developed Einsatzgruppen,\u201d\u00ae special forces. They call them Einsatzgruppen or Vernichtungsgruppen,\u201d\u2019 the exterminators. So they were killing lot of Jewish people and they were killing all the Jewish people they could find. And they were killing a lot of Polish people. So the Polish underground suffered for a time. But then, when we came, they provided us with arms and ammunition and some unstable Polish dynamite. And we \u2014 each one of us \u2014 I was given 17 people. Seventeen plus two, plus \u2014 plus me. That were 20 people. And we became the exterminators of exterminators. We would create false alarms. Because when something happen in certain village or little town, they would just swoop upon it. They \u2014 those groups were about 100, 75 to 125 in each group. They would swoop around, swoop in, surround it, burn it down, kill everybody. That was their standard procedure. And when they went to a ghetto, they would just kill all the Jewish people in the ghetto. Of course, ghettos were already fenced in \u2014 barbed wired in. So we did few things with them and we blew up \u2014 we could not blow up \u2014 blow up complete bridge, but we blew up parts of a bridge. We demolished a lot of railroad tracks. We blew up some trains when we had explosives. And I was \u2014 oh, my gosh, my commander was a \u2014I still don\u2019t know his name. His name was, was \u201cB. Dab\u201d \u2014 \u201cB. the Old Oak.\u201d He said, \u201cYou little shit, \u2019m going to shoot you, I\u2019m going to court martial you, you missed it.\u201d I would sit in a field with the two wires and a battery, holding here and I would touch it and the damn thing would not explode and the train would go by. Or sometime I would blow it up before the train came. So after each incident \u2014 mishap like this, he would gave me a dressing and threaten me with, with an execution and court martial and God knows what. He was a big, fat man with a very sharp temper. *\u00ae Task forces (German); mobile killing units, employed especially in the destruction of the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe. *\u2019 Annihilation group (German) And we slept in bunks. We slept on farms that were far away from habitations. We had dugouts in half a dozen different forests. Run around constantly. We did get surrounded a lot of times. We had to fight \u2014 were in lot of firefights with those groups. Were surrounded frequently by them and had to fight our way out. And about \u2014 in 1943, it was \u201842, fall and winter when we started. Forty-three, in late spring, we hijacked German army bank on a street of Warsaw. We lost three people out of about 25 or 30 that were \u2014 but we got a lot of money. We got about 15 million marks. Each one was \u2014 one of us was given a bonus, and you were given operating expenses. I think we \u2014 my group got about half a million marks. And I had a drinking buddy, who was a young, German soldier, supply officer. So we had drinks, we met few times. I introduced him to some Polish girls. And we talked and he sold me about over 100 Schmeissers. Schmeisser 1s a light, automatic weapon, similar to American Thompson submachine gun, but much, much more effective. Much more effective. And I don\u2019t know how many, probably about 12, 15 million rounds of ammunition. So from then on, my little group of 17 plus three were carrying 27 Schmeissers, because some of the boys said, \u201cI don\u2019t trust that damn German weapon, I want to carry two.\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, you know, we have a \u2014 we join \u2014 we shared those with some other groups, but we have plenty of it in places, hidden places. If you want to carry 17 extra pounds, what am I to say? Go ahead, be my guest.\u201d The German groups \u2014 ordinarily each squad had one Schmeisser and the rest of them had manual Mauser rifles. So when we \u2014 from then on, we \u2014 on purpose, did \u2014 when it cato\u2014 came to firefight, let ourselves be surrounded. And then when we opened up, we went just like a hot knife through a piece of butter. They had to keep their heads down, or they lost them. And anybody who stuck their head up did not get up again. So we went out and went out and went out and \u2014 course we were losing people. At the start we lost like 11 people in two months. So the boys who were in my group said, \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I tried to train you, you refused to be trained. You think you know everything. You were as full of beans, you want to fight, well do \u2014 surely we fight, but are going to lose people constantly if you don\u2019t want to train.\u201d So they said, \u201cDo anything that \u2014 to train us.\u201d So we did. For about four weeks, we got the guts out of ourselves. We did it the British way. The way the British Major Thompson did to us, we did to ourselves. From then on we became almost invincible. We would lose a person from time to time, but very, very seldom."

            "answer": "We drop back to countryside, we took a week or two off, then we \u2014 most of the time we found the places we wanted to take care of ourselves. Sometime our commander would contact us and gave us \u2014 gave us an order to do this or to do that. And there was a \u2014 one of the Eisengrupp \u2014 Eisens \u2014 Eis \u2014 Einsatzgruppen in neighborhood where my \u2014 not exactly my own family neighborhood, but close by. It was in a town called Biala Podlaska. It was about 100 kilometers east of Warsaw. There was the group that was large, it was very well entrenched. Very, very foxy, we just couldn\u2019t do anything to them. So he called me the carpet and he said, \u201cYou are supposed to take care of that group. You don\u2019t sa\u2014 you don\u2019t have to kill all of them, but really give them a good thrashing.\u201d I said, \u201cCommander, I tried \u2014 we tried everything, I tried everything, nothing works.\u201d Said, \u201cYou have to do something.\u201d \u201cThey are entrenched. They stay in a solid building, which used to be monastery, with a great gate. They built a wall around, there\u2019s some barbed wire on the top of it. There\u2019s electricity in the barbed wire. We just can\u2019t touch them.\u201d So he said, \u201cWell, we can, come on here.\u201d Led me to the next room, open a wardrobe and he said, \u201cLook at this. You see this nice, little Hitlerjugend\u201d\u00b0 uniform?\u201d And I said, \u201cOh, no you don\u2019t.\u201d Said, \u201cOh yes, I do.\u201d And as you can see, I was a little blonde boy \u2014 little blonde boy, this one on the right. This one here, with blue eyes and very, very bleached, bleached hair. So he said, \u201cPut it on.\u201d So I put the thing, fitted me just right and a little \u2014 little \u2014 little jacket, shorts, you know. High socks, hobnail boots, little dagger, little hat. Said, \u201cThere, you look like a damn German Hitlerjugend.\u201d So I didn\u2019t have much choice. In the afternoon, the boys brought me within about two or three blocks from that monastery. I just walked toward the gates, there were two burly SS men with the Schmeissers standing by the gate. And I said, \u201cHeil Hitler, Heil Hitler.*! Wie geht\u2019s denn, Junge*\u201d\u201d \u201cGanz gut.*\u201d \u201cHow are you young man?\u201d \u201cVery well.\u201d \u201cWie geht\u2019s denn, Herr Oberst.**\u201d How about you, Commander? \u201cGanz gut.\u201d So I said, \u201cI - Ich wiinschte mit ihre officer gesprochen.\u201d\u201d\u201d I want to speak to your officer, your commander here. \u201cWeiter- weitermachen.*\u00b0\u201d \u201cGo right in.\u201d So I went in, I went through the corridors, I went up the steps, I went to the back there and there was an outside window, I unlatched the window. I went downstairs again, I went to the back and I notice there\u2019s a gate there with a bolt, so I pulled the bolt slowly out. Then I went to the corr\u2014 second floor again \u2014 again had to go to second floor to go to the front, so I walked. There was some secretaries running out and some officers running back and forth. \u201cHeil Hitler, Heil Hitler, Junge.\u201d\u2019 Wie geht\u2019s.\u201d>\u201d I walked out. Said, \u201cAuf wiedersehen,\u201d\u201d\u201d to those nice, two, big son of a so and so in the front. Walked out to the corner, walked beyond \u2014 about a block away, the boys are waiting with the car, they grabbed me, we ran away. I was so mad at myself. I wet my \u201d Hitler youth (German); Nazi youth organization. *! Hail Hitler (German) * How are you then, young man? (German) * Very good (German) \u201c How are you then, Mr. Colonel? (German) \u00a9 T wish to spoke [sic] with your officer. (German) *\u00b0 Continue (German) *\u201d Young man (German) *S How are you? (German) \u201d Good-bye (German) pants. My pants were wet, my socks were wet, my shoes were squelching. I must have been afraid. And strange enough, I was in tougher places. I was being shot at, I was being hit, I was being mutilated, practically, but this must have been scary time that I had had. Was first and the last time that I wetted my pants. That night we came in and the commander came with us. B. Dab came with us. He said, \u201cYou know where everything is, SO you go in.\u201d So I went with my big rucksack. And then we came with a ladder, we\u2019re going to climb to that window there. End of Tape #4 Tape #5"

And the Germans had the Mongolians, from outer Mongolia, who volunteered to serve the Germans. They placed them along the railroad tracks to guard it. So, when we wanted to blow up a train, we just go for about two or three kilometers and collect bunch of those people and invite them to a party. Course they had to come if they wanted or not.

Occa-occasionally some of us would go for a short visit, but very seldom because Germans had also quite good Intelligence. And they had a lot of local people who were reporting to them. So you had to be careful where you go, when you go. Like, for instance, I don\u2019t know if I was that religious, but frequently on Sunday I would sneak into the church, to my pastor. And he was friend of mine, I read all his books. I read all the books in the public library and school library and I discovered he had a big library, so I read all of his books and I served Mass. Oh my God, I served Mass forever, I was 19 and 20, I still served Mass. So he would say, \u201cOh Stefan, come on, serve the Mass.\u201d \u2018Father, I can\u2019t. I messed up last night, I blew up a train. There were people on that train \u2014,\u201d or else I did something. \u201cCome on, I\u2019Il listen to your confe\u2014 I'll hear your confession.

And if you did kill some soldiers on the train, some officers, this is a war.\u201d Anyways, I still occasionally spend sleepless night. So, it lasted \u2014 1t was good when it lasted. And then in spring, early spring of 1944, I was caught in a lapanka. Lapanka is a round-up, like they caught slaves in Africa, like they go hunting and have a \u2014 surround meters and hunters. In Poland, the lapanka was an institution. The group of German Schutzpolizei\u00b0' would stop a train or a bus, mostly train, get everybody out, fish out all \u00bb\u00b0 Priest (Polish) >! Conventional police (German) the young people, put them in trucks, take them to process, processing, transit, camp building. And in our district, was the Skaryszewska, it was an \u2014 name after the \u2014 after the street in Warsaw, \u201cSkaryszewska\u201d \u2014 processed you and sent you to compulsory labor in Germany.

It was \u2014 I was a little boy, caught on a train traveling between Warsaw and \u2014 and whatever. And of course I was sent to western part \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, eastern part of Germany, Silesia. Then there was almost like a \u2014 like a slave market. They took us to that Kreuzburg town, small town like a county town, Kreuzburg. We were kept \u2014 put in a \u2014 1n a building next to a square \u2014 there we be walked out to the square and then farmers and people from different little factories, shops and so on, would come. \u201cI\u2019ll take this one, I\u2019ll take that one, I\u2019ll take that one.\u201d \u201cOkay. Here\u2019s your ai\u2014,\u201d they filled out an arbeitbuch,\u201d a little work book for you \u2014 your name and your employers name and you went and you were servant to that person. If you got to be on a farm, it wasn\u2019t too bad, because you had enough to eat. A group of us \u2014 the group of us, about 25 boys and 23 girls, between like 13 and 19 or so, were put in a village called Schorka and we worked in a forest, natching out the trees, pine trees and collecting the resin. Resin was used by German industry for making synthetic rubber. So we worked there about eight hours a day, worked in a group with a supervisor. And sometime the Stadtpolizei?\u2019 worked with us, they try and they did not. So, some of us would be escaping now and then, of course, they would be apprehended and brought back and so on and so forth. And I worked there for, oh, probably three or four weeks. So a small group of us took off and went away. So, \u201cI would \u2014 won\u2019t work for the damn Germans here. Let us go home.\u201d And the home was a general government the center of Poland, which was so called \u201cFree Poland,\u201d it was under \u2014 it was a protectorate, Hans Frank was the gover-governor and it was run by the Germans, for the Germans, by the Germans and the Poles who were there had to give everything that they produced, they raised on the farm and so on, to the German war effort. But you were kind of semi-free. Anyway, those of us who were in the underground were free because we could go anyplace we want to."

Then they would pour a pile of water on me, I would come back to it and they gave me \u2014 and beat me again. So then he asked questions and I apparently didn\u2019t tell him very much, so he said, \u201cOkay, take him in a swing.\u201d So they took my clothes off, they tied my hands on and \u2014 my hands like this, put a broomstick here, put it on the top of the stools and I was swinging back and forth. And one of them was swinging hose, rubber hose, hitting my behind. \u201cAnd talk and tell me this and tell me that. Well, you know about si\u2014 something about this?\u201d So I was prepared, I told him blue streak. I told him \u2014 oh, I told him tall stories. All the people, all the names, who were dead. So then he left me \u2014 left me alone and he went and checked and he came back. He said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me a thing.\u201d So they gave me beating again and beating again and beating again. And then he said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s enough, we are ready.\u201d So I had a \u2014 and normally, I mean, they just took out \u2014 they shoot you. They shoot everybody in the neighborhood and this case, they wanted to be so legalistic, they wanted to be so exact, that I had a case in court. I had a defense attorney, ~\u201d We has [sic] the snake (German) \u00b0\u00b0 Snake (German) Mr. Heinrich Schmidt. Yeah, Heinrich Schmidt. And he was telling \u2014 he was talk to the court \u2014 it was the Volksgericht.\u00b0' People who did not have any training in law, appointed by the German authorities to deal punishment sentences. So, my attorney was asking for three death sentences. And the \u2014 I don\u2019t remember \u2014 or did \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I ever knew the name of the judge. He said, \u201cTwo, enough. Zwei ganz genug. Zwei ganz genug.\u00b0\u201d So he gave me two death sentences. And then he stamped \u201cN and N\u201d on my document. \u201cN and N\u201d is, is \u201cNacht und Nebel.\u00ae\u201d \u201cNight and fog.\u201d A person who got a sentence \u2014 who even did not get a sentence, but had an N and N on his documents, he was sent to concentration camp, he was finished off \u2014 taken to the gas chamber or given an injection \u2014 phenol injection. Or went to the bunker to starve to death, or got mutilated or got hung in a \u2014 in a camp square. His documents were destroyed. His ashes were \u2014 his family was not notified to send seven marks for the ashes. You disappeared just like in a night and fog. So I was the Nacht und Nebel baby. I stayed in prison, in Lubliniec for two, three weeks. I healed. I could sleep on my back. When I got there, I could sleep only on my stomach. There were 17 of us in a two person cell. We slept like sardines 1n a can on the floor. And the one who was the latest, had to sleep next to kiibel. And kiibel was a garbage pail that everybody emptied themselves. So I slept next to the ktbel for about a week. And of course I advanced, later on. But after about two or three nights, they looked at me, at my back and they said, \u201cWell, maybe you should move little here. Maybe we can put you in that corner, there,\u201d \u2018cause I, \u201cyou don\u2019t look so great.\u201d"

So I never prayed for something, not even for release, not even for a longer life. I knew I wouldn\u2019t live to be 20.

Anyway, after the sentence, I stayed there in a prison for a short time, then I went on a transport to Gross-Rosen concentration camp, which is in western Poland presently. At that time it was in eastern East Germany, close to Opole, German Oppeln. I was there in transit, in the block number 12, which was a subterranean block. It was a time \u2014 it was just a time when Polish Prince Radziwill\u201d was sent to Gross-Rosen. The Germans wanted him to from Polish government under German auspices and he refused. So they sent him to concentration camp. He was a brother-in-law of Mrs. Kennedy. Kennedy\u2019s \u2014 Mrs. Kennedy\u2019s sister married one of the \u2014 his \u2014 that Polish Prince Radziwill, who was in Great Britain then. Anyway, Prince Radziwill came with a servant.

So his Kapo told him, \u201cPrince, I\u2019m going to kill you, over the next week or two, so if you want to jump, go ahead.\u201d So he jumped."

Killing prisoners right and left, to survive. When I first came, we got into that barrack, we were put three people to the bunk and a bunk was about two and a half foot wide. Three people to a bunk and bunks were three piles high. So I went in the corner between the bunk and I stood against the wall, because my back, my seat, my \u2014 was kind of awful. And the Blockaltester was a young Warsaw boy who became a killer to survive.

Barracks zwei und zwanzig\u2019\u2019 \u2014 the first quarantine. There was a main camp and a first quarantine. First quarantine they had barracks 21, 22, 23. After that there was a wall, there was 24 and 25, but those were the bunker barracks, where people went, never to get out. Anyway, barrack 22 was the barrack of the people with \u201cN and N.\u201d So we went to a little chamber where they gave shots, phenol, derivative of gasoline. It is the most horrible death you can ever have. You die for about 45 minutes. That courses through your veins, gets into your heart several times, and you just die in a horrible torment. Just the worse thing ever. I saw dead people who died that way. They looked like the gargoyles on Notre-Dame Cathedral. Or they went on a transport, or went to Gusen Zwei,\u2019' never to come out. Or they went to gas chamber, or they went on special transport behind the front line. If something happened behind the front line, in a town or village, they would hang 10, 15, 20 local hostages and let them hang there for \u2014 sometime for weeks. If they did not have local people, they would bring people from concentration camp and execute them there. But for some strange reason, after a very short time, I was whisked out, my number was read, I was put by the gate with 500 people. We marched again to the train depot, which was about like three, four kilometers, through the little town of Mauthausen. Put on a train and went to Vienna.

So he gave me a bundle of jewelry. He said, \u201cIf you go on a trip, maybe you can buy your way out.\u201d And he gave me a Polish marine knife. So I tucked it in. We\u2019re standing there and pretty soon, SS squad came and we hiked to that depot, about three kilometers to the train and they put us in a prison compartments \u2014 went on a trip. And on the train, there was one SS man who was coming back and forth \u2014 coming back and forth, looking. And he came to a window, I, \u201cHerr, Herr Ober\u2014 Ober\u2014 Herr Oberst, can you tell me where we are going?\u201d And he looked, he said, \u201cWhat is u \u2014 what is worth to you?\u201d I said, \u201cTwo carats?\u201d \u201cGanz gut. Hand it over.\u201d So I gave him a ring with a big diamond. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cLa himmel, la himmel.*\u2019\u201d \u201cTo paradise.\u201d He said, \u201cThere\u2019s a little town east of Oppeln \u2014 of Opole. Something happened behind the front line, they don\u2019t have local hostages, so you people are it. So you \u2014 normally, you know, they took you there, they took you finery off, they put \u2014 put on you paper suits. They filled your mouth with a \u2014 with gypsum, so you couldn\u2019t yell, took you out and hanged you in a marketplace. So that was it. Said, \u201cOh gosh, now I got to watch. I have that knife, I have all the jewelry.\u201d Nothing do it \u2014 doing. Went to Vienna, they backed up prison van to the train and two people with truncheons and two people with machine guns \u2014 into, into it, they drove into \u2014 us to the Elizabethpromenade \u2014 huge prison, put us in a cell. Next morning, likewise. Put us in a train. We went through Budejovice, we went as far as Brno in Czechoslovakia. They put us in old Franciscan monastery that was made into prison. The walls, they were 12 foot thick walls. That was a fortress. But I see, in quite a big cell, \u2019\u00ae Great gate (German) \u201d Personal effects chamber (German); warehouse for confiscated belongings of prisoners. *\u00b0 Canada commando (German); term used to refer to commando of prisoners assigned to work in the camp\u2019s warehouse of looted goods. *' Heaven (German) there were 12 of us and there were another 15 of others. Anyway, there were girls next door. So we made a hole in that \u2014 well, 1t wasn\u2019t just the big, it was like a plaster wall, so we made a hole and I laid whole night talking to girls. Bunch of Czech, pretty Czech girls. They send me a paper, they send me a piece of candy and we talk blue streak all night. And the next night and the next night and those people who are with me, those prisoners who are with me said, \u201cMy gosh\u201d \u2014 those were Bibelforscher*\u2019 people, those were Baptist people. And he said, \u201cWe are supposed to be freed when we get to \u2014 to Opole, we\u2019re supposed to be freed.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, count your blessings, if you get freed, you'll get freed.\u201d Anyway, the fourth day, we\u2019re put on a train, say goodbye to the pretty girls across the street \u2014 across the wall \u2014 put us in a train. And we keep watching and I see the same views. We were going through Vienna and going west again. We got back to Mauthausen. The place \u2014 later on discovered the place where I was supposed to be disposed of \u2014 was overran by the Reds. The Soviet army was there already. And Germans being so indit\u2014 I mean outrigh\u2014 Langsam aber Sicher,\u201d slow and great and just exactly that way, no other way \u2014 took us back to the concentration camp. We came back with a group \u2014 big group of prisoners from prisons in Vienna and elsewhere, probably two or three, 400 of us. There were tables ready, the registering tables. All the blockschrei\u2014blockschreibers\u2122 were there, including my block secretary standing \u2014 sitting there at tables, you know they write your data, take your document if you have any and give you a number, give you a bracelet with your number and tell you where to go. So he was sitting there, he, \u201cStefan, come on, come on, come on here.\u201d So I went and I said, \u201cBuywid.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, welcome again. Great you made it \u2014 great you made it.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you mean great you made it? I was supposed to be freed.\u201d He said, \u201cYeah, you were going to himmel.\u201d And there was a priest, Father Iwansk1. Before I left, he listened to my confession, he gave me absolution and he said, \u201cYou are be freed, with the next three or four days, you\u2019ll be free. And pray for us.\u201d So I ca \u2014 later on I talked to Father Iwanski, I said, \u201cYou son of a gun, what do you think it was? Didn\u2019t you know I was going to by hung?\u201d \u201cWell, you know, I wanted to cheer you up. But I gave you absolution, so you will go straight to paradise.\u201d So I, \u201cI probably will go to the deepest hell, what I \u2014 for all what I did so far.\u201d Anyway, Mr. Buywid, \u201cHere\u2019s your number, here\u2019s your bracelet, go to the showers and go to the barrack. You got \u2014 you got barrack 22, you\u2019re going to my block.\u201d And I looked and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want this damn number, this a zugang numbers, this is a new prisoner number. I want my number. I am a prominente.*\u00b0\u201d By that time I was a prominent prisoner. If you survive six months, you become prominent prisoner. And out of those 600 that I came with, in six months there were 13 of us left, only. So by \u2014 by the time \u2014 when you became prominente, you have ** Biblical scholar (German); term used to refer to Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. \u00b0\u00b0 Slow but sure (German) ** Block clerk (German) *\u00b0 Prominent (German); term used in concentration camps for privileged prisoners. special consideration. You can even go to SS kitchen after the SS finish and get a dish of their own soup, with beans and pork in it."

He just died about a year ago, he was in his upper 90\u2019s. He was a great man, he was a psychoanalyst. If you ever see a little book called my \u2014 Man\u2019s Search for Meaning, it was translated into English, many of his books were translated, he was a psychoanalyst. And he \u2014 when he came to Mauthausen, I don\u2019t know if \u2014 1f he came from Auschwitz or elsewhere, he was just on his last leg. He lost his spoon, he lost his dish and with those two, you were dead. But he had a big bundle of papers. And we met, he somehow plopped next to me and \u2014 and he said, \u201cNu, who are you?\u201d \u201cOh, I am Polish.\u201d \u201cOh, I am Jew from Vienna. And what do you do in your life?\u201d I said, \u201cI did nothing, I was a student and I was doing some little work after that \u2014 before the Germans caught me. What did you do?\u201d \u201cWell, I was a doctor and I\u2019m a doctor of psychology.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhere\u2019s your spoon?\u201d \u201cOh, I lost it.\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s your dish?\u201d \u201cOh, I lost it.\u201d I said, \u201cMan, you dead, because you won\u2019t get your soup, you won\u2019t get anything to eat with.\u201d And if you try to catch some \u2014 some servers would give it into your hat, but most of them wouldn\u2019t. They would just take you aside and kill you. Anyway, found him soup spoon and found him dish and we became friends. And he was great. For next few days we just talked and every time we felt bad, 1t was just \u2014 end was coming, you know, people are being taken to gas chamber and places. He\u2019s a \u2014 he said, \u201cOh, sit down here, let\u2019s talk.\u201d So we talk blue streak and we got cheered up. He developed a\u2014a special kind of psychotherapy call \u2014 called logotherapy. And he\u2019s went talking on \u2014 on \u2014 talking tours through United States many times. One time he came in 1970\u2019s, late 70\u2019s and we couldn\u2019t get together, but I phoned him at Coffman Union at the University here and he called me back at work and then he talk \u2014 we \u2014 he phoned at night and we talked for about three hours, from about 12 until 3:30. Said, \u201cWell, I got to go, my train is \u2014 my plane is leaving shortly.\u201d So we said, \u201cAuf wiedersehen\u201d and then \u2014 anyway, he survived, but when \u2014 I never thought he would make it, but he did. He stayed in Mauthausen to the very \u2014 time of liberation. But, my case, again, I was fished out after a few \u2014 in a few days after the great crowds came and I was transported to Gusen Zwei, which was a walking distance. Gusen Eins ~ was about two mi- two kilometers, Gusen Zwei was about five kilometers, so we walked. There were about 5,000 of us walked that day. We were gather at the nightfall. We were \u2014 our clothes was taken, only belt and shoes were left on us. Our clothes was taken to be disinfected. We went to showers, which were cold at that time. We were put outside and we stayed until about four a.m. I was still quite nimble and quite healthy. I got in the middle of a group. My head kind of froze, but at morning we found about 500 people who were dead, out of 5,000. This is only 10 percent."

Every week 5,000 prisoners came, sometime 10,000. And it never went above 50. Never went about 40. In a week would be 40. About \u2014 attrition ration was about 20 percent a week. Was a horrible work, we worked digging tunnels under mountain. The tunnels were buil\u2014 dug especially to put armament industries in them. They already built tanks. They built Messerschmitt \u2014 Messerschmitt planes. And I think they built also rocket planes that they used \u2014 I mean, the Vau-Eins,\u201d> Vau-Eins, Vau-Zwei,\u201d to bomb England. But I\u2019m not sure of that. But I knew they built Messerschmitts. But I was on a crew that was digging the tunnel, digging with a \u2014 straight ahead of you, in a kind of a softish stone, with a air drill. And a person as strong as he is, or he is, could stand about four days. After four days you broke down. Well, I stood it for about seven days and I was given a shovel to shovel because I couldn\u2019t lift 1t any more. And I had a Yugoslavian friend \u2014 Janko \u2014 Janko, I can\u2019t remember his last name. He lasted 27 days drilling. The drill weighed probably 35 - 40, maybe 50 pounds, straight into the wall, drilling. Then he dropped dead. Just dropped the drill and dropped. By the time we turn him over, he was dead. Yeah, he was a \u2014 Yugoslavians and especially Albanian. Albanian people are the tough son of a guns. Albanian man can swear for 15 minutes and never repeat himself.

So one time, I got the sh\u2014- German Shepherd in a dark tunnel and of course I dispose of him, I skinned him. I had him baked in a ba\u2014 in the smithy, because I that time was \u2014 I was a \u2014 a Laufer, \u2019 I was a runner. I was running with the drills to the smithy and back, you know, carrying them back and forth to be sharpened and to be brought back. So I gave the smith one-fourth of a dog, he baked it for me. Then I shared another quarter with the people who worked with me and a half of the dog, I brought to the camp and that three or four of us lived high on the dog for about a week and a half. Oh, that was an enormous shot in the arm. Course my Russian friend liked the dog so much, he said, \u201cStepka, get another one. Get another one.\u201d I said, \u201cSorry, I cannot catch and old German Shepherd, this was a young, stupid German Shepherd.\u201d"

            "answer": "We had a gas chamber, but I \u2014 no, there was a gas chamber in Gusen One, but not Gusen Zwei. But the mortality ratio was so enormous that \u2014 that nothing else was necessary. Of course the Kapos killed their portion of people every day. We went to camp, I mean went to work \u2014 on the way home we carried five, six, 10 - 15 - 20 people out of a hundred. Carried them because they were killed at the job. Some dropped dead but most of them \u201d\u00bb Crook from Rostov (Russian) *\u00b0 | walked in pockets (Russian) *7 Runner (German) were killed by the Kapo. Kapo would get a cigarette for every person he killed. If he were a heavy smoker, he killed a lot of people. Also, there was a Krankenhaus, there was a hospital and if you went to Krankenhaus, never came back, of course \u2014 but some people did. So from time to time, they would have a \u2014 a Krankenhaus had to be disinfected. So they would take the people from a Krankenhaus and make them walk across the railroad tracks to another barrack that was empty, kind of a temporary Krankenhaus and keep them there, and there would be a line of Kapos lined up on each side of the group walking. Anybody who would walk, they ran a gauntlet. They had ax handles on \u2014 or two by fours, and anybody who did not run, was killed. So I remember once in the first of February, 1945, they killed that night, 400 sick people out of 700, about 300 only made it, could run. The rest were killed. I had a friend at that time, he was a Polish mountaineer. He was a tough son of a \u2014 he was just wiry, he was strong. He was everything. Anyway, he got sick or he \u2014 maybe he malinger. So he was sent to the hospital. He went to hospital, couple nights later comes a Kapo from a hospital and say \u2014 calls my number, so I answer him, and said, \u201cYou have a friend in the hospital.\u201d \u201cYes, I have a friend in the hospital.\u201d \u201cHis \u2014 his name is Janko the Goral,\u201d* \u201cJohn \u2014 little Johnny, the mountaineer.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthat window, so he wants you to come and see him at that window.\u201d So at night I sneaked in \u2014 that was not allowed. To get out of a barrack, going get killed. So I went and I knocked the window, he opened it up and, \u201cOh, Stefan, come tomorrow and bring me a big jug of water. I\u2019m so thirsty, there\u2019s not enough water here. Here.\u201d So he gave me a little bundle. I came back, there were about seven portions of bread. It was a fortune. Eating an extra portion a day, keep you alive and up your spirit for at least a week, maybe 14 days. So I brought him some water next day and I said, \u201cJanko, where did you get all that bread?\u201d \u201cWell, you know, those damn Muselmans \u2019.\u201d Muselmans was a name for people who were on their last foot. You know, they just lay there, they can\u2019t eat, they hold their bread. So when the Fliegeralarm'\u2019\u2019 comes, you know, night, when the lights are out and planes are flying \u2014 lights are all \u2014 all the lights are off, he just went from bed to bed and swiped the bread and lived high on the hog. And I said, \u201cJanko, but this is un-Christian.\u201d \u201cThey are going to die anyway. I\u2019m not going to \u2014I\u2014I\u2019m not killing them, but they can\u2019t eat. They have bunches of bread sitting there, they just can\u2019t eat.\u201d So we both \u2014 and all my friends in the barrack, lived high on the hog. And Janko came back, got out of a ba\u2014 of a hospital, came back to the barrack and he was given three days of convalescence. He was staying in the barrack, did not have to go to work. And the Kapo, day Kapo in the barrack, ask him to do something and Janko said, \u201cYou so and so, get away from me. I\u2019m convalescing, I\u2019m sick.\u201d So the man *\u00ae Mountaineer, uplander (Polish) *\u201d Muslim (German); camp term used to refer to prisoners who had lost the will to live and were near death. '\u00b0 Aid-raid alarm (German) took his tool and beat Janko to death. I came at night and one of our friends said, \u201cYour friend is there.\u201d There was a \u2014 you know, there was a big, high stone wall between each barrack and next barrack. And we lined up, you know laid down, it was 10 - 20 - 50 people a day who were dying. So I went. Yes, Janko was still there, laying, his head bashed in. So I did have his address. I wrote to his family after the war and his sister answered and she said, \u201cWell, my mother feels so bad because Janko was taken because he argued with her, so he volunteered and went to work in Germany and he got himself charge with sabotage and sent to concentration camp. And please tell me, did he have a nice casket? How was he buried, did he have a priest?\u201d Janko, with probably 500 others, next day, was dumped into big wagon, that about 50 prisoners pushed and pulled. They just had big sides and their wheels were just like the Conestoga wagons in America there, but bigger. And they pushed and pulled to the first Gusen Eins, where the crematortum was. Gusen Zwei did not have a crematorium, so that the bodies, probably four or 500 a day, sometime maybe 1,000 a day were wheeled to Gusen Eins to be cremated."

And he walked out into the front '? Mr. Bujwid '? Fall in for execution (German) and they got lined up and the Blockaltester, Max, the German criminal who was the block leader, led them out.... And it was so, so funny, Mr. Bujwid talked with that little Henry. Oh, they talk blue streak. \u201cBecause we both are from the holy Zmudz.\u201d Because the little boy was from the same territory that Mr. Buywid was. They say, \u201cWe\u2019re holy people, we believe in God, we hate the damn Communists. We hate those Germans even more because they\u2019re ungodly creatures. And we are going to survive for ever and ever and ever.\u201d And the last day, before Henry went to be killed, he said, \u201cMr. Bujwid, thank you.\u201d Yeah, he, he knew what was coming. Anyway, that was still in Mauthausen and that was I wa\u2014 then I wa\u2014 on our way in \u2014 Gusen Zwei and of course, it \u2014 I heard it later on, but it was a good story. A Swedish Red Cross person, whose name nobody ever found, came to speak to the commander, General Pohl,'** P-o-h-I. And he came to talk to him and General Pohl was complaining, he said, \u201cSee here,\u201d was a telegram or was a letter. \u201cI have an befehl'\u00b0 here,\u201d I have an order, \u201cto lead all these people I have left here, about 42,000, into the tunnel. The ends of the tunnels are already mined to be dynamited and those people will suffocate there, within in probably one, two hours.\u201d He said, \u201cIf it was only telephone order, I probably could escape not doing it, but is a befehl, it\u2019s a telegram, I had to sign for it. What I am going to do?\u201d He was not \u2014 he was not a very bad person, that man was. Matter of fact, he had a case in court later on and some of us testified for him. Anyway, when this man left his office, the document disappeared. The man \u2014 and the general was diverted somewhat \u2014 the man swiped it. He borrowed a bicycle from a German guard, then he borrowed a horse. And the American front line was just beyond Linz. It was probably 30 - 35 - 40 miles. He went across the whole front line on a horse, then \u2014 he in tie and suit. Why the German Ges-\u2014 SS didn\u2019t kill him, I don\u2019t have an idea. Did he talked to somebody, I don\u2019t have an idea. Did he identify himself, I don\u2019t have an idea. He got across, he got as far as General Patton'\u201d\u00b0 headquarters. And nobody wanted to talk to him, so he bothered everybody there and eventually somebody did talk to him. So he mentioned that, he described it. So they said, \u201cOkay, come on in, come on in.\u201d They let him talk to assistant to Patton. And then Patton came and asked a few questions. And Patton sent five American tanks. They broke across the front line, they went and went and went. They came to Gusen Zwei, they took few potshots at the guard towers. The SS people surrendered. They left tank, I think about five soldiers, to guard those 800 SS, who are herded into \u2014 into \u2014 into a big kind of a barn. And the rest of us, who were just barely moving, because we haven\u2019t gotten anything to eat about four days and my case, I was flat on my back. I couldn\u2019t even turn over. Then the four tanks went to Mauthausen, five more miles and sur\u2014 and get around, too few \u2014 took few potshots at the guard towers.

She would jab and jab and jab and she could not find a vein. She said, \u201cJust don\u2019t look when I come. I don\u2019t want you to see, because your veins disappear.\u201d My both arms were just like \u2014 like I was a heavy addict to God knows what. But it didn\u2019t dry it. It didn\u2019t dry, they had to make a puncture in the back and pump it out. And they couldn\u2019t put me under, because I would never wake up. So two big men, just like those two, big clunks held me and the doctor went back and he made \u2014 punctured my back and he pumped, oh probably gallon and a half of horrible liquid. And he said \u2014 the doctor said, \u201cWell, if you\u2019re lucky, this is it. If you\u2019re not lucky, you have to pump it every six months for the rest of your days. Of course, if are still unlucky, you die of TB, well, you\u2019ll be dead.\u201d I was lucky. I didn\u2019t die of TB and I did not have to ever have it pumped again, except that I have two big stones on the bottom of my lungs, because the calcium goes all the organism and collects in your lungs and settles on the bottom. Occasionally when I have '\u00b08 Come there [sic] (German) ' Yes, we help you, we help you. (German) '!\u00ae Municipal hospital (German) cold, when I cough, little grainy stuff, I do cough out.

But I am becoming the prosecutor general of the Polish armed forces and I cannot write you to \u2014 to you any more. But I promise you that \u2014 your folder, that is about three inches thick, is going to disappear when I get my position. Nobody\u2019s going to see it again.\u201d And my sisters, when they came \u2014 they came here, said, \u201cYes, he came for a visit, many times,\u201d and the times were hard in Poland, so sh\u2014 they said that he brought always some very exquisite food. He always brought a bottle of champagne and \u2014 with a lunch with him and he said, \u201cI never will forget what you did for me.\u201d He said, \u201cWhen I was a kid, and we were dirt poor, when Stefan and I were going to school in the morning, I would sneaked into your house early and your mother always would give me a good breakfast with Stefan. And then we walked our three kilometers to school.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019Il never forget that.

They don\u2019t know who Hitler was. They heard little of Stalin, they don\u2019t remember who Roosevelt was. They learn little '!? The places and times of terror should never be forgotten.

They were just about few pages gone and they wanted to ask many questions and I told them little story. So I frequently go and talk to group \u2014 various groups of people, willingly, and few of us that are still alive should not forget. And it seems like your people with the museum there and whatever information you impart to people must have some influence, because a lot of schools, even grade schools, have a special course every year on the Holocaust. And as far as I know, almost all the middle schools here, especially the religious schools, Catholic and Lutheran schools, do have it too."

            "answer": "Yes. But those two girls in question, they were couriers for our underground. They carried mostly explosives on the train. They\u2019d have two huge suitcases of explosives, get on the train, they spoke little German. They\u2019re pretty young girls. Well, frequently they would get into a German car \u2014 a bunch of German soldiers, officers had a special car, so they\u2019re, \u201cMadchen, madchen, kommen Sie hier.'*!\u201d So they would came with the big suitcase that the German would pick up the suitcase, put it up on the upper. Because there were controls frequently, they would stop a train and search and contraband like food, the '\u00b0 Sandy hill (Polish); colloquially \u201ccemetary.\u201d '*! Girls, girls, come here! (German) so-called black market, which was a free market, people training would be stole \u2014 taken away from people. So if you are pretty girl and you carry that, Germans invited you, took your bundle there and nobody could come and search you. And they would come to Warsaw and said, \u201cauf wiedersehen\u201d and \u201cdanke schon\u201d and went blissfully their own way with four big suitcases, carrying enough stuff to blow up four \u2014 four or five trains. But the Communists got them. They said, \u201cBut we helped you.\u201d \u201cWell, helpers like you we don\u2019t need any more.\u201d Just like with my four boys. \u201cHelpers like you we don\u2019t need any more.\u201d And mainly, we were helpers in one aspect. In 1943, in summer, a Communist young man, slightly older than I, came and talk \u2014 talked. He said, \u201cStefan, we need to blow up something and I know that you can do it.\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019re a dirty Communist. I wouldn\u2019t bend my finger to do anything for you.\u201d \u201cBut you know, you really got to help us. You really got to help us.\u201d So I talked to my commander and my commander said, \u201cOh, you stupid so and so. Go help them? If you go and lose your behind, it will serve you well because you lost your head already.\u201d But he reconsidered. Few days later he came and said, \u201cYes, you can go and help them. I talked \u2014 we talked.\u201d So they provided me with two \u2014 well, they gave me two of my boys and myself and a load of explosives. And provided us with a German chauffeur. German chauffeur who was carrying a truckload of arm \u2014 war material to a certain spot. And we\u2019re going to that spot. It was kind of an army filled depot. There were a lot of explosives there and then tanks and aircraft bombs and God knows what else. So he left us out in the forest. He went and delivered the stuff and then came back and he was going to wait for us in the forest. And I was told, \u201cYou send one boy, if he doesn\u2019t make it, send a second one. Don\u2019t go yourself, because if you go, you get court martialed when you get back.\u201d So one of my boys went in, he went under the first wire and had a little shovel, dug out. Then he went to a second wire and a dog got him. And the guards, the SS guards came in and shot him. And well, he didn\u2019t suffer because they shot what he had with him and he just gro\u2014 got blown up to smithereens. So then I said, \u201cWell, your turn.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going.\u201d I said, \u201cBut you have to, you swore.\u201d \u201cYou can shoot me, I\u2019m not going. I\u2019m not going to help those son of a bitches against those son of a bitches.\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, you don\u2019t have much choice, do we? I have to shoot you.\u201d \u201cWell, go ahead and shoot me. You\u2019re my friend. I would rather be \u2014 be shot by a friend than \u2014 then relative.\u201d So I said, \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to try, but be sure when we come back, don\u2019t you ever tell.\u201d Said, \u201cDll save my life, I won\u2019t tell.\u201d So I went \u2014 I went to the first place, I went to a second place, there was still stuff around. It was muddy also, but was quite muddy from the person who blew up. And a dog came and for quite sometime \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I had \u2014 it\u2019s like I had affinity with dogs. Actually when we walked \u2014 my group walked to the village and I was with them, not a single dog would bark. And a bunch of dogs would fo\u2014 I would go \u2014 walk behind and a bunch of dogs would follow me and squeal \u2014 wanted to be petted. So the dog came and he squealed and I petted him and he raised his \u2014 his \u2014 his leg and sprayed me from head to toe. I was so mad at that dog. I said, \u201cIf that was elsewhere, I would show you what 1s what.\u201d And the guards came by and the dog followed them and I was right at their feet there. They never looked. So I scrambled in \u2014 I walked in. I had \u2014 I always ruled by 17, I had \u2014 my lucky 17. So I went for my 17 charges, put them here and there. Then I got out the same way, I watched the guards when they just passed. I got from \u2014 was a kind of a half truck standing nearby, got from behind it. Scrambled under one wire and a second wire and ran like hell. Got to my boy, grabbed him and we both ran like hell. We got to the forest. Probably was a good kilometer, was like three-fourths of a mile. He started the truck, we drove. We drove like hell for about 10 - 15 minutes and it blew up. The first explosion blew up all the windows in the truck, back and front. And then it blew and it blew and it blew and it blew. It was just like an atomic f \u2014bomb fireworks. They were preparing pa \u2014 putsch on Moscow and the Russians \u2014 and the Russian under \u2014 Soviet underground wanted badly to demolish this. So that\u2019s why my boys, after the war were invited to the big party. \u201cYou did for us, you did for us, but now we don\u2019t need you any more. Also, people like you we don\u2019t need here. Out you go.\u201d And they asked about me and they said, \u201cThe Germans got him, probably killed him.\u201d"

Presently I have them very seldom. I probably will have one next couple nights. When I saw Schindler\u2019s List \u2014 after I saw Schindler\u2019s List, | had a couple real \u2014 just almost like \u2014 like it really happened there and I was there back \u2014 back there. But it is so far away. One time, St. Paul Cathedral was showing a film, Nacht'** \u2014 Night and Fog. The film still exists. It was made by the Polish French company and you can still get the video of it. Anyway, I was asked to come and watch with them and to talk about it later on. Well, it was shortly after I came here and after that went \u2014 that went through, I could not talk, mainly because I saw the steps. Hundred and eighty-six steps from a stone quarry, leading to the camp in Mauthausen. And I walked those steps for 11 days, carrying a big stone. When you first came into Mauthausen, you went through the introduction, you were put in a Strafkommando, punishment company. You went down to the quarry and you went up, you went down. Oh, it was about six, seven times a day and you took the biggest stone you could carry, because if you didn\u2019t, when you got to about 100 steps up, the Kapo would look and said, \u201cHey you and you and you and you, step out there. You stupid so and so. Look at the rest of them, they are just breaking down, getting ruptures. And you took two those little stones?\u201d So he give them a push and they would fly down. And that happened just about every day. Five, 10 - 15 -20 people would be killed a day, in the Strafkommando. And sometime, when he had a special order, they would make people run. It was Fliegerbriicke,'\u201d the flying bridge. There was a kind of a little platform and he would run people to the platform and they would fly down, like two or 300 feet. And then the quarry supervisor started complaining that they messed \u2014 \u201cHe is messing up my work, so make him stop. That so and so is '** Night (German) '\u00b0 Flyer\u2019s bridge (German) messing up my work. He had all those \u2014 those \u2014 all that mess, those smashed prisoners there. I have to clean it up every day.\u201d So it kind of abated, but he was still killing people. If he didn\u2019t do that, when you \u2014 didn\u2019t like you or you got close up and the upper was kind of a steep road into the gate, front gate of the Grosse Tor \u2014 he would take your hat, we had those stripped berets \u2014 he would take it and make it fly beyond the post line. And you had to put your stone down, everybody waited and you went to retrieve it. And that was a no-no, because it was beyond the line, and people up on the tower there would open up and shoot you.

And you had to go and retrieve your hat because if you walked to the gate, you had to take your hat and walk at attention, you know, your hat to your leg and walk stiffly and carry your big stone here, you know. Straighten up. SS at the gate, if you did not have a hat to take off, they would take you \u2014 take you aside and beat you \u2014 most of the time they would take you aside and shoot you. There would be pile of people, dead bodies on the side, people who did not have their hats with them. Those little exercises. I made it for 11 days and lived to tell.

People who stay in places who don\u2019t have to work, they don\u2019t want to work. We talk sometime about our welfare people, they\u2019re paid little and not to have to work. People who don\u2019t work, won\u2019t work. There were probably \u2014 out of five, eight, 10,000, in Wildflecken, maybe 200 of us who worked. The rest of the people didn\u2019t. And I knew one person who was a black market operator, he was a rich \u2014 one rich young man. And each person were living in a camp had to donate half a day work to the camp, like chopping trees for the fuel, sweeping streets or doing something. Well, he didn\u2019t. So he was called to the camp director and the camp director said, \u201cMr. So and So, I have a report here you haven\u2019t worked last week.\u201d And said, \u201cMr. Director, that\u2019s a lie. I never worked.\u201d \u201cYou never worked? You are supposed to work.\u201d \u201cI pay well, people who go and work for me. When my time comes, there is a person who goes and works for me hard, for half a day or a day, I pay him well. Mr. Director, that\u2019s a lie, I never worked.\u201d That was the mentality of \u2014 that people developed. Later on when they went to various countries, there were some were repatriated to Poland, but very few. When Communism took over, they did not want to, as I didn\u2019t want to. Many went to Canada, many went \u2014 many \u2014 some \u2014 everybody wanted to come to America. Some went to Belgium, some went to England. Many went to Australia and New Zealand. While those people had \u2014 at times had a hard time adjusting back and going back to work. So I stayed in Wildflecken until 1949 and the U.S. Catholic Conference found a sponsor here and I went through the consul and a doctor and document this and document that \u2014 all kind of little documents. As the Russians said, \u201cS propiskom vsy\u00e9 mozhna'\u201d\u00b0 zrobic.'*\u201d\u201d With a little card, you can do almost anything.

Well, now maybe you can, but that time you could not. So all this little documents and you had to go through a doctor and \u2014 well, I worked part time with American CIC.

By mother hands, the light shines bright, By prie\u2014 by prayer blessed, so then suddenly alive. This one and that one took flight to God, Praying and begging for plenty to all, Health of a husband and children\u2019s health. Father in a mood, not ugly, sat behind the table. Did not loose faith in good times to come, So that instead of hope in the promissory notes, For his tedious sewing, simple cash will flow. Three dishes served of yore in Jerusalem, Gefilte fish in fish sauce and a soft challah, Chicken soup with beans with angel hair macaroni, Hen \u2014 Jewish style \u2014 divided to make eight quarters of one. Sabbath is for your rest, just like good Lord ordered And with His Torah to proclaim his name. To perform ablutions and all those good deeds \u2014 Good deeds do always, not only on the Sabbath day. My Sabbath was trampled in these times of horror, When evil mark was spotted in ancestral scrutiny. Dahlias in bloom, charmed and enchanted us, Safe ha \u2014 safe harbor here I searched for in a Far Eastern way. Sabbath at times comes in dreams. The same stars are shining by, The same dahlias still bloom. And still of great old times, we daydream.\u201d That\u2019s it."
