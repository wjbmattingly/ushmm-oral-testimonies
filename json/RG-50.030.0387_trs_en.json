            "answer": "Yes, we \u0152 the farms in that part of Poland were a kind of a variety farm. The land was rather poor, so they planted just about everything that they needed and in \u0152 everything they could sell. They planted a lot of cabbage and a plenty of potatoes and some wheat and also a lot of rye. Our land was in many little pieces, so we had to travel from a village to work on, on the land. My father \u0152 just about like me \u0152 spent a lot of time in strange places. The part of Poland that we lived in before 19 \u0152 in \u0152 before 1900\u2122s, were occupied by Russia, Czarist Russia. My father was conscripted, or drew a lot and spent 12 and a half years in Czar\u2122s imperial army. He came back home for six months and the first war \u0152 world war started. He was called again and did fight on the western front against \u0152 against Germans. And of course he heard some Polish people speaking across the front lines, so he walked across one night and thought he would join them. Instead of that, they put him in a prisoners of war came \u0152 camp. And they sent him way, way out west, close to the western front line betw \u0152 a li \u0152 a front line between France and Germany. And again, well he was \u0152 at that time he was a sapper. He was a fortification specialist. So the Germans gave him a group of people, group of prisoners and they built fortifications \u0152 a kind of a front line fortification system at Verdun. And probably everybody heard of that horrible battle at Verdun, where more than half a million people were killed. So he did, and the Germans of course, were very appreciative, so he put him in a fr \u0152 one morning they put him in a front of a squad that he was in and gave him German Ritterkreuz 2 or, or Eisern\u0160Eisernekreuz3 \u0152 German, German decoration, because the part that he built there \u0152 the French could not overrun it. They tried several time, they couldn\u2122t overrun it. Anyway, a few days later, he heard Polish people speaking across the line on the French side. So he walked across. And the Po \u0152 he joined Polish Legion that was fighting on the French side. Couple nights later he led the French into the part of the fortification that he built. They overran it, they kicked the Germans out 2 Knight\u2122s Cross (German) 3 Iron Cross (German) 4 and the French gave him the Croix de Guerre 4. So he had German decoration, he had French decoration. Later on, the Polish Legion gave him Virtuti Militari, 5 Polish cross. So when my father came back home after the wars, he didn\u2122t brag much about it. As a matter of fact, my family didn\u2122t know about it. I was the only one that he showed the crosses to and he told little about what happened. When he came home, he brought some things. He brought a French army coat and he brought a pair of American army boots. And he had those boots until 1940\u2122s. They were pair of clodhoppers. They had a big, round toes, but he said, \ufb01Those are the best boots I ever had.\ufb02 They were ugly, but he said, \ufb01They are sewed, they are glued and nailed. You can never wear them out.\ufb02 Occasionally on \u0152 on a big holiday, he would put those boots on and para\u0152 shine them and parade around it. And everybody was look and said, \ufb01Jan, where do you get those ugly boots?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01You better shut up, thos e are American boots, those are the best boots I ever had.\ufb02 01:10:54"

There was quite a lively social life. There were mostly \u0152 mostly religious holidays and feasts that people took part in it. Like for instance, when the month of May came, every night after supper, everybody went to a little shrine and they would be singing lot of hymns and they would sing a litany to all the saints and then you would walk home and sing loudly.

They were tailors and shoemakers. And we traded with them throughout our lives. We always had a family or two or three that we\u2122re very friendly with and visited when we went there.

The \u0152 Warsaw was still fighting, but they went around and approached our neighborhood. There was quite a sharp firefight in my village. Started early morning \u0152 the Polish cavalry came in and some infantry came in. The cavalry dismounted and sent horses back and they dug in on the periphery of my village. They had a whole bunch of little, anti-tank artillery. Was two fat wheels, and a horse and they could pull it like the dickens. Two men could pull that little thing. It was very effective against German tanks. So they dug in and they were waiting, and of course, the Germans attacked. And it\u2122s kind of strange, my father said, \ufb01Well, why don\u2122t you take the cows to the pasture?\ufb02 And my father dug a dugout for the family, in a garden in the orchard, so they were \u0152 went all there and I took their horses and the cows to the pasture in the back \u0152 way back, beyond the village \u0152 it was a communal pasture. By the time I \u0152 I did get there, I couldn\u2122t come back because there was a \u0152 I mean, was honest to goodness firefight. It was long distance artillery German \u0152 German artillery shooting. And a \u0152 a kind of bombarding the neighborhood, there was a \u0152 more machine guns going all over, so I just stayed behind the village, there, for about two hours. In about two hours, the Poles retreated and went and then came two cavalry men, who said, \ufb01Hey, little boy, do you know that little wood across the hill, there?\ufb02 \ufb01Of course I know it.\ufb02 \ufb01We have horses 11 Armed forces (German) 15 there, about 15 horses, can you go and get the horses here?\ufb02 \ufb01Oh, sure. Why not?\ufb02 So I started running, kind of over the hill \u0152 I run over the hill and there was lot of firing and going and then I see \u0152 all of a sudden, I was kind of running on the border of a hi \u0152 of a \u0152 of a field. The border was kind of a strip of grass, it was higher than a field and I see right by my feet there, dust flying. And I didn\u2122t think \u0152 think much of it, but it was somebody shooting machine gun from a way, way distance there \u0152 German machine gun and hitting right where I was running, below my feet. It was several times, right below my feet. Apparently, whoever was shooting, was shooting little too low, thank goodness. When I ran to \u0152 I ran over the hill, the horses were gone. 02:14:34 So I laid down behind a bunch of trees, big Olszyna12 trees. There were such trees here. And artillery was shooting and hitting in \u0152 in transit was hitting a top of a trees and branches were falling down. So I just laid there for about half an hour, then it slowed down, I went back to the village, village was on fire and about two-thirds of the village was burned. There were nobody \u0152 no civilian casualties. There were about 35 Polish soldiers, who were killed. There were about 100 of Germans who were killed, back in approach the village. There were about 11 tanks that were mashed to smithereens by those little ca \u0152 Polish cannons. And of course the Poles ran away and the Germans came in. We were taking \u0152 getting water in pails, out of a \u0152 out of a well and I was \u0152 I climbed up on a top of a roof to prevent our house from being burned, because the neighbors house were burning, so I was handed the pails of water, I was pouring on the \u0152 on the roof of the house to prevent it from burning on. And the refugees who are running around the Warsaw, the bunch \u0152 were a group of people from Warsaw who were running around, \ufb01What will happen to us, what will happen to us? The Germans are going to kill us.\ufb02 Well, the German patrol came down the village and they just came, they didn\u2122t bother anybody, went across the village and went into the woods beyond the village, where the Polish army escaped. And more patrols came and more patrols came. But they were very correct, they did not bother anybody. They questioned a few men and they took document \u0152 asked for documents and they did not bother anybody. In \u0152 in other places, they would take young men and \u0152 and kill them.

            "answer": "Waked up in su\u0152 before sunrise, counting \u0152 Appell 20, counting. You got a pot of tea, which was made out of birch leaves. You got a little, tiny piece of bread, maybe half an ounce or so. You ate it. Then you dressed up and you went walking. If you remember, about four or five years ago, where there was a Olympics in Sarajevo, they showed the Russian Siberian man, who was a weightlifter and a wrestler, how he ran a mile in the snow that deep? This is the snow we walked in. It was two guards and about 50 of us and we walked. And the person who walked ahead was changed every hundred feet or so. If, for \u0152 sometime for punishment, if they made one person walk all way, a mile or two or 19 Felt boots (Polish) 20 Roll call (German). 23 three miles to the place of work. He \u0152 by the time he got there, he was dead \u0152 breaking the snow. So we went \u0152 we cut trees for about five hours, then came soup at noon. People came with sleds from a camp, with big kettles of fish and cabbage soup. It was mostly water. We sat down and ate the soup, then we cut tree \u0152 trees again and stacked them and came back. Six p.m., we started on the way home, we got there by seven or so. Were counted again, got another pot of tea and a little slice of bread and of course to sleep. We had a good guard. I mean he was a damn Soviet, but he was a good guy, the guard. I mean, he was just out of this world. When we did get there, said, \ufb01Tea. Make fire.\ufb02 So we made fire. \ufb01Make big fire. Sit and rest.\ufb02 So we sat around and rest. And he looked at his watch, he had a Polish watch that he stole during 1939 campaign, said \ufb01polsky chasy. 21\ufb02 Polish watch runs well. \ufb01Go and cut.\ufb02 So we went and cut for about, oh probably one hour. So then, \ufb01Hey, come on back.\ufb02 So we came back. \ufb01Sit and rest. Soup coming.\ufb02 Oh, in about one hour, soup came. \ufb01Eat.\ufb02 We ate. \ufb01Sit and rest.\ufb02 We sat and rest. \ufb01Go and cut.\ufb02 So went and cut for about one hour. And he \u0152 then he went \u0152 came to us there where we were. \ufb01Now, go and steal.\ufb02 So we went stealing. A prisoner had to cut a cubic yard of wood a day. And regardless how young, how strong, how big you were, you could never do it. If you didn\u2122t cut a square yard per person, your group didn\u2122t, at night your soup was cut, your bread was cut accordingly. Next day you were weaker. In a week you were gone. So we would go and steal the wood that we cut day before and day before and day before stack it up, he would measure it. \ufb01Okay, now we sit down and rest, we go home soon. Make bigger fire.\ufb02 So we went home. That Ivan Ivanovich was a damn good man. 03:11:47 Also, I was lucky. I spoke some English, I spoke some German. I spoke Russian quite well. When my father and mother wanted us kid not to know what was going on, they spoke Russian. My mother was a Russian teacher in middle school before she got married. My father was of course, Russian speaking person. So we kids learned it in a hurry. We knew exactly what was going on. On the train for six weeks, by the time we got to Siberia, my Russian was almost as good as my English. Much more colorful because I knew a lot of swear words. So they found out and I was called to the commanders office and he said, \ufb01You stay here, you translate.\ufb02 And he got the German word, \ufb01You dolmetscher. 22\ufb02 \ufb01You interpreter.\ufb02 I don\u2122t know how he got that German word, I knew what it was, but \ufb01You dolmetscher.\ufb02 When new prisoners came, I would get up on that barrel and I would shout, \ufb01His Excellency, Commander so and so says this and says that and says that. You don\u2122t do this, you don\u2122t do that. You get shot for this, you get in solitary for that. You get hunged up for this. So remember.\ufb02 And of course, after a few days, I \u0152 one time a group of Czechs came and I got up on the barrel and I became kind of \u0152 took it for granted, became rambunctious \u0152 young, stupid kid. And I said, \ufb01Commander Mika-Mikhail Ivishenerovich, that son of a dog says this and this and 21 Polish watch (Russian) 22 Interpreter (German) 24 this.\ufb02 And in Polish it\u2122s skurwysyn,23 in Russian, it\u2122s sukin-syn.24 In English, of course, you know what it is. So he came and he knocked me down and he kicked me. Said, \ufb01You little so and so, you called me sukin-syn.\ufb02 Said, \ufb01I called you Excellency, and Excellency in Polish \u0152 in Czech, and sukin-syn sounds almost close together. I call you Excellency.\ufb02 \ufb01Oh no, I know Polish and I know Czech, you call me sukin-syn. If you say that again, I\u2122ll shoot you, you little so and so.\ufb02 Said, \ufb01Commander, I did not say it, but I will not sa\u0152 ever say it again if I did.\ufb02 I thought my goose was cooked, but it wasn\u2122t. So I stayed in barrack, I peeled potatoes, I swept the barracks. I had a norm man, a man who wrote the norms for the people, what people did during the day. I helped him do the norms. The classification, how much soup at night ever ybody gets. And I learn how to cheat, how to write up \u0152 how to cheat so that people made more than they did. Anyway, I made it. 03:15:12"

They wer\u0152 they were the Samoyed people. Siberian people like American Eskimos. Samoyed people raised reindeer and fished. So I went and wandered around and a young boy came and talked to me, he said, \ufb01Who you are?\ufb02 \ufb01Kto vy takoy? 26\ufb02 So I said, \ufb01Well, I am Polish.\ufb02 And, \ufb01Chto eto takoy?27\ufb02 \ufb01What is that?\ufb02 Said, \ufb01Well, I am from a country way, way west.

Yurta is a kind of a conical tent made of bearskins, double bearskin \u0152 four out and four in. And it\u2122s kind of a good size, about the size of this living room here, about 12, 15 feet in diameter. But if you get into the yurta, if you \u0152 they use a \u0152 long handed hatchets, like American Indian tomahawks. If you pick up the hatchet and put it like this and take your hand off, the hatchet will stay there, the air is so thick. The Samoyed had people wash twice a year, if they have to or not. And they cook, they sleep, they make babies, they do everything in the yurta. I mean the smell is overpowering. But they say, \ufb01Never mind, pribyknyesh 28 \u0152 you get used to it.\ufb02 So I ate a lot of fish and the young man said, \ufb01You come tomorrow?\ufb02 \ufb01If I can, I come tomorrow.\ufb02 So he gave me some fish, I took the fish to the camp.

Khorosho, kak Vas velichat\u2122?29\ufb02 \ufb01How do we call you?\ufb02 Velichat\u2122 30, it means, you use you name, your father\u2122s name. So I said my father was Jana. \ufb01Okay, Stepka Ivanovich, come on and eat.\ufb02 So we ate. \ufb01Yi\u0152 How much time do you have?\ufb02 \ufb01Oh, some time.\ufb02 \ufb01We\u2122ll go fishing.\ufb02 So we went fishing. So they gave me \u0152 gave me harpoon and we walked, on the River Lena. And I fell in. I didn\u2122t know what was what. River Lena is a very brisk river. The ice that time was probably 20 feet thick, but there 26 Who are you such? (Russian) 27 What is that such? (Russian) 28 You get accustomed (Russian) 29 Good, what are you called? (Russian) 30 To be called by name (Russian) 26 were wash-outs, little bubbles. If you step on the bubble, you go in. I was lucky, I had the harpoon. So I fell only in \u0152 that way I got wet. It was not very cold, just about maybe 25 below zero. So two of them grabbed me and ran back \u0152 ran to the \u0152 back to the yurta where I s \u0152 I stripped. And he said, \ufb01Well, I loan you my suit.\ufb02 His suit was made of silver foxes. Big pants up to here and a big parka, with a big, huge hood \u0152 silver fox outfit, and reindeer. It was soft as silk. Because this man had three suits and he had three wives. Good Siberian women can make only one suit at a time. She has to chew the skin. Siberian wives has teeth just about three millimeters long, where they constantly chew the skin. You \u0152 you tan it and then you invert it and you chew the inside of it to make it soft, and becomes \u0152 either the chewing process or the saliva makes it as soft as silk. So I wore his suit. Went fishing again, we caught some sturgeon. They made a hole in a bubble, we got some sturgeon, we came back. We cooked some fish, we ate some fish. My suit was still wet so he said, \ufb01You wear my suit.\ufb02 So I went. I was the best dressed prisoner in the whole damn Soviet system. I came, everybody\u2122s oh-ing and oo-ing and the guards and especially the chachainsis.31 There were bunch of chachainsis. Chachainsis is a bunch \u0152 a bunch of son of a guns. They are cutthroats, they are thieves, they are murderers, everything. They kept looking. \ufb01Oh, too bad he is so small. Oh, too bad he is so small. We would take it off you.\ufb02 \ufb01You wouldn\u2122t take it off me.\ufb02 \ufb01I wouldn\u2122t?\ufb02 I said that, \ufb01What would you do to me?\ufb02 \ufb01Cut your head off, you stupid so and so.\ufb02 \ufb01You little so and so, you would cut my head off? We cut your head off.\ufb02 They frequently would \u0152 if somebody wa\u0152 had something they didn\u2122t\u0152 didn\u2122t want to give, they would come and cut his head off at night and took whatever they wanted. Anyway, they became my friends and protectors. I don\u2122t know why. I was just like a, like a little to\u0152 a flea, in comparison with them. 03:23:50"

            "answer": "Yeah, it was close to \u0152 it were close to Teheran, it was west of Teheran. It was kind of a desert area and there was some local people who traveled with herds of sheep and such, from place to place, so we would stay overnight with them. We just sleep outside, it was \u0152 you know, subtropics, it was warm and the \u0152 the British built camps already, so we went to the camp that was built for the refugees, by the British. And of course, pretty soon they started asking young men to come to lectures and come to training and, \ufb01Do you want to fight?\ufb02 \ufb01Of course, what do you think? I\u2122m going \u0152 I came here for it.\ufb02 And many people joined. And then I don\u2122t know if I want to divert. I think I will have to divert back, before I \u0152 I left Siberia. About six months after we be \u0152 were there, they fished out 17 young boys, between 16 and 19. And I was one of them and we went through a heavy indoctrination course. Eight, 10, 12 weeks, eight hours a day. Heavy indoctrination course. And if you \u0152 if I get the three of you in a secluded place, that you are not allowed to leave, in about two weeks, you\u2122ll believe any \u0152 everything that I will tell you. They \u0152 there\u2122s nothing better than Communism. Dialectical materialism is the only doctrine that works among peoples. Soviet Russia is the most powerful, most wise, most \u0152 the best of all, the richest. We have the riches in Siberia that you never heard of. We have enormous Ukrainian plains that we can \u0152 if we \u0152 planting our grain, we can s \u0152 we can feed the whole world. This is the best. You had to listen closely, you have to listen attentively. If you smirked, if you made a face, if you make a funny remark, you were thrown \u0152 your shoes were taken, your jacket was taken, you were thrown into solitary, which was six \u0152 what \u0152 four by four feet. Your shoes were taken, too, overnight. You had to dance, jump, run all night. If you sat down, you never waked up. Well, I was lucky, I spent only three nights. I couldn\u2122t keep my tongue. I mean I couldn\u2122t keep my mouth shut. I had to make remarks. I made faces, I laughed in his face, the politruk was a big man, had a face that was asking for a brick, too. I just sm\u0152 laughed in his face. And I told him once, \ufb01How little you know.\ufb02 So he was lenient with me, but still he, still he throw me in, in the solitary, one night at a time. If you spent two nights, you didn\u2122t make it. Some people \u0152 there were a few people who made it for two nights. Three nights nobody made, in a row. 04:09:33 Anyway, by the time we graduated, we had a talk, 45 minute talk. And if you missed two words, you were thrown into solitary, had to repeat it. You had to give a lecture that told everything about the dialect \u0152 dialectical materialism. You knew all about Engels 34, you knew all about Marx.35 You knew everything about Lenin.36 And you most about Stalin.37 I mean those were the holy \u0152 not a trinity, but a quadruplinity. And you had to talk about them in glowing terms. Your tone of your voice had to be just like a great 34 Friedrich Engels 35 Karl Marx 36 Vladimir Ilich Lenin 37 Joseph Stalin 30 sermon on a mount. And you know, by the \u0152 by the end of it, I believed, strongly. I became a honest to goodness believer. So when we were later let go and I think it was somewhat with premeditation that this little group was let go into the British part. Because we going to be the avant-garde of Communism. We are going to get introduced into armed forces or whatever groups there were and we\u2122re going to propagate it by going \u0152 we are going to be the true believers. And there \u0152 for some way or another, the British knew it. They collected us again. We went through a heavy indoctrination by the Polish political officers, by the British, who some spoke Polish, some worked with the translators. In about three weeks we lost the faith. We lost the true faith. And then they formed the armed forces. Yes, let\u2122s say they went to fight, they fought, fought all way to Monte Cassino. By Monte Cassino \u0152 when they took Monte Cassino, the second Polish corps \u0152 after British and the Australians and the Americans couldn\u2122t take it, they were so bloodied, they were sent to recuperation\u0152 04:11:40"

And the same and the same. And then sabotage, blowing up bridges, blowing up trains, blowing up buildings. Demolishing rail \u0152 train tracks, if you did not have explosives. And a lot \u0152 a lot of training with semi and automatic weapons. It was a time when the British introduced a sten gun and we trained a lot with the sten guns. We trained little with regular rifles, but they said, \ufb01When you get there, we will provide you with sten guns, you will have a lot of firepower.\ufb02 And a sten gun is similar to American Thompson submachine gun. But it\u2122s a piece of junk, actually. You shoot about 1700 rounds and you throw it away, because after 1700 rounds, becomes more dangerous to you than to your pos\u0152 opponent. Anyway, seven of us went on a trip. We walked, we rode trains, we hitched up rides on the tracks. We rode donkeys most of the time. We went through the western Iran, into northern Iraq. We went through the Kurdistan. By the way, the Kurdish people are the greatest people ever. They can cut your head off, if you have \u0152 if you have something they like, but if you come in, it is so much like in \u0152 in Poland, \ufb01Guest in, God in.\ufb02 They treat you like you were a god visit-visiting them. They give you food. They give you \u0152 what they have, they share with you. If you are ragged, they will give you shirt or pair of pants. But don\u2122t look at anything good they have, because they will give it to you. If you look at something, \ufb01Oh gee, this is so neat.\ufb02 They will let you sleep with his \u0152 with his wife if you like her. But you get out of a tent, they will follow you, cut your head off and take the stuff back. So we\u2122re told, \ufb01Be careful with the Kurds.\ufb02 04:16:00 Anyway, we walked through part of Turkey, we diverted into Syria and backed in Anatolia, Turkey, Anatolia. We did come to Bosporus Straits and we were kind of pursued at that time, we knew something was happening. We were being hunted. So we met a old fisherman on the Bosporus and he spoke Russian. He was an old Turk who spoke Russian. And said, \ufb01Grandpa, please take us across.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Lords, night is falling, there\u2122s going to be storm tonight, we cannot get a \u0152 go across.\ufb02 \ufb01Grandpa, please take us across, because we \u0152 if we don\u2122t leave here tonight, we may not be alive tomorrow. We know something is happening.\ufb02 The German had a Intelligence pe\u0152 Intelligence people in Turkey and they organized pursuit parties, we overheard before then. So he said, \ufb01Well, Lords, I\u2122m old, my boat is leaky and if you want to risk, what am I to say?\ufb02 So we said, \ufb01Grandpa, we\u2122ll pay you.\ufb02 \ufb01I don\u2122t want to be paid.\ufb02 So we said, \ufb01Grandpa, we\u2122ll give you the donkeys.\ufb02 \ufb01Donkeys, they\u2122re not worth anything. They are worn up completely.\ufb02 Said, \ufb01Grandpa, you give them on a p \u0152 good grass, they\u2122ll be as good as new in two or three weeks. Leave them here.\ufb02 We got in the boat, he gave each a \u0152 each one of us a piece of rope. \ufb01Tie yourself ti\u0152 s \u0152 well.\ufb02 Storm came. It was the scariest five hours I lived in my life \u0152 scariest. I was in dark places, but this was the 32 worst. I think I fell out about four times. If it wasn\u2122t for rope, I wouldn\u2122t be talking to you tonight. The Mediterranean fish would have eaten me up. Anyway, we did get to the Turkish side on the north side of \u0152 it was almost morning. Beautiful, quiet, sun was coming up. And the old Ismael said, \ufb01Lords, the Allah was with you. I don\u2122t want to be paid.\ufb02 But before we left, the British gave us some gold pieces. \ufb01Case you\u2122re in a tight spot, trading, whatever.\ufb02 So we said, \ufb01Grandpa, we don\u2122t want to pay you, we just want to give you baksheesh, a gift from the heart.\ufb02 And each one of us gave him a gold piece. He looked, said, \ufb01Oh my Allah. My granddaughter will get married, my younger daughter will get married, my grandson get married, I can pay dowry to every one of them and I\u2122m going to live high on the hog for the rest of my days.\ufb02 He got in his boat and a little breeze came, he just zoomed out of there. 04:19:05 And we walked across a part of Turkey, went into Bulgaria, we caught rides on trains \u0152 tracks, we head into Romania. We sneaked into Nazi occupied Poland. You know, the front li\u0152 eastern front was way, way out. By that time, on Polish territory, the Germans developed Einsatzgruppen,38 special forces. They call them Einsatzgruppen or Vernichtungsgruppen,39 the exterminators. So they were killing lot of Jewish people and they were killing all the Jewish people they could find. And they were killing a lot of Polish people. So the Polish underground suffered for a time. But then, when we came, they provided us with arms and ammunition and some unstable Polish dynamite. And we \u0152 each one of us \u0152 I was given 17 people. Seventeen plus two, plus \u0152 plus me. That were 20 people. And we became the exterminators of exterminators. We would create false alarms. Because when something happen in certain village or little town, they would just swoop upon it. They \u0152 those groups were about 100, 75 to 125 in each group. They would swoop around, swoop in, surround it, burn it down, kill everybody. That was their standard procedure. And when they went to a ghetto, they would just kill all the Jewish people in the ghetto. Of course, ghettos were already fenced in \u0152 barbed wired in. So we did few things with them and we blew up \u0152 we could not blow up \u0152 blow up complete bridge, but we blew up parts of a bridge. We demolished a lot of railroad tracks. We blew up some trains when we had explosives. And I was \u0152 oh, my gosh, my commander was a \u0152 I still don\u2122t know his name. His name was, was \ufb01B. Dab\ufb02 \u0152 \ufb01B. the Old Oak.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01You little shit, I\u2122m going to shoot you, I\u2122m going to court martial you, you missed it.\ufb02 I would sit in a field with the two wires and a battery, holding here and I would touch it and the damn thing would not explode and the train would go by. Or sometime I would blow it up before the train came. So after each incident \u0152 mishap like this, he would gave me a dressing and threaten me with, with an execution and court martial and God knows what. He was a big, fat man with a very sharp temper. 38 Task forces (German); mobile killing units, employed especially in the destruction of the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe. 39 Annihilation group (German) 33 04:22:03 And we slept in bunks. We slept on farms that were far away from habitations. We had dugouts in half a dozen different forests. Run around constantly. We did get surrounded a lot of times. We had to fight \u0152 were in lot of firefights with those groups. Were surrounded frequently by them and had to fight our way out. And about \u0152 in 1943, it was \u201a42, fall and winter when we started. Forty-three, in late spring, we hijacked German army bank on a street of Warsaw. We lost three people out of about 25 or 30 that were \u0152 but we got a lot of money. We got about 15 million marks. Each one was \u0152 one of us was given a bonus, and you were given operating expenses. I think we \u0152 my group got about half a million marks. And I had a drinking buddy, who was a young, German soldier, supply officer. So we had drinks, we met few times. I introduced him to some Polish girls. And we talked and he sold me about over 100 Schmeissers. Schmeisser is a light, automatic weapon, similar to American Thompson submachine gun, but much, much more effective. Much more effective. And I don\u2122t know how many, probably about 12, 15 million rounds of ammunition. So from then on, my little group of 17 plus three were carrying 27 Schmeissers, because some of the boys said, \ufb01I don\u2122t trust that damn German weapon, I want to carry two.\ufb02 So I said, \ufb01Well, you know, we have a \u0152 we join \u0152 we shared those with some other groups, but we have plenty of it in places, hidden places. If you want to carry 17 extra pounds, what am I to say? Go ahead, be my guest.\ufb02 The German groups \u0152 ordinarily each squad had one Schmeisser and the rest of them had manual Mauser rifles. So when we \u0152 from then on, we \u0152 on purpose, did \u0152 when it cato\u0152 came to firefight, let ourselves be surrounded. And then when we opened up, we went just like a hot knife through a piece of butter. They had to keep their heads down, or they lost them. And anybody who stuck their head up did not get up again. So we went out and went out and went out and \u0152 course we were losing people. At the start we lost like 11 people in two months. So the boys who were in my group said, \ufb01What do we do?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Well, I tried to train you, you refused to be trained. You think you know everything. You were as full of beans, you want to fight, well do \u0152 surely we fight, but are going to lose people constantly if you don\u2122t want to train.\ufb02 So they said, \ufb01Do anything that \u0152 to train us.\ufb02 So we did. For about four weeks, we got the guts out of ourselves. We did it the British way. The way the British Major Thompson did to us, we did to ourselves. From then on we became almost invincible. We would lose a person from time to time, but very, very seldom. 04:26:00"

            "answer": "We drop back to countryside, we took a week or two off, then we \u0152 most of the time we found the places we wanted to take care of ourselves. Sometime our commander would contact us and gave us \u0152 gave us an order to do this or to do that. And there was a \u0152 one of the Eisengrupp \u0152 Eisens \u0152 Eis \u0152 Einsatzgruppen in neighborhood where my \u0152 not exactly my own family neighborhood, but close by. It was in a town called Biala 34 Podlaska. It was about 100 kilometers east of Warsaw. There was the group that was large, it was very well entrenched. Very, very foxy, we just couldn\u2122t do anything to them. So he called me the carpet and he said, \ufb01You are supposed to take care of that group. You don\u2122t sa\u0152 you don\u2122t have to kill all of them, but really give them a good thrashing.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Commander, I tried \u0152 we tried everything, I tried everything, nothing works.\ufb02 Said, \ufb01You have to do something.\ufb02 \ufb01They are entrenched. They stay in a solid building, which used to be monastery, with a great gate. They built a wall around, there\u2122s some barbed wire on the top of it. There\u2122s electricity in the barbed wire. We just can\u2122t touch them.\ufb02 So he said, \ufb01Well, we can, come on here.\ufb02 Led me to the next room, open a wardrobe and he said, \ufb01Look at this. You see this nice, little Hitlerjugend40 uniform?\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01Oh, no you don\u2122t.\ufb02 Said, \ufb01Oh yes, I do.\ufb02 And as you can see, I was a little blonde boy \u0152 little blonde boy, this one on the right. This one here, with blue eyes and very, very bleached, bleached hair. So he said, \ufb01Put it on.\ufb02 So I put the thing, fitted me just right and a little \u0152 little \u0152 little jacket, shorts, you know. High socks, hobnail boots, little dagger, little hat. Said, \ufb01There, you look like a damn German Hitlerjugend.\ufb02 So I didn\u2122t have much choice. 04:28:40 In the afternoon, the boys brought me within about two or three blocks from that monastery. I just walked toward the gates, there were two burly SS men with the Schmeissers standing by the gate. And I said, \ufb01Heil Hitler, Heil Hitler. 41 Wie geht\u2122s denn, Junge42\ufb02 \ufb01Ganz gut.43\ufb02 \ufb01How are you young man?\ufb02 \ufb01Very well.\ufb02 \ufb01Wie geht\u2122s denn, Herr Oberst.44\ufb02 How about you, Commander? \ufb01Ganz gut.\ufb02 So I said, \ufb01I - Ich w\u00fcnschte mit ihre officer gesprochen.45\ufb02 I want to speak to your officer, your commander here. \ufb01Weiterweitermachen. 46\ufb02 \ufb01Go right in.\ufb02 So I went in, I went through the corridors, I went up the steps, I went to the back there and there was an outside window, I unlatched the window. I went downstairs again, I went to the back and I notice there\u2122s a gate there with a bolt, so I pulled the bolt slowly out. Then I went to the corr\u0152 second floor again \u0152 again had to go to second floor to go to the front, so I walked. There was some secretaries running out and some officers running back and forth. \ufb01Heil Hitler, Heil Hitler, Junge. 47 Wie geht\u2122s.48\ufb02 I walked out. Said, \ufb01Auf wiedersehen,49\ufb02 to those nice, two, big son of a so and so in the front. Walked out to the corner, walked beyond \u0152 about a block away, the boys are waiting with the car, they grabbed me, we ran away. I was so mad at myself. I wet my 40 Hitler youth (German); Nazi youth organization. 41 Hail Hitler (German) 42 How are you then, young man? (German) 43 Very good (German) 44 How are you then, Mr. Colonel? (German) 45 I wish to spoke [sic] with your officer. (German) 46 Continue (German) 47 Young man (German) 48 How are you? (German) 49 Good-bye (German) 35 pants. My pants were wet, my socks were wet, my shoes were squelching. I must have been afraid. And strange enough, I was in tougher places. I was being shot at, I was being hit, I was being mutilated, practically, but this must have been scary time that I had had. Was first and the last time that I wetted my pants. That night we came in and the commander came with us. B. Dab came with us. He said, \ufb01You know where everything is, so you go in.\ufb02 So I went with my big rucksack. And then we came with a ladder, we\u2122re going to climb to that window there. 04:31:05 End of Tape #4 36 Tape #5 05:00:06"

And the Germans had the Mongolians, from outer Mongolia, who volunteered to serve the Germans. They placed them along the railroad tracks to guard it.

Occa-occasionally some of us would go for a short visit, but very seldom because Germans had also quite good Intelligence. And they had a lot of local people who were reporting to them. So you had to be careful where you go, when you go. Like, for instance, I don\u2122t know if I was that religious, but frequently on Sunday I would sneak into the church, to my pastor. And he was friend of mine, I read all his books. I read all the books in the public library and school library and I discovered he had a big library, so I read all of his books and I served Mass. Oh my God, I served Mass forever, I was 19 and 20, I still served Mass. So he would say, \ufb01Oh Stefan, come on, serve the Mass.\ufb02 \ufb01Father, I can\u2122t. I messed up last night, I blew up a train. There were people on that train \u0152,\ufb02 or else I did something. \ufb01Come on, I\u2122ll listen to your confe\u0152 I\u2122ll hear your confession.

And if you did kill some soldiers on the train, some officers, this is a war.\ufb02 Anyways, I still occasionally spend sleepless night. So, it lasted \u0152 it was good when it lasted. And then in spring, early spring of 1944, I was caught in a lapanka. Lapanka is a round-up, like they caught slaves in Africa, like they go hunting and have a \u0152 surround meters and hunters. In Poland, the lapanka was an institution. The group of German Schutzpolizei51 would stop a train or a bus, mostly train, get everybody out, fish out all 50 Priest (Polish) 51 Conventional police (German) 39 the young people, put them in trucks, take them to process, processing, transit, camp building. And in our district, was the Skaryszewska, it was an \u0152 name after the \u0152 after the street in Warsaw, \ufb01Skaryszewska\ufb02 \u0152 processed you and sent you to compulsory labor in Germany. It was called the \ufb01free labor.\ufb02 So I left what I was carrying \u0152 I was carrying a suitcase of dynamite and some wiring, so I left it on the train. It was \u0152 I was a little boy, caught on a train traveling between Warsaw and \u0152 and whatever. 05:11:03 And of course I was sent to western part \u0152 I\u2122m sorry, eastern part of Germany, Silesia. Then there was almost like a \u0152 like a slave market. They took us to that Kreuzburg town, small town like a county town, Kreuzburg. We were kept \u0152 put in a \u0152 in a building next to a square \u0152 there we be walked out to the square and then farmers and people from different little factories, shops and so on, would come. \ufb01I\u2122ll take this one, I\u2122ll take that one, I\u2122ll take that one.\ufb02 \ufb01Okay. Here\u2122s your ai\u0152,\ufb02 they filled out an arbeitbuch,52 a little work book for you \u0152 your name and your employers name and you went and you were servant to that person. If you got to be on a farm, it wasn\u2122t too bad, because you had enough to eat. A group of us \u0152 the group of us, about 25 boys and 23 girls, between like 13 and 19 or so, were put in a village called Schorka and we worked in a forest, natching out the trees, pine trees and collecting the resin. Resin was used by German industry for making synthetic rubber. So we worked there about eight hours a day, worked in a group with a supervisor. And sometime the Stadtpolizei 53 worked with us, they try and they did not. So, some of us would be escaping now and then, of course, they would be apprehended and brought back and so on and so forth. And I worked there for, oh, probably three or four weeks. So a small group of us took off and went away. So, \ufb01I would \u0152 won\u2122t work for the damn Germans here. Let us go home.\ufb02 And the home was a general government the center of Poland, which was so called \ufb01Free Poland,\ufb02 it was under \u0152 it was a protectorate, Hans Frank was the gover-governor and it was run by the Germans, for the Germans, by the Germans and the Poles who were there had to give everything that they produced, they raised on the farm and so on, to the German war effort. But you were kind of semi-free. Anyway, those of us who were in the underground were free because we could go anyplace we want to. 05:13:47"

He said, \ufb01You didn\u2122t tell me a thing.\ufb02 So they gave me beating again and beating again and beating again. And then he said, \ufb01Well, that\u2122s enough, we are ready.\ufb02 So I had a \u0152 and normally, I mean, they just took out \u0152 they shoot you. They shoot everybody in the neighborhood and this case, they wanted to be so legalistic, they wanted to be so exact, that I had a case in court. I had a defense attorney, 59 We has [sic] the snake (German) 60 Snake (German) 42 Mr. Heinrich Schmidt. Yeah, Heinrich Schmidt. And he was telling \u0152 he was talk to the court \u0152 it was the Volksgericht.61 People who did not have any training in law, appointed by the German authorities to deal punishment sentences. So, my attorney was asking for three death sentences. And the \u0152 I don\u2122t remember \u0152 or did \u0152 I don\u2122t know if I ever knew the name of the judge. He said, \ufb01Two, enough. Zwei ganz genug. Zwei ganz genug. 62\ufb02 So he gave me two death sentences. And then he stamped \ufb01N and N\ufb02 on my document. \ufb01N and N\ufb02 is, is \ufb01Nacht und Nebel.63\ufb02 \ufb01Night and fog.\ufb02 05:24:05 A person who got a sentence \u0152 who even did not get a sentence, but had an N and N on his documents, he was sent to concentration camp, he was finished off \u0152 taken to the gas chamber or given an injection \u0152 phenol injection. Or went to the bunker to starve to death, or got mutilated or got hung in a \u0152 in a camp square. His documents were destroyed. His ashes were \u0152 his family was not notified to send seven marks for the ashes. You disappeared just like in a night and fog. So I was the Nacht und Nebel baby. I stayed in prison, in Lubliniec for two, three weeks. I healed. I could sleep on my back. When I got there, I could sleep only on my stomach. There were 17 of us in a two person cell. We slept like sardines in a can on the floor. And the one who was the latest, had to sleep next to k\u00fcbel.64 And k\u00fcbel was a garbage pail that everybody emptied themselves. So I slept next to the k\u00fcbel for about a week. And of course I advanced, later on. But after about two or three nights, they looked at me, at my back and they said, \ufb01Well, maybe you should move little here. Maybe we can put you in that corner, there,\ufb02 \u201acause I, \ufb01you don\u2122t look so great.\ufb02"

So I never prayed for something, not even for release, not even for a longer life. I knew I wouldn\u2122t live to be 20.

Anyway, after the sentence, I stayed there in a prison for a short time, then I went on a transport to Gross-Rosen concentration camp, which is in western Poland presently. At that time it was in eastern East Germany, close to Opole, German Oppeln. I was there in transit, in the block number 12, which was a subterranean block. It was a time \u0152 it was just a time when Polish Prince Radziwill 65 was sent to Gross-Rosen. The Germans wanted him to from Polish government under German auspices and he refused. So they sent him to concentration camp. He was a brother-in-law of Mrs. Kennedy. Kennedy\u2122s \u0152 Mrs. Kennedy\u2122s sister married one of the \u0152 his \u0152 that Polish Prince Radziwill, who was in Great Britain then. Anyway, Prince Radziwill came with a servant.

Killing prisoners right and left, to survive. When I first came, we got into that barrack, we were put three people to the bunk and a bunk was about two and a half foot wide. Three people to a bunk and bunks were three piles high. So I went in the corner between the bunk and I stood against the wall, because my back, my seat, my \u0152 was kind of awful.

Came to Mauthausen, got shaved, got disinfected, went to the showers, were given a pair of clodhoppers, wooden shoes and a prison uniform and went to a barrack. Barracks zwei und zwanzig70 \u0152 the first quarantine. There was a main camp and a first quarantine. First quarantine they had barracks 21, 22, 23. After that there was a wall, there was 24 and 25, but those were the bunker barracks, where people went, never to get out. Anyway, barrack 22 was the barrack of the people with \ufb01N and N.\ufb02 So we went to a little chamber where they gave shots, phenol, derivative of gasoline. It is the most horrible death you can ever have. You die for about 45 minutes. That courses through your veins, gets into your heart several times, and you just die in a horrible torment. Just the worse thing ever. I saw dead people who died that way. They looked like the gargoyles on Notre-Dame Cathedral. Or they went on a transport, or went to Gusen Zwei,71 never to come out. Or they went to gas chamber, or they went on special transport behind the front line. If something happened behind the front line, in a town or village, they would hang 10, 15, 20 local hostages and let them hang there for \u0152 sometime for weeks. If they did not have local people, they would bring people from concentration camp and execute them there. But for some strange reason, after a very short time, I was whisked out, my number was read, I was put by the gate with 500 people. We marched again to the train depot, which was about like three, four kilometers, through the little town of Mauthausen. Put on a train and went to Vienna. And put in a concentration camp which was a sub-camp of Mauthausen, 11th Bezirk72 kolo Wiednia. 73 And we\u2122re put to work in an armament factory. It was an Ostermann-Sauer Werke, which built tractors and cars. It was a SwissAustrian-American company, built cars and trucks.

Most of what we were supposed to get, the people who handled it stole and ate and gorged themselves on. It wasn\u2122t too bad, actually. When I think back, it wasn\u2122t too bad.

They filled your mouth with a \u0152 with gypsum, so you couldn\u2122t yell, took you out and hanged you in a marketplace. So that was it. Said, \ufb01Oh gosh, now I got to watch. I have that knife, I have all the jewelry.\ufb02 Nothing do it \u0152 doing. Went to Vienna, they backed up prison van to the train and two people with truncheons and two people with machine guns \u0152 into, into it, they drove into \u0152 us to the Elizabethpromenade \u0152 huge prison, put us in a cell. Next morning, likewise. Put us in a train. We went through Budejovice, we went as far as Brno in Czechoslovakia. They put us in old Franciscan monastery that was made into prison. The walls, they were 12 foot thick walls. That was a fortress. But I see, in quite a big cell, 78 Great gate (German) 79 Personal effects chamber (German); warehouse for confiscated belongings of prisoners. 80 Canada commando (German); term used to refer to commando of prisoners assigned to work in the camp\u2122s warehouse of looted goods. 81 Heaven (German) 50 there were 12 of us and there were another 15 of others. Anyway, there were girls next door. So we made a hole in that \u0152 well, it wasn\u2122t just the big, it was like a plaster wall, so we made a hole and I laid whole night talking to girls. Bunch of Czech, pretty Czech girls. They send me a paper, they send me a piece of candy and we talk blue streak all night. And the next night and the next night and those people who are with me, those prisoners who are with me said, \ufb01My gosh\ufb02 \u0152 those were Bibelforscher 82 people, those were Baptist people. And he said, \ufb01We are supposed to be freed when we get to \u0152 to Opole, we\u2122re supposed to be freed.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Well, count your blessings, if you get freed, you\u2122ll get freed.\ufb02 Anyway, the fourth day, we\u2122re put on a train, say goodbye to the pretty girls across the street \u0152 across the wall \u0152 put us in a train. And we keep watching and I see the same views. We were going through Vienna and going west again. We got back to Mauthausen. The place \u0152 later on discovered the place where I was supposed to be disposed of \u0152 was overran by the Reds. The Soviet army was there already. And Germans being so indit\u0152 I mean outrigh\u0152 Langsam aber Sicher, 83 slow and great and just exactly that way, no other way \u0152 took us back to the concentration camp. 06:23:41 We came back with a group \u0152 big group of prisoners from prisons in Vienna and elsewhere, probably two or three, 400 of us. There were tables ready, the registering tables. All the blockschrei\u0160blockschreibers84 were there, including my block secretary standing \u0152 sitting there at tables, you know they write your data, take your document if you have any and give you a number, give you a bracelet with your number and tell you where to go. So he was sitting there, he, \ufb01Stefan, come on, come on, come on here.\ufb02 So I went and I said, \ufb01Bujwid.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Well, welcome again. Great you made it \u0152 great you made it.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01What do you mean great you made it? I was supposed to be freed.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Yeah, you were going to himmel.\ufb02 And there was a priest, Father Iwanski. Before I left, he listened to my confession, he gave me absolution and he said, \ufb01You are be freed, with the next three or four days, you\u2122ll be free. And pray for us.\ufb02 So I ca \u0152 later on I talked to Father Iwanski, I said, \ufb01You son of a gun, what do you think it was? Didn\u2122t you know I was going to by hung?\ufb02 \ufb01Well, you know, I wanted to cheer you up. But I gave you absolution, so you will go straight to paradise.\ufb02 So I, \ufb01I probably will go to the deepest hell, what I \u0152 for all what I did so far.\ufb02 Anyway, Mr. Bujwid, \ufb01Here\u2122s your number, here\u2122s your bracelet, go to the showers and go to the barrack. You got \u0152 you got barrack 22, you\u2122re going to my block.\ufb02 And I looked and I said, \ufb01I don\u2122t want this damn number, this a zugang numbers, this is a new prisoner number. I want my number. I am a prominente. 85\ufb02 By that time I was a prominent prisoner. If you survive six months, you become prominent prisoner. And out of those 600 that I came with, in six months there were 13 of us left, only. So by \u0152 by the time \u0152 when you became prominente, you have 82 Biblical scholar (German); term used to refer to Jehovah\u2122s Witnesses. 83 Slow but sure (German) 84 Block clerk (German) 85 Prominent (German); term used in concentration camps for privileged prisoners. 51 special consideration.

Each block had a Block\u00e4ltester, block leader, which was in most cases German criminal and a block secretary who knew German very well, could write and read very well. So he was it. And it was an important function, even though he didn\u2122t cherish it because he had to lead \u0152 he had to call a lot of people to execution or to bunker or to injection or to gas chamber or to a \u0152 to go on a transport.

If you ever see a little book called my \u0152 Man\u2122s Search for Meaning, it was translated into English, many of his books were translated, he was a psychoanalyst. And he \u0152 when he came to Mauthausen, I don\u2122t know if \u0152 if he came from Auschwitz or elsewher e, he was just on his last leg. He lost his spoon, he lost his dish and with those two, you were dead. But he had a big bundle of papers.

And what do you do in your life?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I did nothing, I was a student and I was doing some little work after that \u0152 before the Germans caught me. What did you do?\ufb02 \ufb01Well, I was a doctor and I\u2122m a doctor of psychology.\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01Where\u2122s your spoon?\ufb02 \ufb01Oh, I lost it.\ufb02 \ufb01Where\u2122s your dish?\ufb02 \ufb01Oh, I lost it.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Man, you dead, because you won\u2122t get your soup, you won\u2122t get anything to eat with.\ufb02 And if you try to catch some \u0152 some servers would give it into your hat, but most of them wouldn\u2122t.

For next few days we just talked and every time we felt bad, it was just \u0152 end was coming, you know, people are being taken to gas chamber and places. He\u2122s a \u0152 he said, \ufb01Oh, sit down here, let\u2122s talk.\ufb02 So we talk blue streak and we got cheered up. He developed a \u0152 a special kind of psychotherapy call \u0152 called logotherapy. And he\u2122s went talking on \u0152 on \u0152 talking tours through United States many times. One time he came in 1970\u2122s, late 70\u2122s and we couldn\u2122t get together, but I phoned him at Coffman Union at the University here and he called me back at work and then he talk \u0152 we \u0152 he phoned at night and we talked for about three hours, from about 12 until 3:30. Said, \ufb01Well, I got to go, my train is \u0152 my plane is leaving shortly.\ufb02 So we said, \ufb01Auf wiedersehen\ufb02 and then \u0152 anyway, he survived, but when \u0152 I never thought he would make it, but he did. He stayed in Mauthausen to the very \u0152 time of liberation. But, my case, again, I was fished out after a few \u0152 in a few days after the great crowds came and I was transported to Gusen Zwei, which was a walking distance. Gusen Eins92 was about two mi\u0152 two kilometers, Gusen Zwei was about five kilometers, so we walk ed. There were about 5,000 of us walked that day. We were gather at the nightfall. We were \u0152 our clothes was taken, only belt and shoes were left on us. Our clothes was taken to be disinfected. We went to showers, which were cold at that time. We were put outside and we stayed until about four a.m. I was still quite nimble and quite healthy. I got in the middle of a group. My head kind of froze, but at morning we found about 500 people who were dead, out of 5,000. This is only 10 percent. 07:09:16"

Every week 5,000 prisoners came, sometime 10,000. And it never went above 50. Never went about 40. In a week would be 40. About \u0152 attrition ration was about 20 percent a week. Was a horrible work, we worked digging tunnels under mountain. The tunnels were buil\u0152 dug especially to put armament industries in them. They already built tanks. They built Messerschmitt \u0152 Messerschmitt planes. And I think they built also rocket planes that they used \u0152 I mean, the Vau-Eins, 93 Vau-Eins, Vau-Zwei,94 to bomb England. But I\u2122m not sure of that. But I knew they built Messerschmitts. But I was on a crew that was digging the tunnel, digging with a \u0152 straight ahead of you, in a kind of a softish stone, with a air drill. And a person as strong as he is, or he is, could stand about four days. After four days you broke down. Well, I stood it for about seven days and I was given a shovel to shovel because I couldn\u2122t lift it any more. And I had a Yugoslavian friend \u0152 Janko \u0152 Janko, I can\u2122t remember his last name. He lasted 27 days drilling.

            "answer": "We had a gas chamber, but I \u0152 no, there was a gas chamber in Gusen One, but not Gusen Zwei. But the mortality ratio was so enormous that \u0152 that nothing else was necessary. Of course the Kapos killed their portion of people every day. We went to camp, I mean went to work \u0152 on the way home we carried five, six, 10 - 15 - 20 people out of a hundred. Carried them because they were killed at the job. Some dropped dead but most of them 95 Crook from Rostov (Russian) 96 I walked in pockets (Russian) 97 Runner (German) 58 were killed by the Kapo. Kapo would get a cigarette for every person he killed. If he were a heavy smoker, he killed a lot of people. Also, there was a Krankenhaus, there was a hospital and if you went to Krankenhaus, never came back, of course \u0152 but some people did. So from time to time, they would have a \u0152 a Krankenhaus had to be disinfected. So they would take the people from a Krankenhaus and make them walk across the railroad tracks to another barrack that was empty, kind of a temporary Krankenhaus and keep them there, and there would be a line of Kapos lined up on each side of the group walking. Anybody who would walk, they ran a gauntlet. They had ax handles on \u0152 or two by fours, and anybody who did not run, was killed. So I remember once in the first of February, 1945, they killed that night, 400 sick people out of 700, about 300 only made it, could run. The rest were killed. I had a friend at that time, he was a Polish mountaineer. He was a tough son of a \u0152 he was just wiry, he was strong. He was everything. Anyway, he got sick or he \u0152 maybe he malinger. So he was sent to the hospital. He went to hospital, couple nights later comes a Kapo from a hospital and say \u0152 calls my number, so I answer him, and said, \ufb01You have a friend in the hospital.\ufb02 \ufb01Yes, I have a friend in the hospital.\ufb02 \ufb01His \u0152 his name is Janko the G\u00f3ral, 98 \ufb01John \u0152 little Johnny, the mountaineer.\ufb02 \ufb01Yes.\ufb02 \ufb01Well,\ufb02 he said, \ufb01that window, so he wants you to come and see him at that window.\ufb02 So at night I sneaked in \u0152 that was not allowed. To get out of a barrack, going get killed. So I went and I knocked the window, he opened it up and, \ufb01Oh, Stefan, come tomorrow and bring me a big jug of water. I\u2122m so thirsty, there\u2122s not enough water here. Here.\ufb02 So he gave me a little bundle. I came back, there were about seven portions of bread. It was a fortune. Eating an extra portion a day, keep you alive and up your spirit for at least a week, maybe 14 days. So I brought him some water next day and I said, \ufb01Janko, where did you get all that bread?\ufb02 \ufb01Well, you know, those damn Muselmans 99.\ufb02 Muselmans was a name for people who were on their last foot. You know, they just lay there, they can\u2122t eat, they hold their bread. So when the Fliegeralarm100 comes, you know, night, when the lights are out and planes are flying \u0152 lights are all \u0152 all the lights are off, he just went from bed to bed and swiped the bread and lived high on the hog. 07:20:34 And I said, \ufb01Janko, but this is un-Christian.\ufb02 \ufb01They are going to die anyway. I\u2122m not going to \u0152 I \u0152 I\u2122m not killing them, but they can\u2122t eat. They have bunches of bread sitting there, they just can\u2122t eat.\ufb02 So we both \u0152 and all my friends in the barrack, lived high on the hog. And Janko came back, got out of a ba\u0152 of a hospital, came back to the barrack and he was given three days of convalescence. He was staying in the barrack, did not have to go to work. And the Kapo, day Kapo in the barrack, ask him to do something and Janko said, \ufb01You so and so, get away from me. I\u2122m convalescing, I\u2122m sick.\ufb02 So the man 98 Mountaineer, uplander (Polish) 99 Muslim (German); camp term used to refer to prisoners who had lost the will to live and were near death. 100 Aid-raid alarm (German) 59 took his tool and beat Janko to death. I came at night and one of our friends said, \ufb01Your friend is there.\ufb02 There was a \u0152 you know, there was a big, high stone wall between each barrack and next barrack. And we lined up, you know laid down, it was 10 - 20 - 50 people a day who were dying. So I went. Yes, Janko was still there, laying, his head bashed in. So I did have his address. I wrote to his family after the war and his sister answered and she said, \ufb01Well, my mother feels so bad because Janko was taken because he argued with her, so he volunteered and went to work in Germany and he got himself charge with sabotage and sent to concentration camp. And please tell me, did he have a nice casket? How was he buried, did he have a priest?\ufb02 Janko, with probably 500 others, next day, was dumped into big wagon, that about 50 prisoners pushed and pulled. They just had big sides and their wheels were just like the Conestoga wagons in America there, but bigger. And they pushed and pulled to the first Gusen Eins, where the crematorium was. Gusen Zwei did not have a crematorium, so that the bodies, probably four or 500 a day, sometime maybe 1,000 a day were wheeled to Gusen Eins to be cremated. 07:23:07"

Oh, they talk blue streak. \ufb01Because we both are from the holy Zmudz.\ufb02 Because the little boy was from the same territory that Mr. Bujwid was.

A Swedish Red Cross person, whose name nobody ever found, came to speak to the commander, General Pohl,104 P-o-h-l. And he came to talk to him and General Pohl was complaining, he said, \ufb01See here,\ufb02 was a telegram or was a letter. \ufb01I have an befehl 105 here,\ufb02 I have an order, \ufb01to lead all these people I have left here, about 42,000, into the tunnel. The ends of the tunnels are already mined to be dynamited and those people will suffocate there, within in probably one, two hours.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01If it was only telephone order, I probably could escape not doing it, but is a befehl, it\u2122s a telegram, I had to sign for it. What I am going to do?\ufb02 He was not \u0152 he was not a very bad person, that man was. Matter of fact, he had a case in court later on and some of us testified for him. Anyway, when this man left his office, the document disappeared. The man \u0152 and the general was diverted somewhat \u0152 the man swiped it. He borrowed a bicycle from a German guard, then he borrowed a horse. And the American front line was just beyond Linz. It was probably 30 - 35 - 40 miles. He went across the whole front line on a horse, then \u0152 he in tie and suit. Why the German Ges\u0152 SS didn\u2122t kill him, I don\u2122t have an idea. Did he talked to somebody, I don\u2122t have an idea. Did he identify himself, I don\u2122t have an idea. He got across, he got as far as General Patton106 headquarters. And nobody wanted to talk to him, so he bothered everybody there and eventually somebody did talk to him. So he mentioned that, he described it. So they said, \ufb01Okay, come on in, come on in.\ufb02 They let him talk to assistant to Patton. And then Patton came and asked a few questions. And Patton sent five American tanks. They broke across the front line, they went and went and went. They came to Gusen Zwei, they took few potshots at the guard towers. The SS people surrendered. They left tank, I think about five soldiers, to guard those 800 SS, who are herded into \u0152 into \u0152 into a big kind of a barn. And the rest of us, who were just barely moving, because we haven\u2122t gotten anything to eat about four days and my case, I was flat on my back. I couldn\u2122t even turn over. Then the four tanks went to Mauthausen, five more miles and sur\u0152 and get around, too few \u0152 took few potshots at the guard towers. 104 The interviewee later corrected this name to Max Pausch, Kommandant of Gusen II. 105 Order (German) 106 Gen. George Smith Patton 64 3,000 SS people surrendered and there was bedlam in Mauthausen. It was not much of a bedlam in Gusen Zwei because most of us were just about done for. 08:09:07"

Calcium \u0152 calcium shots. Calcium shots. And when you get the shot, you get hot from your tip of your toe \u0152 fingers to tippy toes and to your head, you just get pleasantly hot. And that was supposed to sh\u0152 to dry up that liquid in your lungs. And after a few weeks, when a nurse was coming with a needle, my veins went south. She would jab and jab and jab and she could not find a vein. She said, \ufb01Just don\u2122t look when I come. I don\u2122t want you to see, because your veins disappear.\ufb02 My both arms were just like \u0152 like I was a heavy addict to God knows what. But it didn\u2122t dry it. It didn\u2122t dry, they had to make a puncture in the back and pump it out. And they couldn\u2122t put me under, because I would never wake up. So two big men, just like those two, big clunks held me and the doctor went back and he made \u0152 punctured my back and he pumped, oh probably gallon and a half of horrible liquid.

I didn\u2122t die of TB and I did not have to ever have it pumped again, except that I have two big stones on the bottom of my lungs, because the calcium goes all the organism and collects in your lungs and settles on the bottom.

You know, you talk to young people \u0152 I spoke to about 110 young people in a middle school about two weeks ago. And they had a course on Holocaust, they wanted to know what was going on. They don\u2122t know who Hitler was. They heard little of Stalin, they don\u2122t remember who Roosevelt was. They learn little 119 The places and times of terror should never be forgotten. (German) 75 about the Holocaust. They were living \u0152 reading Elie Wiesel, the book \u0152 little book, Night. They were just about few pages gone and they wanted to ask many questions and I told them little story. So I frequently go and talk to group \u0152 various groups of people, willingly, and few of us that are still alive should not forget. And it seems like your people with the museum there and whatever information you impart to people must have some influence, because a lot of schools, even grade schools, have a special course every year on the Holocaust. And as far as I know, almost all the middle schools here, especially the religious schools, Catholic and Lutheran schools, do have it too."

They\u2122d have two huge suitcases of explosives, get on the train, they spoke little German. They\u2122re pretty young girls. Well, frequently they would get into a German car \u0152 a bunch of German soldiers, officers had a special car, so they\u2122re, \ufb01M\u00e4dchen, m\u00e4dchen, kommen Sie hier. 121\ufb02 So they would came with the big suitcase that the German would pick up the suitcase, put it up on the upper. Because there were controls frequently, they would stop a train and search and contraband like food, the 120 Sandy hill (Polish); colloquially \ufb01cemetary.\ufb02 121 Girls, girls, come here! (German) 76 so-called black market, which was a free market, people training would be stole \u0152 taken away from people. So if you are pretty girl and you carry that, Germans invited you, took your bundle there and nobody could come and search you. And they would come to Warsaw and said, \ufb01auf wiedersehen\ufb02 and \ufb01danke sch\u00f6n\ufb02 and went blissfully their own way with four big suitcases, carrying enough stuff to blow up four \u0152 four or five trains. But the Communists got them. They said, \ufb01But we helped you.\ufb02 \ufb01Well, helpers like you we don\u2122t need any more.\ufb02 Just like with my four boys. \ufb01Helpers like you we don\u2122t need any more.\ufb02 09:15:59 And mainly, we were helpers in one aspect. In 1943, in summer, a Communist young man, slightly older than I, came and talk \u0152 talked. He said, \ufb01Stefan, we need to blow up something and I know that you can do it.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01You\u2122re a dirty Communist. I wouldn\u2122t bend my finger to do anything for you.\ufb02 \ufb01But you know, you really got to help us. You really got to help us.\ufb02 So I talked to my commander and my commander said, \ufb01Oh, you stupid so and so. Go help them? If you go and lose your behind, it will serve you well because you lost your head already.\ufb02 But he reconsidered. Few days later he came and said, \ufb01Yes, you can go and help them. I talked \u0152 we talked.\ufb02 So they provided me with two \u0152 well, they gave me two of my boys and myself and a load of explosives. And provided us with a German chauffeur. German chauffeur who was carrying a truckload of arm \u0152 war material to a certain spot. And we\u2122re going to that spot. It was kind of an army filled depot. There were a lot of explosives there and then tanks and aircraft bombs and God knows what else. So he left us out in the forest. He went and delivered the stuff and then came back and he was going to wait for us in the forest. And I was told, \ufb01You send one boy, if he doesn\u2122t make it, send a second one. Don\u2122t go yourself, because if you go, you get court martialed when you get back.\ufb02 So one of my boys went in, he went under the first wire and had a little shovel, dug out. Then he went to a second wire and a dog got him. And the guards, the SS guards came in and shot him. And well, he didn\u2122t suffer because they shot what he had with him and he just gro\u0152 got blown up to smithereens. So then I said, \ufb01Well, your turn.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01No, I\u2122m not going.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01But you have to, you swore.\ufb02 \ufb01You can shoot me, I\u2122m not going. I\u2122m not going to help those son of a bitches against those son of a bitches.\ufb02 So I said, \ufb01Well, you don\u2122t have much choice, do we? I have to shoot you.\ufb02 \ufb01Well, go ahead and shoot me. You\u2122re my friend. I would rather be \u0152 be shot by a friend than \u0152 then relative.\ufb02 So I said, \ufb01Well,\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I\u2122m going to try, but be sure when we come back, don\u2122t you ever tell.\ufb02 Said, \ufb01I\u2122ll save my life, I won\u2122t tell.\ufb02 09:19:11 So I went \u0152 I went to the first place, I went to a second place, there was still stuff around. It was muddy also, but was quite muddy from the person who blew up. And a dog came and for quite sometime \u0152 I don\u2122t know if I had \u0152 it\u2122s like I had affinity with dogs. Actually when we walked \u0152 my group walked to the village and I was with them, not a single dog would bark. And a bunch of dogs would fo\u0152 I would go \u0152 walk behind and a bunch of dogs would follow me and squeal \u0152 wanted to be petted. So the dog came and 77 he squealed and I petted him and he raised his \u0152 his \u0152 his leg and sprayed me from head to toe. I was so mad at that dog. I said, \ufb01If that was elsewhere, I would show you what is what.\ufb02 And the guards came by and the dog followed them and I was right at their feet there. They never looked. So I scrambled in \u0152 I walked in. I had \u0152 I always ruled by 17, I had \u0152 my lucky 17. So I went for my 17 charges, put them here and there. Then I got out the same way, I watched the guards when they just passed. I got from \u0152 was a kind of a half truck standing nearby, got from behind it. Scrambled under one wire and a second wire and ran like hell. Got to my boy, grabbed him and we both ran like hell. We got to the forest. Probably was a good kilometer, was like three-fourths of a mile. He started the truck, we drove. We drove like hell for about 10 - 15 minutes and it blew up. The first explosion blew up all the windows in the truck, back and front. And then it blew and it blew and it blew and it blew. It was just like an atomic f \u0152bomb fireworks. They were preparing pa \u0152 putsch on Moscow and the Russians \u0152 and the Russian under \u0152 Soviet underground wanted badly to demolish this. So that\u2122s why my boys, after the war were invited to the big party. \ufb01You did for us, you did for us, but now we don\u2122t need you any more. Also, people like you we don\u2122t need here. Out you go.\ufb02 And they asked about me and they said, \ufb01The Germans got him, probably killed him.\ufb02 09:21:55"

Presently I have them very seldom. I probably will have one next couple nights. When I saw Schindler\u2122s List \u0152 after I saw Schindler\u2122s List, I had a couple real \u0152 just almost like \u0152 like it really happened there and I was there back \u0152 back there. But it is so far away. One time, St. Paul Cathedral was showing a film, Nacht124 \u0152 Night and Fog. The film still exists. It was made by the Polish French company and you can still get the video of it. Anyway, I was asked to come and watch with them and to talk about it later on. Well, it was shortly after I came here and after that went \u0152 that went through, I could not talk, mainly because I saw the steps. Hundred and eighty-six steps from a stone quarry, leading to the camp in Mauthausen. And I walked those steps for 11 days, carrying a big stone. When you first came into Mauthausen, you went through the introduction, you were put in a Strafkommando, punishment company. You went down to the quarry and you went up, you went down. Oh, it was about six, seven times a day and you took the biggest stone you could carry, because if you didn\u2122t, when you got to about 100 steps up, the Kapo would look and said, \ufb01Hey you and you and you and you, step out there. You stupid so and so. Look at the rest of them, they are just breaking down, getting ruptures. And you took two those little stones?\ufb02 So he give them a push and they would fly down. And that happened just about every day. Five, 10 - 15 -20 people would be killed a day, in the Strafkommando. And sometime, when he had a special order, they would make people run. It was Fliegerbr\u00fccke, 125 the flying bridge. There was a kind of a little platform and he would run people to the platform and they would fly down, like two or 300 feet. And then the quarry supervisor started complaining that they messed \u0152 \ufb01He is messing up my work, so make him stop. That so and so is 124 Night (German) 125 Flyer\u2122s bridge (German) 82 messing up my work. He had all those \u0152 those \u0152 all that mess, those smashed prisoners there. I have to clean it up every day.\ufb02 10:07:37 So it kind of abated, but he was still killing people. If he didn\u2122t do that, when you \u0152 didn\u2122t like you or you got close up and the upper was kind of a steep road into the gate, front gate of the Grosse Tor \u0152 he would take your hat, we had those stripped berets \u0152 he would take it and make it fly beyond the post line. And you had to put your stone down, everybody waited and you went to retrieve it. And that was a no-no, because it was beyond the line, and people up on the tower there would open up and shoot you. Sometimes they would just wound you, most of the time they would kill you. And you had to go and retrieve your hat because if you walked to the gate, you had to take your hat and walk at attention, you know, your hat to your leg and walk stiffly and carry your big stone here, you know. Straighten up. SS at the gate, if you did not have a hat to take off, they would take you \u0152 take you aside and beat you \u0152 most of the time they would take you aside and shoot you. There would be pile of people, dead bodies on the side, people who did not have their hats with them. Those little exercises. I made it for 11 days and lived to tell. Anyway, it was kind of a little introduction to the system."

            "answer": "Yes, I \u0152 I stayed and worked most of the time, most of the people didn\u2122t. They didn\u2122t want to. People who stay in places who don\u2122t have to work, they don\u2122t want to work. We talk sometime about our welfare people, they\u2122re paid little and not to have to work. 83 People who don\u2122t work, won\u2122t work. There were probably \u0152 out of five, eight, 10,000, in Wildflecken, maybe 200 of us who worked. The rest of the people didn\u2122t. And I knew one person who was a black market operator, he was a rich \u0152 one rich young man. And each person were living in a camp had to donate half a day work to the camp, like chopping trees for the fuel, sweeping streets or doing something. Well, he didn\u2122t. So he was called to the camp director and the camp director said, \ufb01Mr. So and So, I have a report here you haven\u2122t worked last week.\ufb02 And said, \ufb01Mr. Director, that\u2122s a lie. I never worked.\ufb02 \ufb01You never worked? You are supposed to work.\ufb02 \ufb01I pay well, people who go and work for me. When my time comes, there is a person who goes and works for me hard, for half a day or a day, I pay him well. Mr. Director, that\u2122s a lie, I never worked.\ufb02 That was the mentality of \u0152 that people developed. Later on when they went to various countries, there were some were repatriated to Poland, but very few. When Communism took over, they did not want to, as I didn\u2122t want to. Many went to Canada, many went \u0152 many \u0152 some \u0152 everybody wanted to come to America. Some went to Belgium, some went to England. Many went to Australia and New Zealand. While those people had \u0152 at times had a hard time adjusting back and going back to work. So I stayed in Wildflecken until 1949 and the U.S. Catholic Conference found a sponsor here and I went through the consul and a doctor and document this and document that \u0152 all kind of little documents. As the Russians said, \ufb01S propiskom vsy\u00eb mozhna 126 zrobic.127\ufb02 With a little card, you can do almost anything. Ru\u0152 in Russia, if you had to have a propiska 128 to move from place to place, to visit next village, you have to have a propiska issued by police because you cannot move freely. Well, now maybe you can, but that time you could not. So all this little documents and you had to go through a doctor and \u0152 well, I worked part time with American CIC. 129 They came one time when I was still in Aschaffenburg. 10:13:30"

By the window, birch racing for the sky, Candlelight timidly shines afar. Stillness, only aspen leaves whisper softly. By mother hands, the light shines bright, By prie\u0152 by prayer blessed, so then suddenly alive. This one and that one took flight to God, Praying and begging for plenty to all, Health of a husband and children\u2122s health. Father in a mood, not ugly, sat behind the table. Did not loose faith in good times to come, So that instead of hope in the promissory notes, For his tedious sewing, simple cash will flow. Three dishes served of yore in Jerusalem, Gefilte fish in fish sauce and a soft challah, Chicken soup with beans with angel hair macaroni, Hen \u0152 Jewish style \u0152 divided to make eight quarters of one. Sabbath is for your rest, just like good Lord ordered And with His Torah to proclaim his name. To perform ablutions and all those good deeds \u0152 Good deeds do always, not only on the Sabbath day.

Dahlias in bloom, charmed and enchanted us, Safe ha \u0152 safe harbor here I searched for in a Far Eastern way. Sabbath at times comes in dreams. The same stars are shining by, 91 The same dahlias still bloom. And still of great old times, we daydream.\ufb02 That\u2122s it. 11:06:22"
