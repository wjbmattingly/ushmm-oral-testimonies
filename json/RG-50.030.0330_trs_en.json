It was a certain circle where the people thought the state should mix in as little as possible. The state should have nothing to do with religion, therefore they had their own church, built their own church and had their own priest. Also, they made their own school, and my father was chosen as the teacher. We were not allowed say , as people usually do. It was two fine words. About 75 children went to my father and only nine children when to the official school."

What interested me was the ideology in different times. The development of the human spirit. So, I started with something called comparing literature. Comparing all the different cantors literature. Then I was in love with a young lady and all told me that this would not give me an earning. Only if you should be a professor and that would be two places in Denmark. So, I started to study as other people two literatures and that was German and Danish. And I finished that. My first book was comparison between and  who are completely different ideas but who psychologically are very alike. They don't like the people as they are. , you would say that it was first an ape then it was a mensch, and then the next step must be an  mensch.

She was born in Hamberg and she wanted to go to Israel, but Israel was a British mandate, and to go to Israel they demanded that you have learned an agriculture thing. She was a photographer of x-rays in hospitals. Then she chose to Sweden and learn poultry farming. And one day one of my friends from Hamberg who had come here as a refugee asked me if we should not make a trip to Sweden and there we could meet one of his friends from Hamberg. In that way I met Goldstein. She is called , but the two middle things she did not like especially.  "

            "answer": "It is not a special love for birds, it is love of nature, but there are very few memories in Denmark and the insects are small but after all I have a collection of insects, but the main thing are the birds in a country like Denmark. There is much listening of birds and knowing their voices as recognizing them and seeing them. This is from the council in Europe at Strassburg. The church is one of the main figures. When the European movements started I went to the park and was a Danish member of the first European movement and what we demanded was a council for Europe that came later in Strassburg. My father was really against it and he called it the Church Party and aptly warned against it. As I often did my own things during the war, I went there and later were very eager to build. This is a picture of my father. He is much older of course, but more than usual. He was born in 1854 and he remembered the war in Germany in '64 when he was 10 years old when we lost a certain part of . He belonged to those people who found that the state should not play too great a role in people and families should decide for themselves. He was against what we call ; the people's church. Even the words, he called it and he was also against people going to school. People should choose whom they wanted to teach their children so it's a circle of people in my island where I had born had him as the teacher. At one time there were 65 children going to school in this unofficial school and only nine going in the official school. No person has had more importance for me than he and I think it's a very good thing when a son can say about his father that no person has meant more to him particularly.
