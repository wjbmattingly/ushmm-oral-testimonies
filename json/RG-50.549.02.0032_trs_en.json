            "answer": "When the war ended, I was in the vicinity of Dachau, near Munich, where I was liberated and met the American troops, who liberated me, actually. And I found out the creation of a Displaced Person camp, by the name of Feldifing, which I did not join. I had the accommodation in the village where I was liberated and after being separated with my -- with my brother and friend from the Jewish community, we felt lonesome and proceeded to look for some places in Munich, to settle for time beings.

            "answer": "Well, excuse me, you could see the chaos that started by the airplanes that started to b- bombard the vicinity where the train was moving and the railroad tracks and the train itself slowed down. And it was a wooded area and the troops liquidated their post, from the top of the railroad cars and it was sort of a chance to take, now or never. So that what we took and thank God, we were successful. And we were in the water there, where -- where we were confronted by some French prisoner of wars, who helped us by changing our prison uniforms. And then we were -- we hid in the woods and -- until we met the American troops, so, two or three d -- two or three days later, until the fighting finally stopped, and we sa -- went out from the woods onto the open streets and we were stopped by a American patrol, who took us to a POW camp and then we were interrogated, and set free.

And we had a hard time to the convince the -- the people, the soldiers that we are Jews, because they were -- believed that the -- all the Jews were killed. And we choder -- we showed them our numbers on the arm and then they still didn\u2019t believe it, and they ask us when the Jewish holidays are, which we knew and answered them and then they finally said yes, you know, and t-took us into the Jeep and drove us to headquarters, where we met the colonel, who instead -- interrogated us about the German troop movements and the camp, from Dachau itself, the location and the -- whatever we knew about the camp, we told them, which wasn\u2019t very much, because within the camp, we had no knowledge what was going on outside the camp. So we couldn\u2019t be, in that respect, any great help."

Those days it was word to mouth and it worked very good, I must say, because people were constantly on the move. Everybody was looking for somebody and traveling and moving and meeting. And everybody had the story to tell, and that\u2019s how we found out from people that we met, who told us about that particular camp and we pursued to find out who, if any of th -- our friends or acquaintances from the camp were in the -- in that particular camp. I was not in Dachau per se, in the main camp, but I was in a satellite camp, that we were transported in that particular train."

We were isolated from any news and from any friends or people of Jewish contact, and that\u2019s why my brother traveled into Munich, to see what is going on there and 0 -- upon his return, we waited a week or so and then we decided that it would be better for us to be where the Jewish population is, despite the fact that we could have had a very substantial German factory and property from the Nazi that was -- evacuated the house, which we occupied after his leaving."

And he took us into the marketplace and comma-commanded to meet the mayor from the town. And he met the mayor of the town in a short while and he instructed the mayor, without any doubt, that he has three Jewish survivors and they are not going to sleep on the street and to provide us with a comfortable home and food and all that. And as -- they gave an -- an -- an hour\u2019s time. And we waited an hour and then he came back and he said that he found a home for us which -- and he\u2019s going to take us there and give us a woman to care for us and provide us with anything that we want and need, which actually took place. After we took the house, we looked around, there were three bedrooms and we took all the beds, pillows and all that into one bed and for the first time in our life, we slept comfortable and warm, and it was the first time that we really slept in -- un-undescribable. Now, this house became the meeting point for the Jewish soldiers that were in that particular camp, the POW camp. There was also a detachment from the Israeli army there, as prisoner of war, who served as the English army. And I would say that it was -- it was a comfortable time that we spent there with these people who had an opportunity to meet us and they brought us army rations and it was quite remarkable."

They had no airplanes, the train was not going and it was only going with the help of the American army. So, we went to the DP camp, to the officer in charge and told him what we -- what we found out, that we need some help and to give us a note that the American army should help us and take us along whenever possible, which they did. But, there were trains going -- there was one train going in the morning in that direction where we had to go.

It -- Unbelievable, where people was -- was on the outside, hanging on, just to be on the train. So, my brother took that train and then he came into a town and he had to go through Czechoslovakia and into Poland, because that particular part used to be under Germany, but it was occupied by Poland. So, after a three day travel in all kind of ways, my brother finally reached the place where my father\u2019s supposed to be. So he came there and he found the address and he found the house and he found the apartment, and guess what? My father wasn\u2019t there any more.

And at that particular time, there was a note at the Joint Distribu-Distribution Committee that President Truman gave 20,000 visas to Displaced Persons.

We arrived in Bramer harbor, we found out that the ships are not going and we waited in Bramer harbor three months, until the sh -- the strike was settled, and in January third, I believe it was, 1947, we boarded the USS Ernie Pyle, which was a troop carrier ship, and proceeded on an eventful trip to the United States. The eventfulness was that it was a stormy -- very, very stormy voyage. For a week, we did not leave the berth. The ship was cordoned off with ropes. We could not move it, because that\u2019s how the ship was moving, up and down. And the captain took a side trip over, to avoid the storm, to get out of it, over Canada, which was worse, because it was very icy there. So, in all, the trip took us about 14 -- 14 days and we arrived here in- in New York, on January the 14th or 15th, 1947.  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.
