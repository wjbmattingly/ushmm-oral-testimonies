            "answer": "When the war ended, I was in the vicinity of Dachau, near Munich, where I was liberated and met the American troops, who liberated me, actually. And I found out the creation of a Displaced Person camp, by the name of Feldifing, which I did not join. I had the accommodation in the village where I was liberated and after being separated with my -- with my brother and friend from the Jewish community, we felt lonesome and proceeded to look for some places in Munich, to settle for time beings."

            "question": "Okay, so you were be -- you were being liquidated from Dachau on a train, you jumped off the train and how did you hear that American troops were coming? How did you realize that you were free?",
            "answer": "Well, excuse me, you could see the chaos that started by the airplanes that started to b- bombard the vicinity where the train was moving and the railroad tracks and the train itself slowed down. And it was a wooded area and the troops liquidated their post, from the top of the railroad cars and it was sort of a chance to take, now or never. So that what we took and thank God, we were successful. And we were in the water there, where -- where we were confronted by some French prisoner of wars, who helped us by changing our prison uniforms. And then we were -- we hid in the woods and -- until we met the American troops, so, two or three d -- two or three days later, until the fighting finally stopped, and we sa -- went out from the woods onto the open streets and we were stopped by a American patrol, who took us to a POW camp and then we were interrogated, and set free."

            "answer": "No, no, no, no, we\u2019re -- oh, you -- no, I\u2019m sorry, when we -- when we met them, we were in civil uniforms, that\u2019s correct, but we were recognized by the hat -- that we had no hair on -- it was shaved in a certain way that the prisoners were, by a -- sort of a center of the head, the street, that was left a little bald down to the skin and next to it, there were a little bit of hair, so it was recognizable as a street or a mark to be a prisoner. And we had a hard time to the convince the -- the people, the soldiers that we are Jews, because they were -- believed that the -- all the Jews were killed. And we choder -- we showed them our numbers on the arm and then they still didn\u2019t believe it, and they ask us when the Jewish holidays are, which we knew and answered them and then they finally said yes, you know, and t-took us into the Jeep and drove us to headquarters, where we met the colonel, who instead -- interrogated us about the German troop movements and the camp, from Dachau itself, the location and the -- whatever we knew about the camp, we told them, which wasn\u2019t very much, because within the camp, we had no knowledge what was going on outside the camp. So we couldn\u2019t be, in that respect, any great help."

            "answer": "Well, at first, like I said, they -- th-the patrol who met us was suspicious, and they had all the rights of being so. And then, when we were at the headquarters, the people warmed up towards us and they took us to the POW camp, which was nearby, and they ask us whether we will -- would like to stay in the POW camp, wh -- or whether we would like to have some private accommodations, which we naturally choose to be -- to have the private accommodations, because there was more -- better than the POW accommodation --"

            "question": "How did you get to the DP camp and -- and what was that --",
            "answer": "Well, we -- you know, it\u2019s a funny thing nowadays, in 1999, I would say, things are more electronically and -- equipped. Those days it was word to mouth and it worked very good, I must say, because people were constantly on the move. Everybody was looking for somebody and traveling and moving and meeting. And everybody had the story to tell, and that\u2019s how we found out from people that we met, who told us about that particular camp and we pursued to find out who, if any of th -- our friends or acquaintances from the camp were in the -- in that particular camp. I was not in Dachau per se, in the main camp, but I was in a satellite camp, that we were transported in that particular train."

            "num": 15,
            "question": "So it sounds like, for a period there, before you went to the DP camp, you and your brother were sort of on your own?",
            "answer": "That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. We were isolated from any news and from any friends or people of Jewish contact, and that\u2019s why my brother traveled into Munich, to see what is going on there and 0 -- upon his return, we waited a week or so and then we decided that it would be better for us to be where the Jewish population is, despite the fact that we could have had a very substantial German factory and property from the Nazi that was -- evacuated the house, which we occupied after his leaving."
        },

            "num": 16,
            "question": "Well, tell me about that. Wa -- This was after you\u2019d been interrogated? How did you end up where you did?",
            "answer": "Well, after we left the -- after we left the DP camp -- not the D -- the interrogation, see, and we were told -- we told the commander that we would like to be on our own, and not in the POW camp, he instructed the lieutenant to take care of us and to give us some accommodation. And he took us into the marketplace and comma-commanded to meet the mayor from the town. And he met the mayor of the town in a short while and he instructed the mayor, without any doubt, that he has three Jewish survivors and they are not going to sleep on the street and to provide us with a comfortable home and food and all that. And as -- they gave an -- an -- an hour\u2019s time. And we waited an hour and then he came back and he said that he found a home for us which -- and he\u2019s going to take us there and give us a woman to care for us and provide us with anything that we want and need, which actually took place. After we took the house, we looked around, there were three bedrooms and we took all the beds, pillows and all that into one bed and for the first time in our life, we slept comfortable and warm, and it was the first time that we really slept in -- un-undescribable. Now, this house became the meeting point for the Jewish soldiers that were in that particular camp, the POW camp. There was also a detachment from the Israeli army there, as prisoner of war, who served as the English army. And I would say that it was -- it was a comfortable time that we spent there with these people who had an opportunity to meet us and they brought us army rations and it was quite remarkable."

            "answer": "Well, it sust felt like -- like being newborn and you started your life over from the beginning and you met people, and you -- that you never figured you\u2019re going to meet again, and -- you know, and it was a camaraderie, it was -- unde-undescribable."

            "answer": "No, no, it was -- it was afte-after the war, there were na -- no German soldier\u2019s occupation visible. The American were in hundred percent control and all you can see is what -- what I knew were -- how -- how a camp, the concentration camp looked like, it didn\u2019t look like a concentration camp, but it looked like a camp and you know, one camp or the other, there\u2019s no -- not much -- any big difference. The only thing different was that they had bunks, which we didn\u2019t have in the camp, and they were treated different than we were, and there was -- there was a difference in the camp, in the treatment and the accommodations that they had in the POW camp than I had in -- in the concentration camp."

That means Jewish people who obtained preference of ser -- supervising the Jewish working force and -- and used their force by beating Jewish people as well as the Germans. And if they came and were recognized, they suffered the consequences."

            "answer": "Well, you know, if somebody came in there and the -- the -- and somebody recognized them, and people suffered under the -- under their treatment, they had now an opportunity to get even with them. So, to what extent I cannot describe, because sometimes they were brutal and sometimes they were not as brutal. So it -- it all depended upon the -- the force. It could have been two people, it could have been 10 people who -- who were together and suffered, you know, and they got even with them. But it was, in my opinion, the -- in my o -- in my opinion, legitimate and it was r-right to -- for the revenge. So, it didn\u2019t happen very often, so, you know, it is -- 1t is a matter of -- that the card -- the card have turned. You know, it is a -- a fact that the people never thought that they going to face the -- the facts, and the day of judgment came."

And th-the Jewish people met there, because it was a very large place where you could congregate. It was not within the traffic, it was out of the -- out of sight and that\u2019s where people met and it was known all over Europe. So even people from Italy and Poland, or whatever, you know, they heard about and that\u2019s -- if they looked for somebody, that\u2019s where they went to see and meet people. And that\u2019s where -- where these things happened, you know, and it didn\u2019t take much, because there were a lot of people there, to create the -- the -- you know, tumult.

            "answer": "Well, naturally they -- they -- everybody who gets attacked or something like this, always says something to defend themselve, but the -- the main issue was that they said, you know, \u201cWe were just prisoners like you and somebody had to do it, and we were selected, so we had to do it.\u201d But, you know, there\u2019s a difference, like the same thing with the Germans, that you can do something, and you can do it two ways. You can do it just to do it or you can put some personal hatred and force behind it and make it worse than it could be. And that is the issue and that\u2019s what they did, because the same thing the Germans, I mean, they we -- they were soldiers, but they were soldiers to defend themselves, but to go and put the personal atro-atrocity in the -- 1n -- in the -- in the movements, in the facts, that what killed so many people."

We didn\u2019t need any money because the food we needed to live on, we got from the soldiers and from the German, t -- who had to look for our well being, so that part, there was no -- no need for. We -- We got some shirts and dresses and all that from the POW, which at the time, one shirt was enough. We didn\u2019t live like -- like you live today, that you change your shirt every day. And our job for the time after the war, where there was nothing available and everything that we had was -- for us was appreciated and grateful, because we were in the camp, we had only one shirt on for months and months and months and we were full with -- with the lice and all that, so 1-1t was hundred percent improvement.

            "answer": "Well, we were very lucky, because in the POW camp, there was a doctor and he told us and warned us not -- not to eat too much and to overeat, because our stomach was not in -- in the condition to absorb a lot of foods and especially not any fat food. So we took that -- took it under advice and we contained ourselves to dairy products and -- and it worked, because -- well, it didn\u2019t work with me, but 1t worked, because I later on found out that I had -- have a peptic ulcer and when I came to the United States, I found it out and, you know, and -- but, by and large, a lot of people died after the war, from being fed by the English army, more food and fat food than they should have had. So there was a lot of people that died after the war, on account of the liberation and eating things that th- their stomach was not equipped to handle."

So, they said, \u201cWell, he\u2019s not going to come back, maybe he\u2019s dead,\u201d and so on, so on. But it was just after the war by hearsay and I don\u2019t know how it would have worked out once a nephew would have returned or something like that.

            "answer": "Well, it is a unique -- unique s-situation. You know, like I mentioned before, that word of mouth can work just as well as a radio or a tel -- not a te -- yeah, even television, but the only difference is that it takes longer and it is not instantly. My brother was going on the -- was at that museum and a person approached him that we knew from before the war, and said, \u201cWhat are you doing here? Your father is looking for you.\u201d And he was astonished and said, \u201cMy father is looking for me, and I am looking for him. So where -- where is he, where can I find him?\u201d So, he gave us the location where the village where my father was, where he met him and he spoke with him. So, the next day, my brother says -- not the next day, but the same day, my brother said, \u201cI\u2019m going to find Father and I\u2019m going to see what I can do to bring him here.\u201d So, at that particular time, there was no transportation yet available. They had no airplanes, the train was not going and it was only going with the help of the American army. So, we went to the DP camp, to the officer in charge and told him what we -- what we found out, that we need some help and to give us a note that the American army should help us and take us along whenever possible, which they did. But, there were trains going -- there was one train going in the morning in that direction where we had to go. So instead of standing in the street with the thumb, my brother took a train in the morning, for Munich, at six o\u2019clock. And people were hanging on on the train outside and inside and any -- any which way. You never seen a train with people like that -- was just like a Christmas tree. It -- Unbelievable, where people was -- was on the outside, hanging on, just to be on the train. So, my brother took that train and then he came into a town and he had to go through Czechoslovakia and into Poland, because that particular part used to be under Germany, but it was occupied by Poland. So, after a three day travel in all kind of ways, my brother finally reached the place where my father\u2019s supposed to be. So he came there and he found the address and he found the house and he found the apartment, and guess what? My father wasn\u2019t there any more. My father had left back to Berlin, because he figured that if we survived, we would go back to Berlin, where we originally are from. And he -- he came there and it was already three days that he was -- four days that he was gone, and there was no mail, there was no telephone to get in touch with me, to tell me what\u2019s going on. So he started on his way back, which also took about three days. And he finally arrived a week later, back, and I thought he would come back with my father and he said, \u201cGuess what? You know, I came there and there was there and Father was gone, he was in Berlin.\u201d So he said, now I should travel to Berlin to find him. I said, \u201cNo, you have the experience. You go and you travel to Berlin.\u201d So we waited a wee -- a week and -- til he got rested up [indecipherable] and then, about a week or 10 days later, he started out to th-the travel to Berlin and he met -- he traveled to Berlin, which also took him about three days or four days and he met my father in Berlin.

And he met him there and naturally the -- the joy was grateful and -- and my father was -- was very sick and it was a friend of his, woman friend, that knew him from before the war, and cared for him. And she went with him to Berlin. So, there was a big discussion about going to Munich and finally they decided to do it. And the transportation and the situation started to stabilize a little bit and we decided that -- to wait another month or so for them to come to Munich. So, he came back and then they waited a month or so and they started out to come and join us in Munich. And meanwhile, we got into a bigger apartment in Munich, and when they came, which was shortly after, we were ready for them and had the -- had the apartment and all that, so it was a nice welcome and to -- to see them after all these years.
