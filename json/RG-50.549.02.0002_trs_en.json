And amongst it was a, a request by the Truckmay (ph) family for me to contact the Quaker in the United States, that was very important because the Quakers had given their support to the Luchombon (ph) Pr oject and to, and Pastor Truckmay (ph) was entirely dependent on their financial help. And so that was one of the first things I did it, was to go to the New York Quaker office and they were very interested and they asked me to come to a meeting and they asked me to give a little talk on my experience and, and they, they were fascinated by what had happened to their USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0002 12 support, to hear about it from firsthand.

It, it didn\u2122t occur to me to mention it, I guess or I forgot. But just before we left France, somebody contacted me and asked me to distribute anti-Nazi literature. I must say today they give it a name but at that time, we didn\u2122t think of ourself, neither working for the Resistance or Underground, we, we, didn\u2122t occur to us to think in those terms. And they, and they, today they give this a name. And they call it a coolyay (ph) but I just was a young girl on the bicycle who distributed this literature. And, and I, I, I personally did it in the streets of Toulouse and it was very dangerous but I don\u2122t think it ever occurred to me to think that I did something dangerous. The only thing I knew was that I had to keep my mouth shut, never tell anybody what I was doing, not my parents, not my fri ends, nobody. It was zero. You had to do what you were asked to do without asking any questions. And I felt I was doing something important. And to leave that gave me this guilt feeling. And also, I, I had something very rare, a bicycle. And I wanted to leave it with this organization and so when we escaped from Fr ance to Spain and we were on the train, this train stopped in Toulouse and I had my bicycle with me, on the train and I suddenly jumped out of the trai n and it, I wanted to leave the bicycle at the station. And my father jumped after me and said , you crazy? I mean, he was right actually, it USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0002 15 was crazy. And he, he, he gave me a, a sl ap, he slapped me. And the stationmaster came and said, what are you doing? You slapping this young lady? You mustn\u2122t do that. And everybody was against my father and defended me. And so I told the stationmaster what I wanted to do, to leave the bicycle in Toulouse and he helped me. He gave me a, he put it where the baggage is and he gave me a little receipt and I sent the receipt to somebody whom I told to give it to this other person and today I know he never got it but, that\u2122s another story again. But anyway, I tried very hard and, and I also didn\u2122t want to leave Earnest (ph) because I was afraid he would not be taken care of was parcels. Those were the basis for my guilt feelings actually and it stayed with me when I came here. So one of the first things I did was, when it was founded, I went to the Free French Movement in New York. [end of side one, tape one] One of the first thi ngs I did was, when it was founded, I went to the Free French Movement in New York and wanted, and told them I wanted to join them. They, they recruited people to go to England and on, and I was told I was too young. But until now, I don\u2122t believe that was the real reason. At this particular point I think I must have run into somebody who was an anti-Semite and didn\u2122t want me to join them. "

            "answer": "Yes. We, the first thing was for him to, to me, to regain his self-esteem. He hadn\u2122t worked, he hadn\u2122t studied for all this time and I was concerned that he, he should be given every opportunity possible so, but we had no money and so the first concern was to, to have enough money to live independently. So he had to find a job and he took any old job, whatever it was, he didn\u2122t, a long series of short jobs that he accomplished in the first half-year of his stay in America and then we had enough money to, to rent a little apartment on mid-Manhattan. And actually apartment is a big name for a room and a kitchenette. And then he joined the, I was very concerned that he should go continue his studies and he, he went to the new school and he took a scholarship and he, he then wrote a thesis and then the thesis was sent to many colleges and universities so he could ask for scholarships. And he did receive a, several scholarships and he choose to go to Johns Hopkins. And that of course meant that we had to leave New York and that meant that I had to leave my job. I might say at this point, this is the story of my life. I had to leave my jobs whenever it just started to bloom, whenever the first blooms came out, I had to leave because my husband was transferred or for such reasons. And today, I know that many married couples split up because of this situation which doesn\u2122t allow the woman to continue her career. And, but at that time, there was no question. And so I went with Earnest to Baltimore and I got a job in the Veteran\u2122s Administration Hospital Library. And USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0002 26 that made me change to a specialization that I had then for quite awhile, which is medical librarianship which is a class, sort of, in itself. We settled in, in Sparrow\u2122s Point, it, it, and Earnest went to Baltimore every day and I went to my hospital library. And he started his Ph.D. in economics. He choose economics. And after awhile, I said Earnest, we have to start a family. This is, I\u2122m getting impatient about that. And so, he had to look for a job because he, he, he did get the scholarship and he did have a very, very small contribution for his teaching when he did, it was sort of a teaching scholarship. And he taught a few classes in Johns Hopkins, but was nothing one could live on. So he traveled to Washington and he actually got a job in Washington and we moved again. And as a matter of fact, I had taken, I had started to go to library school that summer in New York. I, I took off for a session of the summer school at Columbia University and took medical librarianship and my teacher there came from Washington and was chief of reference in the Armed Forces Medical Library which is the predecessor of the National Library of Medicine. And so when Earnest found his job in Washington, I went to see her and asked her if she would consider hiring me a nd as I had had an A in her course, she offered me a position in the reference library of the Armed Forces Medical Library which was located at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology which is the forerunner of the..."

His memoirs by the way, are not just on the Holocaust at all, his memoirs are about his entire life which includes his very happy childhood and after the war, his experience in foreign service.

There are very few USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0002 45 left and each time you talk about a subject, one or more details come up that have not come up before, which might be helpful in writi ng this history. As an example, I just learned two days ago about a happening that might be intere sting to mention in this connection. In, there was the, the big question in France was why the was the village of Leshombon (ph) spared and we never had really an answer and I don\u2122t think that there is an answer right now either that is hundred percent. But one of our colleagues was caught by the French police and put into a bus in order that he be transported into a camp or we didn\u2122t know where of course. And he was all of a sudden released. And of course he jumped from the bus and disappeared but the, we all had theories on why this had happened and his theory was is because he was so young, he was 12 years at the time. And the answer appeared two days ago, it wasn\u2122t at all because he was too young, because as we know now, very young children were brought into concentration camps. It was because the mayor of the city had written to Pitton (ph) saying that the children, the Jewish children of Leshombon (ph) have, are under the protection of the Swiss. Sicroa (ph) Swiss. And therefore cannot be touched. He had never received an answer but apparently this was noted by the authorities. They must have just of notified the police there and the little boy was left. This note, this letter by the mayor became known only very recently when the archives of the Red Cross, Swiss Red Cross was finally made available which was very recently. And I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0002 46 expect that such incidences will come up daily now that the archives of, of the former Soviet Union, the archives from all over the occupied countries where the German Gestapo was the government, are coming up now .
