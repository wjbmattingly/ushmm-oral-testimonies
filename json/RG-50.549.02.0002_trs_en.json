            "question": "Kay, stop for one second. Can you talk a little bit more about what the atmosphere was like in your home, when you were growing up. Do, how, I know your father was political and I don\u2019t know if that was true of the whole household. Can you talk a little about that?",
            "answer": "I was born and lived in the first four years of my life in Vienna, in a, comfortably apartment in Vienna\u2019s eighth district. My father\u2019s father was a lawyer and he had died a few months before my arrival. And it, my father was an editor at the newspaper and my mother managed the household. My parents loved music, people and discussions and they went out a lot, and, at, as well as having frequent get-together at their place. Their friends were writers and artists and the atmosphere at home was always very lively. My father worked at night so when he came home in the morning to sleep, I had to be very quiet. His paper appeared in the morning and, so he had to work all night. And they liked if I even left the house so I wouldn\u2019t disturb him. Before my father had, he had graduated from law school and this enabled him to be the newspaper\u2019s responsible editor. A position which required him to represent the newspaper in court whenever it was sued. He also, also specialized on reports relating to international subjects such as the League of Nations. As, as the world passed the period of economic depression, my father lost his position in 1927. He was appointed an editor to several publications in Berlin, and relocated his family to that city. I started going to elementary school in Berlin, Villmustof (ph), where we lived until 1933. And returned to Vienna after Hitler\u2019s victory. It was an, I went to an all-girls\u2019 school and we had religious instruction once a week. We were given bible instruction and we were encouraged to make plays (ph) about the lives of the characters in the Bible and, such as, for instance, Esther and Ruth. In Berlin, my father worked as and, responsible editor at the Montock-Morgan (ph) whose editor in chief was Leo , aS well as at the Togaboo (ph) and founded the economic review there . In 1931, he was sent on a reporter\u2019s trip around the world, visiting Russia, Manchuria, North China, Korea, Japan and the USA. There is a write-up about him in the New York Times, July the 5\" and from 1931 to 1933, he was co-editor in chief of the Daily . My mother disliked Berlin thoroughly, missing the charm of her daily existence. The social life was much reduced though we still had a lot of visits from family and friends. In March, 1933, we returned to Vienna, except for my father who wanted to finish some professional obligations, but was obliged to make a sudden departure when he escaped arrest by the Gestapo, May 1933. From then on, he was blacklisted as an opponent to the Nazi Regime."

But by no means directly because they, the ship tried to avoid the mine, the mines of the ocean and we went first to Cuba then to the Bermudas and finally, we ended up at Virginia Beach but we didn\u2019t know we were, where we were. We just ended up and the immigration officers came on board and processed us on board and then when finally we were allowed to leave the when they agreed, they were afraid that the boat contained spies and or, any other people they didn\u2019t wish to come on, to the United States.

I, I, now even more shocked than a person who hasn\u2019t experienced that at the necessity of writing the social security on everything you, you hand in now. Before when I arrived in the United States, you needed nothing, absolutely nothing. You gave your name, everybody believed you and if, if, if you, if they asked you do you have an identification and you took out an envelope from a letter that you got yesterday, that was sufficient.

And she was, she knew it, I think, about my background and she was very kind. And very helpful. She collected clothes that I needed but she didn\u2019t let me know that she gave it to me. She just, it appeared where I was sitting or she just gave, she never wanted to be thanked for it but I knew she must have been, she had collected it. And, and mostly marvelous clothes that I had never even had before, such beautiful clothes. And the, the co-student, my students, colleagues never asked me anything. And the fact that my English was very poor of course, was very noticeable and in fact, it was non-existent in, in the first few weeks. I learned fast but it, the first few weeks it was non-existent and so you tended to go, we had to eat at school, right? And so you tended to go and sit with children that you could talk with. So a little French table was sort of brought together with little refugees from Belgium and France and we got to know each other because of the language."

            "answer": "No, because it, I wasn\u2019t asked no. The only thing, where I talked about actually is when I left Europe I was given certain letters and documents by a variety of people to bring to the United States which I kept on me with great care. And amongst it was a, a request by the Truckmay (ph) family for me to contact the Quaker in the United States, that was very important because the Quakers had given their support to the Luchombon (ph) Project and to, and Pastor Truckmay (ph) was entirely dependent on their financial help. And so that was one of the first things I did it, was to go to the New York Quaker office and they were very interested and they asked me to come to a meeting and they asked me to give a little talk on my experience and, and they, they were fascinated by what had happened to their support, to hear about it from firsthand. And there\u2019s a little story, aside, 1s a lady came up to me and she said, would I agree to stay with her during the summer and be a companion to her daughter. And that was in springtime and so that seemed very far away and I agreed of course, yes I would. And then when I did spend time with that family in the summertime, what she really wanted me to do is to teach her child German. And to me, that was terrible. I didn\u2019t want to speak German. That was the language of the enemy. But I didn\u2019t want to disappoint her either. So I did teach the child German but it was, it was a great insight to my person, in a way. And I, I mention this because nobody would think of that, I don\u2019t think. You, you don\u2019t think you, this little girl speak, this not little, this young girl speaks German so why shouldn\u2019t she speak German with, I, I can understand her now very well but at that time, 1t made me very unhappy."

I must say today they give it a name but at that time, we didn\u2019t think of ourself, neither working for the Resistance or Underground, we, we, didn\u2019t occur to us to think in those terms. And they, and they, today they give this a name. And they call it a coolyay (ph) but I just was a young girl on the bicycle who distributed this literature. And, and I, I, I personally did it in the streets of Toulouse and it was very dangerous but I don\u2019t think it ever occurred to me to think that I did something dangerous. The only thing I knew was that I had to keep my mouth shut, never tell anybody what I was doing, not my parents, not my friends, nobody. It was zero. You had to do what you were asked to do without asking any questions. And I felt I was doing something important. And to leave that gave me this guilt feeling. And also, I, I had something very rare, a bicycle. And I wanted to leave it with this organization and so when we escaped from France to Spain and we were on the train, this train stopped in Toulouse and I had my bicycle with me, on the train and I suddenly jumped out of the train and it, I wanted to leave the bicycle at the station. And my father jumped after me and said, you crazy? I mean, he was right actually, it was crazy. And he, he, he gave me a, a slap, he slapped me. And the stationmaster came and said, what are you doing? You slapping this young lady? You mustn\u2019t do that. And everybody was against my father and defended me. And so I told the stationmaster what I wanted to do, to leave the bicycle in Toulouse and he helped me. He gave me a, he put it where the baggage is and he gave me a little receipt and I sent the receipt to somebody whom I told to give it to this other person and today I know he never got it but, that\u2019s another story again. But anyway, I tried very hard and, and I also didn\u2019t want to leave Earnest (ph) because I was afraid he would not be taken care of was parcels. Those were the basis for my guilt feelings actually and it stayed with me when I came here. So one of the first things I did was, when it was founded, I went to the Free French Movement in New York. [end of side one, tape one] One of the first things I did was, when it was founded, I went to the Free French Movement in New York and wanted, and told them I wanted to join them. They, they recruited people to go to England and on, and I was told I was too young. But until now, I don\u2019t believe that was the real reason. At this particular point I think I must have run into somebody who was an anti-Semite and didn\u2019t want me to join them. "

And, but the risks this man took. He was in danger every day of his, of his life while he worked tn, in Marseilles and to me, he, he, he did it out of idealism, out of the conviction that he had to save people. And he, he saved as many as he possibly could. And when he came back to the United States, the world had forgotten him. It\u2019s very sad, finally, when we came to the United States, my father wanted to write a biography of, of Varian Fry (ph) but he was not allowed to do it. He was told somebody else is writing it which, this biography has never came out, so, it was very sad. It was sad also for my father because he admired him and then finally, the, there was an exhibit about him and the United States Memorial Museum made an exhibit about Varian Fry and he\u2019s now being recognized and it, he, I think you will hear about him very shortly."

            "answer": "Yes. We, the first thing was for him to, to me, to regain his self-esteem. He hadn\u2019t worked, he hadn\u2019t studied for all this time and I was concerned that he, he should be given every opportunity possible so, but we had no money and so the first concern was to, to have enough money to live independently. So he had to find a job and he took any old job, whatever it was, he didn\u2019t, a long series of short jobs that he accomplished in the first half-year of his stay in America and then we had enough money to, to rent a little apartment on mid-Manhattan. And actually apartment is a big name for a room and a kitchenette. And then he joined the, I was very concerned that he should go continue his studies and he, he went to the new school and he took a scholarship and he, he then wrote a thesis and then the thesis was sent to many colleges and universities so he could ask for scholarships. And he did receive a, several scholarships and he choose to go to Johns Hopkins. And that of course meant that we had to leave New York and that meant that I had to leave my job. I might say at this point, this is the story of my life. I had to leave my jobs whenever it just started to bloom, whenever the first blooms came out, I had to leave because my husband was transferred or for such reasons. And today, I know that many married couples split up because of this situation which doesn\u2019t allow the woman to continue her career. And, but at that time, there was no question. And so I went with Earnest to Baltimore and I got a job in the Veteran\u2019s Administration Hospital Library. And that made me change to a specialization that I had then for quite awhile, which 1s medical librarianship which is a class, sort of, in itself. We settled in, in Sparrow\u2019s Point, it, it, and Earnest went to Baltimore every day and I went to my hospital library. And he started his Ph.D. in economics. He choose economics. And after awhile, I said Earnest, we have to start a family. This is, I\u2019m getting impatient about that. And so, he had to look for a job because he, he, he did get the scholarship and he did have a very, very small contribution for his teaching when he did, 1t was sort of a teaching scholarship. And he taught a few classes in Johns Hopkins, but was nothing one could live on. So he traveled to Washington and he actually got a job in Washington and we moved again. And as a matter of fact, I had taken, I had started to go to library school that summer in New York. I, I took off for a session of the summer school at Columbia University and took medical librarianship and my teacher there came from Washington and was chief of reference in the Armed Forces Medical Library which is the predecessor of the National Library of Medicine. And so when Earnest found his job in Washington, I went to see her and asked her if she would consider hiring me and as I had had an A in her course, she offered me a position in the reference library of the Armed Forces Medical Library which was located at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology which is the forerunner of the..."

In, to answer your question, what do you tell your little girl about the country she\u2019s just about to go to school in? And that was very difficult. We lived, when we came to Germany, this, the, there was a whole compound in Bonn. We were attached to the embassy, right?

And you, we, we talked about before we started recording that, for a long time you didn\u2019t talk, you didn\u2019t discuss it much, you didn\u2019t talk to other people and talk publicly and now, and now you do.

His memoirs by the way, are not just on the Holocaust at all, his memoirs are about his entire life which includes his very happy childhood and after the war, his experience in foreign service. But of course, in the middle of these happy stories, is his experience of Auschwitz and he is extremely interested anything that relates to the Holocaust and its origin. And so we, we come very interested in the entire question of why the question of anti-Semitism and the history of anti-Semitism and in particularly the history of anti-Semitism in Germany and Austria and in France. And that\u2019s a very vast subject if you really want to get knowledgeable about it. The, it also refers you to things that have not disappeared and are, are, are reappearing in our days now. We have a very strong nationalistic party in every one of these countries, especially in France and in Austria, which is frightening. "

            "answer": "Yes, because we are dying out. The people who can testify. There are very few left and each time you talk about a subject, one or more details come up that have not come up before, which might be helpful in writing this history. As an example, I just learned two days ago about a happening that might be interesting to mention in this connection. In, there was the, the big question in France was why the was the village of Leshombon (ph) spared and we never had really an answer and I don\u2019t think that there is an answer right now either that is hundred percent. But one of our colleagues was caught by the French police and put into a bus in order that he be transported into a camp or we didn\u2019t know where of course. And he was all of a sudden released. And of course he jumped from the bus and disappeared but the, we all had theories on why this had happened and his theory was is because he was so young, he was 12 years at the time. And the answer appeared two days ago, it wasn\u2019t at all because he was too young, because as we know now, very young children were brought into concentration camps. It was because the mayor of the city had written to Pitton (ph) saying that the children, the Jewish children of Leshombon (ph) have, are under the protection of the Swiss. Sicroa (ph) Swiss. And therefore cannot be touched. He had never received an answer but apparently this was noted by the authorities. They must have just of notified the police there and the little boy was left. This note, this letter by the mayor became known only very recently when the archives of the Red Cross, Swiss Red Cross was finally made available which was very recently. And I expect that such incidences will come up daily now that the archives of, of the former Soviet Union, the archives from all over the occupied countries where the German Gestapo was the government, are coming up now. And they had been hidden before."
