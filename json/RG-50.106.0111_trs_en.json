            "answer": "Well, I really couldn\u2122t support myself because I knew very little English, like please and thank you, good morning and some [indecipherable] . My husband, who was a physician and knew English and some other la nguages, got a job in Casualty Hospital in Washington, D.C. driving the ambulance, and he got 50 dollars a month and room and board. So with 50 dollars a month my little girl and I stayed an apartment house where he paid 12 dollar a week. So that\u2122s \u0152 because we could not \u0152 the only thing we could take with us was eight dollars per person. We had 24 dollars with us. So that th \u0152 took a long time til we were able to \u0152 even to move into a room and s \u0152 and use kitchen facilities. But you know, we \u0152 it somehow, with this Holocaust survivors, I think most of us did not expect that the government or different places will take care of us. So it was a very difficult time and my little girl and I went to Americanization school to learn English. And we met a lot of other refugees and came through France with some of them. And little by little we got to know some of the physicians and we were in-invited a lot, and it was very difficult. If you don\u2122t \u0152 if you don\u2122t \u0152 can\u2122t reciprocate, you feel rather badly about. And we came to visit one of the doctors, and the doct or\u2122s wife said, oh, go up the steps, on the bedroom you put your coat on, and the bath room is there. So I looked at myself, I said, what\u2122s wrong with me, you know, is my petticoat hanging out, how do I look? But sh \u0152 sh \u0152 I didn't realize that pe ople want to make you comfortable, as you know where the bathroom is, or where you can put yo ur coat. Th-This is some Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 6of the things which are not done in \u0152 in Vienna, or \u0152 or in Austria in a certain class, you know, so \u0152 so there were many, many things. It took a long time to be comfortable, to ask somebody. Now I will ask, oh, you have a lovely bag. If you\u2122re finished with it, you don\u2122t it, give it to me. Or I go \u0152 I dr \u0152 I dro \u0152 drove by, and \u0152 some friend, three in the afternoon and I was hungry and I would visit a friend and I s \u0152 and I \u0152 I said, Jean, I\u2122m so hungry, what do you have in your refrigerator? But I had a Visa, I could si \u0152 and I had some dollar bills, and I could buy something, but it \u0152 it \u0152 it was different now, that I could ask people to do or give me something. But when we first came it was very depressing to have to ask. We went in New York to try to get sponsors for some family in France and it was in August, in September, it was very, very hot. And when we walked into somebody\u2122s and they offered a glass of water, as you did right now, we said no thank you. We didn\u2122t even want to accept a glass of water, we felt so \u0152 s-so bad about ourself that we couldn\u2122t [indecipherable] . So it was very wonderful that so many people gave affidavits. They didn't even know the family, or they didn\u2122t \u0152 they had the s-same name or something, you know, and \u0152 and it was really wonderful the way, particularly the very poor Jews in \u0152 the poorer class, you know. Of course, they had to have a certain income, or a t-tax return to show that they would be able to \u0152 to support or \u0152 or help \u0152 help the people. So it was a very di-difficult time."

            "answer": "No. The pi \u0152 the peop \u0152 some knew Vienna or Austria from \u0152 from visiting there or from movies and so on. People were not so \u0152 so interested in \u0152 in what had happened, and a \u0152 it was very little known, you know. Even we didn\u2122t know too much about. We were very fortunate to leave \u0152 Hitler marched in on the 13th of March, and we were very fortunate to leave the beginning of July, you know. So \u0152 but my husband had, as a physician, really terrible experiences. He could not treat Jewish people at all, or \u0152 or in \u0152 not \u0152 he couldn\u2122t, not Jewish, Gentile people, but Jewish people he could treat. And he woul d get phone calls from the family that the husband was taken to concentration camp, Dachau, Buchenwald. On \u0152 on the following week she received a \u0152 at \u0152 not a fa \u0152 didn\u2122t have faxes that time, a telegram that her husband had died on pn eumonia and they have \u0152 she would get the ashes back. So he knew all these and he was very, very depressed, but it was very difficult for him to get ready to leave, much more somehow than it was for me. You know, and I felt for a longest, longest time until we had the first interview that Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 8you did, I felt very guilty that I, my family, we were able to escape and \u0152 here, and I was able, you know, the education that I \u0152 that I have to make a success, and so did my husband here, and here my family and \u0152 and friends lost their \u0152 their life, and \u0152 and so I \u0152 I felt very, very guilty. But now, since that \u0152 it has changed my attitude since that interview and also I did not realize that I \u0152 that I am considered a Holocaust survivor. I didn\u2122t \u0152 never, neve r occurred to me to be in the same category. But now I feel that I have a voice, I can do something and I\u2122m very fortunate that I have that Montessori education, or early ch ildhood education that I was doing so much in the United States, was very successful. I got the gold medal for my work in America for the \u0152 in Montessori. I got [indecipherable] what do you call it, gold medal from the \u0152 from the embas \u0152 from Austria. I got my citizenship back, and I have a voice. Being angry, it \u0152 it does not help. So I feel now that since the \u0152 all my writing, I have written about 18 \u0152 not \u0152 not high class and not people who made the best seller list, but they helped the people, the poor people that I worked in Mississippi to write and be able to vo \u0152 to vote."

I \u0152 I would like you to tell me how you began your professional career, and I\u2122d like you to explain about your background with Montessori. I-I would like you to take your time and do that very slowly, from the beginning, please. Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 9",
            "answer": "Well, w-w \u0152 in Vienna, you know, after the first World War, we began to ask ourselves, what is wrong with education, what has to be done? And we were young people and so we wanted to change the world. So Montessori was brought, she was a physician from Italy and she brought the Montessori method to Vienna. So we all ran to these lectures and got a \u0152 a book that sh \u0152 the first book she wrote and so on. And you had, in Vienna you had to do first your exam as a kindergarten teacher, you know, and then you could specialize in [indecipherable] in Montessori. So I took the \u0152 the training, then when I got married, I opened up a kindergarten, and I \u0152 cause I had the middle or the upper middle class children. I did not have the poor \u0152 the poor ones as I really had here in America. So na \u0152 when I first came, it took a long time til I learned enough English to take some of the tests that were necessary to establish myself. And at that time was the English word against the English [indecipherable] that\u2122s what the \u0152 some of \u0152 of the newcomers have to learn, you know, that you have to know the language in order to be political active or \u0152 or \u0152 or \u0152 or have a job and [indecipherable] thing. So first I got different jobs in special education, because at that time in the early sh \u0152 the special education was on the lower bottom of the education. So \u0152 so when I applied they were happy to \u0152 to get me to take care of the special class children. And then they were very surprised the big success, because I was bootlegging Montessori. I made a lot of material, I use that method of Montessori, and so the supervisor, she used Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 10to bring teachers or students to observe in my \u0152 in my classes and so on, to see what I\u2122m doing."

Montessori was here in the early \u0152 1913 she wa \u0152 she was here, and there were schools and by 1918 when the war \u0152 when the first World War start, these schools were all closed.

            "question": "If you could just give a little bit of an idea for someone who does not know about Montessori.",
            "answer": "Okay. For one thing, it\u2122s a different layout of a classroom. Children are \u0152 are not expected because they\u2122re six years old that they be reading, or three years old. We don\u2122t \u0152 we \u0152 in a classroom we have ch ildren from three to six, for instance, because a three year old one might be able to read, or a four year old one, but unable to kick a ball or something than a si x year one. So they\u2122re \u0152 it\u2122s a such \u0152 like in a family. We do a different classroom arrangement. So we don\u2122t have this is the class two years old, or four year one, we have them \u0152 we have now infants\u2122 classes too, you know. So this is one of the things. And also that th-there are certain rules and \u0152 and regulations in a Montessori classroom and people in th \u0152 it has to work like a \u0152 like a society. You can \u0152 I mean, you have to show them, for instance, how Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 11to open a door and close a door. How to lift a chair and put it down. And how \u0152 and if you play with something, that y \u0152 I cann ot come and say, this I want to play now with it. So, he learns that he has to ask. We have little rugs for the children, and they put their toys on that rug, and this is his territory. So they have to learn territorial rights. It\u2122s laid out the way, like a library with the books and stuff. You just can\u2122t take out a book and then, oh, I want to read the book. We have to return it to there, and th-th-then next child can. So that the \u0152 he learns in \u0152 the way a classroom and the way the whole thing is handled, he lear ns the rules for society. So, th-this is a very im \u0152 important, and the different exp ectations for the parents too, to \u0152 to understand that, you know? And the teac her is not called a teacher, she is a directress, she directs activities. She doesn\u2122t sit at her desk and the children come in, she has to be like a hostess, stand at the door, greet the children. And as she greets them, says Esther, you have a lovely dress and your hair is done so nice. Oh, and you have such a doll. And Esther says, oh my grandma came and she brought me that doll. So you know from that, that the child will want to walk around the classroom, show the doll to her. She doesn\u2122t want to disturb. And then there comes Jim, and Jim is so sad. So he said, you know, teach \u0152 some didn\u2122t know, you know, very much. He said, you know, the police ca me and \u0152 and took my ha \u0152 my father to jail. Then you know that this child needs help, somebody to help him to deal with it. And so that your aid spends a lot of time because otherwise he\u2122s gonna run Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 12around, disturbing and kn ocking things over [indecipherable] knocking things over. He \u0152 somehow he has to deal with it, but then you assign somebody to help him, hold his hand, take him around and so on. So that Montessori said like a hostess. If she greets the people at the door and says, oh, Mrs. Finder, you have a lovely dress today, and \u0152 and then you tell [indecipherable] or your husband to go and get yourself a drink. You don\u2122t talk to her the rest of your party, but she will come home and she says, you know, Mrs. Finder saw what a beautiful dress I had, you know. So the same way children know they \u0152 they were recognized, and that you knew dealing with their pr oblems or \u0152 and also, this teaches sort of manners to the children, to greet people in the morning. Some people talking \u0152 were critical when I talked at one of the university, I had some black students, teachers. And he said, oh yes, you come from a country, ki -kings and queens and you shake hands and you do all these nice things. But it\u2122s a \u0152 a very important thing to be nice, and so on. And so we do a lot training and what you call practical life. And under that comes also the manners and behavior. And what is father of the cons \u0152 of the \u0152 the president, the first president, we had? George Washington. When he was 15 years old, he wrote a book on manners that is \u0152 can be had. Now, we have \u0152 \ufb01 The Washington Post\ufb02 has a columnist and she wrote just recently a very great book on manners, the ya \u0152 and once I said, like lubri cation of your wheels. At that time very Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 13few people have cars, you know. But so she had a different \u0152 so these are some of the things that were \u0152 we were teaching.

So I went to Mississippi to work with poor mothers and \u0152 and poor children. The \u0152 most of the southerners are Baptists, so \u0152 and so we had \u0152 the daycare centers that we opened for the War on Poverty was in Baptist churches. We could not bring kindergarten t eachers in, or \u0152 because they don\u2122t want to have jobs and such. So we t-tried to train the people who lived there. I worked in Naches, Mississippi, was my first assignment, and at that time, Governor Bell did not \u0152 he was the governor of Mississippi and he did not want the \u0152 the money assigned for the president to use it. We came under a different, other th-thing. And it was very, very difficult to \u0152 to teach these mothers how they could read themselves. I had to teach the mothers reading and writing and show them on a Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 14somewhat basically they could \u0152 I did not know that I\u2122m all of a sudden a political worker because I helped these mothers, and some of their husbands would come in too, to learn to read and write so they could do the \u0152 an-and johns \u0152 not Johnson , the Kennedys used to come on weekends and help.

So, they looked and they l \u0152 and since Montessori was the first woman who was asked to come to the \u0152 when the war was over in 1918, to the first conference in peace, and she wrote a little Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 16booklet, Peace and Education , and she was very concerned about the peace, you know. So we looked \u0152 and then I went to England for awhile to take a \u0152 a training course, and I went to different places in \u0152 in \u0152 in Europe, you know, for retraining. In the beginning we got a lot of teachers from India, because Montessori was, for 10 years she was in India, because she was Italian citizen and she would not follow \u0152 what was the name in \u0152 I forgot his name . What? Yeah, mo \u0152 and then she went to \u0152 to Spain , and then she had \u0152 she would not follow [indecipherable] the directions of, what was his name [indecipherable] .

He was for non-violence for adults and she non-violence for children. At that time, as we see and hear it now in the newspapers and ra dio, the children were just suffering. Perhaps not as much, but they were \u0152 they \u0152 and when they were eight years old they went to mines to work and so on. So, you see, she was very, very involved in \u0152 in \u0152 in peace movement. And so, this is very important for us in \u0152 and to do this, and that\u2122s why I am so happy that my materials and all that is going to Vienna, yet, Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 17w-we \u0152 we paid a [indecipherable] we\u2122ll be able to do something towards peace, and also that the university, they realize here is a Holocaust survivor and what he did with that method, you know, they will know something, cause a lot of materials and stuff, I\u2122m working with these Holocaust interns at the museum, they\u2122re from Austria. It\u2122s the fourth one or fifth one that I am working, we worked on different things, with the Montessori method and others, how it ca n be. So that I feel now that, of the end of my life, I feel, as Montessori said, in the service of the child, that that will go on. And, but it also \u0152 it will be a separate room where all the materials and books are being \u0152 and films and [indecipherable] si \u0152 si \u0152 many books, because textbooks are so much written for the upper middle class. Or they are tested on the university, on the professor\u2122s childre n. But there aren\u2122t books and materials for the children who don\u2122t have that back ground and don\u2122t go to the museums and all that business."

            "question": "How did this project of, you know, with your collection being sent to Austria, how did this develop? Where did it begin?",
            "answer": "Two year ago, a \u0152 a professor and \u0152 and journalist and so on from Graz, you know, in Austria, came, she \u0152 to the United States at the Library of Congress. And she had heard me speak, and when \u0152 when the biography was published and I was there to promote it. She heard me speak, but she could not come up to \u0152 there were so many people in line, she had to leave. So when she came for research she called me, and she would like to see me. So I inv ited her for lunch, and we became friend, and she was the one who sort of said, lis \u0152 it would be a good idea if you would get to know a-and get your ma terial to know in v \u0152 in Vienna. So she sort of started, and I was thinking about it, but I really did not realize it\u2122s gonna be such a big project. So, let\u2122s see. Last year, the \u0152 the Austrian embassy gave me the \u0152 the gold medal for the work that I did because I worked a lot with these Holocaust interns, took them to some of the Jewish places, I had them for Jewish holidays because they have to learn to know how we\u2122re celebrating them. And also, I \u0152 on all \u0152 on all Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 21the holidays, I \u0152 I invite them here to a little meal, my family and friends, and then I invite one or two with \u0152 of the Holocaust, or non-Jewish people to come. And I don\u2122t want the people to bring me fl owers or candy. Everybody has to write something about that holiday. So, even these Holocaust survivors have written very interesting things, and I\u2122ve taken them to the Temple Sinai to some \u0152 so the-they learning a lot of \u0152 of Jewish life, to \u0152 and to understand. And [indecipherable] in my family I have a lot, and two of my gr anddaughters are married to non-Jews too, you know. So I\u2122m very inte rested of this understanding, you know. So, I don\u2122t know, cause a lot of people come, when th ey come to the Holocaust Museum, they come to visit me too, and I \u0152 I lived in different things [indecipherable] . But anyway, I don\u2122t know exactly, but all of a sudden th \u0152 told the \u0152 one of the attach\u00e9s that I think maybe I have so many books, perhaps they would be interested in Vienna to get it. So he asked me, and he made sort of a te mporary list and send it to Vienna. And they were very happy, and so th ey have already 14 boxes, and that\u2122s just with books and then films, and vi deos and I have hundreds of beautiful photography of the poor people in Mississippi and in New England, and different places, and it \u0152 it opens the world to the people here and in Vienna too, because they \u0152 they only think America is you know, the \u0152 the rich country, you know, it \u0152 on the Fifth Avenue, or Madison Avenue, whatever they see. So that \u0152 I\u2122m taking that movie attitude away from other people. So we started, and I looked for Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 22somebody to help with the packing, and I got this young libra rian at Catholic University who is very interested, and when he\u2122s off he comes and works a few hours and packs a thing.

            "answer": "Well, I \u0152 a lot of people in Montessori knew me and some people got involved in \u0152 in these different issues and \u0152 in America . And I got a phone call one day, would I come to Mississippi and introduce a little bit of Montessori? So I went down, and at that time in Mississippi there were different [indecipherable] Montessori, some people were from other universities with specialties in \u0152 in \u0152 in their field. So, what \u0152 we were hired by the, I th-think one of the Kennedy\u2122s brother-in-law, I don\u2122t know, he was in ch arge. Anyway, we were paid. So we got to Mississippi , and my husband, and we felt th is is an opportunity to repay something to America. And when I got to Naches, Mississippi , I \u0152 I \u0152 one of the in \u0152 newspapers came down for an interview, one of the Catholic paper. And \u0152 a-and in there I didn't even remember, but in there I had said I felt when in Mississippi that I\u2122m back in \u0152 under Hitler, you know, the way things were going. And then to come to my hats. I wore hats because I can\u2122t always comb my hair so well. So I wore hats, and I have different hats. And the Ku Klux Klan was very much behind Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 23me, they didn't want us to come in to teach the blacks. But I heard from somebody who was friends with the Ku Klux Klan too, said we can\u2122t take \u0152 we don\u2122t \u0152 Hitler didn\u2122t want that little Jewish woman, we can\u2122t do it either, because everybody knows her by her hats.

And there is a \u0152 a place here in the United States, they have only \u0152 a \u0152 a woman has a shop only with hats. I shouldn\u2122t nor \u0152 need to go there, and see what I don\u2122t have. S-So \u0152 but I didn\u2122t stay the whole time, you see, in Mississippi, I did work and to train them, and I would fly back to Washington , then go down again for a week. And so it wasn\u2122t that I continuously stayed there. But you see, my teaching and \u0152 and the politic was \u0152 was one thing. Because like I worked in Naches with the poor people who didn't know how to read, an-and \u0152 and Charles Evers , he was \u0152 he was from Naches too, and he was running for an office . So he \u0152 sometimes I was up here with him, you know, on \u0152 when he \u0152 when he was \u0152 spoke somewhere, or we have catfish, or [indecipherable] and stuff. So that \u0152 you know, so I \u0152 I appeared and I was some help, you know, the [indecipherable] thing, and he was elected not because just of me [indecipherable] . But I was then at the \u0152 what\u2122s the city, the Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 24capital city, when he was elected. But we did not \u0152 our checks came from a different group, not from \u0152 from the state of Mississippi, you know. So many, many things I somehow adopted that Montessori method and I have to rewrite a lot to understand their backgrounds and their needs and so on. And it was very difficult in the beginning because these mothers wouldn't sleep or clean up. They said, oh don\u2122t I know that they don\u2122t have to do these slave type work? And I said, you know, but still, you know, we have to clean up. An d then I called the \u0152 here the national gallery of art and ask the cur \u0152 one of the curators in education, could he send me some paintings that glorify work? And he did. And so we hung it in the different classrooms, and so they \u0152 the \ufb01Girl with a Broom\ufb02 by Rembrandt, they realized now the \u0152 somehow, without having ever been to a museum, they knew that paintings are something very precious. And \u0152 and [indecipherable] and different paintings and we had it in the classroom s. And i-it \u0152 during that time, War on Poverty, they were, you know, the se-senators and congressmen and people would come to Mississippi and they would come to visit these centers. And \u0152 and we \u0152 I taught them the names of these paintings and \u0152 on the \u0152 and so when these pa \u0152 people came, and these pro-professors a nd so, and painting, and \u0152 and she could say, oh this is, the name of the painting, say something. All of a sudden that little black woman without any art education was at the same level as the senator or the Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 25[indecipherable] and she knew. So the arts plays a stellar role too, in the many things that I have done in the art."

For instance, in Vienna when I was going in stores that belong ed to some of Jewish people, I didn't have look. I had braids, and \u0152 and a \u0152 they would say, fr\u00e4ulein, you can\u2122t go into that, the Nazis would tell me you can\u2122t go into the store, because they thought I \u0152 y you know, that\u2122s only for Jewish people, you know. And we could not be out at \u0152 very late in the evening, and you couldn\u2122t go into \u0152 to a movie, or you couldn\u2122t \u0152 and it was the same thing, because the blacks, you could go only on the \u0152 some of the gallery [indecipherable] . And they couldn\u2122t sit in a \u0152 a restaurant. I mean, the things that were done to us in \u0152 in \u0152 under Hitler, these conditions existed there. So Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 26I was able, you know, and then I wo rked with \u0152 with others, not only Mississippi , with other states, flying in, and I wrote papers and I wrote little pamphlets and different things to help the people to \u0152 to learn.

            "answer": "A f \u0152 a few friends and I have organized a little German club, and so we meeting once \u0152 once a month. And one day a Mrs. Schroeder came, and she is a journalist and so is her husband. And she came to th e German club and said, I know I don\u2122t Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 30need to learn German, however I want to know what makes you guys get together and speak German, you know. And somehow, after a year or so she was there \u0152 she asks her husband, and she asked me did I want to do a book, because from what I was saying at the club, or somehow she thou ght that I have \u0152 we \u0152 I had a story to tell. So we did. So it was a \u0152 quite a decision, and also you know, I did not \u0152 I hadn\u2122t planned, you know, and \u0152 and a lot of dates and stuff like you are asking me. I\u2122m a \u0152 mathematics wasn\u2122t my strong forte. So, it was v-very difficult, but as a journalist, I mean like he went to \u0152 they went to Vienna when they were doing the \u0152 and they found the coffee shop where I went to, and they found the schools I went to, and they brought photographs and \u0152 and they got i-in \u0152 Austria pu-published every year, every month what\u2122s happening and every day. So he found the 1905, what in July, had happened , you know. And there were similar things being \u0152 we will want now [indecipherable] that. And some from newspaper they were \u0152 I have an awful lot of newspaper clippings, cause wherever I was, somehow there was an interview on \u0152 in some newspapers, so \u0152 we could establish some days where I went or what I did, you know, from the newspape r clippings. But this \u0152 my memory is not so \u0152 so good any more. In particular for dates. But, as I say, what \u0152 they were able, you know, to search through newspapers, and si \u0152 and there are some books and there\u2122s a chapter or something about me said in \u0152 in there, on the War on Poverty people who wrote books, so in se veral books was something about me or Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 31my work, you know, so \u0152 so that\u2122s how it came. It took a long time, and \u0152 but unfortunately it isn\u2122t translated into English yet. That bothers my grandchildren because they never learned any German because my daughter was so \u0152 she would not want to have her children on Hitler\u2122s language. So \u0152 so the \u0152 course there\u2122s not enough on Montessori in there, and \u0152 well, you can\u2122t di \u0152 you know, write so much when you live a long life as I did, and \u0152 but I was so fortunate as a title, it \u0152 the book, I was very lucky that what I did, it was a success, you know. And had some \u0152 everybody lives a life and has some sad things, but c\u2122est la vie, and it doesn\u2122t have to \u0152 just to sit and \u0152 and feel sorry for oneself, that I lost my daughter and I had to take care of my grandchildren. But I\u2122m ve ry lucky, they all did not go on drugs, they finished their education, they are married, they have children and they are working and I can be very happy with th at. And that my work that I did is successful \u0152 was very successful in that it\u2122s a \u0152 a [indecipherable] and we\u2122ll find a place and I feel in a way it will constantly remind people when they go there to visit, that this Jewish woman was a Holocaust \u0152 what the Holocaust room, even if they will not have everybody\u2122s name, but somehow I feel with the videos and with th-the \u0152 everything is going to be there, that it will be some \u0152 in paying something back that I did not suffer. But I feel it \u0152 that the work that I have done that is being \u0152 being used, it will tell the story of these people that I did not know and that had to suffer and \u0152 and die such a terrible death. So I feel that really I have to be grateful Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 32particular to Spielberg that his first video that made me feel I have some spot in that history and I have done something with my life, and that I have in some way, is \u0152 is \u0152 I wanted to dedicate this memorial to these people that \u0152 that I don\u2122t know, and some names I know. But I always wanted when they were talking about a stone wall with the names, the people in Vienna have such magnifi cent buildings and museums.

So there\u2122s some of the things that we are teaching the young children would be very helpful to \u0152 as a matter of fact, I\u2122m meeting in a couple days , somebody is coming with student rep \u0152 Interview with Lena Gitter July 21, 1998 43research and so I \u0152 I don\u2122t know, I always get involved in to something, that\u2122s easy. I don\u2122t have to plan it, I have the time."

I would like to \u0152 the \u0152 as I say, there\u2122s some of these things that we more \u0152 more covered, and mo re \u0152 it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s nice that the museum and all that, but the educational department, I th ink, should be in \u0152 more en-enlarged, some more money has to go to \u0152 towards the education, I think it\u2122s \u0152 that\u2122s my criticism for the Holocaust Museum. But all the volunteers in my family, they are hooked on that. The \u0152 the days they \u0152 they go there and th ey \u0152 they don\u2122t want to miss it, it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s a wonderful [indecipherable]. Well, thank you for giving me an opportunity to \u0152 to speak, but it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s just too \u0152 too much for me to cover now."
