            "answer": "Well, I really couldn\u2019t support myself because I knew very little English, like please and thank you, good morning and some [indecipherable]. My husband, who was a physician and knew English and some other languages, got a job in Casualty Hospital in Washington, D.C. driving the ambulance, and he got 50 dollars a month and room and board. So with 50 dollars a month my little girl and I stayed an apartment house where he paid 12 dollar a week. So that\u2019s \u2014 because we could not \u2014 the only thing we could take with us was eight dollars per person. We had 24 dollars with us. So that th \u2014 took a long time til we were able to \u2014 even to move into a room and s \u2014 and use kitchen facilities. But you know, we \u2014 it somehow, with this Holocaust survivors, I think most of us did not expect that the government or different places will take care of us. So it was a very difficult time and my little girl and I went to Americanization school to learn English. And we met a lot of other refugees and came through France with some of them. And little by little we got to know some of the physicians and we were 1n-invited a lot, and it was very difficult. If you don\u2019t \u2014 if you don\u2019t \u2014 can\u2019t reciprocate, you feel rather badly about. And we came to visit one of the doctors, and the doctor\u2019s wife said, oh, go up the steps, on the bedroom you put your coat on, and the bathroom is there. So I looked at myself, I said, what\u2019s wrong with me, you know, is my petticoat hanging out, how do I look? But sh \u2014 sh \u2014I didn't realize that people want to make you comfortable, as you know where the bathroom is, or where you can put your coat. Th-This is some Interview with Lena Gitter \u00b0 July 21, 1998 of the things which are not done in \u2014 in Vienna, or \u2014 or in Austria in a certain class, you know, so \u2014 so there were many, many things. It took a long time to be comfortable, to ask somebody. Now I will ask, oh, you have a lovely bag. If you\u2019re finished with it, you don\u2019t it, give it to me. Or I go \u2014 I dr \u2014I dro \u2014 drove by, and \u2014 some friend, three in the afternoon and I was hungry and I would visit a friend and I s\u2014 and I-\u2014I said, Jean, I\u2019m so hungry, what do you have in your refrigerator? But I had a Visa, I could si\u2014 and I had some dollar bills, and I could buy something, but it \u2014 it \u2014 it was different now, that I could ask people to do or give me something. But when we first came it was very depressing to have to ask. We went in New York to try to get sponsors for some family in France and it was in August, in September, it was very, very hot. And when we walked into somebody\u2019s and they offered a glass of water, as you did right now, we said no thank you. We didn\u2019t even want to accept a glass of water, we felt so \u2014 s-so bad about ourself that we couldn\u2019t [indecipherable]. So it was very wonderful that so many people gave affidavits. They didn't even know the family, or they didn\u2019t \u2014 they had the s-same name or something, you know, and \u2014 and it was really wonderful the way, particularly the very poor Jews in \u2014 the poorer class, you know. Of course, they had to have a certain income, or a t-tax return to show that they would be able to \u2014 to support or \u2014 or help \u2014 help the people. So it was a very di-difficult time."

            "answer": "No. The pi \u2014 the peop \u2014 some knew Vienna or Austria from \u2014 from visiting there or from movies and so on. People were not so \u2014 so interested in \u2014 in what had happened, and a \u2014 it was very little known, you know. Even we didn\u2019t know too much about. We were very fortunate to leave \u2014 Hitler marched in on the 13\" of March, and we were very fortunate to leave the beginning of July, you know. So \u2014 but my husband had, as a physician, really terrible experiences. He could not treat Jewish people at all, or \u2014 or in \u2014 not \u2014 he couldn\u2019t, not Jewish, Gentile people, but Jewish people he could treat. And he would get phone calls from the family that the husband was taken to concentration camp, Dachau, Buchenwald. On \u2014 on the following week she received a \u2014 at \u2014 not a fa \u2014 didn\u2019t have faxes that time, a telegram that her husband had died on pneumonia and they have \u2014 she would get the ashes back. So he knew all these and he was very, very depressed, but it was very difficult for him to get ready to leave, much more somehow than it was for me. You know, and I felt for a longest, longest time until we had the first interview that Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Lena Gitter \u00b0 July 21, 1998 you did, I felt very guilty that I, my family, we were able to escape and \u2014 here, and I was able, you know, the education that I \u2014 that I have to make a success, and so did my husband here, and here my family and \u2014 and friends lost their \u2014 their life, and \u2014 and so I \u2014I felt very, very guilty. But now, since that \u2014 it has changed my attitude since that interview and also I did not realize that I \u2014 that I am considered a Holocaust survivor. I didn\u2019t \u2014 never, never occurred to me to be in the same category. But now I feel that I have a voice, I can do something and I\u2019m very fortunate that I have that Montessori education, or early childhood education that I was doing so much in the United States, was very successful. I got the gold medal for my work in America for the \u2014 in Montessori. I got [indecipherable] what do you call it, gold medal from the \u2014 from the embas \u2014 from Austria. I got my citizenship back, and I have a voice. Being angry, it \u2014 1t does not help. So I feel now that since the \u2014 all my writing, I have written about 18 \u2014 not \u2014 not high class and not people who made the best seller list, but they helped the people, the poor people that I worked in Mississippi to write and be able to vo \u2014 to vote."

I \u2014 I would like you to tell me how you began your professional career, and I\u2019d like you to explain about your background with Montessori. I-I would like you to take your time and do that very slowly, from the beginning, please. Interview with Lena Gitter \" July 21, 1998",
            "answer": "Well, w-w \u2014 in Vienna, you know, after the first World War, we began to ask ourselves, what is wrong with education, what has to be done? And we were young people and so we wanted to change the world. So Montessori was brought, she was a physician from Italy and she brought the Montessori method to Vienna. So we all ran to these lectures and got a \u2014 a book that sh \u2014 the first book she wrote and so on. And you had, in Vienna you had to do first your exam as a kindergarten teacher, you know, and then you could specialize in [indecipherable] in Montessori. So I took the \u2014 the training, then when I got married, I opened up a kindergarten, and I \u2014 cause I had the middle or the upper middle class children. I did not have the poor \u2014 the poor ones as I really had here in America. So na \u2014 when I first came, it took a long time til I learned enough English to take some of the tests that were necessary to establish myself. And at that time was the English word against the English [indecipherable] that\u2019s what the \u2014 some of \u2014 of the newcomers have to learn, you know, that you have to know the language in order to be political active or \u2014 or \u2014 or \u2014 or have a job and [indecipherable] thing. So first I got different jobs in special education, because at that time in the early sh \u2014 the special education was on the lower bottom of the education. So \u2014 so when I applied they were happy to \u2014 to get me to take care of the special class children. And then they were very surprised the big success, because I was bootlegging Montessori. I made a lot of material, I use that method of Montessori, and so the supervisor, she used Interview with Lena Gitter \" July 21, 1998 to bring teachers or students to observe in my \u2014 in my classes and so on, to see what I\u2019m doing."

            "question": "If you could just give a little bit of an idea for someone who does not know about Montessori.",
            "answer": "Okay. For one thing, it\u2019s a different layout of a classroom. Children are \u2014 are not expected because they\u2019re six years old that they be reading, or three years old. We don\u2019t \u2014 we \u2014 in aclassroom we have children from three to six, for instance, because a three year old one might be able to read, or a four year old one, but unable to kick a ball or something than a six year one. So they\u2019re \u2014 it\u2019s a such \u2014 like in a family. We do a different classroom arrangement. So we don\u2019t have this is the class two years old, or four year one, we have them \u2014 we have now infants\u2019 classes too, you know. So this is one of the things. And also that th-there are certain rules and \u2014 and regulations in a Montessori classroom and people in th \u2014 it has to work like a \u2014 like a society. You can \u2014 I mean, you have to show them, for instance, how Interview with Lena Gitter \" July 21, 1998 to open a door and close a door. How to lift a chair and put it down. And how \u2014 and if you play with something, that y \u2014 I cannot come and say, this I want to play now with it. So, he learns that he has to ask. We have little rugs for the children, and they put their toys on that rug, and this is his territory. So they have to learn territorial rights. It\u2019s laid out the way, like a library with the books and stuff. You just can\u2019t take out a book and then, oh, I want to read the book. We have to return it to there, and th-th-then next child can. So that the \u2014 he learns in \u2014 the way a classroom and the way the whole thing is handled, he learns the rules for society. So, th-this is a very im \u2014 important, and the different expectations for the parents too, to \u2014 to understand that, you know\u201d? And the teacher is not called a teacher, she is a directress, she directs activities. She doesn\u2019t sit at her desk and the children come in, she has to be like a hostess, stand at the door, greet the children. And as she greets them, says Esther, you have a lovely dress and your hair is done so nice. Oh, and you have such a doll. And Esther says, oh my grandma came and she brought me that doll. So you know from that, that the child will want to walk around the classroom, show the doll to her. She doesn\u2019t want to disturb. And then there comes Jim, and Jim is so sad. So he said, you know, teach \u2014 some didn\u2019t know, you know, very much. He said, you know, the police came and \u2014 and took my ha \u2014 my father to jail. Then you know that this child needs help, somebody to help him to deal with it. And so that your aid spends a lot of time because otherwise he\u2019s gonna run Interview with Lena Gitter \" July 21, 1998 around, disturbing and knocking things over [indecipherable] knocking things over. He \u2014 somehow he has to deal with it, but then you assign somebody to help him, hold his hand, take him around and so on. So that Montessori said like a hostess. If she greets the people at the door and says, oh, Mrs. Finder, you have a lovely dress today, and \u2014 and then you tell [indecipherable] or your husband to go and get yourself a drink. You don\u2019t talk to her the rest of your party, but she will come home and she says, you know, Mrs. Finder saw what a beautiful dress I had, you know. So the same way children know they \u2014 they were recognized, and that you knew dealing with their problems or \u2014 and also, this teaches sort of manners to the children, to greet people in the morning. Some people talking \u2014 were critical when I talked at one of the university, I had some black students, teachers. And he said, oh yes, you come from a country, ki-kings and queens and you shake hands and you do all these nice things. But it\u2019s a\u2014 a very important thing to be nice, and so on. And so we do a lot training and what you call practical life. And under that comes also the manners and behavior. And what is father of the cons \u2014 of the \u2014 the president, the first president, we had? George Washington. When he was 15 years old, he wrote a book on manners that is \u2014 can be had. Now, we have \u2014 \u201cThe Washington Post\u201d has a columnist and she wrote just recently a very great book on manners, the ya \u2014 and once I said, like lubrication of your wheels. At that time very Interview with Lena Gitter : July 21, 1998 few people have cars, you know. But so she had a different \u2014 so these are some of the things that were \u2014 we were teaching. It\u2019s very difficult to do it, and you know."

So I went to Mississippi to work with poor mothers and \u2014 and poor children. The \u2014 most of the southerners are Baptists, so \u2014 and so we had \u2014 the daycare centers that we opened for the War on Poverty was in Baptist churches. We could not bring kindergarten teachers in, or \u2014 because they don\u2019t want to have jobs and such. So we t-tried to train the people who lived there. I worked in Naches, Mississippi, was my first assignment, and at that time, Governor Bell did not \u2014 he was the governor of Mississippi and he did not want the \u2014 the money assigned for the president to use it. We came under a different, other th-thing. And it was very, very difficult to \u2014 to teach these mothers how they could read themselves.

So, they looked and they | \u2014 and since Montessori was the first woman who was asked to come to the \u2014 when the war was over in 1918, to the first conference in peace, and she wrote a little Interview with Lena Gitter me July 21, 1998 booklet, Peace and Education, and she was very concerned about the peace, you know. So we looked \u2014 and then I went to England for awhile to take a \u2014 a training course, and I went to different places in \u2014 in \u2014 in Europe, you know, for retraining. In the beginning we got a lot of teachers from India, because Montessori was, for 10 years she was in India, because she was Italian citizen and she would not follow \u2014 what was the name in \u2014 I forgot his name. What? Yeah, mo \u2014 and then she went to \u2014 to Spain, and then she had \u2014 she would not follow [indecipherable] the directions of, what was his name [indecipherable]. So \u2014 so we \u2014 so finally she went to India, because when the war broke out the \u2014 as an Italian citizen she had \u2014 she was for 10 years in India, and she became a f-friend with Rabindra Tagore, the first who got the N-Nobel prize [indecipherable] Indian, he wrote books and poetry and he was very much involved in peace. And also the Indira Gandhi, with Gandhi. He didn't \u2014 the two of them were not \u2014 Gandhi and Montessori were historically living the same time, but also they shared the whole idea. He was for non-violence for adults and she non-violence for children. At that time, as we see and hear it now in the newspapers and radio, the children were just suffering. Perhaps not as much, but they were \u2014 they \u2014 and when they were eight years old they went to mines to work and so on. So, you see, she was very, very involved in \u2014 in \u2014 in peace movement. And so, this is very important for us in \u2014 and to do this, and that\u2019s why I am so happy that my materials and all that is going to Vienna, yet, Interview with Lena Gitter \" July 21, 1998 w-we \u2014 we paid a [indecipherable] we\u2019ll be able to do something towards peace, and also that the university, they realize here is a Holocaust survivor and what he did with that method, you know, they will know something, cause a lot of materials and stuff, I\u2019m working with these Holocaust interns at the museum, they\u2019re from Austria. It\u2019s the fourth one or fifth one that I am working, we worked on different things, with the Montessori method and others, how it can be. So that I feel now that, of the end of my life, I feel, as Montessori said, in the service of the child, that that will go on. And, but it also \u2014 it will be a separate room where all the materials and books are being \u2014 and films and [indecipherable] si \u2014 si \u2014 many books, because textbooks are so much written for the upper middle class. Or they are tested on the university, on the professor\u2019s children. But there aren\u2019t books and materials for the children who don\u2019t have that background and don\u2019t go to the museums and all that business."

And I went \u2014 and she went to Paris, it\u2019s funny, I went to Paris, too, to \u2014 at the same \u2014 later on. And \u2014 and I got th-the materials on th-these doctors wrote.

            "question": "How did this project of, you know, with your collection being sent to Austria, how did this develop? Where did it begin?",
            "answer": "Two year ago, a\u2014a professor and \u2014 and journalist and so on from Graz, you know, in Austria, came, she \u2014 to the United States at the Library of Congress. And she had heard me speak, and when \u2014 when the biography was published and I was there to promote it. She heard me speak, but she could not come up to \u2014 there were so many people in line, she had to leave. So when she came for research she called me, and she would like to see me. So I invited her for lunch, and we became friend, and she was the one who sort of said, lis \u2014 it would be a good idea 1f you would get to know a-and get your material to know in v \u2014 in Vienna. So she sort of started, and I was thinking about it, but I really did not realize it\u2019s gonna be such a big project. So, let\u2019s see. Last year, the \u2014 the Austrian embassy gave me the \u2014 the gold medal for the work that I did because I worked a lot with these Holocaust interns, took them to some of the Jewish places, I had them for Jewish holidays because they have to learn to know how we\u2019re celebrating them. And also, I \u2014 on all \u2014 on all Interview with Lena Gitter ot July 21, 1998 the holidays, I \u2014 I invite them here to a little meal, my family and friends, and then I invite one or two with \u2014 of the Holocaust, or non-Jewish people to come. And I don\u2019t want the people to bring me flowers or candy. Everybody has to write something about that holiday. So, even these Holocaust survivors have written very interesting things, and I\u2019ve taken them to the Temple Sinai to some \u2014 so the-they learning a lot of \u2014 of Jewish life, to \u2014 and to understand. And [indecipherable] in my family I have a lot, and two of my granddaughters are married to non-Jews too, you know. So I\u2019m very interested of this understanding, you know. So, I don\u2019t know, cause a lot of people come, when they come to the Holocaust Museum, they come to visit me too, and I \u2014 I lived in different things [indecipherable]. But anyway, I don\u2019t know exactly, but all of a sudden th \u2014 told the \u2014 one of the attaches that I think maybe I have so many books, perhaps they would be interested in Vienna to get it. So he asked me, and he made sort of a temporary list and send it to Vienna. And they were very happy, and so they have already 14 boxes, and that\u2019s just with books and then films, and videos and I have hundreds of beautiful photography of the poor people in Mississippi and in New England, and different places, and it \u2014 it opens the world to the people here and in Vienna too, because they \u2014 they only think America is you know, the \u2014 the rich country, you know, it \u2014 on the Fifth Avenue, or Madison Avenue, whatever they see. So that \u2014 I\u2019m taking that movie attitude away from other people. So we started, and I looked for Interview with Lena Gitter \u201c July 21, 1998 somebody to help with the packing, and I got this young librarian at Catholic University who is very interested, and when he\u2019s off he comes and works a few hours and packs a thing. And then the embassy ships it."

            "answer": "Well, I \u2014 a lot of people in Montessori knew me and some people got involved in \u2014 in these different issues and \u2014 in America. And I got a phone call one day, would I come to Mississippi and introduce a little bit of Montessori? So I went down, and at that time in Mississippi there were different [indecipherable] Montessori, some people were from other universities with specialties in \u2014 in \u2014 in their field. So, what \u2014 we were hired by the, I th-think one of the Kennedy\u2019s brother-in-law, I don\u2019t know, he was in charge. Anyway, we were paid. So we got to Mississippi, and my husband, and we felt this is an opportunity to repay something to America. And when I got to Naches, Mississippi, I \u2014 I \u2014 one of the in \u2014 newspapers came down for an interview, one of the Catholic paper. And \u2014 a-and in there I didn't even remember, but in there I had said I felt when in Mississippi that I\u2019m back in \u2014 under Hitler, you know, the way things were going. And then to come to my hats. I wore hats because I can\u2019t always comb my hair so well. So I wore hats, and I have different hats. And the Ku Klux Klan was very much behind Interview with Lena Gitter oS July 21, 1998 me, they didn't want us to come in to teach the blacks. But I heard from somebody who was friends with the Ku Klux Klan too, said we can\u2019t take \u2014 we don\u2019t \u2014 Hitler didn\u2019t want that little Jewish woman, we can\u2019t do it either, because everybody knows her by her hats. So that was a \u2014 that sort of saved me from being killed by the klan."

            "answer": "Right. So people, some people when they go on a trip, my grandchildren or something, they bring me \u2014 I have chapeaux from all over the world. And there is a \u2014a place here in the United States, they have only \u2014 a\u2014 a woman has a shop only with hats. I shouldn\u2019t nor \u2014 need to go there, and see what I don\u2019t have. S-So \u2014 but I didn\u2019t stay the whole time, you see, in Mississippi, I did work and to train them, and I would fly back to Washington, then go down again for a week. And so it wasn\u2019t that I continuously stayed there. But you see, my teaching and \u2014 and the politic was \u2014 was one thing. Because like I worked in Naches with the poor people who didn't know how to read, an-and \u2014 and Charles Evers, he was \u2014 he was from Naches too, and he was running for an office. So he \u2014 sometimes I was up here with him, you know, on \u2014 when he \u2014 when he was \u2014 spoke somewhere, or we have catfish, or [indecipherable] and stuff. So that \u2014 you know, so I \u2014 I appeared and I was some help, you know, the [indecipherable] thing, and he was elected not because just of me [indecipherable]. But I was then at the \u2014 what\u2019s the city, the Interview with Lena Gitter a July 21, 1998 capital city, when he was elected. But we did not \u2014 our checks came from a different group, not from \u2014 from the state of Mississippi, you know. So many, many things I somehow adopted that Montessori method and I have to rewrite a lot to understand their backgrounds and their needs and so on. And it was very difficult in the beginning because these mothers wouldn't sleep or clean up. They said, oh don\u2019t I know that they don\u2019t have to do these slave type work? And I said, you know, but still, you know, we have to clean up. And then I called the \u2014 here the national gallery of art and ask the cur \u2014 one of the curators in education, could he send me some paintings that glorify work? And he did. And so we hung it in the different classrooms, and so they \u2014 the \u201cGirl with a Broom\u201d by Rembrandt, they realized now the \u2014 somehow, without having ever been to a museum, they knew that paintings are something very precious. And \u2014 and [indecipherable] and different paintings and we had it in the classrooms. And 1-it \u2014 during that time, War on Poverty, they were, you know, the se-senators and congressmen and people would come to Mississippi and they would come to visit these centers. And \u2014 and we \u2014 I taught them the names of these paintings and \u2014 on the \u2014 and so when these pa \u2014 people came, and these pro-professors and so, and painting, and \u2014 and she could say, oh this is, the name of the painting, say something. All of a sudden that little black woman without any art education was at the same level as the senator or the Interview with Lena Gitter _ July 21, 1998 [indecipherable] and she knew. So the arts plays a stellar role too, in the many things that I have done in the art."

For instance, in Vienna when I was going in stores that belonged to some of Jewish people, I didn't have look. I had braids, and \u2014 and a \u2014 they would say, fraulein, you can\u2019t go into that, the Nazis would tell me you can\u2019t go into the store, because they thought I \u2014 y- you know, that\u2019s only for Jewish people, you know. And we could not be out at \u2014 very late in the evening, and you couldn\u2019t go into \u2014 to a movie, or you couldn\u2019t \u2014 and it was the same thing, because the blacks, you could go only on the \u2014 some of the gallery [indecipherable]. And they couldn\u2019t sit in a \u2014 a restaurant. I mean, the things that were done to us in \u2014 in \u2014 under Hitler, these conditions existed there. So Interview with Lena Gitter \u201c\u00b0 July 21, 1998 I was able, you know, and then I worked with \u2014 with others, not only Mississippi, with other states, flying in, and I wrote papers and I wrote little pamphlets and different things to help the people to \u2014 to learn.

And that was a very wonderful experience, to go to the different places and talk to the teachers of their importance in educating the children that they will be able to \u2014 to go to [indecipherable] and so on. So, we stopped at different, you know, wherever there was some \u2014 some monument, we si \u2014 had to stop there, the newspaper come, and we had \u2014 I still have that shirts with their whole \u2014 with Carter and so on. So, when he \u2014 when he was elected we were invited specially to the White House and stuff.

            "answer": "A f\u2014a few friends and I have organized a little German club, and so we meeting once \u2014 once a month. And one day a Mrs. Schroeder came, and she is a journalist and so is her husband. And she came to the German club and said, I know I don\u2019t Interview with Lena Gitter * July 21, 1998 need to learn German, however I want to know what makes you guys get together and speak German, you know. And somehow, after a year or so she was there \u2014 she asks her husband, and she asked me did I want to do a book, because from what I was saying at the club, or somehow she thought that I have \u2014 we \u2014 I had a story to tell. So we did. So it was a \u2014 quite a decision, and also you know, I did not \u2014 I hadn\u2019t planned, you know, and \u2014 and a lot of dates and stuff like you are asking me. I\u2019m a\u2014 mathematics wasn\u2019t my strong forte. So, 1t was v-very difficult, but as a journalist, I mean like he went to \u2014 they went to Vienna when they were doing the \u2014 and they found the coffee shop where I went to, and they found the schools I went to, and they brought photographs and \u2014 and they got 1-1in \u2014 Austria pu-published every year, every month what\u2019s happening and every day. So he found the 1905, what in July, had happened, you know. And there were similar things being \u2014 we will want now [indecipherable] that. And some from newspaper they were \u2014 I have an awful lot of newspaper clippings, cause wherever I was, somehow there was an interview on \u2014 in some newspapers, so \u2014 we could establish some days where I went or what I did, you know, from the newspaper clippings. But this \u2014 my memory 1s not so \u2014 so good any more. In particular for dates. But, as I say, what \u2014 they were able, you know, to search through newspapers, and si \u2014 and there are some books and there\u2019s a chapter or something about me said in \u2014 in there, on the War on Poverty people who wrote books, so in several books was something about me or Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Lena Gitter * July 21, 1998 my work, you know, so \u2014 so that\u2019s how it came. It took a long time, and \u2014 but unfortunately it isn\u2019t translated into English yet. That bothers my grandchildren because they never learned any German because my daughter was so \u2014 she would not want to have her children on Hitler\u2019s language. So \u2014 so the \u2014 course there\u2019s not enough on Montessori in there, and \u2014 well, you can\u2019t di \u2014 you know, write so much when you live a long life as I did, and \u2014 but I was so fortunate as a title, it \u2014 the book, I was very lucky that what I did, 1t was a success, you know. And had some \u2014 everybody lives a life and has some sad things, but c\u2019est la vie, and it doesn\u2019t have to \u2014 just to sit and \u2014 and feel sorry for oneself, that I lost my daughter and I had to take care of my grandchildren. But I\u2019m very lucky, they all did not go on drugs, they finished their education, they are married, they have children and they are working and I can be very happy with that. And that my work that I did is successful \u2014 was very successful in that it\u2019s a \u2014 a [indecipherable] and we\u2019ll find a place and I feel in a way it will constantly remind people when they go there to visit, that this Jewish woman was a Holocaust \u2014 what the Holocaust room, even if they will not have everybody\u2019s name, but somehow I feel with the videos and with th-the \u2014 everything is going to be there, that it will be some \u2014 1n paying something back that I did not suffer. But I feel it \u2014 that the work that I have done that is being \u2014 being used, it will tell the story of these people that I did not know and that had to suffer and \u2014 and die such a terrible death. So I feel that really I have to be grateful Interview with Lena Gitter * July 21, 1998 particular to Spielberg that his first video that made me feel I have some spot in that history and I have done something with my life, and that I have in some way, is \u2014 1s \u2014 I wanted to dedicate this memorial to these people that \u2014 that I don\u2019t know, and some names I know. But I always wanted when they were talking about a stone wall with the names, the people in Vienna have such magnificent buildings and museums. People on \u2014 spent a lot of money will not go to that that. But the \u2014 the young teachers who will come to that, or people to do research will somehow remember, because I have a lot of materials from the Holocaust Museum, they were used, from the educational department.

So each of us, we Interview with Lena Gitter * July 21, 1998 have to teach much more responsibility, that I can die because you forgot to put this and that into the food, or \u2014 or you put something in \u2014 on \u2014 in my car, that, you know, would \u2014 would not drive right, and it\u2019s \u2014 so this new technology has brought a lot of responsibility too, that has to be taught in a way to the children too, you know."

            "answer": "Well, I would like to see all that material and stuff to \u2014 to go to Vienna and get in place. When you get my age you just want to be like Gandhi, he only wanted his [indecipherable] and \u2014 and his bible and his \u2014 what do you call that, the one wheel \u2014 you \u2014 spinning wheel. My grandchildren said the spinning wheel is an antique now, that would be too costly for me to \u2014 for them to buy it for me. You know, I \u2014 everything becomes very difficult. I had a professor in Vienna in psychology, and he said, once a man, twice a child. Of course at that time he didn't know about women\u2019s liberation. And I feel that we\u2019re really like children, you know, if PIl forget where I put it and \u2014 and you know, and that brings me that research 1s now going on how Montessori can be used for Alzheimer patient. So there\u2019s some of the things that we are teaching the young children would be very helpful to \u2014 as a matter of fact, I\u2019m meeting in a couple days, somebody is coming with student rep \u2014 Interview with Lena Gitter \u201c July 21, 1998 research and so I \u2014I don\u2019t know, I always get involved into something, that\u2019s easy. I don\u2019t have to plan it, I have the time."

But all the volunteers in my family, they are hooked on that. The \u2014 the days they \u2014 they go there and they \u2014 they don\u2019t want to miss it, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a wonderful [indecipherable].
