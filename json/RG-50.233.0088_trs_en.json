            "answer": "Well that\u2122s an interesting story -- because he served in the First World War and had been decorated for distinguished service the army kind of was able to pr otect their own as it were and Hitler couldn\u2122t do very much. So he was allowed to practice for a very, very long time and he was of the opinion that Hitler was blowing over and that then things would be better. So we stayed in Germany until 1939 which isn\u2122t to say th at we didn\u2122t want to leave earlier. After Kristallnacht I don\u2122t think any Jews had any doubt of what was going to be the mood of the country. I wouldn\u2122t say the fate of all Jews b ecause it wasn\u2122t known at that time. So during Kristallnacht, for example, I was in Essen alone w ith my grandfather, my father\u2122s father, while they were getting ready in Berlin, they bought all this furniture that you see here, they bought all of that and they got ready to emigrate. And I would always be left with different people, my grandfather in Essen or my grandparents in Heidelberg while they would leave."

            "answer": "One of the stories that is told, that my father to ld me is that when I was a toddler we were in the trolley car and there were a lot of men with their swastikas and we were si tting there. My father was trying to keep a very low profile and me be ing this curious little kid I started asking all about those signs that I was seeing. In a loud voice Papa [vas iss dos] and my father tried to explain very quietly so that I wouldn\u2122t cau se a commotion and nobody would notice us. And I said [very indistinct] and I just kept on and on and he wasn\u2122t able to let me know enough that I had to keep quiet. So finally he took me and we got out of the trolley car because he was afraid that we would get in trouble. My father was also in a concentration camp, in Dachau. In the early days the Nazis were imprisoning a lot of pe ople and it seems to me from what he told me he was put in because he was vice-president of th e B\u2122nai Brith chapter. So they were ransoming until they got all the money he was there. So he was there maybe two days or something like that. But he was in a concentration camp."

At that\u2122s when he started to get ready and to find out how to get out, where we could go, who would give us the affidavit, and these must have been extremely stressful times. As far as my life before that I came from very comfortable milieu. My parent s\u2122 families on both sides had lived in Germany since about the 1700s. We were very comfortable and my life was a very good one. An interesting story is told that people like my -- once my mother told the story that if my father --- this couldn\u2122t happen in the Holocaust though---he wa s so prominent, two things, first he walked into a store like Woolworth, or some kind of a low class store, people were overheard to say well -- Dr. Mendel\u2013[in German] if he goes in we could also go. But more directly, when my parents were getting ready for the emigration it was around the time of Kristallnacht and they were in Berlin and I was alone in Essen with my grandfather. When they called they were told don\u2122t come back, stay where you are. You won\u2122t be recognized in Berlin, in Essen you\u2122re too well known."

And they said to my father and my mother, my father was always the spokesman for the family, why don\u2122t you leave Ellen with us in Amsterdam? And you\u2122ll be free to settle and get yourself together because after all it\u2122s not easy with a little girl and you don\u2122t know what awaits you? And then we\u2122ll bring Ellen with us. No my father said no, no. No matter how bad things are there always will be enough for Ellen. Wherever we go Ellen will go w ith us. There will always be enough. And so we finally got out January 1940. May 10th was the invasion and all borders were closed. So the fact that I\u2122m here talking to you is a double miracl e, maybe a triple one. One is that my father didn\u2122t say yeah that might be a good idea, let\u2122s do that and then I would have been killed with my grandparents probably in Sobibor or elsewh ere because I would have been too young to useful. The second is that our number came up befo re the invasion. It was just luck. We could have been sitting there and it could have been July and we might still not have our number.
