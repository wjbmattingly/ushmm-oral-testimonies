I\u2019m at the home of Ellen Mendel and I\u2019m here on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum to interview her about her recollections of the Holocaust and about the effects of the Holocaust on her family. Before beginning I should probably mention that Ellen had some surgery this morning as a result of an accident on her foot but as a great trouper and academician she has decided to go ahead with this interview even though it is a beautiful day here in New York City.

There was Shvesta Gatzog or Shvesta Maria. So I think I got Shvesta Maria. She was over fifty so that was okay. She was nice too but from my earliest years were kind of changing caretakers. There was, of course, my mother but I think she felt it would be good to have a nursemaid for me in those early years."

They also could have somebody Jewish so maybe one of them was Jewish. If you had someone who was Jewish they could be that age. But I am aware that there was a lot of change in the beginning because even though the Nuremberg laws came out -- until they came to the people -- you know, a little time must have gone by, there was a lot of confusion. And then my mother used to say that new edicts would appear like a bolt of lightning out of the air overnight. You never knew what was going to happen next, where the Jews couldn\u2019t go, what they had to do or what they couldn\u2019t do. So my parents, for example, were married at home because that was easier."

So he was allowed to practice for a very, very long time and he was of the opinion that Hitler was blowing over and that then things would be better. So we stayed in Germany until 1939 which isn\u2019t to say that we didn\u2019t want to leave earlier. After Kristallnacht I don\u2019t think any Jews had any doubt of what was going to be the mood of the country. I wouldn\u2019t say the fate of all Jews because it wasn\u2019t known at that time. So during Kristallnacht, for example, I was in Essen alone with my grandfather, my father\u2019s father, while they were getting ready in Berlin, they bought all this furniture that you see here, they bought all of that and they got ready to emigrate. And I would always be left with different people, my grandfather in Essen or my grandparents in Heidelberg while they would leave."

            "question": "Your grandparents in Heidelberg on your mother\u2019s side of the family?",
            "answer": "One of the stories that is told, that my father told me is that when I was a toddler we were in the trolley car and there were a lot of men with their swastikas and we were sitting there. My father was trying to keep a very low profile and me being this curious little kid I started asking all about those signs that I was seeing. In a loud voice Papa [vas iss dos] and my father tried to explain very quietly so that I wouldn\u2019t cause a commotion and nobody would notice us. And I said [very indistinct] and I just kept on and on and he wasn\u2019t able to let me know enough that I had to keep quiet. So finally he took me and we got out of the trolley car because he was afraid that we would get in trouble. My father was also in a concentration camp, in Dachau. In the early days the Nazis were imprisoning a lot of people and it seems to me from what he told me he was put in because he was vice-president of the B\u2019nai Brith chapter. So they were ransoming until they got all the money he was there. So he was there maybe two days or something like that. But he was in a concentration camp."

At that point he said if I can\u2019t make my livelihood then I can\u2019t live here. At that\u2019s when he started to get ready and to find out how to get out, where we could go, who would give us the affidavit, and these must have been extremely stressful times. As far as my life before that I came from very comfortable milieu. My parents\u2019 families on both sides had lived in Germany since about the 1700s. We were very comfortable and my life was a very good one. An interesting story is told that people like my -- once my mother told the story that if my father --- this couldn\u2019t happen in the Holocaust though---he was so prominent, two things, first he walked into a store like Woolworth, or some kind of a low class store, people were overheard to say well -- Dr. Mendel...[in German] if he goes in we could also go. But more directly, when my parents were getting ready for the emigration it was around the time of Kristallnacht and they were in Berlin and I was alone in Essen with my grandfather. When they called they were told don\u2019t come back, stay where you are. You won\u2019t be recognized in Berlin, in Essen you\u2019re too well known."

And they said to my father and my mother, my father was always the spokesman for the family, why don\u2019t you leave Ellen with us in Amsterdam? And you\u2019ll be free to settle and get yourself together because after all it\u2019s not easy with a little girl and you don\u2019t know what awaits you? And then we\u2019ll bring Ellen with us. No my father said no, no. No matter how bad things are there always will be enough for Ellen. Wherever we go Ellen will go with us. There will always be enough. And so we finally got out January 1940. May 10\" was the invasion and all borders were closed. So the fact that I\u2019m here talking to you is a double miracle, maybe a triple one. One is that my father didn\u2019t say yeah that might be a good idea, let\u2019s do that and then I would have been killed with my grandparents probably in Sobibor or elsewhere because I would have been too young to useful. The second is that our number came up before the invasion. It was just luck. We could have been sitting there and it could have been July and we might still not have our number.
