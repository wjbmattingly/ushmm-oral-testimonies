But, when I was deposited in that orphanage, it was already after liberation -- very shortly after liberation. And my parents made it clear to me that I will be there only a very short time and I can only assume that the nuns were instructed that I\u2019m there only temporarily, for a couple days or weeks. So they have not tried to impose any of their influence upon me. It was like -- like, if you will, to -- to -- to be deposited in a day care center, if you wish. There was one fellow I befriended there, during those few days. He used to -- he spend there a whole war. He was Jewish, but he was not circumcised, so there was apparently no way t -- of proving that he was Jewish. But that -- that didn\u2019t have any lasting influence upon me."

            "question": "-- talk about that period as the war ended and what was going on in your life.",
            "answer": "Okay. After some very short time in the orphanage, one of my relatives -- and I don\u2019t remember exactly whether it was my sister or my parents, came to pick me up and we came back to Ungarrishbrote or Uerskibrote, the town from which we fled in 1942, to Slovakia. If I remember correctly, in those -- in that period that I was in the orphanage, my parents succeeded having our house returned to us. Because, during the war, our house was occupied by Christians, who were not very pleased, apparently, to vacate the house after the war. Because majority Christians who found themselves into those situations, assumed that the Jews have perished. That they will be able to stay there forever. So, we returned to our own house. I remember, after few days or weeks, I joined the Boy Scouts. I had got -- got a nasty infection on my foot and had to be operated on and had to be transported for the operation to Ungarishradish or Werskaradishka, which had a hospital. And the only doctor in Ungarishbrote who was available, said that because the war has ended such a short while earlier, they didn\u2019t had any ether -- anesthesia, to put me to sleep. So I had to go to Ungarishradish for operation. I stayed there a couple of days. My father, in the meantime, traveled throughout the Czechoslovakia. Mainly -- his dental office was confiscated by the Nazis. And the provisional Czech government wanted to return it to him, but of course, the original equipment, God knows where it disappeared. So, the government has said that they will give him a dental equipment left by fleeing Germans. So he can choose any dental office that he wants to, with one condition, that the office will stay in that city in which it is. And the Czech government promised to find for us an apartment in that city. So, from what I understand, my father looked over about five or six dental offices and has selected one in the city of Zenime or Zenoimal, which is about one hour by train away from Vienna, in southern Moravia. And in, I think September of \u201845, we have moved. Correction, it must have been later. October or November, we have moved to Zenoimal. And while in Uerskibrote, I started getting private tutoring lessons, because I was still at a compulsory school age. And the debate was with the school board, whether I should be admitted to a class according to my chronological age or placed in a class according to my academic knowledge. And until that issue was resolved -- because the local school board didn\u2019t had any instructions how to proceed. So, in the meantime, I was having a private tutor, so I think that during the summer of \u201845, I was spending it with a tutor. And in September, I started school. In the meantime, the ruling was that I had to attend classes according to my chronological age. So, of course, I was -- I was totally unprepared, after four years -- five years being out of school. So I -- I always had very poor grades as a result. And then my father selected the dental office in Zenoimal, so we have moved to Zenoimal. I remember the travel throughout the Czech Republic by train was an ordeal, because th-the cars were not only filthy and dirty, but all the windows were broken. And it was -- the trains were running, God knows how. So Zenoimal -- the city of Zenoimal, I think at that time, it -- it must have had a population of about 20,000, was heavily scarred from Germans fleeing to Austria. There were several burn out tanks left over in the city. A great part of the city was in ruins. And almost all the windows in Zenoimal were broken, because allies were bombing Vienna. And Vienna Noiseshtatel, which had apparently German ammunition factories, and from the vibration of the bombs, the glass of the windows simply broke. So, then I stayed in Zenoimal, I think til about 1947. Yes, in May of 1947, I finished my compulsory educational requirements, which at that time, were nine grades. I did not qualify for high school, simply because of academic deficiencies. And the fact that I was Jewish and suffered from a lack of education was not taken into account. And in 1947, the problem was asked, okay, what do I do now? The city of 20,000 people did not have many opportunities for young people. There were a couple openings in various trades. In the Czech economy at that time, usually somebody who selected a trade went into apprenticeship status for next three years. So, there were openings if you wanted to become a barber or a painter or a sales clerk. All those trades are -- required three years apprenticeship. But somehow it came to my attention that a textile factory was looking for apprenticeship connected with bort and learning classes. So, the whole picture came -- began to look like a two year long apprenticeship, with half a day of practical work in a textile factory and half a day of classroom work. I succeeded, with my father\u2019s help, to enter the program and left home to a small village in which there was a textile factory. I-It used to be owned by Jews. And I started as an apprentice in -- in that factory and I believe that the program was the first year. We were to rotate in the textile factory, from department to department and the second year you should have selected a department, which would become your specialty. So I finished the first year, but even during the first year, I still had physical problems, because I was extremely weak as a result of the war. Furthermore, I never felt quite home, because I was the only Jewish apprentice in our class of about 60. So I was sort of a curiosity. And I finished, I think, first half of the second year, when my parents suggested that -- by that time, it was 1948. The Communists already took over the government of Czechoslovakia when my parents came to me with the question whether I would be willing to emigrate to Israel. Do you have any --"

Did -- Did you feel, because you were behind in your schooling, did -- did that make you feel -- a-and your experience was different from others in the village, I -- I assume, so wh -- did you feel alienated or -- or set apart from -- from your -- your classmates?",
            "answer": "I -- I do not think that I felt alienated from my classmates, maybe because all of them were on the nine year track, rather than on the 12 year track. And simply, they were too young to have had first hand experience with the Nazis or Jews, because they grew up under normal conditions, with the exception of -- of -- of the war years. But in Zenoimal, a great percentage of the students 1n the nine -- in -- in -- in the lower grades, commuted from neighboring villages. And they were sons of farmers, who basically didn\u2019t feel the war in the same fashion like people who were living in the cities. Because in the -- in the outlying areas, you know, the Nazis didn\u2019t had such a tight control like over the population of -- of -- of larger cities."

While I was going to school in Zenoimal, it never occurred to me, \u201cGosh, in -- in a year or two I will be finished, what do I do then?\u201d It -- It never occurred to me. I -- during the war, because of my being locked up always in -- in rooms, I had tremendous energy, which first had to be satisfied. And, as a result, I played soccer. I was very good at soccer. Although, because of my physical -- being physically weak, I didn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t able to run for a long time. But still, I was a very good soccer player in my own group of youngsters. So, most of the time, I tried to catch up on the physical activities, which I missed during the war, rather than on the emotional side. The physical deficiencies came to me more naturally than the academic development."

You see, in those days, although penicillin was all ready -- after the war, was already invented, but it was question of availability. So that was -- that was problem number one. Then, when, during your formative years, you are continuously locked up, your body does not get the opportunity to develop physically. And consequently, I -- I was weak, physically and undernourished. So all that, first of all, I had to catch up with. I don\u2019t know what I ever caught up. Basically, I will tell you something, I think that I caught up with most of the deficiencies, but I was always out of sync."

But, you know, coming to a 13 year old boy with a task, why don\u2019t you write a book about your experiences, didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t sit with me quite, quite well. I didn\u2019t see any purpose for it, you know. Because it\u2019s -- it\u2019s completely different than looking at it in hindsight, 50 years, you know."

I mean it ma-may not have felt that way to you, but if I were a classmate and I had a friend who\u2019d -- who had done what you did during the war, I might be curious about hearing -- hearing about it.",
            "answer": "I don\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t think that the issue was ever -- ever raised. You know, okay, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m- you are right, had it happened now. But don\u2019t forget, you have to project yourself to those days. Czechoslovakia, for example, looking in hindsight, had only small number of newspapers that were all published in the capital city of Prague. I don\u2019t remember ever seeing a local newspaper. Television didn\u2019t exist. Radio -- those people who could afford a radio, Czechoslovakia had only two or three radio stations which had three or four times a day news, the news were mostly of international nature. So that news penetrated very, very slowly at -- int - to the population. Usually news that was of local importance appeared on a bulletin board. Every city had, on -- in the major streets, had big bulletin boards, where some officials used to paste announcements. But otherwise, you simply didn\u2019t know what is happening, unless you heard it over the radio, or if you knew a foreign language, to listen to Radio Vienna or -- or -- or some adjacent city, listening to the news that way. So that people didn\u2019t know exactly, what was happening -- what happened in the past. And I do not think that people were all that curious to find out somebody else\u2019s experiences. Maybe -- Maybe -- Maybe people -- don\u2019t forget that Christians in -- in those days, after the war, felt guilty. Because the Judaism in -- in -- in -- in -- in Czechoslovakia, the anti-Semitism was more of a religious character. We Jews were not so much despised by the Czechs because we were wealthy or -- or -- or -- or more successful, but whenever the word Jew was thrown into my face, it was always labeled, you Christ killer. So, you know -- and that was after the war against the law."

            "answer": "That was -- that was a little bit strange. My father and my mother had frequent fights, but I never knew exactly the nature of the fights, because they were all done in my absence. You know, children, if they\u2019re left out -- whenever something very serious took place, the children were sent out of the room, or parents waited for the children, while they were in school or outside, to -- to settle their differences. So there was a tension between my parents, but the tension was also caused, to a great deal, by my sister, who was no longer living with us. She was eight years older than I and she was trying to find her own way, recognizing that the c-city of Zenoimal d-does not have many opportunities to offer her. Furthermore, she was already marriage age, so she was living in -- in Prague and later on in Burno, in Brinn, working as a secretary -- steno for some firms. So there were also tensions caused because of her. But overall, the time after the war was not -- before I left for Israel, was not entirely smooth. And only later, when I came to Israel, I realized why. But by then, I was already thousands of miles away, not being in the position to influence the situation one way or the other."

            "num": 27,
            "question": "And what was it that you realized at that point?",
            "answer": "Okay. Now, I have to go a little bit back to talk about the last days prior to departure to Israel. I do not know whether, in retrospect -- I have to mention that after leaving for Israel, I have never seen my parents again. Consequently, I cannot ask them for details of those days. But, my father arranged for me to go to -- to emigrate to Israel with a group of youngsters my age. I have met with part of that group. Neither one of -- of the group was from Zenoimal, they all were dispersed throughout Czechoslovakia, but these individuals were already together a year or two in preparation for pioneering life in Israel. So, I was attached to that group. And that group belonged to a very left oriented political party. It was almost Communism. That -- the group had aimed to emigrate to Israel and supplement membership of a kibbutz -- very left oriented kibbutz. And I felt extremely uncomfortable after arriving in Israel, in that kibbutz type surrounding. Because, I was exposed to the Communist propaganda in 1948 and I was able to realize that the Russians were extremely anti-Semitic. So, I began to realize that I fled Communism of Czechoslovakia, just to come into a different form of Communism in Israel. But it -- it -- it was not initiated in my mind by -- so much by politics, but by various actions of that group, to which I supposedly had to conform to their way of life. For example, all the personal clothes -- clothing were taken away. They were all arranged in a group type -- communal type bank. You got clothing, two sets a week, depending on your size. You didn\u2019t know whose clothing you are wearing. Meals were given in a mess hall. Every morning you have to look at your schedule where you were attached to work that day. So I became extremely bitter, fleeing from Communism in Czechoslovakia, facing myself with Israeli Communism, although it was that kibbutz. Furthermore, no money. We were -- the kibbutz was quite a few miles from any village. Everything you needed, you had to go to the group leader and ask for it. Everything was allocated to you. Toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving cream, shaving blades, shoelaces, everything was rationed. You were permitted to write one letter a month. It was -- that group gave you the postage stamp. So it was extremely regimented type of life, which -- which didn\u2019t sit with me. But I\u2019m not quite certain, my father signed some documents, which legally obligated me to that group. But I think -- yes, I exited Czechoslovakia on 10th of April, \u201849. It was a -- one of the last transports of Jews that was permitted to exit Czechoslovakia. There were about thousand of us. By train we rode from Prague to Italy. At that time was in existence, international refugee organization, was I think United Nations sponsored. And we ended up in a transition camp in Tranee, in Italy, which is not far away from that port, Barre, in Italy. And there we waited for ship to take us to Israel. We spent some two weeks in that camp because April \u201849 was Passover and the Israeli ship didn\u2019t wanted to sail during Passover holiday. So when we came to Israel -- yes, I mentioned, we left 10th of April Prague, we arrived in Israel, 26th of April, \u201849 in Haifa. From there we went to transition camp, which again went against my grain because it had a fence -- concertina fence, with guards. We were sprayed heavily, DDT and each time you wanted to exit the camp, you had to clear it with the guards at the gate. And after several days in the camp, trucks came pick us -- pick -- pick us up and we were driven to the kibbutz, where all these events took place. So, in the kibbutz, I think we worked about three days a week and two days a week we learned Hebrew and geography of Israel. That was still in \u201849 -- in April \u201849, when we arrived. It was not quite a year since establishment of state of Israel, which I think came into existence in my -- May of \u201848. But then, the war with Arab nations took place, so I came to Israel just shortly after the cease fire with the Arab nations was signed. So there was still great deal of uncertainty whether it will not flair up once again. Do you have any questions up to that point?"

            "answer": "But I would like to skip it for the time being. In -- I came to the kibbutz, I think, in about -- taking the refugee camp into -- I think in May of \u201849, we finally came to the kibbutz. And in November of *49, I quit. I simply had -- I had enough of it. I had some very distant relatives living in Haifa, so with their permission, I got room and board in their household. And from November of *49, to July of \u201850, I lived with them and worked on various odd jobs. In a factory for mirrors, in a factory for -- that was making plastic buttons for furniture. Until, in July of \u201850, I was drafted into the service. I ended up with agricultural unit which had na -- an acronym, Nuchile, nor koletseem luchem, and went to basic training in Jerusalem for three months. And after the basic training, we ended up -- again we were divided into groups and my group was put for a training of about six months in a different form of a kibbutz, called Moshaf. There we were to learn that particular trade -- that agricultural line and after the six months of training, we were to -- as a group of military personnel, we were to settle on the border with Jordan and build a village, an agricultural establishment. For that reason, we were discharged from uniform military, but had to stay for the duration of ma -- our military obligation in that village, under paramilitary rules. Leaving that village prior to expiration of the military obligation would have meant that you would have been drafted and put back into uniform. So, with various finagling, I was able to leave that village temporarily, because the village was unable to support all of us. So some -- some of us had to go and seek outside employment. And I found a job with a Israeli corporation that was laying a pipeline from Tel Aviv to the Negev desert. And part of my pay, I was sending to my village, not so much to support them economically, but to show good faith that I still am in touch with them."

        {
            "num": 31,
            "question": "And this -- the village in Israel?",
            "answer": "In Israel. And that labor camp that was laying that pipeline, was on the edge of the desert Negev, about two hours by car from Tel Aviv. And that village that I was obligated to, was on the border of Jordan and Israel, where this was deeper, in the southern part of Israel. And in the labor camp -- it was a regular labor camp with the barracks made of wood. Every morning you exit to work on the pipeline and in the evening you return. There was a mess hall. You were paid regularly -- a regular salary according to classification of your particular work. And there I stayed for about a year, I think. In the meantime -- now I began to realize what was happening back in Czechoslovakia. A radio announced the trials took place -- I don\u2019t know whether you are familiar with that, in -- in the 50\u2019s, quite few ministers of the Czech Republic were sentence to be hanged. You know, these were out of made -- made up trials, accusing them of being spies for the US And Stalin was simply out of his mind by -- by -- the Communist regime was very, very tight in Czechoslovakia. Then one day, I received letter that my mother committed suicide, and now I have to go back again. Some place and some times, during the war, when we were hiding in the mountains, in the bunker, two fellows, young fellows, came to the bunker and I don\u2019t know until this day how did they found us, suggesting that we should return, that they actually will help us across the border, back to Protecterat. Because Protecterat, by that time, was cleared of Jews. And if we will be in hiding in Protecterat, the Germans will have no reason to look for us, because all the Jews were already sent to concentration camps. So I don\u2019t know the fine points, where we were to hide on the other side, but they were guiding us from the bunker, across the border, back to Protecterat, when we were to rest in a tourist resort, which was exactly on the border. And as we approached the tourist resort, subtly we heard barking of dogs. And that usually was a bad sign. So these two guys told us to wait, that they will go and take a look why the dogs are barking and they simply never came back. So, we returned to the bunker. And now events took place as I said before, normal. We waited out the war without knowing what happened to these two guys. After the war, we were called as witnesses to court. These two boys were supposedly caught in that resort by the Germans and forced to collaborate. I don\u2019t know exactly what that meant -- these were young fellows, in -- in their early 20\u2019s -- what was actually meant by collaborations, but in the early years, after the war, there were criminal cases by the hundreds, throughout the whole Czechoslovakia, against various collaborants with the Nazis. That took place long before the Communists took over Czech Republic. And we were called witn -- to be -- be witnesses on behalf of these two fellows. And I do not remember exactly what sentence did these two boys got or whether they were liberated. Unfortunately that did not end there. In 1948, while I was in the textile school, I started having feeling that not everything is okay at home, but I was unable to put my finger on it. Namely, every month, I came for a weekend home and my mother was always in tears and my father was furri -- furious. And I didn\u2019t know whether these were -- whether they had differences as man and wife or what -- what- what was nature of their conflict. So, sometimes -- and I don\u2019t know exactly what time period, was I able to begin to put things together. I suspect that the first time I got some form of picture in 1965, when I visited Czechoslovakia back for the first time. The following thing has developed. These two boys joined a -- became member of a club, American - Czechoslovak friendship. And when Communists took over Czechoslovakia, they began to arrest all the members of this club. And the two fellows approached my mother, because we lived so near Austrian border, whether she can help them to escape to Austria. And it was a whole group of Czech patriots in Zenoimal, who were involved in helping to escape -- various people. There was custom officials involved in it. Postal officials involved in it. They smuggled people on trucks that went across the border to de-de-deliver packages. So people were hiding behind the packages. But nevertheless, the Secret Police got wind of it and arrested the whole group of people, including my mother, and put them on trial. And I still have at home, documents of the trial, the whole protocol. I do not remember when -- how long the trial took place -- for how long, but my mother was freed, simply because she claimed that she wanted to -- to repay the boys their goodness that they helped us to -- tried to help us during the war. She was freed. But the Secret Czech Police tried to convert my mother into a snitch to spy on others. My mother was imprisoned for about half a year. And in 1952 or \u201853, out of desperation, she jumped out of the window of the police station. And that -- what I got in a letter notice while I was in that labor camp in Israel, building the pipeline, I got a letter from my sister. So, as time went by, bits and piece of -- of the pieces began to -- to make sense what was happening. And even though my parents send me to Israel, they promised that they will join me in the next transport. And looking at it back now, I think there are two versions -- two possibilities. The Czech government began to realize that it is letting too many medical doctors out of Czechoslovakia and they are weakening their own economy. So they stopped issuing emigration permits to medical doctors. That is one possibility. The other possibility is that my mother was already heavily investigated by the secret police and they did not wanted to let my parents exit. Which of the two forms is correct, I do not know."

But, my first visit in Czechoslovakia was only two weeks long and I simply did not have enough time, nor I didn\u2019t know just what can I do under the Communist regime and what can I not? Because I came from US, which was their biggest enemy and every time you went to a city, you had to report with the local police station, who registered. And when you exited, you had again to let them know that you are leaving. So, I didn\u2019t know exactly what -- what was going on. But this fellow wrote up that the minister was imprisoned by the Communists and freed eventually, after several years, but in such a poor health, that not long thereafter, he died. And I have that article with -- even with his photo, of that minister. You see, there were couple Christians, during our experiences, who actually practiced Christianity.

I don\u2019t know how -- how -- they used to call it agitation center. It was sort of a cultural center, in which the Communist events took place. So we were -- if you want to play soccer next Sunday, you have to come Tuesday, wearing a white shirt and a red scarf, to that Communist cultural center and start singing various songs glorifying the labor. If you will not come, you will not play soccer game next Sunday. So that all started to go against my grain. I don\u2019t think it was with a full understanding what Communism 1s, but all that order giving process began to remind me so much of the Nazis. Didn\u2019t the Nazis did exactly the same thing to me? Telling me what stores can I visit, what streets can I go to and what am I permitted to do and what not permitted to do?

I started in New York as a shipping clerk. And I started going to night school, first in preparation for GED high school equivalency test, then after passing that, I was going to college at night, paying for it through my own pocket.

Later on, it -- it -- 1t turned that that was the only way out, but the original plan was to join my uncle in New York and my father already, in Czechoslovakia, started learning English and prepare himself for US dental examination for foreign doctors, which he knew that he will eventually have to take. So that the seeds were already planted in my mind in Czechoslovakia and I started putting them into action in about 1952, I believe. Not knowingly. I was still in the Israeli military. I walked to the emba -- American embassy in Tel Aviv and they asked me several questions and when they discovered that I\u2019m still under military obligation, they told me that they cannot even register me until I am discharged from the army. And about 1953, I came back. I was already di-discharged. They said they cannot register me once again, because US has closed emigration quota for Czechoslovakia, because Czechoslovakia supplies arms to North Korea. And, as you know, at least in those days, emigration quota to US was determined by the country of your birth, not of your si -- current -- present situ -- citizenship. And Czechoslovak quota was very small, furthermore, it was closed. Furthermore, I had no right to any preferential quota. So that I would be asked, if I still was interested, to come back once the closure is lifted. So I came back in \u201854, when finally I was able to register under a non-preferential quota and it took five years before finally I was called to submit my documents. By that time I have discovered that I don\u2019t have a birth certificate, so I have to go to the Czech embassy to apply for birth certificate. Then, I didn\u2019t know I had to submit an affidavit of support, which I had to obtain from somebody in the US. So I had to write to my relatives in Czechoslovakia and my grandfather was able to broker -- can you visualize Communist censored letters from Czechoslovakia to US, trying to broker for me a affidavit of support to come to the US? It was very, very delicate operation and through some very distant relatives whom I -- until that point, never met, sent me an affidavit of support and lend me money for passage, because my savings went all for preparation of the papers, because everything had to be translated from Czech to English and from Hebrew into English and the Israelis had to pay some taxes, because -- which I -- I\u2019m not so certain that you know of that fact, that when you emigrate to Israel, the Israeli government, at it\u2019s own expense, puts you through a language course and puts you through that refugee camp. But, for all that the Israeli government pays, from the donation of the American government, the dollars and the Jews that donate money to Israel. So, a certain fixed amount of money is granted for absorption of a single person or a family and so forth and so forth. And that is a open debt which you have. As long as you are staying in Israel, the debt is never called, but once you want to leave Israel, they send you a bill for all that. So I had to pay it back."

Apartments were in very short supply. In those days it was almost impossible to rent an apartment in Israel. You had either to buy it, like you buy a co-op here, or a condominium, or you have to put key money. I don\u2019t know whether you are ever -- you know, familiar with that concept of key money. Let\u2019s say you are renting an apartment. You have to put -- just as an example -- 10,000 dollars as a deposit to the landlord and you pay him a month, 10 dollar rent.

Our first stop was Paris. I flew with Air France. In Paris, I stayed about two or three hours and boarded another Super Constellation to New York.

Arriving in New York, it was not Kennedy Airport, but 1t was Idlewild Airport in those days. I arrived, I think about 4:30 in the morning.

He looked at my papers and say, \u201cYou just made it in time.\u201d I came three days before my entry visa was to expire. And there were waiting some very distant relatives, for me, at Idlewild Airport, who took me to their apartment in Manhattan. I slept there, I think, for about 10 hours. First time that I was able to eat a decent European type meal and have apples. You know Israel is very, very short on apples, because of the climate.

And now I have to digress little bit from this original -- from the story. You see, my family, like many Jewish, central European families, my family was very large, but dispersed. The dispersion was not caused by Hitler, but it was caused by the break up of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Consequently, people who were born in Vienna or in Budapest, finally -- suddenly found themselves being citizens of a independent, but different country. The monarchy disappeared. And as a result, there was a barrier between us, because they were living in foreign countries. Not only that, but at the time of the break up of the monarchy, I think in 1920 -- around 1920\u2019s, US established immigration quotas and there was no longer Austro-Hungarian quota, which never existed anyhow, but everybody who went to come to the US, came according to the quota of the country of which he was a citizen now, in which he was born. So some people had to wait long time, some people didn\u2019t had to wait long at all. Some family\u2019s entry to the US was actually broken up because the husband was born in a different country than the wife. And my uncle, after the first World War ended, was one of f-four brothers. Leo, who was the oldest one, emigrated to United States in 1913, one step ahead of the police. He was gamble -- he was gambling in cards and horses and apparently signed some IOU\u2019s, which he was unable to redeem. So, the Austrian police was after him, and in those days, if you were a crook in Europe, you came to United States, like Al Capone. So, he came to the US. He settled here, but severed contacts with his family, so we didn\u2019t know whether he is alive or not. And he lived in New Jersey, in a small town called Morristown, about one hour from New York City. His brother Herbert became extremely wealthy textile mer -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B ",

And, at the start, when Nazis marched into Czechoslovakia in \u201838, he found himself in Switzerland, vacationing with his whole family. So, he never went back to Czechoslovakia. He had enough money with him, still, to make him very comfortable, but no longer multi- millionaire. From Switzerland, he went to France and from France to Portugal.

But my New York uncle didn\u2019t wanted to forgive him. He said that he forgives him, but whenever discussion came to it, 1t was still there. I decided to leave New York and move to Morrisstown. My Morrisstown uncle found me a job in a department store in Morrisstown, I became a shoe salesman. And my Morrisstown uncle attached himself to a wealthy Jewish family in Morrisstown. He worked for them. They owned a hotel, a very small, rundown hotel, but nevertheless, he was living there. And he found, in that family, a second home. He attached to hi -- to himself to that family. And they treated him very nicely and he felt very warmly toward them. And they were extremely wealthy. And they looked upon me in a very favorable fashion, that finally my uncle, who from 1913, until 1960 was alone, finally found family member who likes him -- who loves him. So they liked me because of it. But, they always gave themselves as example of American success. They always pointed out to me their children. Let\u2019s say, their married daughters. They claimed that if you take a good boy, from a good family and match him -- match her up with a good girl from a good family, that it has to be success.

I have spent about 2,000 dollars towards my tuition in college, because I went to a private school. No state school in New Jersey wanted to admit me because I had a very, very low score on -- how was it called in that time -- Princeton College Boards. And state school said, \u201cNo, we have strict regulations, try private school. They don\u2019t have such strict regulations.\u201d So I was admitted, but I had to pay, in those days, oh about -- beginning tuition was about 27.50 per credit hour. And by the time I finished, it was about 55 dollars per credit hour. And multiply it by 130 credits and I paid for everything from my own pocket, except those 2,000 dollars that my uncle left me.

I wanted to become a chemical engineer. But my background in -- in math was not sufficiently strong to gain admission to engineering school. Then, engineering school was five years long, instead of four years. That would have created another problem. Then, I felt that to study something other than accounting would require a much better knowledge of the English language than I possessed .Then the school, even though it was a private university, regulated to some degree, the sequence of the courses I was taking -- I had to take. Because everybody who was admitted under GED had first to take English, History, Math and Language, before taking anything else. The 15 -- the first 18 or 24 credits, you were simply on probation. So I -- I felt like walking continuously on a thin ice. And then American girls had tremendous influence on my way of thinking. Because I heard, in Israel -- you know, Israel is a haven for Jewish American women. And I don\u2019t mean it as a joke. You would be surprised how many American Jewish women come to Israel to find a husband. And some of them are extremely wealthy and some of them are really willing to compromise and go down very low on the economical le -- ladder to find a Jewish husband. Many marriages end up in a disaster. Very few American Jewish girls stay in Israel. They usually bring their husbands to the States. And many of the Jewish boys simply don\u2019t measure up to the expectations. But, in Israel, in my days, there was generated the saying that American girls have tremendous body, but instead of a heart, they had a computer. And that was confirmed to me when I was dating American Jewish girls. I -- for first 10 years, I dated only -- tried to date only Jewish American girls and it was always the same result. \u201cYou are a nice boy, but you are nothing economically.\u201d The girls told me, \u201cWe are seeking somebody who has it made already.\u201d Again, I was out of sync. \u201cYes, you have perseverance. We see that you are going nights to school, you are trying to better yourself.\u201d But I got my BS, I was 37.

Because in \u201868, if you remember th-the Prague\u2019s sprink liberated the exit and he succeeded coming to the US for a visit, leaving his wife and children as hostages that he will come back. And we started talking and he said, \u201cLook, you will have absolutely no problems --\u201d he asked me why I\u2019m still single, so I describe him the situation and he said, \u201cLook, that doesn\u2019t surprise me. You simply don\u2019t fit, culturally with American girls. You would be much better off finding a Czech girl.\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, how that would be possible after so many years not being there? A whole generation or two were born.\u201d So he said, \u201cLeave it to me, I will look around.\u201d And he lined up about five or six girls and I came for a visit. I went out with all of them and I selected one. And in 1970, I went once or twice again to Czechoslovakia and I established correspondence with one of the girls and it clicked without any problems.

I do not know whether she started -- yeah, she was hired at Mount Sinai, but Mount Sinai had a strange employment structure. It is very heavily unionized and there are various categories. There are union for nurses, union for blue collar workers. Everybody\u2019s unionized and everybody belongs to a different union, and every union has a different pay scale. And my wife belonged to union of medical technicians, and the union of medical technicians has a -- has the lowest pay scale than the union of blue collar workers. And she, coming from a Communist country, was extremely insulted that she, with all her medical training, is getting paid less than the janitor is paid. And that was insulting to her. But, looking at it in retrospect, I think -- and I will of course never, never ask her about it, that she gave me that as an excuse, but I think that she was very, very homesick and tried to cover up for it by giving me that excuse. In 1971, about year after she came to the States, she went already for a visit to Czechoslovakia, to visit her mother. And she tells me -- she was there about a month, that she had -- have -- had to think about it very deeply whether she wants to come back to US or not. But, apparently, I don\u2019t know whether she made the decision on her own or whether her mother talked her into it, she came back."

            "answer": "I do not know. I do not know one -- when I told him. He asked me, for example, why did we named him Leon. So when I started telling him that he was named after Uncle Leon, he started asking about Uncle Leon. And I think that\u2019s how it led towards -- towards the Holocaust issue. Then, when I -- after I moved from mo -- New York to Morrisstown, I kept meeting with my New York uncle about once a month. He was extremely angry at me that I deserted him and decided to break bread with his brother, whom he never forgave. And my uncle in New York continuously kept criticizing everything I did. He used always negative criticism. H-He always told me, \u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d but he never told me what to do instead. And I raised couple times the issue, \u201cWhat would you say if I married a Christian girl?\u201d So he was very much against it. So when I did marry my wife, I simply didn\u2019t tell him that I\u2019m going to marry. I came back and on nec -- our next meeting, I told him, \u201cUncle, I just came back from Czechoslovakia and I married a Christian girl.\u201d And that was the end for him. We had a fight and we never saw each other again. That was in 1970. And in 1973, he died, natural death. He got a heart attack. But there comes a related and also interesting story. He had a daughter, a ravishing beauty. She was about 18 or 19, right out of high school, when she married her sweetheart, graduate of Columbia, engineer, who worked for Sperry Gyroscope in New York, on Long Island. An extremely well paying job, very bright, good looking fellow. They lived on Long Island and I saw her twice in 1959. And I was unable to see her again and I had the feeling that, at that time, that because I didn\u2019t lived up to my aunt\u2019s and uncle\u2019s expectations, that they ins-instigated her against me. And about year or two later, in early 60\u2019s, he quit his job with Sperry Gyroscope and moved to Palo Alto, California, got a very high position with one of the electronics firms in Palo Alto. And my uncle never wanted to give me their address. So, I lost complete contact with them and when my uncle died, in \u201873, I was trying to find out their address. But my aunt, the one who hated me, was still alive and she didn\u2019t wanted to speak to me. And I didn\u2019t know how to find them. I looked telephone books, looked every place, I was unable to find them. And about two years ago, don\u2019t ask me how and why, I exhausted all the avenues of finding her and suddenly something occurred to me. I wrote to New York City, asking for my uncle\u2019s death certificate and they answered me that I have insufficient information, that maybe he died outside of New York City and in which case they will not have his death records. And about at that time, I bought an internet and I went through the Social Security -- some organization publishes death registry by states and Social Securities on the internet and I found my uncle. And I wrote to New York City again, this time giving his Social Security number and they gave me, for 15 dollars, his death certificate. And on New York City\u2019s death certificate, on the bottom, is a line for informant of the death. There was my aunt -- aunt\u2019s name and her address, which was the same like my uncle used to be. Then, I discovered that my aunt died in 1983, so I sent for her death certificate. And the informant\u2019s name on her death certificate was her daughter. She was not living in Palo Alto, she was living in Los Altos, which is about 10 miles from Palo Alto. I wrote her a letter and three days later, she called me by telephone. And I ask her, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you looked for me? My name is in the telephone book.\u201d She had unlisted number. 39 years it took me to find her. She said she had a very miserable childhood. Her mother hated her. Her -- the day she came to her mother, telling her that, \u201cI\u2019m getting married,\u201d her mother said, \u201cYou are dead for me. You are leaving me, your own mother. I don\u2019t want to know you any more.\u201d And she told me things about her parent\u2019s marriage which make my few hair rise. That also that marriage was only in name. All those high standards that they asked me to live up to, they didn\u2019t even come close in one percent to those standards. And she is divorced. What is she, my cousin? My niece? My cousin. My uncle\u2019s daughter."

Used textbook, high school textbooks and after work, I locked myself in my room and I read many of the books that are required from high school kids to be read.

We started -- after about -- my wife started working, I think, in January of \u201870 and -- no, that would be incorrect. \u201870 she came only to the States. In \u201871- in January of \u201871, she started working and in one year we saved enough money for a down payment on a house, which we bought in community called Hopatcong, Lake Hopatcong. It\u2019s not far away from Morrisstown and we both commuted daily to New York City. It was 55 miles each way. And for a time, we realized that we cannot afford anything living closer to New York City, because of the expense. But, at that time, I don\u2019t think that my wife si -- she simply was not long enough in the US to be able to advise me or make up her mind just which way to go. I think she was more dependent on my decisions. But I began to realize a very interesting thing in Mount Sinai. It probably was not affiliated with Affirmative Action, but Mount Sinai Hospital was very proud at it\u2019s employment record, advertising -- at least among the employees, that they employ people from every nation under the sun, except Mexico. But something very interesting was taking place. Not only were you almost -- mor -- it was almost impossible to cross the boundaries of the various unions. But, in order to maintain some sort of a equilibrium, even though it seems to me maybe I was imagining it, whenever they occurred a vacancy in the non -- in the administrative positions, they -- Mount Sinai replaced the vacancy -- filled the vacancy with exactly the same nationality it was created by. So, when an Italian American left an position, exactly Italian American took that same position. So, I was asking, \u201cHow do I fit as a Czech Jew?\u201d I was the only one. I have absolutely no chance. So I was looking at some opportunity for bettering myself. And prior to Mount Sinai, I worked again for about half a year, Allied Chemicals, this time as a professional, but they had implemented an austerity program and they laid me off. And prior to ma -- to Allied Chemicals, I worked for public accounting firm. At that time I had a dream that I will become a CPA. And in New Jersey at that time, you either had to work 10 years for the US government, or three years for a CPA firm, in order to qualify for CPA examinations. And I forgot -- I decided that CPA firm is not for me. That CPA\u2019s are in demand also in industry. But how do I gain the CPA examination qualifications? Simply by joining US government. So that led me to decision to join the US government. And originally I applied for a slot with the IRS, but from OPN in New York -- Office of Personnel Management, my rating was too high for the IRS starting position. And apparently, the Department of Defense had many more vacancies in that grate. So I was picked up by the US Army. And instead of commuting 55 miles to New York, I was commuting now seven miles to Picatinni Arsenal. My wife was still working at Mount Sinai. She hitched always, a ride with a coworker. And Picatinni Arsenal had a layoff and I, through the layoff process -- they call it dariff -- I found another position at Potuxin Naval Air Station, here in Maryland. So, we moved to Maryland. My wife got a job as a technician, medical technician in LaPlata Memorial Hospital. And from Potuxin Naval Air Station, I got a promotion to David Taylor Model Basin. Do you know where it is?"

And I started going to Catholic university. And, in 1988, again I had here a problem with a colonel, who was director.

I worked for a month as a shoe salesman for Bloomingdale\u2019s. The shoe salesman experience from Morrisstown came very handy. Then I got a position which could have lasted 180 days for the post office, US Post Office, selling stamps over the ph-phone, to collectors. And worked as an auditor for \u201cHouse of Ruth\u2019, in DC. And all those weeks I had floated application as an accountant, back for federal employment. And I got a call from the Library of Congress, for a position in my old grade. But, Library of Congress, at that time, the chief told me that they have a huge computer in the basement, which is not utilized at all. And through my experience, they would like me to activate the computer and start it providing data that the computer should be generating, if I want the position. Two days earlier, I got a positive interview with military district of Washington, as an accountant, a grade lower, but asking me to do almost a very similar job that I used to do for Army Material Command, as an accountant. So, I had a choice. Grade higher, but working with a computer, or grade lower, but doing more or less the same accounting job I did before. So I have selected the lower grade.

The Czech government, after the last transport of Jews left from Czechoslovakia to Israel, the Czech government advertised in it\u2019s newspapers and through it\u2019s embassies overseas, that all Czech citizens who will not return to Czechoslovakia by such and such a date, will lose their Czech citizenship. So, I lived under that assumption in Israel, that because I have not returned, I have lost my citizenship. Then, in Israel, upon your arrival, they ask you right in the airport or in the port of you arrival, whether you want to be an Israeli citizen. And if you say yes, from that moment on, you are an Israeli citizen. They don\u2019t care whether you are citizen of another country. From here on, you are an Israeli citizen and you have the right to Israeli passport. One hour after you land in Israel, you are already there a citizen. If you say no, then they let you live as a non-Israeli, but you still have to fulfill the obligations, like any other Israeli. They just don\u2019t trust you as much. Coming to the States, nobody asked me -- I came under the Israeli passport. Working for Army Material Command, there came an opportunity -- they advertised some vacancies -- under the Civil Service in Israel -- if you will remember, when Israel surrendered to Egypt, that desert. What it -- it\u2019s not the Sinai desert, it\u2019s -- yeah, it\u2019s the Sinai desert. When Israel gave back to Egyptian -- to Egypt, Sinai desert, the Americans came that they will finance in Israel some airport which Israelis have lost in Sinai, to Egyptian. And the Civil Service was looking for people who would be willing to go to Israel as servants. So I put application in, but I still had Israeli citizenship and I was afraid that there will arise a conflict. On the one hand, my being Amer-American employee and on the other hand being Israeli citizen. So, I went to Israel1 embassy and I -- I renounced in writing my Israeli citizenship. And as a result, my son and I lost it. We have a letter. My wife never was an Israeli citizen to -- to begin with. But interesting thing now happened. When Czechoslovakia shed it\u2019s Communist flavor, we Czechs here assumed that all of us who left Czechoslovakia from 1948 until today, will gain back Czech citizenship. Matter of fact, gain it back I think was wrong way of phrasing it. I don\u2019t know whether I knew that we lost it. But what came now to light? The new democratic government of Czechoslovakia proclaimed that we are not longer Czech citizenship -- citizens. Because Czechoslovakia and United States signed, in 1928, a mutual treaty whereby -- in which you gain one citizenship, but lose the other one. And the Czechs began to enforce it."

Because, in those days, emigration to the US was orderly. And I was one of the very few that landed in Morrisstown in those days. So people wanted to know more about my experiences as an immigrant and why and how did I make decision coming to the US and how do I feel about the US. But slowly, slowly, with the influx of the Cubans, and the thousands of illegal immigrants, immigrants are somehow looked upon as intruders.
