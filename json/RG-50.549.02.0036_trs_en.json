            "answer": "I have -- People, some of the people know me by four different first names. Why? How did it happen? When I was born, I was born in Lithuania, in a city called Vilnus. My parents were Orthodox Jews. They named me in Yiddish , which was -- the name was in my birth certificate, which was in Yiddish and in Polish, began with the name Labe. Labe in Yiddish means lion. It\u2122s a typical, Jewish sounding name . So, when we came to China, I was three years old and I -- when I was about five, I went to a Russian school to study the Ru-Russian language and all the other subjects. I -- I didn\u2122t want to say that my name was Labe, because it sounded too Jewish, with anti-Semitism and other things, I didn\u2122t want to be outstanding. So when they asked me what my name is, I said, \ufb01My name is Lowah or Leve, which in USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036 3 Russian means lion. That\u2122s how I went thr ough the Russian school. Then, when I was 17, my -- my father told me, said -- advised me -- suggested that I go to studying in a British school in Shanghai to st -- to learn the English language, which he said is important in order to get a job, in order to go ahead in life. So I went to Shanghai, I went to the British school. I didn\u2122t want to tell them neither my Yiddish name nor my Russian name, because it doesn\u2122t sound good. So I said my name, I became Leo, wh ich means, in English, lion, same thing as the other two names. And that\u2122s how I stayed, for many, many, many years, until, in 1948, beginning of \u201a49, we had to leave for Israel. When I came to Israel, I was drafted into the army and when they asked me what my name was, I said, \ufb01Leo.\ufb02 They said, \ufb01Well, you have to change your name, this is not a Hebrew name.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01You, from now on you will be Arie,\ufb02 A-r-i-e, which in Hebrew means lion. So, that\u2122s the same name and that\u2122s how I stayed and I said, \ufb01I don\u2122t want to change it any more.\ufb02 When I came to America, Arie, my social security is Arie, my driver\u2122s license is Arie, everything is Arie. Some people suggested, \ufb01Go on, change it, become Leo.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01No. Enough of that.\ufb02 I had some problems by the way, when I was working on my vi sa to come to the United States, I was in Tokyo -- I will tell you about it later. So, the -- the lady who was asking me questions, her name was Miss Bernard, in the -- in the American embassy, said, \ufb01What is this, how can one man has to have four names?\ufb02 I explained to her, she says, ah, they don\u2122t -- she didn\u2122t -- I said, \ufb01I tell you what. I\u2122ll bring you a letter from the Israeli embassy in Tokyo, that will say that these four names mean the same thing in different languages.\ufb02 That was acceptable. And that\u2122s it. That\u2122s how my name was. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036 4"

The reason why the-they wanted to open an office in Japan -- it was a different Japan in those days, they started copying the British and the French textiles. They used to get samples from overseas and copy them in the Japanese factories and prices were much cheaper, so they said, \ufb01We want to import from Japan. Go to Japan, open an office.\ufb02 I was only what wa -- what was it, \u201a36? 19 - 13 - 23 years old. I opened an office, I decided I have to learn Japanese because I\u2122m dealing with the Japanese. I used to get samples, which I would bring to different manufacturers and they would copy it. Then I would export this merchandise to China. And then that was -- that was that period, that was USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0036 8 \u201a36, then my -- my -- we corresponded with my girlfriend -- my -- my Rebecca and then she said, \ufb01Well, it\u2122s about time we got married.\ufb02 Whatever.

Now, my wife was a young girl, 19 - 20, she was very concerned to give birth in Japan, she didn\u2122t know the hospitals, Japanese doctors, she was used to her mama, you know. And mama was in Shanghai. So she told me, \ufb01I\u2122m going to go back to Shanghai to give birth to our child.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Well, if that\u2122s the way you feel,\ufb02 I wa -- she was afraid, I said, \ufb01Okay.\ufb02 I send her to Japan and there our es -- our son is -- early in 1937, March 29th, was born.

I said, \ufb01What shall I do?\ufb02 \ufb01Well,\ufb02 he says, \ufb01you have any papers? You signed any papers with this man, your partner?\ufb02 I said , \ufb01No, we did it by sh-shaking hands, we are good friends.\ufb02 He says, \ufb01You\u2122re a fool. You don\u2122t do such things in -- in Israel. You have to come to a lawyer, then you\u2122re covered.\ufb02 He says, \ufb01I\u2122ll see what I can do.\ufb02 And in about six months after he ne-negotiated with him a nd we [indecipherable], I closed the office, everything is finished, I\u2122m go -- I go -- I ga -- I went and I got a job in the Israeli customs, I was a customs brok -- customs agen -- not a agent, emp-employee in the office in bookkeeping.
