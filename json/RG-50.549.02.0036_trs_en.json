            "answer": "I have -- People, some of the people know me by four different first names. Why? How did it happen? When I was born, I was born in Lithuania, in a city called Vilnus. My parents were Orthodox Jews. They named me in Yiddish, which was -- the name was in my birth certificate, which was in Yiddish and in Polish, began with the name Labe. Labe in Yiddish means lion. It\u2019s a typical, Jewish sounding name. So, when we came to China, I was three years old and I -- when I was about five, I went to a Russian school to study the Ru-Russian language and all the other subjects. I -- I didn\u2019t want to say that my name was Labe, because it sounded too Jewish, with anti-Semitism and other things, I didn\u2019t want to be outstanding. So when they asked me what my name is, I said, \u201cMy name is Lowah or Leve, which in 36 3 Russian means lion. That\u2019s how I went through the Russian school. Then, when I was 17, my -- my father told me, said -- advised me -- suggested that I go to studying in a British school in Shanghai to st -- to learn the English language, which he said 1s important in order to get a job, in order to go ahead in life. So I went to Shanghai, I went to the British school. I didn\u2019t want to tell them neither my Yiddish name nor my Russian name, because it doesn\u2019t sound good. So I said my name, I became Leo, which means, in English, lion, same thing as the other two names. And that\u2019s how I stayed, for many, many, many years, until, in 1948, beginning of \u201849, we had to leave for Israel. When I came to Israel, I was drafted into the army and when they asked me what my name was, I said, \u201cLeo.\u201d They said, \u201cWell, you have to change your name, this is not a Hebrew name.\u201d He said, \u201cYou, from now on you will be Arie,\u201d A-r-i-e, which in Hebrew means lion. So, that\u2019s the same name and that\u2019s how I stayed and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to change it any more.\u201d\u2019 When I came to America, Arie, my social security is Arie, my driver\u2019s license is Arie, everything is Arie. Some people suggested, \u201cGo on, change it, become Leo.\u201d I said, \u201cNo. Enough of that.\u201d I had some problems by the way, when I was working on my visa to come to the United States, I was in Tokyo -- I will tell you about it later. So, the -- the lady who was asking me questions, her name was Miss Bernard, in the -- in the American embassy, said, \u201c\u201cWhat is this, how can one man has to have four names?\u201d I explained to her, she says, ah, they don\u2019t -- she didn\u2019t -- I said, \u201cI tell you what. Ill bring you a letter from the Israeli embassy in Tokyo, that will say that these four names mean the same thing in different languages.\u201d That was acceptable. And that\u2019s it. That\u2019s how my name was. 36 4"

The reason why the-they wanted to open an office in Japan -- it was a different Japan in those days, they started copying the British and the French textiles. They used to get samples from overseas and copy them in the Japanese factories and prices were much cheaper, so they said, \u201cWe want to import from Japan. Go to Japan, open an office.\u201d I was only what wa -- what was it, \u201836? 19 - 13 - 23 years old. I opened an office, I decided I have to learn Japanese because I\u2019m dealing with the Japanese. I used to get samples, which I would bring to different manufacturers and they would copy it. Then I would export this merchandise to China. And then that was -- that was that period, that was 36 8 \u201836, then my -- my -- we corresponded with my girlfriend -- my -- my Rebecca and then she said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s about time we got married.\u2019 Whatever. So I came back to Shanghai, got married, took her with me to Japan in 1936 and continued with my job. In 1937, after nine months of marriage, my son was born. Now, my wife was a young girl, 19 - 20, she was very concerned to give birth in Japan, she didn\u2019t know the hospitals, Japanese doctors, she was used to her mama, you know. And mama was in Shanghai. So she told me, \u201cI\u2019m going to go back to Shanghai to give birth to our child.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, if that\u2019s the way you feel,\u201d I wa -- she was afraid, I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d I send her to Japan and there our es -- our son is -- early in 1937, March 29th, was born. She was in Shanghai, I was in Japan. And that\u2019s -- And that comes another very interesting cycle in my life. Always in ways, my life is cycles. I was -- Because that brings me to -- to the Fuguclan. You know the book Fuguclan, you read it, didn\u2019t you? Oh, the story of the jap -- of the Jewish refugees in Japan, what I was doing there.

They were organized better than we there, because we were -- very few of us. Anyway, so, as I told you, I was in that -- in that restaurant and I saw three new faces. I sat not far from them and as I was listening to their conversation, they were talking among themselves Yiddish, which was a very rare thing. I got very surprised, and very excited, I came up to them. I speak Yiddish, I talk to them and, \u201cWhat do you doing here, what are you doing here?\u201d They said, \u201cWell, we came here to open an office. We are from 36 10 Panama.

So I came to the boys, I said, \u201cLook, no more going around the nighttime to the nightclubs and then doing things which we were doing, young fellows. My wife is coming home with my son. Goodbye, good luck.\u201d My wife came and I didn\u2019t see them any more, from 1937 to 1939. In 1939, my firm transla -- transferred me back to Shanghai, with my son, my wife, went to Shanghai. He was three years old, went to Shanghai and I was working there, in the office in Shanghai and one day I have a telephone call. The guy speaks to me o-on the telephone, he speaks to me Yiddish.

What are you doing in Shanghai?\u201d 36 11 You know, in those days, this was not so simple. You couldn\u2019t fly by planes, 30 days by boat. It was -- It was a different wor-world. He says, \u201cLook, I\u2019m here already three days and I -- I would like you and your wife to come.

He was managing our office in Japan. He was having a hard time, he didn\u2019t know any English, he didn\u2019t know any Japanese and he decided to go out on his own, to make his own business. We need somebody to run our office. Would you like to come and work with us in Japan?\u201d 1939. War in Europe just -- just- just started. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not -- I have a good job here, I\u2019m not intention -- I have a small baby.\u201d So he smiled. Max was his name.

He opened a big store on the main street in Tokyo, Ginza. Only a few foreign firms, American, British, French, were allowed to import goods in those days. Japanese were not allowed yet. It was before the peace treaty was signed in 1955, I believe. MacArthur. And so he -- he needed someone to help him there and he -- he s -- he send me a telegram. He says, if you want to come and work for me in Tokyo, you\u2019re welcome, I\u2019Il send you a visa. Which he did and I -- in *51 -- at the same time, my youngest son, Danny was a very sick child.

She also wanted to take my -- our oldest son, who was at that time \u201837, \u201847, 16- fif -- 16 years old, but they wouldn\u2019t let him leave, because in a years time he had to go to the army. That was a rule in Israel. So she left to Switzerland with the two children. I went to Japan to work for Mr. Ponvi and Israel stayed behind with my wife\u2019s mother, she looked after him until he had to go to the army, which he did. He was in the 56 year war.
