Or some of them were just \u0152 because the skill of somebody was, let\u2122s say, the county engineer. Well, that\u2122s because he si \u0152 knew how to put in sewer systems. But \u0152 and the \u0152 was \u0152 and I d \u0152 I didn\u2122t get finished with that til after V-E Day , so was lucky when I went overseas, I didn\u2122t have to do any fighting. But I was i nvolved in a lot of interesting episodes. I was in, for instance, typically in my favorite stories, things that happened. There were \u0152 for instance, when there was a security raid in the occupation, because U.S. Army was invo \u0152 [indecipherable] was concerned that the Germans might pull Operation Werwolf. That was the same thing, the name \u0152 tag name they gave to what the French were doing with the Maquis. Resistance. So they tried to undermine it. I know \u0152 so they, sometimes they had ra ids and thing, looking for weapons, and looking for people that were on the [indecipherable] list. And wa \u0152 they had guys like me, assigned to battalion headquarter, an d if they brought in something that was suspicious, I had to give it for a screening. I know one time they brought in a guy with a fancy uniform, brass buttons, and a red cap. And I looked at him and I looked his I.D. and I looked at his brass button, and it said RB, which means Reichsbahn . And said, take that guy back to the railway station, he is the station master. But the normal G.I. wouldn\u2122t know th-that guy from a nother guy with a German uniform."

            "answer": "It was the \u0152 then \u0152 the guy was Alfred Krupp, from the Krupp factory, munitions maker and steel factory. And situation, they were in the Nuremberg trials and I was at a briefing by Supreme Court Justice Jackson , who was the prosecutor for Nuremberg. And I attended one of these meetings ; they said, as you investigate, you gotta look for two things. Cri \u0152 prepar ing for and conducting aggressive warfare. That we found Krupp , because he was building tanks and stuff like that, and testing them, and things of that nature \u0152 othe r war material. The other one was crimes against humanity; slave labor and that kind of stuff. And this ma \u0152 old man, Krupp \u0152 and I have a lot of his personal history, to \u0152 was in \u0152 retired, I think because of health reasons, about the same t \u0152 about the time Paris fell. So that\u2122s before slave labor because a problem. And his son took over. So \u0152 and he and his son didn\u2122t get along at all. And so he had \u0152 the \u0152 the old man didn\u2122t have anything to do with the operation of the factory, or their personnel, or policies. He was there collecting his retirement pay, and that\u2122s about all. In fact, it\u2122s an interesting situation, that this guy is, when he was born, was not \u0152 his name was not Krupp, because old man Krupp , who was very big before World War I, who built up the factory a lot, Alfred Krupp, and he ha \u0152 only had daughter s, he had no sons. But he wanted to perpetuate the name and the family. So the Kaiser had an edict by which the boyfriend, who was Gustav von Bohlen und Halbach, was going to marry the Krupp woman, one of the Krupp daughters, could combine the name, Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach . Interview with Harry Ebert October 16, 2010 30So he maintained his nobility name, but he main \u0152 he kept his \u0152 kept the Krupp name in the family. So there was a special edict, I don\u2122t know what year that was done, but it\u2122s an interesting situation."

            "answer": "Yeah, that was the only one for Nuremberg . But then I worked for \u0152 well, again by the pe \u0152 if I talk about things you know, I me \u0152 stop me. During the Yalta Conference, where they decided the war crime trial concept, said there was people who were involved on an international basis, who were supposed to be tried by the international court, which were then Nuremberg. But things had happened, like concentration camp or slave labor, in the countries whose zone of occupation was \u0152 was war crimes against individuals of that nationality, were supposed to be tried by courts of that ka \u0152 courts of that cor \u0152 of that nationality. For instance, again, there\u2122s an interesting history which is \u0152 don\u2122t know whether \u0152 how well known that was, when the \u0152 when the \u0152 when \u0152 during the fighting, U.S. troops got as far as the Elba river. That meant they went past \u0152 through Th\u00fcringen where the ca \u0152 main town is Interview with Harry Ebert October 16, 2010 31Weimar, and where also Buchenwald was located there, just nearby there. And then, after the \u0152 they rearranged the zones and \u0152 and that area of Weimar became Russian zone. So, since we had the eviden ce, like lampshades made from human bl \u0152 from human skin, and SS guards and oth \u0152 and all kind of stuff, including the wife of the former commandant, Ilse Koch, and \u0152 more about her later. I said I have a long history of \u0152 [indecipherable] history. And so \u0152 so we moved before our troops withdrew from that area, and the Russians moved in. We took all the stuff and put it into a facility in Dachau . We could intern the prisoners and had enough storage facilities to store the evidence. And there was a mission. Since \u0152 since Buchenwald was supposed to be tried by Russia, and since this is the Russian zone, we \u0152 we had a team of about two, three attorneys and about four linguists, who went through all that stuff that had been collected, and they \u0152 the lawyers put it into a legal documentation, to turn over to the Russians, that they could use it as evidence. But the wi \u0152 Russians refused to accept it. They did not want to annoy the Germans. It\u2122s in their zone, they wanted to say the communists are not doing things that Germany look bad. So they refused to do this. And so about \u0152 that was before Churchill spoke about the Iron Curtain . That was Russia did not live up to its commitment under the Yalta Conference. So it\u2122s \u0152 for many years later \u0152 about two years later they would \u0152 the Buchenwald people were tried in American war crimes trial, and I participated in that one. There were some interesting people [indecipherable] were Interview with Harry Ebert October 16, 2010 32there, and later on I got into the war crimes trials in Dachau \u0152 in Dachau . The U.S. trials. And one of the most in \u0152 at times I wasn\u2122t sure I was going to do that. For a while I was either assistant to the prosecutor, assistant to the defense counselor, and was [indecipherable] court interpreter. Was sometimes assistant to the judge, because they had terms, which different people translated different ways. And they were \u0152 the judges were confused and they said, we heard this was said to them, to them, what \u0152 how it happened? And then I ha d to figure out these were the same \u0152 translating it back into German, these were the same organization. So, and \u0152 but there was \u0152 there was some interesting people there. Probably the most famous \u0152 one of the most famous person who was tried there, but he was acquitted, that was Otto Skorzeny . Did you ever heard about that name? Otto Skorzeny was the commander of the German Ranger. In fact, he became famous. After the Italian partisans had cacaptured Mussolini and kept him on top of a mountai n as a prisoner, his ranger unit, with gliders and with mountain troo ps, stormed that place and rescued Mussolini. The partisan got Mussolini couple months later on and they killed him, but \u0152 but that was the guy. And this guy also became famous during the Battle of the Bulge, because he was commanding this ranger, German ranger battalion, and he put them all in German \u0152 in American uniforms, to go behind our lines \u0152 through our lines and disturb things, maybe destroy signal equi pment and put on markers, direction signs, turn them around and to ca \u0152 and they were trying to, during the Battle of the Bulge, Interview with Harry Ebert October 16, 2010 33the aim of the Rumsted(ph) offensive was to capture Antwerp. And he was an important part, but he was being tried \u0152 tried [indecipherable] for that. But there was an interesting thing. The prosecutor was a famous lawyer from Atlanta , who had \u0152 he was usually a defense counselor, an d he lost most of the cases, as defense counselor in war crimes trials. But he was a prosecutor, and he lost that one, because there was a guy who was \u0152 I don\u2122t even know whether he was a lawyer or not, or he had some lawyer assistance. And he fo und out that you cannot get anybody on espionage, or sabotage. These are ruses of war. As long as you are not \u0152 as long as you are caught \u0152 not caught in the other country\u2122s uniform. There were some of his men who were caught in American uniforms, and they were shot. But he was caught later on, I forgot whether in German uniform, or in civilian clothes. Therefore that stopped it and he was acquitted. And then he became other things, he was \u0152 became the chief of security for Egypt. He was sometimes \u0152 there was a \u0152 were some articles written, the most dangerous man in Europe , because he had that wartime experience, and he was helping Egypt . But didn\u2122t do much good. Egyptians didn\u2122t do so well in the Six Day War. But \u0152 so, and then there was also, during the Buchenwald trial, there was this wa \u0152 wa \u0152 fo \u0152 the widow of the commandant, and she had been a widow for many years, but she was pregnant. And they tried to find out whether it was a Polish guard. There were \u0152 a lot of the guard people were Polish DPs. And they were all right. And the Americans pretty well liked them, the only per Interview with Harry Ebert October 16, 2010 34\u0152 only one person didn\u2122t like the Polish guards. There was th \u0152 my dog. He always barked at them. And he was a interesting dog."

            "question": "What kind of dog was it?",
            "answer": "It was a German Shepherd, a relatively small one. But he was very good pedigree, because the couple \u0152 the dogs that bred him, used to belong to the German Field Marshal Mordell, who, when he lost the [indecipherable] in the \u0152 after U.S. troops had moved east of the Rhine river, he committed suicide. Right before that, he gave his matched pair of dogs to a local farme r. And I found out about those dogs. And he bred them, and I got one of his offsprings. Bu t then, the kind of situations that people do \u0152 in the thing, for instance, I was stationed in Dachau that time, and we had took a barrack where we get some veterinarians who were prisoners, and we dro \u0152 got a couple veterinarians and a couple farm boys , and we had a veterinary clinic, because some of us had to go out of town for a coup le of weeks, so we left the dogs there. But they were too \u0152 even too dumb to make sure they had all the medicine, so they died of distemper. Dist \u0152 the medi cine was not easily available in Germany, but we could have send it, call \u0152 contacted our pare nts and have it sent from the States. So the dog did not \u0152 did not survive. But this is \u0152 but lot of the G.I.s had these thing. And by the way, if you keep pe \u0152 these people busy, I was working for a while, that was before that, in an internment camp, where they had people who \u0152 who were not accused of anything, but they were considered security risks, because they had really Interview with Harry Ebert October 16, 2010 35high positions in the party, or in civil service, or in the military. That\u2122s primary \u0152 not in the general army, but in the S.S. or something like that. And they were housed in German army barracks, and they lived better than the population because they had all the heat, the hot water, they had decent food, which was short at that time, but they were bored. So we arranged with them, a craft shop . Some of them were very handy. And I have \u0152 still have at home, four paintings which \u0152 watercolors, about this size, which the guy did from memory, and they are very nice paintings, and I really treasure them. And they were \u0152 didn\u2122t have much stuff, they were [indecipherable] canvas, they were the back of the ration boxes. So they improvised, and I got them home, I got th em framed. And they didn\u2122t want to get paid in money. They said, if you do \u0152 if it\u2122s \u0152 you know, we \u0152 well, it was good relationship between these craftsmen and the G.I.s. They said no, I would appreciate it rather, if you would send a package with some chocolates or some other candy to my wife or to my kids. And we got that at the PX. So it\u2122s, again, the people who had \u0152 we were sorting out who was a real security risk, who was \u0152 on the war crimes wanted list that was put down \u0152 put out by all the countries, sorting things out, and these were primarily the guys, the Ritchie boys. And they were very young guys. I think our detachment commander, he was old, he was 21 years old. He was a second lieutenant. But this \u0152 oh, sorry."

So, since there was a shortage of people, they offered all kind of incentives for people to stay there if they had certain skills. And I stayed there as a civilian, where I made quite a bit more money, but I was a \u0152 they had a uniform for the civilians. So \u0152 and it was important that you wore some service ribbons, that meant you were not a carpetbagger. Some guys, they just went there and never in the service, but th e fact that you were in the service, you were accepted by them. And we could go to the R and R centers in the \u0152 near the Alps and used to have some good times over the weekends. And was on a lake, and early morning there had to be a festival. And then you went on a sailboat. They rigged it for you, you didn\u2122t have to rig it yourself, and then we sailed until lunchtime.

No, this is the \u0152 G.I.s at that particular time, if they could get to those places, the army took good care of them. Except one thing is, there was one of the experiences my wife had. We went to a place where we knew there was an R and R center, we went there, but we did not know that was for blacks. But we asked them whether we could have lunch there.

And one of the things that I wa s really trying to push, and we were successful \u0152 that was during the Cold War era, that we had linguistic training. People training in linguistic and it was all packed military items. We had several reserve units. We were lucky; the Cold War never got hot. We di \u0152 they didn\u2122t have to be called up. Maybe some people got called up during the Berlin crisis, but well, there was not \u0152 then we were prepared, as compared \u0152 and I may be talking politics now, during the Gulf Wars, we had not \u0152 the gov ernment had not prepared linguists who could speak Arabic.

And you learn some of the tricks of the trade of how teaching in a foreign country. For instance, I was giving a course in Japan, and I found a commercial book, or an advert \u0152 actually a catalog by a company that had published the same thing in English and in Japanese. I had the English one, so I got the Japanese one, and got one of those for each of my students from the supplier, and if I wanted a certain graph, maybe I had a slide, but then for the Japanese to read things about it, I would have in there saying E page 42, J page 52, so they could look up the reference material. Plus, the idea of simple sentences. Many p \u0152 and speaking very slowly. If I would have a foreign speaking audience \u0152 foreign language speaking audience, I would sp eak about this pace. And no k \u0152 no complicated sentences, which the French can do the conditionnel. I don\u2122t know whether we use that in English, the conditional case."

I mean, this is the experiences. I said, I lived history, the same way. First time I was in Israel \u0152 in fact, to get there I was \u0152 had been in Pakistan , and I cou \u0152 they couldn\u2122t f \u0152 you couldn\u2122t fly from Pakistan to Israel, so I flew from Pakistan to Teheran , Iran, from \u0152 at that time there was \u0152 the shah was still in command. I \u0152 they could fly from Teheran to Jerusalem. And I decided to do some sightseeing. But I figured, these old things, they have been around that long, fine. But it was my military background, I got myself a guide who was fighting in the Golan Heights , and we we went up the Golan Heights the same way his unit went up. I\u2122m glad they cleared up all the mines. But it was very interesting. That\u2122s another interesting experience dealing with that part of the world. We \u0152 this guy had \u0152 he was Israeli, he had some Arabic friends at one place, and we went there and I got some tea and some dates. Not dates with women, dates the food. And then there were \u0152 near there there was a warehouse, and there were some trucks parked. And these trucks had Israeli license plate, and he said \u0152 they had wing-nuts on them. He said, you loosen one of those wing-nuts. And they had Jordan ese license plates. What happened? They were taking the famous Jaffa oranges \u0152 although it was not in Jaffa , it was farther west, but the same type, and transporting them to the Jordanese \u0152 to the border between Israel and Jordan, then change the license plate, and then Interview with Harry Ebert October 16, 2010 49moved to \u0152 all the way to Saudi, because Saudi had the money and they \u0152 they wanted the \u0152 the better food. So this is a kind of cooperation th at the Israeli were aware what was going on and these Arabic farmers who were growing the oranges up there in [indecipherable] were making some money, and I guess the truck drivers got paid. So it was \u0152 no, I\u2122ve been several times visiting Israel, but that was an interesting experience. Also, from the military point of view, there is a place just east of \u0152 east of Tel Aviv on a mountain called Kenkillya(ph). From there you could fire some of the bigger guns into Tel Aviv . And I think the Israelis made a big mistake of ma \u0152 considering part of the West Bank, they should have annexed that, as a security, to control the high ground. After they found out at the Golan Heights how important the high ground is. So I\u2122m sure they had enou gh people who were studying this thing. And then with the military, I st \u0152 stayed with a co \u0152 [indecipherable] command general staff college, and stuff like that, which is the second highest educational thing within the army. The only higher one is Army War College. I applied for that, but I didn\u2122t \u0152 I couldn\u2122t get in that one. So I \u0152 I had an interesting time there in involvements and stuff like that, and retired as a full [indecipherable] colonel.
