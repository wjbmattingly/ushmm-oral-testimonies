In fact, there\u2019s a very good movie out, was made by a German company, called, \u201cThe Ritchie Boys,\u201d and what happened, 1-it was quite \u2014 it was very fair. They took people who had a certain high I.Q. \u2014 I forgot what the army called the thing right now \u2014 and they were fluent in a language that was of interest; German or Italian or French. We were not that much concerned with eastern European languages. And they had a similar thing on the west coast, in br \u2014 in Monterey, for people who were \u2014 were interested in Asiatic languages, and getting involved there. So I got to that camp, which they cou \u2014on my orders I\u2019d even \u2014 couldn\u2019t even say where I\u2019m going to. And that movie they made about it, I don\u2019t know whether Holocaust Museum has \u2014 hat that, it\u2019s \u2014 but it\u2019s \u2014 but it\u2019s a very interesting link. And these people did all kind of jobs, interrogation of prisoners during wa \u2014 during the fighting. And the most famous attendee of that school was Henry Kissinger. But he graduated from there before I \u2014 I went there. And what happened? We \u2014 when we were finished, we knew more about the German military, the civil service, the reliability, things, when people were \u2014 were promoted on certain jobs, they had certain jobs, which ones were considered Interview with Harry Ebert ot October 16, 2010 highly \u2014 higher the liability for the Nazi regime. Or some of them were just \u2014 because the skill of somebody was, let\u2019s say, the county engineer. Well, that\u2019s because he si \u2014 knew how to put in sewer systems. But \u2014 and the \u2014 was \u2014 and I d\u2014I didn\u2019t get finished with that til after V-E Day, so was lucky when I went overseas, I didn\u2019t have to do any fighting. But I was involved in a lot of interesting episodes. I was in, for instance, typically in my favorite stories, things that happened. There were \u2014 for instance, when there was a security raid in the occupation, because U.S. Army was invo \u2014 [indecipherable] was concerned that the Germans might pull Operation Werwolf. That was the same thing, the name \u2014 tag name they gave to what the French were doing with the Maquis. Resistance. So they tried to undermine it. I know \u2014 so they, sometimes they had raids and thing, looking for weapons, and looking for people that were on the [indecipherable] list. And wa \u2014 they had guys like me, assigned to battalion headquarter, and if they brought in something that was suspicious, I had to give it for a screening. I know one time they brought in a guy with a fancy uniform, brass buttons, and a red cap. And I looked at him and I looked his I.D. and I looked at his brass button, and it said RB, which means Reichsbahn. And said, take that guy back to the railway station, he is the station master. But the normal G.I. wouldn\u2019t know th-that guy from another guy with a German uniform."

            "answer": "It was the \u2014 then \u2014 the guy was Alfred Krupp, from the Krupp factory, munitions maker and steel factory. And situation, they were in the Nuremberg trials and I was at a briefing by Supreme Court Justice Jackson, who was the prosecutor for Nuremberg. And I attended one of these meetings; they said, as you investigate, you gotta look for two things. Cri \u2014 preparing for and conducting aggressive warfare. That we found Krupp, because he was building tanks and stuff like that, and testing them, and things of that nature \u2014 other war material. The other one was crimes against humanity; slave labor and that kind of stuff. And this ma \u2014 old man, Krupp \u2014and I have a lot of his personal history, to \u2014 was in \u2014 retired, I think because of health reasons, about the same t \u2014 about the time Paris fell. So that\u2019s before slave labor because a problem. And his son took over. So \u2014 and he and his son didn\u2019t get along at all. And so he had \u2014 the \u2014 the old man didn\u2019t have anything to do with the operation of the factory, or their personnel, or policies. He was there collecting his retirement pay, and that\u2019s about all. In fact, it\u2019s an interesting situation, that this guy is, when he was born, was not \u2014 his name was not Krupp, because old man Krupp, who was very big before World War I, who built up the factory a lot, Alfred Krupp, and he ha \u2014 only had daughters, he had no sons. But he wanted to perpetuate the name and the family. So the Kaiser had an edict by which the boyfriend, who was Gustav von Bohlen und Halbach, was going to marry the Krupp woman, one of the Krupp daughters, could combine the name, Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach. Interview with Harry Ebert * October 16, 2010 So he maintained his nobility name, but he main \u2014 he kept his \u2014 kept the Krupp name in the family. So there was a special edict, I don\u2019t know what year that was done, but it\u2019s an interesting situation."

During the Yalta Conference, where they decided the war crime trial concept, said there was people who were involved on an international basis, who were supposed to be tried by the international court, which were then Nuremberg. But things had happened, like concentration camp or slave labor, in the countries whose zone of occupation was \u2014 was war crimes against individuals of that nationality, were supposed to be tried by courts of that ka \u2014 courts of that cor \u2014 of that nationality. For instance, again, there\u2019s an interesting history which is \u2014 don\u2019t know whether \u2014 how well known that was, when the \u2014 when the \u2014 when \u2014 during the fighting, U.S. troops got as far as the Elba river. That meant they went past \u2014 through Thuringen where the ca \u2014 main town is Interview with Harry Ebert * October 16, 2010 Weimar, and where also Buchenwald was located there, just nearby there. And then, after the \u2014 they rearranged the zones and \u2014 and that area of Weimar became Russian zone. So, since we had the evidence, like lampshades made from human bl \u2014 from human skin, and SS guards and oth \u2014 and all kind of stuff, including the wife of the former commandant, Ilse Koch, and \u2014 more about her later. I said I have a long history of \u2014 [indecipherable] history. And so \u2014 so we moved before our troops withdrew from that area, and the Russians moved in. We took all the stuff and put it into a facility in Dachau. We could intern the prisoners and had enough storage facilities to store the evidence. And there was a mission. Since \u2014 since Buchenwald was supposed to be tried by Russia, and since this is the Russian zone, we \u2014 we had a team of about two, three attorneys and about four linguists, who went through all that stuff that had been collected, and they \u2014 the lawyers put it into a legal documentation, to turn over to the Russians, that they could use it as evidence. But the wi \u2014 Russians refused to accept it. They did not want to annoy the Germans. It\u2019s in their zone, they wanted to say the communists are not doing things that Germany look bad. So they refused to do this. And so about \u2014 that was before Churchill spoke about the Iron Curtain. That was Russia did not live up to its commitment under the Yalta Conference. So it\u2019s \u2014 for many years later \u2014 about two years later they would \u2014 the Buchenwald people were tried in American war crimes trial, and I participated in that one. There were some interesting people [indecipherable] were Interview with Harry Ebert * October 16, 2010 there, and later on I got into the war crimes trials in Dachau \u2014 in Dachau. The U.S. trials. And one of the most in \u2014 at times I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to do that. For a while I was either assistant to the prosecutor, assistant to the defense counselor, and was [indecipherable] court interpreter. Was sometimes assistant to the judge, because they had terms, which different people translated different ways. And they were \u2014 the judges were confused and they said, we heard this was said to them, to them, what \u2014 how it happened? And then I had to figure out these were the same \u2014 translating 1t back into German, these were the same organization. So, and \u2014 but there was \u2014 there was some interesting people there. Probably the most famous \u2014 one of the most famous person who was tried there, but he was acquitted, that was Otto Skorzeny. Did you ever heard about that name\u2019? Otto Skorzeny was the commander of the German Ranger. In fact, he became famous. After the Italian partisans had ca- captured Mussolini and kept him on top of a mountain as a prisoner, his ranger unit, with gliders and with mountain troops, stormed that place and rescued Mussolini. The partisan got Mussolini couple months later on and they killed him, but \u2014 but that was the guy. And this guy also became famous during the Battle of the Bulge, because he was commanding this ranger, German ranger battalion, and he put them all in German \u2014 in American uniforms, to go behind our lines \u2014 through our lines and disturb things, maybe destroy signal equipment and put on markers, direction signs, turn them around and to ca \u2014 and they were trying to, during the Battle of the Bulge, Interview with Harry Ebert \u201c October 16, 2010 the aim of the Rumsted(ph) offensive was to capture Antwerp. And he was an important part, but he was being tried \u2014 tried [indecipherable] for that. But there was an interesting thing. The prosecutor was a famous lawyer from Atlanta, who had \u2014 he was usually a defense counselor, and he lost most of the cases, as defense counselor in war crimes trials. But he was a prosecutor, and he lost that one, because there was a guy who was \u2014 I don\u2019t even know whether he was a lawyer or not, or he had some lawyer assistance. And he found out that you cannot get anybody on espionage, or sabotage. These are ruses of war. As long as you are not \u2014 as long as you are caught \u2014 not caught in the other country\u2019s uniform. There were some of his men who were caught in American uniforms, and they were shot. But he was caught later on, I forgot whether in German uniform, or in civilian clothes. Therefore that stopped it and he was acquitted. And then he became other things, he was \u2014 became the chief of security for Egypt. He was sometimes \u2014 there was a \u2014 were some articles written, the most dangerous man in Europe, because he had that wartime experience, and he was helping Egypt. But didn\u2019t do much good. Egyptians didn\u2019t do so well in the Six Day War. But \u2014 so, and then there was also, during the Buchenwald trial, there was this wa \u2014 wa \u2014 fo \u2014 the widow of the commandant, and she had been a widow for many years, but she was pregnant. And they tried to find out whether it was a Polish guard. There were \u2014 a lot of the guard people were Polish DPs. And they were all right. And the Americans pretty well liked them, the only per Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Harry Ebert ~ October 16, 2010 \u2014 only one person didn\u2019t like the Polish guards. There was th \u2014 my dog. He always barked at them. And he was a interesting dog."

            "question": "What kind of dog was it?",
            "answer": "It was a German Shepherd, a relatively small one. But he was very good pedigree, because the couple \u2014 the dogs that bred him, used to belong to the German Field Marshal Mordell, who, when he lost the [indecipherable] in the \u2014 after U.S. troops had moved east of the Rhine river, he committed suicide. Right before that, he gave his matched pair of dogs to a local farmer. And I found out about those dogs. And he bred them, and I got one of his offsprings. But then, the kind of situations that people do \u2014 in the thing, for instance, I was stationed in Dachau that time, and we had took a barrack where we get some veterinarians who were prisoners, and we dro \u2014 got a couple veterinarians and a couple farm boys, and we had a veterinary clinic, because some of us had to go out of town for a couple of weeks, so we left the dogs there. But they were too \u2014 even too dumb to make sure they had all the medicine, so they died of distemper. Dist \u2014 the medicine was not easily available in Germany, but we could have send it, call \u2014 contacted our parents and have it sent from the States. So the dog did not \u2014 did not survive. But this 1s \u2014 but lot of the G.I.s had these thing. And by the way, if you keep pe \u2014 these people busy, I was working for a while, that was before that, in an internment camp, where they had people who \u2014 who were not accused of anything, but they were considered security risks, because they had really Interview with Harry Ebert * October 16, 2010 high positions in the party, or in civil service, or in the military. That\u2019s primary \u2014 not in the general army, but in the S.S. or something like that. And they were housed in German army barracks, and they lived better than the population because they had all the heat, the hot water, they had decent food, which was short at that time, but they were bored. So we arranged with them, a craft shop. Some of them were very handy. And I have \u2014 still have at home, four paintings which \u2014 watercolors, about this size, which the guy did from memory, and they are very nice paintings, and I really treasure them. And they were \u2014 didn\u2019t have much stuff, they were [indecipherable] canvas, they were the back of the ration boxes. So they improvised, and I got them home, I got them framed. And they didn\u2019t want to get paid in money. They said, if you do \u2014 if it\u2019s \u2014 you know, we \u2014 well, it was good relationship between these craftsmen and the G.L.s. They said no, I would appreciate it rather, if you would send a package with some chocolates or some other candy to my wife or to my kids. And we got that at the PX. So it\u2019s, again, the people who had \u2014 we were sorting out who was a real security risk, who was \u2014 on the war crimes wanted list that was put down \u2014 put out by all the countries, sorting things out, and these were primarily the guys, the Ritchie boys. And they were very young guys. I think our detachment commander, he was old, he was 21 years old. He was a second lieutenant. But this \u2014 oh, sorry."

So \u2014 and it was important that you wore some service ribbons, that meant you were not a carpetbagger.

For instance, I was giving a course in Japan, and I found a commercial book, or an advert \u2014 actually a catalog by a company that had published the same thing in English and in Japanese. I had the English one, so I got the Japanese one, and got one of those for each of my students from the supplier, and if I wanted a certain graph, maybe I had a slide, but then for the Japanese to read things about it, I would have in there saying E page 42, J page 52, so they could look up the reference material. Plus, the idea of simple sentences. Many p \u2014 and speaking very slowly. If I would have a foreign speaking audience \u2014 foreign language speaking audience, I would speak about this pace.

First time I was in Israel \u2014 in fact, to get there I was \u2014 had been in Pakistan, and I cou \u2014 they couldn\u2019t f \u2014 you couldn\u2019t fly from Pakistan to Israel, so I flew from Pakistan to Teheran, Iran, from \u2014 at that time there was \u2014 the shah was still in command. I \u2014 they could fly from Teheran to Jerusalem. And I decided to do some sightseeing. But I figured, these old things, they have been around that long, fine. But it was my military background, I got myself a guide who was fighting in the Golan Heights, and we we went up the Golan Heights the same way his unit went up. I\u2019m glad they cleared up all the mines. But it was very interesting. That\u2019s another interesting experience dealing with that part of the world. We \u2014 this guy had \u2014 he was Israeli, he had some Arabic friends at one place, and we went there and I got some tea and some dates. Not dates with women, dates the food. And then there were \u2014 near there there was a warehouse, and there were some trucks parked. And these trucks had Israeli license plate, and he said \u2014 they had wing-nuts on them. He said, you loosen one of those wing-nuts. And they had Jordanese license plates. What happened? They were taking the famous Jaffa oranges \u2014 although it was not in Jaffa, it was farther west, but the same type, and transporting them to the Jordanese \u2014 to the border between Israel and Jordan, then change the license plate, and then Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Harry Ebert \u201d October 16, 2010 moved to \u2014 all the way to Saudi, because Saudi had the money and they \u2014 they wanted the \u2014 the better food. So this is a kind of cooperation that the Israeli were aware what was going on and these Arabic farmers who were growing the oranges up there in [indecipherable] were making some money, and I guess the truck drivers got paid. So it was \u2014 no, I\u2019ve been several times visiting Israel, but that was an interesting experience. Also, from the military point of view, there is a place just east of \u2014 east of Tel Aviv on a mountain called Kenkillya(ph). From there you could fire some of the bigger guns into Tel Aviv. And I think the Israelis made a big mistake of ma \u2014 considering part of the West Bank, they should have annexed that, as a security, to control the high ground. After they found out at the Golan Heights how important the high ground is. So I\u2019m sure they had enough people who were studying this thing. And then with the military, I st \u2014 stayed with a co \u2014 [indecipherable] command general staff college, and stuff like that, which is the second highest educational thing within the army. The only higher one is Army War College. I applied for that, but I didn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t get in that one. So I\u2014 I had an interesting time there in involvements and stuff like that, and retired as a full [indecipherable] colonel.
