When you came here, we wanted not to forget, but we wanted not to think, not to have the nightmares. So work, work, work, work. I worked two shifts. When I went to university, you know, I still -- that was my native language. You very simply tried to do whatever you could -- I mean -- and -- and I remember in the school, in the pharmacy school, where they are saying these things \"I was on top of my class.\" I mean, look -- people like -- there were two or three. I mean, the older people -- I was in my 20's -- what we are, there are finals. A week before we have a big dance, and they are sitting and studying, you know? It isn't fair. Well, but that, you know, you wanted. You wanted to be busy, busy, busy. I did things besides going to school. When we came here, I was -- I worked in the neighborhood, and I -- I was the one who established -- we collected money, Neighborhood Tutor Organization Training Leader Conference in Wisconsin. And what we did, we financed this, collected the money. I was busy. I was busy, because simply you wanted to be involved in something, not just to be sitting. But there was a many nights. And German don't understand this -- or maybe they do -- you wake up all sweated because you have a nightmare. I -- I -- the boy what I told you who died, I was - well, I -- I -- I knew him, but you know he was another boy in the class. He was the oldest son had a relatively young father. I remember when I -- when they liberated me after four or five days, I found a big stick, and I supported myself. I said, I was looking for, \"Maybe I'll recognize some face.\" And her father, he called me in and said, \"Did you?\" I said, \"Yes, I was with your son in Kaufering in Da -- in the various subcamps. And the guy just squeezed my hand. \"I won't live till tomorrow. Tell me that my son is alive.\" I couldn't tell him that his son was dead. I said, \"Yes, he is alive, but I'll come tomorrow.\" Tomorrow he was dead. I mean, and this things -- you know, hounds you. Not many times, but if this -- it 1s hard to take, but life goes on. You see, I have two kids. And they know. I mean, I told them. But they cannot understand. Well, they can understand, and they cannot understand. And my son is a nuclear engineer. He is in charge of nuclear reactor here behind the navy. My daughter 1s vice president of a large pharmaceutical company. And they have their lives. They know from -- I really wasn't talking to them, because I felt that they would never understand how just frightened as a children. But they know. My daughter was very active in the neighborhood. You know they go. They visit Holocaust Museum. But --"

            "answer": "-- no problem. But in the village -- there was mixed village -- Ukrainian and Poles. And, after her par -- her father escape, he was in Parczew[?] with me. There were five, six people with guns, and they survive in the woods. He lived through liberation. He died here. And there were -- so they said that -- oh, and so, who saved her was their maid. She worked for the Gentile maid. She worked for them for 15 years. And she went to her village. But what -- but, when she would have grown up and talked to the neighbors, she just opened her mouth, they would know that she's not a girl -- deceased girl from a little Polish village. And Ukrainians (indecipherable) her and (indecipherable) her sponsor. So, when she wrote that this and this, she said \"Well, how come she has the papers and she has to hide and this?\" She said, \"To hell with you -- I don't want the money,\" and she dropped it. She got some money later from Germany. They give $5,000 to every survivor -- that she got. But for the indemnity -- what she went as a halfway -- she said she's not going to go into it, it will tear her apart. Her mother was a pharmacist. The father paid somebody to drive a carriage, and he was supposed to meet them. She never made it. Her sister was dark. Her mother looked Jewish. The sister was dark-eyed. She was still some place on the way. And he survived in the forest. The men slept for two years on snow -- period. They stole few potatoes. The Poles -- the Polish farmers were afraid to tell Germans, because they're afraid that the people who survive will set their house on fire. So later, when the Russian liberated him, they sent him in the army. They took one look at this man and said, \"He cannot serve in the army.\" And they sent him to Siberia to work as an accountant in a -- and that was not bad, she said. He walked three miles a day to here through the snow. Finally he got sick. Some Russian soldiers brought her, and he get reunited after the war with my wife. She wanted to go back. She wanted to go back. When she -- when the war ended, the village was about five or eight miles away from her town in Lewino [?] , so she went. And all she said that the house was bombed, her broken bicycle was laid. And she started to sit down to cry. So some neighbors came and said, \"Look, there are some Jewish survivors. They live here and there.\" When she went there -- and she didn't know her father survived. She wanted to go back. Because what happened to the woman, she took her to a priest. And she said, \"I'll tell you something. She doesn't look Jewish. If nobody survives, raise her as a Catholic. If her parents survive, let her go to her people.\" Well, she never found. She said, \"I'm going to go back.\" She said, \"No, no -- you don't go back. Not only kill you, they'll also kill the girl who sheltered you.\" So anyway, she later got reunited when he was sick, brought back with her father and her cousin. And we met in Germany. She was studying in Munich. I was studying Frankfurt am Main. But I was member of executive board of Jewish student unions in Germany. So, when I came over there, I met her through another girl. Well, we dated after -- we married in 1948."
