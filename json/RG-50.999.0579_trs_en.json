My\nname is Bill Benson. | am the host of the museum's public program, First Person. Thank you for joining\nus. We are in our 17th year of the First Person program. Our First Person today is Mr. Frank\nLiebermann, whom we shall meet shortly.\nThis 2016 season of First Person is made possible by the generosity of the Louis Franklin\nSmith Foundation, with additional funding from the Arlene and Daniel Fisher Foundation. We are\ngrateful for their sponsorship.\nFirst Person is a series of conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share with us their\nfirsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each of our First Person guests serves as\na volunteer here at this museum. Our program will continue through mid-August. The museum's\nwebsite, www.ushmm.org, provides information about each of our upcoming First Person guests.\nAnyone interested in keeping in touch with the museum and its programs can complete the\nStay Connected card in your program or speak with a museum representative at the back of the\ntheater. In doing so, you will receive an electronic copy of Frank Liebermann's biography so that you\ncan remember and share his testimony after you leave here today.\nFrank will share us his \"First Person\" account of his experience during the Holocaust and as a\nsurvivor for about 45 minutes. If time allows, we will have an opportunity for you to ask Frank questions.\nThe life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about to hear\nfrom Frank is one individual's account of the Holocaust. We have prepared a brief slide presentation to\nhelp with his introduction.\nWe begin with this photograph of Frank Liebermann. He was born in Gliwice, Germany, now\nin Poland, in 1929. Frank was about 4 years old when this photograph was taken.\nFrank was the only child of Hans and Lotte Lieberman. On the left we see Hans Liebermann\nand on the right we see Lotte and her first granddaughter, Joannie.\nBoth of Frank's parents\u2019 families had lived in that part of Germany, again, now Poland, for\nseveral generations. Frank is pictured here with his paternal grandparents, Bernard and Jenny\nLiebermann.\nHitler came to power in 1933. When Frank began school in 1935, Jewish students were\nseparated from the non-Jewish students and fear of anti-Semitic attacks became frequent. Pictured\nhere is Frank's first grade class on the first day of school. The cones they are holding contain sweets to\nmake school sweet. Frank is in the second row, the fourth from the right.\nIn 1936, Frank's father was no longer able to practice medicine as a result of anti-Jewish laws.\nIn 1938, the family tried to obtain visas to come to the United States. Hans traveled first and Frank and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n2\nis mother followed a few months later in October of 1938. Here we see Frank's mother's ticket for the\nship they took to the United States.\nThe Liebermann family settled in Ohio and Frank went on to graduate from Western Reserve,\nnow Case Western Reserve University, in 1950 with a degree in chemistry.\nFrank graduated from college in 1950 and started a long and successful career in the textile\nindustry in New York City. In that same year he married Marianne, his wife of nearly 66 years. Frank\nworked in textile manufacturing until 1992 when he and Marianne moved to the Washington, DC area\nto be closer to their children. Frank lasted three months in retirement before going into the travel\nbusiness which he continues today, specializing in Europe and U.S. travel, including Alaska. He\nrecently joined a new agency, Signature Travel in Maryland. And he went to work this morning before\nhe came here.\nFrank and Marianne have three children, two daughters and a son. Their daughters, Nancy\nand Joan, live in this area and their son Jerry is in Seattle. They have five grandchildren with the\nyoungest about to turn 25. As Frank notes, three of them are gainfully employed, one will graduate from\nHarvard Law School next June, and the other, after being a teaching assistant at Maastricht University\nin the Netherlands, is now working on his Ph.D. in Modern European History at the University of Suffolk\nin Brighton, England.\nFrank's daughters Joannie and Nancy are here today with him along with other family\nmembers and friends.\nFrank volunteers with the Museum's Visitor Services where you will find him here Thursday\nmornings. As part of his responsibilities, he soeaks with various groups visiting the museum. He also\nhas spoken to wounded veterans at the recently closed Walter Reed Hospital.\nWith that, I'd like you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Mr. Frank Liebermann.\n>> [Applause]\n>> Bill Benson: Frank, thank you so much for joining us today and for being willing to be our First\nPerson. We have a short hour with so much to share so we'll start right away.\nYou told me, Frank, that your earliest memories start in 1934 when you were 5 years old. You\nsaid also of that time that all in all it was a good time for your parents. Tell us why that was so and what\nyou can about your family and their life in Gliwice and what you know about yourself in that time in\nthose first five years.\n>> Frank Lieberman: We lived in Gliwice, which was approximately half way between my\ngrandparents. My mother's family lived a little bit further west and my father's family a little further east.\nAnd my parents settled in the middle. My father was a ear, nose, throat surgeon.\nBasically in childhood, | felt very fortunate. | think in 1933, my parents got a car which was\nvery unusual since we lived in the middle of town, which was common. On a streetcar line, my father\nwent to the hospital, on the street car, made house calls in the same way with public transportation. He\nhad an office on the main street, equivalent of something like Connecticut Avenue. The first three\nrooms in the front were his office, waiting room, and living room, and in the back was the dining room\nand three bedrooms, an apartment, so that he had a half-minute walk to the office.\n>> [Laughter]\n>> Bill Benson: Frank, your family had lived in the area for a very long time. | think your mother's family\nwent back centuries. Is that right?\n>> Frank Lieberman: Yes. My mother's family celebrated the 100th anniversary of the family business,\nwhich was a wholesale leather and tannery business, in 1933. When Hitler came along,\nbasically -- when my father lost his hospital privileges, my grandfather tried to persuade him to move to\na larger city. He could take care of them. After all, they survived World War | with starvation; they've\nbeen in the community; this would blow over. My father turned that down because he was independent\nand he didn't want -- he wanted to make his own way and started looking for ways of getting out of\nGermany.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n3\n>> Bill Benson: I'm going to keep us in that time for a moment more. You started school in 1935,\nstarted attending a public school. You said to me that the most dangerous time for you was recess. Can\nyou Say a little bit about that?\n>> Frank Lieberman: We had to leave the building during recess. We had three rooms in a large public\nschool. At recess we had to go into a large playground area. We tried to be very close to our teachers.\nBoys and girls were separate. And the line in between, there was a lot of heckling. It was definitely the\nmost uncomfortable part of the day.\n>> Bill Benson: In 1936, circumstances for your parents turned more ominous and they became more\ndifficult if not dangerous. What changed in 1936? What did that mean for your family and for you?\n>> Frank Lieberman: After World War | there was the Crimean War which involved the Rafians [ph]\nand led, at the end of it, led to the formation of Poland. Poland basically only became -- again became\na country, after the treaty of 1921 which included the Gdansk corridor. It included a treaty which\nprotected minorities, both German and Polish, in former German territories, for 15 years, which ended\nIn 1936.\nThe Nazis didn't really take full control until that treaty expired, in order to protect their\npopulation on the Polish side. But once the treaty was over, stores started being boycotted. They had\nbrown shirts, blockading my father's office. He lost his hospital privileges. And you had an anti-Semitic\nmagazine, newspaper, at every street corner, behind glass. Things really turned bad almost\nimmediately the day after the treaty.\n>> Bill Benson: In that same year, in 1936, | believe your mother made a trip to Israel for a specific\npurpose. What did she go there for?\n>> Frank Lieberman: Well, as | said, my father did not want to accept my grandfather's offer so they\nstarted investigating where to go. It turned out that Israel was not a possibility. She went with her\nbrother. There was one doctor for every 100 people. It was impossible for a Jew to practice medicine.\nDoctors became chicken farmers. That was not one of the choices. This is why my grandfather\nfound -- became a genealogist and started looking up family histories to see if there are any other\nplaces which might offer refuge.\nIt turned out that he found a brother-in-law on my mother's side had moved to the United\nStates in 1905. After an unfortunate incident that he said he needed 5,000 marks, which was in the six\nfigures in dollars. For one week he had a problem. He got it and went to the United States. Never to be\nseen again. He did find that. My grandfather said try it, maybe there will be some retribution.\nHe did take a trip in 1938.\n>> Bill Benson: Before we come to that, 1938, a couple of other questions. Your parents insisted -- it\nwas urgent you learn to swim. Tell us about that.\n>> Frank Lieberman: Yes. Again, they said we would probably have to take an ocean voyage. The\nswimming pool would be closed after the end of the treaty. My grandfather went with me, | think about a\nweek before and saw to it that | swam in deep water and he didn't leave until that was done. So |\nenjoyed my ability to swim ever since. But it had a rather ominous beginning.\n>> Bill Benson: You told me that you've been able to document or see the decline in your\ngrandparents\u2019 business, | think between 1933 and 1936 or so and it was dramatic, wasn't it? You\nmeasured the dollar loss.\n>> Frank Lieberman: Well, dollar loss -- nothing has the same value but -- now | have to add. They had\na non-Jewish accountant who kept the books. They did locate him afterwards. The accounting figures, |\ngave them to the Holocaust Museum because it shows the rapid decline from about $100,000 -- | forget\nwhat the amount is, in 1933, to about 20 in 1938 when the business was confiscated on Kristallnacht,\nwhich was the Night of Broken Glass.\n>> Bill Benson: When your father lost his admitting privileges and his practice was boycotted, how was\nhe able to make ends meet for the family before he left for the U.S.?\n>> Frank Lieberman: First of all, we lived very frugally. Money wasn't worth anything because bank\naccounts were frozen for anything but assigned living expenses. So we basically worked from whatever\nsavings there were, with some help from my grandparents.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n4\n>> Bill Benson: And as you were beginning to tell us, your grandfather had located a relative who had\ncome to the United States in 1905 and that led to your father making a trip to the U.S. in January of\n1938 and then moving to the United States later that year. Tell us what happened there.\n>> Frank Lieberman: He had two stops. One was in Philadelphia, in the City Hall, where the\nfamily -- one of the family married and came to the United States and settled in Philadelphia in the early\n1700s, became quite prominent, one of the financiers of the revolution, started a college in\nPhiladelphia. He was hoping to find some trace of the family which could help. It turned out that\nRebecca [Indiscernible] never married and her brother moved out west. Out west was Louisville,\nKentucky.\n>> [Laughter]\n>> Frank Lieberman: He married but the family lost track and that was an area that was not -- there he\nwasn't successful.\nThe son of the person who absconded the money was vice president of an organization, gave\nhim an affidavit which was necessary to guarantee that we would not be on welfare for a year.\nRemember, this was 1938, in the midst of the second phase of the great depression. At that time,\nincluded in the affidavit, he had an income of $38,000, which was about as obscene as some of the big\nfigures nowadays. And that did permit us to get on the quota for the United States where we got a\nnumber right after his return in 1938, in January. Then nothing happened. Started checking. It was\nFebruary, March, April. He called a friend and said, \u201cWhat do | do? | really need to move.: And he said,\nwell, the council had a secretary, Fraulein Schmidt. \u201cI've heard if you get her a nice box of candy, that\nmight help.\u201d And | want to mention that in bad times, corruption is rampant. Because people are\ndesperate. Again, for about another month nothing happened.\n>> Bill Benson: And he sent the chocolates.\n>> Frank Liebermann: He took the chocolates.\n>> Bill Benson: Ok.\n>> Frank Liebermann: And he called his friend again and said, \u201cLook, I'm getting really anxious.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cWell, did you put 100 marks into the box of candy?\u201d\n>> Bill Benson: He did take another box of candy.\n>> Frank Liebermann: He did.\n>> [Laughter]\n>> Frank Liebermann: And in June, we were called to Berlin to have a physical at the American\nEmbassy. We got our visa promptly. And the visa is good for 120 days. You could only take out 10\nmarks, which is about $2.50. By today's standards that's probably about $50. But there was an angle\nthat if you took a German boat and went first class, you got a pretty good, what do you call it, soending\nallowance for the gift shops but if you didn't spend it, you could turn it into American dollars.\nMy father took the next boat and went straight to Ohio which the bar passed half of the\npeople. He had a friend who was a gynecologist in Cleveland, was a fraternity brother, who mentioned\nthe 50%. My father was a gambler and got a room for $5 a week, spent the time at the medical library\nto hone up, registered for the December state boards. And since the visa was good for 120 days, we\nbooked at the end of 120 days, on the 12th of October.\n>> Bill Benson: Frank, why didn't you go when your father went? Because he left in June.\n>> Frank Liebermann: To save money.\n>> Bill Benson: Ok.\n>> Frank Liebermann: In other words, he wasn't able to earn a living. My mother closed the household.\nYou could pay 100% tax on anything that you took out so that we were able to pack furniture. My\nmother got a sewing machine in case she needed -- she was good at sewing.\n>> Bill Benson: But she had to pay 100% tax.\n>> Frank Liebermann: 100% tax to the government on what anything was worth. But with that we got a\nlift, which is something like a container, which could be packed with somebody supervising that\neverything was being taken out. We basically gave up our apartment. We stayed in a furnished room\nduring that time; again, to save anything possible and get ready for a family reunion in October.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n5\n>> Bill Benson: And during that time, in the summer of 1938, while you're waiting for your departure,\nsomewhere along the line you had an accident and broke your arm. Tell us about that.\n>> Frank Liebermann: Kids play tag.\n>> [Laughter]\n>> Frank Liebermann: My mother called the local orthopedist whom they had gone to medical dinners\nwith, etc., that said, \u201cSorry, | don't take care of Jewish patients.\u201d So she got frantically on to the phone\nand found an orthopedist in my grandfather's town, Boynton. He said, look, take a taxi, go to the\nbackdoor of the Catholic orphanage. She gave the address. :Go into the freight entrance, I'll meet you\nat the orphanage.\u201d He took a quick minute. He set my arm, put on a cast, and gave instructions to my\npediatric doctor on what to do after the cast comes off. And basically she did that. My left arm now\nbends a little bit further than my right arms are, so she did a very good job. [Laughter]\n>> Bill Benson: But that's what it took for you to get your broken arm stain care of.\n>> Frank Liebermann: Yeah.\n>> Bill Benson: So with your mother dealing with things like that, trying to close up the household,\ntrying as humanly possible to save money to prepare to leave, that had to be just an incredibly stressful\ntime for her during those four months with your father gone.\n>> Frank Liebermann: It was. But, look, under the circumstances, you do what has to be done and the\nresults were positive. | was blessed with very strong parents.\n>> Bill Benson: You're leaving for Bremerhaven, | believe, in 1938.\n>> Frank Liebermann: | have to interrupt. You have all heard of the Munich conference? This\nwas -- Hitler gave some demands on France and England. There was a conference between Prime\nMinister Chamberlain, the French, Prime Minister Daladier and Munich during which Hitler demanded\nthe German-speaking part of land where the giant mountains on the German border and Chamberlain\nand Daladier gave into Hitler and basically gave away part of Czechoslovakia without their consent.\nWhich was unbelievable at the time. Although we didn't know anything about this. Censorship was\ncomplete. There was no internet. There was complete censorship of the press. You weren't allowed to\nlisten to foreign broadcasts.\nBy the way, during that time, Hitler called back all ships at sea with the threat of war.\nWe took the train. We said goodbye to my grandparents. We went to Berlin to have our\npassport stamped with the day to make sure that we don't come back. It was instigated by the Swiss\nwho wanted to make sure that they are not getting any Jewish refugees. It became necessary to do that\nto emigrate.\nWe went on to Bremen. When we got to Bremen, there was no ship. Because the Europa,\nwhich was where we were booked, had been called back and was delayed for four days. This treaty\nhappened in September, the beginning of September.\nAnd the trip took six days. The normal routine was that the ship stayed overnight, got cleaned,\nand took passengers the next day. So it always left on the same day. It made up three of the four days\nand finally it left with us a day late in order to get back to its regular schedule. Therefore, we knew\nnothing about this until we got to the ship and didn't find out about Munich until we were onboard and\nspoke to some Americans.\nCan't imagine total censorship but they had complete control of everything.\n>> Bill Benson: So you're finally -- the ship finally leaves and you make it to the United States. Tell us\nabout arriving here, reuniting with your father, and then what happened.\n>> Frank Liebermann: My father picked us up. We stayed two days in New York. | got a sightseeing\ntour on the upper deck, the open deck, on a 5th Avenue bus which went all the way up 5th Avenue into\nWashington Heights and back. | got introduced to Coke.\n>> [Laughter]\n>> Frank Liebermann: | thought it was cocoa. And | really didn't want it. [Laughter]\nAnd then we took the Empire State Express and went to Cleveland where my father had\nrented a one-bedroom apartment. | had the privilege of sleeping on a mercy bed, which is a bed which\nfolds into a closet in the living room. We started a new life.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n6\n>> Bill Benson: Frank, your mother was able to bring some possessions. And one of the possessions\nthat you brought, like the sewing machine, one was a bicycle.\n>> Frank Liebermann: That didn't come up until later.\n>> Bill Benson: Until later. Ok. | want to make sure we talk about that.\n>> Frank Liebermann: In other words, one of the treats | remember is on Thursday there was a local\ndelicatessen on the bottom of the apartment house which had a 25-cent special of a corned beef\nsandwich. And on Thursday we got a corned beef sandwich, a loaf of bread, and that was the family\ndinner.\n| started elementary school. At that time we didn't have TASSEL teachers but | had a very\nnice Miss Emmanuel who stayed with me a little bit after class to help me catch up.\n>> Bill Benson: You started -- they put you back a grade.\n>> Frank Liebermann: Yeah. They put me in 3B. But when | got to Dayton, that was three months later,\n| got back into 4B so that | was --\n>> Bill Benson: And then skipped ahead if | remember right.\n>> Frank Liebermann: | was caught up.\n>> Bill Benson: Frank, November 9, 10, 1938, you're home. Your parents are at the movies and you're\nhome while they're at the movies.\n>> Frank Liebermann: Yeah. This was probably -- this was when | was here for three weeks, a little bit\nless. My parents decided they wanted to go to a movie. | think it was a Wednesday night special of 10\ncents for a movie. They asked a neighbor to look in on me. | didn't want a babysitter but she peeked in\nabout every 15 minutes.\n>> [Laughter]\n>> Frank Liebermann: All of a sudden around 9:00, the phone rang and it was a person-to-person\nphone call from my grandparents. | Knew enough that it was the middle of the night for them, 3:00 in the\nmorning. Now, person-to-person calls were for a specific person because phones -- phone calls were\nvery expensive and you didn't want to miss anybody so it was about twice as much to call\nperson-to-person. This was probably the longest hour of my life because | knew something was wrong\nand | didn't know what it was.\nWhen my parents came home, probably about 10:00, it was my grandparents that the\nbusiness had been confiscated, that my mother's two twin brothers had been jailed, and that this was\nKristallnacht. The synagogue at the time had been burned and they were desperate what can be done.\nMy father took the next bus to New York to try to see Charlie, a person who gave the affidavit, who said\nhe can't take any more responsibility even though we never took a penny from him. But apparently that\nwas too close to the person whom his father had stolen from.\nWe were in no position to make a guarantee and they tried desperately from that time on to try\nto find some ways of getting out. Mainly for the children. My grandfather, who had since been\nwidowed -- my grandmother died of natural causes -- was at an old age residence, assisted living. And\nthe other grandparents also, they just wanted to save their children.\nWe finally did manage to get passage to Shanghai. There were two countries which willingly\ntook refugees. One was the Japanese-occupied Shanghai and the Dominican Republic, in the\nCaribbean. Otherwise the world was pretty much closed.\nThey got tickets for Shanghai to leave June 1940. In the meantime World War II had started.\nThis was just after the invasion, the breakthrough of the marginal line in France. Their ticket was on an\nItalian boat. After the Germans broke through and got to Paris, the Italians declared war on England\nand France. The Suez Canal was closed and the boat went back. That was the last word we got from\nmy mother's brothers, one of the wives, and 3-year-old cousin.\n>> Bill Benson: Maybe a grandparent, | can't remember, also was about to leave but | think --\n>> Frank Liebermann: He got sick on a train. At least this is what we heard.\n>> Bill Benson: Right.\n>> Frank Liebermann: He had a ticket to get out through Spain but being sick he was transferred to\nTheresienstadt where he died in 1940. We got this eventually through my grandparents who did write\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n7\noccasionally, very heavily censored, letters, for instance. | remember one letter which was on file, from\nTheresienstadt, through the Red Cross, saying that we're doing fine, we've gained some weight. My\ngrandfather now weighs 130 pounds. He used to weigh 180. So everything that could be said was\ncoded.\nWe finally found after World War II through from a rabbi who married my grandparents, Leo\nBeck. The Nazis somehow kept him alive in Theresienstadt, probably to keep a certain amount of\norder. My mother met him in Cincinnati at the Hebrew Union College, | think in 1946, and he confirmed\nthat my grandparents were deported in 1943. And we got further indications that all the brothers died in\nAuschwitz.\nI'd like to say, I'm here as a witness. | am not a survivor. | had all the privileges of growing up\nhere but | need to pass on what can happen to humanity.\n>> Bill Benson: In the time we have remaining, there's several more things I'd like you to share with us.\nYour father was -- once he was able to get his license, you moved to Dayton and he wanted to start a\nmedical practice. Tell us what happened to him in Dayton, initially.\n>> Frank Liebermann: First of all, his fraternity brother, the gynecologist who persuaded him to come\nto Ohio, had shared an office with an ear, nose, throat physician. And he said it would really be a good\nidea for you to settle in Dayton, not in Cleveland. In order to save embarrassment and the fact that\nDayton was growing, it was probably a very good choice. He opened his practice. We moved to\nDayton.\nIn the beginning of February, he opened his practice on Valentine's Day, and immediately\nasked for admittance to the medical society, which at that time was kind of a license to legitimacy, was\nexpected for hospital privileges, etc. Shortly after he put in his application, the medical society in\nDayton had an emergency meeting on a Friday night, which, by the way, is the first day of Shabbat, the\nevening of Shabbat. It was decided to require citizenship in order to qualify for membership in the\nmedical society. And that was to take effect immediately.\n>> Bill Benson: They voted on it that Friday night.\n>> Frank Liebermann: Yes. Apparently there was some people who were quite upset with this.\nBy the way, the vote was 52-50. The next morning, a staff member of \"The Dayton Herald,\"\ncalled my father's office and said, \u201cDoctor, do you have time for me for about 15 minutes?\u201d He said\nsure. This was Saturday morning. And he said, \u201cDoctor, I'd like to see your credentials. Where did you\nstudy? Where did you take your residency? Give me your background.\u201d He said, \u201cThank you very\nmuch. | wanted to make sure that | Knew as much about you as | could.\u201d\nThe next morning, the Sunday paper of \"The Dayton Herald\" had an editorial \"Freedom of\nOpportunity in the United States.\" This was -- excuse me for making me cry. The next Monday he had\n11 new patients. And we got established. And the rest of my life is pretty much history.\n>> Bill Benson: A couple more things, Frank.\n>> Frank Liebermann: Go ahead.\n>> Bill Benson: When you got to one of the items you brought with you was a bicycle from Germany.\nPlease tell us about the bicycle.\n>> Frank Liebermann: | mentioned corruption. Friends of theirs had a bicycle and motorcycle shop.\nMr. Horowitz. He said, We can put the bicycle into a box which takes less room for packing; | think it will\nmake it much easier. | said thank you very much. And when we got to Dayton, we unpacked the lift. We\nlived in a two-bedroom apartment. We unpacked some of the furniture and the bicycle. And shortly after\nthat we got a letter saying, please be very careful when you unpack the bicycle. In the frame -- please\ntake the bicycle apart. Take the seat off and go down in the frame. We had some gold pieces. Please\nkeep those for us. They are quite valuable.\nAnd | have to give you background. Having gold coins was prohibited with a capital offense.\nMy father was furious that they would endanger me and my mother for the sake of a few hundred\ndollars. We got those gold pieces. My father had five of them made, one for my mother, one for each of\nmy kids. | think there was one extra. And they became little necklaces. Rather than selling them, | think\nthey finally wanted a refrigerator. He sent them a refrigerator and never wanted to hear from them\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n8\nagain. But People are desperate, they will do things. | always think of about a year ago, James Comey\naddressed an audience here.\n>> Bill Benson: The head of the FBI?\n>> Frank Liebermann: Yes. Who said that every FBI agent, every potential FBI agent, should have to\ncome to this museum to see the abuse of power -- what the abuse of power can do. He redefined the\nword humanity for me and for all of us: that humanity shows our good side in what we can do as human\nbeings but it also has a very dark side which we have to control. This is why | volunteer here.\n>> Bill Benson: Frank, we have time | think for a few quick questions from our audience. Can we do\nthat? Take a couple of quick questions?\n>> Frank Liebermann: Sure.\n>> Bill Benson: Before we close the program. We have a little more to go. Let's see if we have any\nquestions from our audience.\nWe have microphones coming down the aisle. Try to make your question as brief as you can.\nI'll repeat it to make sure everybody hears it and then Frank will respond to it.\n>> Mr. Liebermann, thank you for sharing your story. I'm curious how your parents spoke to you about\nwhat was going on in Germany and the world during the time you were grow up there and then\nultimately why you were coming to the states.\n>> Bill Benson: How did your parents speak to about what was going on and the decision to come to\nthe United States? What did they say to you?\n>> Frank Liebermann: A very good question, by the way. [Laughter]\n| Knew what was going on. We heard the news. We didn't want to believe what was happening\nlike most people didn't want to believe what was happening. | don't Know how -- nobody really could\nfathom how corrupt the world became during this time. It just -- it wasn't feasible.\nIn other words, civilization was at risk. | can never remember any time like this whether it was\nfrom the Japanese side, the German side. | don't know how to describe it. Unless you live through that,\nit's an era that | certainly would never, ever want to happen in any kind of way. And it's scary to think\nthat so many people are acting in an uncivilized manner.\n>> Bill Benson: Thank you.\nWe have another question. We have a young man right here, almost in the middle right there.\nLet the microphone come down to you. There you go.\n>> Did you hear any of Hitler's soeeches or hear anything on the radio?\n>> Bill Benson: Did you hear any of Hitler's speeches or anything on the radio?\n>> Frank Liebermann: You couldn't help hearing it. That's all you got. The enthusiasm is very difficult\nto even think about because a dictator can only be effective if he has support.\n>> Bill Benson: Thank you.\nWe'll do one more question and then we're going to close up. OK.\n>> Mr. Liebermann, how were you treated as a child here, as a German immigrant? | had friends that |\ntaught with, Frank Miomoto, Japanese, he was sent to a concentration camp here in the United States.\nHow were you treated?\n>> Bill Benson: How were you treated when you came to the United States as a child, an immigrant\nfrom Germany?\n>> Frank Liebermann: | was treated very well. | never realized | had an accent.\n>> [Laughter]\n>> Frank Liebermann: In other words, | became Americanized and | became an American and a patriot\nfrom the day | stepped foot in New York. | lived the American dream. And | have my family to prove it. |\nhave two daughters here, a son in Seattle, five grandchildren with whom I've traveled throughout the\nworld and | wish the same for everybody.\n>> Bill Benson: We had a couple of other hands up.\nIt's our tradition at First Person that our First Person gets the last word. I'm going to turn back\nto Frank in a moment to close the program. When he finishes, we invite anybody that wants to come up\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n9\non the stage afterwards, ask another question of Frank, just say hi, get your picture taken with him. So\nplease know that you are very welcome to do that when we finish the program.\n| want to thank all of you. We'll have four more programs, two more weeks, this week before\nwe close up for 2016. Our website will have information about our 2017 program. So please come back\nnext year, even this year if you can do so. We'd love to have you.\nFrank, I'm going to turn to you for your last word but I'm going to interject one other note that\nwe didn't get to talk about. You described to us your father on Kristallnacht, after getting the phone call\nfrom your grandparents, going to try to see what he could do with the other family relative that was here\nin the United States. Your father went on to help bring out of Europe a lot of people and he was\nrecognized for that later. Wasn't he?\n>> Frank Liebermann: My father gave out | think 107 affidavits for various refugees after World War Il.\n>> Bill Benson: And that meant he took personal responsibility for them.\n>> Frank Liebermann: Correct. He was also head of the Jewish family service in Dayton, as a\nvolunteer, not professionally. In fact, he was the recipient together with five people including President\nTruman of the 75th Anniversary HIAS Award for the settlement efforts. In other words, he did for others\nwhat he couldn't do for his own family.\nIt's important to lift everybody that we can. This is one of the issues now. And | feel strongly\nabout it. The better everybody lives, the better and safer we all are.\n>> Bill Benson: Thank you.\n>> [Applause]\n",
