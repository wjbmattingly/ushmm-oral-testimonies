And uh but we never, you know, we never got into any real, real trouble, you know, uh per se. and, of course, I continued to um, not to get ahead of my story, I quit school when I was sixteen. See back there, you know, the kids when they reached the age of sixteen, they wanted to quit school and, and go to work in the factory. There was a couple of factories. There was a box factory and there was a glass factory. Well I quit when I was sixteen, but I couldn\u2019t get a job because they discriminated against blacks in the, in the, in those industries. So I, I, I sat around for a while. I guess about a year. And I decided well I better go on back to school. So I went back to school, starting in, in my freshman year. And then I tried to join the Navy. Well the Navy had a quota for, for, for blacks. And the quota was filled. And, of course I wasn\u2019t interested in the Army at that particular time because I had a couple brother-in-laws who, who was, who had gone into the Army and, of course, they\u2019d told me some stories that was, wasn\u2019t too pleasant. So I didn\u2019t have any interest in the Army. So I continued on, continued on in school. I completed my freshman year and my sophomore year, and then I went into the city school, cause my freshman and sophomore year, they didn\u2019t have any athletics in the school at all, which I could participate in. So I went into the city school in my junior year, and I went out for football. Well I stayed out for football up until a week before the first game, and my mother made me quit because I was getting home too late to after pract uh football practice to take care of my chores around the house. So the, the line coach of the football was, was a track coach of the school and he noticed that I, I had uh quite a bit of speed when he had us running wind sprints up and down the field in our football uniform. So he asked me to come out for track. So that\u2019s how I got started in track. And, of course, I, I started progressing quite well in, in uh my track activities and he told me don\u2019t, don\u2019t go back, go out for football anymore, because he was afraid I might get hurt. So that\u2019s how I started my track career."

He was a wonderful man and he was a wonderful coach. And he taught me a number of things that I did, that I wasn\u2019t taught at home, you know, about how to conduct myself. Of course I was doing a little smoking at the time. He told me to give that up, which I did. And he said if I, if I continued doing well in my track activities I had a chance to go to college. Well that was just unheard of in my family of going to college, you see. Because no, no, no member of my family finished high school. So I dropped all my little habits that I had that was, that would, would be detrimental to me achieving my goal or my goals. And I ended up getting a scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh after I was graduated in 1935."

And that was the only way that I could go to college was through athletics. My parents didn\u2019t have the money to send me to school. I fact I didn\u2019t even have 3 4 when I, when I received the scholarship at the University of Pittsburgh. I didn\u2019t even have transportation to get to school. And the sheriff of my home town had his chauffeur to drive me to school. That\u2019s how I got to school in the, in the fall of \u00b035. And money, I had exactly twenty-five cents in my pockets when I entered the University of Pittsburgh. That\u2019s all the money I had. Cause as I said earlier I came from a poor family."

And of course when I went to Pitt I was able to beat all the athletes, all the athletes that was on the track team on my that ran in my race at Pitt in my freshman year. I came along very, very fast. My junior year in, in high school, of course my races were quite slow, but they showed progress. But then my senior year, I, I just bloomed. I just came into my own. Uh I, my uh main event was the mile. That was, that was the one the event that my coach had me concentrate on see. Well the first mile that I ran in high school, my junior year in high school was four minutes and forty-four seconds. In my senior year I ran four twenty-three four. I came along that fast. And of course when I ran that race I, I ran the second fastest school boy, school boy mile in the country, four twenty-three four. Al, Al Zamperine who was on the Olympic team with me, he ran four twenty-one something. But when I won my race in my round, my mile, when I won my mile race, I won it about a hundred and twenty yards ahead of the man who was uh ran second to me.

But my coach asked me to try out for the Olympic team. Course I had no idea that he wanted me to do that, you see. So I said okay, we\u2019ll try out for it. So I tried out for it. I qualified in the preliminaries which they ran at the University of Pittsburgh. I qualified in the semi-finals which they ran at Harvard Stadium winning the event in the, in the, in the half a mile. And then at Randall\u2019s Island where they ran the finals, I, I, I won my event there and I went to Berlin, Germany, and won my event."

I, when I came back from the Olympic games, the professor of my English Department didn\u2019t want to let, didn\u2019t want to let me enter it, enter the program cause I was a month late. However, I think the chancellor must have interceded and made it, made arrangements for me to get into the, get into the English program. And, of course, another thing that hurt me quite badly when I was grad, when I was being graduated from the University. They had what was known as the U, the University of Pittsburgh Hall of Fame. Well, I was the only athlete to bring the school international recognition, but they did not, they did not uh select me for the Hall of Fame."

Because now they had, they had all American football players that brought the school national prestige, national recognition. I brought the school international recognition. They made the Hall of Fame, but I didn\u2019t. They were white and, of course, I, I was black. So what, the only, only, I can only assume it was because of race."

In fact the athletes participated with me even after we left the University, we, we were very, very close.

And that\u2019s what the Olympics does, you know. You be, you become very, you become acquainted with a lot of people in particularly people on your team and, and you become very close with, to them. And you don\u2019t think in terms of race when you\u2019re dealing with them see. And they don\u2019t think in terms of race uh with you. I know, I know in 1950 uh I went to Georgia, to Athens, Georgia, and I made contact with uh an athlete that won, that won, that won the uh high hurdles on the 1936 Olympic team. Uh Speck Towns. Well now he was, he was a, he was a coach at the University of Georgia. And of course back in that time you know the South was running rampant with, with uh racism and discrimination. So I\u2019m when I got into Athens, I call him up. And he took and he told me, asked me where I was, where I was stopping. And I told him. He said no you stay right there and I\u2019Il come down and get you and bring you out to the school. And that\u2019s what he did. That was in 1950, 19 when, when the racism and discrimination was running rampant in (words missing in original transcript).

Uh we heard a lot about what Hitler, what Hitler was doing as 6 7 far as the, the Jewish people were concerned. And you know just before the Olympics, you know he\u2019s written a book Mein Kampf. I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t read it. Uh the book that I did read was the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. I read, I read that some years later. But when we went, cause when we went to the Olympics, we weren\u2019t interested, we weren\u2019t interested in politics. We were only interested in going to Germany, participating in our events, and trying to win as many gold medals or medal as we could win, see, and come home. That was the, that was our interest. Cause see I was, I made the team when I was twenty. Uh and before I got to Berlin, Germany, I, I had a birthday and I was twenty-one when I actually won my gold medal. So we were young.

And we were asking him, we were asking this young athlete, he spoke English fluently. And we asked him uh what did the peep, what did the German people think of Hitler. Well they thought he was, they thought he was a great man. First of all his reason for making that statement was the fact that the economic situation had improved tremendously under his regime, you see. Because what he did, he withdrew from the League of Nations, as you know, started building up all this war armament, opened up all these factories to build all these weapons, and it made it possible for a lot of Germans people to go to work. And that\u2019s why they thought that he, he was, he was great for the country. But they didn\u2019t realize that they had a Frankenstein on their hands, you see.

And, of course, they had wonderful facilities for us while we traveled by boat. It took us eight days before we landed in Hamburg, Germany. Now some of us were pretty good sailors and some of us weren\u2019t. Because with many, quite a, quite a, quite a number of the athletes got sick, seasick, cause the sea was pretty rough. But fortunately for me I was a pretty good sailor. I didn\u2019t get sick. So I was able to make the trip and enjoy the food. Because once you get seasick you don\u2019t want no parts of food.

Uh Helen Stevens who won the hundred meters for the women, the America for the, she was on the women\u2019s team. She and her coach were invited up that one particular time.

That was the four by one hundred relay team. When we, I don\u2019t know, none of us knew who made the decision as to keep those fellows off that team. Jesse Owens wanted to give up his position on the team. And I\u2019m sure that Ralph Metcalfe probably would have given his position up, to give Sam Stoller and Marty Glickman a chance to run, but the coaches of the American team decided they wanted Jesse and, and Ralph Metcalfe to run on that team. And so they, so they didn\u2019t select Sam Stoller or Marty Glickman to run. And they still would have won the, they still would have won the race cause they were both very fine, very fine runners, very fine sprinters. But who made the, who made the final decision? Whether it was Lawrence Robertson, whether Hitler had something, something to say about it, we don\u2019t know.

The events were run off with precision, the athletes didn\u2019t have to wait around when their event was called, the starter started, started your event.

When the race was, when the race was started I got right out in front and I stayed out there and won the race on, on both of those two races. On the final race, I decided well I\u2019m going to try to exercise a little strategy to make sure that I would win the race uh by laying back in second position, and then, of course, in the waiting until I hit the last three hundred meters and then starting my kick to try to win the race. But the fellow, Phil Edwards, from Canada, he set a very, very slow pace. And, of course, he set that pace and, and we, we ran that way for four hundred meters, that\u2019s half the race. When we hit the first turn of the last, the last half of the race or the last four hundred meters, the contestants or my opponents crowded right around me. I got boxed in. And the only way I could get out of that box was to stop. Now if I attempted to breakthrough, I would have fouled somebody and I\u2019d have been disqualified. But I had enough sense to know that I couldn\u2019t do that. So I stopped. So I let the, let, let my opponents proceed in front, ahead of me. I ran out into the third lane and I then I ran around the field and won the race. In fact I ran more than eight hundred meters when I won that race because I was running way out in the third lane see. But I won it. That was the most important thing. And of course the old timers just said they never in the history of the, of the, of the Olympics had ever seen a race won the way I ran mine. And you see, first of all, whenever you uh stop and you break your stride, you break your rhythm, that u, that usually finishes you. But I was able to pick up even though I started the race twice and, and, and still won."

I brought it back and then I had to send it to the Department of Agriculture here in Washington cause they had to check the dirt around it for any kind of bugs that was being brought in. So when they, when it was sent back to Connellsville, my home town, the tree was almost dead. So I turned the tree over to the Botany teacher of my high school and he worked with the tree and brought it back, and they planted it on the library at, at, at the Carnegie Library in the home town. And then of course, they, they replanted 1t when they built the stadium, the Falcon Stadium is the name of it. And that tree is now six feet tall. And a lot of the 17 18 acorns from that tree is being planted around different places around the United States, from, from my tree."

Economically speaking, blacks are getting better jobs than they got back in those days. They\u2019re able to go to any, any, any, any university in the country. Cause back in those days you couldn\u2019t go, you couldn\u2019t go, you couldn\u2019t go to University of Georgia or University of Mississippi and what you have back in those, back in those times. You couldn\u2019t go to the Naval Academy back in those times. Well, get to tell you a little experience in that, in that regard. We had a track meet to run at Annapolis, at the Naval Academy. Now here I am an Olympic champion and they told my coach that I couldn\u2019t run. I couldn\u2019t 18 19 come. So I had to stay home because of discrimination.

Now, of course, Jesse Owens came home ahead of us because he, he didn\u2019t, he didn\u2019t do any running after the Olympics outside of Dresden, Germany. One week after the Olympic games, Jesse ran in Dresden, Germany, and of course he was defeated by Ralph Metcalfe who took second to him in the Olympic games in Berlin. But he had some offers that was made, some professional offers, and of course he came back on the, on the, on the, on the Queen Mary to take advantage of those offers cause Jesse came from a poor family too. Most of the blacks came from poor families you see. None of, none of us came from any wealthy homes, or middle class homes. Most all from poor families. But many of those offers didn\u2019t pan out for him at all. And of course they, due to the fact, you see he was scheduled to run in, in, In various countries. He didn\u2019t run so they declared him, they declared him as a professional. So Jesse, his amateur days were over with after that see. But I ran after the Olympic games. I ran in White City Stadium in London. Then from there I ran up in Oslo, Norway, before coming home. But we all, we all ended up in, in New York and they had a big ticker tape parade for us in, in uh Manhattan up, up Fifth Avenue. And there was a lot of cheering and if course Mayor LaGuardia who was the Mayor of the city at the time uh gave us, gave us a, a medal uh from the City of New York. And then from there we all departed New York City and we went to our various homes. And, of course, when I got back to Connellsville, Pennsylvania, they had a big parade for me in my, in my home town.

I had three years to go to get my degree. And when I was graduated. Right after I was graduated from the University of Pittsburgh, then I went to New York University and uh while I was in graduate school, I got a job at John Wannamaker\u2019s running the elevator. And of course you know there was quite a lot of publicity came out about an Olympic champion getting a job running an elevator. And the only thing that John Wannamaker wanted to do was give me a permanent job running an elevator. That was all. Then I got a job as a social investigator for the city of New York, working with disadvantaged people who were on welfare. Then I, then I got a job working, working for the uh police Athletic League, director of one of their centers up in, up in Harlem, New York, working with disadvantaged kids. And while I was working in that job, I took examination for State Parole Officer for the State of New York and I became a parole officer, supervising parolees who were released from the New York State Reformatory, reformatories or state prisons. Then from that I worked for a short period of time with Shefland and Company uh advertising alcoholic beverages. I didn\u2019t particularly care for that cause I couldn\u2019t see myself making, making a permanent job pushing booze. So I got out of that. Then I got a job as special inves, uh, uh insurance agent for the Prudential Insurance Company. I worked a while in that job. Then I ended up my career with the Job Corps Program. You know about the Job Corps program. Again working with disadvantaged kids. I never made a lot of money, but I made a living.

He came back. He ran against race horses. You may have heard of, heard of him running against race horse. He did a number of things in order to track, try to make a living for his family.

            "answer": "Well, I would think it was pretty much the latter, pretty much the latter. Cause we\u2019d had some background on what was going on prior to the games, and of course it was brought out more pointedly after the games. See when after the games were over then Hitler continued with his program, you see. Marching on Czechoslovakia and starting, starting the war. And of course it was something that uh we more or less expected. We more or less expected. You know uh the world didn\u2019t think Hitler was doing what he was doing. You see they should have known what he was doing. You know, Germany was part of the League of Nations, like all the nations were, were part of that League. And the, the reason that they set that league up as you know from history was to more or less keep a tab on each nation in terms of them building up war armaments to start a war. Now Hitler withdrew from the League of Nations. They should have known then what he was going to do. But they didn\u2019t believe him. They didn\u2019t believe him. They didn\u2019t believe what he had printed in that book, Mein Kampf. Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of England, called him the little Corporal. They down played Hitler. They didn\u2019t believe, believe what he was about to do. So therefore they, they didn\u2019t put a curb on him see. They probably could have stopped World War II if they had done so at that time. When he withdrew from the League of Nations, if they\u2019d of put a clamp, put a clamp on him at that 23 24 particular time, there probably would have been no World War hh.

            "answer": "That was the only one. I remember this young man that came in. He was young like we were and uh he came and visited with us, you see. And of course when we heard all this uh this information about Hitler and naturally we posed a question. What did they think, what did the German people think of Hitler. And he said they, he said they thought he was a, a very good man because of what he\u2019d done for the country economically speaking, made it possible for all of them to work and of course you know all of them were working in the, in the, in these 24 25 factories where they were making weapons. And that\u2019s why they felt, cause right after World War I, you know, the Germans they really were beat down. They were, they were in a bad way. And I guess they, they were, they were, they were looking, they were looking for a savior. And that\u2019s when Hitler came into, came into play. They were looking for somebody to pull them out of those doldrums that they were in, you see. And of course when he withdrew from the League of Nations, started building all, all this, all this war armament, putting all these German people to work, he was a great guy as far as they were concerned. But they didn\u2019t know, they didn\u2019t know the whole story."

Stronger, much stronger than a fraternity because of what we go through in training and what have you, the pain, feeling of pain when we\u2019re training, the feeling of pain when we, when we race. That, that, that gives us a lot of strength and a lot of. It\u2019s something that we have in common with each other. And something that we understand. You see one athlete understands another athlete and what he has to go through. If he\u2019s a football player, a football player understands what another football player has to go through.
