See back there, you know, the kids when they reached the age of sixteen, they wanted to quit school and, and go to work in the factory. There was a couple of factories. There was a box factory and there was a glass factory. Well I quit when I was sixteen, but I couldn\u2019t get a job because they discriminated against blacks in the, in the, in those industries. So I, I, I sat around for a while. I guess about a year. And I decided well I better go on back to school. So I went back to school, starting in, in my freshman year. And then I tried to join the Navy. Well the Navy had a quota for, for, for blacks. And the quota was filled. And, of course I wasn\u2019t interested in the Army at that particular time because I had a couple brother-in-laws who, who was, who had gone into the Army and, of course, they\u2019d told me some stories that was, wasn\u2019t too pleasant. So I didn\u2019t have any interest in the Army. So I continued on, continued on in school. I completed my freshman year and my sophomore year, and then I went into the city school, cause my freshman and sophomore year, they didn\u2019t have any athletics in the school at all, which I could participate in. So I went into the city school in my junior year, and I went out for football. Well I stayed out for football up until a week before the first game, and my mother made me quit because I was getting home too late to after pract uh football practice to take care of my chores around the house. So the, the line coach of the football was, was a track coach of the school and he noticed that I, I had uh quite a bit of speed when he had us running wind sprints up and down the field in our football uniform. So he asked me to come out for track. So that\u2019s how I got started in track. And, of course, I, I started progressing quite well in, in uh my track activities and he told me don\u2019t, don\u2019t go back, go out for football anymore, because he was afraid I might get hurt. So that\u2019s how I started my track career."

Well that was just unheard of in my family of going to college, you see. Because no, no, no member of my family finished high school. So I dropped all my little habits that I had that was, that would, would be detrimental to me achieving my goal or my goals.

Well the first mile that I ran in high school, my junior year in high school was four minutes and forty-four seconds. In my senior year I ran four twenty-three four. I came along that fast. And of course when I ran that race I, I ran the second fastest school boy, school boy mile in the country, four twenty-three four. Al, Al Zamperine who was on the Olympic team with me, he ran four twenty-one something.

I know, I know in 1950 uh I went to Georgia, to Athens, Georgia, and I made contact with uh an athlete that won, that won, that won the uh high hurdles on the 1936 Olympic team. Uh Speck Towns. Well now he was, he was a, he was a coach at the University of Georgia. And of course back in that time you know the South was running rampant with, with uh racism and discrimination.

Now some of us were pretty good sailors and some of us weren\u2019t. Because with many, quite a, quite a, quite a number of the athletes got sick, seasick, cause the sea was pretty rough.

Uh Helen Stevens who won the hundred meters for the women, the America for the, she was on the women\u2019s team. She and her coach were invited up that one particular time.

Jesse Owens wanted to give up his position on the team. And I\u2019m sure that Ralph Metcalfe probably would have given his position up, to give Sam Stoller and Marty Glickman a chance to run, but the coaches of the American team decided they wanted Jesse and, and Ralph Metcalfe to run on that team. And so they, so they didn\u2019t select Sam Stoller or Marty Glickman to run. And they still would have won the, they still would have won the race cause they were both very fine, very fine runners, very fine sprinters. But who made the, who made the final decision? Whether it was Lawrence Robertson, whether Hitler had something, something to say about it, we don\u2019t know. We discussed it many, many times, but we never did know who made that decision to keep those two fellows from running on that team.

That was the type of fanfare that you saw during the games."

When the race was, when the race was started I got right out in front and I stayed out there and won the race on, on both of those two races. On the final race, I decided well I\u2019m going to try to exercise a little strategy to make sure that I would win the race uh by laying back in second position, and then, of course, in the waiting until I hit the last three hundred meters and then starting my kick to try to win the race. But the fellow, Phil Edwards, from Canada, he set a very, very slow pace. And, of course, he set that pace and, and we, we ran that way for four hundred meters, that\u2019s half the race. When we hit the first turn of the last, the last half of the race or the last four hundred meters, the contestants or my opponents crowded right around me. I got boxed in. And the only way I could get out of that box was to stop. Now if I attempted to breakthrough, I would have fouled somebody and I\u2019d have been disqualified. But I had enough sense to know that I couldn\u2019t do that. So I stopped. So I let the, let, let my opponents proceed in front, ahead of me. I ran out into the third lane and I then I ran around the field and won the race. In fact I ran more than eight hundred meters when I won that race because I was running way out in the third lane see. But I won it. That was the most important thing. And of course the old timers just said they never in the history of the, of the, of the Olympics had ever seen a race won the way I ran mine. And you see, first of all, whenever you uh stop and you break your stride, you break your rhythm, that u, that usually finishes you. But I was able to pick up even though I started the race twice and, and, and still won."

And somewhere, somewhere, somewhere later they presented an oak, a little oak tree, which I brought back home and that oak tree it was about 18, about 18 inches uh in height. I brought it back and then I had to send it to the Department of Agriculture here in Washington cause they had to check the dirt around it for any kind of bugs that was being brought in. So when they, when it was sent back to Connellsville, my home town, the tree was almost dead. So I turned the tree over to the Botany teacher of my high school and he worked with the tree and brought it back, and they planted it on the library at, at, at the Carnegie Library in the home town.

One week after the Olympic games, Jesse ran in Dresden, Germany, and of course he was defeated by Ralph Metcalfe who took second to him in the Olympic games in Berlin. But he had some offers that was made, some professional offers, and of course he came back on the, on the, on the, on the Queen Mary to take advantage of those offers cause Jesse came from a poor family too. Most of the blacks came from poor families you see. None of, none of us came from any wealthy homes, or middle class homes. Most all from poor families. But many of those offers didn\u2019t pan out for him at all. And of course they, due to the fact, you see he was scheduled to run in, in, In various countries. He didn\u2019t run so they declared him, they declared him as a professional. So Jesse, his amateur days were over with after that see. But I ran after the Olympic games. I ran in White City Stadium in London. Then from there I ran up in Oslo, Norway, before coming home. But we all, we all ended up in, in New York and they had a big ticker tape parade for us in, in uh Manhattan up, up Fifth Avenue. And there was a lot of cheering and if course Mayor LaGuardia who was the Mayor of the city at the time uh gave us, gave us a, a medal uh from the City of New York. And then from there we all departed New York City and we went to our various homes. And, of course, when I got back to Connellsville, Pennsylvania, they had a big parade for me in my, in my home town.

I had three years to go to get my degree. And when I was graduated. Right after I was graduated from the University of Pittsburgh, then I went to New York University and uh while I was in graduate school, I got a job at John Wannamaker\u2019s running the elevator.

And the only thing that John Wannamaker wanted to do was give me a permanent job running an elevator. That was all. Then I got a job as a social investigator for the city of New York, working with disadvantaged people who were on welfare. Then I, then I got a job working, working for the uh police Athletic League, director of one of their centers up in, up in Harlem, New York, working with disadvantaged kids.

I didn\u2019t particularly care for that cause I couldn\u2019t see myself making, making a permanent job pushing booze. So I got out of that. Then I got a job as special inves, uh, uh insurance agent for the Prudential Insurance Company. I worked a while in that job. Then I ended up my career with the Job Corps Program. You know about the Job Corps program. Again working with disadvantaged kids. I never made a lot of money, but I made a living.

Cause we\u2019d had some background on what was going on prior to the games, and of course it was brought out more pointedly after the games. See when after the games were over then Hitler continued with his program, you see. Marching on Czechoslovakia and starting, starting the war. And of course it was something that uh we more or less expected. We more or less expected. You know uh the world didn\u2019t think Hitler was doing what he was doing. You see they should have known what he was doing. You know, Germany was part of the League of Nations, like all the nations were, were part of that League. And the, the reason that they set that league up as you know from history was to more or less keep a tab on each nation in terms of them building up war armaments to start a war.

They didn\u2019t believe, believe what he was about to do. So therefore they, they didn\u2019t put a curb on him see. They probably could have stopped World War II if they had done so at that time.

Uh but it would been, it would have been very hurting for the athletes who had made so much preparation, who had trained so long over the years. Fortunately for me I didn\u2019t train like that. I was more or less a gifted athlete. I came up very fast. But there was other athletes who had trained for the Olympics who had trained for years to prepare for the games, and that would have been very, very bad if they could not have gone.

And I guess they, they were, they were, they were looking, they were looking for a savior. And that\u2019s when Hitler came into, came into play. They were looking for somebody to pull them out of those doldrums that they were in, you see. And of course when he withdrew from the League of Nations, started building all, all this, all this war armament, putting all these German people to work, he was a great guy as far as they were concerned.

That, that, that gives us a lot of strength and a lot of. It\u2019s something that we have in common with each other. And something that we understand.
