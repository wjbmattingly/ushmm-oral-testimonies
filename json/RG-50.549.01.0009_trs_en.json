    "header": "Nesse Godin 3 December 14, 1995 Page 3 run to the village.\ufb02 The village was, was within sight. We could see maybe one mile away. We women start say, \ufb01How can we run? We cannot even walk.\ufb02 Somebody else said, \ufb01The guards may be hiding behind the barn. They just wait for us to start running and they\u2122ll have an excuse to shoot us.\ufb02 So all day long we sat in that barn, not knowing that the guards had run away. They escaped. You see we did not know whether the war was ending, where the positions of the armies were. We didn\u2122t even know that there were Allied forces. We didn\u2122t know a thing. In the evening, it was dark already, I remember it well, we heard footsteps of boots. Now up to this day when I hear boots marching, even on the beautiful parade, I get nervous because footsteps of boots reminded us of SS and Gestapo and selections so there we heard these footsteps and we said, \ufb01Oh, the henchmen are back.\ufb02 But we heard Russian language. Russian language, Russian soldiers, dear ladies, we didn\u2122t know you were here, we were, we are fighting the war, we found already a few other camps. We cannot stay with you. We leave two, three people. Tomorrow there medics will come and help you. So all through the night we still stayed in that barn, naturally we were free. Now what happened in that barn the night of liberation? Some people applauded with their hands. They could hardly move them. Some people jumped up for joy. Some people started to talk where they will go, what will they do. I personally cried. I cried so hard and it is now 50 Nesse Godin 4 December 14, 1995 Page 4 years after liberation. And for 50 years, I\u2122m trying to analyze, why did I cry? Did I cry for my family that was dead? At that point, I didn\u2122t know if anyone was alive because in that barn I was alone. No one of my family. Did I cry for, because I didn\u2122t know what was happening? Did I cry for joy? But I came to a conclusion that I cried because I felt sorry for myself. I thought where am I going? There\u2122s no telephone to pick up and tell I\u2122m coming home. There\u2122s no home, no family and sincerely, many kind people say, \ufb01Nesse, you talk about the Holocaust and we don\u2122t see tears from you.\ufb02 I really cried that time the last time. So once in a while, I have a little tear in my eye. I learned to laugh and to love. But I never cry. So that was this night, the __________ day of liberation. The following day, when the Russians came, they explained to us that the village does not have a hospital. They have a little hotel. They are going to convert this little, it\u2122s a inn, not even a hotel. They are going to convert it into a hospital. They are going to try to take the little healthier women and bring them to the village, put \u201aem in the little homes. Some homes were already empty. The Germans had run away being afraid for the Russians. Some, in some homes there were still some Germans that stayed. I know they spoke German, it was a German area. Pomerania, mostly, Polish German, border but this little village was mostly German. They, so the Russians the next day came with little carts, whatever they could take from the villagers, a horse and buggy. I Nesse Godin 5 December 14, 1995 Page 5 personally was carried by a Russian soldier, on his arms, and he carried me to the village. I was nothing but skin and bones. And he brought me to the village, he put me in the kitchen of that little room, on a straw sack and he said that eventually somebody will come and help me and give me food. A little bit later, they brought another woman that they put next to me on the straw sack. This woman, I\u2122m really sorry that I cannot remember her name. She was a teacher in one of the religious Yovna (ph) schools and I knew her from before the war because I had friends that went to that school. And when I saw her I was so glad that she was there next to me on that straw sack. At least I felt I had someone from home. And the Russian soldiers every day came for a few days, they delivered a little bit food for us. Also, some Jewish women that were a little bit stronger started to cook a little bit, get from the villagers some food or just take it from them and started to cook a little bit. After I was there one day or two days, I really don\u2122t remember, one day, one of the women that were a little stronger walked in and just said to me, \ufb01What are you doing here with a dead person?\ufb02 I didn\u2122t realize that the woman next to me was dead. They carried her out and I wanted to really go out and go out like, see where they\u2122re burying her or whatever. But I couldn\u2122t. So I thought let me look out and see how the free world looks. Cause I hadn\u2122t seen the free world. Could hardly get up. And there was a windowpane, it was already towards evening. And I looked through Nesse Godin 6 December 14, 1995 Page 6 that windowpane to see how is freedom? What\u2122s outside? And what I saw was a monster. A reflection of a monster in that windowpane. A person, eyes sunken in, really a skeleton covered with skin. That\u2122s what I saw. Like you see children for Halloween how they have these masks and I turned around to see who was behind me and there was no one there. And this is when I realized how I looked. How I looked. I did not really imagine that I looked that way. Okay. After a few days being in that house, one, a truck or a car, a truck, I believe it was a truck that came and picked us up and took us to that makeshift hospital. What I remember of that coming to the hospital, I remember them shaving my head, shaving my private parts wherever hair is, washing me with some kind of a disinfectant because I remember a burn of a, where they shaved. And then I didn\u2122t remember anything else. Not a thing. Next thing I remember, opening my eyes and seeing a man with a white coat on and talking to me in Russian, explaining to me that he is a doctor, that I shouldn\u2122t worry, I\u2122m in a hospital and he would love to know my name. Because they did not have time to register me when I became unconscious. According to what they told me I was three days unconscious with high fever of typhus and typhoid, those two different diseases. And him telling me that the most thing that he\u2122s worried about is that my toes were frozen and he just hopes that they wouldn\u2122t have to be amputated. And as I started to tell him my age, people from down the row, it was Nesse Godin 7 December 14, 1995 Page 7 like a big ward with many beds, somebody else tells __________ \ufb01Oh, Nesa __________ that\u2122s you! We didn\u2122t know who this was. Everybody asked do you know this person?\ufb02 And there were a few people from my hometown that I knew and I really felt already more comfortable about it. So I was gettin\u2122 a little better. People started to leave from the hospital and then I was transferred to another smaller room. The main thing, the treatment was on my legs. And I don\u2122t even remember if I ever said that, if I gave this testimony or not but I really feel I should tell it now. I decided that I don\u2122t want to live. After all this that I went through, the stupidity of me, not wanting to live was, now when I think back of it, it was crazy. I heard and saw some people were united with the, right there in that hospital there was a mother and a daughter and here I was all by myself. I thought what do you need to live for? So I decided to do a hunger strike and every time they brought a little food, I just threw it out or gave it to the lady next to me. And she was, I thought of that, I\u2122m terrible but now I think of her as wonderful, she told on me. So they wouldn\u2122t walk out from the room until I finished the food. And I really recovered pretty good. My, what was at that point, I still had, you see at the very end on the death march I was beaten up severely. And I still had my face swollen. My toes had kind of, the, the, a big layer that was frozen of the skin just peeled off, like, like you see a snake change his skin? That\u2122s how this came off. And my temperature Nesse Godin 8 December 14, 1995 Page 8 went down and I gained a little bit weight so, they kept me there because I was alone for a while. And then one day they told me I have to go down to the office. The office was like a little room. And when I came down there, they said to me, \ufb01We are going to close this hospital and you can go now. We feel you\u2122re in good shape. You can go.\ufb02 And I said to them, \ufb01Where should I go?\ufb02 They said, \ufb01Well, you want to go up, where are you from?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I\u2122m from Lithuania but I don\u2122t have a home. I don\u2122t have a family, I don\u2122t have anybody. I don\u2122t know where I should go. I\u2122m 17 years old. I don\u2122t know what to do.\ufb02 So they asked the lady that was next to me where she was from and she happened to be from Lithuania and because I was just 17, I was a minor. I was assigned to her. I became her ward. We had one document that stated her name and my name, my last name and saying that she\u2122s in charge because I\u2122m a minor. And that\u2122s how we left Freenuv (ph). ",

            "question": "Do you have her name? Do you remember her name?",
            "answer": "I don\u2122t, I remember her first name, Hannah, but I don\u2122t think I ever knew her last name. I don\u2122t think I ever knew it. She was very kind. She was very nice. She was more like a sister to me than a stranger. So we left, with the idea to go to Lithuania. She had left a child for safe, safekeepi ng with a Lithuanian family. She was from Kaunas and she really thought that maybe her child is alive. She wants to go back. Now I wanted to go to Lithuania because the last thing that we said to each other Nesse Godin 9 December 14, 1995 Page 9 when we came to the concentration camp, that is my brother and my mom before we were separated, if we survive this hell, we have to make a meeting point, back home in Lithuania. So okay. So this I had back in my mind. And I thought after all, we had a home, we had a business, we left belongings with non-Jewish people for safekeeping. Maybe I\u2122ll find it. So that was my plan. So there we go. You couldn\u2122t go to the railroad station, say I want to buy a ticket to go to Lithuania. Didn\u2122t work that way. See you are very young, I don\u2122t know if you understand that. That first it, it wasn\u2122t even, the war hadn\u2122t even ended yet, so a military trucks were going east and they were going west and they were going south. Trains were going back and forth. The Russians were looting Germany and taking machinery back to Russia. So you hitchhiked. You hitchhiked on a train, on a freight train. You stood there, you told them you want to go little bit east, they took you. They said, \ufb01You want to go up to this and this little town, we\u2122ll take you.\ufb02 Then you have to wait for a next train and it took weeks until you got at least somewhere. And this is the way we arrived in the city of Lodz, Poland. When we arrived in Lodz, Poland, like through the grapevine while we were traveling people were telling us that in Lodz, Poland, there is already shelters. Christian relief, Red Cross, Jewish relief, Hiyas (ph), the Join (ph), some kind of Jewish agencies helping out refugees. All of a sudden we were called refugees. So, we were very glad to arrive in Lodz. When we came Nesse Godin 10 December 14, 1995 Page 10 there, there was a big shelter on __________ 66. I remember that address and we, when we came in there was a very big room, we signed in, we were assigned where to go to sleep and in that room on the walls, there were big billboards. Posters like, and it was divided by country and divided each country more or less by city. And you, if let\u2122s say if you were from Kaunas, Kaunas and surrounding __________ and surround Siauliai, that\u2122s in Lithuania was called and surrounding. So I saw quite a few names there and I wrote down my name. That was in case somebody of your family comes. That\u2122s how you got connected. You see when I tell it to people, they cannot understand why would you want to write your name on a posterboard but this was the way you found each other. Your name and where you are staying, whether you are continuing, whether you are in Lodz, wherev er. And that particular, that shelter was, there was a big courtyard with many houses on, see in Europe, some people don\u2122t understand that especially in the large cities, they used to have a whole courtyard maybe six, seven buildings. And you had to go in through a gate and it was closed for the night. And so we were assigned in that same courtyard, a place. Now all that night I thought to myself, why didn\u2122t I write down my name within eyesight. I wrote it down kind of low in the poster, nobody\u2122s going to bend down and look for my name. I was 17, I wasn\u2122t too bright. And I could hardly wait for the next day to go back and put my name with eye level on that thing. I said, \ufb01I\u2122ll put it Nesse Godin 11 December 14, 1995 Page 11 on again, that\u2122s alright, nobody\u2122s going to say why do you have it twice.\ufb02 And, as I was writing my name, Nesa Galperin, that was my name __________ N,E,S,A G,A,L,P,E,R,I,N. Galperin. And a woman said to me, \ufb01What Galperin, are you from Siauliai?\ufb02 She was standing right next to me. And why did she ask that way? Just if you come of European background, you can understand, they usually said, \ufb01I am Galperin, the, the doctor Galperin, the lawyer Galperin, the shoemaker.\ufb02 My parents had a dairy business, I said, \ufb01I am Galperin from the dairy business from the __________, from the dairy business.\ufb02 And the woman looked at me and she said, \ufb01No, Nesa, that\u2122s you, you look so terrible, I would never recognize you.\ufb02 And, and she said that. I thought to myself, isn\u2122t she crazy? Everybody looks terrible. And when I looked at her, I recognized the lady. She was a very nice lady. But before the war, everybody called her the, the __________, the person that is not all there. She had some mental problems. And next thing out of that woman\u2122s mouth was, \ufb01Oh, I was with your mother in the camp. She\u2122s in this and this shelter in this and this village.\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01You were with my mother. My mother was taken to Galepf (ph) in Shtoodruff (ph).\ufb02 She said, \ufb01Yes but then there was another selection and they took the people in the sixties away to the left,\ufb02 and asked, she was maybe in her thirties and my mother was in the forty, she said, \ufb01They took us again and send us to labor.\ufb02 Now as young as I was, I thought can I believe a crazy woman? Nesse Godin 12 December 14, 1995 Page 12 Always people said the crazy so and so. So I didn\u2122t know but I thought, I said, \ufb01Well, maybe I should check it out.\ufb02 So I go up to the lady, to this Hannah, who is my, whose ward I am and I said to her, \ufb01We have to go back to the German border.\ufb02 She looked at me, she says, \ufb01Child you\u2122re crazy. Nobody goes back, everybody goes forward.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01But somebody told me that my mother is there, near the German border.\ufb02 She said, \ufb01I love you but how can I go with you to your mother? I want to go to my own child.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01But you have to go with me, you have the document.\ufb02 So she took the piece of paper, she tore it to pieces, she said to me, \ufb01Go over to the desk, tell them you\u2122re 18 years old. And you\u2122ll have your own document.\ufb02 So I went over to the desk. I told them I\u2122m 18 years old. I need a, a document. They gave me the document. Now everybody\u2122s traveling one way, I\u2122m traveling the other. Everybody\u2122s going east, I\u2122m going west. Some Russian soldier felt sorry for me, gave me his coat. And it was May already. I remember being on one of the trains and hearing a lot of shooting and thinking that we are being bombed but that was the celebration of VE Day and I arrived at that village. Got to the village, found the shelter, walk in there and I see women from my hometown and I recognize them, some woman that had bakery, another one that had a dry goods store, another one that had, that sold buttons and thread and all kinds of things. And I look at with my eyes and they say, \ufb01Who are you?\ufb02 And I say again, Nesse Godin 13 December 14, 1995 Page 13 \ufb01I\u2122m Galperin from the dairy business.\ufb02 \ufb01Oh, Nesa, your mom heard that you were alive and she heard that you were in Lodz and she went there to look for you.\ufb02 So you can see, this isn\u2122t just my story, how we survivors went looking for families back and forth, back and forth, hearing rumors, trying to find each other. It took me about maybe another two weeks or three weeks to get back to Lodz."

            "answer": "Oh, my, it was unbelievable. It was unbelievable. I just thought in my heart that maybe I was kind to, to some older person. When you are 17 and you think of somebody 46 or 47, it\u2122s old. I just thought maybe God helped to my prayers. Maybe God paid me back because I was kind to some older ladies in the camps. And it, you, it just undescribable, undescribable, that I felt so grateful, so grateful. And those remember asking me was their child with me. And unfortunately there wasn\u2122t. I was with some people not even from my town, just a few from my hometown were with me in my camp. And when I came to Lodz back, yeah, we human beings are really wonderful, a wonderful thing on the earth. When we came, when I came back to Lodz even out of the survivors there was a welcoming committee at the time. I came down in the three weeks that I wasn\u2122t there or four weeks, such a difference. I didn\u2122t have to ask where is the shelter. There were Nesse Godin 14 December 14, 1995 Page 14 women saying already, \ufb01Where you from? I\u2122m going to help you, there\u2122s a shelter.\ufb02 And a woman with red hair, I don\u2122t remember her name, came over, she said, \ufb01Nesa.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01How do you know me?\ufb02 She says, \ufb01Ooh, I know, you were here, you went back, I\u2122ll take you to your mother.\ufb02 And I just went with her. I figured even if she takes me to any mother, I\u2122ll just go. And I don\u2122t know how I walked up three or four floors because as I told you my feet were so raw, I could hardly walk. I shuffled my feet and there I came up and the only thing I remember of that reunion is this woman knocked on the door and said, \ufb01Frau Galperin, Mrs. Galperin, I brought you your daughter.\ufb02 And she left. She didn\u2122t even wait. And the door opened up and there wasn\u2122t any electricity, it was a candle burning, and there was my mother. She looked like my mother and she didn\u2122t run to grab me and hug me. She looked at me and I couldn\u2122t understand, why this cold reception. And she said to me, \ufb01Okay, take off your junk.\ufb02 I had, my face was wrapped because this was still swollen and a hole in there draining parts and no hair, I still had that little hair and that was wrapped with a rag. With that big . . . [end of side 1 of tape 1] My mother said to me, \ufb01Take off your, your junk, your wrappings, your __________ like was saying, just take them off.\ufb02 So as I started to unwrap, there, there, the scarf and took off the coat. And you see when I was a little child I had a tracheotomy. I had measles and I had some infection and when my mother saw this little thing here on my neck, on Nesse Godin 15 December 14, 1995 Page 15 my actually, right here in the middle of my neck, she grabbed me. She said, \ufb01My child, I didn\u2122t recognize you.\ufb02 You see she looked the same because she was 46, you don\u2122t change that much. But me as a little girl growing up and looking different and, and all this, being so skinny and so ill. Now for weeks and weeks I didn\u2122t go down those steps cause I couldn\u2122t walk them down and I always wondered how did I ever go up those steps. Now we were very fortunate to find each other. There we were, a mother and a daughter, not too many survivors at that point had already someone of their family. Some did but not too many, especially a mother. Forty-six was considered old, not too many at that age survived the Holocaust. Now we stayed in Lodz not knowing what to do."

            "question": "Because it\u2122s so moving, I imagine that what had kept you going was your, your wish to survive, to be with your mother and brother? And I imagine it kept your mother going, the hope to be there for you. And I, I just wonder, did you hold each other? Would you, would you sleep soundly holding onto each other at night?",
            "answer": "When, you see all through the Holocaust, it\u2122s true the hope helped. But to very sincere with you, there was no formula for surviving. Many times people will say to me, \ufb01Oh, Nesse, you\u2122re a strong lady, that\u2122s why you survived the Holocaust.\ufb02 I was Nesse Godin 16 December 14, 1995 Page 16 a little child. I wasn\u2122t, and somebody will say, \ufb01You must have been intelligent.\ufb02 Now how intelligent was it? I was just a kid. It, I survived maybe by the grace of God, maybe by sheer luck, maybe by the kindness of women that held my hand and did give me hope or gave them their own bite of bread. Or maybe women that took straw and wrapped my body so I would keep warm. I didn\u2122t understand that straw is a insulation. I really don\u2122t know what made me survive. I really don\u2122t know what made my mother survive. My mother always, when she died 27 years ago here in the United States, she alway, at that time people didn\u2122t take oral history. I wished they would have had her oral history. She was telling me how many times, even from the labor camp, she was selected to go back to the concentration camp to be killed. And by some miracle she was left or she was overlooked or they decided that she can still work. At one point she said to me, \ufb01They told another woman to take off the shoes and give it to her and the woman went there and she, she, she was still alive.\ufb02 So we don\u2122t know how but when we were reunited, we became really like one person. We, I didn\u2122t even want my mother to leave that room. She used to have to go down to bring up some food or get in that shelter some food or, or food stamps or whatever we, like little nut foods, there was a little ticket to go to get the food. I was always afraid that if she leaves me that I won\u2122t see her again. And from the day of liberation, no from the day of reunion with my Nesse Godin 17 December 14, 1995 Page 17 mother, \u201atil the day she died, we were not separated. She chose not, never to marry again, she lived with us, with my husband and I until the day she died. And I cherished her, everybody knows I respected her. I cherished her and the day she died, I thanked God for giving me a gift of so many years after the Holocaust to have a mother. Many people thought I was crazy at her funeral. You see now I have a tear when I think of my mom. But at her funeral, I stood there when the casket was being lowered and I said, people didn\u2122t want me to watch how they lower the casket. They said you\u2122re supposed to stay aside. I said, \ufb01No, I have to stay here because I was blessed as a survivor of the Holocaust to have a mother survive and die by a disease.\ufb02 I know where she was laid, I know I\u2122ll put the stone over her grave, I know I\u2122ll be able to come and visit her which I do very often. I go constantly for my father. I don\u2122t even know where his ashes are. So you ask me that question. We were inseparable and I was lucky that my husband Jack just adored my mother. He really was, he lost his whole family. He cannot even listen to me speak about the Holocaust. And he was very kind and glad to have her and we cherished her. Anyway, to continue what happened afterwards. So one day, my mother comes upstairs after going to look get some food or some clothing, I don\u2122t remember and she tells me that she ran into a gentleman that was with the Soviet Army by the name of Tabreeshock (ph). My father\u2122s younger sister, her Nesse Godin 18 December 14, 1995 Page 18 married name was Tabreeshock (ph). This gentleman told my mother that he stationed in Lodz and his cousin who was my uncle by marriage and my aunt, my father\u2122s sister succeeded to escape from Vilna, just as the, before the Germans marched in to the Soviet Union. That they have returned back to Vilna and they hope as Polish citizens to, they had, there was a certain law, that you were allowed to live __________, Vilner (ph), that\u2122s we Jewish people call __________, if you\u2122re a Polish citizen you were allowed to go back to Poland. And most people did not want to stay in the Soviet Union cause it was Communism and most Jewish people had the dream at that time to, to go to Israel or to come to America. So he told us that he knows that in a very short time, he doesn\u2122t know it\u2122ll take a week or two weeks or three weeks that his cousin and, and, he\u2122s, my aunt who\u2122s, he\u2122s cousin to by marriage are going to try to come to Lodz. We shouldn\u2122t go nowhere, we\u2122ll be reunited. So we were anticipating every day are they coming, are they coming? My mother went always to check if their name is on the board and finally they arrive. They arrive in Lodz, my uncle, my aunt. They had a boy that was twelve years old. My uncle\u2122s best friend, he\u2122s my, his best friend\u2122s brother and the brother\u2122s best friend, so there are three single men with my uncle and my aunt and that little boy. So we are already a family unit. Here we are surrounded with my aunt and my uncle and, and a few guys that are there and we are all looking, where should we Nesse Godin 19 December 14, 1995 Page 19 go? Where should we go. We get already messages that the men were liberated from Dachau. We hear already that the men that were taken to Shtoodruff (ph) that came with us from Siauliai were taken to Dachau and the __________ camps of Dachau. So we are waiting to hear maybe someone of the men survived. Eventually come a few gentlemen that were liberated from Dachau that are from my hometown. What they did, they decided to send out a few people to come to Poland, see if, and tell the women don\u2122t go back to the Soviet Union, don\u2122t go to Communism. Try to come to the American Zone. So and so they came with list telling who survived. On that list was my brother\u2122s name. And we knew this, one of this gentleman and he said you, to my mother, \ufb01Your son said if I find you, try every which way to come to the American Zone.\ufb02 Why was the aim to go to the American Zone? My mother had a sister that lived in Washington, D.C. And if we would be in the American Zone, we would be able to come to America. So here we are, all this group of people, not knowing what to do. So one day, my mother says to me, \ufb01You know, Nesa, we two women alone, we couldn\u2122t do all this traveling.\ufb02 We couldn\u2122t, you still had to go a little bit across the border, there was no really regulations about the border. But still you have to take a chance, you had to take a truck, you had to walk. She says, \ufb01We two women alone couldn\u2122t really manage all of this. One of us have to get married.\ufb02 And I looked at my mother and I thought she has me. Why Nesse Godin 20 December 14, 1995 Page 20 does she want to get married? But the next thing out of my mother\u2122s mouth was, \ufb01My child, I had a wonderful husband. He was killed in Auschwitz. But you, it\u2122s true you\u2122re very young. Maybe you should get married.\ufb02 So I looked at her, I said, \ufb01Where do I get a husband?\ufb02 And she said, \ufb01Look at those guys, three guys, single guys. The friend of the uncle\u2122s, his brother and his friend.\ufb02 Well I looked at the three guys and I said, \ufb01Well this one is too old. This one is too short and maybe this one.\ufb02 So my mother said, \ufb01Okay.\ufb02 Now I don\u2122t know how Jack and I got married, I really don\u2122t know. We, we just talked that it would be a good idea and I never kissed him before or anything and we went and we did a document that I\u2122m his wife. And so, we were already like a, a threesom e, a family. But I really didn\u2122t, legally, I was his wife but for all practical services we were not husband and wife until later on we had the religious wedding. So here we are, trying to find out how can we get to the American Zone. So everybody says not a big deal. There is a, the Jewish agent, he\u2122s helping out people to go across the border. Once you get into Berlin, Berlin had four zones: The Russian Zone, the French Zone, the English Zone, the American Zone. So to go to the Russian Zone was no problem because we were in the same place. And we didn\u2122t have any luggage, we didn\u2122t have anything. So we took a walk and we were in the American Zone. And when we registered there in the camp and eventually through the Jewish Agency, people came and helped you Nesse Godin 21 December 14, 1995 Page 21 to go to wherever you had family. And my brother was already at that point in a displaced person camp called Feldafing. And in October of 1945, we arrived in the displaced person camp. At that point, we had separated from the rest of the people because we were privileged to go to Feldafing because my brother was there."

He didn\u2122t look so bad because don\u2122t forget from May \u201atil October, we all, I looked already better, my hair had grown and, and we looked already entirely different. And he was married in the ghetto and his wife, who was with me in, in the labor camp, and we were separated after liberation, she was there already. She had come already there. So we found him already with his wife and it was just so wonderful. In that villa, it was called Villa Valbearta (ph), those villas were used actually for SS men, for their entertainment, it was like a country club. Feldafing had golf courses and, and all this beautiful things for the SS and the Gestapo to come and enjoy themselves and that thing was turned into the displaced person camp. For the plain (ph) soldiers, they had these Nesse Godin 23 December 14, 1995 Page 23 barracks and that\u2122s where originally the survivors were put in, in those barracks. But if the family started to come, they assigned those buildings, those villas they called it villas. So now that villa that we were in, maybe one family lived before or one SS man with his wife or a commandant or whatever. And here we were, downstairs in one room lived a woman with her, with her husband that she married right after the war two, another room, two, I\u2122m trying to think, we were like five families, five different groups, units that lived in that one house. They called it a villa. It was a house like my house. And we were assigned the kitchen. Now don\u2122t forget, I wasn\u2122t really sleeping with Jack. He, to me he wasn\u2122t, he was a husband on paper but we hadn\u2122t had a __________ a religious wedding. There I slept with my mother in one bed and then there this other bed that poor Jack had to sleep. And then they started to plan our religious wedding. And after a few months, we were married.

Especially in our tradition, you have to go around the, the groom seven times.\ufb02 And she said to me, \ufb01Would be nice if you put on a pair of shoes with heels Nesse Godin 24 December 14, 1995 Page 24 so you look a little taller.\ufb02 I don\u2122t know who gave us those, those heels but I hadn\u2122t worn heels before. And when I was walking around Jack, I couldn\u2122t stop laughing. I was laughing and laughing, laughing, and everybody said, \ufb01That stupid kid. She\u2122s gettin\u2122 married, look at her, such a stupid girl.\ufb02 So that was in Feldafing. And we lived actually in that kitchen, we just switched beds. Jack hopped into my bed, my mother got his bed. We stayed there for a year, in that kitchen, until my oldest daughter was born. She was born in March of 1947 and when we, when she was born in \u212247, some of the people had already documents to immigrate somewhere. Some people went on illegal immigration to Israel. And so we, the, the camp had already little bit more space so we were assigned in another villa, was called Villa Gowlitz (ph) a room. But still we shared that room with my mom and Jack and I and my youngest daughter, my oldest daughter. And the life in the displaced person camp, it was organized living. Some people think well you were free and you were free. I remember there was a curfew when we first came to the camp. In later years, not. But when we first came to the displaced person camp, is was a curfew. You were not allowed to go in town whenever you wanted. Yes it was no gate, it was not fenced but you were told that after, I don\u2122t remember, ten o\u2122clock or eleven or whatever, don\u2122t remember anymore, you were not allowed to walk around. Also, it was very difficult. Can you imagine us victims, I don\u2122t call us survivor, we were Nesse Godin 25 December 14, 1995 Page 25 victims that survived by miracle, walking among murderers? You see now if I would come to Germany, it\u2122s a new generation, new people. Young people that will not dare, it\u2122s a new life, a new government. But don\u2122t forget, right in 1945 and \u212246, the Nazis were there. You could see it on their faces, men that just put on, changed their coat, that\u2122s all. Their feelings they still had."

Public kitchens. One was kosher and one was not. Now when we came, because my brother knew somebody, my husband got the job in the kosher kitchen. So when you, you had the job, you were better off, you got, at that time was Nesse Godin 27 December 14, 1995 Page 27 everything rationed. You got your ration card, you went and that\u2122s when they gave you food. So at the beginning, you really had to go to that kitchen to get your food. After while, they kind of gave you the food and you could cook it in your little room or in your little kitchen, wherever. But at the beginning, you just had to go to those kitchens. Also, packages started to come from the United States, from the Red Cross or whatever, there was a, a warehouse for clothing. Like we give now for the poor and they come. I was watching the other day how the children came and when got their toys and how happy they were.

You were alone, you were not, the men started the little bit, Trades (ph) started a little bit black market business. There was something that you could do but what could women do? So most people were getting married, also, also, it was very much encouraged by the community. Let\u2122s rebuild our nation. Let\u2122s have children. For every child that died, let\u2122s have another child. And within a year, that\u2122s all you saw, is baby carriages. When I was pregnant, every woman was pregnant.

            "answer": "And, so, we were talking about the displaced person camp, how it was. Now you ask me about my brothers. Now as I told you before, I\u2122ll just briefly go through. On my other testimony and videotape, I speak a little bit maybe about it. But my father was taken with the children selection on November 5th of 1943, to Auschwitz. Somebody corrected me now and they said that nobody was killed in Auschwitz, they were killed in Beerkano (ph). But this is after the fact, people decipher it and they tell you. But when we were told, we were just told they were taken to Auschwitz. So before all the information that was available that we have now, it was just said to Auschwitz. So he was taken to Auschwitz or whatever, Beerkano (ph) where the gas chambers and the crematorias were and he was killed. My mom as I told you survived the same type of camp as I did. My older brother, Yerhuskel (ph) survived Dachau concentration camp. Now my brother who is older than me five Nesse Godin 32 December 14, 1995 Page 32 years but I always refer to him as my younger brother because there was the older. His name is Manasha (ph) Ga lperin. His experience was entirely different. When we were being deported to the concentration camp, when we were being taken to the railroad stations, all of a sudden we were there, my mom and my brother and myself and two uncles and a aunt and my brother Manasha (ph). And all of a sudden we didn\u2122t see him. And my poor mom cried, she said, \ufb01Oh, that delinquent, he must have done something and the SS men must have killed him,\ufb02 or whatever. You see when he was a young boy, he always got into trouble. I don\u2122t mean trouble like we say now, stealing or dope or whatever. He always, if he rode his bike, he held onto a truck and that\u2122s how he rode his bike. He was always daring and doing things and he had all kinds of friends and, that my mother didn\u2122t approve in the younger days. So he had a Lithuanian friend that always told him, if things get very bad, he\u2122s going to help you. Young guy. And this guy always said to him, \ufb01Manasha (ph), don\u2122t come to our house cause my parents may not approve of that.\ufb02 But my brother knew his house, he knew the, the little forest next to it, a little woods there, he say, \ufb01You know that smokehouse that we have there? You sneak in there and when I will hear that the ghetto is being deported, I\u2122m going to look and to see if you are in that smokehouse. I\u2122m going to put out food for you. But if they catch you there, don\u2122t you ever tell that I let you in.\ufb02 And this is what happen. That Nesse Godin 33 December 14, 1995 Page 33 day before we were really being taken, this young man found out that we were being deported. And my brother says that somehow, he did send word to him, that he\u2122s ready for him to come. So he just somehow snuck away. We were walking, he snuck away, they didn\u2122t see him and he was in that forest. About three weeks later, the Soviets took over this area, the outskirts of Siauliai and my brother was free. So this is how he was liberated in Lithuania. Now his story was entirely different because after a few years, 1946 or \u212247 maybe \u212247, I don\u2122t know exactly when, he was called by the NKBG. And they told him that they know that the mother and the brother and the sister were liberated from the camps. And how come we did not come back to Lithuania. We must be Zionists. And if we are Zionist, we are against Communism. So he was sent to Siberia for 15 year. Now after being there all this time, when Stalin died, some people, you know how when somebody that the government gives you amnesty? So after being nine years in Siberia in the gulags, he was given an amnesty and was let go. And because of our own involvement in the United States and the involvement of the Israeli government on behalf of Soviet Jewry, he was let go and he came to Israel. He lived there for 20 years. Then two of his children married Americans and now, as we talk, he lives in Baltimore. I have tried many a times for him to give testimony but he says he just cannot do it. He says his blood pressure goes up too high. So you see, we are two people of one Nesse Godin 34 December 14, 1995 Page 34 family. I feel that this testimony is very important, to remember the dead but most of all to teach the living what hatred and indifference can do. God bless him, he\u2122s lovely, he\u2122s great, I love him, but he wouldn\u2122t talk to anybody. Not even to me. I wanted to go with a tape recorder, take his story, he doesn\u2122t want to bring it up."

But he always says that if you share a piece of bread, sometimes it saves your life. And when I say yeah, people shared bread with me and maybe this saved my life, he said, no and he went in and told me a story what happened to him. When he was taken from Lithuania, from Siauliai, to go on the train to be taken to Siberia, his wife gave him a loaf of bread. While he was sitting on the train, there was a man, a Russian man sitting next to him. The Russian man said to him, my brother is a big man, he was always very big and he was bald at a very young age. He said that this Russian man said to him, \ufb01Dyadya (ph), uncle, would you share some bread with me?\ufb02 So my brother as he was taught by my mom, he took the loaf of bread, he broke it in half, handed it to this stranger.

You don\u2122t even know where you\u2122re going.\ufb02 So my brother says, \ufb01Well, wherever we\u2122re going, we going. Whatever will happen will happen to both of us.\ufb02 He says, \ufb01I\u2122m going tell you something. When you get up tomorrow morning and you don\u2122t see me here, don\u2122t be surprised. But when you arrive in the gulags, if somebody asks you for your name, you tell them that you are Uncle Misha.\ufb02 My brother\u2122s name was Manasha (ph), in the Russian, Misha. Dyadya (ph) Misha. So my brother just didn\u2122t pay attention, said this crazy man what is he telling me. That\u2122s all. So at night, he was sleeping, he wakes up, the man is not there. My brother thought, did he have a dream? He looks at his bread, half a bread is gone. So he must have given it to somebody, and, okay. He said, well, maybe the man, maybe the NKBG put up a man, you know how you start to think. Well, he arrives in those gulags and in Siberia wherever he was there, I don\u2122t know, and then he stands there and you register, register you and they ask him, \ufb01What\u2122s your name?\ufb02 He says, \ufb01Manasha (ph) Galperin.\ufb02 The man said to him, \ufb01Do you have another name?\ufb02 My brother said, \ufb01No, I don\u2122t have another name.\ufb02 He says, \ufb01In Russian they call me Misha.\ufb02 He says, \ufb01Dyadya (ph) Misha?\ufb02 He\u2122s, he figures what can he lose, he will say. He say, \ufb01Yes.\ufb02 He say, \ufb01Well you are assigned to go to work in the infirmary.\ufb02 You see, in Russia, this underworld, even in the jails, even in the gulags, they had at that time Nesse Godin 36 December 14, 1995 Page 36 there, how do you say, underground. This man was one of this Russian Mafia or underworld or something. So because of this half a bread, my brother say, always says, he says he wouldn\u2122t have survived the conditions there if he would have had to go to in the mines or, or do other work. But because he had this, this, so he says, it pays to share your bread. And I tell young people now too, I said you always think you don\u2122t have much but if you have a quarter, give a dime to somebody. You never know when it\u2122ll come back. So it was interesting.

            "question": "Nesse, I wonder if you\u2122d go back and talk first of all briefly about the circumstances of your father being taken. But then when did your mother give up hope of his being alive? I think it was, don\u2122t think she knew for sure what had happened to him.",
            "answer": "Well I tell you. The children selection, as I speak in detail on my videotape which I\u2122m sure you heard that, my father was taken on that selection and when they were taken away, the people on the railroads, the people that worked on the railroads, our Jewish community council, the, the, whatever, the Unruh (ph) or whatever you call them, they tried very hard to find out from different sources where were they taken to. And at that time, we knew that they were taken towards Poland. We did not know, every individual did not know exactly about gas chambers and, and Nesse Godin 37 December 14, 1995 Page 37 crematorias but now after all these years, I understand that maybe our leadership knew already, that there were such things, such camps. But they were afraid to tell to the everyday person what was happening in those camps. So there were rumors that they were taken to another camp in Poland, with no name. We didn\u2122t know Auschwitz, or no Auschwitz or whatever. What I remember at that time after the children selection after my father was taken, the mood in the ghetto was terrible. People started to believe in astrology, in astronomy. People sat in their houses and made seances, holding their hands and sitting at the table and saying to the table, if the children is, are alive, move three times, or move one time. And people really believed that those tables were moving. All kinds of stupid, started to believing cards, in laying out cards. I think this was all to have a flicker of hope, to not to give up. My dear friend, when you take a thousand children, among them infants that couldn\u2122t live one day without being taken care of, pushing them in, later on when I was taken in those trains, and I was already at that time 16 years old, I was thinking about how did those children live even to arrive? Somewhere. But after we were liberated, after I came back to Feldafing, people, and had already documentation that this transport was taken to Auschwitz. It was wishful thinking when, when I was reunited with my mom, we still hoped, we still thought that maybe they\u2122re alive. Maybe they\u2122ll be reunited. But when we arrived in Feldafing and I remember that Nesse Godin 38 December 14, 1995 Page 38 first high (ph) holidays that we were in Feldafing and it was decided to say prayer for the dead, for those children. At that time it was already, hope was given up. I myself, for many years, I used to have a dream. I used to dream that I\u2122m coming to some remote place and there is my father. And I used to say, \ufb01Papa, where have you been? We\u2122ve been looking for you.\ufb02 But I don\u2122t have the dream anymore. Years ago I stopped dreaming that and I really thought that was my wishful dream. I was hoping that one day I will find him. Now I gave up a long time ago to find him alive because we knew that they were all killed. But even, I don\u2122t know how many years ago when the Red Cross came up, that they found a documentation, they have in Baltimore some research and all that, and I wrote a letter to them saying that my father was taken on the fifth of November of 1943 with the selection. It has been proved that they were taken to Auschwitz. They were not even given numbers. What I am looking for is how many days did this transport travel. Why was I looking for it? Because I light a candle on the day that my father was taken. He was still alive. I thought maybe if I would know four days later, three days later, know, one letter I\u2122ve gotten back from the Red Cross saying they cannot find my father. And after calling them back and telling them and explaining that I know you cannot find him, he\u2122s dead, just I need that information. They never found that information. Now I think that the museum got some new information, some archives Nesse Godin 39 December 14, 1995 Page 39 in the former Soviet Union because Auschwitz was liberated. So one day I\u2122m going to upstairs and look and see if there is new information on that. So I light a candle on the day that my father was taken and I let it burn for a whole week, thinking, is that the right day, that, when he died, within my tradition, Jewish tradition, to light a candle."

You see when you talk to a survivor, we wander away to another space, to another place, to another happening, but that\u2122s okay because it\u2122s, since we are sitting in my house we have this privilege of going back and remembering of things that are important for history. Going back to Feldafing, now, the way as I told you Feldafing was organized, it was overseen by the Unruh (ph) and ran a little bit by the own Jewish community. At the beginning you had, as I said, you had to go to the main kitchens to get your food, later on you received your, your rations whatever was assigned to you and I\u2122m sure it was enough calories for you to, to live on. I remember we got rations of peanut butter Nesse Godin 40 December 14, 1995 Page 40 and peanut butter and peanut butter since, since the displaced person camp, I really never liked peanut butter. And dried condensed milk. And it was wonderful but it was still rationed. Eventually, people started to get little jobs like my husband got the job in the kitchen. My brother was working for the, well the clothing distribution and food distribution. At one time he was like a judge in the camp because if there were disputes among ourselves, among, in the Jewish community, it was taken care of by our own people. We had our own police that made sure that everything is taken care of properly. People started to work outside of the camp. After a few years, the people started, some people started little businesses, some shoemaker started to make shoes, some tailor started to make clothing. Some people started to barter, it became a barter system. Now we ourselves, as soon as my aunt found out that we were alive, we remembered her address, s he lived on Sherman and Euclid (ph) Streets in Washington, D.C. They had a tiny little grocery story, it was called Sal\u2122s (ph) Market. In those days, you didn\u2122t have zip codes, you didn\u2122t have to write the zip code. We wrote a letter, Sal\u2122s (ph) Market, Sherman and Euclid (ph) Streets, Washington, D.C. My aunt got, she went to some relatives that had more money. You had to give a security so otherwise you couldn\u2122t bring a family. You have to show that the family is, can take care of the people that they are going to bring. So she had, we had some distant cousins, some of them were car dealer, Nesse Godin 41 December 14, 1995 Page 41 some of them at liquor store and they all signed that we would be taken care of for the family. But although those documents were done here, we could not leave Germany. Because we were from Lithuania. The United States had a quota system. I\u2122m saying it very carefully because at one time people said, Nesse didn\u2122t have a quarter, that\u2122s why she didn\u2122t come to United States. Quota system was x amount of people were allowed to come from each country to the United States. That was in effect for many years. Now there was no more Lithuania, Lithuania was absorbed by the Russians, by the Soviet Union, but still, we the displaced persons had to come on this quota. So, assuming, if they let in a hundred people of Lithuanian descent to the United States, we had to wait our turn. So while we were in the displaced person camp, Jack and I had two children there, in the camp."

            "answer": "My oldest daughter Panina (ph) was born in 1947, Ed was born 1949. Now as I started to tell you, people started to have little businesses, raise a little money. Now my aunt started to send us packages, packages of clothing and packages of cigarettes, coffee. The German people were very anxious to have chocolate and cigarettes and coffee. So there was a barter system. Let\u2122s say if I wanted to have a sewing machine so I could sew something, I gave the man so many cigarettes and he gave me the old sewing machine. Or if I wanted some bed linens, if I gave him Nesse Godin 42 December 14, 1995 Page 42 this coffee, he gave, that was a barter system. People don\u2122t understand that, how at the beginning you didn\u2122t even need money. We didn\u2122t have money. You started to barter things and once later, people started to have jobs and little businesses in the displaced person camp. After a while, schools were set up for younger children. Now we didn\u2122t have at the beginning, children per se because there were no children from the camps but as people started to come like my aunt came from the occupied Russia, she had a twelve year old, he needed schooling. So there were children, so they had to have the schooling. Also, vocational schools were set up. I myself went to a vocational school to learn how to sew. Because people said when you come to America, it\u2122s very good to know how to sew. People went to learn languages. I went to learn English. At one time I went and I took a course in bookkeeping. People said if you go to America, it\u2122s very good to be a bookkeeper but they didn\u2122t tell me that you need, need, need a certified acc ounting degree. So peoples resumed a little bit a life and started to earn a little money. By the time, I would say maybe 1947, \u212248, people had already little money. People started to work, some people started to work in Jewish agencies for the American government. I don\u2122t know really of anybody that really worked for any German per se company."

The only thing was in some places you, you were in more __________ barracks. Here at the beginning we just had the barracks, then they gave us those villas so all of a sudden we had like a bigger camp. Within the camp, some Zionist organizations were organized. I remember Ben Gur Yon (ph) coming to Israel, to, from Israel to Feldafing and I remember the whole camp was decorated with paper. With tissue paper. Now I did not know, I just found out by watching the tape of the liberators, a testimony of a person that was in charge of the camp telling how the Jews in the displaced person camp decorated with toilet paper, the whole camp. Now at that time, I didn\u2122t know what, they just took this toilet paper, twisted it and it became like decorations. We, we started within our own camp to have a little theater group, lectures, that we, the younger people were encouraged to go. Now as I said, I got, I got married very young. And I had to, I had my children, I had to take care of them. And because I had my mom, I could attend some of those lectures and go to some of those classes. But some of my own friends had the opportunity and they went back to school right away and got their college degrees in Germany. I have a friend who became a nurse. Now in the five years that I was personally in the displaced Nesse Godin 44 December 14, 1995 Page 44 person camp, until we got our permission to come to the United States, I worked as a secretary in between the camp at one time but most of all I did some alterations for people because I learned how to sew. So I redid a hem or, or as I told you I was so lucky that I had that sewing machine that I bartered for cigarettes. So I was a big maha (ph). And that\u2122s really, we did not have much at all. We came to the United States without a penny in our pocket."

But I just didn\u2122t want to think about it or talk about, I don\u2122t know. So now if I had tuberculosis of the glands, they had to check me for a year so I wouldn\u2122t bring tuberculosis to the United States. So we were postponed for another year. They found always an excuse why you shouldn\u2122t come. I remember my mom went for her examination and she was so nervous she couldn\u2122t urinate at that time. So they, they wrote down Nesse Godin 45 December 14, 1995 Page 45 that she had trouble with her bladder. My mom says you know how you go to the doctor sometime, you cannot give a sample? For, for the test? Little things. Then finally, finally already we were, we got our quota, we are ready to go. I was pregnant with my son. They wouldn\u2122t let me go because I was pregnant. They said I have to wait until he was born, until he was a year old. And constantly postponing and postponing and people were frustrated. People wanted to go anywhere. They didn\u2122t care where, who, what, who would let \u201aem in. Yes, we personally really wanted to come to the United States. Cause my mom, four of her brothers and sister, two brothers and two sisters were killed in the Holocaust with their families and she had that one sister. She really wanted to come to be with her sister. This is, and with me, I was so young. My mother was the boss. Like she told me to get married, she told me I have to go to America. My brother, he felt that after suffering for so many years, we should have our own country. He is a Zionist, he lives in Israel and he, although it meant separation again from the rest of the family, he chose to go to Israel. And I remember his saying, he said, \ufb01We are free people. If God will help us, we\u2122ll be able to see each other. We\u2122ll be able to visit each other.\ufb02 And the truth is that Jack and I, that\u2122s the only vacations we take.

            "answer": "Well, I tell you. There was differences of opinion. I cannot say to you that everybody was patriotic, wanted to go to Israel. I myself as, as a young woman of 18, 19, 20, I was afraid of war. I didn\u2122t want to go to a place where there was war. I wanted to go to a place and I thought of America, I, we thought, gee in America, all the people, black and white and Jews and non-Jews live together. What I have learned about America even in the displaced person camp; the country of freedom, the songs of freedom, where no slavery and no this and no that. I came here I was a little bit disappointed to find all this and even now, even within last week when I see among our own ranks in the military, prejudice, white supremacist, Nazi __________, but to me, America at that time was the country where I thought I could live my life and my children as Jews, free. And I still think that this is the best country in the world. As I say, at the very beginning, at the very beginning they, it was like again , like a jail. We had the curfew, we were not allowed to do this and that and the other. There was, okay, there was American people that were in charge and even German police of the city. Even German, like when I came, why couldn\u2122t I register in the camp? I had to go to the German police to register that I am Nesse Godin 47 December 14, 1995 Page 47 there. And that was traumatic. So even this still had to go through the German authority. I don\u2122t know, maybe they meant well. They meant well whoever was in charge. Maybe they thought it\u2122s, that\u2122s a good way to do it. But until really it was given over more to the Jewish people to run their own, their own little camp how you say, it was difficult. It was difficult. I know, I used to even in 1947, when I went with the baby carriage into the little town out of, the camp was a little bit away from the little town. I don\u2122t know if you have a picture of Feldafing, well that\u2122s small, small little town, not a big town. And I think I had a feeling at that time at the beginning that like the German people looked and said, what is she doing here with a baby carriage? She belongs somewhere else. And many times we heard that. We heard the people say, although we understood German very well, what are they doing here? They belong in the camp. But later on, later on things really changed. There were young people that grew up that were children or teenagers and were more compassionate. There were people that we met, my mom by saying we, my mom and I, especially there was one lady, we called her oma (ph), grandma, that suffered from the Nazis. She was a German lady. Her husband was a postmaster before the war, before the Nazis took over. And he was put in jail and she was left with two children, two teenagers. And one day she just came, somehow, she saw my mother and she walked over and she said, \ufb01Lady, I\u2122m a German lady that suffered Nesse Godin 48 December 14, 1995 Page 48 from the Nazis and if you would just let me come and clean your house and help you, I would be grateful if you would just give me a little wood or a little food,\ufb02 and we befriended that lady and we just loved her and so. There were different relationship, different people but in later years, Feldafing was not a uncomfortable place to be in, not a uncomfortable place to be in. It was like I said, a Jewish police, a Jewish little like a government and if you needed a extra coat or something there was like a, people that received packages, were not given as much as the ones that were, the social system was a little more righteous at that point. But I, I am, as, as a person that lived there for five years and talking to other survivors that were in Lunzberg (ph) or in Fairenweld (ph) or in Hightenhime (ph) or in different, it was pretty much the same. It was pretty much the same. People at the beginning, naturally having to be on ration and so forth and later on, people, people that were a little bit older that knew how to open a little business, they actually let the people started to sell equipment for a tailor, let\u2122s say a thread and zippers and buttons. They went somewhere and bought a little bit, came back to the camp and, and sold it to the tailors and raised a little money, so small little businesses I would say the type like the years ago, the pushcart peddler."

And there is cultural little events, our own Jewish community started to feel that we have to bring from, we started to bring from one displaced person camp to another, our, our stars, our, our little singers and dancers and, and, and people that survived that were actors in Poland. They started to bring old movies that were made years ago, Yiddish movies for us to see and to learn about. Eventually they started to bring operas for people that should get, like me, I never knew what an opera was. To learn that there is such thing as operas. People that were poets started to write songs and poems about the lives in the ghetto. Also people that remembered the songs that were born in the ghettos, in the camps, they were documented. Some of Nesse Godin 51 December 14, 1995 Page 51 the people were not even alive anymore that wrote those songs but some were. So all these be, started to be documented. They started to do books on, memorial books from their communities. They got like we are sitting now, at that time we didn\u2122t have tape recorders, everything had to be done on the typewriter or longhand or whoever knew shorthand to put, start to take testimonies of people. They started to look for witnesses that could stand up at those trials and say I was there, this is, this what happened. They, we had right away Jewish doctors that participated right away in Feldafing in the hospital with helping people. My children were delivered by Jewish doctors. The people in their professions that people that were loyal so, businessmen started somehow to, to participate in that field in the community. In five years, you could see the difference in the people. When we left Feldafing, it was already a different community. It wasn\u2122t just a victim community, it was already a survivors\u2122 community. That\u2122s the difference.

            "answer": "Well, I tell you. When my oldest daughter was born, my mother was so happy. Although she was a girl, she could hardly wait to name her after my father. We name after the dead in Jewish tradition. And although I\u2122m sure she knew that eventually I would have another child, there may be a boy, she could hardly wait to have that name. And it was like a rebirth, rebirth, not just rebirth to the individuals, it was a rebirth to the community. Every child that was born, it was not just your joy but the whole house, like five, six families were excited about that. Now when our son was born, that was really very, very special because Jack is the only survivor of his family. He cannot even stand to listen to me talk about the Holocaust. But can you imagine there was a Godin? He stood there and he just say, \ufb01Godin, Godin, Godin.\ufb02 That\u2122s all he was saying. That\u2122s all he was saying. He didn\u2122t even and Ed is named after his father. His name is Edward Isaac, Edward after my grandfather, my mom\u2122s father, who died a natural death before the war and after Jack\u2122s father. My oldest daughter is named after his mother too, my father and his mother. We always tried to give \u201aem two names so people would, all those people would be Nesse Godin 53 December 14, 1995 Page 53 remembered. And that\u2122s all I really remember and I\u2122ll tell you the truth. Even when our grandson Gabe was born, our son\u2122s son, Jack, that\u2122s second time in his life that I saw him, so emotional that that name Godin will continue. When the, I was __________, I say, \ufb01Look at, look at him, he\u2122s so cute, such a cute baby!\ufb02 __________, he said, \ufb01Godin, Godin, Godin,\ufb02 that\u2122s all he said. So it really, you cannot describe those feelings. You really cannot describe those feelings because something happens in a family. Even in our own community here when we had this last spring were this poor people were killed. And I always says that this woman had a Holocaust. The husband and the children killed in one day. Can you imagine? Masses of families destroyed and you all grieve together and no counseling. So each child that was born, each thing good that happened was like a miracle, like a miracle. If somebody got married, you didn\u2122t have brothers and sisters to invite, you invited your, your, your neighbors that were your adopted brothers and sisters. Up to this day, we have friends that we lived in the displaced person camp together. They were strangers but they were our family. I just went to Cleveland to see a lady that lived under us. We, our room was over hers and unfortunately she never had children. When I went to see her now, she has diabetes, she had a leg amputated and that\u2122s all she was talking, she was saying, \ufb01That\u2122s all I remember is Eddie running around upstairs with his little feet,\ufb02 so.

Weren\u2122t you afraid that somebody will come and kill them?\ufb02 I didn\u2122t and I don\u2122t know why I didn\u2122t think so. Maybe, I never thought that way. I was overprotective to my children, I\u2122m still overprotective. Now Nesse Godin 55 December 14, 1995 Page 55 you, you, it may be stupid to say on the tape but I\u2122ll say it. You see this stupid crocodile there? I always, when my kids go away on the beautiful vacation, I say watch out for the crocodiles. And my daughter in law who\u2122s a new daughter in law, she\u2122s lovely woman, to, my son was married and divorced and remarried and she said, \ufb01There\u2122s no crocodiles where we are going.\ufb02 And I said to her, \ufb01It\u2122s not really the crocodiles, it\u2122s the memories. It\u2122s the experience in life that I went through. It\u2122s the fears and anxieties and I call them crocodiles.\ufb02 So she came back and brought me a crocodile there, so, this is very normal. If you experience something, whether a dog bites you or a disease, you\u2122re scared of it. You\u2122re scared of it. And we survivors are all overprotective of, for our children. Always thinking something will happen. Don\u2122t go here, don\u2122t go there and in reverse, our children are super kids. They always are afraid to do wrong because they don\u2122t want to hurt the parents. When I was very young and talk with my son, he always said, \ufb01I never wanted you to cry, mom. I always thought if I\u2122ll be bad and you will cry, I will hurt you and you were hurt so much.\ufb02 The most of the survivors are overprotective of the children and in turn, the children are super achievers because they want to do good to their parents because they suffered so much."

            "answer": "Now in Feldafing they tried very hard to have different schools for the children. Nesse Godin 56 December 14, 1995 Page 56 As I said at the beginning, before we had children children, I mean tiny babies, when the, some families that were in hiding, or had the opportunity to escape to the Soviet Union, they came back with children. Among Holocaust survivors, there were no children unless you had a child in hiding and you picked it up. So they started schools. In the barracks there was no schoolhouse, in the barracks, in one of the barracks and they had, there were some teachers from, that were teachers from before the war that started to teach those children. Not just a Hebrew school, the math and the language and history and they, they had some rabbis or rabbinical students that taught them prayers, and taught them, it, it was from scratch. You had a few kids of different ages, maybe you had two, three kids that were nine years old and five kids that were twelve years old. So it was really difficult. Then as we were, when my oldest daughter was three years old, two and a half years old, she went to kindergarten. They started from the beginning. So then you had this type of school. Then you had schools like for me. Kids that went at the age of 13 into the camps, okay, I got married but I still wanted to go to school. So my mom was with my daughter when she was already born and I went like to a night school like we have here night school to catch up for what I did not have opportunity because of the war. We had a vocational school. Also in one of the barracks, men were learning locksmith, they were learning car mechanic, mostly women were learning Nesse Godin 57 December 14, 1995 Page 57 sewing. Mostly sewing because everybody said wherever you go, sewing will be useful. There were courses, I remember even taking a course how to make brassieres. Cause in Europe you made brassieres to order. There was no such thing you went in bought already brassiere. So I was learning, I think I still have upstairs the books of where I learned how to take. So there was very much really organized, even a synagogue. We didn\u2122t have a synagogue per se. We used one of those holes or one of those barracks as a synagogue where we came on the holiday to pray. Now let\u2122s say Passover came. Well did we, could we order from the bakery marker (ph)? It had to be done right there. Everything was like make right there. They decided okay, we have this place, we have the oven, we\u2122ll make a mattriss (ph). It was, everything was like new, like, like a beginning, like starting. It\u2122s not that you moved in in a town where you can convert and say, okay, we going to that school. And it was, I think, I think, that in the short time that we were in those displaced person camps, a lot of wonderful things were done. The only thing unfortunately that I feel that was not done is to give us counseling. There was no such thing as counseling. But I really don\u2122t know when this counseling really came into effect where people really started to believe that counseling is a good idea after you live through a trauma. Maybe in those days they didn\u2122t believe in that. I really feel that\u2122s the only thing that we should have had. After traumatic lives like this, is Nesse Godin 58 December 14, 1995 Page 58 some type of counseling and that was not."

Why did I want to talk about it? As I always say in the most horrible times during the Holocaust, we used to sit and talk to each other, the women, hungry, cold, all the women used to say, please don\u2122t forget us.

So always wanted, always said, \ufb01Those women asked me to talk about it.\ufb02 But when I came to the United States, even my aunt who loved me, who helped me, my cousins that were dear to me, they always said, you suffered enough, don\u2122t talk about it. So who did we, we talk to about it? Survivors to each other! We started to, because we didn\u2122t have families, in, I was fortunate to have my mom, she became like in our Washington area, the mom of everybody. Five, six couples, survivors coming to our house on the Sabbath, having a little lunch, what did we talk about? The Holocaust. Comparing each other\u2122s suffering, telling how it was, talking about how by miracle we survived this selection and that selection and in a way, I think this was really beneficial to us. Many times we say enough already talking Holocaust but I think that this was good. At least we talked it out, we didn\u2122t keep it Nesse Godin 60 December 14, 1995 Page 60 inside. Now many times, people will say to me, as you know I go out to speak to many, many schools and people will say, well it must become easier as you talk about it. But this is not true.

You just hope that you live that day and you go Nesse Godin 61 December 14, 1995 Page 61 through. But I tell you. I really feel, my personal feeling that it was of compassion of all the women than me. Jewish women that I\u2122m maybe here. Never forget, never forget a woman that, her name was Mrs. Fivish (ph). I remember her name. She was from my hometown. She used to call me over and say, \ufb01Nesa, come over. I\u2122ll wrap your body in straw.\ufb02 And first I thought what she crazy, why would she want to wrap me in straw. I didn\u2122t understand that this is insulation, that that will keep me warm. Now did she save my life? Another time, I used to like to leave a little piece of bread for the next morning and so I tore off a little piece of blanket, I wrapped it in the little bite of bread. The whole bread was like one slice and if I ate three-fourths of it, there was just one bite really of bread left over. And I wrapped it in that little cloth and put it in the straw under my head. The next morning the bread wasn\u2122t there. And I cried. I was a little girl, I cried. I cried, I was hungry. Another lady, \ufb01Little girl, why you crying?\ufb02 \ufb01Oh, I put my bread in the piece of cloth and maybe a mouse came and, and ate it.\ufb02 And she, I remember her saying, \ufb01Child, no mouse ate your bread. People around us are hungry. Give me your little bread, I\u2122ll put it in my bosom and I will save it for you.\ufb02 And you see, I had no bosom, it would have fallen through. So she, every morning, she could\u2122ve eaten up that bread, she, she gave me, I used to go over and say, \ufb01Lady,\ufb02 I even forgot her name now. I\u2122m sure I knew her name at that time. And I used to say, \ufb01Would you hold my little bread?\ufb02 Nesse Godin 62 December 14, 1995 Page 62 And the next morning she, \ufb01Here child, here\u2122s your little bread.\ufb02 She could\u2122ve swallowed it. She was hungry too. Now did she help me? When I was beaten up so severely on the death march, if it wouldn\u2122t be for women that held me under my arms and that\u2122s all I heard \u201aem say, \ufb01Walk. Don\u2122t give up, walk.\ufb02 I really think that there was a lot of compassion, a lot of help, a lot of moral support among the inmates in the concentration camps. We always say oh, this one was bad, that one was bad, here there were bad people too but most of the people were there for each other."

So we had to go to the medical examination and then we were taken to Bremen where this, where the ports are but we were outside of Bremen in a place, I don\u2122t remember anymore what the name of the place was: Weeldflecken (ph) or something like this. It was like a camp where you stayed three or four weeks, it\u2122s like a quarantine thing to make sure that you are in good health.

And there we were already, thanks God, all of us together: my mom, my husband, myself and the two kids. Three and a half years old and one year old. And after the few weeks that we had to be there, we were put on a Army boat. It was called the SS Blatchford (ph). It was a General Blatchford (ph) boat called the Army boat. Now I was assigned with the two children to be in a cabin. Women that had children were in a cabin. Listen to that and you will understand, was that a right thing to do or a wrong thing to do? My husband was separated, put into the hole in the boat. Now my mom, because she was a single person and at that time she was 52 years old, she was assigned somewhere else. So to us, it was traumatic to be separation. Whoever made this arrangement didn\u2122t think of it. Here we are going to America and children separate, mother separate, husband separate."

I don\u2122t know, two weeks or whatever we traveled on the ocean, I don\u2122t remember even how long. It was such a storm. One night I remember my mom coming up to me in the cabin and she laid Nesse Godin 65 December 14, 1995 Page 65 down next to me, she said, \ufb01My child, if we die in this ocean, let\u2122s at least be together.\ufb02 She said, \ufb01I don\u2122t care if they\u2122re going to throw me out, if they\u2122re going to put me in a jail, I\u2122m going to lay right here with you, with the children in the cabin.\ufb02 So I, as I thought, years later, we were excited to go to the United States but why wasn\u2122t there a little compassion? Those people were separated from their families. Why separate \u201aem again? Poor Jack. He was laying there seasick. He was terrible seasick. We thought they\u2122re going to throw him into the water, that\u2122s how sick he was. He was by himself. Wouldn\u2122t have been easier for us to be together? So that was the journey. We arrived in New York. Now when we came you didn\u2122t go to Ellis Island, that was no more. You arrive there and you had to wait for your documents to be processed. Now if you had family, then the family was allowed to go into that room and my aunt and my cousin came from Washington, all the way, to New York to wait for us and that was the most exciting thing that ever happened to us. Cause here the dream came true. The, the family, at least one person of a aunt and a cousin, for five years we didn\u2122t know what that meant. And we slept over one night in New York with some distant relatives and the next day we were in the car traveling to Washington. I like to tell you this because it may sound stupid to anybody but it\u2122s a experience of newcomers. We are traveling in the car from New York to Washington, they didn\u2122t have the turnpike at that time. You had to go on a Nesse Godin 66 December 14, 1995 Page 66 ferry across the Delaware.

I couldn\u2122t understand how we are moving and, and he\u2122s bringing food in the car. I didn\u2122t realize that we were on a ferry and the ferry was moving. Little things that you have an experience or something that you could never forget. And we were, we came to the United States, we came to live for a few weeks with my aunt and my uncle and my cousins into their house. My aunt and my uncle were very kind. They had rented an apartment for us the year before thinking that we were coming but because we were not allowed to come until Ed was a year old, they had subrented it and it took two more weeks for us to be able to go to that apartment. So we stayed in their small house, they were very kind, they were very supportive, they were very sweet but they didn\u2122t want to hear anything about a Holocaust."

Now she was right too, but, again, people come to us, survivors and they will say, \ufb01How come you didn\u2122t talk about your experiences?\ufb02 Many of us were willing to talk but Nesse Godin 67 December 14, 1995 Page 67 no one would listen. So after being there for two weeks, we came into our own apartment. Our apartment was at 529 LaMont (ph) Street in Washington, D.C., a one bedroom apartment. We were my mom, my husband, myself and the two children. We had a bed in the bedroom and a crib that someone had given to us for Ed cause he was a baby. My mom and my daughter Panina (ph) was three and half years old, slept in the living room on a couch. W were so glad to have two rooms and a kitchen and a bathroom inside of the, cause in the displaced person camp we still had to go to bathroom, we shared with other people a bathroom, so this was really something special. And we just couldn\u2122t count enough our blessings, to be here but then reality came. Reality came that we are in a new country without professions, without money. We couldn\u2122t sit there although in the paper it said that my aunt is going to support us but we couldn\u2122t expect them to support us and we started to hunt for jobs. We were really not skilled although I learned a little bit at sewing, I didn\u2122t know, I didn\u2122t know how to make a dress. Maybe I knew how to sew a hem. Poor Jack, he was involved in the, in the displaced person camp working in that kitchen, managing that kitchen. But what would he do here? He knew less English than I knew cause he was working already in the displaced person camp while I was going a little bit to school. So this was very difficult. Lucky my aunt and my uncle knew some people that had a glass business and they gave Jack a job to Nesse Godin 68 December 14, 1995 Page 68 carry crates of glass, carry them out of the truck into the warehouse, from the warehouse into the truck, labor work. Natural when we say now 75 cents an hour, it may seem very little but that was minimum wage at that time, 1950, \u212251. We will came here the end of \u212250, \u212251. And with me, because my mother was with us and she could take care of the children, I could go to work. So through talking to some neighbors in that building, I was asked to come for an interview in a place on Connecticut Avenue. It was called the King Needlework Services. And to, the lady was very kind, very compassionate, her name was Mrs. King and she really did not worry too much that I didn\u2122t know how to sew. She was willing to give me a job. And that\u2122s how we started to earn our living. And continue our life in the United States bit by bit with the hope that we can give to our children a better life than we had."

Yes it is difficult for us survivors to come there, to help out, to open our wounds again and again but those wounds were never really closed. They never really closed. The only wonderful thing is when I come there and I say when I am dead, generations to come will learn what really happened. Generations will come, learn, understand and my promise to the dead people will be fulfilled. But this is not enough. I think by being there so much and what I see and what I hear from the visitors that come, when they walk out those doors from the museum, they are different people. They will be a little more compassionate. I hope they will look at each other and not see colors and not see religions and not see where I came from, from this country or Nesse Godin 71 December 14, 1995 Page 71 from that country, they will see another human being that they will respect and honor and through this, I hope, we can make our own lives richer. We can make our beautiful country that we live in, the United States of America, better. And we as examples to the world, that humanity should live together. We were not created to be exactly alike. Whether, whether evolution or God, I happen to be a, a believer, I, if God wanted us to look alike he would clone us exactly. He made us different, that\u2122s it."

            "answer": "Yeah. Well I\u2122m going to tell you. I always said and I considered myself one of the survivors that\u2122s open, talking to my children. When I sa w a book that said survivors\u2122 children and they said they were neurotic and they were this and they were that, I was annoyed. But the truth is that we survivors were always overprotective to our children because of the experiences that we went through. Now I always thought you, my kids were not affected in the Holocaust but my son has said, __________ , told me when he was a little boy, he was afraid that the Nazis will come for him. When I, actually didn\u2122t tell me that, I saw it written up in the paper, when he gave a interview to somebody. And I came to him, he said, \ufb01Yeah and I was afraid to tell you.\ufb02 So as adjusted our family is and as we are very Nesse Godin 72 December 14, 1995 Page 72 different. Now we were both protective. Because we suffered, we wanted our children to have more. We, Jack and I were never in business, we were always working people. We, I don\u2122t want to say it, but we sacrificed ourself so our children would have college educations but in turn they did their share. They made sure that they are achievers, maybe little overachievers because as we chatted during lunch, I said that kids didn\u2122t want us to suffer no more. My kids always said, \ufb01Ma, we don\u2122t want you to cry because you cried enough.\ufb02 So we can proudly say, we have two daughters that are teachers, our son a engineer and now thanks God we have five wonderful grandchildren and we do have the most wonderful children in law.

I started to tell you before, I go to a beautiful restaurant, I go to the salad bar, there\u2122s a line. I stand with my plate for food and all of a sudden I get the chill. Why do I get the chill? It reminds me of standing in line for food. Many times I will come back to the table with a empty plate. And whoever I\u2122m there, they Nesse Godin 73 December 14, 1995 Page 73 will say, \ufb01Didn\u2122t you take any salad?\ufb02 I say, \ufb01No I\u2122ll go later for it.\ufb02 Who would understand that?

How can you not be affected? Naturally if you were affected, it goes over to your children. If my children left food on the plate, unconsciously I said, \ufb01Oh the kids in the Holocaust would\u2122ve really been happy to have that.\ufb02 Or saying, \ufb01Please don\u2122t waste food, there\u2122s hungry children in the world.\ufb02 So it does carry over without even thinking about it, you influence your children, your, when my grandchildren was little, I was sitting and watching \ufb01The Wizard of Oz\ufb02, beautiful show, right?

            "answer": "Well I want to tell you something. People don\u2122t realize what that bowl and spoon meant. That was your lifeline. If many a times, if a soldier wanted to play around, he took and shot a bullet through your, through your bowl. When you go to the museum and see holes in those bowls, you think oh those are old bowls. If you look carefully many of them have precise holes where a bullet went through. How did you eat? You couldn\u2122t throw this away and go get another bowl. They didn\u2122t, you couldn\u2122t say, excuse me my bowl has a hole. No such thing. So that became your lifeline. We watched that spoon and that bowl like, like, like the most precious thing in the world. But as I told you, when I was taken to that hospital, everything, I don\u2122t have anything, anything, anything, to show, or to share from that time. See some people that were a little older maybe had the wisdom to save something. Or even in the hospital to say, can I have back my bowl? But I didn\u2122t understand to say that. So I didn\u2122t. I know some people that went back on a visit to Auschwitz, just in, ten years ago, five years ago and they were able to purchase there, they have like gift Nesse Godin 76 December 14, 1995 Page 76 shops there where you can purchase things. Just like a memorabilia, so they, they did that. But like I have, I\u2122m sure you heard my testimony about the money with the cat with the __________ document.

But that is a symbol of my life. But I did not have the wisdom at that time to save anything, so I didn\u2122t, but I can understand that people didn\u2122t want to give up that bowl and that, that spoon.

Some people say why didn\u2122t you run away? To run away you need a place to run to. My brother was lucky he had that friend to run to. Nobody wanted me, I tried to run and, and, and people that tried to run many times, the neighbor said, here goes the Jew, shoot him. Why did they do that? So you become numb and you just pray to live through and if you have the, the, well it\u2122s, it\u2122s the animal in us that wants to live, survival. This is the bottom line.

If you were with one of your family, maybe they were picking it out of your head like the monkeys sat there and pick. If not, you sat and you picked your own. You got infected from that. That\u2122s how we had this, those one typhoids, I don\u2122t know which one, typhoid or typhus that comes from the lice. It\u2122s a infection like. It, it was just unbelievable. I cannot believe now sometime I close my eyes and I think, I hope that was a dream. Cannot, you cannot believe what things we went through. I, I don\u2122t remember if my originally testimony, you, you listened to that. We were on the death march and we were sitting there so hungry, so hungry, so thirsty. Women were eating a little bit snow, then all of a sudden I saw women were running to something in the snow so I ran too. I didn\u2122t even know what I was running for and that, there was some blobs in the snow and everybody grabbed a piece and I grabbed a piece and then we, so women were washing it in the snow, so I washed it in the snow. What was inside? It was manure for cow. And when a cow eats, they, she doesn\u2122t digest the grain. So Nesse Godin 79 December 14, 1995 Page 79 when they had straw, there was a little grain and the women said, \ufb01This is nourishment. Let\u2122s open those little grains, wash them in the snow and eat \u201aem.\ufb02 And we ate \u201aem. Now if somebody on the outside would have looked on to us, they would say look at those animals! Look what they\u2122re doing! But I think we did the most wonderful thing that there is to do in humanity. God says if you save one life, it\u2122s like you would have saved the whole world? We saved our lives.

When we came to Shtoodruff (ph) and we went through that shower so-called, and we stood outside for a long time naked and then we were given a dress, a pair of underpants, a pair of shoe. They just threw it to us. They didn\u2122t say what size or whatever. Somehow, usually as a rule, you didn\u2122t get your own, any of your own clothing because they figured if you get something of your own maybe you have something sewn in or hidden but somehow our group of women got the same shoes. How do I know that we got the same shoe? I was, in my, what I was handed was a pair of like oxfords, like a woman\u2122s pair of oxford. Big, nice oxford. I came wearing boots. Why did I came with the boots? Because there was a gold coin sewn into the boots and as we were being deported and we were not allowed to take along too much, my mother said, \ufb01Put on the boots.\ufb02 So you, so there, I see a woman, already we were settled in the camp. After a few days went Nesse Godin 81 December 14, 1995 Page 81 by and we were already in the barracks, I see a woman outside carrying my boots and she\u2122s barefoot.

You don\u2122t want an old lady to go around without, without shoes.\ufb02 And I exchanged with her. And this is how I got my boots. Now I put on those boots and I never took them off. I kept them on my feet because of that stupid gold coin. I was afraid somebody will steal my boots and I have this gold coin. Now as I mentioned before, I was with my sister in law who was not really yet my sister in law, in the camp at that time together and she knew about this gold coin. And I kept on asking her, she was seven years older than me, I said, \ufb01Laina (ph) what do you think? Maybe we should exchange this, this gold coin and get some bread.\ufb02 And she said, \ufb01Let\u2122s wait. Times may become tougher. Times may become tougher.\ufb02 Now I was liberated in, with those boots because when time became tougher, no one had extra bread to exchange for a coin. So after I was taken to that so-called hospital, they had to actually cut off, cut up the boots to take off from my feet Nesse Godin 82 December 14, 1995 Page 82 because my feet were frozen and almost like stuck to those boots.

We were not allowed to go take her, buy a, well we didn\u2122t have money. Maybe if we would\u2122ve had money we could take, buy a ticket and go to town, to Munich. At the beginning was not. But later on, your life became pretty much good life. You had your child, you had your mother, you had a husband, you okay, you didn\u2122t have an apartment, you didn\u2122t have, you couldn\u2122t go into the store and shop or like we do now, three pair o\u2122 shoes in one month. But your life was pretty much scheduled. The only thing that really was bad, you still didn\u2122t know where you are. You were a displaced person. You were praying to belong to some country, somewhere, like with us. We went for checkups, we thought we are leaving, no. Again, our hope was up. We think, we thought we were going. No. So all this was the uncertainty. The uncertainty was going to, are you ever going to be able to leave the displaced person? This hung over you. But otherwise, human beings, young people fell in love. People had children. People I\u2122m sure died. People were born, people had weddings. It, it became a pretty so-called in parentheses normal life."

Because we naturally asked, when I found her she was precious, but then if she started to tell me how to raise my kids or what to do, you open your mouth sometime. And then you\u2122re sorry but Jack, never opened his mouth to my mother. Ma, ma, ma, ma, that\u2122s all to, to respect, she, well naturally you didn\u2122t have the privacy for husband and wife, but you see we managed to have two kids with my mother living with us in one room."

            "question": "In your last months in Feldafing, the, the numbers of displaced persons there must have been dwindling. Would you, would you have been there as others were leaving for new lives in Israel or Australia or Britain?",
            "answer": "I want to tell you, it was dwindling and it was not dwindling. Because some other smaller camps were being eliminated so they brought from different, I forgot now from which camps, they brought people. They resettled them to, to Feldafing. Now this even this resettlement for Holocaust survivors is easy to go from one displaced Nesse Godin 87 December 14, 1995 Page 87 person camp to another? It was also tough. Instead of taking a thousand people and shipping them off to the United States, did they have to ship them to another displaced person camp? I, I\u2122ve always thought of that. I always thought, is United States so little that they don\u2122t have room to take and there wasn\u2122t many Holocaust survivors. But people were leaving, you were a little bit jealous when you saw people leaving. Then you heard people were going to Israel on illegal immigration and some of them didn\u2122t succeed and came back and there were different times even in the five years after the war, after the war ended. It was different experiences. But I\u2122m really surprised that there isn\u2122t more documentation on Feldafing."

            "answer": "That\u2122s all people talked in Feldafing is when do we go, where do we go? What country, maybe opportunity country and some people were looking. We didn\u2122t have money to pay off, some people said well, maybe if we would have money, we would hire a German lawyer or an American lawyer. Somebody used to say well, somebody in the, in the United States consulate maybe could help you. You tried to find somebody, somewhere that could help you. That\u2122s all people talked about: Nesse Godin 88 December 14, 1995 Page 88 how to leave. Nobody wanted to stay forever in displaced person camps. This what I say many times when I hear that people that suffered want to keep on staying at the same spot. I say that we Holocaust survivors did not want to say, stay in the same spot. We wanted out of it. Out of the displaced person camp, most of us. Yes we have our memories, yes we\u2122re not going to forget it. But we went forward. We went forward with our lives. We had children, we made sure our children are educated. We put a good name for ourselves in our communities, in our countries right where we are. Wherever we are. I don\u2122t think you find among Holocaust survivors, people in jail. I don\u2122t think so. I may be wrong but I don\u2122t think so."

            "question": "How typical do you think you are in, despite what you suffered, being able it seems to move forward and to sort of focus on the joys in life? Would, would it, would this experience have destroyed many people who\u2122d be so, so hurt, have such a chip on their shoulder that they couldn\u2122t move forward?",
            "answer": "Unfortunately, unfortunately there are many survivors that cannot move forward. And I understand, I understand it. I tell you why, assuming, I would have been already 25 years old, I would have been married. I would have had two, three children. My husband, my children would have been killed and I had to start life all over again. I don\u2122t know if I would be like I am now. I was part of my parents\u2122 family. I was lucky to have my mother survive the Holocaust. Through four years I Nesse Godin 89 December 14, 1995 Page 89 was suffering one year all by myself, was lucky enough to have two brothers, I just had two brother, and both, they suffered but they survived. So I always think that I cannot judge the people that cannot pick up their life and, and I hav e a friend. She was lucky to find her husband but she had two children that were killed in the Holocaust. She had a new child after the war, wonderful child, very devoted but that woman didn\u2122t even dance at her own daughter\u2122s wedding. Cause she promised herself when her children were killed that she\u2122ll never dance again. So it, at her own daughter\u2122s wedding, she didn\u2122t dance. Now can you blame her? Can you say she\u2122s, something wrong with her? No. Yes there are many survivors like me that, most of us, I think, without counseling, we picked ourselves up, we found a spot in the community. We chose to use our suffering to teach others a little more love, a little more compassion, a little more understanding. We\u2122re not throwing our memories, we keeping them. We using them for a purpose. For a purpose to remember the dead within our Jewish tradition and to teach the young, teach the young what can happen if we allow hatred in our hearts. And this is . . . Conclusion of interview."
