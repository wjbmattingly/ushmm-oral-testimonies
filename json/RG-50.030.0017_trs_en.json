And my mother she was with seven kids. It was very, very hard. So that's the beginning of a very, very hard life for all of us. I was very young at this time, maybe ten-years-old, maybe younger.

Not so many like them. We are scared from them and they take advantage of us, that's it. It was very, very hard this time. So even like youngster, and believe me I don't know, I couldn't understand why, why? Because I'm Jew? And I don't see no difference because I was the same thing. We don't have no horn. We don't have nothing. We took the same language. We eat the same thing. And they was so -- they kill. If they can't kill, they beat us. They make all kind of trouble. Sometimes, we saw, they break the windows. They break all these things. Why? Because they were -- they're Jewish family, and believe me at this time we were very, very poor. I remember mine house. When my father died we were very, very poor because we had my mother. She was with seven kids and support seven kids wasn't easy. She have a very, very, very hard life. Very hard life."

At this time it was Hindenburg\u2019 -- Hindenburg lose the power and the German took the power. So when the- 1939 -- just when it was Rosh Hashanah is decreed the war was starting. So the Germans start to come into Poland. I remember when the Pole -- I never want to believe that the Poland going to lose the war. But at this time I was very young so maybe I don't understood very well, but I remember once my mother told me \u2014 she told us, \u201cYou know what, you\u2019ll see, when the Germans come in here, I don't think they are going to handle with us very badly because they not the antisemites like the Polacks. Because,\u201d she say, \u2018I remember in the war in 1914-18 they were very friendly, because we Jews are speaking Jewish\u201d, and the Jewish is a lot like German so we could understood altogether.\u201d And 1t wasn\u2019t -- was like she was saying."

Because maybe I know what we read in the * National Socialist Party (German); Nazi political party in Germany. * Paul von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg (1847-1934); German army officer and statesman, president of Germany 1925-1934. > Yiddish papers, but, you know, we couldn't have no radios, no TV\u2019s and the media was not strong like today. So we don't know exactly everything. But one thing I remember is when Hitler is coming on power, they send out most the Jews from Germany. And the Jews, they come into Poland and lots coming to Warsaw and we was talking with them and they tell us what kind of pogrom was there, you know, with the Kristallnacht and the beating and the -- don't let live the Jews. The Jews have no right, the Jews was second, even not the second citizen. They couldn't work. They couldn't have absolute nothing. So we know already there is trouble."

And this was a very, very badly because we was in Warsaw and I remember it was when shrapnel -- you know what the shrapnel -- it was maybe two, three windows away from our apartment. So in the house if you run down, all my mother she prepare for everybody, pullover, you know, something to put on clothes. So we run to the shelters. So after maybe one or two hours later we go out. We went back to the apartment and we eat what we have. We don't have much but we eat everything. And just the second day, I think, they started again and it was fire bombs that fell in the house where we was living and everything was burned. And we don't have time to take nothing, nothing, we run out just what we have on our back. And everybody -- all these houses, all of Warsaw was burning. So we have nowhere to go. That's what I remember and it was on the same street it was a bath -- public bath. So we went there. We have a little. We took a little broom and my mother she was living, sleeping in the bath tub. That's what I remember. And when the Germans come in, the first thing what they do they start to give food for the peoples, soup and bread. So it was not bad. But after they doesn\u2019t \u2014 they start with the Jews. No Jew have right to have bread. No Jew have nothing. And sometimes my mother- she was blond, she wasn't very dark and so it was not so easy to recognize her like a Jew, so she went and have bread. But sometimes, next day or two days later when she go again, some Polack recognize her and they say, \u201cAh there\u2019s a Jew, there is a Jew.\u201d And they throw her out so we didn't have nothing."

But it was, there was a distance between the Jewish people and the Polish people because the German they start already -- the Jew. They take away everything from the Jews and they start to talk about the ghetto and they start, you know, every Jew have to have, you know, the Jew shtern\u2019\u00ae.

The antisemitic by the Polish people -- by the Polish woman there was already inject in the breast of from the woman and they give it to the children. But the children took the breast from their mothers and start to give them the milk. They give them the hateness for the Jews. And it was all over, all over, every time you have always, you know. There was terrible. Even sometimes you know this day I remember I stay up about two, three o'clock in the night to make a line to have a piece of bread.

We have a piano and we have lessons every day you could. They teach us to play mandolin if you want to or the piano. They teach us Hebrew always when you want to. Nobody force you to do something. And you know, they have all kind of -- wintertime, we went out and we play with winter things and we have, we can go ice skating too. So it was very, very nice, very pleasant.

When the German come in, so the owner from this company they give it over to peoples. I think they was swear in or something like that, and they go in. And when they swear and they go in, every Jew have to go out. We \u2014 I was laid off from there.

So when the all the people, all the children going back to Warsaw because they think the school going to start.

This was maybe '36 or '37, I don't remember exactly, and the plan was to take all the orphanages, all the children to Israel. But no time. And after, when I was there, you know, when the German come into Warsaw, they make a ghetto. How we come in it, I don't know. There I was in kolonia but I know it was very, very big problem. My brothers, my sisters, my mother, she doesn't have food, she doesn\u2019t \u2014 nothing to eat absolute nothing. So when they make the ghetto in the camp. So I know a man, he was a butcher. So he come to me and say, \u201cYou know what, if you want to make some money, you can earn some money. Like you have a face nobody can say you a Jew. You take meat. You go to the ghetto. You sell the meat. I give you the address, everything and you have some money. You help me, you help yourself. You can help your family.\u201d So at certain time every day in the morning, about five o'clock in the morning when the first streetcar pass -- because in the ghetto, Warsaw ghetto, it was a streetcar passing by the ghetto, but nobody can go down. It pass just the ghetto and it was from one Christian side to the other. Nobody can see go in, because there was police there and they take care.

As I say, \u201cStop, is enough, you have to run away from here.\u201d So I go away and, you know, it was about 70 kilometers.

And I sit on the wagon and they bring me to a little point because they turn and I have to go straight and I go straight. And I go to the farm and I ask, \u201cMaybe you have place to sleep?\u201d So it's an old farm. They say, \u201cLook, I have one place but here you can sleep -- there is a lady laying in bed -- 1f you want.\u201d So the lady in one side and I was on the other side. The whole night I eat this bread. The next day, in the morning, I say, \u201coff.\u201d I go to the town and I was in the family. But in certain time the peoples from this town, they need papers. I don't have no papers and the paper was, you know, the fingerprint and this one is the Bloody Sunday. The Gestapo come in, 1n this town and they throw out -- everybody have to go out, and they start to control the papers. I don't have no papers. My brother doesn't have papers.

And at this time I was already an old prisoner so I know the rules. So I don't want to work. It's too hard and I think sometimes in my mind I say myself, \u201cThe world have to finish once. Maybe, we going to be free or maybe we going to be dead.\u201d So I say, \u201cI have to try to survive long as I can so I try not to work too much.\u201d And I become in a Kommando\u201d\u2019. A Kommando, that mean every prisoner was to the Kommando, and Kommando does what kind of work? Some people was electricians, painters, was builders, was carpenters and I was younger this time, so I don't have no trade. So I have a Kapo\u201d\u2019, you know, the Kapo. That mean it was he organize, not organize but he take care on a certain group of people for the work, like a manager for work. So I ask him, \u201cMaybe you want to take me to your job,\u201d because it was not so hard. ** eastern worker (German); forced laborer from Eastern Europe. *\u00b0 Voluntarily (German) \u00b0\u00b0 In a later conversation the interviewee clarified that he had meant to say \u201cPW.\u201d \u00b07 commando (German) *$ Forman (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor Kommando of prisoners. So I was a Kommando 120 \u2014 800 \u2014 28. I was electric Kommando specialist, you know, the work was already little bit easy. First off all, I don't have to carry nothing but, you know, sometimes we have a pliers. Sometimes, you have a case and box with tools or little wire or little cable, and even when we have to pull cables there was a special Kommando, Kommando nine and they pull the cables, and there was that Kommando. There the peoples not survive no longer than four, five weeks."

            "answer": "Because it was very hard. First, they were big cable and it was hard and they were very big. And the Kapo was very bad man. He was from Austria. But I never want to go. I take care always not to fall in, in this Kommando because that finished. So I in was Kommando 128. It was very -- not easy, but it was easy. And one day the chief of -- the German chief come in and I was working with two Polish guys. They was in concentration camp too. But they was okay. So I was the helper. I have to help them. I was carry tools. I was carry the box and they was my chiefs, my managers. So the chief come in and say \u201cLook, you have to go in this, this place, you have to connect the cable to 4000 volt.\u201d I remember very good. So it was in, Tadek and we have to go there. And it was a big cable and there was a box, you know, for the fuses and it was the long fuse. And on the top there was power and on the end there was no power, because you have to put the fuse and you have to connect this cable. So we put the cable in this box and he say, \u201cYou know, what? I'm going to push him. You push in and you make the screws and we\u2019ll be okay.\u201d And so, he was stronger for me, and after the cable I screw a little bit. Not so much because I was not so strong like him. So he say, \u201cYou know what? Now, you come lift little bit the cable. I\u2019m going to screw.\u201d So I have -- the box was big -- I have my face always in the box and I keep this cable. And he took a key, a metal key and turned the nuts, you know, to close it very fast. And in the middle it turned and placed from down to up and from up to down, and it make a short and there was a flame and I have it all, everything in my face. The whole face was burned and he have, you know, split his hand and I think I was burning, so I wipe up and I take out all this meat, all the skin to the bones. It was, first of all, it was hell. So I look at him. So I say, \u201cTell me, what you do?\u201d When he saw me he say, \u201cWe have to go some place.\u201d So we run to the commanders place where the SS was there and we arrive there. So, I remember the SS, they say, \u201cWas hast du -- Icek, was hast du gemacht?\u201d\u2019\u2019 What you are doing? So I say I was in -- meantime there was no power in the center there. So, they call to the -- we have in Krankenbau\u201d\u2019 and like a little hospital, *\u00b0 \u201cWhat have you \u2014 Icek, what have you done?\u201d (German) \u201d Infirmery (German) and they say for me, \u201cHe was wounded -- he was burned. You have to come and take him.\u201d Because I can't see any more, nothing. So -- but the SS still, they give me cigarette, maybe they have pity for me, I don't know. And it is coming with the table. Put me on a table I went to the hospital and I was there. So I say -- it was a doctor, it was Polack -- I say \u201cLook, I hope I can go out tomorrow, day after tomorrow.\u201d So he say, \u201cYou crazy? Even in 15 days, you can't go out.\u201d And, you know, every day the doctor come and take out the dry skin. But I was so bad burned so they have to put me some place because Mengele come in every time to looking after, and when he find me, he send me to the gas chamber because I was very sick. So they hide me at certain time. I was covered with all kind of things -- he doesn't see me. And I was in the hospital for maybe six weeks. After six weeks I come out and we start to work again.

And in this town it was a mountain, a little mountain and they make a tunnel -- you know what a tunnel is -- in case the fliers come in to bomb. And so the people from this town can go in and to be safe, but it doesn't make it right through. And the chief say, \u201cOkay, we going to put the prisoners over there.\u201d They put us there and it was not so very high and so it was cold. Everybody go on the end but it was closed. You couldn't go nowhere because it was not finished, it was not finished. The compress us. All the things was outside, so I went there too, and it was a little warm but after I say, \u201cIs little bit but no air. I want to go in the front.\u201d And they wanting the chief, the commandant in this camp. They make soup, you know, liquid soup. So I have it was a part with me, and I say I going to go in the front every time and I going to take a little bit. I have to eat, so I take one and I say I going to take one, and I have a nice time. In meantime we start to missing air in the end, no air, no air, and everybody want to go in the front. So like here, you have the door. When you open the door, it was a place -- \u201cThis one for me -- a good place, I gonna go there, I go to hide there. Nobody going to see me and I have the fresh air.\u201d And the front was two SS and every time when the peoples want to go to the front, they shoot them. They kill them and they kill lots of peoples. And they put in -- there was a wagon outside and they put a wagon in front so nobody can go in. What I going to tell you? I can't describe it. There was screaming and crying and the peoples, they running to the walls. They licked the walls because it was wet from the no air, and you see the oxide coming out. It was there in March. It was about six o'clock. It was dark and the front was the SS. They let nobody out. We have to stay inside until the next day in the morning, and the morning was lights come in, maybe eight o'clock and they called all the SS to come in, and they let out the people that was still alive, and the firework was coming. They couldn't go in. They had to take the gas mask, they couldn\u2019t go in the end and from the end they took out peoples there. Dead. Maybe 100, 150 people was dead. And some peoples could survive on the end, coming out after five, six minutes they outside, they fell down and die because the lungs, they couldn't support. And I was there maybe couple days, and they took the dead peoples put between the barracks outside, they all frozen. Food, no question about food for us there. And about eight days later we have to go away. And we start again to walk, and the order was to shoot the people, to kill us. But they couldn't kill us in town because it civil people there and they couldn't -- they doesn't want to give us to deliver to the Russian, because the Russians coming from the other side. And they don't want to give us to the American soldier, but the American was too far. So we was between and we was walking every day. Every day we was walking. It was a couple SS and they pull out peoples and they shoot. So I say, \u201cGod, something happen. I won't survive.\u201d So I have -- on my side it was a little SS. He was -- I don't know if he was from Yugoslavia, an older man, maybe 60, maybe more, and he have on backsack. So I say to him, \u201cLook, you not a young man. You know what? Give me your back. I going to carry them.\u201d So he say, \u201cWhy you want to do that?\u201d \u201cI want to help you. You tired. I want to help you. I think that's good.\u201d So he take out -- he give me the thing he was walking just on the side from me. So every time they eat, they have food, they have bread, so he give me just a piece of bread for me. It was good and I can walk, first of all. Second, I was sure no SS going to come and grab me to kill me because I have his things, and he going to take care of it because he want already \u2014 I have \u2014 SS they want to come in and grab me he say, \u201cUh-oh, don't touch it\u2019s mine.\u201d So I was already okay, and when I was doing that so many peoples, not many have prisoners like me to do that. There was about five, six that we carried the SS sack. And in summertime, so we find a wagon. We put all these goods from the Germans, from the SS, on the wagon, and we was pushing the wagon. And we was okay. We didn't have food, but at least I was sure -- I was not sure -- but I was sure I was going to live until night. I don't know what going to be next day. So they put us in all kind of place to sleep, and in the morning we see one dead on one side, one dead on other side \u2014 the people dying like nothing. And it coming May 9, 1945 about seven, eight o'clock in the morning, and it was not far from Friedland in Sudetenland. There was still a little SS come into me and took me by the arm. He say to me in German, \u201cGo hin\u2019\u2019, where you wollt\u201d\u2019, aber lasst euch ja nicht erwischen bei unsere Briider.\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201cGo where you want, but take care the Germans doesn't catch you.\u201d And this was my liberation. The Russian come in there and this was May 1945, and I was with my friend from Holland. My friend and we was running, running, and we saw already, you know, the Germans was sitting the rifles and all these things, all on the side. No more. And one moment everybody who running -- the Germans was running, all the soldiers was running. So I was on the highway and I stay and I wasn't German, and I say, \u201cHey, why you running so fast?\u201d So he say, \u201cFast, fast, Ivan come!\u201d And the Russian coming, this was the liberation. He was lucky he was the first officer that I saw. It was a Jew, Russian, Jew, Russian, and this when was the liberation. So you can imagine."

But before that we have was maybe, you know, Namur. Namur was a priest, a very, very good man, a very fine man, and have trouble with the police because they doesn't want to let us be there. So the gendarmes, the Belgium gendarmes they want to take out to pass the border. So they took one, they put on the truck, and time they want to take someone else. They escaped. It was the priest. He say, \u201cStop. I going to take all.\u201d So he took all the peoples in the church. Jewish people went all there until a Jewish chaplain from the American Army, he know about that, and he took the \u2014 all this people, Brux-- Linkebeek. And it was a home there. It was in Linkebeek in this home, and we was support by the Jewish committee until a certain time. After they liquidate this home and everybody have to go to work, but we have some trouble with the work and we need an carte d\u2019identit\u00e9>\u2019, a card. Some people have a white card, some people have an Model \u201cC\u201d this one with \u00bb* identity card (French) just use fingerprints. And we have trouble to stay there.

He work there.\u201d So I make all my possible. He was a guy, he was Erwin, called him -- he was an Altreich\u201d\u201d Jew. He was an Rapport-Schreiber\u00ae\u2019. He was working in the office with the German for the worker. If somebody change the commander or somebody go from one block -- the first thing, I was in block four. After they send me to block 14. After from block 14 they send me to block 51. And this was the, like I say, an accountant. And they make all the paperwork. So I was talking with him, and I tell him -- I beg him, \u201cLook, I have my brother. He was working there and there and maybe you can do something. Maybe try.\u201d \u00b0\u00b0 Old empire (German); term used for regions within Germany\u2019s pre-1938 borders. \u00b0! Report writer (German) So he promised me. I say, \u201cMy brother\u2019s a barber. He, you know, he going to shave you.\u201d I promise all kind of thing, so he say \u201cI going to try to do that.\u201d So he so that, So he make him like an electrician, special electrician, special. So, I think it was end of 1943. My brother come to my camp in Buna camp. I was in Buna and he was the same electrician. I was electrician. He was electrician, so you can imagine what kind of electrician we was there. So these people they told us everything that happened there, like some people coming from Birkenau, they took every time to put is called a Sonderkommando\u201d. That mean, I don't remember exactly how many, but these people, they took out when the people was gassed dead in the gas chamber. They took out these people, put them on the wagon and push them to the oven. But these people don't do long time because -- I'm sorry -- they put out the dead peoples and they put on the wagon. And most of them, they put two men and one women because the women, they burn faster and better for men. And they put them off a little wagon and they push them in the oven to be burned. And these people doesn\u2019t work long. Maybe after two weeks, they are gassed, killed, because they don't want nobody to have to live. Can't tell nobody what happened, so they kill them. And we know that. Then they have special peoples. They was very good traitor. They received very good food, but eight days later, two weeks later, they have to go, and they took somebody else. And we know that. Exactly the same thing. They took the Russian prisoners, the women prisoners. They took out the marrow from the bones to put to inject the German soldiers. We know that. The experiments, because something the doctors tell us the same thing."

And once when my brother come in camp, you know, from Jawischowitz into my camp -- he was a muselman\u201d. He was very skinny, and so I try to help him. So he was working for the Kommando, for the Luftgaukommando\u2122 -- that mean they make the graves and the holes in the special machine guns against the planes, and they receive very good food, the Germans -- but he was in the commander and they have a couple men with him. And the Germans received this food. But always in the cans they leave a little bit of soup and before these cans have to go back to the camp they have to be washed. So they give him, they say, \u201cHey, you, you come here. Take the soup but wash the cans.\u201d But the cans was washed with iron brushes, and he was always hungry, he doesn't see -- so ate the soup and he swallowed a piece of wire. One Sunday he come to me and he say he was -- it was after, so you have to be a barber and so he shave this guy and somebody else and he say, \u201cT have such a pains in my stomach. I don't know what happened. I have lots of pains.\u201d So I say, \u201cYou know what, come, I go with you to the hospital.\u201d But I know this chief of the doctors for the hospital. So, I say \u201cStefan\u201d -- he was a Polack -- \u201cStefan, look, my brother have pains. You come see something.\u201d So he put him on a bench like that there. Was many doctors coming in and he was saying appendix. He had such big pains, so they put him at night -- not at night -- to operate him and I was on the other side. I was hiding but I saw everything that happened. So it was Dr. Mengele's, because even between the prisoners, there was some good doctors and they worked in this hospital. And they want to operate him, so they open the belly. In meantime everything was open. There was an alarm, you know, the planes. I don't know if English or Russian planes come in. No lights. He was laying down with open stomach. It just take I don't know, very long but the lights coming back. And the doctors coming back. I was behind. I saw that. I saw Dr. Mengele come into him and say on his shoulder, \u201cJude, when you live now, you going to live long time.\u201d And they operate on him. But they pull out all the intestine together very badly and he have very big trouble today, and they can do absolute nothing. Even when eat a little bit too much, they have to put him to the hospital, they have to take out everything. He was very, very sick. \u00b0\u2019 Muslim (German); camp term used to refer to prisoners who had lost the will to live and were near death. Air defense administration (German)"

If they find something, maybe. I can't say because we don't see this guy anymore. Not just him. Some people, couple peoples, but he was in Holland. I think he was somebody. He was from the army and big man, but was in concentration camp. But why, I don't know. And he was, you know, already in block he was something special. And they took him away. I'm sure they took him away to Auschwitz and the Gestapo, and over there they make some questions and pop -- that's it! Because I know in Auschwitz it was in block 14, block 14 was, and in that block everybody would have to \u2014 be shot. They took him to the block 14, and from block 14 was finished. Nobody can go out. Because by us in Buna, they doesn\u2019t shot -- they shot, sure -- but no somebody wasn't tried to the Gestapo. Maybe tried to hang.

There was all the Gestapo and they marking down what kind of trade you have. What you can do? So there was a guy -- he's already dead a long time -- he said -- Chaim Komslowski -- and he come to me, he say, \u201cLook, I can't understand why you are here.\u201d I say, \u201cWhy I here? The same thing why you are here -- I'm a Jew.\u201d But he say, \u201cBut nobody can say you are a Jew.\u201d But the first thing he say, \u201cLook, if you are -- I give you a little advice -- if you want to live, try to avoid any beating. Try to avoid not to drink water, and if they going to ask you what you can do, what kind of trade you have, you say you are a carpenter.\u201d I never was a carpenter in my life. I was 14 years. How could I be carpenter? So it coming my time, you know, to go before Gestapo, and, \u201cYour number, name?\u201d \u201cNo name,\u201d I say, \u201c79630.\u201d \u201cWhat is your trade?\u201d So I say, \u201cI'm a carpenter\u201d so the Gestapo, the Gestapo say, \u201cWhat? What? You are a carpenter? You so young. You\u2019re a carpenter?\u201d I say, \u201cI'm sorry. I was learning carpenter.\u201d So they put me with the carpenters. It was good, but I have a couple Polack, the son of a bitch -- I'm sorry -- some murderer. So I go to the, you know, to the barrack to work things like a carpenter, and they give me a stick and they say, you make a broom. I don't know how to do that. I never saw a carpenter, like, you know, how to make it round. I don't know how. So, nobody want to show me because they were scared and this bitch come in and he say, \u201cYou not a carpenter. You\u201d -- and they start to hit me, to kick me, to hit me. There was -- an SS was sitting there. So he come in and ask him, \u201cHey, why do you hit him?\u201d So he say, \u201cBecause he was lying. He is not a carpenter.\u201d So he tell him, \u201cYou let him go.\u201d So he called me and he say, \u201cHere, you have the cans, you are going to wash the cans. You can clean the toilet.\u201d And this was my luck. So times like I say you have some Germans that was.... Conclusion of interview."
