Then I had a bad conscience or how shou -- bad feeling something might happen, because we were supposed to meet. Then on September 19, on that farm where I was working, their name was Prosmueller, that was on either side of Linz between Linz and Vienna, just a -- oh, about four or five kilometer from the very well known concentration camp Mauthausen. And that day, on that day, that was again Friday. Friday is a bad day for me. Was, at least. And we was -- before noon we was digging potatoes there on that farm, and I was working with that -- with the horses, yeah, and we come for lunch, and as we was eating lunch, from the -- the other side of the kitchen, somebody walk in, see? Then we hear the conversation. And what I hear, oh he\u2019s very good, he\u2019s very hard working, yeah, he 1s nice man, oh, yes, yes. That\u2019s what they say. And that was a policeman. So after he questioned -- because the -- the -- the farmer, and the -- and the parents, they was eating in the kitchen, we was eating in the dining room, see? Then, after awhile, we just almost finished lunch, and that policeman come to the dining room and says, Julius Noga, I have to bring you to the Gestapo, to the Linz. He says, I have to bring you to the Linz. I says, Gestapo? He says yes. When I hear that word Gestapo, I know -- I already knew it 1s Gestapo. I says, oh God. Good-bye. He says, okay, you change your clothes, take 66 19 whatever you need like toothbrush and soap, when you had, whatever, you know, take it with you, and you come with me. So we go on a station, regular station and we take the train. That was only 16 kilometer to Linz. So what was very hard for me to say good-bye to this wonderful family, you know? They took me as their own. They had two children, a little girl, Minnie, she was about eight years old, and Francel, he was about 10 - 11 years old. And the children was there, and he ask me, \u201cJulian, where you going?\u201d I says, \u201cWell I have to go on Linz.\u201d \u201cWhat for?\u201d I says, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cAre you be back?\u201d I says, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cOh, come on, Julian,\u201d you know? Break my heart, cause those children were so nice. And the farmer come and says, \u201cJulian, you have to go. Gosh, what did you do?\u201d I says, \u201c\u201cN-Not much.\u201d \u201cWell, I gonna help you all I can, okay?\u201d So the policeman was good to me, I says well, okay, ha -- I gotta finish with my horses, see, I take care of the horses, I gotta give them water, I gotta give them some hay, you know? He says, go ahead, do it, yeah, okay, we got time. So I say good-bye to my horses. Such a big, beautiful, shiny horses, oh my gosh. That was a break -- a heartbreak. And there was a French war prisoner Louie, and I want to talk to Louie because I know he gonna take care of the horses, so I told Louie, Louie -- he understand pretty good German, I says, take care of those horses, they are very nice horses, you know? Don\u2019t beat them, never beat them, you know. Treat them good, work with them slow, don\u2019t rush them, you know. Take care of them. He says, I will, I will. So I say good-bye to horses and to everybody, so we go. Policeman had a -- a bicycle, so we walked to the station just a kilometer and a half, two kilom -- not even two kilometers. Then we were ou -- then he 66 20 come to the ma -- where they sell the tickets, and there was a man, and -- yeah. And for that man, each morning he had a -- yeah, each morning I bring some milk, see? He was the -- he was the regular old man, you know, high ranking, and -- and he said -- the police ask him question because that was forbidden for Polish people to ride the tran -- train. So he asked, did you sell any tickets to this man here? And I was behind that policeman, and he look at me, and I -- I just make a motion no. And he says, no, I never sell him no tickets. Oh, good. So he put a [indecipherable] the tickets, or how many times he sell me the tickets, but he was a very nice man. His name was Schattsinger. Okay, so the train come, and I was standing there, and I was thinking, my gosh, you know, should I fall on the track, you know, and let the train go over me, you know, because I know this time it\u2019s going to be tough, and I know what I gonna get it."

Thanks. Where you live?\u201d Oh, here in Arizona, I retired, so and so, and wa -- I was in a 97 division of Third Army, General George Patton. So this gonna be 50 anniversary and I\u2019m in contact with the Munich government there, with the minister, and I got invitation and probably you gonna get invitation too. And we should go, and we should meet there. I says, okay, we go. Yeah, then I go with the whole family. But before, I says, I want to do something. Then I call Bob, and I told him over the telephone what I want to do. Some kind of mark, like a bronze plaque, to thank Third Army for liberation. He says, yes, that\u2019s a good idea. I gonna call up Munich and I gonna tell them, you know, and they gonna find a place where they want to put that -- that plaque. Good, good idea. So he called me back, he says, yes I already -- I already talked to minister so and so in Munich. I says, good idea, and that plaque what Julian Noga gonna design, we can put it in death valley on a wall. There is a wall there between the chapel and -- and death valley, and he can put it there. And when he -- when he make this plaque, I give him the help, and they help him, you Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 66 51 know, to -- to place that plaque there. Okay. So I design that plaque. I put pretty good size, oh I don\u2019t know, 28 inches by 18 inches high bronze plaque. And then I put in the left corner on top, I put American Sherman tank. Then in right corner on top I put that emblem, the -- from that 97 division emblem they had, there is like a fork, like a devil fork or something like that, you know? That was the emblem for the division. So I put that emblem in the right corner on top and then I say, well, thanks to the American, you know, for liberation this and this, then I put Julian Noga, number 1623, and other prisoners, to thank Americans, see? So when we -- when I -- when I bring that plaque over there, I had two workers there, what they take care of that place, and they had the drill, and they, you know, we already told them, you know, how this gonna be put in the wall, in the granite wall. And they drill up the -- for me, four holes, you know, and I set that plaque myself with my own hand there.

            "answer": "Yes, well this 1s -- I got my own explanation for myself, see? That was a wartime, and gosh in a wartime, many, man -- this no -- no war, you know, is honest on either side, you know. And during the wartime so many people had it worse, maybe worse than -- than -- than -- than me, you know, like take any Jewish family, you know, like I meet -- even the Dr. Terry, you know, he losted a whole family there, he is by himself. And many other Jewish people, you know, they losted their whole family, you know? And also some Polish people losted their family in a concentration camp, and -- and was -- you know, there could be a worse, you know, but maybe of this experience I explain myself, what we was going through, maybe make a -- maybe this experience make me a better man, you know, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so busy, you know, with this social organization, you know, and I try help other people. And I try tell the people that life can be a different, you 66 54 know. And, you know, it bothers me when I see that the American, you know, make a demonstration, and sometime they burn the American flag, you know, that hurts. I -- I say, people, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. You don\u2019t know that the life can be a different. And matter of fact, you know, if I was young boy when the older people says, you know, what they was going through the first World War, I laugh and I says, ah what - they say they eat rotten potatoes, you know and this and this. My gosh, it\u2019s happen, I no have to wait long enough and I eat rotten potatoes. I -- and this is hard to believe, why rotten potatoes? I tell you why. When a potatoes is rotten, you cut the bad -- bad part out of it, and rest of it 1s little bit yellish -- brownish, you know? Rotten potatoes is sweeter, and healthy potatoes is bitter, that\u2019s why. So I remember what the older people says, we used -- then we was so hungry we eat the rotten potatoes. Yes, I understand, now, see? So- but when a -- when it comes -- you know, at that time, I didn\u2019t pay my -- m-much attention, you know, oh gosh, there was a first World War. So what? So what? They was born in wrong time, you know, I was born after the war, you know, I\u2019m lucky. But by gosh I not have to wait too long -- too long, you know, to go maybe even worse what they was going through. See, then I find out -- that\u2019s why, you know, that experience, that life what we had, maybe make a be -- better man out of me, you know? Maybe I appreciate it more, what we had, you know, the life, the freedom, you know. What is really important."

Some of them was in the concentration camp, but most of them, you know, they was working in the -- on the farms, like I was working on a farm first, and in the factories, you know? Then we -- well, we come to this country like I told you from the beginning you know, e-everything was strange over here, was beautiful but strange. So we organize ourselves, and I was one of the co-organizer 1-in this organization. We named that organization the newcomer\u2019s organization, see? So we started making shows, you know, and whatever money we had, we have some orphans in Germany, some widows, you know, the money was going, you know? There was like a charity organization. And thanks God, you know, I was 35 years president of this organization. Then I organized another organization what is Kopernik Memory Association. So my idea was to have another organization with the Polish background, you know, to tell us about the Polish history, you know, Polish culture. And same time we collect enough money, you know, on 45,000 dollars, and we build up the beautiful statue here in Utica. That was my idea, I must say, Kopernik statue, 21 feet high and stays right in the center of the city of Utica, across the street from the Munson Proctor Ins -- Institute -- museum, see. And I\u2019m very proud about that, and we had other people, you know, I like.

            "question": "Did you keep up a little bit with the discussion about Jewish-Polish relationships in Poland in the 70\u2019s, and then in the later 80\u2019s this become a -- a difficult discussion to -- in Poland, to di -- to discuss that more openly than it was before. Did you keep up with that a little bit? Do you think it\u2019s -- the -- the process of working through this very difficult subject matter is -- is happening?",
            "answer": "This is a -- a very delicate question, you know. I grow up with the Jewish people, as I told you from the beginning, you know. Matter of fact, I had the Jewish girl, we was very close with the -- nothing was there, not -- we was not in love, no, absolutely. But we grow up together and thanks God, you know, she survive, you know. She had the Christian paper, she emigrate to Germany. She was working on a farm in Germany, as a Polish girl and she married a Polish guy, you know, and her father was killed, and -- during the war, and her mother was killed, too, you know, and she was the only one there, you know. So we grow up with the Jewish people and I had nothing against the Jewish people there in -- in -- in Poland, absolutely, you know. That was a -- more like a tradition, you know, if you want to buy something you go in a Jewish store, you know, you buy, you know, you get good deal, you know? But -- and Jewish people in Poland, I 66 37 think there was about three and a half -- three and a half million Jewish people in Poland, you know. There was more Jewish people in Poland that time than today in Israel, see? And -- and they had businesses, they had heavy industry that was in Jewish hand, too, and I think they was treating, you know, very well, they -- we had doctor and -- doctors and professors and scientists and all kind of -- you know, and that was -- that was -- I think they was treating good. But here, after years, time to time, I see some articles in the paper that -- that we aren\u2019t -- that we are, Polish people, anti-Semitic. Now, this is, to me, a little bit hurts me this, this accusation. Because I wasn\u2019t anti-Semitic. I live -- I had a friend, Jewish friend, and I still got Jewish friend here. Jake Terry is a example. I have here in Utica many Jewish people are good friends, close friends. And that hurts sometime when they accuse us, you know, to -- that the Polish people are anti-Semitic, yeah. Well, gosh, you know, I don\u2019t know what they mean. Well, this happened -- see, our -- somebody, you know, another Christian make a denunciation on me, you know, about the [indecipherable] what I tell you about, you know? How about Frieda, you know, some people make a denunciation. So you got bad people here, here, and I believe, you know, maybe that was some anti-Semitic, you know, in -- in Poland between some kind of people, you know, not -- not me, you know. And when you say the Polish people, then you talk about all Polish people, that I\u2019m included, ex -- as a -- as a -- a -- froma Polish background, you know? And we -- I think we shouldn\u2019t say that, that -- you know. I believe that some people was anti-Semitic and maybe today you -- you -- you\u2019Il find them, see? Like you find here in this country, anti-American people, right? Yeah? When I listen to -- to Rush Limbaugh, you know, I wonder -- I wonder, you know, what kind of an American he is, you know, when he called our president stupid, and a liar and this and this, call him name, you know? That\u2019s for me -- that hurts me, too, you know? I mean, this 1s a very delicate -- delicate question, you know, between the Christian and Jewish people in Poland. But I think that Poland opened the border for seven century, when the other countries, you know, chase out the Jewish, you know, like Spain or other countries chase out the Jewish people, Poland take them, you know, and for seven century, the Jewish people was in Poland. And my gosh, you know, maybe there was some incidents, you know, I don\u2019t know about that, see? But as I remember, you know, like y-you take a - even little city like Struchin or Tarnow. My gosh, the -- most of the population was Jewish population and the businesses, most of them was in Jewish hands. So that was, I think, I don\u2019t know if you -- if you say criticize, this is -- I-I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t got no answer, you know."

The Polish community make a special banquet for us, we had about 250 people, and many congratulation and there was a high official from the county, from the city, and congratulate us. And that was very interesting to us, we turn a little bit back, you know, to accept a invitation from United States Holocaust in Washington, D.C..

Matter of fact, I was sitting next to him, and I show him my indentity card from American Holocaust, you know, United States Holocaust, and he was very interested. And then I had a interview with him after, and also I put on my radio program. That interview was very interesting. Now, Polish American congress have lobby in Washington, D.C., and Polish American congress was working hard so that -- 66 81 that Poland become a mem -- member of NATO organization.

Oh, he didn\u2019t know what to say. He says, yeah but anyway, how come Holland save percentage-wise more Jewish people than Poland? Then this Steve, the Jewish fellow, he says, well, percentage, that was a different situation and there is a difference between Holland and Poland. See, in Poland that was -- before the war started, that was three and a half million Jewish people living. Okay, Poland is Christian country. The German know that. And the German expect that Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 66 83 the Polish people gonna help Jewish people. And that\u2019s why they set that law, for anything to do with the Jewish people, Polish Christian help Jewish people or hiding Jewish people, death sentence. And that was the -- the poster was all over the city, you know, in Polish and in German, you know, and that was clear, you know, what you\u2019re going to get. But even so, this Steve -- this is not my words, this Steve told that professor from Schenectady, New York, even so, the Polish people save about 100,000 Jewish people. Yeah. And different -- different ways, see, some churches, you know, help lots, you know. The nuns, and also there was like Professor Karski. Professor Karski, who knows how many indentity card he give to the Jewish people as a Christian. And those people survived. So I think that was a good answer to this. I\u2019m sorry to say, you know, that the Jewish people maybe feel bitter against the Polish people, that the Polish people make -- didn\u2019t make enough, you know? But when you go to Israel, when you look at it, what\u2019s the name that place, you know, where that -- all names are, and they have -- had --"

So, most of the -- those organization was like a insurance, like a ro -- mothers of rosaries, or Saint Anne Societies, and Saint Peter Societies, you know.

Tell us about the culture, Polish culture, American culture, you know? So that was a -- at that time, 1970 some -- yeah, that -- \u201973, I think. That was a -- a fi -- fifth anniversary -- 500 anniversary of Nicholas Kopernicus -- Nikolai Kopernik birthday. And then I called special meeting, the whole Polonia meeting, and it -- oh, about hundred people attend, presidents, you know, from different organization, you know, guests. And I introduce my plan, you know, we -- we need another organization. And because this 1s a 500 anniversary of Nicholas Kopernicus, Nikolai Kopernik birthday, maybe we should build up a statue, put the statue here in the city [indecipherable] to this -- make a mark, you know, to this, because who was Nikolai Kopernik? Nikolai Kopernik was the astronomer, and he was the first man find out that the -- not the sun but the earth turns around the sun, right? Yeah, and that -- that came long time til his book and theory was accepted, but finally was accepted, and by gosh, truth is, we can send a man on the moon, do you know, and this and this, you know, that [indecipherable]. And so the people agree to -- to do this, and wa -- coming back to Nicholas Kopernik -- Ko-Kopernicus, he is a universal man. And I think that -- that time I thought -- I thought that was worth [indecipherable] to build up the statue for him. And we did. I designed the pedestal, because I am stonecutter, of course, and the statue was made -- three and a half meter high, was made in Warsaw, in Poland. Bronze statue, made out of bronze. So we put it together, and -- that statue, with the pedestal base, 1s 21 feet tall and four inches, exactly. And then -- then we had unveiling. When the statue was ready we had unveiling and many, many people come. And the congressman make a -- a -- recorded it in Washington, D.C. in Congress, that such a thing happen in 66 91 Utica, New York. And that was a big -- big, big thing. So -- and the organization, Kopernik organization, right after that decided to give a -- help students in college, you know, give a grant, you know, give a scholarship. And that\u2019s what they do since that, up to today, you know, they do -- not big sc-scholarship, you -- like thousand dollars for three s -- for three students, each become thousand dollars -- get a thousand dollars, yeah.
