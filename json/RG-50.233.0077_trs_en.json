They took him to a concentration camp and I, the secretary, Jewish secretary whom they didn\u2122t know, stayed there. So that was a rather almost humorous asp ect of that case. So I stayed there for a couple of months without him. When things got to be very dangerous, then I knew the safe number of that lawyer. That was right before things got very serious already. Then I opened up the safe and took out his -- the lawyer\u2122s daughter\u2122s pa pers, knowing if I have to run away, I will run away with this papers which I did.

            "answer": "Well, that -- first of all, I have to tell you that we were -- my father and mother were Polish origin. In 1941, when the Germans were not occupying Hungary yet, they came out -- they give the order to the Hungarians to deport all the non-Hungarian citizens. My father in spite of that, that he was as a Hungarian officer in the Hungarian army and he had the Iron Cross and all that things, when the order came out to deport -- you know there was a time in Hungary and when all the non-Hungarian were deported from Hungary and fr om Budapest. Unfortunately, we were among them and unfortunately we were among them the very first thing when that deportation started, when we didn\u2122t know yet wh at\u2122s going on. They came to our house and they said, pack your bag, we will take you to your own country. You will work there and you will survive after the war. That was in June, 1941. They came to our house and they said well pack your bag and go. How do you pack your bag when you live there a lifetime? So we cried and my mother cried and I cried and my fianc\u00e9 was there. So the guy, he was new on the job and he had a certain human car ing and sympathy to us said, you know what, I will take your father so I\u2122m sure you stay here. You have one day to pack your bag and do whatever you want. That\u2122s what he did. In that one day, I had a choice and some people, some relatives told me, you are young, go and hide before they take you. But my father wrote a letter that the family has to stay together. Please come and whatever will be, we will survive it together. So we packed our bag and we went outside. We lived in a house, four floors. All the tenants were looking and saying goodbye to us. Some of them cheering, some of them jeering. That\u2122s how we were deported to Poland at that time. I sa y deported to Poland which is again easy to say but how we were and what happened and how we went there and how we walked or whatever happened. In between a lot of Hungarian, so-called Polish-Hungarian origin got killed in Kamieniec Padolski. That was a famous to wn where they -- you heard about Kamieniec Podolski."

But knowing my parents knew Polish, they all hired a private buggy and we had relatives in Kolomjya. We stayed -- we hid back from the transport because we knew that the transport is going to Kamieniec Padolski. A lot of other people escaped too but we went with that buggy to Kolomyja and that\u2122s where we stayed in Kolomjya, that was that time, yes, more or less normal life because the ghetto was not easy. But of cour se, after a year being in the ghetto and losing people -- it was over 20,000 people in Kolomyja -- by the time I escaped as a smuggler, there was only a couple of hundred left. That\u2122s when it was that I said goodbye to my parents and of course, I never saw them again. I started on the road going back to Hungary which was a bad road to talk about a lot."

We we nt to work in the morning because my father being a military person and the Germans also gave him a job as a supervisor. The other Jews didn\u2122t like him because he was a supervisor. They didn\u2122t like nobody who supervised over other Jews. So we worked there for a time. As a matter of fact, I worked in a kitchen preparing dinner for German officers. My job was -- with three other girls -- peeli ng potatoes. At that time, hunger was already a big aspect of ghetto life because you know that people just died of hunger. So what we did, we got permission for the peels to take home. We had the peels for whatever meals we made."

So we couldn\u2122t do that. From then on, we had to eat the peels and not peel the peels. The other one what I remember from the ghetto, when we went out to work. Through wor k, we got to know some other workers. This was German families who moved into Jewish hous es. They renovated and redecorated a little; we worked on it, to keep it clean until their wi fe and children came. We saw the mementoes of a life, you know Jewish life, sometimes we came into a house where we saw the pots and pans yet as they carried them out. We just had to close our eyes and see what happened there. We had to clean up and make it ready for the German officers. I was working there once washing the floors with a pail, you know a big pail of water. Because you\u2122re asking me to tell you memories from the ghetto."

            "question": "Yes, yes.",
            "answer": "So the German --. Until that time, you know, I knew that I was in danger and everything but I didn\u2122t have any personal contact with any physi cal punishment. Cleaning the floor and almost finished it, he came in and he took the pail and he kicked the pail and he said this is not clean enough, clean it again. So that was my first encoun ter with a German offi cer. As it happened to be, the German officer\u2122s wife came back. She acted rather humanely to the Jewish girls. It happened to be that, I don\u2122t know whether I s hould mention it, but ever ything -- but she had some tendencies for liking girls. The questi on was whether to use this situation to your advantage or not to use it to your advantage. But sometimes, it came to a point, you told me an incident before about bread. Sometimes you came to a point when the only thing on your mind was, you are twenty years old and somewhere al ong in the sky when you looked up, there is a life yet for people. Let\u2122s do whatever is possible but let\u2122s survive. It happens to be that that woman helped me a lot to get easier job, to get more food until her husband came to the picture. Then I lost my job. Then we had to go to a factory where he worked, some kind of, if I remember correctly, I think something with an ironwork or something. The first day when I went there, we were rather abused that time there. Then I decided that this is a good place maybe to run away or something or make connecti ons and that\u2122s what I heard the first time, that there is somewhere a small _____________ that it is possible to --. I stayed in that factory and I worked there. We went out to ghetto, back to the ghetto and the ghetto was always less and less and less. My parents were always less and less independent and more and more relied on me. The roles reversed between parent s and children. Not children because it was only me. It was me who directed them what to do and how -- like for instance, when I had to go to work, this mother, the Germans looked up and mother got old very suddenly in the ghetto. It happened -- it coincided with her menopause too so that was really a hard thing because she acted sometimes very strange. I was very much afraid -- everything fell on her and she just couldn\u2122t digest the tragedy what fell on her. I sometime s was the one who had to lead her and say it will be good. I remember I pinched her cheeks sometimes so she would survive so maybe made a little bit her hair so that the Germans won\u2122t say you are too old to work. This was a couple of memories from the ghetto. Then, of course there was also memories. I met a young man who worked in a soup kitchen. You know when you are twenty years old, no matter what the situation you are thrust into, you always have a little bit romantic state in you. Because that keeps you alive. I met a young man who was very kind to me and he gave me always thick soups and things like that. I sometimes me t him but he had somebody else, I had somebody else but it developed some kind of rapport between us. I remembered him long after that. That was, of course my present husband. But I didn\u2122t know at that time yet. But when it came to the time that the ghetto got from 20,000 to a couple of hundred, I said that\u2122s it. I discussed it with my mother the last day. The last night when I knew that I\u2122m leaving in the morning --. You know we rather stayed away from kissing or touching or something because you changed. In order to survive you have to lose your -- certain feelings disappear from you. But that was the last night and mother just touched me so b ecause she had her own thoughts and I had my own thoughts. The only thing what I re member that I just wanted to -- that nobody should touch me and nobody should kiss me. Just to push it away because one more touch and one more kiss, I\u2122m not going to leave. That was the reason. I never explained it to her but I hope she understood it because one more touch and one more kiss, I\u2122m not going to leave. That was the reason. I never explained it to her but I hope she understood it. Because when she wanted to touch me, I just like -- I pushed it away. I did it in order that I shoul d be able to leave. The next -- before I left my father gave me that talisman which I carry with me. I never, never leave it. Wherever I go, that talisman goes with me. Somehow, I don\u2122t -- I\u2122m not superstitious otherwise, but I truly believed that talisman saved me from a lot of situations. When the time will be that I have to go, then I have to decide which of my children will have it. That was the ghetto and I went away. I went back to Budapest where that time even so that Hitler was far and advancing all over; it was still not the ghetto. Only a couple of months later ---."

But in any case, we were walking at night and sleeping at daytime. That was just about the last day before we saw already, the Hungarian border when somebody proba bly who noticed us, told it to the German guards. They came up this -- we were ten of us who were escaping from the ghetto -- they came up, the German guards and they shot everybody on sight. I ran away that time and it was laying there a big tree eaten up from the moss. Y ou know, hollow inside. There is a lot of fate was in my life what I have to strongly believe that there must be something, somebody, somewhere who prepared that tree for me there, wh ere I went in that tree, in that hollow tree. Was laying and I was laying; I wa s in the tree. I just heard the shooting and the crying and saying no, no; until everything got quiet. I walked out from the tree and what I saw only dead people. I started to walk because I think that time; from that day on I was not quite right. I think I was singing or something. I said, I\u2122m go ing back to mamma and how wonderful it is. I stumbled, by accident, over the smuggler who wa s also escaping, but not only that he was getting -- he was getting shot and escaping and I found him but everybody had a little knapsack, you know, little knapsack where we had things. He, in a big hurry, instead of taking his knapsack, took my knapsack, took my knapsack and I am the one who survived. So this little incident what I sometimes wonder how that work ed out. So I found him but he was injured and he said he cannot do nothing. He gave me his poc ketknife and in his tie, he was --. The trouble as they shot, they shot at my back and it went into his tie, near the genital areas. He gave me that little knife and he said that I have to take that bullet out which I did. He was there for the night and then he said, write me that letter that y ou are here so that I can get my money. I won\u2122t get too much in any case because from the ten of you, you are the only one survived. So that\u2122s what the paper what I showed you that I wrote him and that was from the woods. This was the Hungarian woods in Korosmezo."

So he said that, he covered me over with leaves and he said I don\u2122t feel good. So he left me with my knapsack what I had a little sweater on. It was cold in the woods already. He said -- he gave me an onion, by the way, which was very good. He went aw ay and he said he will come for me. He will whistle a certain way so I know because that was, even so it was in the woods, but people could still go there. He said when you hear that whistle, then tell that this is you. So he went away and he left me there four and a half -- fo ur days and one night. I was in the woods by myself so I was really -- can you imagine that, a twenty- year old girl in the woods, you know, rain or not rain or anything. There was one in cident that something moved, I probably moved and the peasant came there who wa s taking lambs to eat, to rais e or whatever you call it. He heard and he comes straight -- he came straight where I am. I was ju st huddling there covered with certain leaves there and I heard the steps closer and closer . The only thing what he did, he peed and peed on me. I was just standing there a nd that was one of the incidents. Then people asked me what did you eat for four days? Y ou have to eat for four days, which is not necessarily so. But I had that one onion and then blueberries grew that time in the --. When I felt safe enough in the night. I went around me and I ate some blueberries. But the fourth night, I dreamed about my fianc\u00e9 in Hungary at that time. It was a beautiful wedding and everything. When I got up and I was in the si tuation, you know, whatever I was in there; I looked up, I said this is sh_____. I can\u2122t. There was a limit what I could endure. And I said, I just don\u2122t care anymore, nothing, when I heard th e whistle. So little coincidences and he did come. I told him where were you? I couldn\u2122t talk so good to him because he didn\u2122t talk Hungarian and I didn\u2122t talk so good Polish. But he said, he was sick. I mean, I believe it, I\u2122m not such a good surgeon. He came for me the fi fth day and he took me to a place where I had to walk up on the top. Because I was -- even so I was in Hungary -- I think my husband explained it. When they catch you ther e, then they immediately se nd you back to Germany. So everybody was afraid to give -- to hide you. So I was up there in the -- in some kind of an attic waiting for further instruction to go deeper into Hungary. The deeper you got into Hungary, the safer you were that the Germans -- that they won\u2122t give you over to the Germans. This was in 1942. As I was walking down the steps because he told me to come down now we are ready, we have a car and we will go to the next town which is Mag__________. As I walked down, I saw a figure in the bottom of th e steps and I didn\u2122t recognize quite and he probably didn\u2122t recognize me. But when I wrote that letter, you k now, what I gave; my fiance, he himself came all the way to the border town, to bring the car and that was him standing downstairs. I don\u2122t go into the feelings and sentimenta l aspects with you. I leave that to your imagination.. But it was something to behold. His life was, of course, at that time in danger because if they would catch him, he would also be -- so he was a Hungarian citizen. But what I wanted to tell you, what I don\u2122t want to leave out. As we wanted to go to Mar____ to get with the car and from Mar____ again, you\u2122re already out. In Hungary you can go with the trains, cars, buses, whatever you want to. Until that time, you were in danger. It was a long row of car before the bridge. When you passed the bridge, you were already in -- on my destination. There was a long line of cars. At the beginning of the car, the chauffeur looked out , the one that was paid. He said, we are in trouble because they re checking the cars, my first instinct was to jump out because if they see me, the way I look from this life. I was full with lice by the way. My head was full with lice. I was dirty ,I was bleeding. I had wounds, I had all kind of things there from the woods. If they catch him, he will pay with his life for it. So I wa nted to jump out from the car and if that\u2122s the way, it has to be .He was holding me back and a ll suddenly a soldier comes to our car. Mind you, there was a long line of cars there before us, crossing the bridge. He doesn\u2122t even look in the back. It was such a remarkable incident that I will never forget it. He doesn\u2122t look in the back. He just goes to the chauffeur and he says, you know, I lost my key. I can\u2122t even remember what he said -- license or my key or if he said something to the chauffeur -- would you please drive me to Korosmezo. The chauffeur sa id, of course. He came in and sat next to the chauffeur. As we walked by, you know the cars, and as we reached the point where th e guy checked everybody\u2122s card, they just looked in and saw a Hungarian officer. They just saluted and we went by. To this day, number one, I do n\u2122t forget the incident. Number two, I don\u2122t believe in supernatural, I cannot quite believe it but there is a tiny little doubt in my mind whether this was not some kind of an angel set down. Because why would -- I mean it is a coincidence to be mentioned."

I ate potato peels and stuff like that. But as we closed into the year, more and more Germans came to Hungary until finally on the main street of Hungary, the Germans marched in and that was the end. Hungary was occupied by Germany. You know Horthy, Horthy was the ---. So he went away with his white horse and stuff like that. He tried, as a matter of fact, to save the Jews but he was too weak to do a nything in that respect. Then the Germans came in and then, of course, the Germans took over like they took over the other countries. Then came the ghetto.

This was a collective camp \u0152 where they collected people when they had enough. Because they didn\u2122t take just a hundred people, they didn\u2122t take.

The bombs were falling, the dead people were around me but I felt safer there than in the bomb shelter because the more it bombed, the more and more Germans came -- they had nothing better to do. The more and more came to the sh elter and took out people and took them out to the Danube. The Danube was floating with thousands of people. As a matte r of fact , I will tell you, remind me if I forget it, because I have to tell you a very important in cident after the war, after the ___________, remind me from that. So, now what did I tell you before?"

            "answer": "Oh, yes. So January 18, we were liberated by the Russians and January 16, they still came, the Germans looking for Jews. One of them when they came in and I was there in the shelter. I couldn\u2122t walk any more on the street because it was just really 100 % because the bombs were falling like anything. There I made an acquainta nce -- you see -- I must also tell you one other aspect what I don\u2122t like to go into that -- it maybe sometimes embarrassing. But I said after the ghetto, that I came back. I said I ha ve to survive. Standing or la ying but I will survive. Was no morality left in me. Even so I was brought up in a house where, if I wasn\u2122t home by eight o\u2122clock my father was walking before the hous e, you know. There was one guy who said well, I think, I am almost sure that he knew I was Je wish. But he somehow got a liking to me and he said that if I\u2122m nice, he will be nice. I said, I will be as nice as you want me to be. When the guy came to check the -- because they checked th e papers, who is Jewish, who is not Jewish. There was another family there, a woman and her husband and a son. A nice, fat, beautiful looking Jewish boy. She was with papers and I was with papers. Somehow one Jew recognized the other one. Somehow be feeling or by look or by eyes. There was some kind of rapport that one Jew knew what the other Jew. But one aspect of this which is maybe nobody told you, or maybe they did; there was one aspect to it, when one Jew was caught, then they had the tendency unfortunately, if I was caught, then you should be caught too. I don\u2122t go into psychological reasoning but maybe there is a reasoni ng what there is an answer to it. When the German guy, when that Nazi came to check the papers, this other boy was standing beside me. (End of Side A) Oh, yes. In any case, as I said they came this Nazis, the Hungarian Nazi s what they call this the Millerkaras, that was the Hungarian name. They were sometimes more brutal and more perverse than the Germans, if you can be more."

They did not accept their papers and they took them out. Of c ourse, as I told you that time, it was such a big bombardment that they didn\u2122t have time to take th em to the Danube so they shot them all too. Mother, father and son. I found that out later. I didn\u2122t know that th ey were shot right before the house. But that was not the end of the story. As they walked out, they looked at me. I knew that in that moment, in that -- how do you say that in English, there comes a moment of --?"

Or they will say or they will not say that, but in order to save that moment of truth -.. You see everybody had a blanket or a quilt or we called it different from a quilt --. In that moment when they took them out, I thought -- you see at that time I escaped from so many things already that I had a little bit of experience. I was far from that na\u00efve already what I was before. I said to the guy who was standing beside me, I said, look, this people, these Jews. I used the word -- they had a very nice blanket and I don\u2122t have one, can I have it? It startled the guy who checked my papers. Before I even ga ve him my papers, the other guy said, you don\u2122t have to check her out. She will have the new blanket from the Jew and I will check her out. He didn\u2122t even have my papers in his hand. Because my papers was even so I had it with me and they were not. I was a prostitute according to my papers, that kind of papers I had. I certainly acted sometimes accordingly. That\u2122s another story. In any case, they went away and they took them out and they shot them. Now I have to interject here now, a scene. This people whom they shot before the house, she had a brother. After the war, when we were still in that house, the brother came to pick up whatever they ha d. Then they said, I heard that there was somebody here, some shiksa here, who took away my dead brother\u2122s room. They shot before the house, the _______________. I want to confront that woman. I was still, because at that time was still, you know not safe to go out but even so that the Russians took already over, the Germans sometimes came back and forth. So it was not safe yet to give yourself away. I never did it. Some people did it. They gave themselv es away and then the Germans came back, that was the end of them. I never -- I still didn\u2122t b ecause I knew that they come -- Budapest is two part, Buda and Pest -- in Buda was the Germans, in Pest was the Russians. They went back and forth. It took two, three weeks until finally the Russians took over. So he wanted to confront me that who is that who took her -- and to te ll me certain things. When he came there and was confronted me, it was even so that time that the Russians were there already, I was still afraid. I said just don\u2122t make too much commotion. I did that to save my life, I\u2122m Jewish too. We talked there sometimes and he said well, in that case, I understand it. That was the after effect of that case. In any case, we were there in th at shelter all the way until January 18. In the night, one Russian but comes down. You see, I talk a bout the Russians so much because the Russians are the ones who liberated us. Not the Russians, I\u2122m not here."

            "question": "This is 1945 already?",
            "answer": "This is 1945, January 18. So my war last ed from 1941 to 1945. So I was 4 \u00bd years younger wherever. When the first Russians came in and mi nd you, I was still with Catholic papers there. When the first Russians came in somehow, you know, in any case that day\u2122s already with the bombardment, is catching these parents and ever ything. I am quite sure that I was mentally really not right and understandably so. I was really, really on th e end of my line. I couldn\u2122t take too much more anymore. When I saw the firs t Russian, I just -- I said there is other people around. Wherever we were living in the shelter, th at was in the basement, of course. Half of it was bombed and everything. I wanted to run to that Russian and kiss him from top to toe. I\u2122m free, I\u2122m free -- you know, the movies. They were holding me back. They said don\u2122t you know what the Russians are doing? They did a lot of raping, you know that. They didn\u2122t care whether they rape 18 year old or 88 years old, they didn\u2122t care. But the difference it was, that the first fighting group who fights for a city is al ways the elite of the military. They do not do any raping. They are not the ones who does it. The occupying troops are the ones who does it. When all kind when it was free, free robbery, free raping, free --. You could do anything. But the first elite group didn\u2122t do too much raping. But I wanted to go out and then the girl next to me, she said, what are you so happy about? To see the Russians, what you know, she started because she didn\u2122t really know who I am. She ju st knew how my name is just Komaria. He was holding me back and I didn\u2122t go. But the second day, because then they came more and more Russians in the basement looking for men, you know, who was hiding also. That young man who stood beside me and he said, he told , that was, you know up on the floor it was a department store. They had in the department store, they had honey left. Food was a big thing that time. He comes to me a nd he says before yet, the Russians came, you know what; there\u2122s big, big container of honey there. We will go up there and I will give you a lot of honey. Honey was gold at that time. Th at was already after that incide nt with the Germans so I said now I don\u2122t need him any more. He said, you know what, I will give you the honey, I saved your life but --- he knew already that the Russians are in the corner but when it comes to it, will you save mine? How can I save you?, I said. You know how you can save it. So he knew who I was. Because he wouldn\u2122t ask me that ques tion then whether I can save your life or not. When the Russians came in, when they were already looking for Hungarian soldiers, or non-Jews, you know, he came to me and he said, help me to get out of here. I helped you, you help me. And I did help him to escape. Whether I did it right or wrong, but I did it and he did escape. I don\u2122t know what happened to him. We ll, in any case, then the Russians came in and then of course, it started. I don\u2122t know whet her you know about the aspects of how the Russians behaved. It was soup kitchens again and it was again standing in the line. It was all the ruins and I had nobody. I just walked on the streets, you know. Sawing people coming out of the ghetto. Everybody says, oh Yaneka,_________, _________, __________, and I went there and I had nobody. Because everybody died. I said well, I will look for my aunt. You know that aunt who didn\u2122t believe me? They were in the ghetto and they were the rich aunts in the family because they had a hous e in Hungary. That was like having a house in New York at that time. They had some six, seven rooms. That was an awful lot of room in Hungary. Here, you know people who works can have four rooms too, it\u2122s nothing. In any case, they did survive and I did go to them. It\u2122s nothing. In any case, they did survive and I did go to them. It was a big beautiful reunion. Of course they took away their house, they took away their apartment and they gave them the room where th e maid used to live. There, where the maid used to live, there I was living for them, for a while until they got another room attached to it. They took back their old room, not the house, just a room, because the Russians of course wouldn\u2122t give them back the house. What was life, you will ask me after the bombardment? After the Russians came in? it was a tough life. It wa s first of all, the first days were -- the first week rather after the war. It was also interesting -- you know we lived on the fourth floor when we didn\u2122t go to the shelter. After the so-called fighting, I went up on the fourth floor and looked out the window because I was more or less like fr ee then. Because after five years, you felt that Mommy I survived! I was rather careless that time. I went and I looked out the window because I wanted to see what is a war. You see th is is not a war like here. They drop an atomic bomb and everybody\u2122s boom! Finishe d. There they are fighting corn er to corner. I went up on the window and I looked down and I saw this one is Germans and this one is Russians, they\u2122re shooting. I look out of the window so they shot up. They almost shot my head off. So I got -- well because I didn\u2122t know better. So I went back to there until th ings subsided. At that time, houses were closed yet and Russians were standing all over. Slowly, slowly life got back to it. Everything, you couldn\u2122t buy nothing. As I said, I was secretary for a lawyer. I had to make something, money didn\u2122t mean anything. I had nothi ng anymore to sell. The only thing it is to work and get food for it. The lawyer where I wo rked, whom I worked before once, he took me back. Some people came to him, advise us an d they gave him eggs and bread or pork fat or whatever they gave him, he gave me part of it as payment to the secretary. Until things didn\u2122t get back to more or less, I coul dn\u2122t call it normal because it was far from normal. I met one day a friend of our father and moth er who did survive. Her family didn\u2122t survive bu t her house, her room was bombed. She lived in a small room a nd her living room got a full hit from the bomb and it had a hole in the middle. So I lived in the little room but in that house. She was very attached to me because I was young and I walk ed -- you see the Budapest has many, many beautiful bridges which were all bombed, all the bridges. People went through the Danube back to Buda to get potatoes, flowers or--. Sometimes I brought it back so she was attached to me because she knew that being young, I will bring so mething else. By the way, that time, there was another incident what maybe I will tell you, certain main, main aspects of it. It was a couple of days after the -- after things settled down -- there was a so-called free, free looting. People went with big bags in this big department stores and whatever they found they put it in the bag and they took it home. It was free loot. The Russians st ood there and told you so take it, take it. If you went out empty handed, they send you back to take something. So I\u2122m living there in that house where above it was a department store. In this department store, I thought I will go looting too. Why not, the other people go, but I didn\u2122t. I didn\u2122t prepare myself with the proper thing. I didn\u2122t have a bag, I didn\u2122t have a knife, I didn\u2122t have the scissors so I was not quite made for this looting business. There was big giant men there carting materials and everything. I was just there. If they make me , I was some 85 or 90 pounds, if they gave me a push, I would just fall down. They said if you wa nt to live, you better go away. I want to loot so I went down where the food was. There in the food, people went also and took the silverware and whatever it is. Finally, one guy lif ted me up and put me on a bag of flour. He said you stay here if you want to be alive. Because they were strong people and I was just a -- the wind could blow me away that time. I wa s still there, people took everything and I stood there with -- on the bag of flour until everything was looted out. I stood there with the bag of flour. Of course,, I couldn\u2122t take the bag of fl our and that was full with pickles and jams and everything. On me, but I still was sitting on a bag of flour. What did I do? I had one and only dress and I took the flour and I put it in my -- here like this, in th ere. I went all the way walked that way to my landlady and I said, here we have flour, we make bread from it. Which we took out the glass and we did make bread from it. Bu t after a while, it was got to -- I lived that time, I went away from my aunt and I lived in a fri end\u2122s of mine, the same friend who was together with me in the camp. I went to that house and I lived. You know there was, they call it, belated reaction. When you know you survived, when you know well, five years went away, you survived alone but you survived. Then af ter that when you know that it comes, that psychological for what? And for whom? And for w hy? That was on fourth floor where I lived that time. It was in December. I was just alone, just --. I said, I --I came to the point that I needed help which I personally didn\u2122t get -- ps ychological help. So I opened the window and I went to the windowsill. I thought, well, many pe ople did that by the way, I was not the only one. I said well, let\u2122s finish it up. My landla dy, who was a very nice lady, she came into the room and she says Elizabeth, you must be cr azy. You are opening the window and the whole heat what I put up here, it goes away. I mean I don\u2122t heat here th at you open here the windows. I am standing on the window ledge jumping. I got very mad and I went then. I got so mad that I went to her and I start to hit her. I hit he r and I hit her and she kneeled down beside me and she said, oh, Elizabeth don\u2122t do that, don\u2122t do that. She did that and she said that just to bring me back from the ledge. Was a nice lady. After th at, I said well, okay, let\u2122s start living. I went to the soup kitchen and I asked for a job in the soup kitchen. In there, there are so many incidents, so many incidents happened there duri ng the war, after the wa r, during the bombing, in the ghetto. It is interesting but as I told it to Henry, you cannot go into every aspect."

In that law office, I met a young Jewish man who also survived the war and who met me in th at soup kitchen. He went not for soups because he was at that time in the black market business. He started to me -- at that time people only made money because there was no business, noth ing, it was only black market He started the black market business very successfully. He always had an eye on me but I was not too interested. But after the war, when he gave me a proposition, he said you know what, I mean what is that, you work in the soup kitchen. I have money, you will come and live with me and we will see what we will do. I probably would have become what papers I had before. I said okay and I went to my landlady and I had, as I said, one dress which I washed was full with flours. I said to her, I have a date with that man and he was standing down with the car. I lived on the second floor at that time. I told it to my landlady, he\u2122s waiting and my landlady said okay because she wanted something from him too. I opened the window and I said I coming down five minutes. Ad I said, I had one dress and I went down to go on a road what could end like Madame X or who knows what. I don\u2122t know wh at would have become. But as I walked down the steps going to the guy who\u2122s waiting for me in the house before the car, a Russian soldier comes up the steps.
