This was, on the political ground, it was in the middle, between the right and the left wingers. Later, after the Germans were chased out from Poland, some of them attached themselves to the Communist and some of them were the Nationalists, Akar(ph)."

            "question": "And so at what point did you start to understand or think about or realize that you were part of this movement?",
            "answer": "The moment he send me, when | took the message to the next village, | already understood that this is something, it's a new phase in my hiding, | had to say. And when | delivered the message, in that time, you see, every day you survived. It's like | was, was like a bookkeeping. Every day you survived a new sight . So when | was on the farm, | thought oh, maybe | should sleep here, it'll be another safe day. So | went to the barn to sleep. | asked the farmer could | sleep. Oh, | don't want to go to make, back to my village, | am tired. He said of course you can sleep in the barn. And in the barn night time, some people started to arrive. About one o'clock, a group of about 25 people , And | was ascared they will recognize me as a Jew so | digged in deeper in the straw. And they laid down, they relaxed. And about two hours later, everybody left and the way | find out, from their conversation was they're going on to mine the railroad tracks someplace, not far away. So | understood, that I'm in the midst of a organization, | still didn't know what kind, but later, as you see, special once they did give me a horse and carriage, with a lot of leaflets from the Polish government in exile in London. And | supposed to deliver packages of the leaflets certain safe houses. So on that point | understood that they trust me already Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Thomas Blatt 4 July 26, 1996 Page 4 because | did know all the circuit we were delivering. And | understood for who | am working. Except that this Mr. Russelinski(ph) who was the head of the organization, who took me in to deliver the messages, he only was aware I'm Jewish, in the organization. Nobody else did know. As a matter of fact, the next day, when | was sleeping in this, in this village | mentioned before, it was Sunday the next day and the farmer said, Tom, they called me Tolek(ph) in that area, Tolek(ph) we are going to the church today and this farmer said, \"Tolek, come to the church, we are going to the church. Tolek, come to the church.\" So | said, \"Okay.\" You see, | come, | don't come from an Orthodox family, but my old relatives were Orthodox and watched out for me | should learn the Torah and everything else. My parents really didn't care much. And | believed in God and to be a nice Jewish boy. You should never go without a cap, you know, if you take down the cap, you should have a yarmulke. And still, no matter what, after after everything else, | still felt uneasy taking down the hat. Now they're going to church, | was aware | must take down the hat and what makes it worse, you're going to the church. We went over there and they are taking down the caps, the farmers and there's a big cross. And to take down in front of Jesus and the cross, | felt it's something terrible, |can'tdo. Soldidn't touch my hat. But the farmer looks at me and said, \"Och, like a Jew.\" And he, with his hand he and threw out my cap. So | remember, but later when | was in the church, pretending I'm praying, we prayed of course in Polish and | prayed in Yiddish and asked for forgiveness that | am praying in| achurch. So now! don't mind, you know, it's different, but that time, my mind Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Thomas Blatt 9) July 26, 1996 Page 5 was set this way. So | feel to do some kind, how do you say it in English, blasphemy?"

One was called Akar(ph), AK and | know they killed the Jews. But on the other side, some Jews were members. Mostly doctors and so. So actually everything depends on the person, on the individual and if | was in this organization, maybe one wouldn't hurt me, but | bet there were some would hurt me badly would they find out I'm Jewish. As a matter of fact my friend was hiding in the village. He attached himself to another organization, a leftist organization, where he should feel secure and he was killed by them."

When they did arrive in villages now, it's with big groups and very careful and soon and soon.

And the person was a Russian officer who escaped from, a few POW's were in this village with the Germans and he managed to escape, they were kept in a barn and he was hiding, so | noticed him and | was very happy because you have somebody to, of course it was dangerous, but the Germans were down in the village, | says, uphill. | was happy to see him and we talked and explained that oh, they're machine guns, which meant Russians about 10 miles from here and later when we heard single shots, he explained, oh now they must be someplace in about a mile from here. And later was quiet and he said, \"You know what, | think we are liberated, because the front probably passed the village on the eastern side.\" And | looked down to the village and of course there were no more Germans, but there weren't a lot of Germans, | mean. A few of them and they were mining tanks and they exploded the tanks, probably they didn't have fuel to drive them so they destroyed them before they left and later the, the Germans left and was completely Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Thomas Blatt 9 July 26, 1996 Page 9 quiet, like nothing. So 1! went down with this Russian to the village, looked around and later was walking on the road, not being completely sure that | survived, but | have the feeling, | think this is the moment.

He finally stopped near me and he asked me, \"Germans if nicht(ph)?\" There are no Germans here? | said, \"No, there are no Germans here, they left.\" So he turns around, went back. Few moments later, | seen on the edge of the forest about 200 yards away, somebody in a house and a black coat, overcoat, looking around for a few minutes, turning around and went back to the forest.

And there | realized again, that's another world, because this town, Itsbeetsa(ph) had come to be in 1917, in the 17th century, established by King Auguste(ph), only Jews lived there, 99 percent. The Christian was the mayor the city, commandant of the Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Thomas Blatt 13 July 26, 1996 Page 13 police, the rest only Jews.

Most of the Jews left for Lublin, from the little towns in Poland, being afraid. Now, so we standing, finally one said, \"I'm going to Lublin.\" Then another one went to a friend in the town. And | went to people | was friendly with, our neighbors and there was a bakery, Kulikoffska(ph) bakery. | went to her, a short lady, probably in her 60's. She helped my before.

And we worked Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Thomas Blatt 14 July 26, 1996 Page 14 til about eight and the bagels were ready by eight for the and eight o'clock | went back to sleep in the attic.

So this also a reason why now we have more, we talk more about this than before."

Jewish philosopher. He was thrown out in Jew's society, you know. There is some, you could say I'm agnostic, not atheist. There is some power which is ruling the world and of course obvious, the balance between water and the air and whatever their ending is, you know, proclamation, generations after the generations. There is some logical balance and everything is Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Thomas Blatt 68 July 26, 1996 Page 68 in logic and but | believe there's some power which we don't understand. It's either religion logical explanation of things, come to a stop and people can't live in the emptiness, so they did think about different stories and one of them is religion, an explanation, people don't need to, to, to search for others, for an explanation, . So God, in the religious way...[End of Side 1, Tape 3]...Another way to say | don't believe in a theological God, | believe there's a power. And we don't know what , maybe someday we will come to the truth."

But again, how could you be at odds, if you don't believe in Him. So, put it this way, I'm a non-believer, but a Jew. Some say you can't be a Jew if you don't believe in Judaism, in religion, in the past. But why not? You could be a Jew, you don't need to be a religious Jew."

This is one of them. I'm not religious, I'm a Jew.

            "answer": "Well the experience of the Holocaust first of all make me a agnostic. The experience of the Holocaust, not so, the history of the human beings, which | studied very carefully, history of Jews, history of the world and so on, make me wonder if it could happen again. And | think it could very easy happen again. First of all, if you learn from history, it's a very well, a very well known saying, history repeat himself. Why should it stop here? And it's proven, that the , our culture, didn't put a stop to it. As a matter of fact, the technology made it worse. Next time something will, something happened, there'll be computers. You wouldn't be able to say I'm not that or that. You push the button, they have your whole story. So it could happen. You could see the feeling against Jews Is not, you scratch it in some societies and comes up, without scratching it comes up. People will always hate the smarter, the very well off and people will always look for excuse why they are miserable. So if like Jews, a nation didn't have anybody to protect them in that time, you could fell easy prey to hate. Now we have Israel, which in a way could protect, but from my experience, | don't talk, | don't look the positive way on the future. | think it could happen. It doesn't take much, it should change. | sometime go over on a bus in Los Angeles, | went to Nazi meetings, | get Nazi magazines, | subscribe. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Thomas Blatt 70 July 26, 1996 Page 70 Not for support, I'm not a supporter, but | want to know why they think. And you go to such a meeting, you really see it how it is, it's not so simple. The America think we are fairly secure . To summarize it, | don't want to turn my head away, it could happen again.
