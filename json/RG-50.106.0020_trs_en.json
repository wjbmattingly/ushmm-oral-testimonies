I mean, you install a unirat (ph) for representation from all different branches. So if we gonna deal with you, we need labor, for instance, or money, anything like that. Inside you control Jews, inside the ghetto. Police force, Jewish police. So unirat (ph) was established throughout the way when the ghetto was established. I think it was over 12 or 15 people representing the unirat (ph), although we had ____________ wanting charge of the -- especially labor was important, you know, and they -- right away they took you to any type of labor work.

The war was still going on in August -- in July that\u2122s gonna be 50 years. And I came to Bialystok, and Bialystok was already a temporary capitol, at least while the war was going on.

We knew that because it started, eventually, the survivors came in some. Some escaped and they came in the Prujena (ph) ghetto. We heard about that, heard about gassing and professional killing. Killing, you know, they took you out to dig your own real wide and give you a grave eventually. We heard stories about that.

Y ou know, in your mind, you figure, well, maybe -- this is -- you\u2122re still in the ghetto. You didn\u2122t expect, you know, the order of provision wasn\u2122t in yet, but somehow, the feeling was -- and people were supplying us with food for weeks. Some were, you k now, big, big -- I don\u2122t know. We had, in the back, a little -- what do you call it? -- outside the house, a little storage space, whatever you call it. So I remember, too, you know. And I could build a little space down there, a little space -- not for the whole family, just couple of places just for us two, me and my brother. It was a panic building. And eventually, what happens, maybe the Germans knew. That\u2122s why every so often they changed the dimensions of the ghetto. Like, we had already -- in the beginning, it was easier to make an underground tunnel. It was easy then because, you know, it was allowed. Each wanted a little strip, you know, like the old people, the old time. The citizens -- like over here, you had a house and you had a whole lot of wind around the house. Each one made their own -- you had your own garden. You had your own vegetables. So you made -- you\u2122re putting them in the garden. You dig out and make a little, you know, and covered it. Make a little tunnel or something like that. And over here, some something -- how could you do that? So each one of the Germans -- they didn\u2122t come in in the ghetto. Only once in a while they\u2122ll come in to the unirat (ph) and give orders. \ufb01We need this, we need this, we need this and we need that.\ufb02 And a lot of them could be bribed. They could be -- I would say that every one could be bribed Joseph Elman 45 [date] Page 45 for a little till, you know -- \u201atil the time comes because what\u2122s he got to lose (ph). I mean, it can be mad, it can be tough to you, but you kno w, the unirat (ph) gives you \ufb01Well, this has happened, you know?\ufb02 I didn\u2122t tell you, you know they did to our rabbi? The rabbi of the city, you know, with a __________, a very famous rabbi. Now, took from the Leimans (ph), brought us, you know, the one w e killed, the Leiman brother (ph), and he was such a tough cookie. Tough. Now, he took the rabbi -- came to his house and took the rabbi out and made him run -- take the towers. Said put the towers in the trailer and they made him run (ph). Eventually, you know, somebody saw him and reported to the unirat. And the unirat, somebody came out and they took him in, you know, I don\u2122t know, to bribe him. You want -- you know, a trick to take the rabbi in order to get a good bribe."

Now, he had a son and a daughter, so why? Because they were studying in Europe. YOu probably got paid pretty good. In those years, you know it was like over here. He probably managed to send the children out. They survived. I met the son, you know, way back, when they come into New York (ph). It was the same thing.
