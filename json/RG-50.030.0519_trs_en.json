And it\u2122s hard to make a living there, in Israel right now. And my uncle wrote the letter to come over here. I didn\u2122t know what he is doing. He brought me into his house, you know, the bi g f -- big house, took me in and my wife, and at that time I came, I had my son with me. We stayed with them. It didn\u2122t work out too good, because he, my uncle, is -- his niece was a single girl. When they brought me in over here, they always had in the mind I\u2122m going to come in, marry that girl. When I brought my wife, wasn\u2122t so -- they weren\u2122t too happy. So when I find out what it is, I decided to move to go someplace else. So a friend of mine was from my own town, and he knew that I\u2122m not getting along, but no fights, just I know that it\u2122s not a good feeling there. So he said, move into my house. He has a 38 one bedroom house, and I moved in in the living room, we had a bed on the floor and we stayed together for a little bit. Then I got in -- I met a guy that is look ing for a job, so I find out the guy has a [indecipherable], and his wife was my older si ster\u2122s best girlfriend in Koretz. So when he finds I\u2122m over here, so he can start talk to me, what do you want to do in America? I says, I will do anything, I just want a job. So he took me out one day, he drove around with me. He said, I\u2122m building here and I\u2122m building -- it was a big buil ding. And then we pass by a lumber yard that says a -- a few Jewish people working over there, I -- I couldn\u2122t speak nothing in English, you know. He said, maybe you want to work over here, I says good. So, next morning I went to work over there. And I worked there for a few months, and before [indecipherable] he came into me one day, he says, everybody likes you over here. I want you to be the buyer to buy the lumber. I said, buy the lumber for what? I don\u2122t know how to talk. How do you gonna buy it? He said, well, I\u2122ll hire, I got a girl over here, a Polish girl, and she\u2122ll work with you together. You do the buying. I says, you\u2122re making fun of me. He said no. So, before I turn around they made me the foreman, then I started doing the buying in the lumber yard."

So a guy used to pick me up all the time, take me back to work. And this was about 20 miles. But the guy was nice to doing it, because [indecipherable] the boss in there. But by about two years I was 39 working over there, and everybody find out with me I\u2122m a good worker. And they don\u2122t pay me too much. As [indecipherable] pay me 50 dollars a week, seven days a week, and I didn\u2122t care, I make maybe [indecipherable] some body else [indecipherable] 75 dollars a week.

Said, no, no, no, you cannot do it. He says, you have to pay right now for the four weeks. Well, okay, I have to, I have to, take it all, the whole thing, you know. And then [indecipherable] he said no, don\u2122t worry about it, the car is a present for you. You know, that made -- made a -- a big deal, yeah. And [indecipherable] open up the lumber yard [indecipherable] the two partners. They fight -- fighting between them and he come to me and says to me, you know what? We closing up the pl ace. I want you to go into business. You take over the place. I says, I\u2122m gonna take over the place? I ain\u2122t got no money. Then he says, well, we\u2122ll work it out somehow. So, he went, he br ought me another guy, he says, that guy\u2122s gonna go in partners with you. So another guy comes in the partners and start talking to me. He say, we\u2122re gonna go into business, does he have any money. I says no, do you have any money? He says no. So what are we going? Says well, the people what you deal with them with buying, go into Mr. Martin, tell him that you want to go into business. So I go and tell the guys they\u2122re gonna go in business. He says okay -- I-I -- I was buying for them. He says, show me your statement. I said, what\u2122s a statement? I didn\u2122 t know nothing [indecipherable]. So I stayed with 40 them for awhile, then I stay with a partner, and go ing to the -- to the banker that didn\u2122t know me from somebody -- from the other people. I said th e same thing, I want to go into business, but I need money. Said the same thing, give me a statement. So, I don\u2122t know what you\u2122re talking about. Make the story short, the guy gave me 3,000 dollars credit, [indecipherable] give me 3,000 dollars credit. And we got [indecipherable] in the business, had good customers, the [indecipherable] was a big builder and he paid me every week.
