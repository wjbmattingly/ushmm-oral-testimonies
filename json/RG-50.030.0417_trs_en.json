            "answer": "It was very predictable. It was very middle class. It was very secure. It was very unpretentious, although there was a maid for the children and a maid for the house, and we went on nice vacation. There were music lessons and English lessons and dancing lessons. But we took it for granted. My parents were rather strict \u2014 strict in terms of schooling, of grades, strict when I didn\u2019t practice violin. Children had to be seen but not heard. When my USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 3 parents discussed personal things or business events, they would speak Polish. I did not understand. When they talked to me and later on to my sister, 1t was in German. Occasionally, they would speak French, but not very often. It was \u2014 it was a nice childhood. The memories I have until 1933, when I was eight, are warm and they are loving. I really could not fault my parents for anything other than that were really very, very strict and very demanding. It was very important that a report card had an \u201cA\u201d, maybe a \u201cB\u201d\u2019, but anything below that was not acceptable."

            "answer": "Nothing would happen, but there would be reprimand, there would be a conference with the teacher, and after \u00b033, when the grades slipped considerably, then there was a different tutor every afternoon \u2014 one for German, one for Math, one for English, one for French, and the grades did improve. What my parents did not consider was that the outside world had an influence on children. They told us that things would change. It would not remain this way. The neighbor\u2019s children would begin to play with us again. The boys would no longer beat us up on the way to school. It would \u2014 life would normalize. They didn\u2019t say exactly when, but they were very reassuring and very convinced that there would be a political change. And my parents, of course, could not vote in German elections. They never became naturalized German citizens. They didn\u2019t want to. We went to Poland quite frequently to see the family, to see Grandmother, and what I heard in Poland as a very young child was that you, in Germany, are complaining about anti-Semitism. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like in Poland. Your economic conditions do not compare to ours. To me, it did not make sense."

            "answer": "No. I could not comprehend. My grandmother spoke Polish. She spoke Yiddish to me, and I answered in German, but I really did not comprehend. The family in Poland was well-off, but nothing compared to life in Germany. For instance, the streets in this little town were not \u2014 the streets were dirt streets, and when the peasants were pushing their wagons through the main street of the town, they took their shoes off because it was muddy, and I could see their feet with the \u2014 with the mud oozing through the toes. When we arrived by train in Poland, we were picked up by a cousin with a horse and buggy. Well, I would not go into the buggy \u2014 not with a horse in front of it that was moving. I was used to a black taxi with white stripes. So, these things I remember. I remember them warmly. I \u2014 I remember that, and I appreciate that, I had a part of that culture, because it ended too soon."

How well the business did, I never knew. I was never told. I had a small allowance, probably of 50 cents a month. I didn\u2019t need anything, and I was not allowed to buy frivolous items.

The teachers were \u2014 at that time \u2014 in their late 50s, and to me terribly old. They were very strict and they USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 5 were very orthodox. You had to adhere to the rules and regulations. On Saturday, you didn\u2019t take a streetcar. You didn\u2019t write. You did not carry a purse. You pinned your handkerchief to your jacket. You learned Hebrew, post-modern Hebrew. You learned Humash and Gemora and you had to translate. It was mandatory, five days a week. School was not a happy experience. It was very rigid, very regimented, very German in spite of the fact that the teachers were all Jewish, very demanding and it lacked compassion, understanding for the children. We were told going home on the streetcar to stand in the back, to be quiet, not to talk loudly, not to draw attention, and I remember saying one day, \u201cThey want us to become invisible. How does one do that?\u201d"

I could not understand what I had done to deserve the punishment of being beaten up on the street or having stones thrown at me or obscene names. I did not \u2014 I did not realize the impact, and I believed at that point, that it would change."

            "question": "Let me go back to your parents for just a moment. Did you feel closer to one parent more than another? Or were they both very similar for you?",
            "answer": "They were very similar both in background, in education, in upbringing. I would say my mother was more reserved. She never contradicted my father. She agreed with all of his decisions. I think I can only recall two times when she disagreed. She came home one day and had cut off her long black hair which was tied to the top of her head, and she came home USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 6 with a fashionable bob. And the other thing she did \u2014 which was before I was born, but I heard the story \u2014 during the inflation, under the inflation of 1922, she pawned her silver to keep the business afloat, and she did not ask permission. After the business prospered, she of course got it back, but I think during the middle \u201930s, early \u201930s, she deferred him in all other decisions. I did not know at that time that my father bought commercial real estate. It was never mentioned. The decision was made between my father and my mother\u2019s brother, younger brother, who was an associate, but we had no idea about it. We might have picked up a word or two, but we would have never asked. That wasn\u2019t done."

            "answer": "There were very few questions at the dinner table. The maid would sometimes bring in a dish or plates, and then the language would immediately switch to Polish. We were asked questions about school, but not necessarily at the dinner table. It was when it came time to do homework, or when you wanted to postpone homework and the answer was, \u201cNo, homework first.\u201d It was a typical education of the \u201930s when you had to be within the role of a child, not have the freedom of being light-hearted or joking or tell funny stories.

Each precinct had a \u2014 each living area had a precinct and it was mandatory that when you moved into an apartment or into a house that you register at the precinct \u2014 name, address, occupation, tax id number, and religion. When you decided to move from A Street to B Street, you went back to the precinct. You told them where you\u2019re moving to. You went to the new precinct, and you went through the procedure again.

The other thing I remember is that on November 10\" or 11\", we had a knock on the door at four in the morning, and there was my mother\u2019s brother and his son and his wife, and they had spent the night in a train from Cottbus to come to Hamburg to escape the arrest of all males which took place on the 10\" of November.

            "answer": "The Polish Consul in Hamburg was supplied \u2014 was supposed to supply a stamp or a validation on all Polish passports, those of Jews and non-Jews, except there happened to be USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 15 no non-Jews. But, for some reason, he refused. Whether the reasons were anti-Semitic or not, he refused, and I only know of one or two cases where bribery worked, which was very unusual. The moment he refused to validate the passports, the Germans said, \u201cYou\u2019re no longer a valid foreign national living on German ground.\u201d At five-of-one in the morning, they rounded up \u2014 they came to our door. They rang the bell, and it was local police. And they said, \u201cYou have to come with me because of the matter of the stamps, and we take you to a schoolyard downtown.\u201d And my father said, \u201cMy wife just had surgery three months ago. Can she stay with the children?\u201d And my sister and I stood in the hallway and listened, and since he was a local policeman, he said, \u201cAll right. You come with me, and I let the family stay.\u201d By afternoon, we heard by phone that this was done throughout the city, and they had rounded up several thousand people, or maybe in Hamburg alone it was not quite as much, and that they were held in a schoolyard, and somebody suggested that we bring my father a suitcase with some clothing. But they also said for my mother not to go because they would keep her. She packed a suitcase and I insisted to take it down. It was heavy. I took public transportation. I took the subway \u2014 the underground and the above-ground, and I dragged that suitcase all the way down to the schoolyard. The gate was open and I started looking for my father, but there were a great many people \u2014 men, women and children, and he found me. I gave him the suitcase, and I remember distinctly saying to him, \u201cCome home with me. The gate is open. There is no guard. There are no people. Just come home and we\u2019ll hide, or something.\u201d And my father looked at me and he said, \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be the honorable thing to do.\u201d I did not understand what he meant, but my father played by the rules. When the law was published that you were not allowed to have foreign currency or to have currency in a foreign country, my father took the money that was in Holland and USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 16 brought it back to Germany. So, you played by the rules, which I learned many years later that you don\u2019t have to. He could have just walked out. Nobody would have said a thing, and some people did, but very few. He was pushed over the border. The Poles pushed back, and the Germans pushed him in. They got to Zbaszyn, from Zbaszyn he went to Posen. He stayed there two months. He tried to come back to Germany. He couldn\u2019t get an entry visa, and he went to Sambor, to mother\u2019s family, and he stayed there until May 1940, no 1939, excuse me, when he got permission to come back for four weeks. In the meantime, my mother decided to liquidate the household and to ship all that was contained in an eight-room apartment in huge containers to Palestine, to my father\u2019s brother. She handled the shipping. She handled the packing. She handled the Gestapo who came to watch, and tried to approve every single item that went out of the country. She put a bottle of wine and two glasses on the table, and she refilled it with two or three more bottles, and they drank a great deal and we packed fast."

            "question": "The two Gestapo, not your mother?",
            "answer": "No, no, no. She just talked to the packers, \u201cHurry up, pack.\u201d We did not take anything of any particular value, just the furniture, clothing, linens and silverware, jewelry \u2014 whatever we normally had in the apartment, but the faster the better. The two crates were packed. They were picked-up, and they were shipped to Trieste. We, in the meantime, had to give up under new German laws the apartment and we were assigned to a room on Werder Street Five. In the meantime, my father was granted permission and he came back. I think the permission partly was through the intervention of my mother who hounded the Gestapo in the Staathaus USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 17 in Hamburg. She wrote. She went in. She talked to them. They threatened with arrest. She didn\u2019t give up. I never thought that a quiet, reserved woman would do what she did, and it absolutely amazed me. When my father came back, we started to work on an affidavit for the United States, and it certificate for Palestine. The four weeks ran out. My mother got an extension for another four weeks, and another four weeks, and one morning, on September 1S, the doorbell rang at five in the morning, six in the morning, and two men appeared with hats and long, black leather coats, and 1t was September. It was warm. And they asked for my father, and they said that Germany is at war with Poland. We have invaded Poland. You are an enemy alien, and you have to come with us. And that was the first day of the Second World War. He was first sent to a prison in Fuhlsbuttel, which later became a concentration camp, and we were still allowed to bring every week a briefcase with laundry and take home a briefcase with dirty laundry for about two or three weeks, but Poland lost the war for all intents and purposes within two weeks. They had pockets of resistance, but not of war, and the moment that became a fact, my father was transported to Berlin to Oranienburg, to Sachsenhausen, and the mail stopped coming. It was sort of an aerogram with one sentence: \u201cT\u2019m fine. I hope you are fine. Love, Ben.\u201d These letters became less and less frequent, until one arrived from Dachau. We had never heard of the place. My mother made, I would say, twice monthly trips to the Gestapo in Hamburg, in the Stathaus, pleading for release, trying to work for an exit visa, trying to work towards immigration papers, anyplace, writing a letter every week to the head of the Gestapo. The end result was that they brought my father to Gestapo headquarters for an hour\u2019s visit. He had on a grey and blue striped prison uniform and matching cap. We were sitting on opposite sides of the table, no touching. We talked but nobody could talk. My mother assured him she would try. It was a Catch-22. To go to USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 18 Shanghai, you had to have 400 American dollars, but you weren\u2019t allowed to have American currencies, and we had nobody who would give it to us. Our accounts had been blocked. Our money had been confiscated. We got a hundred dollars a month allowance to live on, no more. We had to move to the apartment next door, number seven. I still went to school. My sister still went to school. We went to the Jewish Community Council, who was headed at that time by a Doctor Plaut (ph). Doctor Plaut at that time was a man in his early 50s. He was unmarried. You had to wait for an audience, like you wait for the pope. We pleaded for papers because it was an emergency because somebody was sitting in a concentration camp, and he shrugged his shoulders and he said there was nothing he could do, but he became very well known for the fact that you could buy favors, but that was 1939, 1940. We heard rumors. He married a very much younger woman with two young children, and he remained, as I\u2019m told, in Germany and was exchanged for a German I believe in Yugoslavia, pretty much into the war \u201943-\u201944. He ended up in Palestine. My father remained in Dachau and one man was released, and he had papers, first for Italy and then for Palestine, and my mother and I went to see him one evening after curfew, and we saw this six foot tall man who was a skeleton \u2014 no front teeth, shaven head \u2014 and when my mother asked him, \u201cHow is Benno?\u201d He said, \u201cFine.\u201d He managed to leave Germany with his wife and two children, and he promised to help once he would be outside. Going back to \u201939, when my father returned from Poland, he talked to the Italian Consul and they were on friendly terms, and he offered my father a three-day visa to Italy, and my father said, \u201cAnd what do I do after the three days?\u201d And being Italian the man said, \u201cGo, and worry later.\u201d My father wouldn\u2019t go. He was murdered in Dachau in February 1941. The Gestapo did something that the very rarely did. They brought us a cigar boxes with ashes. Whose ashes? We will never know.

            "answer": "I saw the German soldiers lined up. The railroad cars were opened. We were ordered to come out. We were ordered to line up in rows of five, and we saw a whole group of men in black jackets, black trouser, a black hat with an orange band, an orange arm band with the Star of David, and on their jackets were also yellow stars. The Germans handed us over to these men. The name given to them was \u201cghetto police\u201d. The ground was sandy. It was dirty. It was not a railroad station. We saw a wagon drawn by two horses and our suitcases were thrown on that wagon. The Germans went back into the trains, and the ghetto police explained to us \u2014 mostly in Polish, and hardly anybody spoke Polish \u2014 that we had to walk USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 43 into the ghetto. My mother, who stood next to me, asked the first available policeman in Polish, \u201c\u201cWhere are we? What is the ghetto? What\u2019s going on?\u201d And on the hour and a half or two-hour walk, and it was very warm and there were many elderly people, he explained to my mother that it was the city of Lodz, which was familiar to her. It was the ghetto, which was an area that was totally enclosed. And as we kept on walking, we saw people that didn\u2019t look at us. They looked ragged. They looked tired. They looked ill-fed and ill-dressed. And we saw buildings that were dilapidated. Some were \u2014 some streets were paved; others were not. We saw no vehicles. We saw no automobiles. We saw no trucks. But he explained to my mother, and she translated, that the ghetto was an area that was fenced in and guarded by Germans. There was no into the ghetto; there was no out of the ghetto. And my mother made a very flippant remark, \u201cWell, if you want to get out of this situation, you always can.\u201d And he said, \u201cHardly.\u201d They walked us to a school on Mlynarska Street. This school evidently had been abandoned, and they housed all 1,100 of us on two, possibly three, stories in what used to be classrooms, lecture rooms. We eventually got our suitcases. We put our coats or whoever had a blanket on the floor, and that\u2019s how we lived for six weeks. The Jewish ghetto administration sent in a kitchen detail once a day to bring soup. This soup was mainly water, very little else. In the mornings, we received sometimes a slice of bread and a liquid that was bitter tasting and supposed to look like coffee, but it had a grainy substance. It had no coffee. And at that point, most of us still had some money, which we had brought from Germany. Some of it sewn into shoulder pads, into belts, into shoes. And those of us who had some money \u2014 some more, others less \u2014 you could go into the courtyard and the people who had lived in the ghetto since 1940 when it was first closed would sell out of newspaper a little piece of bread, a chunk of margarine, anything edible, and we would buy it with this German USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 44 money, not realizing that the currency in the ghetto was not German money. It was special ghetto-printed money similar to Monopoly money, and that we were by far overpaying. When we ran out of the money, we would sell some of our so-called \u201cwestern\u201d belongings \u2014 a silk blouse, a silk scarf, an alligator purse \u2014 whatever any family had brought along and it was deemed no longer necessary, superfluous, and it brought in some food. These things were not sold for money. They were bartered for food. I remember seeing my mother in the courtyard bartering for bread and margarine against a silk blouse."

It had to last at that point a week, and we cut it into seven or eight wedges once we got our permanent food rations. And I took my mother\u2019s example, and I had a purse. And when she did not realize it, I did the same thing. I traded the purse for some bread. It was traded to a young woman a little older than I was, who came with a very good- looking gentleman probably ten years older who had a briefcase, and he wanted to give me one piece of bread and I said, \u201cIt\u2019s too little.\u201d And they laughed. They didn\u2019t speak German and I didn\u2019t speak Polish, but we managed. And I stood there for two hours and eventually they came back and I got two pieces of bread. But even that had limitation because you ran out of tradable goods. Nobody had jewelry. That had to be left for the Germans. And what was left was really the bare essentials, not more than that. After six weeks, we were assigned to various rooms."

            "answer": "There was a pump in the courtyard, and if you knew somebody with either a bowl or a bucket, you would borrow it. In the beginning, we had some soap, but you use up soap and then you make do without soap. This school had outhouses in the backyard. The outhouses were used by 1,100 people. They were filthy. They were unsanitary. People got sick. There were accidents. You washed and we used to call it a cat\u2019s wash because you really couldn\u2019t wash. There was no privacy. There was no place. There was no room. I remember standing in a corner holding up a blanket. My mother was behind the blanket washing and vice versa. So, sanitary conditions didn\u2019t exist. At night, we slept on the floor. In the daytime, we sat on the floor. Crowded, one body next to the other. And eventually, six weeks later, we were assigned to various rooms throughout the ghetto on both sides of the bridges. The older part of the ghetto was the Balut, the former slum of the city. It used to house Jews and non-Jews, but had been vacated for Jews only. We were fortunate enough to be settled in the little newer section on the front side of the bridge. We shared a probably 10 by 10 foot room with four other people. We had two or three wooden cots. My mother brought a little wardrobe so we didn\u2019t have to hang the clothing on the damp walls. The view out of the window was a barbed wire and the red century house with a German marching up and down. So, we did not go near the window. At night, you had to put a black sheet over the window so no light could come out because it was wartime. And the room had a little cast iron stove, but there was no lumber. We slowly took out of the wooden cots one board at a time, cut it up for heat and for cooking. We were issued ration cards, and the food distribution centers were throughout the ghettos. The intervals of the spaces between them were several kilometers. When a food ration was announced or posted on the walls, it gave a date when it would be available, and how much, and what items. You had to bring your own containers, and during the first week, USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 46 you stood in line for about three hours until you got your food. If you waited beyond that, there were no more lines but sometimes the food ran out."

There was no transportation within the ghetto to get from one place to another. There was an internal police force. There was a fire brigade. I don\u2019t think it was ever used, and aside from the police force there was a Sonder force, that meant special police with special orders, with more difficult tasks which larger, with larger food allotments, and some of these men were decent, and some were brutal."

Citric acid thrown into a pot of raw vegetables makes it boil faster, but what are you going to do with that quantity. It was a senseless type of distribution, but the food was distributed the way it came into the ghetto from Germany.

            "answer": "We did at first, and then one evening we had knock at the door. It must have been around January. And in walked a short little man by the name of Adolf Goetz, and he had lived around the corner from us in Hamburg on Holle Street. We lived on Braumsen Way (ph). We didn\u2019t know him but we\u2019d wave from the back window. He had a short little wife with very curly hair and she used to shake out her rugs off the balcony. And he came in with another man and he used to be a dentist in Hamburg. I think it was Rosenblum. And he had remembered us and he said to my mother, \u201cI have been given permission to open an office. Would you allow your daughter to work in that office?\u201d My mother said, \u201cSure.\u201d \u201cWell, she doesn\u2019t get much money. You know how it is, but she\u2019 Il get a daily soup.\u201d Adolph Goetz had a terrific sense of humor. He was probably not even five foot tall. He wore glasses, and he had a funny face that you would expect to see in a cartoon, a very pinched little face. He had been a playwright. He had been an engineer. He had a son in South America some place, and he convinced Rumkowski that the ghetto needed improvement and beautification. And he hired probably a dozen architects and engineers that had come from Prague on this so-called Intelligenz transport, as they called themselves because everybody had a college degree, among them the general director of Schoda (ph), which was Dr. Reich. And they were supposed to draw up blue prints with parks, with schools, with trees, with playgrounds. And I was supposed to do some typing, but I couldn\u2019t type very well, and write the explanations to these blueprints. And every once in a while Adolph Goetz would take the blueprints to Balutaring, to Rumkowski, and Rumkowski seemed enthused. And we got the midday soup. USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 57 The office was on Rybn, 8. And oh, Adolph must have been in his late \u201960s at a guess, and for fun he wrote poems and he wrote stories. And he would make little airplanes out of them, and just sort of fly them over the office onto my desk. That went on for several months. I didn\u2019t know what to make it, but it was sort of funny. But he complained bitterly about the lack of food, but the office remained for about six months, and then he was summoned by Rumkowsk1, and he was told, \u201cI\u2019m terminating the office. I\u2019m closing down the office. And all of you can look for other jobs.\u201d In the meantime, he had gotten double rations, which of course I didn\u2019t know. And he was really unhappy for himself and for us, as well. And everybody tried to get a job someplace else. Dr. Reich went to work for the lumber department for Goodman. Some others found employment some place else, and by then it was July. And my mother died on the 30\" of July 1942 of hunger."

We did not hear. My sister and I walked to the Jewish cemetery in Marysin, about a two-hour walk. And in the burial hall, we went through hundreds of bodies. And most bodies were between two boards, wooden boards, tied together with a string and a name tag. We found my mother\u2019s body. And we took two shovels. And we looked for a plot and there were no more plots left on the cemetery. So, we found a walkway, and we spent that July day digging a grave until it was deep enough to bury her. We put a wooden marker on it. We scratched the name with a stone on the marker, and we walked back. From that day on, I think, my sister stopped talking."

I found some work in the factory sewing ladies\u2019 dresses, but it was a two hour walk to Marysin. And I worked at a machine for a while. And the interesting part in that factory was that it employed young people my age, a little older, and they were very intent on striking, on asking for more food. One young woman named Fajga made us walk, those willing to walk, around the courtyard, \u201cNo food. No work.\u201d It took an hour, and the police \u2014 the Jewish ghetto police \u2014 came into the courtyard and took her away.

            "num": 299,
            "question": "Okay.",
            "answer": "The essence of the speech was that the Germans had demanded 20,000 sick, elderly, and children, most of them children to be sent out of the ghetto. And the wording of the speech was, and that I think is a matter of record, \u201cMothers and fathers, give me your children so that the rest of us may live and survive.\u201d There were outcries, maybe a stone or two were thrown, but police was present. He tried to explain that he tried to negotiate that they wouldn\u2019t take children over 11 years of age, but they would have to take the sick. He got the number decreased by a thousand and various other justifications. Those who heard the speech and those who found about it were appalled. It was \u2014 the concept was unthinkable. During the process, that the deportation was announced by Rumkowski, and by the time he had the lists on the streets of the people written up, the Germans got angry and impatient. They enforced a curfew of seven days starting in September, I believe it was the 7\". We were not supposed to be out on the street for seven days and seven nights. The Germans came into the ghetto with trucks, with dogs and with guns. They went from street to street and from house to house, and the square area of the ghetto was not very large. And it went house by house. They came to our street. We had a neighbor sit on the roof and look out. And when they entered the courtyard, they shouted for everybody to assemble in the courtyard. And then they went into the building and found those who had hidden. They beat them and put them on USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 64 the truck. And then the looked at the remainder of those standing in the courtyard, probably 60 people, and within five minutes, they separated the old and the young from the more fit human beings. My sister, although she was 11 years old, not 10, was taken. I tried to go onto the truck with her. The guns stopped me. The truck drove off. My neighbor\u2019s mother was taken \u2014 many people out of the building. He was a policeman. He couldn\u2019t get his mother released. We never found out where they were taken, what was done with them, where they supposedly were resettled, in what labor camp they might have been sent. But eventually, a few packages of clothing came back into the ghetto. And supposedly \u2014 I did not see it \u2014 some of the clothing was blood-stained. Actual notes or actual letters I don\u2019t believe were found. Nobody could give us an answer. We hoped that they were alive \u2014 someplace, somewhere. And the curfew was lifted after seven days, and life continued for the rest of us. It was almost as 1f we had been hypnotized, as if we just \u2014 we just went on. We went to work. We collected the soup. We collected the food ration. It continued. We had been robbed not of our children, but of our feelings, of our compassion. Some children were hidden, but very few. How he could have asked to hand over the children, I did not understand at 16. I don\u2019t understand it now. Did he have a choice? I would say so. Czerniakow had a choice. I mean, his life was not so precious that he could not have said no. He could have refused to obey the orders. He would have paid the price, but to ask this of the community is unthinkable. I was fired from the dress factory. I don\u2019t know for what reason, probably incompetence. I did not sew very well. And I went back to the office on Rybna, 8 because I knew a woman there from Vienna. And by then it was October, and it was cold, and we stood around the stove and I said, \u201cI need a job desperately.\u201d And her boss, who sat a desk in the corner, came over. He started talking to me, and by then I spoke Polish and Yiddish, and he said, \u201cIll give you a job.\u201d I USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 65 said, \u201cDoing what?\u201d And he said, \u201cWe have received truckloads of forms to be completed for the Germans in Germany for their coal rations. And the forms have to be figured and completed. And you\u2019ll sit in the office. I need 300 people. You write down the names. People will tell you they\u2019Il work here. You just get their addresses, and you just do it.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, Pll do it. A job is a job.\u201d His boss was Henryk Neftalin, the attorney, who was in his late 30s. A very fair man. A very able man. I had met his mother when I was running around with those passports a year earlier. And he was much admired. The strange thing was that he had Rumkowski\u2019s ear. When he would go to Rumkowski, he might take some abuse, but in the end, he would argue. And half the time, Rumkowski would listen. So, he was much admired. His girlfriend worked in one of the administrative offices. Her name was Klatalka (ph). And I worked in that office, I would say, until 43, end of \u201943. And one day Bernard Fuchs decided \u2014 he was the head of the Department of Labor \u2014 that too many people worked in that office, and he needed people in the straw shoe factory for the Russian front. And the commission of several dignitaries came, among them Rumkowsk1i. And it was again a selection of who goes and who stays. And I hid pretty much to the bitter end until I was called, because they had my name on the list. And Rumkowski sat on a chair. He had taken off his hat and his coat, and he had his cane in his right hand. And for a minute, he reminded me of a fairy tale \u2014 a king sitting on a throne. He spoke to me in Yiddish and he asked me my name, whether I had family, where I had come from, and in the end he said, \u201cLittle German, you may stay, and you'll hear from me.\u201d He took a lot of people out of that office at that particular time. Bernard Fuchs threw out the list as he had drawn up previous deportation lists. I had gone to his office when I was jobless and asked him for employment because he was born in Hannover, Germany, and he spoke German. And after my third visit, he lost his temper, and USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 66 he said that he had not jobs, that I was a pest, or the equivalent in Polish. He opened the door and he yelled like a German, \u201cRaus!\u201d\u2019"

And there were many that were capable, that were intelligent, but they wouldn\u2019t hire a woman. That was competition \u2014 a man, yes \u2014 a woman, no. So, I went back to work, and a few weeks later, my boss Henryk Neftalin called me into his office and he said, \u201cI\u2019m transferring you to the Statistical Department on Plac Koscielny, 4.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to leave because I\u2019d become very friendly with Spiegel and I did not like the unknown.

It could have been the fact that I came to work one day with a very bloody face when I had been sent to the Kripo because somebody USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 67 said I had a radio, and I never did have a radio. And he saw my bloody scars, my bloody face, my bruised eyes. He transferred me because in essence he was the actual head of the Statistical Department. He had the first word and the last word. It was a long way to work over the bridge. And 1n winter it was hard to walk, so they unshoveled snow on the bridge. You slid back rather than forward. Hundreds of people cross the bridge every morning, and you were afraid that somebody would carry lice and they would jump over on your clothing. That was the greatest fear because they carried typhus. The office..."

            "answer": "Betezak like a bed, Betczak. And, he would come and sweep around the offices and he would sit there at ten at night or whatever time it was, and Spiegel would read his drafts on which he worked most of the daytime although he wasn\u2019t supposed to, and \u2014 in Yiddish \u2014 and he told me what to think about them, whether they were good or not so good. And I listened, and some of his poetry is very beautiful. And the short stories really took me very much by surprised. They were fiction, but they were the story of the man who lost his horse to hunger, or the Germans killed an animal, or the father who stole bread from the children. He wrote a book during the ghetto time that was called \u201cMalches Ghetto\u201d \u2014 \u201cKingdom Ghetto\u201d, and it gives a story of the church on the Platske Chernya (ph), and the people who go in and who go out. He had a facility to describe people, and the description ran several pages. It reminded me of Thomas Mann and the Buddenbrooks. It gave the background of the story, the smell, the atmosphere, the air, the grass, the sky. It \u2014 to me at age 17, 1t was very impressive."

I did not even know whether you could say a writer. I did not think that the stories would survive the war or we would survive the war, and then he began writing short poems, and I think there are eight or nine of them, and they were written to me. They were published after the war, and that\u2019s when he said, \u201cIf your mother were alive, I would ask her to marry you.\u201d He told me that he had a daughter, Eva, who died in the ghetto at not even a year old, and that\u2019s when I found out that he had a wife. He was separated from her. I saw once or twice. Somebody pointed her out. He had a couple of sisters, several brothers, and very, very old parents. They probably weren\u2019t as old as they looked old. The father could read and write Yiddish. The mother took in laundry for people before the war. She washed the laundry. She hung it up on the roof, and he had to sit on the roof to watch that the laundry wouldn\u2019t be stolen. The poverty in which he grew up was incredible. I had never heard of such poverty, and I believe that the apartment \u2014 and I was there twice \u2014 in which his parents lived, and the apartment which he shared during their time was theirs before the war. It was tiny. It was dark. There was hardly any furniture. It was the kind of poverty that you read about, but you never see it. By Spring or Summer in 43, I was taken to the common law police, severely beaten, and when I came back to the office, nobody said much, but I found out that I had been denounced for having a radio. The USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 74 Germans who beat me up told me that a woman had denounced me, and eventually being a ghetto and being a very small area, it became known that she had given my name to the common law police."

He kept bringing me back to Pawia, 26. He read me stories. He wrote more stories. And the following week he wrote a poem and he wrapped in an orange roll with a ribbon tied around, and the poem started \u201cThe eyes are green.\u201d The poem has been published in Israel and in Poland, and in one other book is a whole section and it says, \u201cFor Cilla.\u201d This friendship, I wouldn\u2019t call it a love affair. It was in between the two. On one hand, he was selfish. He got from Neftalin two weeks\u2019 leave to work in the bakery, which meant he could eat as much bread as he could absorb, but it also meant that his bread ration was not needed by him during the two weeks. I\u2019m sure it went to his family, but he never offered me a slice. It hurt. Then I moved to Lutomierska, and it was then that he told me that he had written a poem \u201cRaisins and Almonds\u201d. The poem was set to music by Beigelmann (ph). It was performed in the ghetto at night, clandestine in a basement. Rumkowski read about it because it says in one of the voices that \u201cWe are so hungry we have nothing to eat. What should the poor child do?\u201d Rumkowski took offense, and he threatened deportation, and he said, \u201cAs long as I am here, you will write no more.\u201d Neftalin intervened with the understanding and the promise that there would be no references to Rumkowski in anything and there weren\u2019t from that point forward. He hated the man with vengeance, and USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 75 he always said, \u201cIf you ever get to know him, be careful.\u201d I don\u2019t know how to translate it, probably the closest would be, \u201cHe is a pest,\u201d a parch in Yiddish."

            "question": "What kind of a person was Singer? Did you get to know him? USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 82",
            "answer": "Yes. Singer spent his day mainly on the street, or away from the office seeing people who had some knowledge, who had some influenced, who had important jobs. I would pick up at the bottom of the bridge in the police station from Sergeant Margolis the daily statistics \u2014 so many people died, so many people committed suicide, so many were deported. When Singer came back into the office, he would write or have us take notes and eventually, he produced a tremendous amount of material, because the chronicle of the large ghetto 1s not all Singer\u2019s. I think several hundred pages at least, and that\u2019s a forthcoming book now. He was a journalist. He had worked as a journalist in Prague. He had a tremendous insight, and normally, I was able to understand his writing except for one two-page \u2014 I couldn\u2019t even call it a report. It was more like a love letter to Rumkowski. If you want to read the German version, I can get it for you. It\u2019s available in Lodz and at the University in Giessen. It does not fit his personality. It does not fit his other reports. It does not fit the man because he very well knew and realized that, on some level, Rumkowski was collaborating. He followed orders. Whether he followed orders because he really believed it would buy us life or time, or whether he didn\u2019t have the courage to do anything else, because he made it very clear any kind of resistance would not be appreciated is a mild word, would not be tolerated. So, this last entry to Rumkowski could have only meant that he took it there and got some sort of a reward, which meant additional food, a loaf of bread, whatever. His daughter was my age and I met her through him, and his son was two or three years older, and he cultivated the girls whose father belonged to the police and to other important ghetto institutions. He worked in the bakery as an electrician. Strangely enough, Dr. Singer, a very educated man and so was his wife, did not send either one of his kids to college, and he could have because Prague was not Germany. Whether they would not have been college material, I really cannot judge. But USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 83 both had trades. The daughter was a seamstress and the son an electrician. The wife came from a German-speaking family in Prague, a very bright, very nice woman. His sister was in the ghetto. Her husband had been arrested after Prague was occupied, and one did not know his whereabouts, and she had a longstanding, ongoing connection with the director of the electrical component factory. And then there were two elderly ladies living in the same household. They had almost a small apartment on Zgierska Street. It was very clean and when I could not keep my bread for eight or nine days, I\u2019d give it to my friend, and she would bring me a portion to work everyday. So, I trusted her with my bread. What else can I say of the Singer? The two old ladies, especially one of them, was his landlady Roztoky, near Prague. No children, very wealthy. I think the husband died or was killed \u2014 or he died in the ghetto. In the ghetto, these two ladies made out a last will and testament in favor of Dr. Singer. I was, about six years ago, at Sonoma State University, and the director of Holocaust Studies is John Steiner. John is only very partly Jewish, but he made it through Auschwitz in spite of the fact that he never knew he was a Jew. It turns out that one of the ladies living with Dr. Singer was his aunt. He knew Dr. Singer before the war, and his daughter was his girlfriend. So, I told him the story about the will, and he\u2019s now \u2014 I mean, the will was lost in Auschwitz \u2014 he\u2019s trying to regain the house near park, and there was also a bank account by the same aunt in Switzerland, but the name and the numbers have never appeared. So, after 50 years, to come across this little old lady again 1s very strange. I found it in a way strange only it was resourceful that Dr. Singer asked the two ladies to make out their last will. On some level, he must have thought that he would survive the war, because otherwise, why would you do it? His son had, at times, a radio. It was in poor shape, it needed constant repair. We only got the BBC and the progress of the war \u2014 nothing about Warsaw, nothing USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 84 about our ghetto, nothing about Auschwitz, no idea. No mention was ever made by Dr. Singer of a place like Auschwitz, like Bergen-Belsen. No mention was made by Neftalin, by Spiegel. It just was not mentioned. So, it can be assumed that we really didn\u2019t know. Maybe somebody knew, but I don\u2019t know."

So, that is much later information. The work for Dr. Singer was effortless. It was boring. It was dull. I was a clerk. It was a large, dark office, and it was terribly lonely, whereas the previous office had people. Until one day when I got a phone call, would I please appear in police headquarters outside the Balutski Renneck (ph), and there was Rumkowsk1i, and he told me that I would work in the evening kitchen together with 40 other young women my age who had been for six months in the women\u2019s police corps, and they wore uniforms just like the men. They were mostly young women who had finished matura (ph) either before they ghetto or in the ghetto in 40, and they strutted around the ghetto in their police uniforms, gray with an orange band, and it was a police corps that lasted probably eight months."

You heard a rumor, true or untrue, that Biebow tried to rape Dora Fuchs. You heard \u2014 you heard all sorts of rumors in that office, some of which you didn\u2019t dare put down on paper because there was always the chance of censorship by the Germans, and censorship by the Jews. There were sometimes stories about food rations to be and they never materialized or vice versa. The information was accurate to the extent that you couldn\u2019t substantiate very much. I mean, even when I picked up the daily statistics, so many died in the hospital, so many jumped out of a window, of course, no births \u2014 there were hardly any births, even these statistics they were kept, but the question arises how accurate where they. There were quite a few suicides USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 87 especially from \u2014 committed by people coming from the west \u2014 some were doctors, some were lawyers, and they must have brought something along to make suicide possible. There was a rumor that the ghetto had some doctors. There was a lady by the name of Kronan Burke (ph). There was Dr. Miller, who was Rumkowski\u2019s favorite doctor, but no medication. There was a lady dentist who operated a drill with a foot pedal, like an old fashioned sewing machine, and you heard about them. You heard, for instance, that 1f you were jaundiced or if you had hepatitis, atropine would help, an injection of atropine. Whether this is true today, I do not know. Atropine could be somehow smuggled into the ghetto if you knew a German of the guard. These things you heard in the office, but you could never vouch for honesty or credibility."

On the outside, on the street corner, when the weather permitted. When it got very cold and I could spare the time, I would drop in at his room. He had a daughter about my age, a year older, and he would talk. He lived on, I think, Narutoviska (ph) Street before the war as did Sergei.

He tried to investigate. The first time the accusations were thrown out for lack of evidence by the Jewish Council. The second time was just before the start of the war. Supposedly, the complaint was filed. Rumkowski knew about it. Sergei escaped to Russia to \u2014 through Russia, I think he went to Yugahama (ph), then to Canada, then to Los Angeles. I met him in 1975. Rumkowski looked for him all through the war. He thought he was hiding in the ghetto. Sergei eventually went back to school and became a social worker, but while he was working on the city council, he worked in the Balut. He knew the thieves. He knew the thief in charge. He knew the underworld, and when his silver watch was stolen, he complained and it reappeared. There was a young woman in the ghetto. She also worked in the kitchen, and she once took me home, and I met her mother \u2014 a tall, well-dressed woman, heavyset, and the father is sort USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 94 of small and shifty-eyed gentleman, and he asked me where I come from and what my father did, and his only answer was, \u201cFeh\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to make of it. The apartment in the Balut had all the prewar furniture, rugs, glassware, crystal, and it turned out he had lived there before the war with his family as had my co-worker from the kitchen. She was very pretty, very blonde. I don\u2019t think she could count to five, but she was very popular. She had a couple of sisters, a brother-in-law, and when I asked the father, since he had such contempt for my father\u2019s work, what did he do before the war, he said, \u201cA little of this, and a little of that.\u201d But the rumor in the ghetto was that he had an older daughter and the daughter was sold to a brothel in South America. And it was common knowledge. But he had underworld connection before the war; during the war, I don\u2019t know. His children survived. What happened to the daughter in South America, I do not know.

I spent the whole rest of the war with his daughter partly with his wife. His wife died right after liberation of Bergen-Belsen. His sister survived and died in London.

            "answer": "The deportation was by street. The streets were posted which were off limits as part of the ghetto. My street was very early on the list. That meant if you did not vacate or if the Jews did not vacate that street, the Germans would take us out or shoot us. I\u2019m not sure which. So, you took whatever you could carry, and you vacated your rooms or room, and you could walk to the other side of the bridge if you knew somebody there and stay there for awhile if they would let you in, or you could go voluntarily to the railroad siding. I started walking and I knocked on Luba\u2019s door because she was on the other side. Her boyfriend answered the USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 113 door. I told him who I was, and he said in Polish and not very politely, \u201cGet lost.\u201d He didn\u2019t open the door. I knocked on another door. A friend \u2014 a coworker who was living with her elderly mother and whose boyfriend had died Warsaw of typhus, probably about 1940, but they shared the apartment with the captain of the Sonder police and his wife and I think a child, and when I knocked there, the captain from the other side of the door told me, \u201cYou either leave or...\u201d. So, I had no choice left but walk, and it was very warm, to the railroad siding in Marysin, and there were quite a lot of people milling around with their little bundles or suitcases. I had a little suitcase and my father\u2019s briefcase, and the briefcase held documents \u2014 papers, passports, whatever. And I saw to the left of me Oskar Singer and his family, and they said, \u201cCome on over. We\u2019ll go together.\u201d We stood there probably for a couple of hours in the heat. The Germans put up the ramp to the cattle car. We each received a piece of bread, a half a loaf of bread, some received a whole bread, and some received some sort of a sausage, but we did not \u2014 nothing to drink. We entered the cattle car, and I sat with Oskar\u2019s family in one corner. There were the two old ladies, Oskar and his wife, his two children, his sister, and I. And, when we asked him, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d He shrugged his shoulders. He said, \u201cProbably west for labor.\u201d That was the best guess. The cattle cars were closed from the outside, and they moved in stops and starts because there were other trains on the same siding that were given preference. Either they were prisoners from other areas or they were troop movements. We were never sure. We tried to yell over to a different car, but of course that doesn\u2019t work. We sat in these hot cattle cars. Some people cried. Some people fainted. There was a bucket in the corner. The bucket soon overflowed. You couldn\u2019t lie down. You could barely sit. And there was really no energy to think, \u201cWhat next? Where next?\u201d At one point, somebody spoke of jumping out of the car, but the doors never opened. USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 114 There was no jumping. The next time the door opened was four in the morning two days later with a concrete platform, brightly lit and dogs barking, and SS shouting commands. We scrambled out of the car, and we stood. They shouted orders, \u201cMen to the left. Women to the right.\u201d And I stood with the women, with the single women. Oskar and his son went to the other side. And they were soon marched off into the distance. We don\u2019t know where. We don\u2019t how they were separated again, because at this point there was no separation between young and old. We lined up, and I held the briefcase. I held onto that briefcase with the papers. Having grown up in Germany, papers are very important. And the command was shouted, \u201cDrop your belongings.\u201d Which meant a knapsack, a bag, whatever you had, but I wouldn\u2019t let go of the briefcase, and an SS walked towards my friend, Dr. Singer\u2019s daughter, and towards me and he shouted again and she took the briefcase and tore it out of my hand, and he shouted back, \u201cYou saved yourself a beating.\u201d"

The child was locked up while the parents went to work in the daytime. The child whined. The child was hidden behind a chimney during the selection, during the curfew for hours alone, and in Auschwitz, she stood behind us.

And there was a woman who recognized a mother who had been there a while, and she brought extra food, but that was already the next day. From there, they marched us those that were fit-looking or not elderly or not children anymore, into a barracks. We were asked to undress, drop all jewelry, fold the clothing neatly, and then they took us to another barracks and they shaved our hair, USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 116 and Dr. Singer\u2019s daughter asked, \u201cCouldn\u2019t we rather have a number?\u201d and, the answer was, \u201cHere you take what you get.

It looked so horrible that today I\u2019m asking myself, \u201cHow could I have been so stupid and so vain?\u201d But I was. We went into something called showers, into another barracks, and they were one adjacent to the other \u2014 without shoes, without clothing, and by then the grapevine had said something about gas and we looked at the showerheads and we didn\u2019t know what a gas chamber would look like and whether gas would come out of these things on the ceiling, and the little wetness dribbled down, very little, and we were pushed forward and we were each thrown one piece of clothing, whether it was a dress or a rag or a house robe, one piece, nothing else. One woman in our group was thrown a pair of Dutch wooden shoes, the rest of us were barefoot. It was hot in Auschwitz \u2014 being called out in the morning, it was freezing cold. Being called out in the afternoon, it was so hot that the rims of my ears were burning, my scalp was peeling. That\u2019s how hot it was. We were given a slice of bread a day and some brown liquid to drink, and in the evening there was supposed to be a soup but we were given no utensils. So, Alice, who had been in the ghetto, who had come from Vienna, took off her wooden clogs and we each took one of them, filled them with soup, drank the soup, and handed it to the next 1n line, but we guarded the shoes like you would guard Fort Knox.

We should put the dress over the right arm, and walked passed the three SS man as fast as possible, and one of them motioned with a stick or a riding whip, a leather whip, right left, right left.

I got a size eight USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 118 shoes; I wear a six. And we were put into cattle cars, and when they stopped two or three days later, I stood on Dr. Singer\u2019s daughter\u2019s shoulders and I looked out through the little slit in the cattle car, and I said, \u201cYou know what? We\u2019re near Hamburg.\u201d And then she went up and she looked and she said, \u201cNah, just green landscapes; nothing Hamburg here. You\u2019ve lost your mind. It\u2019s been hot too long.\u201d And the cattle car opens up, and we were housed in a warehouse of the outer harbor that housed Czech women on the other side. It housed some men from various occupied countries, and they were all used for forced labor in the Deutschebef Blomenforce (ph), the defense industry shipyards, cleaning up the bomb damage in and around Hamburg. And even Dessauer Ufer was not a concept because it was the address of a harbor area which to me had no meaning. It was not residential. But when they started us by truck or mainly in the subways in a corner, taking us to the worksites, and we had on these rags and across the rag was a yellow painted-on stripe, and underneath the fabric was cut out so you couldn\u2019t run away \u2014 no stars, no nothing. Some had a purple triangle, but very few. That I realized that indeed it was the surrounding of Hamburg, and for a minute I thought, \u201cSince I know the area, I could get away.\u201d But how? To whom? Where? Food? And then I realized that this was ridiculous. So, they then transferred us to another camp and in a now very fashionable area in Wedel where the mayor of the city lives, and there is one of these temporary houses left as a memorial, and we were guarded by 42 SS men and women. They needed people in the office to keep records of the SS personnel and of the people in the camp. There was a young lawyer from Poland, Sophie Kalishinska (ph) and I, we spoke German, who got sent to the office. We had the disadvantage that the commander of the camp came from Southern Germany and used to be a gardener in civilian life, was vicious. He would come in and he would kick us with his boots. We had bloody legs and USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 119 bloody arms, but for a while we didn\u2019t go out to work in the rain, but we took a daily beating. The SS women had no compassion, no understanding. There was no typewriter. Everything was written manually with a pencil, not with ink. I do not know why. Most of these SS people had been drafted late in the war; they had been civil service employees before the war. For the most part, they were uneducated. The women were vicious, some of them. The men \u2014 some were vicious, some were not so bad. They brought in three women from Prague to be in charge of the camp, to be kapos. They couldn\u2019t speak Polish, but they managed German, and the story of these three women is another story. They brought in one woman who was tiny, it\u2019s also another story. We couldn\u2019t tell how old she was. She probably was in her late \u201930s, but she ran around like a frightened mouse, and rumor had it that she was an MD by training. She came from Romania, and she was in charge of the hospital room, but nobody dared ever use it. It was used once for an abortion for a girl who became pregnant on the worksite, and Dr. Gisa and I met in the latrines where we would talk a few minutes, and then she would go her way and I would go my way. She had worked for Mengele in Auschwitz, and she did the abortions at night so the women could live and the babies died."

And the mother apologized for not having food, and the young woman who cleaned the barracks would come from Lodz with us. She was very small, very tiny, but very friendly and very obliging. She told her to lie down on the couch and she covered her up and she gave me a chair to sit on, but not a word was spoken. We had an hour of rest and nobody spoke.

I think that was the only kind gesture on the part of a German that I can recall. When they evacuated Sasel and put the gypsies there, they took us to Bergen-Belsen. Except for the overcrowded barracks and the dead bodies, I only remember two mountains of shoes at the gate, just empty shoes \u2014 old and new and worn, huge mountains, and what crossed my mind was, \u201cWhere are the feet?\u201d But it didn\u2019t matter anymore.

I was asked whether I would speak German or English, and I said English, and I had gotten a blouse and a brown skirt and I was driven in a staff car, in an English car. I don\u2019t remember the questions. I don\u2019t remember the answers. I don\u2019t know what I said \u2014 probably two hours. They thanked me, and they remained in prison, and a few weeks later I received little notes under the dormitory door where we were housed threatening my life. The first one was nothing. The second one was wotrisome, and the third one, I was hysterical. Three days later, the British drove me across the Dutch border into Belgium, into Brussels together with three other young women, and from Brussels to Lille, and the captain whose drive drove us. We went out for dinner in Lille and there wasn\u2019t much to eat in \u201945 in Lille, food was rationed. They had survived a war. We ate some chicken, but it tasted like leather. I forgot. He was engaged to a young woman. It turned out he was Jewish and he had been born in Berlin, and he put me on the train in Lille for Paris, and he gave me the address of the Centre de Coeur, the youth hostel, at quatre bis rue des Rosiers. The metro opened two hours after I arrived in Paris, and I saw a Polish officer in the army, and I asked him in Polish, \u201cWhich subway do I take? How do I get there?\u201d I had only been to Paris once as a child. I had no idea. And he told me and he accompanied me, and I was back in the dormitory youth hostel, but this time it was Paris \u2014 no food, the food was rationed. The little clothing I had I had to sell because I needed money. And I started visiting the American embassy. They saw me coming, \u201cThere she is again.\u201d I made a nuisance of myself. I\u2019ve never hated a place as much as I hated Paris at that point. It USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417 124 was no improvement except it had no Germans, but living was horrible. I met a young Hungarian woman there which is again, another story, who had been married in an Orthodox ceremony at age 12 to a young man, but it was a civil ceremony. It wasn\u2019t a chupah. That was to come later, but in the eyes of the law, she was the legal wife of that man who lived in Williamsburg, New York. She eventually married him in Williamsburg, but that\u2019s a totally different story. P\u2019ll mail you that story. And we lived six of us in that tiny corner on cots with an outhouse two stories down, and for a bath in Paris you had to pay 2 francs and go down the corner to the bathhouse. It was 1945, \u00b046."
