And, my mother \u0152 my father was already in Vienna a nd in Germany. My mother came from Sambor, Poland, because she was already in her late 20s, and there was no suitable suitor who came knocking. So, my grandmother sent her \u0152 she was the youngest of eight or ten children \u0152 to Cottbus hoping she would find a husband."

            "answer": "It was very predictable. It was very middle class. It was very secure. It was very unpretentious, although there was a maid for the children and a maid for the house, and we went on nice vacation. There were music less ons and English lessons and dancing lessons. But we took it for granted. My parents were rather strict \u0152 strict in terms of schooling, of grades, strict when I didn\u2122t practice violin. Children had to be seen but not heard. When my 3 parents discussed personal things or business events, they would speak Polish. I did not understand. When they talked to me and later on to my sister, it was in German. Occasionally, they would speak French, but not very often. It was \u0152 it was a nice childhood. The memories I have until 1933, when I was eight, are warm and they are loving. I really could not fault my parents for anything other than that were really very, very strict and very demanding. It was very important that a report card had an \ufb01A\ufb02, maybe a \ufb01B\ufb02, but anything below that was not acceptable."

            "answer": "Nothing would happen, but there would be reprimand, there would be a conference with the teacher, and after \u212233, when the grades slipped considerably, then there was a different tutor every afternoon \u0152 one for German, one for Math , one for English, one for French, and the grades did improve. What my parents did not consider was that the outside world had an influence on children. They told us that things would change. It would not remain this way. The neighbor\u2122s children would begin to play with us again. The boys would no longer beat us up on the way to school. It would \u0152 life would normalize. They didn\u2122t say exactly when, but they were very reassuring and very convinced that there would be a political change. And my parents, of course, could not vote in German elections. Th ey never became naturalized German citizens. They didn\u2122t want to. We went to Poland quite frequently to see the family, to see Grandmother, and what I heard in Poland as a very young child was that you, in Germany, are complaining about anti-Semitis m. You don\u2122t know what it\u2122s like in Poland. Your economic conditions do not compare to ours. To me, it did not make sense."

            "answer": "No. I could not comprehend. My grandmothe r spoke Polish. She spoke Yiddish to me, and I answered in German, but I really did not comp rehend. The family in Poland was well-off, but nothing compared to life in Germa ny. For instance, the streets in this little town were not \u0152 the streets were dirt streets, and when the peasants were pushing their wagons through the main street of the town, they took their shoe s off because it was muddy, and I could see their feet with the \u0152 with the mud oozing through the toes. When we arrived by train in Poland, we were picked up by a cousin with a horse and buggy. Well, I would not go into the buggy \u0152 not with a horse in front of it that was moving. I was used to a black taxi with white stripes. So, these things I remember. I remember them warmly. I \u0152 I remember that, and I appreciate that, I had a part of that culture, because it ended too soon."

How well the business did, I never knew. I was never told. I had a small allowance, probably of 50 cents a month. I didn\u2122t need anything, and I was not allowed to buy frivolous items. The clothing for the kids was custom made."

            "answer": "Middle class and upper-middle class it was custom made, yes. In those days, a man did not buy ready-made suits. There were hardly any. I went to a private Jewish school. The teachers were \u0152 at that time \u0152 in their late 50s, and to me terribly old. They were very strict and they 5 were very orthodox. You had to adhere to the rules and regulations. On Saturday, you didn\u2122t take a streetcar. You didn\u2122t write. You did not carry a purse. You pinned your handkerchief to your jacket. You learned Hebrew, post-modern Hebrew. You learned Humash and Gemora and you had to translate. It was mandatory, five days a week. School was not a happy experience. It was very rigid, very regimented, very German in spite of the fact that the teachers were all Jewish, very demandi ng and it lacked compassion, understanding for the children. We were told going home on the str eetcar to stand in the back, to be quiet, not to talk loudly, not to draw attention, and I remember sayi ng one day, \ufb01They want us to become invisible. How does one do that?\ufb02"

I could not understand what I had done to deserve the punishment of being beaten up on the street or having stones thrown at me or obscene names. I did not \u0152 I did not realize the impact, and I believed at th at point, that it would change."

            "answer": "They were very similar both in backgr ound, in education, in upbringing. I would say my mother was more reserved. She never contradicted my father. She agreed with all of his decisions. I think I can only recall two times when she disagreed. She came home one day and had cut off her long black hair which was ti ed to the top of her head, and she came home 6 with a fashionable bob. And the other thing she did \u0152 which was before I was born, but I heard the story \u0152 during the inflation, under the inflation of 1922, she pawned her silver to keep the business afloat, and she did not ask permission. After the business prospered, she of course got it back, but I think during the middle \u212230s, early \u212230s, she deferred him in all other decisions. I did not know at that time that my father bought commercial real estate. It was never mentioned. The decision was made betwee n my father and my mother\u2122s brother, younger brother, who was an associate, but we had no idea about it. We might have picked up a word or two, but we would have never asked. That wasn\u2122t done."

            "answer": "There were very few questions at the dinner table. The maid would sometimes bring in a dish or plates, and then the language would imme diately switch to Polish. We were asked questions about school, but not necessarily at the dinner table. It was when it came time to do homework, or when you wanted to postpone ho mework and the answer was, \ufb01No, homework first.\ufb02 It was a typical education of the \u212230s when you had to be within the role of a child, not have the freedom of being light-hearted or joking or tell funny stories. It wasn\u2122t done."

It gave us a sense of never missing anything. Anything that was necessary for a normal life or a sati sfactory life was provided. You didn\u2122t have to ask for it."

Yes, we played, even though there was a five-year difference. She was very fast, very bright, and very pretty, and when she started school, I had to listen, \ufb01Why can\u2122t you behave like your sister? Why can\u2122t you be as intelligent as your sister? Why do you have to talk out of turn? Why can\u2122t you bring home A\u2122s like your sister?\ufb02 And that was a little difficult."

Or, when it\u2122s later on, when the physics professor said, \ufb01Turn the Bunsen burne r on low,\ufb02 I turned it on high, and all the windows blew out, and my dad had to pay for new windows.

We saw the children in uniform, young children \u0152 white shirts, brown skirts or trousers, and sort of a brownish necktie. We did not see many other uniforms at that point.

Each precinct had a \u0152 each living area had a precinct and it was mandatory that when you moved into an apartment or into a house that you register at the precinct \u0152 name, address, occupation, tax id number, and religion. When you decided to move from A Street to B Street, you went back to the precinct. You told them where you\u2122re moving to. You went to the new precinct, and you went through the procedure again. This system still exists in Germany and in France, and this was probably on e of the reasons that you could keep tabs on people."

So, you\u2122re both invisible and not invisible at the same time.",

My grades slipped terribly, and that\u2122s when most of my spare time was occupied with tutors. The grades improved, but I don\u2122t think the happiness changed or the unhappiness changed. I would have like to leave the country like many of my school friends, but my parents saw no reason to leave because, in their eyes, we were former nationals.

We would hide things or play tricks on our parents, or when my mother was looking for a pair of shoes, and one shoe was missing. We sh ared a room. The two beds were divided.

And we moved to another apartment that was owned by a Jewish attorney in a not-so-nice area, but acceptable area, and all I remember of that apartment is that it had a tiny little ort hodox synagogue in the backyard. We never went there, but there was one, probably a hundred members at the most. The other thing I remember is that on November 10 th or 11th, we had a knock on the door at four in the morning, and there was my mothe r\u2122s brother and his son and his wife, and they had spent the night in a train from Cottbus to come to Ham burg to escape the arrest of all males which took place on the 10th of November.

Kashrut was observed, but I would say looking back probably not a hundred percent, only 80 percent, but as far as school was concerned, it was very orth odox. So, they tried not to upset me with giving me two sets of values \u0152 the more liberal value at home and the orthodox value at school, but yes, it was a religious household."

            "answer": "The Polish Consul in Hamburg was supp lied \u0152 was supposed to supply a stamp or a validation on all Polish passports, those of Jews and non-Jews, except there happened to be 15 no non-Jews. But, for some reason, he refused. Wh ether the reasons were anti-Semitic or not, he refused, and I only know of one or two cases where bribery worked, which was very unusual. The moment he refused to validate the passports, the Germans said, \ufb01You\u2122re no longer a valid foreign national living on German ground.\ufb02 At five-of-one in the morning, they rounded up \u0152 they came to our door. They rang the bell, and it was local police. And they said, \ufb01You have to come with me because of the matter of the stamps, and we take you to a schoolyard downtown.\ufb02 And my father said, \ufb01My wife just had surgery three months ago. Can she stay with the children?\ufb02 And my si ster and I stood in the hallway and listened, and since he was a local policeman, he said, \ufb01All right. You come with me, and I let the family stay.\ufb02 By afternoon, we heard by phone that this was done throughout the city, and they had rounded up several thousand people, or maybe in Hamburg alone it was not quite as much, and that they were held in a schoolyard, and somebody suggested that we bring my father a suitcase with some clothing. But they al so said for my mother not to go because they would keep her. She packed a suitcase and I insisted to take it down. It was heavy. I took public transportation. I took the subway \u0152 the underground and the above-ground, and I dragged that suitcase all the wa y down to the schoolyard. The gate was open and I started looking for my father, but there were a great many people \u0152 men, women and children, and he found me. I gave him the suitcase, and I re member distinctly saying to him, \ufb01Come home with me. The gate is open. There is no guard. There are no people. Just come home and we\u2122ll hide, or something.\ufb02 And my father looked at me and he said, \ufb01That wouldn\u2122t be the honorable thing to do.\ufb02 I did not understand what he meant, but my father played by the rules. When the law was published that you were not allowed to have foreign currency or to have currency in a foreign country, my father took the money th at was in Holland and 16 brought it back to Germany. So, you played by the rules, which I learned many years later that you don\u2122t have to. He could have just walked out. Nobody would have said a thing, and some people did, but very few. He was pushed over the border. The Poles pushed back, and the Germans pushed him in. They got to Zbaszyn, from Zbaszyn he went to Posen. He stayed there two months. He tried to come back to Germany. He couldn\u2122t get an entry visa, and he went to Sambor, to mother\u2122s family, and he stayed there until May 1940, no 1939, excuse me, when he got permission to come back fo r four weeks. In the meantime, my mother decided to liquidate the household and to ship all that was contained in an eight-room apartment in huge containers to Palestine, to my father\u2122s br other. She handled the shipping. She handled the packing. She handled the Gestapo who came to watch, and tried to approve every single item that went out of the country. She put a bottle of wine and two glasses on the table, and she refilled it with two or three more bottles, and they drank a great deal and we packed fast."

            "question": "The two Gestapo, not your mother?",
            "answer": "No, no, no. She just talked to the packers, \ufb01Hurry up, pack.\ufb02 We did not take anything of any particular value, just the furniture, clothing, linens and silverware, jewelry \u0152 whatever we normally had in the apartment, but the faster the better. The two crates were packed. They were picked-up, and they were shipped to Trieste. We, in the meantime, had to give up under new German laws the apartment and we were a ssigned to a room on Werd er Street Five. In the meantime, my father was granted permi ssion and he came back. I think the permission partly was through the intervention of my mother w ho hounded the Gestapo in the Staathaus 17 in Hamburg. She wrote. She went in. She talked to them. They threatened with arrest. She didn\u2122t give up. I never thought that a quiet, reserved woman would do what she did, and it absolutely amazed me. When my father came bac k, we started to work on an affidavit for the United States, and it certificate for Palestine. The four weeks ran out. My mother got an extension for another four weeks, and another four weeks, and one morning, on September 1st, the doorbell rang at five in the morning, six in the morning, and two men appeared with hats and long, black leather coats, and it was September. It was warm. And they asked for my father, and they said that Germany is at wa r with Poland. We have invaded Poland. You are an enemy alien, and you have to come with us . And that was the first day of the Second World War. He was first sent to a prison in Fuhlsb\u00fcttel, which late r became a concentration camp, and we were still allowed to bring every week a briefcase with laundry and take home a briefcase with dirty laundry for about two or three weeks, but Poland lost the war for all intents and purposes within two weeks. They had pockets of resistance, but not of war, and the moment that became a fact, my father wa s transported to Berlin to Oranienburg, to Sachsenhausen, and the mail stopped coming. It wa s sort of an aerogram with one sentence: \ufb01I\u2122m fine. I hope you are fine. Love, Ben.\ufb02 These letters became less and less frequent, until one arrived from Dachau. We had never heard of the place. My mother made, I would say, twice monthly trips to the Gestapo in Hamburg, in the Stathaus, pleading for release, trying to work for an exit visa, trying to work towards immigration papers, anyplace, writing a letter every week to the head of the Gestapo. The end result was that they brought my father to Gestapo headquarters for an hour\u2122s visit. He had on a grey and blue striped prison uniform and matching cap. We were sitting on opposite si des of the table, no touching. We talked but nobody could talk. My mother assured him sh e would try. It was a Catch-22. To go to 18 Shanghai, you had to have 400 American dollars , but you weren\u2122t allowed to have American currencies, and we had nobody who would give it to us. Our accounts had been blocked. Our money had been confiscated. We got a hundred dollars a month allowance to live on, no more. We had to move to the apartment next door, number seven. I still went to school. My sister still went to school. We went to the Jewish Community Council, who was headed at that time by a Doctor Plaut (ph). Doctor Plaut at that time was a man in his early 50s. He was unmarried. You had to wait for an audience, like you wait for the pope. We pleaded for papers because it was an emergency because somebody was sitting in a concentration camp, and he shrugged his shoulders and he said there was nothing he could do, but he became very well known for the fact that you could buy favors, but that was 1939, 1940. We heard rumors. He married a very much younger woma n with two young children, and he remained, as I\u2122m told, in Germany and was exchanged for a German I believe in Yugoslavia, pretty much into the war \u212243-\u212244. He ended up in Palestine. My father remained in Dachau and one man was released, and he had papers, first for Italy and then for Palestine, and my mother and I went to see him one evening after curfew , and we saw this six foot tall man who was a skeleton \u0152 no front teeth, shaven head \u0152 and when my mother asked him, \ufb01How is Benno?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Fine.\ufb02 He managed to leave Germ any with his wife and two children, and he promised to help once he would be outside. Goin g back to \u212239, when my father returned from Poland, he talked to the Italian Consul and they were on friendly terms, and he offered my father a three-day visa to Italy, and my father said, \ufb01And what do I do after the three days?\ufb02 And being Italian the man said, \ufb01Go, and wo rry later.\ufb02 My father wouldn\u2122t go. He was murdered in Dachau in February 1941. The Gestapo did something that the very rarely did. They brought us a cigar boxes with ashes. Whose ashes? We will never know. 19"

Somebody called the chief rabbi, which was Josef Carlebach, and it was an orthodox burial although it was not in accordance with law. And we never found out whether those are really his ashes. The body \u0152 the ashes were buried in the Jewish cemetery in Hamburg, and we managed to save some money and give it to a non-Jewish business acquaintance to set a stone, and the stone still stands.

I remember my old fashioned record pl ayer the Andrew Sisters. I remember some American jazz, which was not permitted, but fo r five dollars you could have a copy made on a wax platter. So, we learned to dance swing, which was the latest rage. There were even fashion trends. The boys would wear trench coats and those sloppy hats with the wide brim. The girls would wear pleated skirts and thick rubber soles, white or beige rubber soles. That was the style. Stockings were no longer available so you painted your legs and you put a black line on the back. Silk stockings were unobtainable. And if you had a pair, you had them forever repaired. Clothing coupons Jews did not get. If there was clothing available in the store, we couldn\u2122t buy it. The children or the young people did not mind. It wasn\u2122t that important.

So, there is a lot of damage. It\u2122s a matter of degree. I think we all sustained some, more or less, but it\u2122s strange that it took 60 years to surface. There were no social workers.

            "answer": "I saw the German soldiers lined up. The railro ad cars were opened. We were ordered to come out. We were ordered to line up in rows of fi ve, and we saw a whole group of men in black jackets, black trouser, a black hat with an orange band, an orange arm band with the Star of David, and on their jackets were also yellow stars. The Germans handed us over to these men. The name given to them was \ufb01ghetto po lice\ufb02. The ground was sandy. It was dirty. It was not a railroad station. We saw a wagon drawn by two horses and our suitcases were thrown on that wagon. The Germans went back into the trains, and the ghetto police explained to us \u0152 mostly in Polish, and hardly anybody spoke Polish \u0152 that we had to walk 43 into the ghetto. My mother, who stood next to me, asked the first available policeman in Polish, \ufb01Where are we? What is the ghetto? What \u2122s going on?\ufb02 And on the hour and a half or two-hour walk, and it was very warm and there were many elderly people, he explained to my mother that it was the city of L\u00f3dz, whic h was familiar to her. It was the ghetto, which was an area that was totally enclosed. And as we kept on walking, we saw people that didn\u2122t look at us. They looked ragged. They looked tired. They looked ill-f ed and ill-dressed. And we saw buildings that were dilapidated. Some were \u0152 some stre ets were paved; others were not. We saw no vehicles. We saw no automobiles. We saw no trucks. But he explained to my mother, and she translated, that the ghetto wa s an area that was fenc ed in and guarded by Germans. There was no into the ghetto; there was no out of the ghetto. And my mother made a very flippant remark, \ufb01Well, if you want to get out of this situation, you always can.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Hardly.\ufb02 They walked us to a school on Mlynarska Street. This school evidently had been abandoned, and they housed all 1,100 of us on two, possibly three, stories in what used to be classrooms, lecture rooms. We even tually got our suitcases. We put our coats or whoever had a blanket on the floor, and that\u2122s how we lived for six weeks. The Jewish ghetto administration sent in a kitchen detail once a day to bring soup. This soup was mainly water, very little else. In the mornings, we received sometimes a slice of bread and a liquid that was bitter tasting and supposed to look like coffee, but it had a grainy substance. It had no coffee. And at that point, most of us still had some money, which we had brought from Germany. Some of it sewn into shoulder pads, into belt s, into shoes. And those of us who had some money \u0152 some more, others less \u0152 you could go into the courtyard and the people who had lived in the ghetto since 1940 when it was first closed would sell out of newspaper a little piece of bread, a chunk of margarine, anything ed ible, and we would buy it with this German 44 money, not realizing that the currency in the ghetto was not German money. It was special ghetto-printed money similar to Monopoly mo ney, and that we were by far overpaying. When we ran out of the money, we would sell some of our so-called \ufb01western\ufb02 belongings \u0152 a silk blouse, a silk scarf, an alligator purse \u0152 whatever any family had brought along and it was deemed no longer necessary, superfluous, and it brought in some food. These things were not sold for money. They were bartered for food. I remember seeing my mother in the courtyard bartering for bread and margarine against a silk blouse."

It had to last at that point a week, and we cut it into seven or eight wedges once we got our permanent food rations. And I took my mother\u2122s example, and I had a purse. And when she did not realize it, I did the same thing. I traded the purse for some bread. It was traded to a young woman a little older than I was, who came with a very good-looking gentleman probably ten years older who ha d a briefcase, and he wanted to give me one piece of bread and I said, \ufb01It\u2122s too little.\ufb02 And they laughed. They didn\u2122t speak German and I didn\u2122t speak Polish, but we managed. A nd I stood there for two hours and eventually they came back and I got two pieces of bread. But even that had limitation because you ran out of tradable goods. Nobody had jewelry. That had to be left for the Germans. And what was left was really the bare essentials, not more than that. After six weeks, we were assigned to various rooms."

            "answer": "There was a pump in the courtyard, a nd if you knew somebody with either a bowl or a bucket, you would borrow it. In the beginning, we had some soap, but you use up soap and then you make do without soap. This school had outhouses in the backyard. The outhouses were used by 1,100 people. They were filthy. They were unsanitary. People got sick. There were accidents. You washed and we used to call it a cat\u2122s wash because you really couldn\u2122t wash. There was no privacy. There was no place. There was no room. I remember standing in a corner holding up a blanket. My mother was behind the blanket washing and vice versa. So, sanitary conditions didn\u2122t exist. At night, we slept on the floor. In the daytime, we sat on the floor. Crowded, one body next to the other. And eventually, six weeks later, we were assigned to various rooms througho ut the ghetto on both sides of the bridges. The older part of the ghetto was the Balut, the former slum of the city. It used to house Jews and non-Jews, but had been vacated for Jews only. We were fortunate enough to be settled in the little newer section on the front side of the bridge. We shared a probably 10 by 10 foot room with four other people. We had two or three wooden cots. My mother brought a little wardrobe so we didn\u2122t have to hang the clothing on the damp walls. The view out of the window was a barbed wire and the red century house with a German marching up and down. So, we did not go near the window. At night, you had to put a black sheet over the window so no light could come out because it was wartime. And the room had a little cast iron stove, but there was no lumber. We slowly took out of the wooden cots on e board at a time, cut it up for heat and for cooking. We were issued ration cards, and the food distribution centers were throughout the ghettos. The intervals of the spaces between them were several kilometers. When a food ration was announced or posted on the walls, it gave a date when it would be available, and how much, and what items. You had to bring yo ur own containers, and during the first week, 46 you stood in line for about three hours until you got your food. If you waited beyond that, there were no more lines but sometimes the food ran out."

You had to carry a bucket up and a bucket down with dirty water. There were no bathrooms. The toilets were outhouses in the backyard. There were no showers. There were no bathtubs. There was no transportation within the ghetto to get from one place to another. There was an internal police force. There was a fire brigade. I don\u2122t think it was ever used, and aside from the police force there was a Sonder force, that meant special police with special orders, with more difficult tasks which larger, with larger food allotmen ts, and some of these men were decent, and some were brutal."

It never really occurred to us that most buildings would not have a bathroom. I thought there would be maybe a bathroom on each floor or a shower. The ghetto did have a bathhouse, but you needed a coupon to get in. The ghetto had a laundry. Once I had a coupon and I bought some sheets, and it took me six mont hs to get them back.

            "answer": "We did at first, and then one evening we had knock at the door. It must have been around January. And in walked a short little man by the name of Ad olf Goetz, and he had lived around the corner from us in Hamburg on Holle Street. We lived on Braumsen Way (ph). We didn\u2122t know him but we\u2122d wave from the back window. He had a short little wife with very curly hair and she used to shake out her rugs off the balcony. And he came in with another man and he used to be a dentist in Ha mburg. I think it was Rosenblum. And he had remembered us and he said to my mother, \ufb01I have been given permission to open an office. Would you allow your daughter to work in that office?\ufb02 My mother said, \ufb01Sure.\ufb02 \ufb01Well, she doesn\u2122t get much money. You know how it is, but she\u2122ll get a daily soup.\ufb02 Adolph Goetz had a terrific sense of humor. He was probably not ev en five foot tall. He wore glasses, and he had a funny face that you would expect to see in a cartoon, a very pinched little face. He had been a playwright. He had been an engineer. He had a son in South America some place, and he convinced Rumkowski that the ghetto ne eded improvement and beautification. And he hired probably a dozen architects and engineers that had come from Prague on this so-called Intelligenz transport, as they called themselves because everybody had a college degree, among them the general director of Schoda (ph), which was Dr. Reich. And they were supposed to draw up blue prints with parks, with schools, with trees, with playgrounds. And I was supposed to do some typing, but I couldn\u2122t type very well, and write the explanations to these blueprints. And every once in a while Adolph Goetz would take the blueprints to Balutaring, to Rumkowski, and Rumkowski seemed enthused. And we got the midday soup. 57 The office was on Rybn, 8. And oh, Adolph must have been in his late \u212260s at a guess, and for fun he wrote poems and he wrote stories. A nd he would make little airplanes out of them, and just sort of fly them over the office onto my desk. That went on for several months. I didn\u2122t know what to make it, but it was sort of funny. But he complained bitterly about the lack of food, but the office remained for a bout six months, and then he was summoned by Rumkowski, and he was told, \ufb01I\u2122m terminati ng the office. I\u2122m closing down the office. And all of you can look for other jobs.\ufb02 In the meantime, he had gotten double rations, which of course I didn\u2122t know. And he was really unhappy for himself and for us, as well. And everybody tried to get a job someplace else. Dr. Reich went to work for the lumber department for Goodman. Some others found employment some place else, and by then it was July. And my mother died on the 30 th of July 1942 of hunger."

We did not hear. My sister and I walked to the Jewish cemetery in Marysin, about a two-hour walk. And in the burial hall, we went through hundreds of bodies. And most bodies were between two boards, wooden boards, tied together with a string and a name tag. We found my mother\u2122s body. And we took two shovels. And we looked for a plot and there were no more plots left on the cemetery. So, we found a walkway, and we spent that July day digging a grave until it was deep enough to bury her. We put a wooden marker on it. We scratched the name with a stone on the marker, and we walked back. Fr om that day on, I think, my sister stopped talking."

And I was asked by the directors of the factories, \ufb01If I give you a place for your sister, what will you give me in return?\ufb02 And I explained that I had no jewelry nor did I have money. And the answ er was laughter. I did not comprehend. In the end, I did find her a place. I asked her if she enjoyed it, if she learned Polish, if there were other children \u0152 she wouldn\u2122t answer. And, I, in the meantime, looked for work. I found some work in the factory sewing ladies\u2122 dresse s, but it was a two hour walk to Marysin. And I worked at a machine for a while. And the in teresting part in that factory was that it employed young people my age, a little older, an d they were very intent on striking, on asking for more food. One young woman named Fajg a made us walk, those willing to walk, around the courtyard, \ufb01No food. No work.\ufb02 It took an hour, and the police \u0152 the Jewish ghetto police \u0152 came into the cour tyard and took her away.

            "num": 299,
            "question": "Okay.",
            "answer": "The essence of the speech was that the Germans had demanded 20,000 sick, elderly, and children, most of them children to be sent out of the ghetto. And the wording of the speech was, and that I think is a matter of record, \ufb01M others and fathers, give me your children so that the rest of us may live and survive.\ufb02 There were outcries, maybe a stone or two were thrown, but police was present. He tried to ex plain that he tried to negotiate that they wouldn\u2122t take children over 11 years of age, but they would have to take the sick. He got the number decreased by a thousand and various other justifications. Those who heard the speech and those who found about it were appalled. It was \u0152 the concept was unthinkable. During the process, that the deportation was announced by Rumkowski, and by the time he had the lists on the streets of the people written up, the Germans got angry and impatient. They enforced a curfew of seven days starting in September, I believe it was the 7th. We were not supposed to be out on the street for seven days and seven nights. The Germans came into the ghetto with trucks, with dogs and with guns. They went from street to street and from house to house, and the square area of the ghetto was not very large. And it went house by house. They came to our street. We had a neighbor si t on the roof and look out. And when they entered the courtyard, they shouted for everybody to assemble in the courtyard. And then they went into the building and found those who had hidden. They beat them and put them on 64 the truck. And then the looked at the remainder of those standing in the courtyard, probably 60 people, and within five minutes, they sepa rated the old and the young from the more fit human beings. My sister, although she was 11 y ears old, not 10, was taken. I tried to go onto the truck with her. The guns stopped me. The truck drove off. My neighbor\u2122s mother was taken \u0152 many people out of the building. He was a policeman. He couldn\u2122t get his mother released. We never found out where they were taken, what was done with them, where they supposedly were resettled, in what labor camp they might have been sent. But eventually, a few packages of clothing came back into the ghetto. And supposedly \u0152 I did not see it \u0152 some of the clothing was blood-stained. Actual notes or actual letters I don\u2122t believe were found. Nobody could give us an answer. We hoped that they were alive \u0152 someplace, somewhere. And the curfew was lifted after seven days, and life continued for the rest of us. It was almost as if we had been hypnotized, as if we just \u0152 we just went on. We went to work. We collected the soup. We collected the food ration. It continued. We had been robbed not of our children, but of our feelings, of our compassion. Some children were hidden, but very few. How he could have asked to hand over the children, I did not understand at 16. I don\u2122t understand it now. Did he have a choice? I would say so. C zerniakow had a choice. I mean, his life was not so precious that he could not have said no. He could have refused to obey the orders. He would have paid the price, but to ask this of the community is unthinkable. I was fired from the dress factory. I don\u2122t know for what reason, probably incompetence. I did not sew very well. And I went back to the office on Rybna, 8 because I knew a woman there from Vienna. And by then it was October, and it was cold, and we stood around the stove and I said, \ufb01I need a job desperately.\ufb02 And her boss, who sat a desk in the corner, came over. He started talking to me, and by then I spoke Polish and Yiddish, and he said, \ufb01I\u2122ll give you a job.\ufb02 I 65 said, \ufb01Doing what?\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01We have recei ved truckloads of forms to be completed for the Germans in Germany for their coal rati ons. And the forms have to be figured and completed. And you\u2122ll sit in the office. I need 300 people. You write down the names. People will tell you they\u2122ll work here. Y ou just get their addresses, and you just do it.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Okay, I\u2122ll do it. A job is a job.\ufb02 His boss was Henryk Neftalin, the attorney, who was in his late 30s. A very fair man. A very able man. I had me t his mother when I was running around with those passports a year earlier. And he was much admired. The strange thing was that he had Rumkowski\u2122s ear. When he would go to Rumkowsk i, he might take some abuse, but in the end, he would argue. And half the time, Rumk owski would listen. So, he was much admired. His girlfriend worked in one of the administrative offices. Her name was Klatalka (ph). And I worked in that office, I would say, until \u212243, end of \u212243. And one day Bernard Fuchs decided \u0152 he was the head of the Department of Labor \u0152 that too many people worked in that office, and he needed people in the straw shoe factory for the Russian front. And the commission of several dignitaries came, among them Rumkowski. And it was ag ain a selection of who goes and who stays. And I hid pretty much to the bitter end until I was called, because they had my name on the list. And Rumkowski sat on a ch air. He had taken off his hat and his coat, and he had his cane in his right hand. And for a minute, he reminded me of a fairy tale \u0152 a king sitting on a throne. He spoke to me in Yiddish and he as ked me my name, whether I had family, where I had come from, and in the e nd he said, \ufb01Little German, you may stay, and you\u2122ll hear from me.\ufb02 He took a lot of people out of that office at that particular time. Bernard Fuchs threw out the list as he had drawn up previous deportation lists. I had gone to his office when I was jobless and asked hi m for employment because he was born in Hannover, Germany, and he spoke German. And after my third visit, he lost his temper, and 66 he said that he had not jobs, that I was a pest, or the equivale nt in Polish. He opened the door and he yelled like a German, \ufb01 Raus!\ufb02"

And there were many that were capable, that were intelligent, but they wouldn\u2122t hire a woman. That was competition \u0152 a man, yes \u0152 a woman, no. So, I went back to work, and a few weeks later, my boss Henryk Neftalin called me into his office and he said, \ufb01I\u2122m transfer ring you to the Statistical Department on Plac Koscielny, 4.\ufb02 I didn\u2122t want to leave because I\u2122d become very friendly with Spiegel and I did not like the unknown.

It could have been the fact that I came to work one day with a very bloody face when I had been sent to the Kripo because somebody 67 said I had a radio, and I never did have a radio. And he saw my bloody scars, my bloody face, my bruised eyes. He transferred me because in essence he was the actual head of the Statistical Department. He had the first word and the last word. It was a long way to work over the bridge. And in winter it was hard to walk, so they unshoveled snow on the bridge. You slid back rather than forward. Hundreds of people cross the bridge every morning, and you were afraid that somebody would carry lice and they would jump over on your clothing. That was the greatest fear because they carried typhus. The office\u2013"

And, just for the deportation, the father was so hungry that he stole a piece of the children\u2122s bread. And the father was deported.

I did not even know whether you could say a writer. I did not think that the stories would survive the war or we would survive the war, and then he began writing short poems, and I think there are eight or nine of them, and they were written to me. They were published after the war, and that\u2122s when he said, \ufb01If your mother were alive, I would ask her to marry you.\ufb02 He to ld me that he had a daughter, Eva, who died in the ghetto at not even a year old, and that\u2122s when I found out that he had a wife. He was separated from her. I saw once or twice. Somebody pointed her out. He had a couple of sisters, several brothers, and very, very old parents. They probably weren\u2122t as old as they looked old. The father could read and write Yiddish. The moth er took in laundry for people before the war. She washed the laundry. She hung it up on the roof, and he had to sit on the roof to watch that the laundry wouldn\u2122t be stolen. The poverty in which he grew up was incredible. I had never heard of such poverty, and I believe that the apartment \u0152 and I was there twice \u0152 in which his parents lived, and th e apartment which he shared during their time was theirs before the war. It was tiny. It was dark. There was hardly any furniture. It was the kind of poverty that you read about, but you never see it.

The 74 Germans who beat me up told me that a wo man had denounced me, and eventually being a ghetto and being a very small area, it became known that she had given my name to the common law police."

He kept bringing me back to Pawia, 26. He read me stories. He wrote more stories. And the followi ng week he wrote a poem and he wrapped in an orange roll with a ribbon tied around, and the poem started \ufb01The eyes are green.\ufb02 The poem has been published in Israel and in Po land, and in one other book is a whole section and it says, \ufb01For Cilla.\ufb02 This friendship, I wouldn\u2122t call it a love affair. It was in between the two. On one hand, he was selfish. He got from Neftalin two weeks\u2122 leave to work in the bakery, which meant he could eat as much bread as he could absorb, but it also meant that his bread ration was not needed by him during the two weeks. I\u2122m sure it went to his family, but he never offered me a slice. It hurt. Then I move d to Lutomierska, and it was then that he told me that he had written a poem \ufb01Raisins and Almonds\ufb02. The poem was set to music by Beigelmann (ph). It was performed in the ghe tto at night, clandestine in a basement. Rumkowski read about it because it says in one of the voices that \ufb01We are so hungry we have nothing to eat. What should the poor child do?\ufb02 Rumkowski took offense, and he threatened deportation, and he said, \ufb01As long as I am here , you will write no more.\ufb02 Neftalin intervened with the understanding and the promise that th ere would be no references to Rumkowski in anything and there weren\u2122t from that point fo rward. He hated the man with vengeance, and 75 he always said, \ufb01If you ever get to know him, be careful.\ufb02 I don\u2122t know how to translate it, probably the closest would be, \ufb01He is a pest,\ufb02 a parch in Yiddish."

            "answer": "Yes. Singer spent his day mainly on the street, or away from the office seeing people who had some knowledge, who had some influenced, who had important jobs. I would pick up at the bottom of the bridge in the police station fr om Sergeant Margolis the daily statistics \u0152 so many people died, so many people committed suic ide, so many were deported. When Singer came back into the office, he would write or have us take notes and eventually, he produced a tremendous amount of material, b ecause the chronicle of the large ghetto is not all Singer\u2122s. I think several hundred pages at least, and that\u2122s a forthcomin g book now. He was a journalist. He had worked as a journalist in Prague. He had a tremendous insight, and normally, I was able to understand his writing except for one two-page \u0152 I couldn\u2122t even call it a report. It was more like a love letter to Rumkowski. If you want to read the German version, I can get it for you. It\u2122s available in Lodz and at the University in Giessen. It does not fit his personality. It does not fit his other reports. It does not fit the man because he very well knew and realized that, on some level, Rumkowski was collaborating. He followed orders. Whether he followed orders because he really believed it would buy us life or time, or whether he didn\u2122t have the courage to do anything else, because he made it very clear any kind of resistance would not be appreciated is a mild word, would not be tolerated. So, this last entry to Rumkowski could have only meant that he to ok it there and got some sort of a reward, which meant additional food, a loaf of bread, whatever. His daughter was my age and I met her through him, and his son was two or three ye ars older, and he cultivated the girls whose father belonged to the police and to other im portant ghetto institutions. He worked in the bakery as an electrician. Strangely enough, Dr. Singer, a very educated man and so was his wife, did not send either one of his kids to college, and he could have because Prague was not Germany. Whether they would not have been college material, I really cannot judge. But 83 both had trades. The daughter was a seamstress and the son an electrician. The wife came from a German-speaking family in Prague, a ve ry bright, very nice woman. His sister was in the ghetto. Her husband had been arrested after Prague was occupied, and one did not know his whereabouts, and she had a longstanding, ongoing connection with the director of the electrical component factory. And then there were two elderly ladies living in the same household. They had almost a small apartment on Zgierska Street. It was very clean and when I could not keep my bread for eight or nine days, I\u2122d give it to my friend, and she would bring me a portion to work everyday. So, I trusted her with my bread. What else can I say of the Singer? The two old ladies, especial ly one of them, was his landlady Roztoky, near Prague. No children, very wealthy. I think the husband died or was killed \u0152 or he died in the ghetto. In the ghetto, these two ladies made out a last will and testament in favor of Dr. Singer. I was, about six years ago, at Sonoma State University, and the director of Holocaust Studies is John Steiner. John is only very partly Jewish, but he made it through Auschwitz in spite of the fact that he never knew he was a Je w. It turns out that one of the ladies living with Dr. Singer was his aunt. He knew Dr. Singer before the war, and his daughter was his girlfriend. So, I told him the story about the will, and he\u2122s now \u0152 I mean, the will was lost in Auschwitz \u0152 he\u2122s trying to regain the house n ear park, and there was also a bank account by the same aunt in Switzerland, but the name a nd the numbers have never appeared. So, after 50 years, to come across this little old lady ag ain is very strange. I found it in a way strange only it was resourceful that Dr. Singer asked the two ladies to make out their last will. On some level, he must have thought that he w ould survive the war, because otherwise, why would you do it? His son had, at times, a radio. It was in poor shape, it needed constant repair. We only got the BBC and the progres s of the war \u0152 nothing about Warsaw, nothing 84 about our ghetto, nothing about Auschwitz, no idea. No mention was ever made by Dr. Singer of a place like Auschwitz, like Bergen-B elsen. No mention was made by Neftalin, by Spiegel. It just was not mentioned. So, it can be assumed that we really didn\u2122t know. Maybe somebody knew, but I don\u2122t know."

So, th at is much later information. The work for Dr. Singer was effortless. It was boring. It was dull. I was a clerk. It was a large, dark office, and it was terribly lonel y, whereas the previous office had people. Until one day when I got a phone call, would I please appear in police headquarters outside the Balutski Renneck (ph), and there was Rumkowski, and he told me that I would work in the evening kitchen together with 40 other young wome n my age who had been for six months in the women\u2122s police corps, and they wore uni forms just like the men. They were mostly young women who had finished matura (ph) either before they ghetto or in the ghetto in \u212240, and they strutted around the ghetto in their police uniforms, gray with an orange band, and it was a police corps that lasted probably eight months."

You heard a rumor, true or untrue, that Biebow tried to rape Dora Fuchs. You heard \u0152 you heard all sorts of rumors in that office, some of which you di dn\u2122t dare put down on paper because there was always the chance of censorship by the German s, and censorship by the Jews. There were sometimes stories about food rations to be and they never materialized or vice versa. The information was accurate to the extent that you couldn\u2122t substantiate very much. I mean, even when I picked up the daily statistics, so many di ed in the hospital, so many jumped out of a window, of course, no births \u0152 there were hardly any births, even these statistics they were kept, but the question arises how accurate where they. There were quite a few suicides 87 especially from \u0152 committed by people coming from the west \u0152 some were doctors, some were lawyers, and they must have brought something along to make suicide possible. There was a rumor that the ghetto had some docto rs. There was a lady by the name of Kronan Burke (ph). There was Dr. Miller, who was Rumkowski\u2122s favorite doctor, but no medication. There was a lady dentist who operated a drill with a foot pedal, like an old fashioned sewing machine, and you heard about them. You heard, fo r instance, that if you were jaundiced or if you had hepatitis, atropine would help, an injection of atropine. Whether this is true today, I do not know. Atropine could be somehow smuggle d into the ghetto if you knew a German of the guard. These things you heard in the o ffice, but you could never vouch for honesty or credibility."

Supposedly, the complaint was filed. Rumkowski knew about it. Sergei escape d to Russia to \u0152 through Russia, I think he went to Yugahama (ph), then to Canada, then to Los Angeles. I met him in 1975. Rumkowski looked for him all through the war. He thought he was hiding in the ghetto.

I mean, they counted it, and once in a while, there were ten strips to a unit. Once in awhile, we were a strip short, and then you had to go to the foreman, who was a young man our age and you had to do a lot of explaining and a lot of excusing, and then you would get another strip, but they were counted out carefully because the Germans had shipped them carefully. The reason my strips disappeared is I stole them. I stole six strips because my s hoes had no soles, and I put them in the top of my boots, and I walked through the inspection; it was like at the airport. They would tap you from neck to the bottom. Occas ionally you had to undress, and I only told about it after I had all six out. Nobody knew, and people thought I must have lost my mind, but I had no soles for the winter."

One makes the uppers are the kupita (ph), and the bottom is the shaftsa (ph), and it\u2122s two pro cedures. It\u2122s like a designer, designing the upper part, and then putting the sole on it. And the reason I got them made was that I left them have the box, half the hatbox because it had a top and a bottom. The side were sort of stiff, and \u0152 but they only lasted one winter or maybe a winter and a half and I came through the soles, and I had frostbite, and they were pull up boots in sort of a nice brown leather, but much too soft for shoes.

            "answer": "The deportation was by street. The streets were posted which were off limits as part of the ghetto. My street was very early on the list. That meant if you did not va cate or if the Jews did not vacate that street, the Germans would take us out or shoot us. I\u2122m not sure which. So, you took whatever you could carry, and you vacated your rooms or room, and you could walk to the other side of the bridge if you knew somebody there and stay there for awhile if they would let you in, or you could go voluntarily to the railroad siding. I started walking and I knocked on Luba\u2122s door because she was on the other side. Her boyfriend answered the 113 door. I told him who I was, and he said in Poli sh and not very politely, \ufb01Get lost.\ufb02 He didn\u2122t open the door. I knocked on another door. A friend \u0152 a coworker who was living with her elderly mother and whose boyfriend had died Warsaw of typhus, probably about 1940, but they shared the apartment with the captain of the Sonder police and his wife and I think a child, and when I knocked there, the captain from the other side of the door told me, \ufb01You either leave or...\ufb02. So, I had no choice left but walk, and it was very warm, to the railroad siding in Marysin, and there were quite a lot of people milling around with their little bundles or suitcases. I had a little suitcase and my father\u2122s brief case, and the briefcase held documents \u0152 papers, passports, whatever. And I saw to the left of me Oskar Singer and his family, and they said, \ufb01Come on over. We\u2122ll go together.\ufb02 We stood there probably for a couple of hours in the heat. The Germans put up the ramp to the cattle car. We each received a piece of bread, a half a loaf of bread, some received a whole bread, and some received some sort of a sausage, but we did not \u0152 nothing to drink. We entered the cattle car, and I sat with Oskar\u2122s family in one corner. There were the two old ladies, Oskar and his wife, his two children, his sister, and I. And, when we asked him, \ufb01Where are we going?\ufb02 He shrugged his shoulders. He said, \ufb01Probably west for labor.\ufb02 That was the best guess. The cattle cars were closed from the outside, and they moved in stops and starts because there were other trains on the same siding that were give n preference. Either they were prisoners from other areas or they were troop movements. We were never sure . We tried to yell over to a different car, but of course that doesn\u2122t work. We sat in these hot cattle cars. Some people cried. Some people fainted. There was a bucket in the corner. The bucket soon overflowed. You couldn\u2122t lie down. You could barely sit. And there was really no energy to think, \ufb01What next? Where next?\ufb02 At one point, somebody spoke of jumping out of the car, but the doors never opened. 114 There was no jumping. The next time the door op ened was four in the morning two days later with a concrete platform, brightly lit and dogs barking, and SS shouting commands. We scrambled out of the car, and we stood. They s houted orders, \ufb01Men to the left. Women to the right.\ufb02 And I stood with the women, with the si ngle women. Oskar and his son went to the other side. And they were soon marched off into the distance. We don\u2122t know where. We don\u2122t how they were separated again, because at this point there was no separation between young and old. We lined up, and I held the briefcas e. I held onto that briefcase with the papers. Having grown up in Germany, papers are very important. And the command was shouted, \ufb01Drop your belongings.\ufb02 Which mean t a knapsack, a bag, whatever you had, but I wouldn\u2122t let go of the briefcase, and an SS walked towards my friend, Dr. Singer\u2122s daughter, and towards me and he shouted again and she took the briefcase and tore it out of my hand, and he shouted back, \ufb01You saved yourself a beating.\ufb02"

And there was a woman who recognized a mother who had been there a while, and she brought extra food, but that was already the next day. From there, they marched us those that were fit-looking or not elderly or not children anymore, into a barracks. We were asked to undress, drop all jewelry, fold the clothing neatly, and then they took us to another barracks and they shaved our hair, 116 and Dr. Singer\u2122s daughter asked, \ufb01Couldn\u2122t we rather have a number?\ufb02 and, the answer was, \ufb01Here you take what you get.

It looked so horrible that today I\u2122m asking myself, \ufb01How coul d I have been so stupid and so vain?\ufb02 But I was. We went into something called showers, into another barracks, and they were one adjacent to the other \u0152 without shoes, without clothing, and by then the grapevine had said something about gas and we looked at the showerheads and we didn\u2122t know what a gas chamber would look like and whether gas would come out of these things on the ceiling, and the little wetness dribbled down, very little, and we were pushed forward and we were each thrown one piece of clothing, whether it was a dress or a rag or a house robe, one piece, nothing else. One woman in our group was thrown a pair of Dutch wooden shoes, the rest of us were barefoot. It was hot in Auschwitz \u0152 being called out in the morning, it was freezing cold. Being called out in the afternoon, it was so hot that the rims of my ears were burning, my scalp was peeling. That\u2122s how hot it was. We were given a slice of bread a day and some brown liquid to drink, and in the evening there was supposed to be a soup but we were given no utensils. So, Alice, who had been in the ghetto, who had come from Vienna, took off her wooden clogs and we each took one of them, filled them with soup, drank the soup, and handed it to the next in line, but we guarded the shoes like yo u would guard Fort Knox. We were afraid somebody woul d steal them and run."

The floors were concrete floors and they were divided into oblong squares, oblong sections, and each section had to have five human beings, but there wasn\u2122t room for five. So, at night, we would \u0152 one would sit against the barracks wall, spread the legs and the next one would move in, until all five of us could sit that way, and in order to sleep, you would lean against the neck or the chest of the person in back of you. The corner \u0152 the center of the barracks had a raised platform, and the barracks had a coupl e who had been in Auschwitz quite a while, she had hair. She was Jewish by the looks of her. I don\u2122t know where she came from originally, not from Poland. And she had a cubicle in the corner that was sort of parceled off \u0152 it was sort of hidden away with a string that was attached to the right and left of the wall. It was a dirty old blanket, and occasionally we\u2122d see an SS man come to visit. She screamed a lot. She beat us, if we weren\u2122t fast enough. I don\u2122t think she killed anybody. Her name was Maja. She might have been from Romania. I don\u2122t know. She did not come with us, though she told us after a couple of weeks that there would be an inspection, to undress, take off the rag. There would be an SS inspection team in the center of the counting area. We should put the dress over the right arm, a nd walked passed the three SS man as fast as possible, and one of them motioned with a stick or a riding whip, a leather whip, right left, right left. We later found out that one of them was Dr. Mengele, wh ich we did not know. We had never heard of him, and it had no meaning to us until it was expl ained probably several years later, or a year later."

            "answer": "Yes. No, they said that one of them was Dr. Mengele, but we did not know who he was or what he was, and we were given another rag and a pair of random shoes. I got a size eight 118 shoes; I wear a six. And we were put into cattle cars, and when they stopped two or three days later, I stood on Dr. Singer\u2122s daughter\u2122s shoulders and I looked out through the little slit in the cattle car, and I said, \ufb01You know what? We\u2122re near Hamburg.\ufb02 And then she went up and she looked and she said, \ufb01Nah, just green landscapes; nothing Hamburg here. You\u2122ve lost your mind. It\u2122s been hot too long.\ufb02 And th e cattle car opens up, and we were housed in a warehouse of the outer harbor that housed C zech women on the other side. It housed some men from various occupied countries, and they were all used for forced labor in the Deutschebef Blomenforce (ph), the defense industry shipyards, cleaning up the bomb damage in and around Hamburg. And even Dessauer Uf er was not a concept because it was the address of a harbor area which to me had no me aning. It was not residential. But when they started us by truck or mainly in the subways in a corner, taking us to the worksites, and we had on these rags and across the rag was a yellow painted-on stripe, and underneath the fabric was cut out so you couldn\u2122t run away \u0152 no stars, no nothing. Some had a purple triangle, but very few. That I realized that indeed it was the surrounding of Hamburg, and for a minute I thought, \ufb01Since I know the area, I c ould get away.\ufb02 But how? To whom? Where? Food? And then I realized that this was ridicu lous. So, they then transferred us to another camp and in a now very fashionable area in We del where the mayor of the city lives, and there is one of these temporary houses left as a memorial, and we were guarded by 42 SS men and women. They needed people in the office to keep records of the SS personnel and of the people in the camp. There was a young lawyer from Poland, Sophie Kalishinska (ph) and I, we spoke German, who got se nt to the office. We had the disadvantage that the commander of the camp came from Southern Germany and used to be a gardener in civilian life, was vicious. He would come in and he would kick us with his boots. We had bloody legs and 119 bloody arms, but for a while we didn\u2122t go out to work in the rain, but we took a daily beating. The SS women had no compassion, no understandi ng. There was no typewriter. Everything was written manually with a pencil, not with ink. I do not know why. Most of these SS people had been drafted late in the war; they had been civil service employees before the war. For the most part, they were uneducated. The women were vicious, some of them. The men \u0152 some were vicious, some were not so bad. They brought in three women from Prague to be in charge of the camp, to be kapos. They couldn\u2122t speak Polish, but they managed German, and the story of these three women is another story. They brought in one woman who was tiny, it\u2122s also another story. We couldn\u2122t te ll how old she was. She probably was in her late \u212230s, but she ran around like a frightened mouse, and rumor had it that she was an MD by training. She came from Romania, and sh e was in charge of the hospital room, but nobody dared ever use it. It was used once for an abortion for a girl who became pregnant on the worksite, and Dr. Gisa and I met in the la trines where we would talk a few minutes, and then she would go her way and I would go my way. She had worked for Mengele in Auschwitz, and she did the abortions at night so the women c ould live and the babies died."

The camp was not the worst possible place. One of the SS women took the young woman who cleaned the SS barracks and me in a truck to Hambur g to pick-up provisions. We saw the bombed city, and she stopped at a building in front of the building that used to be upper-middle class 120 neighborhood apartments \u0152 wrought iron balconies a nd a lot of stucco work, very pretty. And she told us curtly to get out of the truck, move d us towards the entrance, all the way back and down into the basement, and she knocked on the door and the door opened and it was her mother. And the mother apologized for not having food, and the young woman who cleaned the barracks would come from Lodz with us. Sh e was very small, very tiny, but very friendly and very obliging. She told her to lie down on the couch and she covered her up and she gave me a chair to sit on, but not a word was s poken. We had an hour of rest and nobody spoke. I mean she spoke to her mother, but we didn\u2122t speak and she didn\u2122t speak. We went back to camp. We didn\u2122t tell, and we coul dn\u2122t quite figure out what the story was. I think that was the only kind gesture on the part of a German that I can recall. When they evacuated Sasel and put the gypsies there, they took us to Bergen-Belsen. Except for the overcrowded barracks and the dead bodies, I only remember two mountai ns of shoes at the gate, just empty shoes \u0152 old and new and worn, huge mountains, and wh at crossed my mind was, \ufb01Where are the feet?\ufb02 But it didn\u2122t matter anymore.

We couldn\u2122t figure out why, a nd another few days passed and then on April 15th, the British stumbled upon the camp advancing towards the Elbe River to cut off the Russians, and they managed, but they found us, as well, and they were not prepared for what 121 they found.

We had no can openers. Most of us ate that stuff. It was half lard and half pork, and probably came from an occupied country. By morning, hundreds of people were dead, among them Dr. Singer\u2122s wife. His daughter and I ate the biscuits and smoked the cigare ttes. I continued work and I didn\u2122t know when to come to work. I was allowe d to pick out a watch from the storehouse in the camp where they had items sorted by watche s, rings, pearls, jewelry, teeth \u0152 gold teeth, and I picked out a little silver watch. The back was rusted. It had a black leather band. And I wore the watch, and I thought, \ufb01If only some body would say, \u201aYou wore my watch,\u2122\ufb02 but nobody ever did. And a few days later, my boss asked, \ufb01What can I do for you?\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01I would like a shower.\ufb02 And he provided several of us with a Red Cross woman, a little piece of soap and a towel. I thought I could wash away the past. I couldn\u2122t. Eventually, we were given clean clothing. It took about four weeks. The barracks had to be burned down in 122 very short notice. They buried the dead with a bulldozer. The mass graves are there, 500,000 \u0152 5,000 \u0152 I think in all, they buried 10,000 people when I was there in September. The terrain is immense, the terrain of Bergen-Belsen. I would say probably bigger than Birkenau, but nothing remains standing because of typhus. I go t one picture of one barracks and I think you have the original in DC. And as I worked for the British, my boss asked me, \ufb01What did you do during the war? And where did you work? And with whom did you work?\ufb02 And somehow I mentioned those two months in the office a nd he said, \ufb01What did you do?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Well, I worked on names and addresses and kept a roster of the SS and a roster of food supplies, and how many women went to each wo rk detail,\ufb02 because the shipyards where we worked had to pay the government for our labor. This is what is in dispute now, if you ever see it. And he said, \ufb01You worked in the office, and you wrote down their names? Do you remember any?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01All 42 of them.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01No, can\u2122t be.\ufb02 And he gave me a pad and pencil, and I wrote them down \u0152 first name, last name and address."

He checked it out, and he found out that it was correct, and they took the truck or lorrie, as they called it, and gradually we picked up one after the other, 40 of them, in and around the city, and they all said, \ufb01We never did anything bad unless you deserved it. We never beat you. We never did anything.\ufb02 Two of them we re with the Americans in Southern Germany, and they were brought up, and I rang usually the door bell, and I asked, \ufb01Is Mrs. Miller home?\ufb02 And then her father would yell, \ufb01Else Miller, somebody here for you.\ufb02 And, she would come to the door, and the British were right behind me.

I didn\u2122t hear a thing. I was once taken to the city of Saale (ph) near Bergen-Belsen, and it was some sort of a preliminary deposition. I was asked whether I would speak German or English, and I said En glish, and I had gotten a blouse and a brown skirt and I was driven in a staff car, in an English car.

They thanked me, and they remained in prison, and a few weeks la ter I received little notes under the dormitory door where we were housed threatening my life. The first one was nothing. The second one was worrisome, and the third one, I was hysterical. Three days later, the British drove me across the Dutch border into Belgium, into Br ussels together with three other young women, and from Brussels to Lille, and the captain whos e drive drove us. We we nt out for dinner in Lille and there wasn\u2122t much to eat in \u212245 in Lille, food was rationed. They had survived a war. We ate some chicken, but it tasted like leather. I forgot. He was engaged to a young woman. It turned out he was Je wish and he had been born in Berlin, and he put me on the train in Lille for Paris, and he gave me the address of the Centre de Coeur, the youth hostel, at quatre bis rue des Rosiers. The metro opened two hours after I arrived in Paris, and I saw a Polish officer in the army, and I asked him in Polish, \ufb01Which subway do I take? How do I get there?\ufb02 I had only been to Paris once as a child. I had no idea. And he told me and he accompanied me, and I was back in the dormitory youth hostel, but this time it was Paris \u0152 no food, the food was rationed. The little clothing I had I had to sell because I needed money. And I started visiting the Amer ican embassy. They saw me coming, \ufb01There she is again.\ufb02 I made a nuisance of myself. I\u2122ve never hated a place as much as I hated Paris at that point. It 124 was no improvement except it had no German s, but living was horrible. I met a young Hungarian woman there which is again, another story, who had been married in an Orthodox ceremony at age 12 to a young man, but it was a civil ceremony. It wasn\u2122t a chupah. That was to come later, but in the eyes of the law, she was the legal wife of that man who lived in Williamsburg, New York. She eventually married him in Williamsburg, but that\u2122s a totally different story. I\u2122ll mail you that story. And we lived six of us in that tiny corner on cots with an outhouse two stories down, and for a bath in Paris you had to pay 2 francs and go down the corner to the bathhouse. It was 1945, \u212246."

The father rolled cigars fo r a living, and he also was an alcoholic. The mother was Orthodox. But somehow the contrast between these two men made the business work, because Dan was level-handed.
