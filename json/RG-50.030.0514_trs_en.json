My first office in Frankfurt was in the building of the Reichsbank branch, which is like the Federal Reserve bank. In Frankfurt that building is still there, and of c ourse the great luxury that I acquired and from which I didn\u2122t want to part was a -- was a rocking chair. After -- after a couple of years of army se rvice in a tent in other places, the rocking chair was something special anyway. But that is what we did for several months, and that was also during the period when the Soviets, as you know, would not let the American forces into Berlin. Although officia lly, according to the Alta agreement, we were supposed to be in Berlin practically from the beginning, the Soviets needed a couple of months to -- to loot, rape and whatever. And -- and so I wer -- I worked out of Frankfurt until the beginning of January, by which time already the military governor of -- was -- our military governor was -- was already in Berlin. His name was General Lucius Clay. And all the other military governors were sitting there, and there was, at that time still that instrument which was supposed to be the coordinating instrument, using the Russian term kommandatura, spelled with 32 a K, and that had to be -- that was part of our of-official vocabulary, and -- and I was then directed to move from Frankfur t to Berlin, and I moved there in January of 1946. Berlin was in a shambles, of course. It was a very cold winter. The U.S. army did some lovely things for the civilian population. Had tents on crossings and little islands with army potbelly stoves that were going all the time so people could go in and warm their hands, which I thought was -- was proper humane thing to do and -- and -- and we did it. In any event, I was then assigned to the Intelligence division of the finance department, a nd my first assignment involved the writing of a report on the largest of the German banks, wh ich was called the Deutsche bank. The Germans had three major banks. They were called the gross bank and the giant banks, that was the official German terminology. And that was the Deutsc he bank, the Dresdner bank and the Commerce bank. Deutsche is deutsche in German and Dr esdner is based on the city of Dresden, and Commerce is commerce. And they we re in -- in that order in the size, and of course once we -- we got into their -- their reco rds and -- and we interrogated a lot of people, and the picture was very clear, they -- they -- the first step was th e -- the [indecipherable] of the banking system, ri -- right after January 30, 1933 when Hitler came to power, started the removal of -- of Jews from leading positions in the banking system, both in the -- in the board of directors, which was called the [indecipherable] and the board of management , which is called the Vorstand. In this way, by the way, is -- is with a V, written as a V and pronounced as a V. Vorstand, V-o-r-s-t-a-n-d. They removed the Jews, there were -- there were prom inent Jews as bankers, and prominent Jews on -- on the boards of directors and so on. That was the first step of elimination. Then the banks proceeded to Aryanize, to take over control of -- of many of the private banks which were Jewish owned. Germany had a -- a -- a whole series, star ting with the Rothschild banks of course, but over the years private banks quite well known, Mendelssohn and -- and Aufweiser and etcetera, 33 etcetera, and Oppenheimer and so on. [indecipherable] up and down, and with the Aryanization of those banks and became instruments of the Ar yanization of Jewish businesses. And that they did very effectively and very e-e-efficiently between then -- \u2122 33 and -- and -- and \u212238 - \u212239. And then as -- as the war broke out, and particular it started first with the anschluss of Austria in March of 1938, the Deutsche bank moved in and took over the largest Austrian bank. The Dresdner bank moved in and took over the second largest Austrian bank, called the Lander bank, the first one was the [indecipherable], I mean, I -- I won\u2122t b-bore you with all this, but yeah, this is now what, \u212246, we did all this.

And there were municipal governments, and there eventually were state governments, you know, Ba varia and Hassen and whatever. But there was no central government until four -- for over four years.

Now you can say that -- that -- that the [indecipherable] and that 45 Hitler and -- and -- and the Third Reich and the industrialized, massive, incredible industrialized persecution and -- and -- and annihilation of -- of six million people in -- in five years was so earth-shaking and [indecipherable] earth-shaking. Sometimes I ask myself -- I don\u2122t know, is it -- was it for the days of the [indecipherable] pogroms for -- for the Jews at that time as great a horror as -- as -- as Kristallnacht? I-I don\u2122t know, I can\u2122t -- I can\u2122t judge it. Or -- or -- or the [indecipherable] of a whole people out of the Iberian peninsula? I mean, that certainly was not a -- a local -- a small local event of -- of some pe ople in the village of [i ndecipherable] getting cr-crazy. Now, the other possibility is -- is, of course, maybe by the 1930\u2122s, there were things around us at the world at large that -- that established some kind of preced ence, in other words of -- of some forms of coll ective response to something. I -- I\u2122 m not sure. The one thing that comes to mind for instance was the -- was the Armenian -- the persecution of the Armenians by the Turks in 1915, the World War I. I haven\u2122t rese arched that for myself well enough to know whether there was, first of all on the part of the Armenians outside of Turkey, some organized effort to attempt to confront the Turkish governme nt with it. I\u2122m not sure , at least I\u2122m not aware that it was of such open and -- and strong [indecipherable] fashion as I think happened finally in -- in the early 1940\u2122s with respect to -- to -- to the human and ma terial consequences o-of the Holocaust. And that -- and that -- I mean, I share a result of -- of a layman\u2122s perception of a feeling that something extra hist orically, certainly, in my opinion, in Jewish history, historically something extraordinary happened, and then so on. And even -- and e -- and it, to me it would be that even be necessarily confin ed to Jewish history alone. The question of a -- of a persecuted group which is not represented by a state, that does not have an army, that does not have the -- the -- the basic indices of -- of -- of power, has somehow developed firs t -- first -- first agreed or begin to -- to -- to find this -- this whole appr oach, and then -- and then ended up building, if you 46 will, the infrastructure to -- to -- to -- to -- to carry it forward and to -- and to turn it into something tangible, for the benefit of the victims, for [indecipherable] th-the victims themselves. And -- and -- and that -- that has to be analyzed. One has to analyze the elements of American Jewish history i-in -- in the -- in the 19 -- in the 1930\u2122s, in Palestine, in -- in -- in -- in how -- in how the German Jewish community reacted. In what it ca -- what it carried with it when -- when it began en masse to -- to leave. What is connected with it, of course, I mean I -- I\u2122m drifting, but I\u2122ll get back on the main track, is also where we re the fi -- where were the -- the failings? The failings being did the organized Jewish world after 1933 sufficiently analyze where the Third Reich and -- and the Nazis and Hitler were leading? After all, of the 600,000 German Jews, 300,000 remain in Germany. Now, again, I make a statement like that and it sounds again like an exaggeration an-and unqualified. I realize that among the 300,000 that stayed may have been tens of thousands who would have been -- who wanted to get out and the world wouldn\u2122t take them in, including this country. But nonetheless, there were large numbers of people, some of whom I\u2122ve known among -- among German Jewry and subsequently Austrian Jewry and so on, who thought, you know, this is a passing business, and now we\u2122re -- and now we\u2122re -- good Germans will -- will take care of this upstart over there because in other words, where th -- I f -- I forget about the world, but where -- where did the Jewish leadership? And I am not trying to be ac-accusatory, I\u2122m trying to -- to save what -- what did we f -- when I say we, I\u2122m talking in the broad, historical [indecipherable] sense, failed to see as to where it was going. Now you can make the argument I ca -- I talk to myself , you know, I -- yo-you -- you can make the argument on the other side to say there was no precedent for this type of -- of -- of organized massacres, although there were massacres in history. What follows from it ? Had we -- had we really, collectively, deeply analyzed where this was going? Maybe we could have done more than we -- 47 than we did to get people out. To protect, to save, to -- to -- to d -- I don\u2122t know to do what. So to -- to me, as I -- you know, being -- being immersed into this -- I don\u2122t know, up to the -- the tip of my head or whatever it is, or beyond it. I -- I say to myself, this -- this has to be more profoundly examined. I don\u2122t know how else to [i ndecipherable] sometimes I am at a loss for words. But -- and -- and I think this is -- this is subjects for philosophers, this is subjects for ethicists, this is subjects for historians. The Jews -- the Jews would not be -- were not alone in this world. As a matter of fact the Jews were -- were more intertwined with the world than maybe any other people because they were -- becau se they were scattered and because they had to survive always as minorities.

Menachem Begin led the opposition to the Ben Gurion government on all kinds of issues, and this became one of the major issues in his bat tle with Ben Gurion. The argument was when we should take th -- we should not take any blood money, and -- and the -- it -- it took the form of demonstrations, it took the form of -- of such se rious demonstrations that I think for the first time in the history of the state of Israel, the Kenesit had to be surrounded by police, maybe by army too, but when Ben Gurion went in January of 1952 to the Kenesit to rec -- to receive a majority vote for Israel entering into negotiations with Germany. So that controversy was partially philosophical, or partially moral if you will. I m ean, there were people who -- who really, out of 67 genuine inner convictions, and there were people who -- who mixed the opposition with -- with direct political -- this was a -- a -- a very strong issue, you have to think about it. Th -- by that time there were several hundred thousand survivors already in -- in Israel, and it was a -- a v -- a very controversial issue, and it -- it took the form of -- as I say of -- of -- of very major demonstrations in Israel. In the United States, in New York, we had one really serious episode. And that is, we had one day a meeting, after the or iginal meeting in the Wa ldorf, in another hotel in New York, and a group of a young -- there was a youth o-organization of the -- of Begin\u2122s party, and -- and they -- that organization was called Betar. This is -- today it would be the youth movement of the Likud in Israel , the -- the -- the -- the logical political extension of that movement. And they came into the hotel where we had the meeting, and they had a -- a sit down strike. They sat down in the ha llway blocking the access -- exit and the entrance to my meetings, and we had to get -- after, when the meetings were over, we wanted to get Nahum Goldmann and other of the people out because you never know if you get, particularly that this was -- Betar is a -- was a pretty militant group anyway, but in Ne w York -- in New York they were -- I mean, outside of Israel there were f -- people ideologically, philosophically, there are people today who say they\u2122re not going to go to Germany to visit, or I will not buy a German product and so on. I mean, even today, to this day, but certainly in -- in -- in those days. And it was -- it went so far, for instance, that there was one group of -- of Holocaust survivors who organized themselves generally, and those were the people who came out of Bergen-Belsen, of the Bergen-Belsen camp. And although the -- the ch airman of their group, a man called Joseph Rosensaft was actually helpful in connection with the negotiations, his organization and these people would -- would -- they would not want -- they did not want to become members of the Claims Conference because they couldn\u2122t bring themselves to negoti ate with the Germans, regardless of who the 68 Germans were who were negotiating partners. Anyway, by January of \u212252, Ben Gurion got his approval of the majority of the Kenesit, the Claims Conference was ready to go, and we had internal discussions between the Claims Conf erence and Mr. Sharett in preparation for the negotiations. But that -- we were -- one thing at that time was clear, none of us would go to Germany for negotiations. So this -- the -- the gov ernment of Israel had to find a neutral country that was willing to host us. And that was not so simple because it required security. We never knew whether neo-Nazi elements or any other elements were going to -- to cause problems. The Dutch government agreed and made available to us, a chateau. A medieval castle with a moat and a drawbridge, literally. You can still see it, it\u2122s now a co nference center. And the German delegation, headed by 20 Nazis and the Claims Conference delegation and the Israel delegation were all housed in the same chateau, in differe nt wings and so on, in the same place. And the negotiations were, as a rule, in the morning between the Germans and the Israelis, and in the afternoon between the Germans and the Claims Conf erence, and in the evenings and in between, of course, the Claims Conferen ce, and the Israeli delegates were together, obviously together [indecipherable]. And there were, of course, crises, and periods when we had to interrupt the negotiations and go over there to f -- had to fly from Paris to -- to Bonn to negotiate with Adenauer on the contentious issues and to find some kind of compromise. This happened several times. I personally had to shuttle more frequently, because as the executive director of the Claims Conference, our negotiati ons policy committee was sitting in New York, of the top lay leadership of the Claims Conference, and I would -- and first of all the Claims Conference as an organization had to function. So I would sh -- spend a couple of weeks in -- in negotiations and fly back to New York and -- and we -- the organization go back and forth. But we also had periods when the negotiations were suspended because there were serious differences of opinion. 69 The negotiations lasted from the 22 nd of March -- as a matter of fact, a day after tomorrow will be -- 207 -- 52 -- 55 years."

And -- and there were overlaps. The German delegation, by the way, was headed initially by two anti-Nazis, one a Professor Burn, a professor of civil law from Frankfurt University, who I believe was -- was towards the end of the war in a Gestapo jail. And a man called Dr. Otto Kirsten, who was a leading Protestant pol-politician o-opposing the H itler regime. He was a lawyer in Stuttgart, and -- and there was a t -- an issue a-and they were our negotiating partners. Of course, they would receive instructions from the Adenauer governme nt, and at times there were issues where -- where we knew that -- that they were communica ting to us positions that they personally were not necessarily in favor of. And this was the time that we instinctually would call time out and get ahold of -- of Nahum Goldmann in Paris and tell him to -- and ask him to fly to -- to Bonn to negotiate with Adenauer.

But as I say, whatever has been accomplished i-initially and since and now and I\u2122m sure going forward, is a produc t and the result of a collective effort of a group of individuals who are involved in a professional lay capacity that depends upon which individual and what phase and at what stage o-of -- of the various processes. When I -- when we spoke earlier about the a-antecedents of all of these programs in the immediate postwar period, and th-the -- the main issues had to be negotiate d with the U.S. government as the most powerful of the -- of the allied victorious powers, there were essentially four Jewish organizations that worked together in that effort, and that was the American Jewish Committee, the American Joint Distribution Committee, the Jewish Agency for Palestine at that time, and the World Jewish Congress. And -- and these were essentially, as far as the -- the Jewish agency for -- the Jewish Agency for Palestine were the American repres entatives, and of course Nahum Goldmann, who lived in the United States at that time and was the chairman of the -- executive of the Jewish agency in addition to being the chairman of the -- executive of the World Jewish Congress and so on and I -- I may be off by a year or two [indecipherable] the titles, but in those two organizations they played a leading role already at th -- at the -- at the end of the war. And -- and of the two American organizations, of course, th ey were domiciled in New York, and -- and ththeir -- particularly the American Jewish comm ittee had a -- a legal council in Washington, a man wh-who was also at times with the State Department, his name was Seymour Ruben. And -- and the American je -- th-the Jewish agency on these issues was represented by their American 77 council, a man called Maurice Bookstein, who was sitting -- who was living in New York as an American Jew. And -- a -- a -- and then of the -- the World Je wish Congress, there were two brothers, Jacob and Nehemiah Robinson. They bot h came from Lithuania. Jacob was already an international lawyer of some standing in the -- in the 1930\u2122s in -- in Lithuania, and Nehemiah was a outstanding scholar and he headed up the World Jewish Congress, created an institute of Jewish affairs it was called, it\u2122s official title . It was a -- a research facility, a research organization which Nehemiah led and directed. And in many, many ways he was -- he was the co-conceptualizer of -- of a lot of -- of what we developed subsequently as our specific programs for demands, etcetera. In addition to that, and of c ourse in the -- in the -- in the Joint Distribution Committee, they had the co-council in Europe as well, a man called Jerome Jacobsen and -- and people in -- in New York in the headquarters -- oh, for God sakes. Come to me in a minute. Eli Rock. E-l-i R-o-c-k. And of course, Mo-Moses Lev itt is the -- as the chie f executive in -- in the American Jewish Committee, the head of the -- their international depa rtment was a prominent European lawyer of Polish origin called Si-Simon Siegel. And his deputy was the father of the recent -- of Alan Habershi. Would you believe ? His name was Eugene Habershi, he was a Hungarian diplomat and the son of the conservati ve chief rabbi of Hungary, okay? I be -- I met Alan Habershi -- Alan Habershi when [indeciphera ble] would bring him to the office at age 15 or whatever. So anyway, I g -- I -- I give you the -- the -- the players at that point, because although they came from different corners organizati onally and so on, and there were no previous structural arrangements for cooperative activit ies, around this issue, these people and these individuals were closer together and very, very, very effective. And of course by the -- by the time it came to 1952, or fi -- or \u212251 and -- and \u21225 2 negotiations, by that time of course, Ben Ferencz and I were involved out of the operation in Germany itself of the successor organization, 78 and we worked with all these people because the American Jewish Committee and the World Jewish Congress. And -- and the American Joint Distribution Committee, and whom did I leave out? And the Jewish agency were founding members of the JRSO."

So by the time the Claims Conference came into being, ther e was already a -- a group of -- of experts, professionals plus laypeople in these respective organizations, who were involved in the subject matter. And the delegation was expanded in The Hague because we brought in people from England. First of all it was important, remember, we had to make sure that the principle, western powers were -- were there, and it was important al so to us. So a -- a man who was a member of parliament, whose name was Alec Easterman, who was member of our delegation, at least that he -- he didn\u2122t sit all the time in The Hague, he ha d to be an -- an MP in -- in London, too, but -- and what was important, the German refugee or ganization called the Council of Jews from Germany was headquartered in London. And Rabb i Leo Baeck, after whom the Baeck Institute was named subsequently, was, so to say the -- th e spiritual and the -- and the -- a-and the sort of leader of -- of this whole movement. So we -- we brought in -- in -- into the delegation the then executive head of their organization, a man called Goldschmidt, first name will come to me in a minute. And he was also, of course [indecipherable] familiar with German law. Remember, we had to negotiate ultimately, German legal commitm ents, etcetera. And th-this was -- this was the professional team, together with Jerry Jacobse n, who was council of the JDC sitting in Paris. And then of course, the Claims Conference leader ship itself, the -- wh-which was supervising the negotiating, laying out the policies, because we couldn\u2122t have 24 organizations being in 79 permanent session, whereas Jacob Blaustein, who was -- obviously Nahum Goldmann as the president, Jacob Blaustein as the senior vice pres ident, he was the head of the American Jewish Committee. A -- by today\u2122s standards he would be one of the billionaires. In those days he was a multi-millionaire [indecipherable] Baltimore oil company.

In those days, a much more str -- a stronger organization than the Jewish Labor Committee is today, they are still an organization covering a segment of Jewish life, but you have to know, pa rticular for our negotiations, during the Nazi period, the Jewish Labor Committee in this c ountry brought some of the German social democrats, some of the German trade unionists, ev en if they were in Sweden and in exile, they would raise money and support them financially. They had a close, ongoing personal relationship with the second largest political party in Germany after the war, the Social Democratic party.

How can one put a dollar number on psychological, emotional, and on -- and also physical consequences? We always say, and I\u2122m not alone in that, that what -- what we succeeded to some extent is to provide a measure of compensa tion, some degree, combined with what I said to you before, which is not tangible, but wh-what -- but to me extremely important, and that is the basic acknowledgment on the part of either the g overnment or the entity or the agency that provides compensation, that it had responsibility, legal, moral, but responsibility. And on the other hand, among the hundreds of thousands of su rvivors, not everybody was able to make the kind of economic to build a new existence for on eself, economically, prof essional, business-wise or otherwise that -- that the compensation that they obtained for that -- for many it has genuine economic significance. For people for whom -- who as I said to you before, whether it is in the depth of Brooklyn or -- or in the -- or in the resettlement towns of Israel, or -- or in eastern Europe, or wherever it is, when the compensation coming as a result of our negotiations and so on, may equal and exceed old age assistance or Social Security, or whatever it is, and it makes a difference between marginal existence in a late st age of people\u2122s lives, and a sense of -- of some acceptable minimum with a -- with a minimum of -- of -- of dignity and of -- and of self respect in a sense that an individual can have, that is of great importance. And -- and particularly in this stage where the vast majority of the survi vors are 80 and over, remember anybody who was born 89 in, let\u2122s say who was 10 years old when World War II broke out in Poland, okay? Born in 1929. That individual today is 78, okay? This is a child survivor . There are organizations of child survivors. Kindertransport people, okay? This is the young end of the -- of this population. And particularly in the western world, with progress of -- of medi cal care and so on, people live longer. I say people exist longer, you know, to me there is a great distinction between those two words. But people are there longer, in mo -- re quiring much more care and attention for their medical needs and so on, with a greater strain and s -- on -- on their financial resources. So in a -- in a strange way, some of the compensation bene fits today for the people who ended up retiring on a -- on a very modest basis and in some parts of the world on a below modest basis, or in a non-existent basis, th-this compensation is -- is truly meaningful, and is of great importance. We negotiate periodically cost of living adjustments on the pens ions. One of -- I think one of the brilliant things that we did in the -- in The Hague, is we wrote in a clause that the pensions, that the compensation pensions will be adjusted on a co st of living basis as the pensions of civil servants of Germany, because we knew that the civil servants of Germany have a powerful organization and they will fight for cost of living adjustments. And we got the Germans to agree that the compensation -- we knew it is the compensa tion pensions will be adjusted cost of livingwise in the same percentage as those. So I say th at to illustrate that the -- the economic impact for certain categories of survivor s was and is important. And as I say in some -- in some strange way, becoming more important now for those who were to retire in a -- on a -- on a very limited basis."

Following that the United States established diplomatic relations with East Germany. We assisted and we had the support of the U.S. government, at that 91 time the assistant secretary for European affairs was Mr. Hartman, telling the East Germans that the United States will not enter into diplomatic relations unless the East Germans will agree to negotiate with the Claims Conference concerning issues of compensation, something like that. The Communist East Germans resisted it v-vi olently. They are a state and they are not negotiating with some non -- non-governmental agen cy, or something like that. Finally, th-they - they knew that they couldn\u2122t get around it, so th ey created an anti-Fascist committee to be our non-governmental partner. And from 1974 to 1989, we negotiated with the bloody German -- East Germans, and w -- and we were getting nowhere. We were periodically going there every year at the time of the general assembly of the United Nations. The foreign minister of East Germany would come here, and on Park Avenue [indecipherable] we would meet. Ben Ferencz and Israels -- and Israel Miller and Saul Kagan and whatever, a nd in 1987 I think I told you we had -- they officially invited us as their guests for negotiations with them in Germany, and they wanted that we should deliver to them most favored nations status in the United States so they -- and then maybe they would consider doing it. At one point Benny went for a meeting with the anti-Fascist committee and totally unexpectedly was handed a one million dollar check to -- to the Claims Conference that we should, with a milli on dollars, help needy Nazi victims in -- in the United States. Within 48 hours the check was se nt back to the German -- to the German Communists, and believe me, through this whole period, people in our board were telling Israel Miller and Ben Ferencz and Saul Kagan and a fe w other people, stop banging your head against this wall, nothing will happen. We never let up. We didn\u2122t accomplish anything, but we never let up. We -- there were poi -- there were moments wher e the -- where they were making offers to us which we -- of the cali -- cal -- caliber which -- which were unacceptable, but you can get really discouraged, you know? You go back on the back -- ev en with the west Germans, as I told you, 92 between 1975, when d\u00e9tente came in, again you see, you got to relate that to [indecipherable] development. D\u00e9tente, Helsinki, negotiations between -- between President Ford and the Helsinki agreements, and the great pressure with the Jackson-Vanik pressure to let Jews out of -- emigrate from the Soviet Union. Among them, I don\u2122t have to tell you, hundred -- tens of thousands of -- of vict -- of Holocaust survivors of -- of -- of the most horrible persecution. Th-The survivors of the [indecipherable] group, and I mean I -- with you I can talk it [indecipherable] than that. We came back to the Germans and said, you have to open the filing period of the compensation laws. These are not people who were lazy. It was forced [indecipherable] they were barred by your laws and by your provisions from f-filing claims. We could not get the opposition, we could not get the government to agree. We dismantled the machinery, we cannot do any more. We couldn\u2122t get Willie Brandt, who certainly was a -- Willie Brandt who went to Warsaw on his knees, you know, a -- ap -- apologizing on behalf of Germany for what has been done to -- to the - in the Warsaw ghetto to the Jews of Poland. Couldn\u2122t budge him, couldn\u2122t budge the -- the ch r -- the Christian demo crat opposition. Couldn\u2122t bud -- budge his successor who was Helmut Schmid t, another Social Democrat. Finally, after five years practically -- and believe me, people are now, and -- a nd I don\u2122t -- I -- I\u2122m not being critical of anybody -- you know, if you come to meetings a few times a year and whatever it is, and you -- and you hear the same -- the same sad s ong about we met with this one, we met with that one, we met with this parliamentarian, and th at politician. We were here and we were there, and we had the press conference, and we did this and that. And what have you got to show? And when finally, finally they came up with this hardship fund one time payment and you, Claims Conference, administer it. And Nahum Goldmann turned to me and said, \ufb01Now you gotta set up 93 an organization.\ufb02 Which as I said to you before, you -- an organization which would have to tell some people no.
