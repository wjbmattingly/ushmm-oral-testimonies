He never saw battle, because as soon as he reached the front, negotiations started, Germany came to the aid of Italy, and negotiations started for a peace treaty.

Now, he was 35 - 37 years old, he was overweight. He was not trained the first time, he had an office job. And certainly not trained the second time. So he didn\u2019t really know how to use a rifle \u2014 basic, he never had basic training. And so he was forever not \u2014 he was not able to keep up with the others \u2014 Greek soldiers. He was separated from his company several times. He had to deal with a mule that was not very cooperative. So, going to the front and returning, he was \u2014 was a struggle for him. So he was among the last soldiers to return, and so my \u2014 I \u2014I heard my mother and brother saying how they would go out to the main street every morning, every day, waiting for my father to show up. It was a very anxious time for them. So, after he returned, we \u2014 we, the whole family returned to Agrinion. This is \u2014 this is the time when German and Italian troops began pouring into the \u2014 the country. A-And Germans actually first came to \u2014 to Ioannina, but then later on, as we will discuss, later on the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the occupation zones were determined and the Germans occupied the northern part of Greece, and the Bulgarians another section.

            "answer": "Yes. So we \u2014 we didn\u2019t know where to go \u2014 coming back to the story. And at that time there were two resistance movement in Greece. One was based in the countryside in Epirus, near Ioannina, the outskirts of Ioannina. EDES was headed by Napoleon Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Ninetta Feldman \u00b0 September 14, 2010 Zervas, and they were known as the \u2014 but, at that time, the country was polarized between the \u2014 the nationalists, the right wing people, and the leftists. And so the resistance movements were also polarized. You have EDES, headed by Napoleon Zervas in Epirus, and then EAM-ELAS, much larger, very well organized resistance movement in the countryside of Greece, but also within the cities of \u2014 of Greece. And so we had neighbors, friends, who advised us to go to EDES, and other friends who advised us to go to a territory controlled by EAM-ELAS. So we had some very close family friends, the Bokoros family; there were three brothers and two sisters, actually three sisters. There was Christos and Thermas(ph) Bokoros, and we knew them, we became fam \u2014 we became family friends because their sister Elestair(ph) was married to a man who was a colleague of my father\u2019s in \u2014 in the bank. I think we met \u2014 they met them either in Preveza or Arta, I don\u2019t know. And unfortunately her husband, Elestair\u2019s husband died, and the whole family moved to Agrinion and they lived \u2014 and so she and her children lived with her brothers, Christos and Thermas(ph) and Kostas Bokoros. So, we decided to ask them for help, and they were wonderful people, they did everything they could to assure us that we\u2019ll find you a place, we\u2019ll get you out of the city. And so after we distributed our belongings to the neighbors, my mother, my brother and I, we \u2014 we sent some of the material, clothing and food and household utensils, with a porter to transport these things to the Bokoros\u2019 house, and then we, the three of us, my mother, my brother and I followed behind. My father went to work that day, he had to \u2014 they received Interview with Ninetta Feldman a September 14, 2010 a very large amount of money, and he was replacing the \u2014 the cashier, so he had to go there and to count the money. And so we reached the Bokoro \u2014 Bokoros\u2019 house, and a few minutes later \u2014 I remember this very vividly, I know this is a firsthand recollection. I remember a German bursting into the house and \u2014 and then my mother, you know, she saw this \u2014 she saw him, and she quickly pushed him in \u2014 pushed me into the adjacent room and she quickly pulled the covers off the bed, and pretended to calmly make the bed, as though she belonged there. She\u2019s a very quick thinker, sh \u2014 amazing person. So th-the \u2014 the German sort of looked around. I don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t know what \u2014 who he was looking for, and then he left. But 1t was a very frightening experience for \u2014 for \u2014 for all \u2014 for my mother and \u2014 and my brother. I don\u2019t remember where my brother was at this point. All I remember was my mother making the bed at this point. And she asked Christos, one of the Bokoros brothers to quickly go to the bank and tell my father to \u2014 to drop everything and come to the house, we had to leave immediately. So Christos goes to the bank, and told my father that \u2014 does he have \u2014 even though you haven\u2019t finished counting the money, you have to drop everything and leave. An-And certainly the people in the bank were very cooperative. They signed everything as though they had cou \u2014 as the mon \u2014 as though the money had been counted and everything, or the transaction was very orderly. And so my father comes to the Bokoros house. And then, where there\u2019s another problem they confront is the lack of transportation. The Germans had requisitioned all means of transportation; trucks, taxis, mules, horses. And so the brothers Interview with Ninetta Feldman \u201c September 14, 2010 couldn\u2019t find a way for us to leave that day, which was October second. And so we spent the night in their house, and the following day they came with a taxi. They found a taxi that was going to Kremasta. This was a spa near the river Acheloos river, nearby. Was so-some distance, few kilometers outside Agrinion. And he had \u2014 the taxi driver had other passengers to transport to the \u2014 the the Acheloos spa. And so this is we \u2014 we got in the tax1 with some blankets, and you know, some household ma \u2014 equipment, materials that we brought with us, and so we left the city. I remember that, I remember how my mother said we should crouch into the \u2014 the taxi, not to draw attention to ourselves, because people did not use taxis then to \u2014 to \u2014 to move around, we didn\u2019t want to \u2014 to draw attention to ourselves. And then as soon as we \u2014 we came to the outskirts of the city of Agrinion, we had to pass through a German checkpoint. And the driver, who apparently did this route quite often, he knew how to deal with the German guards there, and he gave them some raisins and cigarettes, and they let us pass. And then \u2014"

I \u2014 you know, my mother fussed over me a lot, I had very pretty clothes, and a huge bow on my hair; that was the style, and curls like \u2014 my mother would say like Shirley Temple. And so I \u2014 I drew their attention from my appearance alone. The worst thing for Interview with Ninetta Feldman *\u00b0 September 14, 2010 me was that the day would start with the Lord\u2019s Prayer, Pater Hemon. And this is a Christian prayer, which after I analyzed it as an adult, you know, is very acceptable prayer, could say universal prayer. However, it had to be \u2014 was followed by the sign of the cross, and I did not make the sign of the cross. I\u2014 I did not know much about Jewish religion at that point.

Now, I\u2019m not sure whether we got a goat at this point, or later on, I\u2019m not sure. But I remember that for me, getting a goat was the dream of my life. It was a goat of my own, and the \u2014 and it was really a \u2014 in order for us to have a source of milk. And th- the goat spent most of the time with the Tsulamitsu(ph) family, they were very nice, very hospitable, kind, generous people. And they spent the time there, they would milk the goat and bring the milk for us to drink. But we also, you know, I spent a lot of time with \u2014 with the goat, I \u2014 I really became very attached to her. So after we \u2014 we acquired all these food supplies, we felt very comfortable in the village. It felt like a vacation. I Interview with Ninetta Feldman * September 14, 2010 was going to school, my brother had brought his high school books, and my father said, you should start studying. And my father had brought a book of English method \u2014 how \u2014 a method to learn English without a teacher. I remember that book. My brother has it \u2014 still has it. And \u2014 and of course my mother didn\u2019t need any \u2014 any additional work. She really had to work very hard because there was \u2014 she had to do the laundry and the cooking and all the washing of the dishes, without \u2014 without a stove, without running water. It was a real hardship for her. And so we didn\u2019t felt comfortable at that point, and my father started writing letters to our rel-relatives in Ioannina, urging them to leave the city and \u2014 and go to the mountains. And we used friends t-to \u2014 to transport these letters from \u2014 from the village of Psilovrahos to a colleague of my father\u2019s, Evyanea(ph) Papadapoulou(ph) I believe was her name. And she would in turn send the letters to her sister or brother in Ioannina, and they would deliver them to our relatives. And everything was written in code, and we never used the word Psilovrahos, it was our \u2014 it was a code word like, our place in the mountains, or our vacation place. And so we were urging them to leave, and the reply was that everything is fine here. We have plenty of food, and they were actually worried about the children catching cold up in the mountains, because at that time, the ger \u2014 there \u2014 there was no indication of anything was going to happen to them now. Ioannina, or Ioannina at this point is occupied by the Germans, but there was no indication that anything bad was going to happen. So \u2014 so we felt very secure in the village, and we actually began to enjoy our life there, vacation Interview with Ninetta Feldman \u201c September 14, 2010 spot, until suddenly it was \u2014 I believe it was November, the end of November, when Yonas Mionis, this is the same man \u2014"

By that time there were two more Jewish men who had ended up in Psilovrahos, they had come from another city, I believe Helkese(ph). And of course you know we were \u2014 my parents, they panicked. They \u2014 they were advised to go to a higher place up in the mountains. And we arranged with a mule driver to come the following morning, to transport us to this higher place. And I remember th-the \u2014 oh well, during the night \u2014 during the night, was a very frightful night, because we didn\u2019t know whether the Germans were advancing during the night, but there was a big explosion, a distant explosion. We didn\u2019t know where it was coming from. I should say that when Yonas Mionis came to alert us of the advance of the Germans, there was there \u2014 the church bells started to ring alarm, and these young men of EPON was calling everybody to his feet, and urging able-bodied men to take their weapons, rifles, whatever they had, and go to Agios Vlassis to stop advance of the Germans. So, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Ninetta Feldman \u201c September 14, 2010 the following morning, this mule driver arrives and \u2014 and now again, I don\u2019t know whether I heard my mother say that, or I heard her say that much later, but 1t impressed me that these \u2014 what kind of mules are these? These are just a \u2014 they look like big \u2014 big dogs; they were very small. And of course, we were very grateful that there was a means of transportation, so we loaded a few \u2014 a few things and along with the other Jewish men, we started climbing the mountain. Now, this part I know is firsthand experience. I remember my mother saying \u2014 I was getting tired, and my mother kept saying, keep walking, keep walking, you have to \u2014 because I was behind everybody. And I don\u2019t know whether she said the Germans are coming, but all she was urging me to walk faster. And so it \u2014 it was a \u2014 it was a rainy day, and I remember my mother insisted that we all wear extra clothing for warmth, and finally we reached a house, this mule driver took us to the house of a man called Chiandafelis(ph). It was a \u2014 th-there were no other houses there, just his house. And of course, he opens the door, sees this unlikely group of people, city people at his doorstep, he didn\u2019t know what was going on. And \u2014 and it was revealed that \u2014 that wi \u2014 th-the \u2014 the mule driver told him who we were and why we were there. So they probably \u2014 he probably told them that we are Jewish, and that the Germans were advancing. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know exactly what he told him. But when the man, Mr. Chiandafelis(ph) heard the word Agrinion, he became very excited, because he told us that his daughter Theandafela(ph) was working for a family in Agrinion, the family of Davaroukas(ph). And it so happened that Davaroukas(ph) was a colleague of my Interview with Ninetta Feldman \u00b0 September 14, 2010 father\u2019s in the National Bank of Greece. So he became very excited, because my father told him, oh I know your daughter, she came to the bank several times, and I know her, she is a very nice girl. And you see, a lot of villagers would send their daughters into the city to work as maids in hope that they would learn to grow \u2014 to learn \u2014 acquire some skills with city people. They would take them out of school and they would work as maids to bring some income for the family, and also learn to be nice young ladies, the way city people were. So he welcomed us, you know, from strangers we became friends. He welcomed us and \u2014 and offered us a place to \u2014 to sleep. The Greeks are very hospitable people."

But then there was this incident of my brother seeing this group of men and horses or mules ascending this precipice and she panicked and said, oh the Germans are coming, and created a lot of panic among all of us, because in addition to my family, there were now three additional Jewish men; one of them was Yonas Mionis, the resistance leader. And we all dispersed behind rocks, behind trees and that 1s when \u2014 oh, and then Mr. Chiandafelis(ph) sent his son, Spyros down the mountain to see who these people were and he discovered just villagers returning to their homes. But then they recognized that we were terrified of the possibility of being discovered by the Germans, and so they rec \u2014 Chiandafelis(ph) recommended that we spend the day in this cave, called Arapo(ph). Kefalas(ph), and \u2014 and the night at his house. And that\u2019s exactly what we did, this Spyros, Mr. Chiandafelis\u2019 son guided us to the \u2014 to the cave, and that again, I have a firsthand recollection. I remember this very vividly as a child going into a cave. It was quite an experience, and I was \u2014 I was frightened. I was frightened at first, because it was so dark, especially, you know, before our eyes adjusted to the darkness, it was very dark, and there was all kinds of formations of stalactites and stalagmites. And my father Interview with Ninetta Feldman *\u00b0 September 14, 2010 found a little ledge on the side, sort of halfway into the cave. It was like an alcove, and we spread the blankets, and the four of us huddled together in this dark cave. And \u2014 and my father, he \u2014 he always tried to calm everybody down, and \u2014 and he \u2014 this a \u2014 he\u2019s a \u2014 was a very good storyteller. So he would tell us different kinds of stories about his exploits, ab \u2014 as a soldier going up to the \u2014 to the front, the Albanian \u2014 Greek Albanian front or \u2014 and then Bible stories, lots of Bible stories, which he embellished greatly to entertain us. And I don\u2019t know whether this is \u2014 actually happened. I don\u2019t know he \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 whether he explained to m \u2014 to us how these structures are formed in the cave. I-I don\u2019t remember whether he explained, but I have a feeling that he did, but I\u2019m not positive. And so, it was hours that we had to s \u2014 to spend in this alcove, in the dark \u2014 semi-darkness. We could hear the dripping of the water in the back, as the water mixed with minerals, would drip down into a \u2014 a pond at the bottom of the \u2014 of the cave. And then suddenly we hear somebody call my father, you know, Mr. Matsas, Mr. Matsas. And we were frightened because we thought somebody discovered us. And so we decided not to \u2014 to say anything, to keep quiet. But the voice persisted, Mr. Matsas, Mr. Matsas, then he said I\u2019m \u2014 this is Spyros. Come out, come out, it\u2019s safe, 1t\u2019s calm, this 1s Spyros, Chiandafelis\u2019(ph) son. And \u2014 and I don\u2019t remember whether we came out, or the people outside came in, I don\u2019t remember. But later on my father said that he was afraid at first that they were going to throw a grenade, because at first we thought there were Germans, enemies. But what we discovered when we \u2014 we met the two people that Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 Spyros had brought there, these were two other Jewish men who were seeking shelter, like we were. They were in Agios Vlassis and when the Germans advanced, at that point they left and they came to Psilovrahos, and then they were told that this Jewish family up \u2014there\u2019s another family up in \u2014 hiding up higher in the mountains. So now Mr. Chiandafelis(ph) had several people to feed every night. But we decided that the villa \u2014 the \u2014 the cave was not safe either, so my father searched in the forest for a secluded place. And so we decided to spend the day in this secluded place, and the nights at the house."

And my father tried to calm her down, that we will send a man down in the village, in the \u2014 in Agrinion to get some food from the bank. And this is something we did, but the man came back with one small ca \u2014 one can of oil, that was all he could bring, because he was bringing food supplies for his family, and that was the only additional weight for the mule to carry. But I was friends with the \u2014 the children of the owner of the house, and they told me one day, oh \u2014 they were boasting, oh, we have so much food now. We have rice and beans, we have \u2014 we even have candles. We have things that we never had before. And I \u2014 I was very impressed, and I reported this to my parents, you know, I said the \u2014 my friends, they told me they have all this good stuff. And immediately my parents suspected that the owner of the house was the one who looted the room, and my father confronted him, and he denied that he \u2014 he took anything. And my father persisted, and he had to accept to \u2014 the fact that \u2014 he had to admit that he did take a few things. He was afraid of my father talking about this to the village, and that he was going to be embarrassed. And so he returned a few items. But my parents knew that he probably had a lot more, and was hidden somewhere. And so my father searched the \u2014 the barn and other hidden \u2014 possible Interview with Ninetta Feldman \u201c September 14, 2010 places where he could have hidden food, and sure enough they \u2014 he found a can of oil. And oil was a real treasure, because was \u2014 this is olive oil, was very hard to find, very valuable, if you were going to use it as a commodity to exchange it for other kinds of food. So my parents were infuriated with this man because he \u2014 he really \u2014 he created the situation that we \u2014 we were trying to avoid, and that is lack of food in the winter. So they considered bringing this matter to the people\u2019s court. There were people\u2019s courts then, in villages. They were not official courts, but they were \u2014 consisted of the elders of the village, and all sorts of ma \u2014 matters of \u2014 disputes were brought to the people\u2019s court. And the people\u2019s court was actually very severe in punishments that \u2014 that they imposed on people. So my parents reconsidered that, because they were afraid he would be, who knows, imprisoned, or some very severe punishment; he had a young family, so they decided to drop the matter. And that they also didn\u2019t want to draw attention to ourselves. So they dropped the matter, and at this point we had to leave that room, and we went to another house to live in. This was very similar to the one we occupied the first time. This one had two rooms, one room was a Kafeneio, a caf\u00e9. And the other room was the room that we occupied, and th \u2014 and it had a basement. And so \u2014 so that was a big change, it was \u2014 we adjusted to it very quickly. But the main concern now was food. There was a family by the name Yovanos(ph) who lived in Agrinion, but had come to the village for the summer, and they stayed on because of the \u2014 the war situation. But they had decided to return to Agrinion. And they had a lot of wheat with them. So my father, being a bank Interview with Ninetta Feldman \u201c September 14, 2010 employee, he conducted a transaction not with checks, but with wheat. He told him, if you give us your wheat that is here, you can collect our wheat, which is stored in the bank. It was an exchange, and no wheat had to travel to Agrinion or from Agrinion to Psilovrahos, but it was a transaction that s-seemed reasonable to him, and he gave us a certain amount of wheat. But he had more wheat, but this other villager that was wealthy, who could have cooperated at this point and \u2014 and he could have made the Yovanos(ph) wheat available to us, he decided not to do that, and he kept the wheat for \u2014 for himself. And that was a very callous thing to do, and he, years later when \u2014 after the war, the man recognized that he had done something very, very bad, and he came to my father and my parents and \u2014 and asked them for their forgiveness, because by \u2014 by not agreeing to make this wheat available to us, he made life absolutely horrible for the family. So \u2014 so th-that is the situation now, we are \u2014 we have very little food. We do have this oil that the villager brings from the village, and this wheat. Then my mother started exchanging sugar for a certain kind of cereal that is called Trachanas. It\u2019s a \u2014a coarsely ground wheat mixed with milk that is \u2014 that \u2014 that 1s in a dry state and when you add some milk, it expands, and it\u2019s a very nutritious food and very filling. So \u2014 so this is what my mother started doing, exchanging sugar for \u2014 for Trachanas or corn meal. Then some of the villagers would give us some eggs from the chickens, some milk, a piece of cheese. It was a very difficult situation and there\u2019s winter approaching, it\u2019s already winter. It 1s cold. And so then, my mother, wh-who is a very resourceful person, she decided that \u2014 Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Ninetta Feldman \u00b0\u00b0 September 14, 2010 that she is going to barter clothing, our personal clothes, for food. And so she became a peddler, and she went with my 13 year old brother from village to village, exchanging clothing for food. Or, she did other things. She knitted for people. She was \u2014 she had many skills. She knew how to make lace. An-And one \u2014 one thought came to her mind is that the girls in the village, they want to prepare their dowry, and I can teach them how to \u2014 to knit. I di\u2014 can teach them how to embroider, how to make lace, and so \u2014 and said, there are a lot of girls in the village who would want this, and they would exchange my services for food. And the one family that I mentioned earlier, the Tsulamitsu(ph) family, they had seven daughters. They had prepare seven dowries. So she went to \u2014 started with them. And she\u2019d go there every day and help them, show them how to embroider, how to make lace and so on, in exchange for cheese or bread or whatever they had. So they ha \u2014 my parents had to start rationing the food. It was less and less every day. And I \u2014 I remember it was winter, still winter, and there were some mulberry trees and fig trees. There are a lot of mulberry trees and fig trees in Greece. And my mother said, you know, when these, you know, these fig trees, when spring and summer come, th-they\u2019ll be full of figs. And so I remember this game very vividly, you know, walking underneath those trees, waiting for someday to see figs up on the tree."

            "answer": "The money was worthless, yes, yes. One wonderful thing happened during this period of \u2014 of, literally, starvation. A group of partisans, or andartes, as they were known, they came to the village and they camped there, they \u2014 they settled there for 20 days. There were 60 of them. I don\u2019t know why they settled in the village, but my parents recognized there was an opportunity for us to get food. And it was either my father or brother who approached the captain of this band, and described our desperate situation and asked them if they could help us. And the captain agreed to give us the equivalent of two portions of a \u2014 of food for one partisan, for the four of us to share. And so my brother, when the \u2014 the bugle was sounded, he could go there with a pot, and they would give him the portion of \u2014 of a partisan, which was not very much. It was just corn soup and a piece of corn bread. But for us it was God sent. And he did that twice a day, and we would share the food, and \u2014 and that was for 20 days. That was quite a \u2014 a long time. So that was the situation. I don\u2019t know at what point my parents \u2014 my mother decided that she should use \u2014 not \u2014 to sell not only our personal clothing, but also household items. I don\u2019t know whether it was in that \u2014 in the wintertime or later on in the spring, but just all of a sudden she got this bright idea of \u2014 of using the cases \u2014 we had brought mattress cases. In Greece \u2014 in Greece you protect everything you have, like mattress, you have to have a case for the mattress, to protect it from dust. And so we \u2014 when we came to the village, we brought these mattress cases with us, and we stuffed them with hay to make mattresses. So my mother, out of desperation she had this brilliant idea, said, I have these mattress cases. I Interview with Ninetta Feldman \u00b0\u00b0 September 14, 2010 can \u2014 I can use them to make pants for \u2014 for boys, or men. These \u2014 the villagers are dressed in rags. And \u2014 but these mattress cases, usually, they have very bright stripes, red stripes. So my father said, nobody is going to wear these ridiculous looking pants, with these bright stripes. And then he thought further and said well, we \u2014 we can dye them, we can dye them brown. And that was my father\u2019s great opportunity to experiment and he \u2014 he said, we\u2019ll gather shells of \u2014 walnut shells, and they were plentiful in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the fields, and \u2014 and poppies. So this must have happened 1n the spring, early spring, and there are lots of poppies in \u2014 growing in \u2014 in the mountains. So he made this concoction, boiled walnut shells with the poppies, creating this brown gooey material, and dipped these mattress cases when they came, and boiled them for a few minutes, and then they turned brown. Later on I found out that \u2014 that in colonial times they used walnuts to dye wool and \u2014 and fabric. So \u2014 so my mother made pants for \u2014 for boys, and then she used sheets, the sheets that we brought, to make shirts for men. And so she had all these wares to exchange for food, then she went from village to village with my brother, doing that. And she\u2019d come home with \u2014 with cheese or bread or \u2014 everything was delicious to us, anything was delicious."

So there were times he had to cross a creek, or a \u2014 a river [indecipherable] that was not \u2014 not a very deep river, but he \u2014 he came down with aches on his legs, and then he had the dizzy spells. He had a few medical problems that had \u2014 had the \u2014 they were left unattended, although there were a couple of occasions when my mother and brother, they walked a long distance to a village called Tatarna that had a hospital for the partisans, and there was a doctor there. They consulted with him, and the doctor gave them some medicine Interview with Ninetta Feldman \u201d September 14, 2010 for my father, but somehow the villagers and us had managed to recover whatever ailments we had, on our own. So that was the situation in the winter. It was a very desperate situation. Then when spring came, there were \u2014 things were a little better because they gave us a short \u2014 a small plot to cultivate. And then there were mulberries. The mulberry trees plentiful, which caused \u2014 and we lived on mulberry berries for a number of days until we developed stomach cramps and we realized we had to stop that. But it was a very difficult period, and my mother, she bore the brunt of it, she really did. That is the reason why, throughout this period she kept saying that I will go myself down to the city and bring a horse-load of food. And \u2014 and there were groups of villagers that were going to the city. And she said, Ill just join one of them and go down into the city. And my father and brother always say no, no, absolutely not. And she would say why? The villagers go. And \u2014 and she \u2014 they would say, yeah, but you\u2019re not an ordinary villager, you \u2014 you\u2019re Jewish. And she said, well, I have an I.D. card, because they \u2014 my parents had acquired I.D. cards issued by \u2014 by the Germans. The priests of the village provided them with baptismal papers and so the papers were given to the German authorities. The names had \u2014 were changed. And there was a picture and my \u2014 both my parents had an I.D. card with their picture and signed by German officials. But the \u2014 the ironic thing 1s that in the I.D., they do not ask for religion. It\u2019s rather bizarre. Perhaps they didn\u2019t want to raise suspicions that \u2014 because tha-that was one of the reasons why many Jews in the cities, such as Ioannina did not feel threatened, did not feel that they Interview with Ninetta Feldman m September 14, 2010 should leave, they should go into hiding, because the Germans were careful not to raise suspicions of what was awaiting them. And \u2014 and in fact, the letters that we were receiving from my relatives in Ioannina were \u2014 were, you know, why don\u2019t you come to Ioannina, we have plenty of food. Why should you be starving up there? And the same letter from Evianir(ph) Papadapoulos(ph), our \u2014 my father\u2019s colleague, you know, come to Agrinion, there is plenty of food. And there were many cases of Jews who returned. They had left the city and gone to the countryside to hide. And because nothing was happening in the cities, they returned, and they were eventually arrested. But my \u2014 my father, my brother were \u2014 an-and my mother were determined to stay in the village. So \u2014 but she, every time she saw a group of villagers going down to Agrinion, she would say, all I have to do is just join them and \u2014 and our situation will improve."

The Jews of Arta and Preveza are now housed in the Papapetrou tobacco warehouses and I don\u2019t know where they took the Jews of Ioannina.

            "answer": "That was a very affluent village, and it had this hospital for the partisans and then the villagers. One of the \u2014 the doctors there at one point was Thanos(ph) Papatheodoro(ph), a very fine man, whose family also lived in the vicinity. And a \u2014 it\u2019s just a si \u2014 it was a \u2014 quite a coincidence, my mother and brother met them, met the family and the doctor and there were three daughters, Hera, Ephemia(ph) and Irini(ph), or Nini(ph). And the middle one, Ephemia(ph) became my best friend after the war. We\u2019re friends to this day. And there were \u2014 they were \u2014 played a very important role in the family, in my development. They were a very cultured family, and it was through them that I was exposed to classical music and paintings. Her father was an amateur painter. A very refined person. And \u2014 and this 1s the hospital where my f\u2014 my brother was asked by the doctor \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether it was Dr. Papatheodoro(ph) or Dr. Panopoulous(ph), the earlier doctor, asked my father to sing the ma \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, my brother Mykas(ph), he was known as Mykas(ph) partisan songs. And my \u2014 my f \u2014 brother loved those partisan songs, they were in the air, everywhere. They were very idealistic, describing a wonderful society that is going to be built after the war, a society that was free of ignorance and poverty and injustice. And all of these wonderful ideas appealed to him as Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Ninetta Feldman m September 14, 2010 a young person. And so he \u2014 he learned all those wonderful songs. He sings them to this day. I\u2014I learned a few of them, but he was the one who \u2014 who sang them, and he had a beautiful voice, he still does. So now I will come back to the \u2014 to this encounter of my mother with Mrs. Volis(ph). So Mrs. Volis(ph) tells her that you have to leave as soon as possible. She talked to her husband, Mr. Volis(ph), and he suggested that \u2014 n-now my mother actually, even at this point, she said \u2014 she insisted that she go into the city, in spite of all this. She said, we\u2019re starving, we \u2014 we have to get some food. And so her husband recommended that she go to another village called Kamaroula, where he has a kombarro(ph). Kombarro(ph) is a godfather. And his name was Christos Zambarros(ph), and he \u2014 he was a teacher, and he said, he will help you. So my mother started walking alone with this horrible knowledge of \u2014 of what had happened to our people, to Kamaroula. She recognizes the house where this man lived, knocks on the door several time, they do not answer. Eventually they open the door very cautiously, they let her in very quickly, and she \u2014 she told them who she was and who \u2014 who sent her to them, and she said, I\u2019m looking for Christos Zambarros(ph). These were the sisters of Christos, and they said \u2014 they were \u2014 they were frightened because the Germans has searched their house moments before my mother arrived. They took her to the window and they said \u2014 pointed to the \u2014 to the square and said, look down there. You see, the Germans are still there and they\u2019re still searching for people there. They were searching for partisans, because at this point the \u2014 the resistance had grown very strong and they Interview with Ninetta Feldman . September 14, 2010 were sabotaging the German advance and German actions; blowing bridges and destroying roads. And so they said, take this ker \u2014 they gave her a kerchief quickly, said put it on, and just pretend that you are our aunt from Psilovrahos. Don\u2019t say anything. They sent for their brother and he came, and my mother explained to him what was ha \u2014 what happened, and begged him to \u2014 to go \u2014 I think \u2014 I think what happened \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 I\u2019m not so sure at this point whether she had to go to their country home where a deaf mute aunt was guarding their store \u2014 the food supplies. I don\u2019t know where this meeting with Christos Zambarros(ph) took place, but he was very, very nice, and understood the situation, and he said, don\u2019t worry. I will go down to \u2014 into the city, and I will do my best to bring a horse-load of \u2014 of food. So in the meantime, my mother was waiting in this country home with this deaf mute aunt. This \u2014 Kamaroula was very close to Agrinion. And a few hours later he returned, but without a horse-load of food, and explained to my mother that the Germans were very watchful now, that they did not allow any food to leave the city. And they had \u2014 they had executed resistance fighters already in the city, about 200 of them. So the situation had really become very hard, very tough. And they said, the only thing that I was able to bring from your friends, your neighbors, were tea, a bottle \u2014 a bottle of quinine tablets, and some matches. Very useful things, but not what we expected. So \u2014 so my mother took this me \u2014 these few items and started walking back to our city \u2014 to the village. And at one point she \u2014 she met Pepola(ph) Hannah(ph). He was a re \u2014 a Jewish resistance fighter, and he already knew Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Ninetta Feldman mc September 14, 2010 what had happened. So they fell into each other\u2019s arms and they cried and it was a very, very emotional experience for my mother. But she had to rush \u2014I should tell you that there were a lot of Jewish young men that had joined the resistance up in the mountains. They have left their \u2014 their families to \u2014 to save themselves, and they joined the resistance. Unfortunately, a number of them, they joined the resistance, the \u2014 the andartes, but then they were afraid of reprisals by the Germans against their families, and so they returned. But a number of them stayed in the mountains. So they had to rush to \u2014 Christos(ph) and my mother \u2014 th-the partisans did not allow anybody to walk after sundown, and it was close to sundown. So they climbed a hill, and at the top of the hill was a little chapel, a little church that Christos\u2019 grandfather had built. And so they spent the night there, and this was Saint Elias chapel. And then the next day they said goodbye, and there is my mother bearing this horrible news, alone, walking alone from this place, Kamaroula, all the way to Psilovrahos, bearing the news alone, and crying all the time. So when she came back, at that point my brother, my f\u2014 and my father were outdoors working on this plot of land that they gave us to cultivate, and when they saw her coming, she was walking very slowly, they started to laugh, and they said, didn\u2019t we tell you not to go? You came back \u2014 she came back three days later and she \u2014 she was planning to stay for seven or eight days in Agrinion. We told you not to go. And my mother was in terrible physical shape, bearing the horrible news and she said, don\u2019t laugh. Come in the house and when I tell you what happened, you will cry with bitter Interview with Ninetta Feldman \" September 14, 2010 tears. And so she told us, and we were \u2014 we were just devastated. And I remember this scene. I had never, ever seen my mother in that state. Her eyes were \u2014 her \u2014 her feet were swollen, her face was swollen, her eyes were red, and she was physically exhausted and emotionally just absolutely drained. So we were just \u2014 just \u2014 just shocked. It took us \u2014 took a long time for \u2014 to recover from this shock, and the only thing that sort of brought a ray of hope that sustained us was the possibility that they were taken to Krak\u00e9w, Poland, because that was the rumors that circulated when they deported the Jews of Salonika, that they were being relocated to \u2014 to Krakow to establish their own Jewish community, to be self-governed with their own mayor, to establish synagogues wherever they wanted. So we thought that th \u2014 these Jews as well, from Ioannina, Arta and Preveza, that that was their destination. And you know, my parents said, we have to do something, but \u2014 but what can we do in \u2014 we\u2019re in this remote village, what can we do? But my father knew that there was a contingent of the British mission in Greece in a nearby village, because the British, throughout the war, were there helping the war effort behind the scenes. Helping the resistance. The British were there helping the resistance, even though later on, after the war, the British were instrumental in preventing communism from becoming established in Greece. But we \u2014 my father knew of this British mission, and he said we \u2014 we \u2014 we have to contact them. We should write letters and we should send a letter to the \u2014 he said, the nations of the world have to know what\u2019s happening, they have to do something to stop it. We didn\u2019t really know what was \u2014 you know, anything about Interview with Ninetta Feldman \u00ae September 14, 2010 the Final Solution or what diabolic plans of the Nazis were at this point. So \u2014 so my father decided to write a letter addressed to the British government. And the letter, that was going to be delivered to my aunt and uncle, who resided in Alexandria in Egypt, and they in turn would give the letter to the Greek government in exile, which was in Egypt. It all sounds so naive now, but at the time it was a way of doing something. And so sure enough, my father composed these letters and \u2014 and my mother and brother again, were to deliver these letters to the village of Priantza. They didn\u2019t know where Priantza was, they had to \u2014 to ask many people to find their way to Priantza. So they finally arrive in Priantza and the \u2014 the British officials are willing to meet with them. And my mother, when she came back, she described that they \u2014 they walked into a large room, and they sat on two chairs, my brother and \u2014 and her, and facing these British officers, and they told them what had happened, and they \u2014 they begged them to deliver these letters. And the British officers, they accepted the letters, but they didn\u2019t sound very reassuring. In fact, one of them said to my mother, you know \u2014 and I don\u2019t know if it was his wife and children or \u2014 or some other relative, they \u2014 you know, my wife and children died in the bombing in London, and \u2014 and that \u2014 I have to bear that loss. So my mother was in tears because she felt they were not giving her any encouraging words. And so they left with my brother and felt that this was a fruitless mission. I don\u2019t know whether these letters were ever de-delivered to \u2014 to anybody. But one \u2014 one good thing that they discovered while in Priantza, there were a lot of parachute drops that they were \u2014 th-they Interview with Ninetta Feldman \u201d September 14, 2010 were delivering supplies to the British officers in the British mission, and \u2014 and so the villagers in Priantza had a lot of this material. So much of it they didn\u2019t know what to do with it. And so when my mother discovered that this material was plentiful, she went from house to house asking for some of this parachute material, it\u2019s like a dark, khaki kind of greenish fabric, and rope from the parachutes. And so when they returned home after their mission, my brother came into the hou \u2014 room with this big bundle of parachute material. And that was like gold for us, because my mother finally had fabric to sew dresses, blouses, and so on. But I \u2014 from what I recall, we did not dwell on this. Th- There weren\u2019t many discussions about this between my parents, about the deportation of the Jews. And \u2014 and th-the hope that we maintained throughout the war was that they were relocated to Poland, and when the war is over, they will return. We were \u2014 my parents were primarily concerned with my grandparents, because they were in their late years, and they were very concerned about them, if they would be \u2014 they\u2019II be able to survive. So then \u2014 so my mother started working again, sewing the dresses and blouses and resuming her bartering activities with my brother, from village to village. And that really was very, very helpful, because now it\u2019s summertime, the villagers have more food to exchange for \u2014 for dresses, and so the situation, the food situation improved with the \u2014 with the weather, you know, spring and summer.

And so we walked \u2014 we re \u2014 you walked to every place, you didn\u2019t take a mule or anything like this, it wasn\u2019t very far. And we went to Kremasta, and this place was just teeming with people. There were a lot of partisans, ardat \u2014 andartes, recuperating andartes. Many of them were injured, and they were recuperating there. There were villagers that had orthopedic problems, and they would \u2014 would \u2014 would come to Kremasta for the baths. The baths were supposed to cure everything. And my mother st \u2014 I remember her saying how people would come curled up in a basket on a mule, take the baths and then they would walk straight, you know, without the assistance of a cane or anything. I mean, there were miraculous cures. So we \u2014 we shared a room with another woman and her child, and we started going into these baths, they were constructed of cement, and they would get filled up with this water that was \u2014 smelled of sulfur, like rotten eggs. And my mother kept saying, well this is very good, you know. I couldn\u2019t bear the smell \u2014 this is \u2014 this is very good for you. And th-the following day my fa \u2014 my brother joined us, and it was a sort of a nice, little vacation. But unfortunately came to an abrupt end when the captain of the unit of the partisans that were stationed in Kremasta announced that th-the \u2014 first of all, the partisans had to go back to their units, wherever they belonged, and the villa \u2014 villagers had to go back home because the Germans were advancing towards that area. So, people panicked, they immediately stopped their baths and they started just a huge group of Interview with Ninetta Feldman \"\u00b0 September 14, 2010 people, some on canes or sticks \u2014 not canes, but sticks, or \u2014 or mules and horses, going back to their homes. And so when we reached the village with my mother and brother, the village was in a state of excitement, because this time all of the villagers were going to leave the village. They \u2014 with their animals, because the \u2014 at this point the Germans had become very aggressive towards the villagers, who at the beginning they were trying to appease, but now the villagers were supporting the resistance by providing them with shelter and food and so these \u2014 th-the Germans were carrying out retaliations against the villagers by executing them, or burning the villages. So that was known, and so everybody was leaving the village with their animals. And my father was in the process of baking bread in the \u2014"

            "answer": "\u2014 his famous homemade oven. And there was no time for the bread to \u2014 to \u2014 to bake completely. This reminds me of the exodus from Egypt, with Moses. And \u2014 and now we, again we pack as many things as we possibly could. And this time we don\u2019t have any mules to transport things, so we have to travel light, with one blanket and very few food supplies. And so everybody is leaving the village, and this time we go to another \u2014 a place much higher than the earlier place of Chiandafelis. This place is called Kamaria. And so the entire village, with their animals, they camp this plateau at the top of the mountain, which offered a very good vantage point view of the villages below, not only Psilovrahos but the other surrounding villages. And so there we are, it\u2019s August, the sun Interview with Ninetta Feldman \" September 14, 2010 is burning, there\u2019s no \u2014 they \u2014 we \u2014 we had brought the canteen, a small canteen full of water, but it was very quickly exhausted. The villagers knew of a \u2014 a spring, which my brother used to fill up the canteen again, but still not enough water. The villagers, because they knew the terrain very well, and they were used to this rough terrain, they were able to discover other sources of water, but \u2014 but not us. So my father actually had to \u2014 to go from villager to villager begging for a little bit of water to fill the canteen. And I remember we were allowed only three gulps of water, you know, no more, because it had to last. The other problem was that we didn\u2019t have \u2014 we brought only one blanket and it was very cold at night up at the top of the mountain, so my father borrowed a blanket from one of the villagers. And we decided \u2014 my parents decided that it would be best if we didn\u2019t stay with the rest of the villagers, but went to a secluded place, so in case the Germans came to Kamaria, they wouldn\u2019t find us. So again we were separated, we were separated from the rest of the villagers, and we found a secluded place and my mother or father or Mykas(ph) caught a goat, a stray goat, and we milked it. So we had a little bit of milk. And so we \u2014 we stayed in this place. Now, my mother was in \u2014 she was sick, she had fever, she was in very, very bad shape, because she had gone to \u2014 to Kremasta to recuperate from her ordeals, and now, all of a sudden, she has to go up to the mountains again. And I \u2014 I remember this \u2014 my brother doesn\u2019t remember this, but my \u2014 but I do \u2014 my mother saying, if the Germans come here, Mykas(ph) will take Ninetta, climb a rock and then a tree. And Father should hide somewhere, and I will throw all of our Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Ninetta Feldman = September 14, 2010 belongings off this \u2014 on the \u2014 off the precipice and I will get all \u2014 you know, fall off the precipice as well, not to leave a trace of our presence there. And for me, you know my mother, who was a pillar of strength, to say such thing was a very \u2014 a very shaky \u2014 shook me up. And probably that\u2019s the reason why I remember it. So we \u2014 from \u2014 from this location, we were able to see fires being set on the villages below. And it was, you know, one village after the other being set on fire, systematically. And they had reached our village, Psilovrahos, and they began to burn those houses as well. And \u2014 and it was \u2014 it was horrible, because these people were very poor to begin with, and now they\u2019re losing \u2014 to lose their house and their household, it \u2014 it was awful. But then, suddenly, the fire stopped \u2014 the sa \u2014 fires in Psilovrahos. They had burned a few houses, but then the \u2014 the f\u2014 the fire stopped. And we didn\u2019t know what had happened, but later on \u2014 in fact, on my last visit to Psilovrahos in 2005, some of the villagers told me what had happened. One of the villagers, his name was Bulumbashez(ph), a-an old, elderly person, became so infuriated with what was happening, that he defied the danger and he started coming down the m \u2014 the mountain with his cane and he had binoculars, creating a lot of commotion as the rocks were tumbling down, and the two Germans with the torches that were setting the houses on fire, they thought that the andartes were coming down. An- And so they stopped and left. And \u2014 and so this man really saved the village from \u2014 from being burned to the ground. So it \u2014 there\u2019s so many things that I learned afterwards, and at the time \u2014 Interview with Ninetta Feldman \u2122 September 14, 2010"

Because she would sell dresses to people who didn\u2019t have wheat, but with a promise that when Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Ninetta Feldman \"\u00b0 September 14, 2010 they harvest, they would \u2014 she would be paid at harvest time. So now we have quite a bit of wheat to transport into the city. So \u2014 so my brother and \u2014 and this Baba(ph) Yoros(ph) and the mule, or horse, I don\u2019t know what it was, they come down into the city. I \u2014 I- I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m glad that I\u2014 you asked me this question, because I didn\u2019t say anything about Baba(ph) Yoros(ph). There was a time, after the first time that \u2014 which was in November \u2014 when we had to leave Psilovrahos and go to Chiandafelis\u2019 house. There was another time when we had to leave the village. I don\u2019t remember which month it was, but this time my father and Mykas(ph) decided to leave the village, but my mother decided to stay, to guard whatever food we had. So my mother and I stayed in the house, and we were joined by the wife of Mr. Lavee(ph), her name was [indecipherable], and she spoke German, and at one point she actually spoke with the Germans, and she claims that she protected the upper village of Psilovrahos from the Germans. I don\u2019t know, this is a story that I\u2019m not very clear on. But \u2014 so my mother and I slept in the room, and then early next morning we hear a knock on the door. And we woke up, and there was Baba(ph) Yoros(ph), who was a neighbor, he was a retired policeman, and his son was a partisan. And Baba(ph) Yoros(ph) said to my mother, what are you doing here with your child? If the Germans were to come to the village and \u2014 and take you and your child, I will never, ever forgive myself. And so when my mother heard that, she ha \u2014 didn\u2019t have to hear anything more, she packed quickly and \u2014 and \u2014 and she packed more than \u2014 than she could carry, and she \u2014 in her memoir she says how she \u2014 she didn\u2019t want to leave the Interview with Ninetta Feldman \u201d September 14, 2010 \u2014 the things that she packed, which was food and \u2014 and a blanket, but at the same time she realized that she couldn\u2019t carry it. And at that point, Mrs. Tsulamitsu(ph), this \u2014 the \u2014 the mother of this \u2014 of the seven daughters who my mother was tutoring and knitting and crocheting and making lace, she appeared with her mule, and \u2014 and she saw my mother in \u2014 in this \u2014 in distress, and she said, oh don\u2019t worry, I will carry all of your belongings. And so, with her, we reached the upper village, and \u2014 and so this is how we stand this time when the \u2014 the Germans \u2014 that was their second foray into our region, but this time they never reached the village, and \u2014 and so \u2014 and so we all returned. So this is Baba(ph) Yoros(ph) who played a significant part in \u2014 in our story. As I said, th-the people really \u2014 they tried to \u2014 to help in any way they \u2014 they could, including th-the priest. You know, we \u2014 we used to go to the church, first of all to \u2014 not to show that we were any different than the other villagers, and also to eat some food there, because whenever there was a \u2014 a memorial service, they would serve koliva, which is a mixture of boiled wheat and pomegranates, cinnamon and sugar. It\u2019s a very nutritious, delicious thing, but we\u2019d go there and \u2014 and the relatives of the deceased would give everybody a handful of this and so there was another source of food for us. And the priest, I don\u2019t remember his name. Papa Demetrius(ph), perhaps. I don\u2019t remember his name. He used to come to our house quite often, because he befriended my parents. And my mother would always serve him coffee, which was a rare find, a ra \u2014 a re \u2014 a real treat for him. And he would chat with my father. I don\u2019t know what they talked about, but we went to \u2014 attended even Easter 100 Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 services \u2014 Friday, Good Friday services. And this is the ttme when \u2014 I learned later on, you know, after the war, I \u2014 I used to go to the church with my friends a lot. And so as I said earlier, I knew a lot more about the Christian religion than \u2014 than the Jewish religion. But on Fridays, when Jesus has been crucified and \u2014 and he\u2019s dead, and the priest is supposed to exhort his flock to \u2014 to move them, that this wonderful human being sacrificed his \u2014 his life t-to save you. He\u2019s \u2014 and so he would \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he would ha \u2014 he had to give a sermon to make people cry, especially the old women cry, and so he had to go on and on with the crucifixion and the pain that he suffered on the cross. And so Sunday they celebrated Easter, the resurrection, he came to our house and apologized to my parents for having to give this kind of sermon in front of us. So 1-it was, of course, appreciated by my parents. He was a kind man, and he said, what can I do? I\u2019m expected to do that, I\u2019m expected to give this kind of sermon. So now, go back to my brother and Baba(ph) Yoros(ph), they\u2019re returning to the villa \u2014 to Agrinion. And so my \u2014 my brother arrived with \u2014 with food, to Agrinion. And then, after a few days, my parents and I came down into the city."

And when I was visiting Nina, I remember she \u2014 I stayed with her f-for a number of days, and every morning she would serve breakfast, and I wanted to ask her \u2014 and every morning I\u2019d say no, maybe she \u2014 she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. Until at one point, I don\u2019t remember exactly how it came up, she said to me, you know, I was interviewed by Steven Spielberg\u2019s project. And \u2014 and I said, you did? A-And \u2014 and \u2014 and I \u2014 and this was the first time that I realized that she had talked about it. This is in Ioannina now, there used to be \u2014 there used to be two synagogues before the war. One was demolished and the adjacent school, the Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle was torn down, and they used that spot \u2014 land to build an apartment house for the Jews from Ioannina who survived either by going up in the mountains, or concentration camp survivors. And they live in that apartment house on Josef Elijia Street. And that is the name of \u2014 of a Greek Jewish poet from Ioannina, they named the street after him. But the \u2014 the horrible thing that I discovered on \u2014 after I made a tour of the \u2014 of the neighborhood where my aunt \u2014 my cousin pointed out all the houses of our relatives. This Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Ninetta Feldman m September 14, 2010 is where Aunt ri\u2014 Annetta(ph) and Aunt Eftyhia lived, and where my grandparents lived. When I returned to the apartment house, I saw this graffiti written in an ungrammatical way, saying, you die at 17 and we bury you at 70. It was obviously an anti-Semitic graffiti on this building that houses the remnants of that thriving community. This is a community that numbered 2,000 \u2014 almost 2,000 Jews. An ancient community that had existed there for many, many centuries. And there are th \u2014 a handful of people who live in this apartment house with painful memories, and they have to \u2014 to read this every day. So I asked her, why don\u2019t you \u2014 why don\u2019t you hire somebody to erase it? And said, we do it, and \u2014 and they come back, and they come back. I-It was \u2014 so my \u2014 my knowledge of concentration camps was not from our relatives that survived, yes."

I mean, is that where some of your memories come from? Or it is mainly from the memoirs that they wrote?",
            "answer": "They always talked about our adventure in the mountains, always. And they didn\u2019t put it down on paper until they were in the United States already. And it was really, as my father says in his memoirs, always the driving force behind us. Because by then my brother had two daughters, and I had the daughter, and we realized that they had this treasure of information that should be recorded. And so we both, ma \u2014 my brother Mykas(ph) and I urged them to \u2014 to write down their memoirs. And I promised my father Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Ninetta Feldman m September 14, 2010 I was going to translate them, and I did. But my mother, I do remember the stories she came back with after her first visit of Ioannina, when she went to visit her sisters\u2019 house, Eftyhia and Annetta(ph), they were both married, and they had, each of them, two daughters. And they \u2014 and she said that the neighbors \u2014 there was also a woman, Stavrypoulo(ph) I believe, who occupied my aunts\u2019 house at the time, and she was a mistress of one of the German officers who lived in my aunt\u2019s house, Aunt Eftyhia\u2019s house. And my aunt \u2014 my uncle \u2014 Aunt Eftyhia\u2019s husband Naseem(ph) Samwheel(ph) was a dentist, and they were well-off, they had a very pretty house, very comfortable. And so the German officer chose to \u2014 their \u2014 that house to live in. And my aunt would serve him meals every day. She was actually expecting a child, and yet she had to go up and down to serve him. And my mother learned this story when she came to Ioannina that first visit after the war, that the \u2014 this German officer asked my aunt to bring more wine that na \u2014 particular night. And she said, tomorrow we don\u2019t know who lives and who dies. And so she brought more wine, it was a very sumptuous meal that she had prepared. And it was the very next day, March 21% \u2014 25\" \u2014 March 25\", when they rounded up the Jews of Ioannina \u2014 of Ioannina. They had to be awakened very early in the morning. It was an unusually cold day, it was actually snowing. And \u2014 and they knocked the door very early in the morning, 5:30 in the morning, people were still sleeping, and they told them, you have, you know, 60 minutes to pack and assemble in the sert \u2014 in a square by the \u2014 by the lake, Pamvotis Lake, of Ioannina. And this is what Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 113 Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 they did, and \u2014 and so my aunt \u2014 this 1s all totally unexpected, because up until that point, things were relatively calm in the city, and so this was an unsuspecting Jewish population that all of a sudden is rounded up. And so my aunt approached the \u2014 this German officer, and said, we too? You know, you lived with us, and I served you so many meals, we too? He said, yes, you too. And my uncle was still shaving, and it was a very \u2014 a horrible situa \u2014a horrible scene that my mother described. And now in retrospect, when I think \u2014 when I think of it, it\u2019s very, very painful. Because I can \u2014 I can just picture now my grandparents being awakened early in the morning, in their later years 1n their lives; small children, pregnant women, they had to \u2014 to pack. What \u2014 what could \u2014 they didn\u2019t know what to pack, what to bri \u2014 they didn\u2019t know where they were going. And when I bring that scene in my mind, I \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s so painful, so painful. And then my grandmother was a very kind person. She was \u2014 she had many children and she was a self-trained midwife. And she was a \u2014 and \u2014 and my grandfather had a lot of transactions with the villagers, because he used to buy milk from them. So she would \u2014 so they had a lot of people that they knew in the villages, and whenever a woman was expecting a child, they would always ask my mother \u2014 my grandmother to come and help her deliver the baby. So my grandmother would always go around the neighborhood collecting baby clothes and food for \u2014 for the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the mother, the young mother and the baby. And so she was that kind of person. And why was she taken away\u201d? There was a \u2014 a book that someone wrote, I can\u2019t remember her name right now, about the Jewish community of 114 Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 Ioannina, and the deportation. And she interviewed survivors that were brought in in the same \u2014 the same truck with my grandmother. No, actually the same \u2014 they were transported by trucks from Ioannina to Larisa(ph), and from Larisa(ph) in boxcars to Auschwitz. And these women survived the concentration camps and they were interviewed by the author of this book, and they happened to be riding in the same boxcar. And their \u2014 a relative of theirs was expecting a baby, and her mother-in-law was frantic, because what are we going to do? How 1s the \u2014 the mother and the baby going to survive? And \u2014 and they quoted my grandmother, saying, d-don\u2019t worry, Ill deliver the baby. I know all about babies, I\u2019ll take care of you. So I don\u2019t know whether she delivered \u2014 whether she delivered the baby in the boxcar, or when they arrived in the concentration camp. But I do know that they were among the first people to \u2014 to go to the gas chambers, because they \u2014 they had \u2014 they \u2014 they took the elderly and the very young to the gas chambers. And so that was the end of these wonderful people. It\u2019s something [indecipherable] my brother and I live with this \u2014 this pain all our lives. And it\u2019s just \u2014 there\u2019s no \u2014 there\u2019s just no answer, there\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s no answer, and \u2014 and what makes it so painful for \u2014 for us 1s that there was a possibility they could have been s \u2014 they could have survived, they could have \u2014 it was late enough in the war. The countryside was free. The partisans were there. They could ha \u2014 Greece is a mountainous country, they could have left, they could have survived. And it didn\u2019t happen. It \u2014 it\u2019s a\u2014 we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll just never \u2014 we\u2019ll never rest. I-It\u2019s a pain we\u2019ll never \u2014 always carry with us. When I went to 115 Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 Ioannina in 2005, I went to the synagogue, the only remaining synagogue inside the \u2014 the walls, the castle, th-the frourio, as they call it, that\u2019s still standing there, and it was renovated thanks to the generosity of American women o-of that background. And the walls are lined with marble plaques on which the names of all the victims, all the people who were deported, on marble plaques with the day of \u2014 the date of their birth \u2014 the names and the date of their birth. And th-the entire synagogue interior is \u2014 1s covered with these plaques. It was my Uncle Mikhail(ph) that the \u2014 a younger brother of my father, wa \u2014 he\u2019s a survivor of the concentration camp, he\u2019s the one who collected all the information; the names, the occupations, date of births of all the people who perished, and then they etched their names in marble an-and \u2014 and there is a \u2014 it\u2019s a\u2014a good monument, you know, a way to remember them. But it 1s \u2014 it is so painful to think \u2014 when I was in that synagogue, I \u2014 I had already learned a lot about the history of \u2014 of the community, and how rich their lives were, rich in \u2014 in long traditions, they \u2014 these unchanged traditions for hundreds of years. And it all perished overnight, literally overnight. So with \u2014 with my aunt \u2014 with my cousin Nina, when we were in the synagogue, and Mr. Samwheel(ph), who joined the partisans during the war, and this is how he survived, he joined them as a young man. Now, when I visited he was an elderly person. But he \u2014 he had a beautiful voice, and he knew how to play a musical instrument. And he took it upon himself to \u2014 to learn the liturgy, because he\u2019s the one who condu \u2014 conducts services in the synagogue, only very few times, on like Yom Kippur. That is 116 Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 when relatives and friends from other cities in Greece, they come to the synagogue. And so \u2014 so he \u2014 he chants the liturgy. And while we were there, the three of us; my cousin Nina, a survivor of Auschwitz; he, a partisan; and I, we recited Kaddish. And it was the most memorable moment of my life. And when I looked at the wall, there were the names of our relatives, and \u2014 and cousins that were my age when they were taken. And I s-sort of \u2014I\u2014I-\u2014TI appreciate life. I\u2019m very conscious that I was \u2014 I was just very, very, very lucky to survive. So I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m one of the very few \u2014 among the very few Greek Jewish survivors. And \u2014 and now I\u2019m \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 I\u2019m eternally grateful to whoever ever helped us to survive those terrible years. And there were many people with small acts of \u2014 of \u2014 just a kind word here and there, or giving us a sip of water up in Kamaria, or \u2014 or the blanket, 1n spite of the lice, they \u2014 they shared everything they had, and I am \u2014 we\u2019re the \u2014 eternally grateful t-to them an-and to the place of Psilovrahos. Psilovrahos is a very special, special, very special place for me. I\u2019m sorry."

So when my Aunt Rebecca, who was my father\u2019s youngest sister, and she and her family survived in Egypt, see, because they lived in Alexandria during the war, then after the [indecipherable] took over, and they had to \u2014 to leave Egypt, they came to Paris. Well, she came to visit us about maybe 10 years ago. And she had left Ioannina when she was 17 years old. She got married to my Uncle Laylee(ph), and then they moved to \u2014 to Alexandria, Egypt. So she would come back to visit her family. So she retained that period of \u2014 of \u2014 of the family as though it was encased in amber.

And she was a very articulate person and she loved to talk and I spent a lot of time with her. And then one day I realized, she 1s a treasure trove of information. And so I asked her if she would be willing for me to interview her 118 Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 using the family album. And even though it was \u2014 I know it was painful for her to talk about her brothers and their families and her sister that perished, an-and her parents, she \u2014 she let me interview her. I was not a professional interviewer, of course, but I \u2014 I really treasure the information that she gave me, because for a brief period of time, she brought these people to life.
