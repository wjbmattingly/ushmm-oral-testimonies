            "answer": "Yes. So we \u0152 we didn\u2122t know where to go \u0152 coming back to the story. And at that time there were two resistance movement in Greece. One was based in the countryside in Epirus, near Ioannina , the outskirts of Ioannina . EDES was headed by Napoleon Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 26Zervas , and they were known as the \u0152 but, at that time, the country was polarized between the \u0152 the nationalists, the right wing people, and the leftists. And so the resistance movements were also polarized. You have EDES, headed by Napoleon Zervas in Epirus, and then EAM-ELAS, much larger, very well organized resistance movement in the countryside of Greece, but also within the cities of \u0152 of Greece. And so we had neighbors, friends, who advised us to go to EDES, and other friends who advised us to go to a territory controlled by EAM-ELAS. So we had some very close family friends, the Bokoros family; there were three brothers and two sisters, actually three sisters. There was Christos and Thermas(ph) Bokoros , and we knew them, we became fam \u0152 we became family friends because their sister Elestair(ph) was married to a man who was a colleague of my father\u2122s in \u0152 in the bank. I think we met \u0152 they met them either in Preveza or Arta, I don\u2122t know. And unfor tunately her husband, Elestair\u2122s husband died, and the whole family moved to Agrinion and they lived \u0152 and so she and her children lived with her brothers, Christos and Thermas (ph) and Kostas Bokoros . So, we decided to ask them fo r help, and they were wonderful people, they did everything they could to assure us that we\u2122ll find you a place, we\u2122ll get you out of the city. And so after we distributed our belongings to the ne ighbors, my mother, my brother and I, we \u0152 we sent some of the material, clothing and fo od and household utensils, with a porter to transport these things to the Bokoros \u2122 house, and then we, the th ree of us, my mother, my brother and I followed behind. My father went to work that day, he had to \u0152 they received Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 27a very large amount of money, and he was re placing the \u0152 the cashier, so he had to go there and to count the money. And so we reached the Bokoro \u0152 Bokoros \u2122 house, and a few minutes later \u0152 I remember this very vividly, I know this is a firsthand recollection. I remember a German bursting into the house and \u0152 and then my mother, you know, she saw this \u0152 she saw him, and she quickly push ed him in \u0152 pushed me into the adjacent room and she quickly pulled the covers off the bed, and pretended to calmly make the bed, as though she belonged there. She\u2122s a very quick thinker, sh \u0152 amazing person. So th-the \u0152 the German sort of looked around. I don\u2122t \u0152 we don\u2122t know what \u0152 who he was looking for, and then he left. But it was a very frightening experience for \u0152 for \u0152 for all \u0152 for my mother and \u0152 and my brother. I don\u2122 t remember where my brother was at this point. All I remember was my mother maki ng the bed at this point. And she asked Christos, one of the Bokoros brothers to quickly go to the bank and tell my father to \u0152 to drop everything and come to the house, we had to leave immediately. So Christos goes to the bank, and told my father that \u0152 does he have \u0152 even though you haven\u2122t finished counting the money, you have to drop everythi ng and leave. An-And certainly the people in the bank were very coopera tive. They signed everything as though they had cou \u0152 as the mon \u0152 as though the money had been coun ted and everything, or the transaction was very orderly. And so my father comes to the Bokoros house. And then, where there\u2122s another problem they confront is the la ck of transportation. The Germans had requisitioned all means of trans portation; trucks, taxis, mules, horses. And so the brothers Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 28couldn\u2122t find a way for us to leave that day, which was October seco nd. And so we spent the night in their house, and the following day they came with a taxi. They found a taxi that was going to Kremasta. This was a spa near the river Acheloos river, nearby. Was so-some distance, few kilometers outside Agrinion. And he had \u0152 the taxi driver had other passengers to transport to the \u0152 the the Acheloos spa. And so this is we \u0152 we got in the taxi with some blankets, and you know, some household ma \u0152 equipment, materials that we brought with us, and so we left the city. I remember that, I remember how my mother said we should crouch into the \u0152 the taxi, not to draw attention to ourselves, because people did not use taxis then to \u0152 to \u0152 to move around, we didn\u2122t want to \u0152 to draw attention to ourselves. And then as soon as we \u0152 we came to the outskirts of the city of Agrinion , we had to pass through a German checkpoint. And the driver, who apparently did this route quite often, he knew how to deal with the German guards there, and he gave them some raisins and cigare ttes, and they let us pass. And then \u0152"

Now, I\u2122m not sure whether we got a goat at this point, or later on, I\u2122m not sure. But I remember that for me, getting a goat was the dream of my life. It was a goat of my own, and the \u0152 and it was really a \u0152 in orde r for us to have a source of milk. And th-the goat spent most of the time with the Tsulamitsu (ph) family, they were very nice, very hospitable, kind, generous people.

I Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 42was going to school, my brother had brought hi s high school books, and my father said, you should start studying. And my father had brought a book of English method \u0152 how \u0152 a method to learn English without a teacher. I remember that book. My brother has it \u0152 still has it. And \u0152 and of course my mother didn\u2122t need any \u0152 any additional work. She really had to work very hard because ther e was \u0152 she had to do the laundry and the cooking and all the washing of the dishes, without \u0152 without a stove, without running water.

And so we didn\u2122t felt comfortable at that point, and my father started writing letters to our rel-relatives in Ioannina, urging them to leave the city and \u0152 and go to the mount ains. And we used friends t-to \u0152 to transport these letters from \u0152 from the village of Psilovrahos to a colleague of my father\u2122s, Evyanea (ph) Papadapoulou (ph) I believe was her name. And she would in turn send the letters to her sister or brother in Ioannina, and they would deliver th em to our relatives. And everything was written in code, and we never used the word Psilovrahos , it was our \u0152 it was a code word like, our place in the mountai ns, or our vacation place. And so we were urging them to leave, and the reply was that everything is fine here . We have plenty of food, and they were actually worried about the children catching cold up in the mountains, because at that time, the ger \u0152 th ere \u0152 there was no indication of anything was going to happen to them now. Ioannina, or Ioannina at this point is occupied by the Germans, but there was no indication that anyt hing bad was going to happen.

By that time there were two more Jewish men who had ended up in Psilovrahos , they had come from another city, I believe Helkese(ph). And of course you know we were \u0152 my parents, they panicked. They \u0152 they were advised to go to a higher place up in the mountains. And we arranged with a mule driver to come the following morning, to transport us to this higher place. And I remember th-the \u0152 oh well, during the night \u0152 during the night , was a very frightful night, because we didn\u2122t know whether the Germans were advancin g during the night, but there was a big explosion, a distant explosion. We didn\u2122t know where it was coming from. I should say that when Yonas Mionis came to alert us of the advance of the Germans, there was there \u0152 the church bells started to ring alarm, and these young men of EPON was calling everybody to his feet, and urging able-bodied me n to take their weapons, rifles, whatever they had, and go to Agios Vlassis to stop advance of the Germans. So, Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 44the following morning, this mule driver arrives and \u0152 and now again, I don\u2122t know whether I heard my mother say that, or I heard her say that much later, but it impressed me that these \u0152 what kind of mules are these? These are just a \u0152 they look like big \u0152 big dogs; they were very small. And of course, we were very grateful that there was a means of transportation, so we loaded a few \u0152 a few things and along with the other Jewish men, we started climbing the mountain. Now, this part I know is firsthand experience. I remember my mother saying \u0152 I was getting tired, and my mother kept saying, keep walking, keep walking, you have to \u0152 beca use I was behind everybo dy. And I don\u2122t know whether she said the Germans are coming, but all she was urging me to walk faster. And so it \u0152 it was a \u0152 it was a rainy day, and I reme mber my mother insist ed that we all wear extra clothing for warmth, and finally we reache d a house, this mule driver took us to the house of a man called Chiandafelis (ph). It was a \u0152 th-there were no other houses there, just his house. And of course, he opens the door, sees this unlikely group of people, city people at his doorstep, he didn\u2122t know what was going on. And \u0152 and it was revealed that \u0152 that wi \u0152 th-the \u0152 the mule driver told him who we were and why we were there. So they probably \u0152 he probably told them that we are Jewish, and that the Germans were advancing. I \u0152 I don\u2122t know exactly what he told him. But when the man, Mr. Chiandafelis (ph) heard the word Agrinion , he became very excited, because he told us that his daughter Theandafela(ph) was working for a family in Agrinion, the family of Davaroukas(ph). And it so happened that Davaroukas (ph) was a colleague of my Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 45father\u2122s in the National Bank of Greece. So he became very excited, because my father told him, oh I know your daughter, she came to the bank several times, and I know her, she is a very nice girl. And you see, a lot of villagers would send their daughters into the city to work as maids in hope that they would learn to grow \u0152 to learn \u0152 acquire some skills with city people. They would take them out of school and they would work as maids to bring some income for the family, and also learn to be nice young ladies, the way city people were.

But then there was this incident of my brother seeing this group of men and horses or mules ascending this precipice and she panicked and said, oh the Germans are coming, and created a lot of panic among all of us, because in addition to my family, there were now three additional Jewish men; one of them was Yonas Mionis, the resistance leader. And we all dispersed behind rocks, behind trees and that is when \u0152 oh, and then Mr. Chiandafelis(ph) sent his son, Spyros down the mountain to see who these people were and he discovered just villagers returning to their homes. But then they recognized that we were terrified of the possibility of being discovered by the Germans, and so they rec \u0152 Chiandafelis(ph) recommended that we spend the day in this cave, called Arapo(ph). Kefalas(ph), and \u0152 and the night at his house. And that\u2122s exactly what we did, this Spyros , Mr. Chiandafelis\u2122 son guided us to the \u0152 to the cave, and that again, I have a firsthand recollection. I remember this very vividly as a child going into a cave. It was quite an experience, and I was \u0152 I was frightened. I was frightened at first, because it was so dark, especially, you know, before our eyes adjusted to the darkness, it was very dark, and there was all kinds of formations of stalactites and stalagmites. And my father Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 56found a little ledge on the side, sort of halfway into the cave. It was like an alcove, and we spread the blankets, and the four of us huddled together in this dark cave. And \u0152 and my father, he \u0152 he always tried to calm ever ybody down, and \u0152 and he \u0152 this a \u0152 he\u2122s a \u0152 was a very good storyteller. So he would tell us different kinds of stories about his exploits, ab \u0152 as a soldier goi ng up to the \u0152 to the front, the Albanian \u0152 Greek Albanian front or \u0152 and then Bible stories, lots of Bible stories, which he embellished greatly to entertain us. And I don\u2122t know whether this is \u0152 actually happened. I don\u2122t know he \u0152 he \u0152 he \u0152 whether he explained to m \u0152 to us how these structures are formed in the cave. I-I don\u2122t remember whether he explained, but I have a feeling that he did, but I\u2122m not positive. And so, it was hours that we had to s \u0152 to spend in this alcove, in the dark \u0152 semi-darkness. We could hear the dripping of the water in the back, as the water mixed with minerals, would drip down into a \u0152 a pond at the bottom of the \u0152 of the cave. And then suddenly we hear somebody call my father, you know, Mr. Matsas , Mr. Matsas. And we were frightened because we thought somebody discovered us. And so we decided not to \u0152 to say anything, to ke ep quiet. But the voice persisted, Mr. Matsas, Mr. Matsas, then he said I\u2122m \u0152 this is Spyros . Come out, come out, it\u2122s safe, it\u2122s calm, this is Spyros , Chiandafelis\u2122(ph) son. And \u0152 and I don\u2122t rememb er whether we came out, or the people outside came in, I don\u2122t remember. But later on my father said that he was afraid at first that they were going to throw a grenade, because at first we thought there were Germans, enemies. But what we discovered when we \u0152 we met th e two people that Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 57Spyros had brought there, these were two othe r Jewish men who were seeking shelter, like we were. They were in Agios Vlassis and when the Germans a dvanced, at that point they left and they came to Psilovrahos , and then they were told that this Jewish family up \u0152 there\u2122s another family up in \u0152 hiding up higher in the mountains. So now Mr. Chiandafelis (ph) had several people to feed every night. But we decided that the villa \u0152 the \u0152 the cave was not safe either, so my father searched in the forest for a secluded place. And so we decided to spend the day in this se cluded place, and the nights at the house."

And my father tried to calm her down, that we will send a man down in the village, in the \u0152 in Agrinion to get some food from the bank. And this is somethi ng we did, but the man came back with one small ca \u0152 one can of oil, that was all he could bring, because he was bringing food supplies for his family, and that was the only additional weight for the mule to carry. But I was friends with the \u0152 the children of the owner of the house, and they told me one day, oh \u0152 they were boasting, oh, we have so mu ch food now. We have rice and beans, we have \u0152 we even have candles. We have things that we ne ver had before. And I \u0152 I was very impressed, and I reported this to my pare nts, you know, I said the \u0152 my friends, they told me they have all this good stuff. And immediately my parents suspected that the owner of the house was the one who looted th e room, and my father confronted him, and he denied that he \u0152 he took anything. And my father persiste d, and he had to accept to \u0152 the fact that \u0152 he had to admit that he did ta ke a few things. He was afraid of my father talking about this to the village, and that he was going to be embarrassed. And so he returned a few items. But my parents knew that he probably had a lot more, and was hidden somewhere. And so my father searched the \u0152 the barn and other hidden \u0152 possible Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 63places where he could have hidden food, and sure enough they \u0152 he found a can of oil. And oil was a real treasure, because was \u0152 this is olive oil, was very hard to find, very valuable, if you were going to use it as a commodity to exchange it for other kinds of food. So my parents were infuriated with this man because he \u0152 he really \u0152 he created the situation that we \u0152 we were trying to avoid, a nd that is lack of food in the winter. So they considered bringing this matter to the people\u2122s court. There were people\u2122s courts then, in villages. They were not official courts, but they were \u0152 consisted of the elders of the village, and all sorts of ma \u0152 matters of \u0152 disputes were brought to the people\u2122s court. And the people\u2122s court was actually very severe in punishments that \u0152 that they imposed on people. So my parents reconsidered that, because they were afraid he would be, who knows, imprisoned, or some very severe pu nishment; he had a young family, so they decided to drop the matter. And that they also didn\u2122t want to draw attention to ourselves. So they dropped the matter, and at this point we had to leave that room, and we went to another house to live in. This was very similar to the one we occupied the first time. This one had two rooms, one room was a kafeneio , a caf\u00e9. And the other room was the room that we occupied, and th \u0152 and it had a base ment. And so \u0152 so that was a big change, it was \u0152 we adjusted to it very quickly. But the main concern now was food. There was a family by the name Yovanos(ph) who lived in Agrinion , but had come to the village for the summer, and they stayed on because of the \u0152 the war situation. But they had decided to return to Agrinion . And they had a lot of wheat with them. So my father, being a bank Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 64employee, he conducted a transaction not with checks, but with wheat. He told him, if you give us your wheat that is here, you can collect our wh eat, which is stored in the bank. It was an exchange, and no wheat had to travel to Agrinion or from Agrinion to Psilovrahos , but it was a transaction that s-seemed reasonable to him, and he gave us a certain amount of wheat. But he had more whea t, but this other villager that was wealthy, who could have cooperated at this poi nt and \u0152 and he could have made the Yovanos (ph) wheat available to us, he decided not to do that, and he ke pt the wheat for \u0152 for himself. And that was a very callous thing to do, and he, years later when \u0152 after the war, the man recognized that he had done something very, very bad, and he came to my father and my parents and \u0152 and asked them for their forgiveness, because by \u0152 by not agreeing to make this wheat available to us, he made life absolutely horrible for the family. So \u0152 so th-that is the situation now, we are \u0152 we have very little food. We do have this oil that the villager brings from the village, and this wheat. Then my mother started exchanging sugar for a certain kind of cereal that is called Trachanas . It\u2122s a \u0152 a coarsely ground wheat mixed with milk that is \u0152 that \u0152 that is in a dry state and when you add some milk, it expands, and it\u2122s a very nutritious food and very filling. So \u0152 so this is what my mother started doing, exchanging sugar for \u0152 for Trachanas or corn meal. Then some of the villagers would give us some eggs from the chickens, some milk, a piece of cheese. It was a very difficult situation and there\u2122s wint er approaching, it\u2122s already winter. It is cold. And so then, my mother, wh-who is a very resourceful person, she decided that \u0152 Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 65that she is going to barter clothing, our pers onal clothes, for food. And so she became a peddler, and she went with my 13 year old brother from village to village, exchanging clothing for food. Or, she did other things. She knitted for people. She was \u0152 she had many skills. She knew how to make lace. An-And one \u0152 one thought came to her mind is that the girls in the village, they want to prepare their dowry, and I can teach them how to \u0152 to knit. I di \u0152 can teach them how to embroider, how to make lace, and so \u0152 and said, there are a lot of girls in the village who would want this, and they would exchange my services for food. And the one family that I mentioned earlier, the Tsulamitsu(ph) family, they had seven daughters. They had prepare seven dowries. So she went to \u0152 started with them. And she\u2122d go there every day and help them, show them how to embroider, how to make lace and so on, in exchange for cheese or br ead or whatever they had. So they ha \u0152 my parents had to start rationing the food. It was less and less every day. And I \u0152 I remember it was winter, still winter, and there were some mulberry trees and fig trees. There are a lot of mulberry trees and fig trees in Greece. And my mother said, you know, when these, you know, these fig trees, when spring and summer come, th-they\u2122ll be full of figs. And so I remember this game very vividl y, you know, walking underneath those trees, waiting for some day to see figs up on the tree."

            "answer": "The money was worthless, yes, yes. One wonderful thing happened during this period of \u0152 of, literally, starvation. A group of partisans, or andartes , as they were known, they came to the village and they camped there, they \u0152 they settled there for 20 days. There were 60 of them. I don\u2122t know why they settled in the village, but my parents recognized there was an opportunity for us to get food. And it was either my father or brother who approached the captain of this band, and desc ribed our desperate situation and asked them if they could help us. And the captain agreed to give us the equivalent of two portions of a \u0152 of food for one partisan, for the four of us to share. And so my brother, when the \u0152 the bugle was sounded, he could go there with a pot, and they would give him the portion of \u0152 of a partisan, which was not very much. It wa s just corn soup and a piece of corn bread. But for us it was God sent. And he did that tw ice a day, and we would share the food, and \u0152 and that was for 20 days. That was quite a \u0152 a long time. So that was the situation. I don\u2122t know at what point my parents \u0152 my moth er decided that she should use \u0152 not \u0152 to sell not only our personal clothing, but also household items. I don\u2122t know whether it was in that \u0152 in the wintertime or later on in the spring, but just all of a sudden she got this bright idea of \u0152 of using the cases \u0152 we had brought mattress cases. In Greece \u0152 in Greece you protect everything you have, like ma ttress, you have to have a case for the mattress, to protect it from dust. And so we \u0152 when we came to the village, we brought these mattress cases with us, and we stuffed them with hay to make mattresses. So my mother, out of desperation she had this brilliant idea, said, I have these mattress cases. I Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 68can \u0152 I can use them to make pants for \u0152 for boys, or men. These \u0152 the villagers are dressed in rags. And \u0152 but these mattress cases, usually, they have very bright stripes, red stripes. So my father said, nobody is going to wear these ridiculous looking pants, with these bright stripes. And then he thought further and said well, we \u0152 we can dye them, we can dye them brown. And that was my fathe r\u2122s great opportunity to experiment and he \u0152 he said, we\u2122ll gather shells of \u0152 walnut shells, and they were plentiful in the \u0152 in the \u0152 in the fields, and \u0152 and poppies. So this must ha ve happened in the spring, early spring, and there are lots of poppies in \u0152 growing in \u0152 in the mountains. So he made this concoction, boiled walnut shells with the poppies, creating this brown gooey material, and dipped these mattress cases when they came, and boiled them for a few minutes, and then they turned brown. Later on I found out that \u0152 that in colonial times they used walnuts to dye wool and \u0152 and fabric. So \u0152 so my mother made pants fo r \u0152 for boys, and then she used sheets, the sheets that we brought, to make shirts for men. And so she had all these wares to exchange for food, then she went from village to village with my brother, doing that. And she\u2122d come home with \u0152 w ith cheese or bread or \u0152 ever ything was delicious to us, anything was delicious."

So there were times he had to cross a creek, or a \u0152 a river [indecipherable] that was not \u0152 not a very deep river, but he \u0152 he came down with aches on his legs, and then he had the dizzy spells. He had a few medical problems that had \u0152 had the \u0152 they were left unattended, although there were a couple of occasions when my mother and brother, they walked a long distance to a village called Tatarna that had a hospital for the partisans, and there was a doctor there. They consulted with him, and the doctor gave them some medicine Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 70for my father, but somehow the villagers and us had managed to recover whatever ailments we had, on our own. So that was the situation in the winter. It was a very desperate situation. Then when spring came, there were \u0152 things were a little better because they gave us a short \u0152 a small plot to cultivate. And then there were mulberries.

But it was a very difficult period, and my mothe r, she bore the brunt of it, she really did. That is the reason why, throughout this period she kept saying that I will go myself down to the city and bring a horse-load of food. And \u0152 and there were groups of villagers that were going to the city. And she said, I\u2122ll just join one of them and go down into the city. And my father and brother al ways say no, no, absolutely not. And she would say why? The villagers go. And \u0152 and she \u0152 they would say, yeah, but you\u2122re not an ordinary villager, you \u0152 you\u2122re Jewish. And she said, well, I have an I.D. card, because they \u0152 my parents had acquired I.D. cards issued by \u0152 by the Germans. The priests of the village provided them with baptismal papers and so the papers were given to the German authorities. The names had \u0152 we re changed.

But the \u0152 the ironic thing is that in the I.D., they do not ask for religion. It\u2122s rather bizarre. Perhaps they didn\u2122t want to raise suspicions that \u0152 because tha-that was one of the reasons why many Jews in the cities, such as Ioannina did not feel threatened, did not feel that they Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 71should leave, they should go into hiding, because the Ge rmans were careful not to raise suspicions of what was awaiting them. And \u0152 and in fact, the letters that we were receiving from my relatives in Ioannina were \u0152 were, you know, why don\u2122t you come to Ioannina, we have plenty of food.

And there were many cases of Jews who returned. They had left the city and gone to the countryside to hide. And because nothing was happening in the cities, they returned, and they were eventually arrested. But my \u0152 my father, my brother were \u0152 an-and my mother were determined to stay in the village.

And so she \u0152 she went with \u0152 with a group of villagers down to Agrinion . This is very rough terrain, and all on foot. She walk ed for 12 hours, Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 72until she reached a village very close to Agrinion . I believe it was called Frangokisa(ph). Frangokisa(ph). And she had given \u0152 ther e was a young man, boy, who \u0152 to whom my mother had given a slice of bread. She had \u0152 she brought two slices of bread, one for herself \u0152 well, for herself, both of them, but she was so tired, she asked him, would you let me ride the mule if I ga ve you a slice of bread? And \u0152 and he did. And while they were doing this transaction, all of a sudden she hears her name, you know, Mrs. Matsas, Mrs. Matsas. And that was \u0152 it turned out it was a friend of ours that they knew from Arta, and her husband was the math teacher of my brother. What a coincidence, in this wilderness. And her name was Zvolise (ph). And she said, Mrs. Matsas, where are you going, why are you here, where you should be far away from here. And went on to say, haven\u2122t you heard, haven\u2122t you heard what happened to your people? And then she went on to say, you know, the Jews of Arta and Preveza and Ioannina have all been arrested. The Jews of Arta and Preveza are now housed in the Papapetrou tobacco warehouses and I don\u2122t kn ow where they took the Jews of Ioannina. And this is the first time that my mother learns of the fate of our relatives. It was a very \u0152 a very painful, unbelievable news that she heard, it was \u0152 she was totally devastated, crushed."

            "answer": "That was a very affluent village, and it had this hospital for the partisans and then the villagers. One of the \u0152 the doctors there at one point was Thanos (ph) Papatheodoro (ph), a very fine man, whose family also lived in the vicinity. And a \u0152 it\u2122s just a si \u0152 it was a \u0152 quite a coincidence, my mother and brother met them, met the family and the doctor and there were three daughters, Hera, Ephemia(ph) and Irini(ph), or Nini(ph). And the middle one, Ephemia (ph) became my best friend after the war. We\u2122re friends to this day. And there were \u0152 they were \u0152 played a very important role in the family, in my development. They were a very cultured family, and it was through them that I was exposed to classical music and paintings. Her father was an amateur painter. A very refined person. And \u0152 and this is the hospita l where my f \u0152 my brother was asked by the doctor \u0152 I don\u2122t know whether it was Dr. Papatheodoro (ph) or Dr. Panopoulous (ph), the earlier doctor, asked my father to sing the ma \u0152 I\u2122m sorry, my brother Mykas (ph), he was known as Mykas(ph) partisan songs. And my \u0152 my f \u0152 brother loved those partisan songs, they were in the air, everywhere. They were very idealistic, describing a wonderful society that is going to be built after the war, a society that was free of ignorance and poverty and injus tice. And all of these wonderful ideas appealed to him as Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 74a young person. And so he \u0152 he learned all those wonderful songs. He sings them to this day. I \u0152 I learned a few of them, but he was the one who \u0152 who sang them, and he had a beautiful voice, he still does. So now I will come back to the \u0152 to this encounter of my mother with Mrs. Volis (ph). So Mrs. Volis(ph) tells her that you have to leave as soon as possible. She talked to her husband, Mr. Volis (ph), and he suggested that \u0152 n-now my mother actually, even at this point, she said \u0152 she insisted that she go into the city, in spite of all this. She said, we\u2122re starving, we \u0152 we have to get some f ood. And so her husband recommended that she go to another village called Kamaro\u00fala, where he has a kombarro(ph). Kombarro(ph) is a godfather. And his name was Christos Zambarros (ph), and he \u0152 he was a teacher, and he said, he will help you. So my mother started walking alone with this horrible knowledge of \u0152 of what had happened to our people, to Kamaro\u00fala . She recognizes the house where this man lived, knocks on the door several time, they do not answer. Eventu ally they open the door very cautiously, they let her in very quickly, and she \u0152 she told them who she was and who \u0152 who sent her to them, and she said, I\u2122m looking for Christos Zambarros (ph). These were the sisters of Christos, and they said \u0152 they were \u0152 they were frightened because the Germans has searched their house moments before my moth er arrived. They took her to the window and they said \u0152 pointed to the \u0152 to the square and said, look down there. You see, the Germans are still there and they\u2122re still searching for peop le there. They were searching for partisans, because at this point the \u0152 the resistance had grown very strong and they Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 75were sabotaging the German advance a nd German actions; blowing bridges and destroying roads. And so they sa id, take this ker \u0152 they gave her a kerchief quickly, said put it on, and just pretend that you are our aunt from Psilovrahos . Don\u2122t say anything. They sent for their brother and he came, and my mother explained to him what was ha \u0152 what happened, and begged him to \u0152 to go \u0152 I think \u0152 I think wh at happened \u0152 I don\u2122t know \u0152 I\u2122m not so sure at this point whether she had to go to their country home where a deaf mute aunt was guarding their store \u0152 the food supplies. I don\u2122t know where this meeting with Christos Zambarros (ph) took place, but he was very, very nice, and understood the situation, and he said, don\u2122t worry. I will go down to \u0152 into the city, and I will do my best to bring a horse-load of \u0152 of food. So in the meantime, my mother was waiting in this country home with this deaf mute aunt. This \u0152 Kamaro\u00fala was very close to Agrinion . And a few hours later he returned, but without a horse-load of food, and explained to my mother that the Germans were very watchful now, that they did not allow any food to leave the city. And they had \u0152 they had executed resistance fighters already in the city, about 200 of them. So the situation had really become very hard, very tough. And they said, the only thing that I was able to bring from your friends, your neighbors, were tea, a bottle \u0152 a bottle of quinine tablets, and some matches. Very useful things, but not what we expect ed. So \u0152 so my mother took this me \u0152 these few items and started walking back to our city \u0152 to the village. And at one point she \u0152 she met Pepola (ph) Hannah (ph). He was a re \u0152 a Jewish resi stance fighter, a nd he already knew Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 76what had happened. So they fell into each ot her\u2122s arms and they cried and it was a very, very emotional experience for my mother. But she had to rush \u0152 I should tell you that there were a lot of Jewish young men that ha d joined the resistance up in the mountains. They have left their \u0152 their families to \u0152 to save themselves, and they joined the resistance. Unfortunately, a number of them, they joined the resistance, the \u0152 the andartes, but then they were afraid of reprisals by the Germans against their families, and so they returned. But a numb er of them stayed in the m ountains. So they had to rush to \u0152 Christos (ph) and my mother \u0152 th-the partisan s did not allow anybody to walk after sundown, and it was close to sundown. So they climbed a hill, and at the top of the hill was a little chapel, a little church that Christos\u2122 grandfather had built. And so they spent the night there, and this was Saint Elias chapel. And then the next day they said goodbye, and there is my mother bearing this horribl e news, alone, walking alone from this place, Kamaro\u00fala , all the way to Psilovrahos, bearing the news alone, and crying all the time. So when she came back, at that point my brother, my f \u0152 and my father were outdoors working on this plot of land that they gave us to cultivate, and when they saw her coming, she was walking very slowly, they st arted to laugh, and they said, didn\u2122t we tell you not to go? You came back \u0152 she came back three days later and she \u0152 she was planning to stay for seven or eight days in Agrinion . We told you not to go. And my mother was in terrible physical shape, b earing the horrible news and she said, don\u2122t laugh. Come in the house and when I tell you what happened, you will cry with bitter Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 77tears. And so she told us, and we were \u0152 we were just devastated. And I remember this scene. I had never, ever seen my mother in that state. Her eyes were \u0152 her \u0152 her feet were swollen, her face was swollen, her eyes were red, and she was physically exhausted and emotionally just absolutely drained. So we were just \u0152 just \u0152 just shocked. It took us \u0152 took a long time for \u0152 to recover from this shock, and the only thing that sort of brought a ray of hope that sustained us was the possibility that they were taken to Krak\u00f3w , Poland, because that was the rumors that circulated when they deported the Jews of Salonika , that they were being relocated to \u0152 to Krak\u00f3w to establish their own Jewish community, to be self-governed with their own mayor, to establish synagogues wh erever they wanted. So we thought that th \u0152 these Jews as well, from Ioannina , Arta and Preveza , that that was their destination. And you know, my pare nts said, we have to do something, but \u0152 but what can we do in \u0152 we\u2122re in this remote village, what can we do? But my father knew that there was a contingent of the British mission in Greece in a nearby village, because the British, throughout the war, were there helping the war effort behind the scenes. Helping the resistance. The British were there helping the resistance, even though later on, after the war, the British were instrumental in preventing communism from becoming established in Greece. But we \u0152 my father knew of this British mission, and he said we \u0152 we \u0152 we have to contact them. We should write letters and we should send a letter to the \u0152 he said, the nations of the world have to know what\u2122s happening, they have to do something to stop it. We didn\u2122t rea lly know what was \u0152 you know, anything about Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 78the Final Solution or what diabolic plans of the Nazis were at this point. So \u0152 so my father decided to write a letter addressed to the British government. And the letter, that was going to be delivered to my aunt and uncle, who resided in Alexandria in Egypt, and they in turn would give the letter to the Greek government in exile, which was in Egypt. It all sounds so na\u00efve now, but at the time it was a way of doing something. And so sure enough, my father composed these letters and \u0152 and my mother and brother again, were to deliver these letters to the village of Priantza. They didn\u2122t know where Priantza was, they had to \u0152 to ask many people to find their way to Priantza . So they finally arrive in Priantza and the \u0152 the British officials are willing to meet with them. And my mother, when she came back, she described that they \u0152 they walked into a large room, and they sat on two chairs, my brother and \u0152 and her, and facing these British officers, and they told them what had happened, and they \u0152 they begged them to deliver these letters. And the British officers, they accepted the letters, but they didn\u2122t sound very reassuring. In fact, one of them said to my mother, you know \u0152 and I don\u2122t know if it was his wife and children or \u0152 or some other rela tive, they \u0152 you know, my wife and children died in the bombing in London, and \u0152 and that \u0152 I have to bear that loss. So my mother was in tears because she felt they were not giving her any encouraging words. And so they left with my brother and felt that this was a fruitless mission. I don\u2122t know whether these letters were ever de-delivered to \u0152 to anybody. But one \u0152 one good thing that they discovered while in Priantza , there were a lot of parachute drops that they were \u0152 th-they Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 79were delivering supplies to the British officers in the British mission, and \u0152 and so the villagers in Priantza had a lot of this material. So much of it they didn\u2122t know what to do with it. And so when my mother discovered that this material was plentiful, she went from house to house asking for some of this parachute material, it \u2122s like a dark, khaki kind of greenish fabric, and rope from the pa rachutes. And so when they returned home after their mission, my brother came into the hou \u0152 room with this big bundle of parachute material. And that was like gold for us , because my mother finally had fabric to sew dresses, blouses, and so on. But I \u0152 from what I recall, we did not dwell on this. Th-There weren\u2122t many discussions about this betw een my parents, about the deportation of the Jews. And \u0152 and th-the hope that we ma intained throughout the war was that they were relocated to Poland, and when the war is over, they will return. We were \u0152 my parents were primarily concerned with my grandparents, because they were in their late years, and they were very concerned about them, if they would be \u0152 they\u2122ll be able to survive. So then \u0152 so my mo ther started working again, sewing the dresses and blouses and resuming her bartering activities with my brother, from village to village. And that really was very, very helpful, because now it\u2122s summertime, the villagers have more food to exchange for \u0152 for dresses, and so the situation, the food situation improved with the \u0152 with the weather, you k now, spring and summer.

And we went to Kremasta, and this place was just teeming with people. There were a lot of partisans, ardat \u0152 andartes , recuperating andartes. Many of them were injured, and they were recuperating there. There were villagers that had orthopedic problems, and they would \u0152 would \u0152 would come to Kremasta for the baths. The baths were supposed to cure everything. And my mother st \u0152 I remember her saying how people would come curled up in a basket on a mule, take the baths and then they would walk straight, you know, without the assistance of a cane or anything. I mean, there were miraculous cures. So we \u0152 we shared a room with another wo man and her child, and we started going into these baths, they were constructed of cement, and they would get filled up with this water that was \u0152 smelled of sulfur, like rotten eggs. And my mother kept saying, well this is very good, you know. I couldn\u2122t bear the smell \u0152 this is \u0152 this is very good for you. And th-the following day my fa \u0152 my brother joined us, and it was a sort of a nice, little vacation. But unfortunately came to an abrupt end when the captain of the unit of the partisans that were stationed in Kremasta announced that th-the \u0152 first of all, the partisans had to go back to their units, wherever they belonged, and the villa \u0152 villagers had to go back home because the Germans were advancing towards that area. So, people panicked, they immediately stopped their bath s and they started just a huge group of Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 86people, some on canes or sticks \u0152 not canes, but sticks, or \u0152 or mules and horses, going back to their homes. And so when we reached the village with my mother and brother, the village was in a state of excitement, because this time all of the villagers were going to leave the village. They \u0152 with their animals, because the \u0152 at this point the Germans had become very aggressive towards the villagers, who at the beginning they were trying to appease, but now the villagers were supporting the resistance by providing them with shelter and food and so these \u0152 th-the Germans were carrying out retaliations against the villagers by executing them, or burning the villages. So that was known, and so everybody was leaving the village with their animals. And my father was in the process of baking bread in the \u0152"

            "answer": "\u0152 his famous homemade oven. And there wa s no time for the bread to \u0152 to \u0152 to bake completely. This reminds me of the exodus from Egypt, with Moses . And \u0152 and now we, again we pack as many things as we possibly could. And this time we don\u2122t have any mules to transport things, so we have to travel light, with one blanket and very few food supplies. And so everybody is leaving the vi llage, and this time we go to another \u0152 a place much higher than the earlier place of Chiandafelis . This place is called Kamaria . And so the entire village, with their animals, they camp this plateau at the top of the mountain, which offered a very good vantage point view of the villages below, not only Psilovrahos but the other surrounding villages. And so there we are, it\u2122s August, the sun Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 87is burning, there\u2122s no \u0152 they \u0152 we \u0152 we had brought the canteen, a small canteen full of water, but it was very quickly exhausted. The villagers knew of a \u0152 a spring, which my brother used to fill up the canteen again, but still not enough water. The villagers, because they knew the terrain very well, and they were used to this rough terrain, they were able to discover other sources of water, but \u0152 but not us. So my father actually had to \u0152 to go from villager to villager begging for a little bit of water to fill the canteen. And I remember we were allowed only three gulps of water, you know, no more, because it had to last. The other problem was that we didn\u2122t have \u0152 we brought only one blanket and it was very cold at night up at the top of th e mountain, so my father borrowed a blanket from one of the villagers. And we decided \u0152 my parents decided that it would be best if we didn\u2122t stay with the rest of the villagers, but went to a secluded place, so in case the Germans came to Kamaria , they wouldn\u2122t find us. So again we were separated, we were separated from the rest of the villagers, and we found a secluded place and my mother or father or Mykas (ph) caught a goat, a stray goat, and we milked it. So we had a little bit of milk. And so we \u0152 we stayed in this place. Now, my mother was in \u0152 she was sick, she had fever, she was in very, very bad shape, because she had gone to \u0152 to Kremasta to recuperate from her ordeals, and now, all of a sudden, she has to go up to the mountains again. And I \u0152 I remember this \u0152 my brother doesn\u2122t remember this, but my \u0152 but I do \u0152 my mother saying, if the Germans come here, Mykas(ph) will take Ninetta, climb a rock and then a tree. And Father should hide somewhere, and I will throw all of our Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 88belongings off this \u0152 on the \u0152 off the precipice and I will get all \u0152 you know, fall off the precipice as well, not to leave a trace of our presence there. And for me, you know my mother, who was a pillar of strength, to say such thing was a very \u0152 a very shaky \u0152 shook me up. And probably that\u2122s the reason why I remember it. So we \u0152 from \u0152 from this location, we were able to see fires being set on the villages below. And it was, you know, one village after the other being set on fire, systematically. And they had reached our village, Psilovrahos , and they began to burn those houses as well. And \u0152 and it was \u0152 it was horrible, because these people were very poor to begin with, and now they\u2122re losing \u0152 to lose their house and their household, it \u0152 it was awful. But then, suddenly, the fire stopped \u0152 the sa \u0152 fires in Psilovrahos . They had burned a few houses, but then the \u0152 the f \u0152 the fire stopped. And we didn\u2122t know what had happened, but later on \u0152 in fact, on my last visit to Psilovrahos in 2005, some of the villagers told me what had happened. One of the villagers, his name was Bulumbashez(ph), a-an old, elderly person, became so infuriated with what was happening, that he defied the danger and he started coming down the m \u0152 the mountain with his cane and he had binoculars, creating a lot of commotion as the rocks were tumbling down, and the two Germans with the torches that were setting the houses on fire, they thought that the andartes were coming down. An-And so they stopped and left. And \u0152 and so this man really saved the village from \u0152 from being burned to the ground. So it \u0152 there\u2122s so many things that I learned afterwards, and at the time \u0152 Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 89"

            "question": "And so, did you then go to Agrinion ?",
            "answer": "Yes, then my \u0152 I \u0152 I believe they sent my brother first, with \u0152 with Baba (ph) Yoros (ph) with a horse loa \u0152 load of food, because by then we had \u0152 having sold all these little dresses made out of the parachute, my mother had collected a lot of wheat. Because she would sell dresses to people who didn\u2122t have wheat, but with a promise that when Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 98they harvest, they would \u0152 she would be paid at harvest time. So now we have quite a bit of wheat to transport into the city. So \u0152 so my brother and \u0152 and this Baba(ph) Yoros(ph) and the mule, or horse, I don\u2122t know what it was, they come down into the city. I \u0152 I \u0152 I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m glad that I \u0152 you asked me this question, because I didn\u2122t say anything about Baba(ph) Yoros (ph). There was a time, after the first time that \u0152 which was in November \u0152 when we had to leave Psilovrahos and go to Chiandafelis\u2122 house. There was another time when we had to leave the village. I don\u2122t remember which month it was, but this time my father and Mykas(ph) decided to leave the village, but my mother decided to stay, to guard whatever food we had. So my mother and I stayed in the house, and we were joined by the wife of Mr. Lavee(ph), her name was [indecipherable] , and she spoke German, and at one point she actually sp oke with the Germans, and she claims that she protected the upper village of Psilovrahos from the Germans. I don\u2122t know, this is a story that I\u2122m not very clear on. But \u0152 so my mother and I slept in the room, and then early next morning we hear a knock on th e door. And we woke up, and there was Baba(ph) Yoros (ph), who was a neighbor, he was a retired policeman, and his son was a partisan. And Baba(ph) Yoros (ph) said to my mother, what are you doing here with your child? If the Germans were to come to the village and \u0152 and take you and your child, I will never, ever forgive myself. And so when my mother heard that, she ha \u0152 didn\u2122t have to hear anything more, she packed quickly a nd \u0152 and \u0152 and she packed more than \u0152 than she could carry, and she \u0152 in her memoir she says how she \u0152 she didn\u2122t want to leave the Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 99\u0152 the things that she packed, which was food and \u0152 and a blanket, but at the same time she realized that she couldn\u2122t carry it. And at that point, Mrs. Tsulamitsu(ph), this \u0152 the \u0152 the mother of this \u0152 of the seven daughters who my mother was tutoring and knitting and crocheting and making lace, she appeared with her mule, and \u0152 and she saw my mother in \u0152 in this \u0152 in distress, and she said, oh don\u2122 t worry, I will carry all of your belongings. And so, with her, we reached the upper village, and \u0152 and so this is how we stand this time when the \u0152 the Germans \u0152 that was their second foray in to our region, but this time they never reached the village, and \u0152 and so \u0152 and so we all returned. So this is Baba(ph) Yoros (ph) who played a significant part in \u0152 in ou r story. As I said, th-the people really \u0152 they tried to \u0152 to help in any way they \u0152 they could, including th-the priest. You know, we \u0152 we used to go to the church, first of all to \u0152 not to sh ow that we were any different than the other villagers, and also to eat some food there, because whenever there was a \u0152 a memorial service, they would serve koliva, which is a mixture of boiled wheat and pomegranates, cinnamon and sugar. It\u2122s a very nutritious, delicious thing, but we\u2122d go there and \u0152 and the relatives of the deceased would give everybody a handful of this and so there was another source of food for us . And the priest, I don\u2122t remember his name. Papa Demetrius (ph), perhaps. I don\u2122t remember his na me. He used to come to our house quite often, because he befriended my parents. And my mother would always serve him coffee, which was a rare find, a ra \u0152 a re \u0152 a real treat for him. And he would chat with my father. I don\u2122t know what they talked about, but we went to \u0152 attended even Easter Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 100services \u0152 Friday, Good Friday services. And this is the time when \u0152 I learned later on, you know, after the war, I \u0152 I used to go to the church with my friends a lot. And so as I said earlier, I knew a lot more about the Chris tian religion than \u0152 than the Jewish religion. But on Fridays, when Jesus has been crucified and \u0152 and he\u2122s dead, and the priest is supposed to exhort his flock to \u0152 to move them, that this wonderful human being sacrificed his \u0152 his life t-to save you. He\u2122s \u0152 and so he would \u0152 he \u0152 he \u0152 he would ha \u0152 he had to give a sermon to make people cry, especially the old women cry, and so he had to go on and on with the crucifixion and the pain that he suffered on the cross. And so Sunday they celebrated Easter, the resurrection, he came to our house and apologized to my parents for having to give this kind of sermon in front of us. So i-it was, of course, appreciated by my parents. He was a kind man, and he said, what can I do? I\u2122m expected to do that, I\u2122m expected to give this kind of sermon. So now, go back to my brother and Baba(ph) Yoros (ph), they\u2122re returning to the villa \u0152 to Agrinion . And so my \u0152 my brother arrived with \u0152 with food, to Agrinion . And then, after a few days, my parents and I came down into the city."

And when I was visiting Nina, I remember she \u0152 I stayed with her f-for a number of days, and every morning sh e would serve breakfast, and I wanted to ask her \u0152 and every morning I\u2122d say no, maybe she \u0152 she doesn\u2122t want to talk about it. Until at one point, I don\u2122t remember exactly how it came up, she said to me, you know, I was interviewed by Steven Spielberg\u2122s project. And \u0152 and I said, you did? A-And \u0152 and \u0152 and I \u0152 and this was the first time that I realized that she had talked about it. This is in Ioannina now, there used to be \u0152 there used to be two synagogues before the war. One was demolished and the adjacent school, the Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle was torn down, and they used that spot \u0152 land to bu ild an apartment house for the Jews from Ioannina who survived either by going up in the mountains, or concentration camp survivors. And they live in that apartment house on Josef Elijia Street. And that is the name of \u0152 of a Greek Jewish poet from Ioannina , they named the stre et after him. But the \u0152 the horrible thing that I discovered on \u0152 after I made a tour of the \u0152 of the neighborhood where my aunt \u0152 my cousin pointed out all the houses of our relatives. This Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 111is where Aunt ri \u0152 Annetta(ph) and Aunt Eftyhia lived, and where my grandparents lived. When I returned to the apartment house, I saw this graffiti written in an ungrammatical way, saying, you die at 17 an d we bury you at 70. It was obviously an anti-Semitic graffiti on this building that houses the remnants of that thriving community. This is a community that numbered 2,000 \u0152 almost 2,000 Jews. An ancient community that had existed there for many, many centuries. And there are th \u0152 a handful of people who live in this apartment house with painful memories, and they have to \u0152 to read this every day. So I asked her, wh y don\u2122t you \u0152 why don\u2122t you hire somebod y to erase it? And said, we do it, and \u0152 and they come back, and they come back. I-It was \u0152 so my \u0152 my knowledge of concentration camps was not from our relatives that survived, yes."

I mean, is that where some of your memori es come from? Or it is mainly from the memoirs that they wrote?",
            "answer": "They always talked about our adventure in the mountains, always. And they didn\u2122t put it down on paper until they were in the United States already. And it was really, as my father says in his memoirs, always the driving force behind us. Because by then my brother had two daughters, and I had the daug hter, and we realized that they had this treasure of information that should be reco rded. And so we both, ma \u0152 my brother Mykas(ph) and I urged them to \u0152 to write down their memoirs. And I promised my father Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 112I was going to translate them, and I did. Bu t my mother, I do remember the stories she came back with after her first visit of Ioannina, when she went to visit her sisters\u2122 house, Eftyhia and Annetta(ph), they were both married, and they had, each of them, two daughters. And they \u0152 and she said that the neighbors \u0152 there was also a woman, Stavrypoulo (ph) I believe, who occupied my aunts\u2122 house at the time, and she was a mistress of one of the German officers who lived in my aunt\u2122s house, Aunt Eftyhia\u2122s house. And my aunt \u0152 my uncle \u0152 Aunt Eftyhia\u2122s husband Naseem (ph) Samwheel(ph) was a dentist, and they were well-off, they had a very pretty house, very comfortable. And so the German officer chose to \u0152 their \u0152 that house to live in. And my aunt would serve him meals every day. She was actually expecting a child, and yet she had to go up and down to serve him. And my mother learned this story when she came to Ioannina that first visit after the war, that the \u0152 this German officer asked my aunt to bring more wine that na \u0152 particular night. And she said, tomorrow we don\u2122t know who lives and who dies. And so she brought more wine, it was a very sumptuous meal that she had prepared. And it was the very next day, March 21 st \u0152 25th \u0152 March 25th, when they rounded up the Jews of Ioannina \u0152 of Ioannina . They had to be awakened very early in the morning. It was an unusually cold day, it was actually snowing. And \u0152 and they knocked the door very early in the morning, 5:30 in the morning, people were still sleeping, and they told them, you have, you know, 60 minutes to pack and assemble in the sert \u0152 in a square by the \u0152 by the lake, Pamvotis Lake, of Ioannina . And this is what Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 113they did, and \u0152 and so my aunt \u0152 this is all totally unexpected, because up until that point, things were relatively calm in the city, and so this was an unsuspecting Jewish population that all of a sudden is rounded up. And so my aunt approach ed the \u0152 this German officer, and said, we too? You know, y ou lived with us, and I served you so many meals, we too? He said, yes, you too. And my uncle was still shaving, and it was a very \u0152 a horrible situa \u0152 a horrible scene that my mother described. And now in retrospect, when I think \u0152 when I think of it, it\u2122s very, very painful. Because I can \u0152 I can just picture now my grandparents being awakened early in the morning, in their later years in their lives; small children, pregnant women, they had to \u0152 to pack. What \u0152 what could \u0152 they didn\u2122t know what to pack, what to bri \u0152 they didn\u2122t know where th ey were going. And when I bring that scene in my mind, I \u0152 I can\u2122t \u0152 it\u2122s so pa inful, so painful. And then my grandmother was a very kind person. She was \u0152 she had many children and she was a self-trained midwife. And she was a \u0152 and \u0152 and my grandf ather had a lot of transactions with the villagers, because he used to buy milk from them. So she would \u0152 so they had a lot of people that they knew in the villages, and whenever a woman was expecting a child, they would always ask my mother \u0152 my grandmothe r to come and help her deliver the baby. So my grandmother would always go around the neighborhood collecting baby clothes and food for \u0152 for the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the mother, the young mother and the baby. And so she was that kind of person. And why was she taken away? There was a \u0152 a book that someone wrote, I can\u2122t remember her name right now, about the Jewish community of Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 114Ioannina, and the deportation. And she interviewed survivors that were brought in in the same \u0152 the same truck with my grandmot her. No, actually the same \u0152 they were transported by trucks from Ioannina to Larisa (ph), and from Larisa(ph) in boxcars to Auschwitz. And these women survived the concentration camps and they were interviewed by the author of this book, and they happened to be riding in the same boxcar. And their \u0152 a relative of theirs was expecting a baby, and her mother-in-law was frantic, because what are we going to do? How is the \u0152 the mother and the baby going to survive? And \u0152 and they quoted my grandmother, saying, d-do n\u2122t worry, I\u2122ll deliver the baby. I know all about babies, I\u2122ll take care of you. So I don\u2122t know whether she delivered \u0152 whether she delivered the baby in the boxcar, or when they arrived in the concentration camp. But I do know that they we re among the first peopl e to \u0152 to go to the gas chambers, because they \u0152 they had \u0152 they \u0152 they took the elderly and the very young to the gas chambers. And so that was the en d of these wonderful people. It\u2122s something [indecipherable] my brother and I live with this \u0152 this pain all our lives. And it\u2122s just \u0152 there\u2122s no \u0152 there\u2122s just no answer, there\u2122s \u0152 there\u2122s no answer, and \u0152 and what makes it so painful for \u0152 for us is that there was a possibility they could have been s \u0152 they could have survived, they could have \u0152 it was late enough in the war. The countryside was free. The partisans were there. They could ha \u0152 Greece is a mountainous country, they could have left, they could have survived. And it di dn\u2122t happen. It \u0152 it\u2122s a \u0152 we\u2122ll \u0152 we\u2122ll just never \u0152 we\u2122ll never rest. I-It\u2122s a pain we\u2122ll never \u0152 always carry with us. When I went to Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 115Ioannina in 2005, I went to the synagogue, the only remaining synagogue inside the \u0152 the walls, the castle, th-the fro\u00fario, as they call it, that\u2122s still standing there, and it was renovated thanks to the generosity of Amer ican women o-of that background. And the walls are lined with marble plaques on which the names of all the victims, all the people who were deported, on marble plaques with the day of \u0152 the date of their birth \u0152 the names and the date of their birth. And th-the entire synagogue interior is \u0152 is covered with these plaques. It was my Uncle Mikhail(ph) that the \u0152 a younger brother of my father, wa \u0152 he\u2122s a survivor of the concentration camp, he\u2122s the one who collected all the information; the names, the occupations, date of births of all the people who perished, and then they etched their names in marble an-and \u0152 and there is a \u0152 it\u2122s a \u0152 a good monument, you know, a way to remember them . But it is \u0152 it is so painful to think \u0152 when I was in that synagogue, I \u0152 I had already learned a lot about the history of \u0152 of the community, and how rich their lives were, rich in \u0152 in long traditions, they \u0152 these unchanged traditions for hundreds of years. And it all perished overnight, literally overnight. So with \u0152 with my aunt \u0152 with my cousin Nina , when we were in the synagogue, and Mr. Samwheel(ph), who joined the partisans during the war, and this is how he survived, he joined them as a young man. Now, when I visited he was an elderly person. But he \u0152 he had a beau tiful voice, and he knew how to play a musical instrument. And he took it upon himself to \u0152 to learn the liturgy, because he\u2122s the one who condu \u0152 conducts services in the synagogue, only very few times, on like Yom Kippur. That is Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 116when relatives and friends from other cities in Greece, they come to the synagogue. And so \u0152 so he \u0152 he chants the liturgy. And while we were there, the three of us; my cousin Nina, a survivor of Auschwitz ; he, a partisan; and I, we recited Kaddish. And it was the most memorable moment of my life. And when I looked at the wall, there were the names of our relatives, and \u0152 and cousins that were my age when they were taken. And I s-sort of \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I appreciate life. I\u2122m very consci ous that I was \u0152 I was just very, very, very lucky to survive. So I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m one of the very few \u0152 among the very few Greek Jewish survivors. And \u0152 and now I\u2122m \u0152 we\u2122re \u0152 I\u2122m eter nally grateful to whoever ever helped us to survive those terrible years. And there were many people with small acts of \u0152 of \u0152 just a kind word here and there, or giving us a sip of water up in Kamaria , or \u0152 or the blanket, in spite of the lice, they \u0152 they shared everything they had, and I am \u0152 we\u2122re the \u0152 eternally grateful t-to them an-and to the place of Psilovrahos. Psilovrahos is a very special, special, very special place for me. I\u2122m sorry."

So when my Aunt Rebecca, who was my father\u2122s youngest sister, and she and her family survived in Egypt, see, because they lived in Alexandria during the war, then after the [indecipherable] took over, and they had to \u0152 to leave Egypt, they came to Paris. Well, she came to visit us about maybe 10 years ago. And she had left Ioannina when she was 17 years old. She got married to my Uncle Laylee(ph), and then they moved to \u0152 to Alexandria, Egypt . So she would come back to visit her family. So she retained that period of \u0152 of \u0152 of the family as though it was encased in am ber.

I was not a professional interviewer, of course, but I \u0152 I really treasure the information that she gave me, because for a brief period of time, she brought these people to life. And they were \u0152 they had their own ac hievements in life, their own disappointments and \u0152 and while in life pe rhaps they were ordinary people, having perished the way they did, they became extraordinary."
