And that -- that was -- But, we were not church-goer. First of all, there was quite a long distance to church. And, by the way, my grandmother was not very fond of the minister.

            "answer": "You see that, in Denmark, we ha -- for all the years when I was young, mixed government between the social democrats and a radical party. And, you must recall that, in the 30\u2019s, after the Black Wednesday in \u201929, Denmark had had very -- indeed, very bad economical conditions. A big part of our -- our export was agriculture, and the first -- everybody stopped in Britain, was our biggest market, that was agriculture products. So there was a really big unemployment in Denmark in the beginning of the 30\u2019s, and there was, even then, not any tension t -- revolution or to Communism, all this, because there was a social welfare in Denmark. A social welfare, which was backed up even by the more conservative parties, so there was uni -- unity about -- to give the people who was not so good off as we, a helping hand. And after \u201936, it turns a little bit, and in \u00b038, just before the war, we had a reasonable good situation, and of course the social democrat got the credit for that, and that is okay. And, at the same time, a certain Mr. Hitler, made his number in -- in Germany. We thought that Hitler was a clown. We und-underestimated that guy. His screaming, his completely directed reviews. He -- When we saw him in the picture -- the pictures of him, when we -- when we heard him in -- in the radio, on -- on film, or this newsreels, it was -- w-we couldn\u2019t understa -- we really thought the man must be crazy. And that gave Denmark an injection against narcissism, because that was also completely foolish for us to believe that anybody are supermen. I never forget, we as Danes, was so -- the best of all the Aryans, with our blue eyes, our blonde hair, and -- and all this. And we couldn\u2019t u-understand anything out of -- and therefore, in Denmark, there was a feeling of certainness, that that guy could never be a threat. That was \u00b036 - \u00b037. There was a -- that w -- I say, here was not something I knew that time, because as 10 years old, you are not that interest. But, the [indecipherable] was that when he had passed the bridge over Rhine, the river Rhine, and taking over the old German socketbeat without, and he was shooting at him. Maybe the whole world could have -- be something else today, this day in April, in \u201999, where we talk about Kosovo. If somebody had shot at the German army crossing the bridges over Rhine in 1936, maybe millions of people had been alive today. I don\u2019t know, but I say it because that gis -- my impression what\u2019s right or wrong in Kosovo."

            "answer": "I can say the day exactly, the ninth of April, 1940, I woke up and -- because there was airplanes in the air. We had -- To see an airplane in that -- the -- in those days, that was something special, but here was lots of them, coming up from south, over the river Sund, and they were -- the destination were Norway, because that was the day Hitler occupied Denmark and Norway. And then they came back and they -- then went over Copenhagen, and we have heard about the bombardment of Wachau, in the year before, when the start of the war started, and afterwards, we got the -- the message that Hitler has threatened to bomb Copenhagen if we did not -- gave up and sign the treaty that let -- he should take over the power and -- and all this. And we had that time, 13,000 soldier, that was all, and somebody was killed at the -- at the border between Ge-Germany and Denmark. That day I got my impression what -- a man who have made a non-aggressive treaty with us, and broke it, that man was no good, and he was certainly not a clown, but he was a threat. And from the -- that day, I -- I despised the man, and the regime. But I think that goes for many, many, many. I was 13 years, that ni-ninth of April, and it was strange because I had to go to the station. I went to school in Copenhagen, that was a dri -- a drive of about an hour or so, and non -- in the train, I\u2019ve heard about it. We have to -- seen the planes and all this, but when we came to the -- to Copenhagen, we had to stop one station before Norbel, and w-w-w -- had to go out of the train and up in the streets, we heard the German soldiers. And that was a shock. I was really in shock. And -- But we could do nothing. [indecipherable] dreams that you can have a gun and shoot, all that. Well, wund- it became a normal day later. Where we lived, we saw no German soldiers. I saw them when I was a-at school in Copenhagen, and I really think Denmark 1s a sha -- I remember that\u2019s the first time in all our history, we have lost all freedom. And I know it s-seems maybe a little pathetic, but freedom is something you don\u2019t talk about, and don\u2019t know exists until you lose it. Then you\u2019ll find out what it means. This -- To live, one day ina country with law and order, the next in a country where you do not know what is law and order, because the other set up what you have to be and say, that is difficult. All this -- For instance, with the news. From one day to another, we just had one side of the news. And that was the main reason that we young people, of course, guided by grown-ups, came in -- very young in the illegal press work. As paper boys, we distributed -- and to me it was very clear. I went to school in Copenhagen, I lived on the country side in -- in Willet, so it was naturally I had some papers with me, and gave them to people who I knew would en -- would use them right, because that was all informations. W-W-We tried to listen to BBC, but the Germans make some disturbings jop, so it was very difficult. You should have seen all the antennas you tried to make, in order to get the news from BBC, three times a day. And, again, BBC was the truthful news media. But, maybe they\u2019ll be just as muss -- misunderstandings from their side. Beeb -- The -- The German\u2019s news from the different fronts, was always taken as 100 percent lies. But on the other side, in the fort -- in \u201940, what happened? Holland, Belgium, France fell. Dunkirk. It was a very, very sad time. It was very difficult to keep up this stee. That was - And our government, we had a government at that time, the-they make collaboration with the Germans, which we didn\u2019t like. We -- We thought they were cowards. That\u2019s easy to say when you are not sitting at the fir -- in the first row, but that was a very shameful feeling, that we have failed, that we now saw that England was very, very hard pressed, and there was none in Europe, who could help. Never forget that on -- in the \u201940, they had still the pact between Stalin and Hitler. It was just -- there was no way out of it."

But, I thought, naive as I was, that unity in Europe could make us a better continent. And I really think we have achieved quite a lot in that way. I really think that for the first time in history, there\u2019s not being a war in 50 years between central European states. We have, of course, now down at the Balkan, but we have not have this war between England, France and Germany. England an-and -- and France, to be the master of Europe. We have had this union which -- and my idea of a -- a union 1s what Charles DeGaulle said, a Europe of the Fatherlands.

The -- I was not less Danes when I returned than before, I really think that. W-We had a much easier time during the war than most part. Only Sweden had it better.

We -- And the situation between the nations in Europe is much better than it was before, and so we have learned by the war, f-for Denmark to go into NATO, that\u2019s okay.

D-Do you think there is a genuine interest, or is it perhaps maybe just a kind of a fad, or how do you make sense of it?",
            "answer": "It\u2019s very difficult, because we have seen, after the war, many thing which goes near Holocaust. We see it today in Kosovo, we saw it at Rwanda some years ago. We see it in Sudan, Muslims again Christian, we see that in India. We see that in the former Soviet Union. I think that it\u2019s also the interest in -- in avoiding -- avoiding a new Holocaust. Therefore, I -- when I participate, many times, it 1 -- a part of an Holocaust education, and I really think that the Holocaust education maybe can give us some answers how to avoid it. 1 mean, education is one of the things, when you see round the world, people living next to each other in different countries, they believe the other country will do that and that and vice-a - versa. And they fear it, they don\u2019t know. The more we\u2019re able to know about our neighbor countries -- neighbor countries, it will help. I don\u2019t believe that we are able to make countries love each other, but could we, through education, make them hate a little less, we would had achieved quite a lot. But, I think it\u2019s so important, with the Holocaust education, and a part of the Holocaust education is also \u201cSchindler\u2019s List.\u201d Last year here, we watch a preview of a picture about the Danish rescue of the Jews, and it was not so special, truthful, but it was a good story, and -- but it gives the impression all the time, that we can do something. Not to avoid it, but to dimin-diminish the results of it. We -- We must do something, we must learn people to do what we, as Christian or Jews, are taught. That we are our brothers and sisters keeper. If we live up to that, I really think that it will be a much easier way to live, and a more lucky world."
